A '''KLM Lockheed L-049 Constellation''' airliner (named ''[[Nijmegen]]'' and registered PH-TEN) crashed into high ground near [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport]], Scotland, on 20 October 1948; all 40 aboard died.&lt;ref name=barkerp108&gt;{{harvnb|Barker|1988|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent inquiry found that the accident was likely caused by the crew's reliance on a combination of erroneous charts and incomplete weather forecasts, causing the crew to become distracted and disoriented in the inclement conditions.

==The flight==

===Events prior to approach===
The aircraft was piloted by Koene Dirk Parmentier, one of the winners of the [[MacRobertson Air Race]], widely regarded as one of the great flyers of the era, and KLM's chief pilot. The co-pilot on the flight was Kevin Joseph O'Brien.&lt;ref name=lyons&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aircrashsites-scotland.co.uk/constellation_mauchline.htm |title=Constellation PH-TEN |accessdate=31 May 2009 |publisher=Air Crash Sites Scotland |author=Gordon Lyons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nijmegen'' was scheduled to fly from its home base at [[Schiphol Airport]] near [[Amsterdam]] at 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Central European Time|CET]] to New York via [[Glasgow Prestwick International Airport|Prestwick]], with [[Shannon Airport]] in Ireland as the alternative stopover point in case of bad weather at Prestwick. The plane's departure was delayed as additional cargo was loaded for transport to [[Iceland]], which would be an additional stop en route from Prestwick to New York.&lt;ref name=barkerp109110&gt;{{harvnb|Barker|1988|pp=109&amp;ndash;110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plane eventually left Schiphol at 9:10&amp;nbsp;p.m., crossed the English coast at [[Flamborough Head]] and then flew towards [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] before turning and flying up the Scottish coast towards Prestwick.&lt;ref name=barkerp110&gt;{{harvnb|Barker|1988|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[weather forecast]] Parmentier had been given by the [[Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute]] at Schiphol had told him that there was some slight cloud at Prestwick, but that it would likely dissipate by the time the ''Nijmegen'' arrived.&lt;ref name=barkerp109&gt;{{harvnb|Barker|1988|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report was incorrect; the weather at Prestwick was steadily deteriorating,&lt;ref name=barkerp109/&gt; with the weather at the alternative destination of Shannon even worse.&lt;ref name=lyons/&gt;

Parmentier believed that there was a strong [[crosswind]], blowing at [[right-angle]]s to the main runway (Runway 32) at Prestwick of about 20&amp;nbsp;[[Knot (unit)|knots]], which might prevent a [[landing]] on it.&lt;ref name=barkerp110/&gt; Prestwick had a second, alternative, runway (Runway 26) which was heading into the wind but had no [[radar]]-approach system. However, KLM pilot guidelines drafted by Parmentier himself, forbade a landing at Prestwick in low cloud on the alternative runway.&lt;ref name=barkerp110/&gt;

By the time of approach, Prestwick was under [[drizzle]] and a cloud-base that was almost solid at {{nowrap|600 feet (180 m)}}, forecast to continue from about 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. onwards, around the time the ''Nijmegen'' was approaching the [[airfield]].&lt;ref name=barkerp110/&gt; As the flight had taken off late, they had not picked up the radio message [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] by Prestwick airfield informing them of this.&lt;ref name=barkerp110/&gt; Parmentier was thus unaware of the deterioration in the weather: were he aware of it he would have been able to divert to Shannon. The routine weather reports broadcast from Prestwick had given a cloud cover of {{nowrap|700 feet (210 m)}}.&lt;ref name=barkerp111&gt;{{harvnb|Barker|1988|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; No new forecasts, which would have told Parmentier of the expected decreased cloud cover were broadcast. Nor did he know that already that evening two airliners from [[Scandinavian Airlines System|SAS]] had turned back rather than attempt a landing at Prestwick.&lt;ref name=barkerp116&gt;{{harvnb|Barker|1988|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inland of the runway was high ground of over {{nowrap|400 feet (120 m)}},&lt;ref name=barkerp110/&gt; but the KLM-issued charts which the crew were using did not mark any land higher than {{nowrap|250 feet (75 m)}}.&lt;ref name=barkerp117&gt;{{harvnb|Barker|1988|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three miles &lt;!-- nautical or statute? --&gt; (5&amp;nbsp;km) to the north-east of the runway, rising to over {{nowrap|600 feet (180 m)}}, were a set of [[wireless]] [[Radio masts and towers|masts]]. {{nowrap|Three miles (5 km)}} inland ran a series of [[electricity pylon]]s and high-tension cables, the main [[Electric power transmission|national grid]] line for South Scotland, carrying 132,000&amp;nbsp;volts. However the error-riddled charts gave the height of the cables at only {{nowrap|45 feet (14 m)}}.&lt;ref name=barkerp117/&gt;

===Approach and crash===
[[Image:Crash Site Of Lockheed Constellation PH-TEN - geograph.org.uk - 1399523.jpg|thumb|The hill where the aircraft crashed. The picture was taken in 2007]] 
The plane made radio contact with approach control at Prestwick shortly before 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. At this point the cross-wind over the main runway had, unknown to Parmentier, dropped to 14&amp;nbsp;knots which made it within limits to attempt a landing on the main runway.&lt;ref name=barkerp112&gt;{{harvnb|Barker|1988|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he decided to attempt an overshoot of the main runway guided by the ground radar controller, followed by a left-hand turn that would bring the plane [[downwind]] of the alternate runway. He would then overfly the runway before looping round for his final approach.&lt;ref name=barkerp111/&gt; While it might sound complicated, Parmentier expected to be in visual contact with the ground which would make such an attempt relatively easy.

At 11:16&amp;nbsp;p.m. Prestwick broadcast a [[morse code|morse]] message warning of the deteriorating weather, however as the ''Nijmegen'' had now switched over to voice contact the message would not have been received. On the approach they were told of the decreased cross-wind and decided to attempt a landing on the main runway after all.&lt;ref name=barkerp112113&gt;{{harvnb|Barker|1988|pp=112&amp;ndash;113}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, three miles out Parmentier decided that the wind was probably too strong for landing on the main runway and decided to overshoot and land on the alternate.&lt;ref name=barkerp114&gt;{{harvnb|Barker|1988|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; He overflew Runway 26, the lights of which he could now see, climbed to a height of {{nowrap|450 feet (140 m)}} and extended the [[landing gear]] ready for landing. At this point they ran into what Parmentier believed was an isolated patch of cloud. However this was the actual cloud-base, which was now as low as {{nowrap|300 feet (90 m)}} in some areas.&lt;ref name=barkerp117/&gt; At this point the ''Nijmegen'' was headed directly for the power cables at {{nowrap|450 feet (140 m),}} which the crew believed to be substantially lower.&lt;ref name=barkerp117/&gt;

Parmentier realised the 'isolated fog' he had run into was getting denser, but due to his belief that they would have visual contact with the ground the crew had not attempted to time their flight downwind of the runway.&lt;ref name=barkerp117/&gt; Before he could abort the attempt, the plane crashed into the electricity cables, hitting the main phase conductor line. The crew attempted to turn the now burning aircraft towards the runway with the intent of an emergency landing. However, the faulty charts led them to crash into high ground five miles east-north-east of the airfield&lt;ref name=barkerp119&gt;{{harvnb|Barker|1988|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; at about 23:32 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19481020-0|title=Accident description|publisher=Aviation Safety Network|accessdate=2014-11-18}} Contemporary British reports, e.g. ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper (October 1948) and the Court of Investigation report (November 1949), cite the accident as occurring early on 21 October.&lt;/ref&gt;

All 30 passengers (22 Dutch, 6 German, 1 British and 1 Irish&lt;ref name=barkerp110/&gt;) and the 10 crew died. Rescue services did not reach the crash-site for over one and a half hours due to confusion over which service was responsible for responding to the crash. By the time they arrived only six people were still alive, and all died within 24 hours.&lt;ref name=barkerp120&gt;{{harvnb|Barker|1988|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court of enquiry==
The subsequent court of enquiry blamed several factors for the crash:
*The failure of the ground authorities to inform the ''Nijmegen'' of the deterioration in the weather.
*The failure of the crew to time their flight downwind of the runway.
*The errors in the official KLM approach chart the crew had relied on. It emerged during the enquiry that these charts had been copied from [[World War II|war-era]] [[United States Air Force]] charts, which upon subsequent examination were also found to be faulty. The court of enquiry was astonished to find that KLM had relied on maps from a foreign authority when detailed and correct maps were available from the [[Ordnance Survey]], the United Kingdom's national mapping authority.&lt;ref name=barkerp120121&gt;{{harvnb|Barker|1988|pp=120&amp;ndash;121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enquiry determined the probable cause for the accident was:
{{quotation|
#That when the pilot started his landing manoeuvre for runway 26 of Prestwick Airport the weather conditions were already below the limits for this manoeuvre but that from the weather forecasts received this could not be known to him and that this could not be personally judged at the time.
#That, although the landing on runway 26 under the weather conditions, as far as these were known to the pilot, required the greatest caution, the pilot could not be blamed for having commenced that landing procedure.
#That flying too long on the downwind-leg of runway 26 caused the accident.
#That, if no unknown circumstances contributed to the extension of the flight on the downwind-leg of runway 26, the extension was due to the delayed action of the pilot after he lost visual approach.
#That it was not impossible that a stronger wind that the pilot accounted for contributed to the extension of the flight on the downwind-leg of runway 26.
#That the possibility of other circumstances as mentioned under 4 could not be ruled out, but that no data was available which could give cause for the supposition that they contributed to the extension of the flight at a low altitude on the downwind-leg of runway 26.|{{ASN accident|id=19481020-0}}}}

[[File:807_tube_pinout.png|thumb|right|807 tube [[pinout]] diagram]]

The '''807''' is a [[beam tetrode]] [[vacuum tube]], widely used in [[Audio frequency|audio-]] and [[radio-frequency]] power amplifier applications.

==Audio uses==
807s were used in [[Valve audio amplifier|audio power amplifiers]], both for [[public address]] and [[hi-fi]] application, usually being run in push-pull pairs in class AB1 or AB2 giving up to 120 watts of usable power. The plate voltage limit is 750 volts and the screen grid limited to 300 volts. Because of the 300 volt screen grid voltage limit, the 807 cannot be triode connected for high power applications. Failure to observe this precaution will cause screen grid failure. Less commonly a single 807 was used in a pure class-A, single-ended audio output stage delivering about 10 watts.

The 807 is not a good choice of tube for typical [[Ultra-Linear]] amplifier circuits, as the maximum screen voltage at 300 V is less than half the maximum plate voltage of 750 V. A possible solution is to use an [[Transformer types#Output transformer|output transformer]] with a separate ultralinear screen winding, such as the [[Acrosound]] TO-350.

==RF uses==
The 807 is fully rated to 60&amp;nbsp;MHz, derated to 55% at 125&amp;nbsp;MHz in Class C, Plate-modulated operation, thus they were popular with [[amateur radio]] operators (radio hams). 
In this application a single 807 could be run in class-C as an oscillator or amplifier which could be keyed on and off to transmit [[Morse Code]] in [[Continuous wave|CW]] mode. For voice transmission on [[amplitude modulation|AM]] a final amplifier with one or more 807s, up to about four, could be connected in parallel running class-C. Connecting multiple 807s in parallel produced more power to feed to the antenna. Often the modulator stage (simply a transformer-coupled audio amplifier for A.M., with the secondary of its output transformer in series with the anode supply of the final amplifier), was also constructed using 807s. Many hams found multiple paralleled 807s a cheaper alternative to a single larger valve, such as a single 813, as many military surplus 807s became available cheaply after World War II. In Australia 807s are affectionately referred to as "[[beer bottle#Stubby|stubbies]]" because they are almost as ubiquitous as that common Australian beer container.&lt;br /&gt;
The class C operational values in the info box at the right are for ''anode modulated A.M. operation''; for CW operation a maximum anode voltage of 600 is permissible, whereby the anode current increases to 100 mA and the anode/plate dissipation rises to 25 watts. The screen voltage is the same, at 300, but its dissipation rises to 3.5 watts.
37 watts of R.F. power is produced from 220&amp;nbsp;mW of drive but only a 50% [[duty cycle]] is allowed. The maximum allowable negative ''control grid, g1'' excursion allowable is -200 volts and average control grid current is 5mA in both A.M. and CW modes.&lt;ref&gt;R.C.A. Air-Cooled Transmitting Tubes, Technical Manual TT3, R.C.A. Manufacturing Company Ltd. Harrison, New Jersey, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;
Later versions could be used on CW with a supply voltage up to 750 V and a current of 100 mA to produce 50-55 watts of output power.

==Differences from 6L6==
The electrically similar [[6L6]] was not favored by hams because high transient voltages on the anode when operating in class C could cause a [[electric arc|flashover]] between pins 2 and 3 on the octal base, whereas the 807 had the anode connected to a top cap, physically distant from all the base pins.

==Derivatives==
The '''1624''' ('''VT-165''') is an 807 variant with a directly heated filamentary cathode operating at 2.5 V, 2 A.

The '''1625''' ('''VT-136''') is an 807 variant with a 12.6 V heater and a 7-pin base. These tubes were used as RF power amplifiers in some of the SCR-274 and [[AN/ARC-5]] "command set" transmitters of [[WW2]]. Postwar, 1625 tubes flooded the surplus market, and were available for pennies apiece. Surplus 1625s found some commercial use, notably the use of a pair as modulator tubes in the [[Heathkit#Early DX-series transmitters|Heathkit DX-100 amateur transmitter.]]

The '''HY-69''' is an 807 variant with a [[Tube socket#Other socket styles|5-pin base]] and a directly heated filamentary cathode operating at 6.3 V, 1.6 A.

The '''5933'''/'''807W''' is a ruggedized military version of the 807. It uses a shorter, straight-sided T12 bulb, which provides better element support for improved microphonics and shock/vibration resistance.

The ATS-25 is a military version with ceramic base.

The Г-807 (G-807) is a Soviet/Russian version. The 6П7С (6P7S) is similar to Г-807, but with an 8-pin octal base.

The 807 also found some use as a horizontal output tube in early TV receivers, particularly those manufactured by [[DuMont Laboratories|DuMont]]. The 807 design (with some "[[value engineering]]" to reduce production cost) was the basis for the first application-specific horizontal sweep tubes such as the '''6BG6G''' and '''6CD6G'''. The redesign mainly involved the omission of some of the internal RF shielding, and the substitution of a bakelite [[Tube socket#Octal|Octal base]] for the micanol or ceramic 5-pin.

The '''American Brass Superfund site''' is a former industrial site,  located in [[Henry County, Alabama]]. American Brass Inc. (ABI) operated a brass smelter and foundry facility on the site between 1978-1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=American Brass Inc.|work=Region 4 Superfund|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=March 1, 2012|accessdate=April 24, 2013|url=http://www.epa.gov/region4/superfund/sites/npl/alabama/amerbrasal.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its closure in December 1992, the company had been cited by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), and the [[Alabama Department of Environmental Management]], (ADEM), on several occasions for [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) violations, arising from its waste and hazardous waste disposal processes.&lt;ref name="rod"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Record Of Decision: American Brass Inc.|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=August 24, 2006|accessdate=April 24, 2013|url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/rods/fulltext/r2006040001226.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Site surveys, conducted by ADEM after ABI ceased operations, revealed stockpiles of 150,000 tons of contaminated waste, and extensive soil and groundwater contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=NPL Site Narrative for American Brass Inc.|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=May 10, 1999|accessdate=April 24, 2013|url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/nplsnl/n0406299.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Belleville washer''', also known as a '''coned-disc spring''',&lt;ref name="shigley"&gt;{{Citation|last=Shigley|first=Joseph Edward|last2=Mischke|first2=Charles R.|last3=Brown|first3=Thomas H.|title=Standard handbook of machine design|page=640|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2004|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mafom8J9sqYC&amp;pg=PT150|isbn=978-0-07-144164-3|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''conical spring washer''',&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{Citation|last=Smith|first=Carroll|author-link=Carroll Smith|title=Carroll Smith's Nuts, Bolts, Fasteners, and Plumbing Handbook|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing Company|year=1990|page=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A81HmmRCN7YC&amp;pg=PA116|isbn=0-87938-406-9|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''disc spring''', '''Belleville spring''' or '''cupped spring washer,''' is a conical shell which can be loaded along its axis either statically or dynamically. A Belleville washer is a type of [[Spring (device)|spring]] shaped like a [[Washer (mechanical)|washer]]. It is the [[Frustum|frusto]]-[[Cone (geometry)|conical]] shape that gives the washer its characteristic spring.

The "Belleville" name comes from the inventor [[:Fr:Julien Belleville|Julien Belleville]] who in [[Dunkerque]], France, in 1867 patented a spring design which already contained the principle of the disc spring.&lt;ref name="shigley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhandari"&gt;{{Citation|last=Bhandari|first=V. B.|title=Design of Machine Elements|page=441|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill|year=2010|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DAYjIkeUwkC&amp;pg=PA441&amp;dq=Belleville|isbn=978-0-07-068179-8|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The real inventor of Belleville washers is unknown.

Through the years, a lot of different profiles for disc springs have been developed. Today the most used are the profiles with or without
contact flats, while some other profiles, like disc springs with trapezoidal cross-section, have lost importance.

== Features and use ==
[[Image:M1-M4 mine cutaway.png|thumb|right|Cross-sectional view of an [[M1 mine|M4 anti-tank mine]] (circa 1945) showing the steel belleville spring in the [[fuze]] mechanism]]
[[Image:M14 mine cutaway - internal view.png|right|thumb|Cut-away view of an [[M14 mine|M14 antipersonnel landmine]], showing the [[firing pin]] mounted in the centre of a plastic belleville spring]]
In the different fields, if they are used as springs or to apply a flexible pre-load to a [[bolted joint]] or bearing, Belleville washers can be used as a single spring or as a stack. In a spring-stack, disc springs can be stacked in the same or in an alternating orientation and of course it is possible to stack packets of multiple springs stacked in the same direction.

Disc springs have a number of advantageous properties compared to other types of springs:&lt;ref name="schnorr"&gt;{{Citation|title=Schnorr Handbook|publisher=Schnorr|year=2016|url=http://schnorr.com/download/disc-spring-handbook/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Very large loads can be supported with a small installation space,
* Due to the nearly unlimited number of possible combinations of individual disc springs, the characteristic curve and the column length can be further varied within additional limits,
* High service life under dynamic load if the spring is properly dimensioned,
* Provided the permissible stress is not exceeded, no impermissible relaxation occurs,
* With suitable arrangement, a large damping (high hysteresis) effect may be achieved,
* Because the springs are of an annular shape, force transmission is absolutely concentric.
Thanks to these advantageous properties, Belleville washers are today used in a large number of fields, some examples are listed in the following.

In the arms industry, Belleville springs are used, for instance, in a number of [[landmines]] e.g. the American [[M19 mine|M19]], [[M15 mine|M15]], [[M14 mine|M14]], [[M1 mine|M1]] and the Swedish Tret-Mi.59. The target (a person or vehicle) exerts pressure on the belleville spring, causing it to exceed a trigger threshold and flip the adjacent [[firing pin]] downwards into a stab [[detonator]], firing both it and the surrounding [[Explosive booster|booster charge]] and main explosive filling.

Belleville washers have been used as return springs in artillery pieces, one example being the French Canet range of marine/coastal cannon from the late 1800s (75&amp;nbsp;mm, 120mm, 152&amp;nbsp;mm).

Some makers of [[bolt action]] target rifles use Belleville washer stacks in the bolt instead of a more traditional spring to release the firing pin, as they reduce the time between trigger actuation and firing pin impact on the cartridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Actionclear Modern Rifles|url=http://www.actionclear.com.au/product_list.php?page_id=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belleville washers, without serrations which can harm the clamping surface, have no significant locking capability in bolted applications. &lt;ref&gt;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19900009424.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Belleville washers, when used on the mounting bolts, are also useful as an indicator of swelling or shrinkage of wooden propellers on aircraft (typically experimental aircraft).  By torquing their associated bolts to provide a specific gap between sets of washers placed with "high ends" facing each other, a change in relative moisture content in the propeller wood will result in a change of the gaps which is often great enough to be detected visually.  As propeller balance depends on the weight of blades being equal, a radical difference in Belleville washer gaps may indicate a difference in moisture content—and thus weight—in the adjacent blades.

As they provide extremely detailed tuning ability, disc springs are used in the automotive (even in [[Formula One]] cars&lt;ref name="formula1"&gt;{{Citation|title=Infiniti Red Bull RB10 Renault|url=http://www.f1technical.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=17681&amp;start=1575|isbn=|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and aircraft industries as vibration-damping elements: the Cirrus SR2x series, uses a Belleville washer setup to damp out nose gear oscillations (or "shimmy").&lt;ref name="cirrus"&gt;{{Citation|title=Cirrus airplane maintenance manual|page=32,34|publisher=Cirrus|year=2014|url=http://servicecenters.cirrusdesign.com/techpubs/pdf/AMM/SR20/pdf/32-20.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the building industry, in Japan stacks of disc springs have been used under buildings as vibration dampers for earthquakes.&lt;ref name="japan"&gt;{{Citation|last=Nakamura|first=Takashi|last2=Suzuki|first2=Tetsuo|last3=Nobata|first3=Arihide|title=Study on earthquake response characteristics of base-isolated building using the friction dampers with coned disc springs|pages=2901–2906|publisher=Proceedings of the 10th Earthquake Engineering Symposium|year=1998|url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/wcee/article/1891.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stacking ==
Multiple Belleville washers may be stacked to modify the [[spring constant]] (or spring rate) or the amount of [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]]. Stacking in the same direction will add the spring constant in parallel, creating a stiffer joint (with the same deflection). Stacking in an alternating direction is the same as adding common springs in series, resulting in a lower spring constant and greater deflection. Mixing and matching directions allow a specific spring constant and deflection capacity to be designed.

Generally, if '''n''' disc springs are stacked in parallel (facing the same direction), standing the load, the deflection of the whole stack is equal to that of one disc spring divided by '''n''', then, to obtain the same deflection of a single disc spring the load to apply has to be '''n''' times that of a single disc spring. On the other hand, if '''n''' washers are stacked in series (facing in alternating directions), standing the load, the deflection is equal to '''n''' times that of one washer while the load to apply at the whole stack to obtain the same deflection of one disc spring has to be that of a single disc spring divided by '''n'''.

== Performance considerations ==
In a parallel stack, hysteresis (load losses) will occur due to friction between the springs. The hysteresis losses can be advantageous in some systems because of the added damping and dissipation of vibration energy. This loss due to friction can be calculated using hysteresis methods. Ideally, no more than 4 springs should be placed in parallel. If a greater load is required, then factor of safety must be increased in order to compensate for loss of load due to friction. Friction loss is not as much of an issue in series stacks

In a series stack, the deflection is not exactly proportional to the number of springs. This is because of a ''bottoming out'' effect when the springs are compressed to flat as the contact surface area increases once the spring is deflected beyond 95%. This decreases the moment arm and the spring will offer a greater spring resistance. Hysteresis can be used to calculate predicted deflections in a series stack. The number of springs used in a series stack is not as much of an issue as in parallel stacks even if, generally, the stack height should not be greater than three times the outside diameter of the disc spring. If it is not possible to avoid a longer stack, then it should be divided into 2 or possibly 3 partial stacks with suitable washers. These washers should be guided as exactly as possible.

As previously said, Belleville washers are useful for adjustments because different thicknesses can be swapped in and out and they can be configured to achieve essentially infinite tunability of spring rate while only filling up a small part of the technician's tool box. They are ideal in situations where a heavy spring force is required with minimal free length and compression before reaching solid height. The downside, though, is weight, and they are severely travel limited compared to a conventional coil spring when free length is not an issue.

A [[wave washer]] also acts as a spring, but wave washers of comparable size do not produce as much force as Belleville washers, nor can they be stacked in series.

== Disc springs with contact flats and reduced thickness ==
For disc springs with a thickness of more than 6.0&amp;nbsp;mm, DIN 2093 specifies small contact surfaces at points I and III (that is the point where the load is applied and the point where the load touches the ground) in addition to the rounded corners.  These contact flats improve definition of the point of load application and, particularly for spring stacks, reduce friction at the guide rod. The result is a considerable reduction in the lever arm length and a corresponding increase in the spring load. This is in turn compensated for by a reduction in the spring thickness.

The reduced thickness is specified in accordance with the following conditions:&lt;ref name="schnorr"/&gt;
* The overall height remains unaltered,
* The width of the contact flats (that is the annulus width) is to be approximately 1/150 of the outside diameter,
* The load applied to the reduced-thickness spring to obtain a deflection equal to the 75% of the free height (of an unreduced spring) must be the same as for an unreduced spring.
As the overall height is not reduced, springs with reduced thickness inevitably have an increased flank angle and a greater cone height than springs of the same nominal dimension without reduced thickness.&lt;ref name="schnorr"/&gt; Therefore, the characteristic curve is altered and becomes completely different.

== Calculation ==
Starting from 1936, when J. O. Almen e A.Làszlò published a simplified method of calculation,&lt;ref name="Almen2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Almen|first=J. O.|last2=Làszlò|first2=A.|title=The uniform-section disk spring|pages=305–314|publisher=ASME 58|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; always more accurate and complex methods appeared also in order to include in calculations disc springs with contact flats and reduced thickness. So, although today there are more accurate methods of calculation,&lt;ref name="Curti"&gt;{{Citation|last=Curti|first=Graziano|last2=Orlando|first2=M.|title=A new calculation of coned annular disc springs|pages=199–204|publisher=Wire(28) 5|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most used are the simple and convenient formulas of DIN 2092 as, for standard dimensions, they produce values which correspond well to the measured results.

Considering a Belleville washer with outside diameter &lt;math&gt;{D_e}&lt;/math&gt;, inside diameter &lt;math&gt;{D_i}&lt;/math&gt;, height ''l'' and thickness ''t'', where &lt;math&gt;{h_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the free height, that is the difference between the height and the thickness, the following coefficients are obtained:

: &lt;math&gt;\delta=\frac{D_e}{D_i}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;{C_1}=\frac{\left(\frac{t'}{t}\right)^2}{\left(\frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{l}{t}-\frac{t'}{t}+\frac{3}{4}\right)\cdot{\left(\frac{5}{8}\cdot\frac{l}{t}-\frac{t'}{t}+\frac{3}{8}\right)} }&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;{C_2}=\frac{C_1}{\left(\frac{t'}{t}\right)^3}\cdot\left[\frac{5}{32}\cdot\left(\frac{l}{t}-1\right)^2+1\right] &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;{K_4}=\sqrt{-\frac{C_1}{2}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{C_1}{2}\right)^2+C_2}}&lt;/math&gt;
The equation to calculate the load to apply to a single disc spring in order to obtain a deflection ''s'' is:&lt;ref name="din92"&gt;{{Citation|title=DIN 2092: Disc springs - Calculation|publisher=DIN|year=2006|url=https://www.beuth.de/en/standard/din-2092/85244476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;F=\frac{4E}{1-\mu^2}\cdot\frac{t^4}{K_1-{D_e}^2}\cdot{K_4}^2\cdot\frac{s}{t}\cdot\left
[{K_4}^2\cdot\left(\frac{h_0}{t}-\frac{s}{t}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{h_0}{t}-\frac{s}{2t}\right)+1\right] &lt;/math&gt;

Note that for disc springs with constant thickness, ''t''' is equal to ''t'' and consequently &lt;math&gt;{K_4}&lt;/math&gt; is 1.

For what concerns disc springs with contact flats and reduced thickness it has to be said that a paper published on July 2013, demonstrated that the &lt;math&gt;{K_4}&lt;/math&gt; equation as defined inside the standard norms is not correct as it would result in every reduced thickness being considered right and this is, of course, impossible. As written in that paper &lt;math&gt;{K_4}&lt;/math&gt; should be replaced with a new coefficient, &lt;math&gt;{R_d}&lt;/math&gt;, which depends not only from the  &lt;math&gt;\frac{t'}{t}&lt;/math&gt; ratio but also from the flank angles of the spring.&lt;ref name="Ferrari"&gt;{{Citation|last=Ferrari|first=Giammarco|title=A new calculation method for Belleville disc springs with contact flats and reduced thickness|publisher=IJMMME 3(2)|year=2013|url=http://www.igi-global.com/article/new-calculation-method-belleville-disc/77890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spring constant (or spring rate) is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;{k}=\frac{dF}{ds}&lt;/math&gt; 
[[Image:Belleville 3221.png|thumb|right|92px|2-3-1-2 stack of washers]]
If friction and bottoming-out effects are ignored, the spring rate of a stack of identical Belleville washers can be quickly approximated. Counting from one end of the stack, group by the number of adjacent washers in parallel. For example, in the stack of washers to the right, the grouping is 2-3-1-2, because there is a group of 2 washers in parallel, then a group of 3, then a single washer, then another group of 2.

The total spring coefficient is:

: &lt;math&gt;K = \frac{k}{\sum_{i=1}^g \frac{1}{n_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;K = \frac{k}{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;K = \frac{3}{7} \cdot{k}&lt;/math&gt;

Where
* &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;= the number of washers in the ith group
* g = the number of groups
* k = the spring constant of one washer
So, a 2-3-1-2 stack (or, since addition is commutative, a 3-2-2-1 stack) gives a spring constant of 3/7 that of a single washer. These same 8 washers can be arranged in a 3-3-2 configuration (K = 6/7&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;k), a 4-4 configuration (K = 2&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;k), a 2-2-2-2 configuration (K = 1/2&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;k), and various other configurations. The number of unique ways to stack ''n'' washers is defined by the [[Partition (number theory)#Partition function|integer partition function ''p''(''n'')]] and increases rapidly with large ''n'', allowing fine-tuning of the spring constant. However, each configuration will have a different length, requiring the use of [[Shim (engineering)|shims]] in most cases.

'''Biocompatibility''' is related to the behavior of [[biomaterials]] in various contexts. The term refers to the ability of a material to perform with an appropriate host response in a specific situation.&lt;ref&gt;"Biological Performance of Materials", Jonathan Black,2006, {{ISBN|0-8493-3959-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ambiguity of the term reflects the ongoing development of insights into how biomaterials interact with the [[human body]] and eventually how those interactions determine the clinical success of a [[medical device]] (such as [[pacemaker]], [[hip replacement]] or [[stent]]). Modern medical devices and [[prostheses]] are often made of more than one material so it might not always be sufficient to talk about the biocompatibility of a specific material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mddionline.com/article/considerations-biocompatibility-evaluation-medical-devices ''Considerations for the Biocompatibility Evaluation of Medical Devices''], Kammula and Morris, Medical Device &amp; Diagnostic Industry, May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[immune response]] and repair functions in the body are so complicated it is not adequate to describe the biocompatibility of a single material in relation to a single cell type or tissue. Sometimes one hears of biocompatibility testing that is a large battery of [[in vitro]] test&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emdt.co.uk/article/vitro-biocompatibility-testing-biomaterials-and-medical-devices “In Vitro Biocompatibility Testing of Biomaterials and Medical Devices”], U. Muller, Medical Device Technology, March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; that is used in accordance with [[ISO 10993]] (or other similar standards) to determine if a certain material (or rather biomedical product) is biocompatible. These tests do not determine the biocompatibility of a material,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mddionline.com/article/biocompatibility-safety-assessment-medical-devices-fdaiso-and-japanese-guidelines|title=Biocompatibility Safety Assessment of Medical Devices: FDA/ISO and Japanese Guidelines|publisher=Mddionline.com|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they constitute an important step towards the [[animal testing]] and finally [[clinical trial]]s that will determine the biocompatibility of the material in a given application, and thus [[medical device]]s such as [[implant (medicine)|implant]]s or [[drug delivery device]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reshetov|first=I.

[[Image:Annualpublbiocompatibility19702007.jpg|right|frameless]]

== History ==
The word ''biocompatibility'' seems to have been mentioned for the first time in peer-review journals and meetings in 1970 by RJ Hegyeli (Amer Chem Soc Annual Meeting abstract) and CA Homsy et al. (J Macromol Sci Chem  A4:3,615, 1970). It took almost two decades before it began to be commonly used in scientific literature (see the graph below).

Recently Williams (again) has been trying to reevaluate the current knowledge status regarding what factors determine clinical success. Doing so notes that an implant may not always have to be positively bioactive but it must not do any harm (either locally or systemically) (Williams, 2008).

==Five definitions of biocompatibility==
# "The quality of not having [[toxic]] or injurious effects on biological systems".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dorland's Medical Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
# "The ability of a material to perform with an appropriate host response in a specific application", Williams' definition.&lt;ref&gt;''The Williams dictionary of Biomaterials'', D.F. Williams, 1999, {{ISBN|0-85323-921-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Comparison of the tissue response produced through the close association of the implanted candidate material to its implant site within the host animal to that tissue response recognised and established as suitable with control materials" - [[ASTM]]
# "Refers to the ability of a biomaterial to perform its desired function with respect to a medical therapy, without eliciting any undesirable local or systemic effects in the recipient or beneficiary of that therapy, but generating the most appropriate beneficial cellular or tissue response in that specific situation, and optimising the clinically relevant performance of that therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.04.023 | volume=29 | title=On the mechanisms of biocompatibility | year=2008 | journal=Biomaterials | pages=2941–2953 | last1 = Williams | first1 = David F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Biocompatibility is the capability of a prosthesis implanted in the body to exist in harmony with tissue without causing deleterious changes".&lt;ref&gt;''International dictionary of medicine and biology'', E. L. Becker, S. I. Landau, &amp; A. Manuila, 1986, New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comments on the above five definitions==
#The Dorland Medical definition not recommended according to Williams Dictionary since it only defines biocompatibility as the absence of host response and does not include any desired or positive interactions between the host tissue and the biomaterials.
#This is also called the “Williams definition” or “William’s definition”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=D|title=Revisiting the definition of biocompatibility.|journal=Medical device technology|date=Oct 2003|volume=14|issue=8|pages=10–3|pmid=14603712}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was defined in the [[European Society for Biomaterials]] Consensus Conference I and can more easily be found in ‘The Williams Dictionary of Biomaterials’.
#The [[ASTM]] is not recommended according to Williams Dictionary since it only refers to local tissue responses, in animal models.
#The fourth is an expansion or rather more precise version of the first definition noting both that low toxicity and the one should be aware of the different demands between various medical applications of the same material.
#{{Empty section|date=August 2014}}

All these definitions deal with materials and not with devices. This is a drawback since many medical devices are made of more than one material. Much of the [[pre-clinical testing]] of the materials is not conducted on the devices but rather the material itself. But at some stage the testing will have to include the device since the shape, geometry and surface treatment etc. of the device will also affect its biocompatibility.

===‘Biocompatible’===
In the literature, one quite often stumbles upon the adjective form, ‘biocompatible’. However, according to Williams’ definition, this does not make any sense because biocompatibility is contextual, i.e. much more than just the material itself will determine the clinical outcome of the medical device of which the biomaterial is a part. This also points to one of the weaknesses with the current definition because a medical device usually is made of more than one material.

Metallic glasses based on magnesium with zinc and calcium addition are tested as the potential biocompatible metallic biomaterials for biodegradable medical implants&lt;ref&gt;Nowosielski R., Cesarz-Andraczke K., Sakiewicz P., Maciej A., Jakóbik-Kolon A., Babilas R., Corrosion of biocompatible Mg66+XZn30-XCa4 (X=0.2) bulk metallic glasses, Arch. Metall. Mater. 2016 vol. 61 iss. 2, s. 807-810,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suggested sub-definitions===
The scope of the first definition is so wide that D Williams tried to find suitable subgroups of applications in order to be able to make more narrow definitions. In the MDT article from 2003 the chosen supgroups and their definitions were:

;Biocompatibility of long-term [[Implant (medicine)|implanted devices]]
:The biocompatibility of a long-term implantable medical device refers to the ability of the device to perform its intended function, with the desired degree of incorporation in the host, without eliciting any undesirable local or systemic effects in that host.

;Biocompatibility of short-term implantable devices
:The biocompatibility of a medical device that is intentionally placed within the cardiovascular system for transient diagnostic or therapeutic purposes refers to the ability of the device to carry out its intended function within flowing blood, with minimal interaction between device and blood that adversely affects device performance, and without inducing uncontrolled activation of cellular or plasma protein cascades.

;Biocompatibility of [[tissue engineering|tissue-engineering]] products
:The biocompatibility of a scaffold or matrix for a tissue-engineering products refers to the ability to perform as a substrate that will support the appropriate cellular activity, including the facilitation of molecular and mechanical signalling systems, in order to optimise tissue regeneration, without eliciting any undesirable effects in those cells, or inducing any undesirable local or systemic responses in the eventual host.

In these definitions the notion of biocompatibility is related to devices rather than to materials as compared to top three definitions.  There was a consensus conference on biomaterial definitions in Sorrento September 15–16, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esb2005.it/satellite.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206100618/http://www.esb2005.it/satellite.html |date=February 6, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Blowing Stone 2.JPG|thumb|The Blowing Stone in its modern setting]]
The '''Blowing Stone''' is a perforated [[sarsen]] at {{gbmapping|SU32412 87083}} in [[Kingston Lisle]], [[Oxfordshire]] ([[Berkshire]] until 1974). The stone is in a garden at the foot of Blowingstone Hill just south of the [[Icknield Way|Icknield Way (B4507)]], about {{convert|4+1/2|mi|0}} west of [[Wantage]] and about {{convert|1+1/2|mi}} east of [[White Horse Hill]].

Blowingstone Hill is part of the [[escarpment]] of the [[Berkshire Downs]], at the crest of which is [[The Ridgeway#National Trail|The Ridgeway]].

==Notability==
[[File:The Blowing Stone blow hole, Kingston Lisle - geograph.org.uk - 666866.jpg|thumb|The blowing hole in the stone]]
The stone is capable of producing a booming sound if someone with the required skill blows into one of the holes the right way. According to legend it could be heard atop White Horse Hill, where 19th-century antiquarians thought King [[Alfred the Great]]'s [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] troops had camped, and that this was how Alfred summoned them for the [[Battle of Ashdown]] against the [[Danelaw|Danes]] in AD 871.

==Literature==
[[Thomas Hughes]]' novel ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' refers to it as the ''Blawing Stwun'' and calls the village ''Kingstone Lisle''.

It is also one of the "sacred stones" mentioned in William Horwood's ''[[Duncton Wood]]'', the first book in his fantasy fiction series about a group of moles.

'''Brushed''' or '''dull polished&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro-inox.org/pdf/build/Finishes02_EN.pdf |title=Brushed metal |publisher=Euro-inox |date= |accessdate=2014-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717095841/http://www.euro-inox.org/pdf/build/Finishes02_EN.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;''' metal is [[metal]] with a unidirectional satin [[Surface finishing|finish]]. It is produced by [[Polishing (metalworking)|polishing]] the metal with a 120–180 [[Grit size|grit]] belt or wheel then softening with an 80–120 grit greaseless compound or a medium non-woven abrasive belt or pad.

Commonly brushed metals include [[stainless steel]], [[aluminium]] and [[nickel]]. Brushed finishes are popular in both [[small appliance]]s and [[Major appliance|whiteware]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appliancemagazine.com/editorial.php?article=1232 |title=A Comparison of Enameled and Stainless-Steel Surfaces - Porcelain Enamel |publisher=Appliancemagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and feature in [[architecture]] and [[automotive]] design. The [[Gateway Arch]] and [[DeLorean DMC-12]] are both [[Cladding (construction)|clad]] in brushed stainless steel. The intensity of the brushed finish is specified as a [[surface roughness]] and is typically 0.5–1.5 [[micrometre]]s [[Surface roughness#Amplitude parameters|R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bssa.org.uk/topics.php?article=190 |title=Article: Specifying mechanically polished, brushed and buffed stainless steel finishes and their applications |publisher=Bssa.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

Brushing gives metal a distinctive look, as it retains some but not all of its metallic [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]] and is given a pattern of very fine lines parallel to the brushing direction. For this reason, it is commonly used for decorative items like jewelry and watches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://customjewelrytrends.com/jewelry-encyclopedia/brushed-finish/ | title=Brushed Finish | website=Custom Jewelry Trends | access-date=2015-02-10 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218024623/http://customjewelrytrends.com/jewelry-encyclopedia/brushed-finish/ | archivedate=2015-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A brushed finish is susceptible to damage. Brushed finishes also typically have a detrimental effect on [[corrosion]] resistance. In particular the brushed texture limits the ability of fluid to [[Wetting|bead]] on the material surface. In the case of stainless steel the grooves of the finish can accumulate [[chloride|chloride ions]] which break down the [[chromium]] oxide [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] layer, enabling rusting to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bssa.org.uk/cms/File/surfacefinishbssaVer2.pdf |title=Importance of Surface Finish in the Design of Stainless Steel |publisher=British Stainless Steel Association |date= |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carbon finance''' is a branch of [[environmental finance]] that covers financial tools such as [[carbon emission trading]] to reduce the impact of [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHG) on the environment by giving carbon emissions a price.

Financial risks and opportunities impact corporate balance sheets, and market-based instruments are capable of transferring environmental risk and achieving environmental objectives. Issues regarding climate change and GHG emissions must be addressed as part of strategic management decision-making.

The general term is applied to [[investments]] in GHG emission reduction projects and the creation (origination) of [[financial instruments]] that are tradeable on the [[carbon market]].

==History==
The market for the purchase of carbon has grown exponentially since its conception in 1996.

The following is the estimated size of the worldwide [[carbon market]] according to the [[World Bank]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://carbonfinance.org/docs/Carbon_Trends_2007-_FINAL_-_May_2.pdf |title=State and Trends of the Carbon Market 2007 | publisher=World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://carbonfinance.org/docs/State___Trends--formatted_06_May_10pm.pdf |title=State and Trends of the Carbon Market 2008 | publisher=World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume (millions metric tonnes, MtCO2)

*  2005:      718 (330 in Main Allowances Markets &amp; 388 in Project based transactions)
*  2006:    1,745 (1,134 in Main Allowances Markets &amp; 611 in Project based transactions)
*  2007:    2,983 (2,109 in Main Allowances Markets &amp; 874 in Project based transactions)

The 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]] recognised [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) allowing the offset of emissions in developed countries by the investment in emission reduction projects in developing countries like [[China]], [[India]] or [[Latin America]].

[[Joint Implementation]] (JI), is another mechanism that allowed investments in developed countries to generate emission credit for the same or another developed country.

== World Bank==
The [[World Bank]] has created the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit (CFU). The World Bank CFU uses money contributed by governments and companies in [[OECD]] countries to purchase project-based [[greenhouse gas emission]] reductions in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. The emission reductions are purchased through one of the CFU's carbon funds on behalf of the contributor, and within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) or Joint Implementation (JI).&lt;ref&gt;http://carbonfinance.org&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank is particularly supportive of [[Program of Activities (PoA)]] development.&lt;ref&gt;http://wbcarbonfinance.org/Router.cfm?Page=ProjPort&amp;ItemID=24702&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|lightweight, black residue, consisting of carbon and any remaining ash, obtained by removing water and other volatile constituents from animal and vegetation substances}}

'''Charcoal''' is the lightweight black [[carbon]] and ash residue [[hydrocarbon]] produced by removing water and other volatile constituents from [[animal]] and [[vegetation]] substances. Charcoal is usually produced by slow [[pyrolysis]] — the heating of [[wood]] or other substances in the absence of [[oxygen]]. This process is called [[charcoal burning]]. The finished charcoal consists largely of carbon.

The advantage of using charcoal instead of just burning wood is the removal of the water and other components. This allows charcoal to burn to a higher temperature, and give off very little smoke (regular wood gives off a good amount of steam, organic volatiles, and unburnt carbon particles — [[soot]] — in its smoke).

==History==
{{Further|Fusain|Fossil record of fire}}

{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}

Historically, the [[charcoal burning|production of wood charcoal]] in locations where there is an abundance of wood dates back to a very ancient period, and generally consists of piling billets of wood on their ends so as to form a conical pile, openings being left at the bottom to admit [[air]], with a central shaft to serve as a [[flue]]. The whole pile is covered with turf or moistened [[clay]]. The firing is begun at the
bottom of the flue, and gradually spreads outwards and upwards. The success of the operation depends upon the rate of the [[combustion]]. Under average conditions, 100 parts of wood yield about 60 parts by [[volume]], or 25 parts by [[weight]], of charcoal; small-scale production on the spot often yields only about 50%, while large-scale became efficient to about 90% even by the seventeenth century. The operation is so delicate that it was generally left to [[charcoal maker|colliers]] (professional charcoal burners). They often lived alone in small huts in order to tend their wood piles. For example, in the [[Harz Mountains]] of [[Germany]], [[charcoal burner]]s lived in conical [[huts]] called ''[[Köte]]n'' which are still much in evidence today.{{when|date=July 2014}}
[[File:Charcoal Kiln.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Walker Charcoal Kiln|An abandoned charcoal kiln]] near Walker, Arizona, USA.]]

The massive production of charcoal (at its height employing hundreds of thousands, mainly in Alpine and neighbouring forests) was a major cause of [[deforestation]], especially in [[Central Europe]].{{when|date=July 2014}} In [[England]], many woods were managed as [[coppice]]s, which were cut and regrown cyclically, so that a steady supply of charcoal would be available (in principle) forever; complaints (as early  as the [[Stuart period (England)|Stuart period]]) about shortages may relate to the results of temporary [[over-exploitation]] or the impossibility of increasing production to match growing demand. The increasing scarcity of easily harvested wood was a major factor behind the switch to [[fossil fuel]] equivalents, mainly [[coal]] and [[brown coal]] for industrial use.

The modern process of carbonizing wood, either in small pieces or as [[sawdust]] in [[cast iron]] [[retort]]s, is extensively practiced where wood is scarce, and also for the recovery of valuable byproducts ([[wood spirit]], [[pyroligneous acid]], [[tar|wood tar]]), which the process permits. The question of the [[temperature]] of the [[carbonization]] is important; according to J. Percy, wood becomes brown at 220&amp;nbsp;°C (428&amp;nbsp;°F), a deep brown-black after some time at 280&amp;nbsp;°C (536&amp;nbsp;°F), and an easily powdered mass at 310&amp;nbsp;°C (590&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="Enc Brit 856"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chisolm|first=Hugh|title=Encyclopædia Britannica, Eleventh Edition, Volume V|year=1910|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Charcoal made at 300&amp;nbsp;°C (572&amp;nbsp;°F) is brown, soft and friable, and readily inflames at 380&amp;nbsp;°C (716&amp;nbsp;°F); made at higher temperatures it is hard and brittle, and does not fire until heated to about 700&amp;nbsp;°C (1,292&amp;nbsp;°F).

In [[Finland]] and [[Scandinavia]], the charcoal was considered the by-product of [[tar|wood tar]] production. The best tar came from [[pine]], thus pinewoods were cut down for tar [[pyrolysis]]. The residual charcoal was widely used as substitute for [[metallurgy|metallurgical]] [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] in [[blast furnace]]s for [[smelting]]. Tar production led to rapid local [[deforestation]]. The end of tar production at the end of the 19th century resulted in rapid re-forestation of affected areas.

The charcoal briquette was first invented and patented by Ellsworth B. A. Zwoyer of Pennsylvania in 1897&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/inventionsalphabet/a/barbecue.htm |title=Barbeque – History of Barbecue |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was produced by the [[Zwoyer Fuel Company]]. The process was further popularized by [[Henry Ford]], who used wood and sawdust byproducts from [[History of Ford Motor Company#Early developments|automobile fabrication]] as a [[feedstock]]. Ford Charcoal went on to become the [[Kingsford (charcoal)|Kingsford Company]].

== Production methods ==
Charcoal has been made by various methods. The traditional method in [[Great Britain|Britain]] used a clamp. This is essentially a pile of wooden logs (e.g. seasoned oak) leaning against a chimney (logs are placed in a circle). The chimney consists of 4 wooden stakes held up by some rope. The logs are completely covered with soil and straw allowing no air to enter. It must be lit by introducing some burning fuel into the chimney; the logs burn very slowly and transform into charcoal in a period of 5 days' burning. If the soil covering gets torn (cracked) by the fire, additional soil is placed on the cracks. Once the burn is complete, the chimney is plugged to prevent air from entering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geoarch.co.uk/experimental/charcoal.html |title=Geoarch |publisher=Geoarch |date=1999-05-31 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040315062219/http://www.geoarch.co.uk/experimental/charcoal.html |archivedate=2004-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The true art of this production method is in managing the sufficient generation of heat (by combusting part of the wood material), and its transfer to wood parts in the process of being carbonised. A strong disadvantage of this production method is the huge amount of emissions that are harmful to human health and the environment (emissions of unburnt methane).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roland.V.  Siemons, Loek Baaijens, An Innovative Carbonisation Retort: Technology and Environmental Impact, TERMOTEHNIKA, 2012, XXXVIII, 2, 131‡138 131|url=http://www.cleanfuels.nl/Sitepdfs/Siemons_inovativne-posude-za-karbonizaciju-tehnologija-i-uticaj-na-okolinu.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the partial combustion of wood material, the efficiency of the traditional method is low.

Modern methods employ retorting technology, in which process heat is recovered from, and solely provided by, the combustion of gas released during carbonisation. (Illustration:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kilning vs. Retorting: the cause of emissions of unburnt gases.|url=http://www.cleanfuels.nl/Sitepics/Kilning-principle.png}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Yields of retorting are considerably higher than those of kilning, and may reach 35%-40%.

The properties of the charcoal produced depend on the material charred. The charring temperature is also important. Charcoal contains varying amounts of hydrogen and oxygen as well as [[Wood ash|ash]] and other impurities that, together with the structure, determine the properties. The approximate composition of charcoal for [[gunpowder]]s is sometimes empirically described as C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} To obtain a coal with high purity, source material should be free of non-volatile compounds.

==Types==

*'''Common charcoal''' is made from peat, coal, wood, coconut shell, or petroleum.
*'''Sugar charcoal''' is obtained from the carbonization of sugar and is particularly pure. It is purified by boiling with acids to remove any mineral matter and is then burned for a long time in a current of chlorine in order to remove the last traces of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Carbon|pages=305–307|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used by [[Henri Moissan]] in his early attempt to create [[synthetic diamond]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
*'''[[Activated charcoal]]''' is similar to common charcoal but is made especially for medical use. To produce activated charcoal, manufacturers heat common charcoal in the presence of a gas that causes the charcoal to develop many internal spaces or "pores". These pores help activated charcoal trap chemicals.
*'''Lump charcoal''' is a traditional charcoal made directly from [[hardwood]] material. It usually produces far less ash than briquettes.
*'''Japanese charcoal''' has had [[pyroligneous acid]] removed during the charcoal making; it therefore produces almost no smell or smoke when burned. The traditional charcoal of Japan is classified into two types:
**[[Binchōtan|White charcoal]] (''[[Binchōtan]]'') is very hard and produces a metallic sound when struck.
**{{illm|Black charcoal|ja|黒炭}}
**'''[[Biomass briquettes#Japanese Ogalite|Ogatan]]''' is a more recent type made from hardened sawdust.
*'''Pillow shaped [[briquette]]s''' are made by compressing charcoal, typically made from sawdust and other wood by-products, with a binder and other additives. The binder is usually [[starch]]. Briquettes may also include [[brown coal]] (heat source), mineral carbon (heat source), [[borax]], [[sodium nitrate]] (ignition aid), [[limestone]] (ash-whitening agent), raw [[sawdust]] (ignition aid), and other additives.
*'''Sawdust briquette charcoal''' is made by compressing sawdust without binders or additives. It is the preferred charcoal in Taiwan, Korea, Greece, and the Middle East. It has a round hole through the center, with a hexagonal intersection. It is used primarily for barbecue as it produces no odor, no smoke, little ash, high heat, and long burning hours (exceeding 4 hours).
*'''Extruded charcoal''' is made by extruding either raw ground wood or carbonized wood into logs without the use of a binder. The heat and pressure of the extruding process hold the charcoal together. If the extrusion is made from raw wood material, the extruded [[timber|logs]] are subsequently carbonized.

==Uses==
[[File:Japanese RoundStove Charcoal.JPG|thumb|Grill charcoal made from coconut shell]]

Charcoal has been used since earliest times for a large range of purposes including art and medicine, but by far its most important use has been as a metallurgical fuel. Charcoal is the traditional fuel of a blacksmith's forge and other applications where an intense heat is required. Charcoal was also used historically as a source of black [[pigment]] by grinding it up. In this form charcoal was important to early chemists and was a constituent of formulas for mixtures such as [[black powder]]. Due to its high [[surface area]] charcoal can be used as a filter, and as a [[carbocatalysis|catalyst]] or as an adsorbent.

===Metallurgical fuel===
Charcoal burns at temperatures exceeding {{convert|1100|C|abbr=none}}&lt;ref&gt;https://sciencing.com/hot-bonfire-8770.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  By comparison the melting point of [[iron]] is approximately {{convert|1200|to|1550|C}}. Due to its porosity, it is sensitive to the flow of air and the heat generated can be moderated by controlling the air flow to the fire. For this reason charcoal is still widely used by blacksmiths. Charcoal has been used for the production of iron since Roman times and [[steel]] in modern times where it also provided the necessary carbon. Charcoal briquettes can burn up to approximately {{convert|1260|C}} with a forced air blower forge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-01-01|title=Characteristics of charcoal combustion and its effects on iron-ore sintering performance|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261915012210|journal=Applied Energy|language=en|volume=161|pages=364–374|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.09.095|issn=0306-2619|last1=Cheng|first1=Zhilong|last2=Yang|first2=Jian|last3=Zhou|first3=Lang|last4=Liu|first4=Yan|last5=Wang|first5=Qiuwang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, England had to pass laws to prevent the country from becoming completely denuded of trees due to production of iron.&lt;ref&gt;23 May 1615 James 1 banned use of timber for all types of furnaces&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} In the 19th century charcoal was largely replaced by [[coke (fuel)|coke]], baked coal, in steel production due to cost.

===Industrial fuel===
Historically, charcoal was used in great quantities for smelting [[iron]] in [[bloomery|bloomeries]] and later [[blast furnace]]s and [[finery forge]]s. This use was replaced by [[coke (fuel)|coke]] in the 19th Century as part of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

===Cooking fuel===
Prior to the Industrial Revolution, charcoal was occasionally used as a cooking fuel. Modern "charcoal [[briquette]]s", widely used for outdoor cooking, are made with charcoal but may also include coal as an energy source as well as accelerants, binders and filler.

===Syngas production, automotive fuel===
Like many other sources of carbon, charcoal can be used for the production of various [[syngas]] compositions; i.e., various CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures. The syngas is typically used as fuel, including automotive propulsion, or as a chemical feedstock.

In times of scarce petroleum, automobiles and even buses have been converted to burn [[wood gas]] (a gas mixture consisting primarily of diluting [[atmospheric]] [[nitrogen]], but also containing combustible gasses, mostly [[carbon monoxide]]) released by burning charcoal or wood in a [[wood gas generator]]. In 1931 [[Tang Zhongming]] developed an automobile powered by charcoal, and these cars were popular in China until the 1950s and in [[occupied France]] during [[World War II]] (called ''gazogènes'').{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Pyrotechnics===
Charcoal is used in the production of [[gunpowder|black powder]], which is used extensively in the production of fireworks. It is usually ground into a fine powder, with airfloat grade being the finest particle size available commercially. When used in black powder compositions, it is often ball-milled with other ingredients so that they are intimately mixed together. Certain charcoals perform better when used to make black powder, these include spruce, willow, paulownia and grapevine among others.

=== Cosmetic Use of Bamboo Charcoal ===
Charcoal has started to become popular as a cosmetic product with multiple uses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmad|first=N|last2=Isa|first2=S.S.M.|last3=Ramli|first3=M.M.|last4=Hambali|first4=N.A.M.A.|last5=Kasjoo|first5=S.R.|last6=Isa|first6=M.M.|last7=Nor|first7=N.I.M.|last8=Khalid|first8=N.|date=2016|title=Adsorption Properties and Potential Applications of Bamboo Charcoal: A Review.|url=https://www.matec-conferences.org/articles/matecconf/pdf/2016/41/matecconf_icongdm2016_01097.pdf|journal=MATEC Web of Conferences|volume=78|pages=1–7|via=edp sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is created by obtaining regular bamboo, cut down into smaller pieces and then boiled in distilled water to wash it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Then it is dried out, carbonized in an oven (at roughly 800-1200 degrees Celsius) for many hours and results in raw bamboo charcoal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of charcoal in beauty routines intends to utilize its highly effective absorbing properties at a microscopic-scale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Carbon source ===
Charcoal may be used as a source of carbon in chemical reactions. One example of this is the production of [[carbon disulphide]] through the reaction of sulfur vapors with hot charcoal. In that case the wood should be charred at high temperature to reduce the residual amounts of hydrogen and oxygen that lead to side reactions.

===Purification and filtration===
[[File:Activated Carbon.jpg|thumb|right|Activated carbon]]

Charcoal may be ''activated'' to increase its effectiveness as a filter. [[Activated carbon|Activated charcoal]] readily [[Adsorption|adsorbs]] a wide range of organic compounds dissolved or suspended in gases and liquids. In certain industrial processes, such as the purification of sucrose from cane sugar, impurities cause an undesirable color, which can be removed with activated charcoal.
It is also used to absorb [[odor]]s and toxins in gases, such as air. Charcoal filters are also used in some types of [[gas mask]]s. The medical use of activated charcoal is mainly the [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] of [[toxin|poisons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawson|first1=Andrew|title=Activated charcoal: a spoonful of sugar|journal=Australian Prescriber|volume=20|pages=14–16|doi=10.18773/austprescr.1997.008|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activated charcoal is available without a prescription, so it is used for a variety of health-related applications. For example, it is often used to reduce discomfort and embarrassment due to excessive gas ([[flatulence]]) in the digestive tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treating flatulence|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Flatulence/Pages/Treatment.aspx|work=NHS|publisher=NHS UK|accessdate=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal charcoal or bone black is the carbonaceous [[residue (chemistry)|residue]] obtained by the dry distillation of bones. It contains only about 10% carbon, the remainder being calcium and [[magnesium]] phosphates (80%) and other inorganic material originally present in the bones. It is generally manufactured from the residues obtained in the [[Animal glue|glue]] and [[gelatin]] industries. Its decolorizing power was applied in 1812 by Derosne to the clarification of the [[syrup]]s obtained in [[sugar]] refining; but its use in this direction has now greatly diminished, owing to the introduction of more active and easily managed reagents. It is still used to some extent in [[laboratory]] practice. The decolorizing power is not permanent, becoming lost after using for some time; it may be revived, however, by washing and reheating. Wood charcoal also to some extent removes coloring material from solutions, but animal charcoal is generally more effective.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

[[Charcoal (art)|Charcoal]] is used in art for [[drawing]], making rough [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]] in [[painting]] and is one of the possible media for making a [[Surrealist techniques#Parsemage|parsemage]]. It must usually be preserved by the application of a [[Fixative (drawing)|fixative]]. Artists generally utilize charcoal in three forms:
* '''Vine charcoal''' is created by burning grape vines.
* '''Willow charcoal''' is created by burning sticks.
* '''Powdered charcoal''' is often used to "tone" or cover large sections of a drawing surface. Drawing over the toned areas darkens it further, but the artist can also lighten (or completely erase) within the toned area to create lighter tones.
* '''Compressed charcoal''' charcoal powder mixed with gum [[Binder (material)|binder]] compressed into round or square sticks. The amount of binder determines the hardness of the stick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=charcoal: powdered, compressed, willow and vine|url=http://museartanddesign.com/2011/09/charcoal-powdered-compressed-willow-and-vine/|work=Muse Art and Design|publisher=Muse Art and Design|accessdate=27 May 2012|date=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Compressed charcoal is used in charcoal [[pencil]]s.

===Horticulture===
{{main|Biochar}}
One additional use of charcoal was rediscovered recently in [[horticulture]]. Although American gardeners have been using charcoal for a short while, [[research]] on [[Terra preta]] [[soil]]s in the Amazon has found the widespread use of [[biochar]] by [[pre-Columbian]] natives to turn unproductive soil into carbon rich soil.

[[Red colobus]] monkeys in Africa have been observed eating charcoal for the purposes of self-medication. Their leafy diets contain high levels of [[cyanide]], which may lead to indigestion. So they learned to consume charcoal, which absorbs the cyanide and relieves indigestion. This knowledge about supplementing their diet is transmitted from mother to infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/clever-monkeys/monkeys-and-medicinal-plants/3957/ |title=Clever Monkeys: Monkeys and Medicinal Plants |publisher=PBS |date= 2011-09-13|accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charcoal has also been incorporated in [[toothpaste]] formulas; however, there is no evidence to determine its safety and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=John K.|last2=Bashirelahi|first2=Nasir|last3=Reynolds|first3=Mark A.|date=2017-06-07|title=Charcoal and charcoal-based dentifrices: A literature review|journal=Journal of the American Dental Association|volume=148|issue=9|pages=661–670|doi=10.1016/j.adaj.2017.05.001|issn=1943-4723|pmid=28599961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The last section of the film ''[[Le Quattro Volte]]'' (2010) gives a good and long, if poetic, documentation of the traditional method of making charcoal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1646975/ |title= Le quattro volte (2010) |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arthur Ransome]] children's series  ''[[Swallows and Amazons]]'' (particularly the second book, ''[[Swallowdale]]'') features carefully-drawn vignettes of the lives and the techniques of charcoal burners at the start of the 20th century, in the Lake District of the UK.

'''Dicyanamide''' is also known as '''dicyanamine'''.  The '''dicyanamide''' ion is a chemical having the [[chemical formula|formula]] {{chem|C|2|N|3|–}}. It contains two [[cyanide]] groups bound to a central nitrogen [[anion]]. The chemical is formed by decomposition of [[2-cyanoguanidine]]. It is used extensively as a counterion of organic and inorganic [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, and also as a reactant for the synthesis of various covalent organic structures.

Dicyanimide was used as an anionic component in an [[organic superconductor]] that was, when reported in 1990, a [[superconductor]] with the highest [[transition temperature]] in its structural class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/ic00339a004 |title= A new ambient-pressure organic superconductor, κ-(ET)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu[N(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]Br, with the highest transition temperature yet observed (inductive onset ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;= 11.6 K, resistive onset = 12.5 K) |first1= Aravinda M. |last1= Kini |first2= Urs |last2= Geiser |first3= Hau H. |last3= Wang |first4= K.

In [[aviation]], a '''drop tank''' ('''external tank''', '''wing tank''', or '''belly tank''') is used to describe auxiliary [[fuel tank]]s externally carried by [[aircraft]]. A drop tank is expendable and often jettisonable. External tanks are commonplace on modern [[military aircraft]] and occasionally found in [[civilian]] ones, although the latter are less likely to be discarded except in the event of emergency.

==Overview==
{{anchor|Aeronautic}}
[[File:US Navy 100525-N-6003P-076 Aviation Ordnancemen 3rd Class Eric Johnson and Robert Latner complete a 364-day inspection of an F-A-18C Hornet in the hangar bay of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75).jpg|thumb|right|Drop tank storage aboard {{USS|Harry S. Truman|CVN-75}}]]

The primary disadvantage with drop tanks is that they impose a drag penalty on the aircraft carrying them. External fuel tanks will also increase the [[moment of inertia]], thereby reducing [[Flight dynamics|roll rates]] for [[Air combat manoeuvring|air maneuvres]]. Some of the drop tank's fuel is used to overcome the added drag and weight of the tank itself. Drag in this sense varies with the square of the aircraft's speed. The use of drop tanks also reduces the number of external [[hardpoint]]s available for [[weapon]]s, reduces the weapon-carrying capacity, and increases the aircraft's [[radar signature]].

Usually the fuel in the drop tanks is consumed first, and only when all the fuel in the drop tanks has been used, the fuel selector is switched to the airplane's internal tanks.

Some modern combat aircraft use [[conformal fuel tank]]s (CFTs) instead of or in addition to conventional external fuel tanks. CFTs produce less drag and do not take up external hardpoints; however, some versions can only be removed on the ground.

==History==
[[File:Истребитель Heinkel He-51B.jpg|thumb|Bulgarian Heinkel He-51B, with drop tank under fuselage]]
[[File:Messerschmitt Bf 109 drop tank Keski-Suomen ilmailumuseo.JPG|thumb|right|A standard 300 litre capacity drop tank of the German WW II Luftwaffe]]
[[File:Me110.jpg|thumb|right|A Bf 110 of 9./[[ZG 26]] with the rarely used, fin-stabilized 900 litre drop tanks]]

The drop tank was used during the [[Spanish Civil War]] to allow [[fighter aircraft]] to carry additional fuel for long-range escort flights without requiring a dramatically larger, heavier, less maneuverable [[fuselage]].  During [[World War II]], the German [[Luftwaffe]] began using external fuel tanks with the introduction of a 300-liter (80 US gallon) light alloy model for the [[Junkers Ju 87#Ju 87B|Ju 87R]], a long-range version of the ''Stuka'' [[dive bomber]], in early 1940. The [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighter also used this type of drop tank, starting with the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109E-7]] variant introduced in August 1940. Fitted also to the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]], the 300 liter tank, available in at least four differing construction formats — including at least one impregnated paper material, single-use version — and varying only slightly in appearance, became the standard volume for most subsequent drop tanks in Luftwaffe service, with a rarely used 900 litre (238 U.S. gallon), fin-stabilized large capacity drop tank used with some marks of the [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] heavy fighter and other twin-engined Luftwaffe combat aircraft.

The first drop tanks were designed to be discarded when empty or in the event of combat or emergency in order to reduce [[Drag (physics)|drag]], weight, and to increase maneuverability. Modern external tanks may be retained in combat, to be dropped in an emergency.

The Allies commonly used them to allow fighters increased range and patrol time over continental Europe. The RAF used such external fuel tanks in 1942, during the transit of [[Supermarine Spitfires]] to [[Malta]].

[[File:RabaulTainanZeros.jpg|thumb|A6M3 Model 22, flown by Japanese top ace Hiroyoshi Nishizawa over the Solomon Islands, 1943]]

The Imperial Japanese navy design specification for what came to be the Japanese [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighter, included endurance with drop tanks of two hours at full power, or six to eight hours at cruising speed. Drop tanks were commonly used with the Zero, even on [[Combat Air Patrol]] (CAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The First Team: Pacific Naval Air Combat from Pearl Harbor to Midway|last=Lundstrom|first=John B.|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zero entered service in 1940.

Bomber theorists insisted formations of heavy bombers with elaborate defensive armaments would be self-defending, believing long-range escort fighters to be "a myth"&lt;ref name="w"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Stephen Peter|title=Winning the next war: Innovation and the modern military|year=1994|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y|isbn=0-8014-8196-1|pages=173–177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncLRUf-q-XYC&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;f=false|edition=5th printing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they could be easily forced to drop the tanks by minor harassment at the beginning of the raid&lt;ref name="w"/&gt; being more concerned that long-range medium bombers might compete for resources and so compromise their goal of creating vast fleets of [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dragon's Teeth?: The Creation of United States Air Power for World War II|last=Kelsey|first=Benjamin S.|year=1982|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|isbn=0-87474-574-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sq64AAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of such entrenched attitudes in 1941 airmen such as [[Benjamin S. Kelsey]] and [[Oliver P. Echols]] worked quietly to get drop tank technology added to American fighters such as the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]].

It was only with drop tanks supplying {{convert|450|gal}} of extra fuel per fighter that P-38s could carry out [[Operation Vengeance]], the downing of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s airplane. (For this mission, each fighter carried one drop tank of approximately {{convert|150|to|165|gal|abbr=on|L}}, and a larger one of approximately {{convert|300|to|330|gal|abbr=on|L}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Air Power History|volume=50|publisher=Air Force Historical Foundation|year=2003|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6z7quhWS-BoC&amp;pg=PA308|pages=308|first=Norman|last=Polmar|title=Aircraft Carriers: A History of Carrier Aviation and Its Influence on World Events, Volume II: 1946-2006|publisher=Potomac Books|year=2008|isbn=1574886657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after such experience showed the necessity for drop tanks, inflexible thinkers such as [[8th Air Force]] General [[Ira C. Eaker]] had to be transferred out of commanding positions (and replaced with Maj. Gen. [[Jimmy Doolittle]]) so that drop tanks and range extension plans could be widely implemented in 1944 for American [[escort fighter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lockheed P-38 Lightning|last=Bodie|first=Warren M.|year=1991|publisher=Widewing Publications|isbn=0-9629359-5-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KzHpAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

External drop tanks turned the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] from a short-range [[interceptor aircraft]] into a long-range escort and [[air superiority fighter]], enabling it to accompany bombers from British Isles into Germany, and made it possible for heavy bomber formations to undertake daylight raids under escort by [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s.

The P-38 could also carry two 300-to-330-gallon drop tanks for its longest sorties. This teardrop-shaped tank design was {{convert|13|ft}} long and {{convert|3|ft}} in diameter at its widest point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uFVqaS_QjW4C&amp;pg=PA97|page=97|title=Man And Machine: The Best of Stephan Wilkinson|first=Stephan|last=Wilkinson|publisher=Globe Pequot|year=2005|isbn=1599216795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paper-based drop tanks===
[[File:Jettison Petrol Tanks- the Production of Jettison Tanks For USE by the United States Army Air Force and Royal Air Force, Britain, 1944 D23460.jpg|thumb|right|110 US-gallon (416 litre) paper drop tanks, destined for USAAF and RAF use, being manufactured at a British factory (1944)]]

[[File:359th_Fighter_Group_-_External_Fuel_Tanks.jpg|thumb|right|Paper droptanks stockpiled for use by the [[359th Fighter Group]], [[RAF East Wretham]], 1944]]

Faced by wartime metal shortages and a need to extend the range of fighter craft, the British came up with drop tanks made of glue-impregnated [[kraft paper]], which had excellent tolerance characteristics for extreme heat and cold necessary for operation on an aircraft as well as being waterproof.

Since the glue would slowly dissolve from the solvent effects of the fuel (sometimes developing leaks within a few hours of being loaded with fuel) these were strictly a single-use item, used in typically chilly Northern European conditions, filled immediately before take off, jettisoned in the event of an aborted mission and only being required for the outbound portion of any flight.

Such [[papier-mâché]] tanks were assembled from three main components, the nose cone, tail cone and the body, each shaped over wooden forms, the centre section created by wrapping layers of the impregnated paper around a cylinder, the end caps hand-laminated with [[Gore (segment)|petal-shaped pieces sometimes named gores]].

Before final assembly wooden anti-[[Slosh dynamics|slosh]] baffles were installed, pipes and fittings were attached and the interiors coated with fuel-resistant lacquer and the three pieces were bonded together in press. Once the tank had cured, it was pressure tested to 6 PSI and passing tanks were given two coats of cellulose dope followed by two coats of aluminium paint. (British drop tanks can be distinguished from outwardly similar metal tanks by colour, paper tanks were silver in appearance, while metal tanks were grey.&lt;ref name="WarbirdNews2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warbirdsnews.com/warbird-articles/necessity-mother-invention-paper-drop-tanks-wwii.html|title=Necessity is the Mother of Invention: Paper Drop Tanks of WWII|publisher=Warbird News|date=13 August 2013|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 13,000 papier-mâché tanks were made and used by the RAF, the vast majority used in the course of the war, conserving a considerable amount of metal. Very few examples survive due to their expendable nature and low intrinsic value at the time of their creation, and the fact that they are not inherently robust.&lt;ref name="WarbirdNews2013"/&gt; While probably a nuisance for those under the flight path when the empty tanks were released, as they were lightweight and comparatively fragile it is unlikely to cause anything but anxiety, the Germans authorities going so far as to distribute leaflets, explaining that drop tanks are not bombs.&lt;ref name="WarbirdNews2013"/&gt;

[[File:P-51 Mustang droptanks (7326241066).jpg|thumb|right|110-gallon paper, and 75-gallon metal drop tanks displayed at the ''Luchtoorlogsmuseum'', an aviation museum in the Netherlands (2012)]]
U.S. paper tanks were developed by Col. Bob Shafer and Col. Cass Hough, who spent many hours developing a 110-gallon (416 litre) paper tank, then getting them into series production at Bowater-Lloyd's of London, only to be told by experts at [[Wilbur Wright Field|Wright Field]] "paper tanks are absolutely unfeasible and will not do the job for which they are intended". Since by the time the experts made that pronouncement 8th Air Force fighters had already used more than 15,000 paper tanks without a failure, the criticism was not taken seriously.

However it may explain why the most often-used fuel tanks for single-engined American fighters operating in Northern Europe were the 75-gallon (284 litre) capacity all-metal tank (made from two halves of formed aluminium with a prominent horizontal seam running along the tank's midline). Another common metal drop tank was the 150-to-165-gallon model used by P-51s, P-47s and P-38s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pib4YDfV-joC&amp;pg=PA66|page=66|title=So-Cal Speed Shop: The Fast Tale of the California Racers Who Made Hot Rod History|publisher=MotorBooks International|year=2005|first1=Mark|last1=Christensen|first2=Tony|last2=Thacker|isbn=1610591852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, [[hot rod]]ders raced the [[dry lake]]s of California to set new land speed records. War surplus drop tanks were plentiful and aerodynamically neutral, and it didn't take long to make one into a car, dubbed a [[lakester]]. According to GM historians,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supercars.net/cars/2520.html 2003 So-Cal Lakester]&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Burke of the [[So-Cal Speed Shop]] first attempted to convert a 168-gallon P-51 Mustang belly tank, before switching to the larger 305-gallon P-38 Lightning tank. Even now, lakesters compete at the Bonneville Salt Flats.

The ''' Electro-Dynamic Light Company ''' of New York was a lighting and electrical distribution company organized in 1878. The company held the patents for the first practical system of incandescent electric lighting. It was the first company formally established to provided electric lightning and was the first company organized specifically to manufacture and sell [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent electric light bulbs]]. 

== History ==

[[Albon Man]], a New York attorney, and [[William E. Sawyer]], an electrical engineer, officially formed the Electro-Dynamic Light Company of New York on July 8, 1878.&lt;ref name=officially&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Sawyer's Electric Lamp |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5075079// |newspaper=Fort Wayne Weekly Sentinel  |location=Fort Wayne, Indiana |date=November 13, 1878 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|EE1890|1890|p=72}}{{sfn|Pope|1894|p=10}}

The Electro-Dynamic Light Company was the first organized specifically to manufacture and sell incandescent electric light bulbs. Man and Sawyer patented the first practical system of incandescent electric lighting and gave the patents to the company. The United States Electric Lighting Company was organized in 1878, weeks after the Electro-Dynamic Company.{{sfn|EE1890|1890|p=72}}{{sfn|WE1890|1890|p=36}}{{sfn|ER1890|1890|p=9}}

[[File:Sawyer electric lamp 205144.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Electric lamp patented 1878]]
In 1878, the Electro-Dynamic Light Company demonstrated an electric light that was the invention of Sawyer and Man. An exhibition was set up in New York City on October 29, 1878.&lt;ref name=ChicagoTrib&gt; {{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Electro-Dynamic Light Company ready to Commence Operation  |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5121139// |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |location=Chicago, Illinois |date=November 1, 1878 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }} &lt;/ref&gt; The same exhibition was mentioned several weeks later in a newspaper of Princeton, Minnesota,&lt;ref name=yesterday&gt; {{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=A New Electric Light |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5119971// |newspaper= The Princeton Union|location=Princeton, Minnesota |date=November 13, 1878 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }} &lt;/ref&gt; and Bismarck, North Dakota.&lt;ref name=Bismarck&gt; {{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=A New Electric Light |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5120096// |newspaper=Bismarck |location=Bismarck, North Dakota |date=November 18, 1878 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }} &lt;/ref&gt; The lamp was described as a strip of pencil [[graphite|carbon graphite]] connected with two wires to an electric generator. The carbon strip was in a [[hermetically sealed]] glass bulb that was filled with [[nitrogen]] gas. When electricity was applied, the internal strip developed a temperature of between 30,000 and 50,000 degrees [[Fahrenheit]]. Since there was no oxygen in the glass globe the carbon filament did not burn out and produced light instead.&lt;ref name=Electro-Dynami&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= A New Electric Light / The Electro-Dynamic Light Company / Ready to Commence Operations |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5045915// |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York City |date= October 30, 1878 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demonstration consisted of five electric light bulbs hanging from [[chandelier]]s in an office building at the corner of Elm and Walker Streets. Wires came from the electric lights and went to an adjacent room where there was a generator set up to produce electricity. The wires passed through keyholes to the adjoining room. A key was put into the keyhole and turned to switch on the electric current. As the key was turned further around, the electric lights got brighter. This switch idea was demonstrated with all five chandeliers with the electric lamps. An electric meter to measure the amount of electricity used in an office or house for billing purposes was also demonstrated.&lt;ref name=1878lamp/&gt;

[[Thomas Edison]]'s electric lighting discoveries were first shown in September 1878. The Edison Electric-Light Company of New York was organized on October 17, three months after the Electro-Dynamic Company was formally established.{{sfn|NAR1889|1889|p=654}} The United States Electric-Lighting Company of New York was formed shortly after this to introduce the inventions of [[Hiram S.

'''Erle Palmer Halliburton''' (September 22, 1892, near [[Henning, Tennessee|Henning]], [[Tennessee]] – October 13, 1957, in [[Los Angeles]]) was an American businessman specializing in the oil business.

==Early life==
Halliburton was born in Henning, Tennessee, on September 22, 1892. When Halliburton was 12 years old, his father died. At 14, Halliburton left home to support the family. As a youth, he learned how to operate heavy machinery such as a train locomotive, a steam crane and a steam shovel. Later, Halliburton was a salesman in New York.

==Business career==
Prior to the [[United States]]'s entry into [[World War I]], Halliburton gained exposure to shipboard engineering as a member of the [[United States Navy]]. After his [[honorable discharge]] in 1915, he headed for the oilfields of [[California]], where he was able to apply techniques analogous to the technology with which he had worked in the Navy. His drive and his sense of innovation soon brought him into conflict with his boss, Almond Perkins. Halliburton later quipped that getting hired and getting fired by the Perkins Oil Well Cementing Company were the two best opportunities he had ever received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halliburton then moved to [[Duncan, Oklahoma]] where Halliburton invented, perfected, and patented a new method of oil well cementing. According to one of the inscriptions on the pictured monument, Halliburton's method "isolates the various downhole zones, guards against collapse of the casing and permits control of the well during its producing life." In 1919, based on this new method, Halliburton started Duncan's [[Halliburton|New Method Oil Well Cementing Company]]. By 1922, the company was operating as the Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Company. On July 5, 1961, it became known as the [[Halliburton Company]].

Halliburton also designed the aluminum suitcases which are now manufactured by [[Zero Halliburton]].
[[File:Erlehalli.jpg|thumbnail|upright|"An Uncommon Man;" Erle P. Halliburton Monument in Memorial Park, [[Duncan, OK]]; erected – 1993]]

Halliburton was inducted into the [[Oklahoma Hall of Fame]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oklahomaheritage.com/HallofFame/ByName/tabid/89/Default.aspx | title=Oklahoma Hall of Fame | accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Private life ==
Halliburton was married to Vida C. Taber Halliburton, but had a few children out of wedlock. Edith Edna Cole, an office employee at the Duncan headquarters gave birth to Carl Thurlo in 1933 after an extensive affair with Erle. Carl is one of a few extramarital children, including Edith's grand daughter, Shirley Kaye, born in 1941, to Memory, oldest daughter of Edith. Memory was 14 at the time of the affair. Memory settled a paternity and support lawsuit in Los Angeles in the 1940's.  Shirley Kaye received a cash settlement in 1968. Another child, Billie Jean Thurlo, born in 1930, is said to also be a daughter of Edith Edna Cole and Erle P. Halliburton. Edith Edna Cole was married to MM Bloomfield, Perry Eaton and William Graham. There is a record of Edith Edna Cole being married to William "Bill" Thurlo, but there are no birth certificates for Billie Jean and Carl.  Edith Edna Cole Bloomfield Thurlo's children; Memory, Inez, Joe Ben, Billie Jean, Carl and Marshal, were born in Duncan, OK. between 1918 and 1941. 

In 1941, Halliburton provided cash for an 80 acre plot of land for Edith Edna Cole and her children near Kingston, OK along the shores of Lake Texoma. Halliburton planned a resort with cabin cruiser boat themed cabins as guest units at Lake Texoma, but it was never built. Halliburton visited Edith and the children in Kingston a few times in the 1940's before Memory moved Shirley to Dayton, OH. Edna married Perry Eaton in 1940 and had two sons with him; James Lee Eaton and Earl P. Eaton. Eaton adopted the older children. Eaton farmed the land and took care of the children in Kingston while Edith worked in Oklahoma City in the aircraft industry during WWII. &lt;ref&gt;Interviews with Carl Thurlo and Billie Jean Thurlo Valentine, Ancestry.com&lt;ref&gt;

'''Fibrillogenesis''' is the development of fine [[fibril]]s normally present in [[collagen]] fibers of [[connective tissue]]. It is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''fibrillo'' (meaning fibrils, or pertaining to fibrils) and ''genesis'' (to create, the process by which something is created).

The assembly of [[collagen]] fibrils, fibrillogenesis appears to be a self-assembly process although there is much speculation about the specifics of the mechanism through which the body produces collagen fibrils.&lt;ref name="pmid18640274"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kader|first=Karl|title=Collagen fibrillogenesis: fibronectin, integrins, and minor collagens as organizers and nucleators|journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology|volume=20|issue=5–24|pages=495–501|pmc=2577133|year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2008.06.008|pmid=18640274}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the body, collagen fibrils are composed of several types of collagen as well as macromolecules. Collagen I is the most abundant structural macromolecule within the vertebrate body and also represents the most abundant collagen found within various collagen fibrils&lt;ref name="pmid12869566"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hansen|first=Uwe|author2=Peter Bruckner |title=Macromolecular Specificity of Collagen Fibrillogenesis FIBRILS OF COLLAGENS I AND XI CONTAIN A HETEROTYPIC ALLOYED CORE AND A COLLAGEN I SHEATH|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=July 2003|volume=278|issue=39|page=|pages=37352–37359|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/278/39/37352.full.pdf+html|pmid=12869566|doi=10.1074/jbc.M304325200}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are immense differences in the types of collagen fibrils that exist within the body. For instance, fibrils within the tendon vary in width and are banded into aggregates that form fibril bundles that resist forces of tension within one dimension. Similarly, fibrils that form the translucent corneal stromal matrix form orthogonal sheets and withstand the force of traction in two dimensions. Remarkably, these two structurally different collagen fibrils are speculated to be formed from the same molecules with Collagen I being the primary collagen found within both structures.&lt;ref name="pmid12869566"/&gt;

== Synthesis ==

There is no concrete evidence or agreement on the exact mechanisms of Fibrillogenesis, however, multiple hypotheses based on primary research put forth various mechanisms to consider.  Collagen fibrillogenesis occurs in the plasma membrane during embryonic development. Collagen within the body has a denaturation temperature between 32-40 degrees Celsius, the physiological temperature also falls within this range and thereby poses a significant problem.&lt;ref name="pmid1069288"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trelstad|first=Robert|author2=Kimiko Hayashi |author3=Jerome Gross |title=Collagen fibrillogenesis: Intermediate aggregates and suprafibrillar order|journal=Cell Biology|date=July 19, 1976|volume=73|issue=11|page=|pages=4027–4031|bibcode=1976PNAS...73.4027T|doi=10.1073/pnas.73.11.4027|pmid=1069288|pmc=431312}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore a mystery how collagen survives within the tissues in order to yield itself to the formation of collagen fibrils. A postulated solution to the problem of denaturation based on current research, is that newly formed collagen gets stored in vacuoles. The storage vacuoles also contain molecular aggregates that provide the required thermal stability to allow for fibrillogenesis to occur within the body.&lt;ref name="pmid1069288"/&gt; In the body, fibrillar collagens have over 50 known binding partners.&lt;ref name="pmid18640274"/&gt; The cell accounts for the variety of binding partners through the localization of the fibrillogenesis process to the plasma membrane in order to maintain control of which molecules bind to each other and further ensure both fibril diversity and assemblies of certain collagen fibrils in different tissues &lt;ref name="pmid18640274"/&gt; Kader, Hill, and Canty-Larid published a plausible mechanism for the formation of collagen fibrils. [[Fibronectin]] a glycoprotein that binds to receptor proteins known as [[integrins]] within the cytoskeleton is a key player in the hypothesized method of fibrillogenesis. The interaction between fibronectin and the integrin receptor causes a conformational change in the fibronectin. Additional receptors bind to fibronectin bringing in Collagen I, procollagen I and collagen V. These molecules interact with fibronectin to promote fibril formation on the surface of the cell.&lt;ref name="pmid18640274"/&gt;

== Regulation ==
Based on research done using Mice and studies of [[Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome]] (EDS), which is characterized by hypermobility of the joints and high levels of skin laxtivity, researcher found that [[Tenascin-X]] expression levels correlated with the number of present collagen fibrils. In humans, Tenasin-X is associated with EDS. Through their research, researcher confounded the original hypothesis that tenasin-x interfered with collagen fibrillogenesis and suggest that it acts rather as a regulator of collagen fibrillogenesis. Data suggest tenasin-x is a regulator of collagen fibril spacing. In vitro tests yield evidence  that suggest tenasin-x accelerates collagen fibril formation through an additive mechanism when collagen VI is present.&lt;ref name="pmid18640274"/&gt; In addition to tenasin-x, multiple proteins, glycoconjugates, and small molecules  have shown to influence not only the rate of collagen fibrillogenesis, but also the structure of collagen fibrils as well as their size in lab studies.

== Medical Significance ==
A better understanding of the mechanisms of collagen fibrillogenesis as well as an understanding of the regulators of the process would allow for a better understanding of diseases that affect collagen fibril formation and assembly such as [[Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome]] (EDS). On a broader spectrum, an understanding of the processes that lie behind fibrillogenesis would allow for great advancements in the field of regenerative medicine. A greater understanding would lead to a potential future in which organs and tissue damaged through trauma could be regenerated using the basis of collagen fibrillogenesis.

'''''Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence''''' is an Australian book by [[Doris Pilkington Garimara|Doris Pilkington]], published in 1996. Based on a true story, the book is a personal account of an [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous Australian]] family's experiences as members of the [[Stolen Generation]] &amp;ndash; the forced removal of mixed-race children from their families during the early 20th century. It tells the story of three young [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] girls: [[Molly Kelly (Australian Aboriginal Icon)|Molly]] (the author's mother), [[Daisy Kadibil|Daisy]] (Molly's half-sister), and Gracie (their cousin), who are forcibly removed from their families at [[Jigalong]] and taken to [[Moore River Native Settlement|Moore River]], but escape from the government settlement in 1931, and then trek over {{convert|1,600|km}} home by following the [[rabbit-proof fence]], a massive [[pest-exclusion fence]] which crossed [[Western Australia]] from north to south.

The book was adapted as a film, ''[[Rabbit-Proof Fence (film)|Rabbit-Proof Fence]]'', in 2002.

==Publication==
Doris Pilkington had spent much of her early life from the age of four at the [[Moore River Native Settlement]] in [[Western Australia]], the same facility the book chronicles her mother, aunt's and cousin's escape from as children. After reuniting with her family, Pilkington says she did not talk to her mother much, and she was not aware of her mother's captivity at Moore River nor the story of her escape, until her [[Daisy Kadibil|Aunt Daisy]] told her the story. Repeating the story at an Aboriginal family history event in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], one of the attendees told Pilkington he was aware of the story and that the case was fairly well-documented. He gave her some documents and clippings which formed the factual backbone of the story on which Pilkington based a first draft.&lt;ref name="quin"&gt;{{cite news|author= Quin, Karl| url= http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/resources/film/sunage17feb02.html |title=Molly's Story| work=[[The Age|The Sunday Age]]|date= 17 February 2002| accessdate= 6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilkington submitted the draft to a publisher in 1985 but was told it was too much like an academic paper and that she should try her hand at writing fiction. Her first novel, ''Caprice, A Stockman's Daughter'', won the [[David Unaipon]] Literary Award and was published in 1990 by the [[University of Queensland|University of Queensland Press]]. Pilkington then rewrote and filled out ''Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence'' following several years of interviewing her mother and aunt, and it was published in 1996.&lt;ref name="quin" /&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Rabbit proof fence map showing route.PNG|thumb|150px|Map of the actual Rabbit-proof fence showing the trip from [[Moore River Native Settlement|Moore River]] to [[Jigalong]].]]
Molly, her half-sister Daisy and their cousin Gracie are taken to Moore River for schooling to become more like a white person and to eventually be taken to a (more) rural part of Western Australia. The girls escaped from the Settlement and took the 1,600km walk home.&lt;ref&gt;Matheo, Demetrios: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4728661/The-long-walk-home.html The long walk home], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 1 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
{{main|Rabbit-Proof Fence (film)}}
Shortly after the book's publication, the film rights were obtained by scriptwriter Christine Olsen, who wrote the script and was persistent in her pitching of the film to [[Hollywood]]-based Australian director [[Phillip Noyce]]. Noyce agreed to direct the film, which was released in 2002 and starred [[Everlyn Sampi]] as Molly, and British actor [[Kenneth Branagh]] as [[A. O. Neville]], the [[Protector of Aborigines|Chief Protector of Aborigines]].

The '''Krasnoyarsk Dam''' is a {{convert|124|m|ft|0|adj=on}} high [[concrete]] [[gravity dam]] located on the [[Yenisey River]] about {{convert|30|km|mi|0}} upstream from [[Krasnoyarsk]] in [[Divnogorsk]], [[Russia]]. It was constructed from 1956 to 1972, and it supplies about 6,000 MW (six GW) of power, mostly used to supply the KrAZ (Krasnoyarsky Aluminievyy Zavod, the Krasnoyarsk Aluminum Plant). Both power and [[aluminum]] plants are controlled by the [[Rusal|RUSAL company]].

[[File:Banknote 10 rubles 2004 back.jpg|left|thumb|Krasnoyarsk Dam on the [[Russian ruble#Seventh ruble 2|Russian 10-ruble]] banknote.]]
Beginning with the opening of the 10th turbine in April 1971, the powerhouse was the world’s single largest [[power plant]] until the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] reached 6,181&amp;nbsp;MW in 1983. The Krasnoyarsk Dam is held to be a landmark symbol of Krasnoyarsk, and it is depicted on the [[Russian ruble#Seventh ruble 2|10-ruble banknote]].

As a result of the damming, the [[Krasnoyarsk Reservoir]] was created. This reservoir, informally known as the Krasnoyarsk Sea, has an area of {{convert|2000|km2|sqmi|-1}} and a volume of {{convert|73.3|km3|cumi|0}}. It is {{convert|388|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|15|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in width at its widest, has an average depth of {{convert|36.6|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}, and a depth of {{convert|105|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} near the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Krasnoyarkkoye Reservoir |url=http://www.ilec.or.jp/database/asi/asi-56.html |publisher=International Lake Environment Committee |accessdate=24 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723191324/http://www.ilec.or.jp/database/asi/asi-56.html |archivedate=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Krasnoyarsk Dam significantly influences the local climate; normally the river would freeze over in the bitterly-cold [[Siberia|Siberian]] [[winter]], but because the dam releases unfrozen water year-round, the river never freezes in the {{convert|200|km|mi}} to {{convert|300|km|mi}} stretch of river immediately downstream from the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Grigor'ev|first1= Yu.

==Description==
The plant is variable due to extensive breeding in cultivation, but in general, they are annual or short-lived perennial [[vine]]s. The wild species is perennial. The thick stems can reach six meters in length. The leaves are made up of three pointed leaflets each up to 15 centimeters long. They may be hairy on the undersides. The [[inflorescence]] is made up of [[raceme]]s of many flowers. Some [[cultivar]]s have white flowers, and others may have purplish or blue.&lt;ref name=tf/&gt; The fruit is a [[legume]] pod variable in shape, size, and color. It is usually several centimeters long and bright purple to pale green.&lt;ref name=fl&gt;[http://www.floridata.com/ref/D/doli_lab.cfm ''Dolichos lablab''.] Floridata.&lt;/ref&gt; It contains up to four seeds. The seeds are white, brown, red, or black depending on the cultivar, sometimes with a white hilum. Wild plants have mottled seeds. The seed is about a centimeter long.&lt;ref name=tf/&gt;

==Uses==
The hyacinth bean is an old domesticated pulse and multi-purpose crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smartt |first1=John |year=1985 |title= Evolution of grain legumes. II.

The fruit and beans are edible if boiled well with several changes of the water.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; Otherwise, they are toxic due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides, [[glycoside]]s that are converted to [[hydrogen cyanide]] when consumed. Signs of poisoning include weakness, vomiting, [[dyspnea]], twitching, [[stupor]], and [[convulsion]]s.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; It has been shown that there is a wide range of cyanogenic potential among the varieties.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal | last1=Guretzki |first1=Sebastian | last2=Papenbrock |first2=Jutta |year=2014 |title= Characterization of ''Lablab purpureus'' Regarding drought tolerance, trypsin inhibitor activity and cyanogenic potential for selection in breeding programmes |journal=Journal of Agronomy and Crop Science |volume=200 |issue=1 |pages=24–35 |doi=10.1111/jac.12043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaves are eaten raw or cooked like [[spinach]].&lt;ref name=PROTA/&gt; The flowers can be eaten raw or steamed. The root can be boiled or baked for food. The seeds are used to make [[tofu]] and [[tempeh]].&lt;ref name=fl/&gt;

In [[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]], the green pods along with the beans, known as ''Sheem'' (শিম), are cooked as vegetables or cooked with fish as a curry.

In [[Kerala]], it is known as ''Amarakka, Avara'' or ''Amara Payar'' ([[Malayalam]]: അമര പയർ ).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://papanasini.blogspot.com/2014/01/amara-payar.html|title=papanasini: AMARA PAYAR ( അമര പയർ )|last=Nair|first=Manu|date=2014-01-01|website=papanasini|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beans as well as the bean pods are used in cooking curries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://secretindianrecipe.com/recipe/amarapayar-curry-snowpeas-curry|title=Amarapayar Curry (Snowpeas Curry)|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bean pods are also used (along with spices) for preparing stir-fried dish known as ''Thoran''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nammuderuchikal.com/amara-thoran/|title=Amara Thoran|work=Nammude Ruchikal|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Maharashtra]], dry preparations with green masala is often made out of these green beans (Ghevda varirties - Shravan ghevda (french beans), Bajirao Ghevda, Ghevda, Walwar, Pavta sheng..) mostly found at the end of monsoon during fasting festivals of [[Shravan]] month.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} 

In [[Karnataka]], the hyacinth bean is made into curry (''avarekalu saaru'')({{lang-kn|ಅವರೆಕಾಳು ಸಾರು}}), salad (''avarekaalu usli''), added to upma (''avrekaalu [[uppittu]]''), and as a flavoring to [[Akki rotti]]. Sometimes the outer peel of the seed is taken out and the inner soft part is used for a variety of dishes. This form is called ''hitakubele avarekalu'', which means "pressed (''hitaku'') hyancinth bean, and a curry known as ''Hitikida Avarekaalu Saaru'' is made out of this deskinned beans.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} 

In [[Telangana]] and [[Andhra Pradesh|Andra Pradesh]], the bean pods are cut into small pieces and cooked as spicy curry in [[Pongal]] festival season. Sometimes the outer peel of the seed when tender and soaked over night is taken out and the inner soft part is used for a variety of dishes. This form is called ''pitakapappu,hanupa/anapa'', which means "pressed (''pitaku'') hyancinth bean, and a curry known as Pitikida Anapaginjala Chaaru is made out of this deskinned beans along with [[Pearl millet|''bajra'']] bread; it has been a very special delicacy for centuries.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

and 
* ''Lablab purpureus'' subsp. ''purpureus''

in addition to one wild subspecies: 
* ''Lablab purpureus'' subsp. ''uncinatus''
of which a special variant with lobed leaflets exists only in Namibia: 
* ''Lablab purpureus'' var. ''rhomboïdeus'' (Schinz).

{{Continuum mechanics}}
In [[continuum physics]], '''materials with memory''', also referred as '''materials with hereditary effects''' are a class of materials whose [[constitutive equation]]s contains a dependence upon the past history of [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]], [[Kinetics (physics)|kinetic]], [[electromagnetic]] or other kind of [[state variable]]s.

==Historical notes==
The study of these materials arises from the pioneering articles of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Boltzmann|1874}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Boltzmann|1878}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vito Volterra]],&lt;ref name="Vol1912"&gt;{{harv|Volterra|1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Func1930"&gt;([[#{{harvid|Volterra|1959}}|Volterra 1930]]).&lt;/ref&gt; in which they sought an extension of the concept of an [[Cauchy elastic material|elastic material]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Coleman|Noll|1961|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key assumption of their theory was that the local stress value at a time {{mvar|t}} depends upon the history of the local deformation up to {{mvar|t}}. In general, in materials with memory the local value of some constitutive quantity (stress, heat flux, electric current, polarization and magnetization, etc.) at a time {{mvar|t}} depends upon the history of the state variables (deformation, temperature, electric and magnetic fields, etc.). The hypothesis that the remote history of a variable has less influence than its values in the recent past, was stated in modern continuum mechanics as the [[fading memory principle]] by [[Bernard Coleman]] and [[Walter Noll]].
This assumption was implicit in the pioneer works: when restricted to cyclic hystories, it traces back to the closed cycle principle stated by Volterra,&lt;ref name="Func1930" /&gt; which leds to a constitutive relation of integral convolution type.
In the linear case, this relation takes the form of a Volterra equation

===Constitutive relations of materials with memory===
In the linear case, this relation takes the form of a [[Volterra equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{T}(\boldsymbol{x},t)=\boldsymbol{G}_0(\boldsymbol{x})\boldsymbol{E}(\boldsymbol{x},t)+\int_0^{+\infty}\!\!\!\!\boldsymbol{G}^\prime(\boldsymbol{x},s)\boldsymbol{E}(\boldsymbol{x},t-s)\mathrm{d}s&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Bengalpresidency 1858.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The vast extent of the [[Bengal Presidency]] (shown here in 1858) facilitated the adoption of the standard of 100&amp;nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|Troy pounds]] for the maund throughout [[British India]].]]
The '''maund''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔː|n|d}} is the anglicized name for a traditional [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[mass]] used in [[British India]], and also in [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]:&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{citation | contribution = maund | title = [[Oxford English Dictionary|A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles]] | volume = 6B | year = 1908 | page = 250}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the same unit in the [[Moghul Empire]] was sometimes written as '''''mann''''' or '''''mun''''' in English, while the equivalent unit in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Central Asia]] was called the ''[[batman (unit)|batman]]''. At different times, and in different South Asian localities, the mass of the maund has varied, from as low as 25&amp;nbsp;pounds (11&amp;nbsp;kg) to as high as 160&amp;nbsp;pounds (72½&amp;nbsp;kg): even greater variation is seen in Persia and Arabia.&lt;ref name="Prinsep"&gt;{{citation | last = Prinsep | first = James | year = 1840 | title = Useful tables, forming an appendix to the Journal of the Asiatic Society: part the first, Coins, weights, and measures of British India | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LTYGAAAAQAAJ | edition = 2nd | location = Calcutta | publisher = Bishop's College Press | pages = 84–90}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doursther"&gt;{{citation | last = Doursther | first = Horace | title = Dictionnaire universel des poids et mesures anciens et modernes | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KAibOR651tkC | location = Brussels | publisher = Hayez | year = 1840 | pages = 259–63}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In British India, the maund was first standardized in the [[Bengal Presidency]] in 1833, where it was set equal to 100&amp;nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|Troy pounds]] (82.28&amp;nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lbs.]] [[Avoirdupois|av.]]). This standard spread throughout the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name="ImpGaz"&gt;{{citation | contribution = Introductory notes | contribution-url = http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V02_007.gif | year = 1909 | title = [[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]] | volume = 1 | page= xi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the independence of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], the definition formed the basis for [[metrication]], one maund becoming '''exactly 37.3242&amp;nbsp;[[kilograms]]'''.&lt;ref name="sizes.com"&gt;{{citation | title = maund | url = http://www.sizes.com/units/maund.htm | publisher = Sizes.com | accessdate = 2010-02-12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schedule 1 to the Standard Weights and Measures Act (No.&amp;nbsp;89 of 1956).&lt;/ref&gt; A similar metric definition is used in [[Nepal]]. In its southern plains one Mann equals 40 Kilograms and is generally used to measure agricultural output.

The Old English, 'maund' may also be the origin of Maundy Thursday. As a verb, 'maund' :  to beg; as a noun, 'a maund' : a small basket held out for alms.

==Origins==
Anglicized as "maund", the ' ''mun'' ' as a unit of weight is thought to be of at least [[Chaldea]]n origin,&lt;ref name="Hayyim"&gt;{{citation | last = Hayyim | first = Sulayman | title = New Persian-English dictionary, complete and modern, designed to give the English meanings of over 50,000 words, terms, idioms, and proverbs in the Persian language, as well as the transliteration of the words in English characters. Together with a sufficient treatment of all the grammatical features of the Persian Language | url = http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/hayyim/ | location = Teheran | publisher = Librairie-imprimerie Beroukhim | year = 1934–1936 | volume = 2 | page = 988}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Henry Yule|Sir Henry Yule]] attributing [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] origins to the word.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''[[maneh (unit)|maneh]]'' (מנה) and the [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[mina (unit)|mina]]'' (μνᾶ) are thought to be cognate.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Prinsep | first = James | year = 1840 | title = Useful tables, forming an appendix to the Journal of the Asiatic Society: part the first, Coins, weights, and measures of British India | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LTYGAAAAQAAJ | edition = 2nd | location = Calcutta | publisher = Bishop's College Press | page = 80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally equal to one-ninth of the weight of an ''[[artaba]]'' of water,&lt;ref name="DourstherBat"&gt;{{citation | last = Doursther | first = Horace | title = Dictionnaire universel des poids et mesures anciens et modernes | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KAibOR651tkC | location = Brussels | publisher = Hayez | year = 1840 | pages = 51–52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or approximately four to seven [[kilogram]]s in modern units.

The modification of the vowel in the anglicized name is thought to be an indication that the word came into English via [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. The Portuguese version was ''mão'' ({{IPA-pt|ˈmɐ̃w̃|pron}}, as in the word for "hand"), a regular {{IPA|[aːn]}} → {{IPA|[ɐ̃w̃]}} development in Portuguese.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;

==South Asia==
{{British Indian units of mass}}

=== Delhi Sultanate ===

During the reign of [[Alauddin Khalji]] of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], 1 ''mann'' was roughly equivalent to 15 kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Satish Chandra |author-link=Satish Chandra |title=History of Medieval India: 800-1700 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qHnHHwAACAAJ |year=2014 |orig-year=2007 |publisher=Orient Longman |isbn=978-81-250-3226-7 |page=103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mughal Empire===
Prinsep (1840) summarizes the evidence as to the weight of the ''mun'' (later "maund") during the reign (1556–1605) of [[Akbar the Great]],&lt;ref name="mun"&gt;{{citation | last = Prinsep | first = James | year = 1840 | title = Useful tables, forming an appendix to the Journal of the Asiatic Society: part the first, Coins, weights, and measures of British India | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LTYGAAAAQAAJ | edition = 2nd | location = Calcutta | publisher = Bishop's College Press | page = 81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which comes from the ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' written by the [[vizier]] [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] (anglicized as "Abul Fuzl"). The principal definition is that the ''mun'' is forty ''[[Seer (unit)|seers]]''; and that each ''seer'' is thirty ''[[Dam (unit)|dams]]''.
:1 ''mun'' = 40 ''seers'' = 1200 ''dams''
The problem arises in assigning the values of the smaller units. 

The section of the ''Ain-i-Akbari'' that defines the ''mun'' also defines the ''dam'' as five ''[[Tank (unit)|tanks]]''. A separate section defines the ''tank'' as twenty-four ''[[ruttee]]s''. However, by the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, the ''tank'' was no longer a uniform unit across the former Mughal territories: Prinsep quotes values of 50&amp;nbsp;grains (3.24&amp;nbsp;g) in [[Dharwad|Darwar]], 72&amp;nbsp;grains (4.67&amp;nbsp;g) in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and 268&amp;nbsp;grains (17.37&amp;nbsp;g) in [[Ahmednagar|Ahmednugur]].&lt;ref name="mun"/&gt; 

The ''jilály'', a square [[silver]] [[rupee]] coin issued by Akbar, was said by the ''Ain-i-Akbari'' to be 11¼&amp;nbsp;''[[masha (unit)|mashas]]'' in weight: surviving ''jilály'' and other Mughal rupee coins weigh 170–175&amp;nbsp;[[Grain (unit)|Troy grains]] (11.02–11.34&amp;nbsp;g), so the ''masha'', defined as eight ''ruttees'', would be about 15½&amp;nbsp;grains (1&amp;nbsp;g). ''Masha'' weights sent back to London in 1819 agree with this value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Prinsep | first = James | year = 1840 | title = Useful tables, forming an appendix to the Journal of the Asiatic Society: part the first, Coins, weights, and measures of British India | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LTYGAAAAQAAJ | edition = 2nd | location = Calcutta | publisher = Bishop's College Press | pages = 17–18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This basis gives a ''mun'' of 34¾&amp;nbsp;lb. av. (15¾&amp;nbsp;kg). One ''Koni'' was 4 muns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O2WSRW2t3XYC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=koni+mughal+weight&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QYatC0UyLu&amp;sig=kSl8uveDfyCfFESOjSMjOwVP3SU&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=koni%20mughal%20weight&amp;f=false Kashmir Under Maharaja Ranjit Singh]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in yet another section of the ''Ain-i-Akbari'', the ''dam'' is said to be "twenty ''mashas'' seven ''ruttees''": using this definition would imply an [[Imperial units|Imperial mass]] of about 47&amp;nbsp;lb. av. (21⅓&amp;nbsp;kg) for the ''mun''. Between these two values, the maund in Central India was often found to be around 40&amp;nbsp;lb. av. (18&amp;nbsp;kg) in the [[East India Company]] survey of 1821.

A Maund was 55.5 British pounds under Akbar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Narang|first1=Kirpal Singh|last2=Gupta|first2=Hari Ram|title=History of the Pubnab, 1500-1858|edition=2nd.|year=1969|publisher=U.C. Kapur|location=Delhi|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nineteenth century===
[[File:IGI1908India1837a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] is shown in pink on this 1837 map. The Madras Presidency is in the southeast, the Bombay Presidency is in the west and the Bengal Presidency is in the northeast.]]
{{quotation|The maund of India may as a ''genus'' be divided into four different ''species'': 
#That of Bengal, containing 40 seers, and averaging about 80 lbs. avoir.
#That of Central India (Malwa, Ajmeer, &amp;c.) generally equal to 40 lbs. avoir. and containing 20 seers (so that the seer of this large portion of the continent assimilates to that of Bengal.)
#The maund of Guzerat and Bombay, equal to ¼ cwt. or 28 pounds and divided into 40 seers of smaller grade.
#The maund of Southern India, fixed by the Madras government at 25 lbs. avoir.
There are, however many other varieties of maund, from 15 to 64 seers in weight; which it is unnecessary to particularize.|Prinsep (1840), p.&amp;nbsp;77}}

Prinsep's values for the maund come from a survey organized by the [[East India Company]] in 1821. The Company's agents were asked to send back examples of the standard weights and measures used in the places they were stationed, and these were compared with the English standards in London by [[Patrick Kelly (metrologist)|Patrick Kelly]], the leading British metrologist of the time. The results were published as an appendix to the second edition of Kelly's ''Universal Cambist'' (1831), and later as a separate book entitled ''Oriental Metrology'' (1832).

It will be seen from Kelly's results below that Prinsep's generalizations are only partially correct. The [[Gujarat]] maund is more closely related to the Central Indian maund than to the standardized Bombay maund, except in the town of [[Anjar, India|Anjar]], except that it is divided into 40&amp;nbsp;seers instead of 20 as was found in [[Malwa (Madhya Pradesh)|Malwa]].

'''Medium Earth orbit''' ('''MEO'''), sometimes called '''intermediate circular orbit''' ('''ICO'''), is the region of [[outer space|space]] around [[Earth]] above [[low Earth orbit]] ([[altitude]] of {{convert|2000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]]) and below [[geostationary orbit]] (altitude of {{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} above sea level).&lt;ref name=nasa20120718&gt;

'''Molybdenum disilicide''' ('''MoSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', or '''molybdenum silicide'''), an [[intermetallic compound]], a [[silicide]] of [[molybdenum]], is a [[refractory material|refractory]] [[ceramic]] with primary use in [[heating element]]s. It has moderate [[density]], melting point 2030&amp;nbsp;°C, and is [[electrically conductive]]. At high temperatures it forms a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation layer]] of [[silicon dioxide]], protecting it from further oxidation. It is a gray metallic-looking material with [[tetragonal]] [[crystal structure]] (alpha-modification); its beta-modification is [[hexagonal (crystal system)|hexagonal]] and unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J. Appl. Phys. |volume=51|issue=11|pages= 5976 |year=1980|doi=10.1063/1.327517 |title=Observations on the hexagonal form of MoSi2 and WSi2 films produced by ion implantation and on related snowplow effects|author=F. M. d’Heurle, C. S. Petersson, and M. Y. Tsai }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is insoluble in most acids but soluble in [[nitric acid]] and [[hydrofluoric acid]].

While MoSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has excellent resistance to oxidation and high [[Young's modulus]] at temperatures above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C, it is [[brittle]] in lower temperatures. Also, at above 1200&amp;nbsp;°C it loses [[creep (deformation)|creep]] resistance. These properties limits its use as a [[structural material]], but may be offset by using it together with another material as a [[composite material]].

Molybdenum disilicide and MoSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based materials are usually made by [[sintering]]. [[Plasma spraying]] can be used for producing its dense monolithic and composite forms; material produced this way may contain a proportion of β-MoSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; due to its rapid cooling.

Molybdenum disilicide heating elements can be used for temperatures up to 1800&amp;nbsp;°C, in electric [[furnace]]s used in laboratory and production environment in production of [[glass]], [[steel]], [[electronics]], [[ceramic]]s, and in [[heat treatment]] of materials. While the elements are brittle, they can operate at high power without aging, and their electrical resistivity does not increase with operation time. Their maximum [[operating temperature]] has to be lowered in atmospheres with low oxygen content due to breakdown of the passivation layer.

Other ceramic materials used for heating elements are e.g. [[silicon carbide]], [[barium titanate]], and [[lead titanate]] [[composite material]]s.

Molybdenum disilicide is used in [[microelectronics]] as a contact material. It is often used as a [[shunt (electrical)|shunt]] over [[polysilicon]] lines to increase their conductivity and increase signal speed.

[[Image:Kudurru of Nazi-Maruttash.jpg|thumb|160px|Kudurru of Nazi-Maruttash.]]
The '''Nazimaruttash kudurru stone''' is a boundary stone ([[kudurru]]) of [[Nazimaruttaš]], a [[Kassites|Kassite]] king of [[Babylon]], ca. 1307–1282 BC ([[short chronology]]). It was found at [[Susa]] and is now displayed at the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]].

Some kudurrus are known for their portrayal of the king, etc., who consigned it. Most kudurrus portray [[Mesopotamia]]n gods, which are often portrayed graphically in segmented ''[[Register (sculpture)|register]]s'' on the stone. Nazimaruttash's kudurru does not use registers. Instead, graphic symbols are used. Nineteen deities are invoked to curse the foolhardy individual who seeks to desecrate it. Some are represented by symbols, such as a goat-fish for [[Enki]] or a bird on a pole for [[Papsukkal]], a spear-head for [[Marduk]] or an eight-pointed star for [[Ishtar]]. Shamash is represented by a disc.&lt;ref name=farbridge&gt;{{ cite book | title = Studies in Biblical and Semitic Symbolism | author = Maurice H.

'''Nuclear knowledge management''' (NKM) is [[knowledge management]] as applied in the [[nuclear technology]] field. It supports the gathering and sharing of new knowledge and the updating of the existing [[knowledge base]]. Knowledge management is of particular importance in the nuclear sector, owing to the rapid development and complexity of nuclear technologies and their [[Nuclear safety and security|hazards and security implications]]. The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) launched a nuclear knowledge management programme in 2002.

==Definition of nuclear knowledge management==
Nuclear knowledge management is defined as [[knowledge management]] in the nuclear domain. This simple definition is consistent with the working definition used in the [[IAEA]] document "Knowledge Management for Nuclear Industry Operating Organizations" (2006).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/inisnkm/nkm/documents/te_1510_web.pdf "Knowledge Management for Nuclear Industry Operating Organizations"] – International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA TECDOC Series No. 1510, October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Knowledge management]] (KM) itself is defined as an integrated, systematic approach to identifying, acquiring, transforming, developing, disseminating, using, sharing, and preserving knowledge, relevant to achieving specified objectives.

==Description==
Knowledge management systems support nuclear organizations in strengthening and aligning their knowledge. Knowledge is the nuclear energy industry’s most valuable asset and resource, without which the industry cannot operate safely and economically.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Nuclear knowledge is also very complex, expensive to acquire and maintain, and easily lost.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} States, suppliers, and operating organizations that deploy nuclear technology are responsible for ensuring that the associated nuclear knowledge is maintained and accessible.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
 
In the organizational context, nuclear knowledge management supports the organization's [[business process]]es, and involves applying knowledge management practices. These may be applied at any stage of a nuclear facility's life cycle: research and development, design and engineering, construction, commissioning, operations, maintenance, refurbishment and life time extension, waste management, and decommissioning. Nuclear knowledge management issues and priorities are often unique to the particular circumstances of individual Member States and their nuclear industry organizations. Nuclear knowledge management practices enhance and support traditional business functions and goals such as human resource management, training, planning, operations, maintenance, projects, innovation, performance and risk management, information management, process management, organizational learning and information technology support.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
 
A nuclear knowledge management strategy, with clearly defined objectives, provides a framework for establishing principles, policy, priorities and plans to apply knowledge management practices in the workplace.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
 
==Implementation==
Knowledge management focuses on ''people'' and organizational culture to stimulate and nurture the sharing and use of knowledge; on ''processes'' or methods to find, create, capture and share knowledge; and on ''technology'' to store and assimilate knowledge and to make it readily accessible in a manner which will allow people to work together even if they are not located together. People are the most important component in a KM system and the creation of new knowledge is one of its most valuable byproducts. For a KM system to function properly, the people involved must be willing to share and re-use existing knowledge and to cooperatively generate new knowledge to the advantage of the organization.

Due to the nature of nuclear power plant operating organizations (high hazard but low risk), a number of knowledge management activities and programmes have been in place throughout the industry to manage and control the knowledge and information related to nuclear power plant design, construction, operation and maintenance. Examples of such
existing KM activities employed by [[Nuclear power plant|NPPs]] and in most other nuclear technology facilities include the following functions:

* Plant policies and procedures;
* Communication techniques;
* Configuration management;
* Document control;
* Work control systems;
* Quality assurance and quality management;
* Operating experience programmes;
* Corrective action systems;
* Safety analysis;
* Training and development;
* Human resource management;
* Company intranet and other web-based strategies.

The implementation of a KM system is not intended to replace any of these systems, but rather should increase the benefits to be derived from these systems in conjunction with the deployment of an integrated management system. Properly implemented KM should increase the benefits to the organization of these existing activities, rather than substituting for them. The lessons learned in the nuclear industry in the past 20 years, moving away from inspection by large [[quality assurance]] organizations towards building quality into all facility processes, have considerable relevance for KM implementation.

==Motivation for nuclear knowledge management programs==
It is probable that nuclear knowledge will continue to expand and change. Without diligence in managing nuclear knowledge, substantial portions of it could be lost due to personnel retirements and the likelihood that much of it could be disused or discarded as a result of either negligence or changing priorities. It will be as important to identify and properly treat obsolete, superseded knowledge as it will be to gather and share new knowledge. It is therefore necessary to maintain effective and efficient KM systems.

NKM has become an increasingly important element of the nuclear sector in recent years, resulting from a number of challenges and trends:

* Countries with expanding [[nuclear power|nuclear programmes]] require skilled and trained [[human resources]] to design and operate future nuclear installations. [[Capacity building]] through training and education and transferring knowledge from centres of knowledge to centres of growth are key issues. 
* In countries with stagnating nuclear programmes, the challenge is to secure the human resources needed to sustain the safe operation of existing installations, including their [[decommissioning nuclear facilities|decommissioning]] and related programmes for spent fuel and waste. Replacing retiring staff and attracting the young generation to a career in the nuclear field are key challenges. 
* Non-power applications of nuclear technologies require a stable or even growing base of nuclear knowledge and trained human resources, be it for [[nuclear medicine|cancer treatment]] or for [[Nuclear_technology#Food_processing_and_agriculture|food and agriculture]]. This need is present in all Member States using nuclear technologies, independent of the use of nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/nuclearenergy/nuclearknowledge/about-nkm.html IAEA webpage for the Nuclear Knowledge Management Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear energy===
Concerns about global [[climate change]] and the availability of economically exploitable [[fossil fuel]]s are driving many countries to reconsider the use of nuclear energy. Yet, the innovations required to design, construct, operate and maintain nuclear power plants consistent with international needs and constraints must derive from a strong foundation of well-sustained nuclear knowledge. 

In contrast to knowledge in other scientific domains, the free sharing and uncontrolled use of nuclear knowledge are severely restricted due to concerns about [[nuclear security]] and [[nuclear proliferation|proliferation]]. On the other hand, ensuring nuclear ''safety'' requires free sharing of information and experience to avoid repetition of [[nuclear accident|accident]] precursors. Risks to nuclear safety could be very high due to the nature and size of third party liability and the possibility of nuclear security being severely compromised. In managing nuclear knowledge, therefore, an appropriate balance between nuclear safety and security requirements needs to be established.

===Other sectors===
The applications of nuclear technology in the non-power areas enumerated above tends to be less controversial than nuclear power. Knowledge in these areas is broadly disseminated and – in many cases – is freely shared. Effective and efficient systems of managing nuclear knowledge form the basis for refining existing applications and developing new, even more widely used applications.

==IAEA program on nuclear knowledge management==
The importance of nuclear knowledge management is increasingly being recognized in the industry. The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) has been a repository of knowledge related to peaceful applications of nuclear technology from the time the organization was established in 1957. Nuclear Knowledge Management came in the forefront in the IAEA as a formal programme to address Member States' priorities in the 21st century. Several resolutions adopted at the IAEA General Conference since 2002 include knowledge management topics.

The IAEA Secretariat was urged to assist member states, at their request, in fostering and preserving nuclear education and training in all areas of [[nuclear technology]] for peaceful purposes; in developing guidance on and methodologies for planning, designing and implementing nuclear knowledge management programmes; in providing Member States with reliable information resources on the peaceful use of nuclear energy; and in continuing to develop tools and methods to capture, retain, share, utilize and preserve nuclear knowledge.

The IAEA has organized a number of international meetings, schools and conferences covering a wide range of topics, from general concepts that underpin nuclear knowledge management to specific methods and tools taught at training seminars for practitioners.&lt;ref name="Tipping2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip G Tipping|title=Understanding and Mitigating Ageing in Nuclear Power Plants: Materials and Operational Aspects of Plant Life Management (PLIM)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pVwAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA832|date=26 October 2010|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-1-84569-995-6|page=832}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HoldenGlisby2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nigel Holden|author2=Martin Glisby|title=Creating Knowledge Advantage: The Tacit Dimensions of International Competition and Cooperation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRtoFBKQsJcC&amp;pg=PA38|date=January 2010|publisher=Copenhagen Business School Press DK|isbn=978-87-630-0230-1|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IAEA Nuclear Knowledge Management Programme was headed by [[Yanko Yanev]] (2002–2012) and by John de Grosbois (since 2012).

==Etymology==
[[File:Pineapple and cross section.jpg|thumb|Pineapple and its cross-section]]
[[File:Flowering Pineapple Sept 4 2011.jpg|thumb|A young pineapple in flower]]
The word "pineapple" in English was first recorded to describe the [[plant reproductive morphology|reproductive organs]] of [[conifer]] trees (now termed [[Conifer cone|pine cones]]). When European explorers encountered this tropical fruit in the Americas, they called them "pineapples" (first referenced in 1664, for resemblance to pine cones).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/pineapple|title=Pineapple|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries, Oxford University Press|date=2015|accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.doleplantation.com/resources/ |title=History of the Pineapple|publisher=Dole Food Co., Dole Plantation|date=2015|accessdate=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the scientific binomial ''Ananas comosus'', ''ananas'', the original name of the fruit, comes from the [[Tupian languages|Tupi]] word ''nanas'', meaning "excellent fruit",&lt;ref&gt;Davidson A. (2008) The Penguin Companion to Food. Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; as recorded by [[André Thevet]] in 1555, and ''comosus'', "tufted", refers to the stem of the fruit. Other members of the genus ''[[Ananas]]'' are often called pine, as well, in other languages. 

==Botany==
[[File:PineApple - Ananas comosus - starting stage.jpg|thumb|Pineapple in the starting stage]]
The pineapple is a [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] [[perennial]], which grows to {{convert|1.0|to|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, although sometimes it can be taller. In appearance, the plant has a short, stocky stem with tough, waxy leaves. When creating its fruit, it usually produces up to 200 flowers, although some large-fruited cultivars can exceed this. Once it flowers, the individual fruits of the flowers join together to create what is commonly referred to as a pineapple. After the first fruit is produced, side shoots (called 'suckers' by commercial growers) are produced in the leaf axils of the main stem. These may be removed for propagation, or left to produce additional fruits on the original plant.&lt;ref name="PWG" /&gt; Commercially, suckers that appear around the base are cultivated. It has 30 or more long, narrow, fleshy, trough-shaped leaves with sharp spines along the margins that are {{convert|30|to|100|cm|ft|1|abbr=on}} long, surrounding a thick [[plant stem|stem]]. In the first year of growth, the axis lengthens and thickens, bearing numerous leaves in close spirals. After 12 to 20 months, the stem grows into a spike-like inflorescence up to {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} long with over 100 spirally arranged, trimerous flowers, each subtended by a bract. 

The ovaries develop into berries, which coalesce into a large, compact, multiple fruit. The fruit of a pineapple is arranged in two interlocking helices, eight in one direction, 13 in the other, each being a [[Fibonacci number#Fibonacci numbers in nature|Fibonacci number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J.|last=Jones|last2=Wilson |first2=W |title=An Incomplete Education |publisher=Ballantine |year=2006|isbn=978-0-7394-7582-9|page=544|chapter=Chapter 11: Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pineapple carries out [[Crassulacean acid metabolism|CAM photosynthesis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/economicbotany/Ananas/ |title=Pineapple – The Plant That Ate Hawai'i |last=Gibson |first=Arthur C. |website=UCLA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304012552/http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/economicbotany/Ananas/ |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; fixing carbon dioxide at night and storing it as the acid [[malate]], then releasing it during the day aiding photosynthesis.

==Pollination==
In the wild, pineapples are pollinated primarily by [[hummingbird]]s.&lt;ref name="Morton 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3359915|year=2012|author1=Stahl|first1=J.

R|doi=10.1093/aob/mcs053|pmid=22455992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain wild pineapples are [[forage]]d and pollinated at night by [[bat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conflict Between Pteropodid Bats and Fruit Growers: Species, Legislation and Mitigation.

Under cultivation, because seed development diminishes fruit quality, pollination is performed by hand, and seeds are retained only for [[plant breeding|breeding]].&lt;ref name="Morton 1987" /&gt; Specifically in Hawaii, where pineapples were cultivated and [[cannery|canned]] industrially throughout the [[20th century]],&lt;ref name="hortsci"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bartholomew DP|author2=Hawkins RA|author3=Lopez JA|title=Hawaii Pineapple: The Rise and Fall of an Industry|journal=HortScience|date=2012|volume=47|issue=10|pages=1390–1398|url=http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/content/47/10/1390.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; importation of [[hummingbird]]s was prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of prohibited animals|url=http://hdoa.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AR-71P.pdf|publisher=Government of Hawaii, Department of Agriculture|date=28 November 2006|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pineapple Juice.jpg|thumb|upright|Pineapple juice]]
The flesh and juice of the pineapple are used in cuisines around the world. In many tropical countries, pineapple is prepared and sold on roadsides as a snack. It is sold whole or in halves with a stick inserted. Whole, cored slices with a [[cherry]] in the middle are a common garnish on hams in the West. Chunks of pineapple are used in desserts such as fruit salad, as well as in some savory dishes, including pizza toppings, or as a grilled ring on a [[hamburger]]. Crushed pineapple is used in yogurt, jam, sweets, and ice cream. The juice of the pineapple is served as a beverage, and it is also the main ingredient in [[cocktail]]s such as the ''[[piña colada]]'' and in the drink ''[[tepache]]''.

==Nutrition==
In a 100-gram reference amount, raw pineapple is a rich source of [[manganese]] (44% [[Dietary Reference Intake|Daily Value]], DV) and [[vitamin C]] (58% DV), but otherwise contains no [[essential nutrients]] in significant quantities (table).&lt;ref name="ND"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/2019/2 | title=Nutrient data for pineapple, raw, all varieties, per 100&amp;nbsp;g serving | publisher=Nutritiondata.com, USDA SR-21 | accessdate=2012-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bromelain===
Present in all parts of the pineapple plant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Appl Microbiol Biotechnol|year=2014|volume=98|issue=17|pages=7283–97|doi=10.1007/s00253-014-5889-y|title=
Bromelain: an overview of industrial application and purification strategies|authors=Arshad ZI, Amid A, Yusof F, Jaswir I, Ahmad K, Loke SP|pmid=24965557}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bromelain]] is a mixture of [[proteolytic]] [[enzyme]]s. Bromelain is under preliminary research for a variety of clinical disorders, but to date has not been adequately defined for its effects in the human body.&lt;ref name="mlp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/895.html|title=Bromelain|publisher=MedlinePlus, US National Institutes of Health|date=2015|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bromelain may be unsafe for some users, such as in [[pregnancy]], [[allergies]], or [[anticoagulation]] therapy.&lt;ref name=mlp /&gt;

If having sufficient bromelain content, raw pineapple juice may be useful as a meat [[marinade]] and [[tenderizer]].&lt;ref name="jfst"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Food Sci Technol|year=2015|volume=52|issue=6|pages=3870–80|doi=10.1007/s13197-014-1454-z|title=Efficacy of reverse micellar extracted fruit bromelain in meat tenderization|authors=Chaurasiya RS, Sakhare PZ, Bhaskar N, Hebbar HU|pmid=26028772|pmc=4444899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although pineapple enzymes can interfere with the preparation of some foods or manufactured products, such as [[gelatin]]-based desserts or [[gel]] [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=AAPS PharmSciTech|year=2014|volume=15|issue=6|pages=1410–6|doi=10.1208/s12249-014-0162-3|title=Enzymes in the dissolution testing of gelatin capsules|author=Marques MR|pmid=24942315|pmc=4245433}}&lt;/ref&gt; their proteolytic activity responsible for such properties may be degraded during cooking and [[canning]]. The quantity of bromelain in a typical serving of pineapple fruit is probably not significant, but specific [[extraction (chemistry)|extraction]] can yield sufficient quantities for [[home|domestic]] and industrial processing.&lt;ref name="jfst" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Appl Microbiol Biotechnol|year=2014|volume=98|issue=17|pages=7283–97|doi=10.1007/s00253-014-5889-y|title=Bromelain: an overview of industrial application and purification strategies|authors=Arshad ZI, Amid A, Yusof F, Jaswir I, Ahmad K, Loke SP|pmid=24965557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bromelain content of raw pineapple is responsible for the sore mouth feeling often experienced when eating it,  due to the enzymes breaking down the proteins of sensitive tissues in the mouth. Also, [[raphide]]s, needle-shaped crystals of [[calcium oxalate]] that occur in pineapple fruits and leaves, likely cause microabrasions, contributing to mouth discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Does Eating Pineapple Make Your Mouth Sore? &amp;#124; IFLScience |url=http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/why-does-eating-pineapple-make-your-mouth-sore/ |date=2015-10-08 |accessdate=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Konno |first1=Kotaro |title=Synergistic Defensive Function of Raphides and Protease through the Needle Effect |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=9 |issue=3 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0091341 |date=2014-03-12 |pages=e91341 |pmid=24621613 |pmc=3951349|bibcode=2014PLoSO...991341K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Modi |first1=Gunjan M |last2=Doherty |first2=Christy B |last3=Katta |first3=Rajani |last4=Orengo |first4=Ida F |title=Irritant Contact Dermatitis from Plants |journal=Dermatitis |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=63–78 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/706404_3 |date=2009 |accessdate=2016-09-06|pmid=19426612 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The plant is indigenous to South America and is said to originate from the area between southern Brazil and Paraguay;&lt;ref name="Morton 1987" /&gt; however, little is known about the origin of the domesticated pineapple (Pickersgill, 1976). MS Bertoni (1919)&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni, "Contributions a l'étude botanique des plantes cultivées. Essai d'une monographie du genre Ananas",  Annales Cient.

Columbus encountered the pineapple in 1493 on the leeward island of Guadeloupe. He called it ''piña de Indes'', meaning "pine of the Indians", and brought it back with him to Spain, thus making the pineapple the first [[bromeliad]] to be introduced by humans outside of the New World.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McKenzie | first1 = Gene | title = A Little Bit of History | journal = Journal of the Bromeliad Society | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 187–189 | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish introduced it into the [[Philippines]], [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaii]] (introduced in the early 19th century, first commercial plantation 1886), [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Guam]].

[[File:Charles-pineapple.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles II of England|Charles II]] is presented with the first pineapple grown in England (1675 painting by [[Hendrik Danckerts]]).]]
The pineapple was brought to northern Europe by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] from their colony in [[Surinam]].

[[Catherine the Great]] ate pineapples grown on her own estates before her death in 1796.{{sfnp|Beauman|2005|p=89}} Because of the expense of direct import and the enormous cost in equipment and labour required to grow them in a temperate climate, using [[Greenhouse|hothouses]] called "pineries", pineapples soon became a symbol of wealth. They were initially used mainly for display at dinner parties, rather than being eaten, and were used again and again until they began to rot.{{sfnp|Beauman|2005|p=87}} By the second half of the 18th century, the production of the fruit on British estates had become the subject of great rivalry between wealthy aristocrats.{{sfnp|Beauman|2005|p=87}} [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore]] built a hothouse on his estate surmounted by a huge stone [[cupola]] 14 metres tall in the shape of the fruit; it is known as the [[Dunmore Pineapple]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Jack, ''Exploring Scotland's Heritage: Glasgow, Clydesdale and Stirling''.

[[John Kidwell]] is credited with the introduction of the pineapple industry to Hawaii; large-scale pineapple cultivation by US companies began in the early 1900s. Among the most famous and influential pineapple industrialists was [[James Dole]], who moved to Hawaii in 1899&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = Richard | title = James D Dole and the 1932 Failure of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company | journal = Hawaiian Journal of History | volume = 41 | pages = 149–170 | year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and started a pineapple plantation in 1900.&lt;ref name="faculty.ucc.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.ucc.edu/biology-ombrello/pow/pineapple.htm |title=Pineapple |publisher=Faculty.ucc.edu |accessdate=2009-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221093456/http://faculty.ucc.edu/biology-ombrello/pow/pineapple.htm |archivedate=21 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The companies [[Dole Food Company|Dole]] and [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]] began growing pineapples on the island of [[Oahu]] in 1901 and 1917, respectively. Dole's pineapple company began with the acquisition of {{convert|60|acres|0|abbr=on}} of land in 1901, and grew into a major company, the [[Dole Food Company]]. [[Maui Pineapple Company]] began pineapple cultivation on the island of [[Maui]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Sunrise, Sunset | journal = Hawaii Business | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | page = 60 | year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, world production of pineapples was 25.8 million tonnes, led by [[Costa Rica]], [[Brazil]], and the [[Philippines]], which collectively accounted for 32% of the global total (table).&lt;ref name=faostat16 /&gt;

==Cultivation==
[[File:Del Monte Pineapple field at Camp Philips, Bukidnon, Philippines 03.jpg|thumb|Pineapple fields in [[Bukidnon]], [[Philippines]]]]
In commercial farming, flowering can be induced artificially, and the early harvesting of the main fruit can encourage the development of a second crop of smaller fruits. Once removed during cleaning, the top of the pineapple can be planted in soil and a new plant will grow. Slips and suckers are planted commercially.&lt;ref name="Morton 1987" /&gt;
[[File:Ananas bracteatus, Dole Pineapple Plantation, Oahu, Hawaii, USA2.jpg|thumb|[[Red pineapple]] (''Ananas bracteatus'')]]
Pineapples can be consumed fresh, cooked, juiced, or preserved. They are found in a wide array of [[cuisine]]s.   In addition to consumption, the pineapple leaves are used to produce the textile fiber ''[[piña]]'' in the Philippines, commonly used as the material for the men's ''[[barong Tagalog]]'' and women's ''[[baro't saya]]'' [[formal wear]] in the country.  The fiber is also used as a component for wallpaper and other furnishings.&lt;ref&gt;"piña cloth". Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia. The Free Dictionary.

===Ethical and environmental concerns===
Three-quarters of the pineapples sold in Europe are grown in Costa Rica, where pineapple production is highly industrialised. Growers typically use {{convert|20|kg|abbr=on}} of [[pesticides]] per hectare in each growing cycle,&lt;ref name="Bitter fruit" /&gt; a process that may affect soil quality and biodiversity. The pesticides—[[organophosphates]], [[organochlorines]], and [[Endocrine disruptor|hormone disruptors]]—have the potential to affect workers' health and can contaminate local drinking water supplies.&lt;ref name="Bitter fruit" /&gt; Many of these chemicals have potential to be [[carcinogen]]s, and may be related to [[birth defects]].&lt;ref name="Bitter fruit" /&gt;

Because of commercial pressures, many pineapple workers in Costa Rica—60% of whom are [[Nicaragua]]n—are paid low wages.{{Quantify|date=July 2011}} European supermarkets' price-reduction policies have lowered growers' incomes.&lt;ref name="Bitter fruit"&gt;{{cite news

Pineapple pink disease (not citrus pink disease) is characterized by the fruit developing a brownish to black discoloration when heated during the canning process.

Some pests that commonly affect pineapple plants are scales, [[thrip]]s, mites, mealybugs, ants, and [[symphylid]]s.&lt;ref name="foodmarketexchange1" /&gt;

Heart-rot is the most serious disease affecting pineapple plants. The disease is caused by ''Phytophthora cinnamoni'' and ''P. parasitica,'' fungi that often affect pineapples grown in wet conditions. Since it is difficult to treat, it is advisable to guard against infection by planting resistant cultivars where these are available; all [[Suckers (botany)|suckers]] that are required for propagation should be dipped in a fungicide, since the fungus enters through the wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Gardening|last=Brickell|first=Christopher|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Publishers Limited|year=1996|isbn=978-1-85833-579-7|location=9 Henrietta Street, London WC2 8PS|pages=419|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage and transport==
Some buyers prefer green fruit, others ripened or off-green. A plant growth regulator, [[Ethephon]], is typically sprayed onto the fruit one week before harvest, developing [[ethylene]], which turns the fruit golden yellow. After cleaning and slicing, a pineapple is typically canned in sugar syrup with added preservative.&lt;ref name="Morton 1987" /&gt;

A pineapple never becomes any riper than it was when harvested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/21/garden/a-guide-to-choosing-a-ripe-pineapple.html | title=A guide to choosing a ripe pineapple |work=The New York Times |date= 21 April 1982|first=Mimi |last=Sheraton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fruit itself is quite perishable&lt;ref name="Morton 1987" /&gt; and if it is stored at room temperature, it should be used within two days; however, if it is refrigerated, the time span extends to 5–7 days.

==Symbolism and cultural history==
[[Mimi Sheller]] writes: "The pineapple entered European iconography as a symbol of welcome and hospitality, and also eventually found its way into botanical gardens such as the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]], where it was grown in heated pits."&lt;ref name="Sheller"&gt;Mimi Sheller, ''Consuming the Caribbean: From Arawaks to Zombies'' (Routledge: 2003), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The sweet fruit had a "mysterious aura" in the [[Age of Sail]] because except for a "small elite with access to glass hothouses", tropical fruits could only be tasted where they were cultivated.&lt;ref name="Sheller" /&gt; Christopher Cumo writes that "The Spanish who followed Columbus delighted in eating pineapple and in writing about it for a European public eager to learn of the flora and fauna of the Americas ... The pineapple was first a luxury because transit from the tropics to Europe was expensive in the age of sail.  In this respect, pineapple was much like sugar, a commodity of privilege before it became an item of the masses."&lt;ref name="Cumo"&gt;Christopher Cumo, ''Foods that Changed History: How Foods Shaped Civilization from the Ancient World to the Present'' (ABC-CLIO, 2015), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Cumo writes that "pineapple was the fruit of colonialism" because the Portuguese, French, Dutch, and British all sought to establish pineapple plantations in the tropics of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Cumo" /&gt;

In architecture, pineapple figures are a decorative element symbolizing [[hospitality]].&lt;ref name="Curl"&gt;[[James Stevens Curl]], ''Classical Architecture: An Introduction to Its Vocabulary and Essentials, with a Select Glossary of Terms'' (W. W. Norton: 2003), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrison"&gt;Hugh Morrison, ''Early American Architecture: From the First Colonial Settlements to the National Period'' (Oxford University Press, 1952), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;[[Cyril Manton Harris]], ''American Architecture: An Illustrated Encyclopedia'' (W.

Pineapples have long been associated with the Hawaiian Islands, to the extent that the pineapple is sometimes used as a symbol of Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.to-hawaii.com/agriculture/pineapple.php The Agriculture of Hawaii: Hawaii Pineapples], To-Hawaii.com; accessed 2018.08.28.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the decline of the pineapple industry in that state.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Duane P.

In physics, '''potential energy''' is the [[energy]] held by an object because of its position relative to other objects, stresses within itself, its electric charge, or other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jain, Mahesh C.|chapter=Fundamental forces and laws: a brief review|title=Textbook Of Engineering Physics, Part 1|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

Common types of potential energy include the [[gravitational potential energy]] of an object that depends on its [[mass]] and its distance from the center of mass of another object, the [[elastic potential energy]] of an extended spring, and the [[electric potential energy]] of an [[electric charge]] in an [[electric field]]. The unit for energy in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) is the [[joule]], which has the symbol J.

The term ''potential energy'' was introduced by the 19th century Scottish engineer and physicist [[William Rankine]],&lt;ref&gt;William John Macquorn Rankine (1853) "On the general law of the transformation of energy," ''Proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow'', vol. 3, no. 5, pages 276-280; reprinted in: '''(1)''' ''Philosophical Magazine'', series 4, vol. 5, no. 30, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3Ov22-gFMnEC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 106-117] (February 1853); and '''(2)''' W. J. Millar, ed., ''Miscellaneous Scientific Papers: by W. J. Macquorn Rankine'', ... (London, England: Charles Griffin and Co., 1881), part II, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-kRB9v6KRvsC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 203-208].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Smith | first = Crosbie | title = The Science of Energy - a Cultural History of Energy Physics in Victorian Britain | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | date = 1998 | isbn = 0-226-76420-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it has links to Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]]'s concept of [[Potentiality and Actuality|potentiality]].
Potential energy is associated with forces that act on a body in a way that the total work done by these forces on the body depends only on the initial and final positions of the body in space. These forces, that are called ''conservative forces'', can be represented at every point in space by vectors expressed as gradients of a certain scalar function called ''potential''.

Since the work of potential forces acting on a body that moves from a start to an end position is determined only by these two positions, and does not depend on the trajectory of the body, there is a function known as ''potential'' or ''potential energy'' that can be evaluated at the two positions to determine this work.

==Overview==
There are various types of potential energy, each associated with a particular type of force. For example, the work of an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] force is called elastic potential energy; work of the gravitational force is called gravitational potential energy; work of the [[Coulomb force]] is called [[electric potential energy]]; work of the [[strong nuclear force]] or [[weak nuclear force]] acting on the [[baryon]] [[charge (physics)|charge]] is called nuclear potential energy; work of [[intermolecular forces]] is called intermolecular potential energy. Chemical potential energy, such as the energy stored in [[fossil fuels]], is the work of the Coulomb force during rearrangement of mutual positions of electrons and nuclei in atoms and molecules. Thermal energy usually has two components: the kinetic energy of random motions of particles and the potential energy of their mutual positions.

Forces derivable from a potential are also called [[conservative force]]s.  The work done by a conservative force is
:&lt;math&gt;\,W = -\Delta U&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the potential energy associated with the force. The negative sign provides the convention that work done against a force field increases potential energy, while work done by the force field decreases potential energy.  Common notations for potential energy are ''PE'', ''U'', ''V'', and ''E&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Potential energy is the energy by virtue of an object's position relative to other objects.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chemistry The Central Science|last = Brown|first = Theodore L.|publisher = Pearson Education, Inc.|year = 2006|isbn = 0-13-109686-9|location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|pages = 168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential energy is often associated with restoring [[force]]s such as a [[spring (device)|spring]] or the force of [[gravity]]. The action of stretching a spring or lifting a mass is performed by an external force that works against the force field of the potential.  This work is stored in the force field, which is said to be stored as potential energy.  If the external force is removed the force field acts on the body to perform the work as it moves the body back to the initial position, reducing the stretch of the spring or causing a body to fall.

Consider a ball whose mass is m and whose height is h. The acceleration g of free fall is approximately constant, so the weight force of the ball mg is constant. Force × displacement gives the work done, which is equal to the gravitational potential energy, thus

:&lt;math&gt;U_g = mgh&lt;/math&gt;

The more formal definition is that potential energy is the energy difference between the energy of an object in a given position and its energy at a reference position.

==Work and potential energy==
Potential energy is closely linked with [[force (physics)|forces]]. If the work done by a force on a body that moves from ''A'' to ''B'' does not depend on the path between these points (if the work is done by a conservative force), then the work of this force measured from ''A'' assigns a scalar value to every other point in space and defines a [[scalar potential]] field. In this case, the force can be defined as the negative of the [[gradient|vector gradient]] of the potential field.
&lt;!---too much detail
The work of a force acting on a moving body yields a difference in potential energy when the integration of the work is path independent.  The scalar product of a force '''F''' and the velocity '''v''' of its point of application defines  the [[power (physics)|power]] input to a system at an instant of time.  Integration of this power over the trajectory of the point of application, ''d''='''x'''(t), defines the work input to the system by the force. --&gt;

If the work for an applied force is independent of the path, then the work done by the force is evaluated at the start and end of the trajectory of the point of application.  This means that there is a function ''U''('''x'''), called a "potential," that can be evaluated at the two points '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points.  It is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential, that is 
:&lt;math&gt;W =\int_{C} \bold{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\bold{x} =  U(\mathbf{x}_A)-U(\mathbf{x}_B)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''C'' is the trajectory taken from A to B. Because the work done is independent of the path taken, then this expression is true for any trajectory, ''C'', from A to B.

The function ''U''('''x''') is called the potential energy associated with the applied force.  Examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces.

===Derivable from a potential===
In this section the relationship between work and potential energy is presented in more detail. The [[line integral]] that defines work along curve ''C'' takes a special form if the force '''F''' is related to a scalar field φ('''x''') so that
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}={\nabla \varphi} = \left ( \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial z} \right ). &lt;/math&gt;
In this case, work along the curve is given by
:&lt;math&gt;W =\int_{C} \bold{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\bold{x}=\int_{C} \nabla \varphi\cdot \mathrm{d}\bold{x},&lt;/math&gt;
which can be evaluated using the [[gradient theorem]] to obtain
:&lt;math&gt; W= \varphi(\mathbf{x}_B) - \varphi(\mathbf{x}_A).&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that when forces are derivable from a scalar field, the work of those forces along a curve ''C'' is computed by evaluating the scalar field at the start point ''A'' and the end point ''B'' of the curve.  This means the work integral does not depend on the path between ''A'' and ''B'' and is said to be independent of the path.

Potential energy ''U''=-φ('''x''') is traditionally defined as the negative of this scalar field so that work by the force field decreases potential energy, that is
:&lt;math&gt; W= U(\mathbf{x}_A) - U(\mathbf{x}_B).&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the application of the [[del operator]] to the work function yields,
:&lt;math&gt; {\nabla W} =  -{\nabla U} = -\left ( \frac{\partial U}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial U}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} \right ) = \mathbf{F},&lt;/math&gt;
and the force '''F''' is said to be "derivable from a potential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Robert Taylor|title=Classical Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1kCtNr-pJsC&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=2005|publisher=University Science Books|isbn=978-1-891389-22-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also necessarily implies that '''F''' must be a [[conservative vector field]].  The potential ''U'' defines a force '''F''' at every point '''x''' in space, so the set of forces is called a [[force field (physics)|force field]].

===Computing potential energy===
Given a force field '''F'''('''x'''), evaluation of the work integral using the [[gradient theorem]] can be used to find the scalar function associated with potential energy.  This is done by introducing a parameterized curve γ(t)='''r'''(t) from γ(a)=A to  γ(b)=B, and computing,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_{\gamma} \nabla\varphi(\mathbf{r})  \cdot  d\mathbf{r} &amp;=\int_a^b \nabla\varphi(\mathbf{r}(t))  \cdot  \mathbf{r}'(t)dt, \\
&amp;=\int_a^b \frac{d}{dt}\varphi(\mathbf{r}(t))dt =\varphi(\mathbf{r}(b))-\varphi(\mathbf{r}(a))=\varphi\left(\mathbf{x}_B\right)-\varphi\left(\mathbf{x}_A\right).
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

For the force field '''F''', let '''v'''= d'''r'''/dt, then the [[gradient theorem]] yields,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_{\gamma} \mathbf{F} \cdot  d\mathbf{r} &amp;=\int_a^b \mathbf{F}  \cdot  \mathbf{v}dt, \\
&amp;=-\int_a^b \frac{d}{dt}U(\mathbf{r}(t))dt =U\left(\mathbf{x}_A\right)- U\left(\mathbf{x}_B\right).
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

The power applied to a body by a force field is obtained from the gradient of the work, or potential, in the direction of the velocity '''v''' of the point of application, that is
:&lt;math&gt;P(t) = -{\nabla U} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;

Examples of work that can be computed from potential functions are gravity and spring forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Burton Paul|title=Kinematics and dynamics of planar machinery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3UdSAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=1979|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0-13-516062-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential energy for near Earth gravity==
[[File:Trebuchet.jpg|thumb|A [[trebuchet]] uses the gravitational potential energy of the [[counterweight]] to throw projectiles over two hundred metres]]

For small height changes, gravitational potential energy can be computed using

:&lt;math&gt;U_g=mgh,&lt;/math&gt;

where m is the mass in kg, g is the local gravitational field (9.8 metres per second squared on earth) and h is the height above a reference level in metres.

In classical physics, gravity exerts a constant downward force '''''F'''''=(0, 0, ''F&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') on the center of mass of a body moving near the surface of the Earth.  The work of gravity on a body moving along a trajectory '''''r'''''(t) = (''x''(t), ''y''(t), ''z''(t)), such as the track of a roller coaster is calculated using its velocity, '''''v'''''=(''v''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;), to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;W=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\boldsymbol{F}\cdot\boldsymbol{v}\mathrm{d}t = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}F_z v_z \mathrm{d}t = F_z\Delta z. &lt;/math&gt;
where the integral of the vertical component of velocity is the vertical distance.  Notice that the work of gravity depends only on the vertical movement of the curve '''''r'''''(t).

==Potential energy for a linear spring==
{{Main article|Elastic potential energy}}
[[File:Springs 009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Spring (device)|Springs]] are used for storing [[elastic potential energy]]]]
[[File:Longbowmen.jpg|thumb|right|[[Archery]] is one of humankind's oldest applications of elastic potential energy]]

A horizontal spring exerts a force '''F''' = (−''kx'', 0, 0) that is proportional to its deformation in the axial or ''x'' direction.  The work of this spring on a body moving along the space curve '''s'''(''t'') = (''x''(''t''), ''y''(''t''), ''z''(''t'')), is calculated using its velocity, '''v''' = (''v''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;), to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;W=\int_0^t\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v}\mathrm\,{d}t =-\int_0^t kx v_x \mathrm\,{d}t = -\frac{1}{2}kx^2. &lt;/math&gt;
For convenience, consider contact with the spring occurs at ''t'' = 0, then the integral of the product of the distance ''x'' and the ''x''-velocity, ''xv&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', is ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2.

The function 
:&lt;math&gt; U(x) = \frac{1}{2}kx^2,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--''U''(''x'')= 1/2 ''kx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;--&gt;
is called the potential energy of a linear spring.

Elastic potential energy is the potential energy of an [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] object (for example a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a catapult) that is deformed under tension or compression (or [[stress (physics)|stressed]] in formal terminology). It arises as a consequence of a force that tries to restore the object to its original shape, which is most often the [[electromagnetic force]] between the atoms and molecules that constitute the object. If the stretch is released, the energy is transformed into [[kinetic energy]].

==Potential energy for gravitational forces between two bodies==

The gravitational potential function, also known as [[gravitational potential energy]], is:
:&lt;math&gt; U=-\frac{GMm}{r}, &lt;/math&gt;

The negative sign follows the convention that work is gained from a loss of potential energy.

=== Derivation ===

The gravitational force between two bodies of mass ''M'' and ''m'' separated by a distance ''r'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=-\frac{GMm}{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of length 1 pointing from ''M'' to ''m'' and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].

Let the mass ''m'' move at the velocity '''v''' then the work of gravity on this mass as it moves from position '''r'''(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to  '''r'''(t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is given by
:&lt;math&gt; W=-\int^{\mathbf{r}(t_2)}_{\mathbf{r}(t_1)}\frac{GMm}{r^3}\mathbf{r}\cdot d\mathbf{r}=-\int^{t_2}_{t_1}\frac{GMm}{r^3}\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{v}\mathrm{d}t.&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that the position and velocity of the mass ''m'' are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = r\mathbf{e}_r, \qquad\mathbf{v}=\dot{r}\mathbf{e}_r + r\dot{\theta}\mathbf{e}_t,&lt;/math&gt;

where '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; are the radial and tangential unit vectors directed relative to the vector from ''M'' to ''m''.  Use this to simplify the formula for work of gravity to,

:&lt;math&gt; W=-\int^{t_2}_{t_1}\frac{GmM}{r^3}(r\mathbf{e}_r)\cdot(\dot{r}\mathbf{e}_r + r\dot{\theta}\mathbf{e}_t)\mathrm{d}t = -\int^{t_2}_{t_1}\frac{GmM}{r^3}r\dot{r}\mathrm{d}t = \frac{GMm}{r(t_2)}-\frac{GMm}{r(t_1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

This calculation uses the fact that
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}r^{-1}=-r^{-2}\dot{r}=-\frac{\dot{r}}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Potential energy for electrostatic forces between two bodies==
The electrostatic force exerted by a charge ''Q'' on another charge ''q'' separated by a distance ''r'' is given by [[Coulomb's Law]]

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{Qq}{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of length 1 pointing from ''Q'' to ''q'' and ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]]. This may also be written using [[Coulomb's constant]] {{nowrap|1=''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 ⁄ 4πε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The work ''W'' required to move ''q'' from ''A'' to any point ''B'' in the electrostatic force field is given by the potential function

:&lt;math&gt;U({r})=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{Qq}{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Reference level==
The potential energy is a function of the state a system is in, and is defined relative to that for a particular state. This reference state is not always a real state; it may also be a limit, such as with the distances between all bodies tending to infinity, provided that the energy involved in tending to that limit is finite, such as in the case of [[inverse-square law]] forces. Any arbitrary reference state could be used; therefore it can be chosen based on convenience.

Typically the potential energy of a system depends on the ''relative'' positions of its components only, so the reference state can also be expressed in terms of relative positions.

==Gravitational potential energy==
{{Main article|Gravitational potential|Gravitational energy|Gravity field}}

Gravitational energy is the potential energy associated with [[gravitational force]], as work is required to elevate objects against Earth's gravity. The potential energy due to elevated positions is called gravitational potential energy, and is evidenced by water in an elevated reservoir or kept behind a dam. If an object falls from one point to another point inside a gravitational field, the force of gravity will do positive work on the object, and the gravitational potential energy will decrease by the same amount.

[[File:Solar sys.jpg|right|thumb|Gravitational force keeps the planets in orbit around the [[Sun]]]]

Consider a book placed on top of a table. As the book is raised from the floor, to the table, some external force works against the gravitational force. If the book falls back to the floor, the "falling" energy the book receives is provided by the gravitational force. Thus, if the book falls off the table, this potential energy goes to accelerate the mass of the book and is converted into [[kinetic energy]]. When the book hits the floor this kinetic energy is converted into heat, deformation and sound by the impact.

The factors that affect an object's gravitational potential energy are its height relative to some reference point, its mass, and the strength of the gravitational field it is in. Thus, a book lying on a table has less gravitational potential energy than the same book on top of a taller cupboard, and less gravitational potential energy than a heavier book lying on the same table. An object at a certain height above the Moon's surface has less gravitational potential energy than at the same height above the Earth's surface because the Moon's gravity is weaker. Note that "height" in the common sense of the term cannot be used for gravitational potential energy calculations when gravity is not assumed to be a constant. The following sections provide more detail.

=== Local approximation ===
The strength of a gravitational field varies with location. However, when the change of distance is small in relation to the distances from the center of the source of the gravitational field, this variation in field strength is negligible and we can assume that the force of gravity on a particular object is constant. Near the surface of the Earth, for example, we assume that the acceleration due to gravity is a constant {{nowrap|1=''g'' = 9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} ("[[standard gravity]]"). In this case, a simple expression for gravitational potential energy can be derived using the ''W'' = ''Fd'' equation for [[mechanical work|work]], and the equation
:&lt;math&gt;W_F = -\Delta U_F.\!&lt;/math&gt;

The amount of gravitational potential energy held by an elevated object is equal to the work done against gravity in lifting it. The work done equals the force required to move it upward multiplied with the vertical distance it is moved (remember ''W = Fd''). The upward force required while moving at a constant velocity is equal to the weight, ''mg'', of an object, so the work done in lifting it through a height ''h'' is the product ''mgh''. Thus, when accounting only for [[mass]], [[Gravitation|gravity]], and [[altitude]], the equation is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Feynman, Richard P.|chapter=Work and potential energy|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. I|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|date=2011|isbn=978-0-465-02493-3|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDF-uoUmttUC&amp;pg=SA13-PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;U = mgh\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''U'' is the potential energy of the object relative to its being on the Earth's surface, ''m'' is the mass of the object, ''g'' is the acceleration due to gravity, and ''h'' is the altitude of the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/gpot.html|title=Hyperphysics - Gravitational Potential Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''m'' is expressed in [[kilogram]]s, ''g'' in [[metre per second squared|m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] and ''h'' in [[metre]]s then ''U'' will be calculated in [[joule]]s.

Hence, the potential difference is
:&lt;math&gt;\,\Delta U = mg \Delta h.\ &lt;/math&gt;

=== General formula ===
However, over large variations in distance, the approximation that ''g'' is constant is no longer valid, and we have to use [[calculus]] and the general mathematical definition of work to determine gravitational potential energy. For the computation of the potential energy we can [[integral|integrate]] the gravitational force, whose magnitude is given by [[Law of universal gravitation|Newton's law of gravitation]], with respect to the distance ''r'' between the two bodies. Using that definition, the gravitational potential energy of a system of masses ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at a distance ''r'' using [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' is

:&lt;math&gt;U = -G \frac{m_1 M_2}{r}\ + K&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''K'' is an arbitrary constant dependent on the choice of datum from which potential is measured. Choosing the convention that ''K''=0 (i.e. in relation to a point at infinity) makes calculations simpler, albeit at the cost of making ''U'' negative; for why this is physically reasonable, see below.

Given this formula for ''U'', the total potential energy of a system of ''n'' bodies is found by summing, for all &lt;math&gt;\frac{n ( n - 1 )}{2}&lt;/math&gt; pairs of two bodies, the potential energy of the system of those two bodies.

[[File:Gravitational potential summation 2.png|thumb|Gravitational potential summation &lt;math&gt;U = - m (G \frac{ M_1}{r_1}+ G \frac{ M_2}{r_2}) &lt;/math&gt;]]Considering the system of bodies as the combined set of small particles the bodies consist of, and applying the previous on the particle level we get the negative [[gravitational binding energy]]. This potential energy is more strongly negative than the total potential energy of the system of bodies as such since it also includes the negative gravitational binding energy of each body. The potential energy of the system of bodies as such is the negative of the energy needed to separate the bodies from each other to infinity, while the gravitational binding energy is the energy needed to separate all particles from each other to infinity.
:&lt;math&gt;U = - m \left(G \frac{ M_1}{r_1}+ G \frac{ M_2}{r_2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;U = - m  \sum G \frac{ M}{r}  &lt;/math&gt;,

===Negative gravitational energy===
As with all potential energies, only differences in gravitational potential energy matter for most physical purposes, and the choice of zero point is arbitrary. Given that there is no reasonable criterion for preferring one particular finite ''r'' over another, there seem to be only two reasonable choices for the distance at which ''U'' becomes zero: &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r=\infty&lt;/math&gt;. The choice of &lt;math&gt;U=0&lt;/math&gt; at infinity may seem peculiar, and the consequence that gravitational energy is always negative may seem counterintuitive, but this choice allows gravitational potential energy values to be finite, albeit negative.

The [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] at &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt; in the formula for gravitational potential energy means that the only other apparently reasonable alternative choice of convention, with &lt;math&gt;U=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt;, would result in potential energy being positive, but infinitely large for all nonzero values of ''r'', and would make calculations involving sums or differences of potential energies beyond what is possible with the [[real number]] system. Since physicists abhor infinities in their calculations, and ''r'' is always non-zero in practice, the choice of &lt;math&gt;U=0&lt;/math&gt; at infinity is by far the more preferable choice, even if the idea of negative energy in a [[gravity well]] appears to be peculiar at first.

The negative value for gravitational energy also has deeper implications that make it seem more reasonable in cosmological calculations where the total energy of the universe can meaningfully be considered; see [[inflation theory]] for more on this.

Gravitational potential energy has a number of practical uses, notably the generation of [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]]. For example, in [[Dinorwig Power Station|Dinorwig]], Wales, there are two lakes, one at a higher elevation than the other. At times when surplus electricity is not required (and so is comparatively cheap), water is pumped up to the higher lake, thus converting the electrical energy (running the pump) to gravitational potential energy. At times of peak demand for electricity, the water flows back down through electrical generator turbines, converting the potential energy into kinetic energy and then back into electricity. The process is not completely efficient and some of the original energy from the surplus electricity is in fact lost to friction.&lt;ref name=EconomistPSH&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21548495?frsc=dg%7Ca|title=Energy storage - Packing some power|work=[[The Economist]]|date=2011-03-03|accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thier&gt;Jacob, Thierry.[http://www.stucky.ch/en/contenu/pdf/Pumped_storage_in_Switzerland_Dr_Jacob.pdf Pumped storage in Switzerland - an outlook beyond 2000] ''Stucky''.

Gravitational potential energy is also used to power clocks in which falling weights operate the mechanism.{{clear right}}  It's also used by [[counterweight]]s for lifting up an [[elevator]], crane, or [[sash window]].
[[Rollercoasters|Roller coasters]] are an entertaining way to utilize potential energy - chains are used to move a car up an incline (building up gravitational potential energy), to then have that energy converted into kinetic energy as it falls.

Another practical use is utilizing gravitational potential energy to descend (perhaps coast) downhill in transportation such as the descent of an automobile, truck, railroad train, bicycle, airplane, or fluid in a pipeline.  In some cases the [[kinetic energy]] obtained from potential energy of descent may be used to start ascending the next grade such as what happens when a road is undulating and has frequent dips. The commercialization of stored energy (in the form of rail cars raised to higher elevations) that is then converted to electrical energy when needed by an electrical grid, is being undertaken in the United States in a system called [[List of energy storage projects#Gravitational potential energy storage|Advanced Rail Energy Storage]] (ARES).&lt;ref name="Economist-2012.03.03"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/21548495 Packing Some Power: Energy Technology: Better ways of storing energy are needed if electricity systems are to become cleaner and more efficient], ''[[The Economist]]'', 3 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg-2012.09.06"&gt;Downing, Louise.

&lt;!--moved up to another section --==Elastic potential energy== ----&gt;
&lt;!--duplicates information presented above------
===Calculation of elastic potential energy===
The elastic potential energy stored in a stretched spring can be calculated by finding the work necessary to stretch the spring a distance x from its un-stretched length:

:&lt;math&gt;U = -\int\vec{F}\cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{x} &lt;/math&gt;

an ideal spring will follow [[Hooke's Law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;F=-k \Delta x\,&lt;/math&gt;

The work done (and therefore the stored potential energy) will then be:

:&lt;math&gt;U = -\int\vec{F}\cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{x}=-\int {-k x}\, \mathrm{d}x = \frac {1} {2} k x^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The units are in joules (J).

The equation is often used in calculations of positions of [[mechanical equilibrium]]. This equation can also be stated as:

:&lt;math&gt; U = \frac{1}{2}k \Delta x^2\,&lt;/math&gt;
-------------&gt;

==Chemical potential energy==
{{Main article|Chemical energy}}
Chemical potential energy is a form of potential energy related to the structural arrangement of atoms or molecules. This arrangement may be the result of [[chemical bond]]s within a molecule or otherwise. Chemical energy of a chemical substance can be transformed to other forms of energy by a [[chemical reaction]]. As an example, when a fuel is burned the chemical energy is converted to heat, same is the case with digestion of food metabolized in a biological organism. Green plants transform [[solar energy]] to chemical energy through the process known as [[photosynthesis]], and electrical energy can be converted to chemical energy through [[electrochemical]] reactions.

The similar term [[chemical potential]] is used to indicate the potential of a substance to undergo a change of configuration, be it in the form of a chemical reaction, spatial transport, particle exchange with a reservoir, etc.

==Electric potential energy==
{{Main article|Electric potential energy}}
An object can have potential energy by virtue of its [[electric charge]] and several forces related to their presence. There are two main types of this kind of potential energy: electrostatic potential energy, electrodynamic potential energy (also sometimes called magnetic potential energy).

[[File:Plasma-lamp 2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] formed inside a gas filled sphere]]

===Electrostatic potential energy===
Electrostatic potential energy between two bodies in space is obtained from the force exerted by a charge ''Q'' on another charge ''q'' which is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_{e}=-\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{Qq}{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of length 1 pointing from ''Q'' to ''q'' and ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]]. This may also be written using [[Coulomb's constant]] {{nowrap|1=''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 ⁄ 4πε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

If the electric charge of an object can be assumed to be at rest, then it has potential energy due to its position relative to other charged objects.  The [[electric potential energy|electrostatic potential energy]] is the energy of an electrically charged particle (at rest) in an electric field. It is defined as the [[work (physics)|work]] that must be done to move it from an infinite distance away to its present location, adjusted for non-electrical forces on the object. This energy will generally be non-zero if there is another electrically charged object nearby.

The work ''W'' required to move ''q'' from ''A'' to any point ''B'' in the electrostatic force field is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U_{AB}({\bold{r}})=-\int_{A}^{B} \bold{F_e} \cdot d\bold{r} &lt;/math&gt;
typically given in ''J'' for Joules. A related quantity called ''[[electric potential]]'' (commonly denoted with a ''V'' for voltage) is equal to the electric potential energy per unit charge.

===Magnetic potential energy===
The energy of a [[magnetic moment]] &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; in an externally produced [[Magnetic field|magnetic B-field]] {{math|'''B'''}} has potential energy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aharoni|first=Amikam|title=Introduction to the theory of ferromagnetism|date=1996|publisher=Clarendon Pr.|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-851791-2|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;U=-\boldsymbol{\mu}\cdot\mathbf{B}. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[magnetization]] {{math|'''M'''}} in a field is

:&lt;math&gt; U = -\frac{1}{2}\int \mathbf{M}\cdot\mathbf{B} \mathrm{d}V, &lt;/math&gt;

where the integral can be over all space or, equivalently, where {{math|'''M'''}} is nonzero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=John David|author-link=John David Jackson (physicist) |title=Classical electrodynamics|date=1975|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=0-471-43132-X|edition=2d}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Magnetic potential energy is the form of energy related not only to the distance between magnetic materials, but also to the orientation, or alignment, of those materials within the field. For example, the needle of a compass has the lowest magnetic potential energy when it is aligned with the north and south poles of the Earth's magnetic field. If the needle is moved by an outside force, torque is exerted on the magnetic dipole of the needle by the Earth's magnetic field, causing it to move back into alignment. The magnetic potential energy of the needle is highest when its field is in the same direction as the Earth's magnetic field. Two magnets will have potential energy in relation to each other and the distance between them, but this also depends on their orientation. If the opposite poles are held apart, the potential energy will be higher the further they are apart and lower the closer they are. Conversely, like poles will have the highest potential energy when forced together, and the lowest when they spring apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James D.|last=Livingston|title=Rising Force: The Magic of Magnetic Levitation|publisher=[[President and Fellows of Harvard College]]|date=2011|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Narinder|last=Kumar|title=Comprehensive Physics XII|publisher=Laxmi Publications|date=2004|page=713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear potential energy==&lt;!--[[Nuclear potential energy]] redirects here--&gt;
Nuclear potential energy is the potential energy of the [[nuclear particles|particles]] inside an [[atomic nucleus]]. The nuclear particles are bound together by the [[strong nuclear force]]. [[Weak nuclear force]]s provide the potential energy for certain kinds of radioactive decay, such as [[beta decay]].

Nuclear particles like protons and neutrons are not destroyed in fission and fusion processes, but collections of them can have less mass than if they were individually free, in which case this mass difference can be liberated as heat and radiation in nuclear reactions (the heat and radiation have the missing mass, but it often escapes from the system, where it is not measured). The energy from the [[Sun]] is an example of this form of energy conversion. In the Sun, the process of hydrogen fusion converts about 4 million tonnes of solar matter per second into [[electromagnetic energy]], which is radiated into space.

==Forces and potential energy==
Potential energy is closely linked with [[force (physics)|forces]]. If the work done by a force on a body that moves from ''A'' to ''B'' does not depend on the path between these points, then the work of this force measured from ''A'' assigns a scalar value to every other point in space and defines a [[scalar potential]] field. In this case, the force can be defined as the negative of the [[gradient|vector gradient]] of the potential field.

For example, gravity is a [[conservative force]]. The associated potential is the [[gravitational potential]], often denoted by &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the energy per unit mass as a function of position. The gravitational potential energy of two particles of mass ''M'' and ''m'' separated by a distance ''r'' is
:&lt;math&gt;U = -\frac{G M m}{r},&lt;/math&gt;
The gravitational potential ([[specific orbital energy|specific energy]]) of the two bodies is
:&lt;math&gt;\phi = -\left( \frac{GM}{r} + \frac{Gm}{r} \right)= -\frac{G(M+m)}{r} = -\frac{GMm}{\mu r} = \frac{U}{\mu}.&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced mass]].

The work done against gravity by moving an [[test particle|infinitesimal mass]] from point A with &lt;math&gt;U = a&lt;/math&gt; to point B with &lt;math&gt;U = b&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(b - a)&lt;/math&gt; and the work done going back the other way is &lt;math&gt;(a - b)&lt;/math&gt; so that the total work done in moving from A to B and returning to A is
: &lt;math&gt;U_{A \to B \to A} = (b - a) + (a - b) = 0. \,&lt;/math&gt;
If the potential is redefined at A to be &lt;math&gt;a + c&lt;/math&gt; and the potential at B to be &lt;math&gt;b + c&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a constant (i.e. &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; can be any number, positive or negative, but it must be the same at A as it is at B) then the work done going from A to B is
: &lt;math&gt;U_{A \to B} = (b + c) - (a + c) = b - a \,&lt;/math&gt;
as before.

In practical terms, this means that one can set the zero of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; anywhere one likes. One may set it to be zero at the surface of the [[Earth]], or may find it more convenient to set zero at infinity (as in the expressions given earlier in this section).
&lt;!---this is repetitive and poorly written---
A thing to note about conservative forces is that the work done going from A to B does not depend on the route taken. If it did then it would be pointless to define a potential at each point in space. An example of a non-conservative force is friction. With friction, the route taken does affect the amount of work done, and it makes little sense to define a potential associated with friction.

All the examples above are actually force field stored energy (sometimes in disguise). For example in elastic potential energy, stretching an elastic material forces the atoms very slightly further apart. The equilibrium between [[electromagnetic force]]s and [[Pauli repulsion]] of electrons (they are [[fermions]] obeying [[Fermi statistics]]) is slightly violated resulting in a small returning force. Scientists rarely discuss forces on an [[atom]]ic scale. Often interactions are described in terms of energy rather than force. One may think of potential energy as being derived from force or think of force as being derived from potential energy (though the latter approach requires a definition of energy that is independent from force which does not currently exist).
----&gt;

A conservative force can be expressed in the language of [[differential geometry]] as a [[closed differential form|closed form]]. As Euclidean space is [[contractible space|contractible]], its [[de Rham cohomology]] vanishes, so every closed form is also an [[exact differential form|exact form]], and can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar field. This gives a mathematical justification of the fact that all conservative forces are gradients of a potential field.

'''Samarium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Sm''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;62. It is a moderately hard silvery [[metal]] that slowly oxidizes in air. Being a typical member of the [[lanthanide]] series, samarium usually assumes the [[oxidation state]] +3. Compounds of samarium(II) are also known, most notably the [[monoxide]] SmO, [[samarium monochalcogenides|monochalcogenides]] SmS, SmSe and SmTe, as well as [[samarium(II) iodide]]. The last compound is a common [[reducing agent]] in [[chemical synthesis]]. Samarium has no significant biological role but is only slightly toxic.

Samarium was discovered in 1879 by the French chemist [[Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]] and named after the mineral [[samarskite]] from which it was isolated. The mineral itself was earlier named after a Russian mine official, Colonel [[Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets]], who thereby became the first person to have a chemical element named after him, albeit indirectly. Although classified as a [[rare-earth element]], samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and is more common than such metals as [[tin]]. Samarium occurs with concentration up to 2.8% in several minerals including [[cerite]], [[gadolinite]], samarskite, [[monazite]] and [[bastnäsite]], the last two being the most common commercial sources of the element. These minerals are mostly found in China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia; China is by far the world leader in samarium mining and production.

The major commercial application of samarium is in [[samarium–cobalt magnet]]s, which have [[Magnet|permanent magnetization]] second only to [[neodymium magnet]]s; however, samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures, above {{convert|700|C|F}}, without losing their magnetic properties, due to the alloy's higher [[Curie temperature|Curie point]]. The radioactive [[isotope]] [[samarium-153]] is the active component of the drug [[samarium (153Sm) lexidronam|samarium (&lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Sm) lexidronam]] (Quadramet), which kills cancer cells in the treatment of [[lung cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], [[breast cancer]] and [[osteosarcoma]]. Another isotope, [[samarium-149]], is a strong [[neutron]] absorber and is therefore added to the [[control rod]]s of [[nuclear reactor]]s. It is also formed as a decay product during the reactor operation and is one of the important factors considered in the reactor design and operation. Other applications of samarium include [[catalysis]] of [[chemical reaction]]s, [[samarium–neodymium dating|radioactive dating]] and an [[X-ray laser]].

==Physical properties==
Samarium is a [[Rare earth element|rare earth metal]] having a hardness and density similar to those of [[zinc]]. With the boiling point of 1794&amp;nbsp;°C, samarium is the third most volatile lanthanide after [[ytterbium]] and [[europium]]; this property facilitates separation of samarium from the mineral ore. At ambient conditions, samarium normally assumes a [[rhombohedral]] structure (α form). Upon heating to 731&amp;nbsp;°C, its crystal symmetry changes into [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonally close-packed]] (''hcp''), however the transition temperature depends on the metal purity. Further heating to 922&amp;nbsp;°C transforms the metal into a [[Cubic crystal system|body-centered cubic]] (''bcc'') phase. Heating to 300&amp;nbsp;°C combined with compression to 40&amp;nbsp;[[bar (unit)|kbar]] results in a double-hexagonally close-packed structure (''dhcp''). Applying higher pressure of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilobars induces a series of phase transformations, in particular with a [[tetragonal crystal system|tetragonal]] phase appearing at about 900&amp;nbsp;kbar.&lt;ref name=sm/&gt; In one study, the ''dhcp'' phase could be produced without compression, using a nonequilibrium annealing regime with a rapid temperature change between about 400 and 700&amp;nbsp;°C, confirming the transient character of this samarium phase. Also, thin films of samarium obtained by vapor deposition may contain the ''hcp'' or ''dhcp'' phases at ambient conditions.&lt;ref name=sm/&gt;

Samarium (and its [[sesquioxide]]) are [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] at room temperature. Their corresponding effective magnetic moments, below 2[[Bohr magneton|µ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;]], are the 3rd lowest among the lanthanides (and their oxides) after lanthanum and lutetium. The metal transforms to an [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] state upon cooling to 14.8&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Lock|first1=J.

==Chemical properties==
Freshly prepared samarium has a silvery luster. In air, it slowly oxidizes at room temperature and spontaneously ignites at 150&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt;&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Even when stored under [[mineral oil]], samarium gradually oxidizes and develops a grayish-yellow powder of the [[oxide]]-[[hydroxide]] mixture at the surface. The metallic appearance of a sample can be preserved by sealing it under an inert gas such as [[argon]].

Samarium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form samarium hydroxide:&lt;ref name=we/&gt;
:2 Sm (s) + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) → 2 Sm(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)

Samarium dissolves readily in dilute [[sulfuric acid]] to form solutions containing the yellow&lt;ref name=g1243&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 1243&lt;/ref&gt; to pale green Sm(III) ions, which exist as [Sm(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes:&lt;ref name=we&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.webelements.com/samarium/chemistry.html| title =Chemical reactions of Samarium| publisher=Webelements| accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 Sm (s) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) → 2 Sm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + 3 SO{{su|b=4|p=2−}} (aq) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)

Samarium is one of the few lanthanides that exhibit the oxidation state +2. The Sm&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are blood-red in aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=g1248&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 1248&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxides===
The most stable oxide of samarium is the [[sesquioxide]] Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. As many other samarium compounds, it exists in several crystalline phases. The trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from the melt. The melting point of Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is rather high (2345&amp;nbsp;°C) and therefore melting is usually achieved not by direct heating, but with [[induction heating]], through a radio-frequency coil. The Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by the flame fusion method ([[Verneuil process]]) from the Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; powder, that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter. The boules are transparent when pure and defect-free and are orange otherwise. Heating the metastable trigonal Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to 1900&amp;nbsp;°C converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase.&lt;ref name=smo/&gt; Cubic Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has also been described.&lt;ref name=smo2/&gt;

Samarium is one of the few lanthanides that form a monoxide, SmO. This lustrous golden-yellow compound was obtained by reducing Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with samarium metal at elevated temperature (1000&amp;nbsp;°C) and pressure above 50&amp;nbsp;kbar; lowering the pressure resulted in an incomplete reaction. SmO has the cubic rock-salt lattice structure.&lt;ref name=smox/&gt;&lt;ref name=g1239&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 1239&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chalcogenides===
{{see also|Samarium monochalcogenides}}
Samarium forms trivalent [[samarium(III) sulfide|sulfide]], [[selenide]] and [[telluride (chemistry)|telluride]]. Divalent chalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe with cubic rock-salt crystal structure are also known. They are remarkable by converting from semiconducting to metallic state at room temperature upon application of pressure. Whereas the transition is continuous and occurs at about 20–30&amp;nbsp;kbar in SmSe and SmTe, it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6.5&amp;nbsp;kbar. This effect results in spectacular color change in SmS from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished. The transition does not change lattice symmetry, but there is a sharp decrease (~15%) in the crystal volume.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Beaurepaire, Eric (Ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=rGDCn4lqmdsC&amp;pg=PA393 ''Magnetism: a synchrotron radiation approach''], Springer, 2006 {{ISBN|3-540-33241-3}} p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; It shows hysteresis, that is when the pressure is released, SmS returns to the semiconducting state at much lower pressure of about 0.4 kbar.&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jayaraman|first1=A.|last2=Narayanamurti|first2=V.|last3=Bucher|first3=E.|last4=Maines|first4=R.|title=Continuous and Discontinuous Semiconductor-Metal Transition in Samarium Monochalcogenides Under Pressure|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=25|page=1430|date=1970|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.25.1430|bibcode=1970PhRvL..25.1430J|issue=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halides===
Samarium metal reacts with all the [[halogen]]s, forming trihalides:&lt;ref name=g1236&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], pp. 1236, 1241&lt;/ref&gt;
:2 Sm (s) + 3 X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 SmX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) (X = F, Cl, Br or I)

Their further reduction with samarium, lithium or sodium metals at elevated temperatures (about 700–900&amp;nbsp;°C) yields dihalides.&lt;ref name=smcl2/&gt; The diiodide can also be prepared by heating SmI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, or by reacting the metal with [[1,2-Diiodoethane|1,2-diiodoethane]] in anhydrous [[tetrahydrofuran]] at room temperature:&lt;ref name=g1240&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 1240&lt;/ref&gt;
:Sm (s) + ICH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I → SmI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

In addition to dihalides, the reduction also produces numerous [[Non-stoichiometric compound|non-stoichiometric]] samarium halides with a well-defined crystal structure, such as Sm&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, Sm&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;, Sm&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;64&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref name=smf2/&gt; Sm&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;, Sm&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; and Sm&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baernighausen|first1=H.|last2=Haschke|first2=John M.|title=Compositions and crystal structures of the intermediate phases in the samarium-bromine system|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|volume=17|page=18|date=1978|doi=10.1021/ic50179a005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As reflected in the table above, samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another, which is an uncommon behavior for most elements (e.g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beck|first1=H.

===Borides===
[[Sintering]] powders of samarium oxide and boron, in vacuum, yields a powder containing several samarium boride phases, and their volume ratio can be controlled through the mixing proportion.&lt;ref name=smb6b/&gt; The powder can be converted into larger crystals of a certain samarium boride using [[Electric arc furnace|arc melting]] or [[zone melting]] techniques, relying on the different melting/crystallization temperature of SmB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (2580&amp;nbsp;°C), SmB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (about 2300&amp;nbsp;°C) and SmB&lt;sub&gt;66&lt;/sub&gt; (2150&amp;nbsp;°C). All these materials are hard, brittle, dark-gray solids with the hardness increasing with the boron content.&lt;ref name=smb6/&gt; Samarium diboride is too volatile to be produced with these methods and requires high pressure (about 65 kbar) and low temperatures between 1140 and 1240&amp;nbsp;°C to stabilize its growth. Increasing the temperature results in the preferential formations of SmB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=smb2/&gt;

====Samarium hexaboride====
Samarium hexaboride is a typical intermediate-valence compound where samarium is present both as Sm&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Sm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions at the ratio 3:7.&lt;ref name=smb6b&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nickerson|first1=J.|last2=White|first2=R.|last3=Lee|first3=K.|last4=Bachmann|first4=R.|last5=Geballe|first5=T.|last6=Hull|first6=G.|title=Physical Properties of SmB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=Physical Review B|volume=3|page=2030|date=1971|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.3.2030|issue=6|bibcode = 1971PhRvB...3.2030N }}&lt;/ref&gt; It belongs to a class of [[Kondo insulator]]s, that is at high temperatures (above 50&amp;nbsp;K), its properties are typical of a Kondo metal, with metallic electrical conductivity characterized by strong electron scattering, whereas at low temperatures, it behaves as a non-magnetic insulator with a narrow [[band gap]] of about 4–14&amp;nbsp;meV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.52.R14308|last1=Nyhus|date=1995|first1=P.|pages=R14308|volume=52|last2=Cooper|journal=Physical Review B|first2=S.|last3=Fisk|first3=Z.|last4=Sarrao|first4=J.|title=Light scattering from gap excitations and bound states in SmB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; |issue=20|bibcode = 1995PhRvB..5214308N }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cooling-induced metal-insulator transition in SmB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is accompanied by a sharp increase in the [[thermal conductivity]], peaking at about 15&amp;nbsp;K. The reason for this increase is that electrons themselves do not contribute to the thermal conductivity at low temperatures, which is dominated by [[phonon]]s, but the decrease in electron concentration reduced the rate of electron-phonon scattering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sera|first1=M.|last2=Kobayashi|first2=S.|last3=Hiroi|first3=M.|last4=Kobayashi|first4=N.|last5=Kunii|first5=S.|title=Thermal conductivity of RB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (R=Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd) single crystals |journal=Physical Review B |volume=54 |page=R5207 |date=1996 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.54.R5207 |issue=8 |bibcode=1996PhRvB..54.5207S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other inorganic compounds===
[[File:Samarium-sulfate.jpg|thumb|upright|Samarium sulfate, Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]
Samarium [[carbide]]s are prepared by melting a graphite-metal mixture in an inert atmosphere. After the synthesis, they are unstable in air and are studied also under inert atmosphere.&lt;ref name=smc/&gt; Samarium monophosphide SmP is a [[semiconductor]] with the bandgap of 1.10&amp;nbsp;eV, the same as in [[silicon]], and high electrical conductivity of [[N-type semiconductor|n-type]]. It can be prepared by annealing at 1100&amp;nbsp;°C an evacuated quartz ampoule containing mixed powders of phosphorus and samarium. Phosphorus is highly volatile at high temperatures and may explode, thus the heating rate has to be kept well below 1&amp;nbsp;°C/min.&lt;ref name=smp/&gt; Similar procedure is adopted for the monarsenide SmAs, but the synthesis temperature is higher at 1800&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=smas/&gt;

Numerous crystalline binary compounds are known for samarium and one of the group-14, 15 or 16 element X, where X is Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb or Te, and metallic alloys of samarium form another large group. They are all prepared by annealing mixed powders of the corresponding elements. Many of the resulting compounds are non-stoichiometric and have nominal compositions Sm&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, where the b/a ratio varies between 0.5 and 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gladyshevskii|first1=E.

===Organometallic compounds===
Samarium forms a [[Cyclopentadiene|cyclopentadienide]] Sm(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and its chloroderivatives Sm(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl and Sm(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. They are prepared by reacting samarium trichloride with NaC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; in [[tetrahydrofuran]]. Contrary to cyclopentadienides of most other lanthanides, in Sm(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; some C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; rings bridge each other by forming ring vertexes η&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; or edges η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; toward another neighboring samarium atom, thereby creating polymeric chains.&lt;ref name=g1248/&gt; The chloroderivative Sm(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl has a dimer structure, which is more accurately expressed as (η&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sm(µ-Cl)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(η&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. There, the chlorine bridges can be replaced, for instance, by iodine, hydrogen or nitrogen atoms or by CN groups.&lt;ref name=g1249&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 1249&lt;/ref&gt;

The (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion in samarium cyclopentadienides can be replaced by the indenide (C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or [[Cyclooctatetraene|cyclooctatetraenide]] (C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ring, resulting in Sm(C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or KSm(η&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The latter compound has a similar structure to that of [[uranocene]]. There is also a cyclopentadienide of divalent samarium, Sm(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – a solid that sublimates at about 85&amp;nbsp;°C.

==Isotopes==
{{main|Isotopes of samarium}}
Naturally occurring samarium has a [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]] of 128&amp;nbsp;[[becquerel|Bq]]/g. It is composed of four stable [[isotope]]s: &lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;Sm, &lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;Sm, &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Sm and &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Sm, and three extremely long-lived [[radioisotope]]s, &lt;sup&gt;147&lt;/sup&gt;Sm (half-life ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.06{{e|11}} years), &lt;sup&gt;148&lt;/sup&gt;Sm (7{{e|15}} years) and &lt;sup&gt;149&lt;/sup&gt;Sm (&gt;2{{e|15}} years), with &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Sm being the most abundant ([[natural abundance]] 26.75%).&lt;ref name="nubase"/&gt; &lt;sup&gt;149&lt;/sup&gt;Sm is listed by various sources either as stable&lt;ref name="nubase"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/reCenter.jsp?z=62&amp;n=87 Chart of the nuclides], Brookhaven National Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt; or radioactive isotope.&lt;ref&gt;Holden, Norman E. "Table of the isotopes" in {{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-lived isotopes,&lt;sup&gt;146&lt;/sup&gt;Sm, &lt;sup&gt;147&lt;/sup&gt;Sm, and &lt;sup&gt;148&lt;/sup&gt;Sm, primarily decay by emission of [[alpha decay|alpha particles]] to isotopes of [[neodymium]]. Lighter unstable isotopes of samarium primarily decay by [[electron capture]] to isotopes of [[promethium]], while heavier ones convert through [[beta decay]] to isotopes of [[europium]].&lt;ref name="nubase"/&gt;

The [[alpha decay]] of &lt;sup&gt;147&lt;/sup&gt;Sm to &lt;sup&gt;143&lt;/sup&gt;Nd with a [[half-life]] of 1.06{{e|11}} years serve for [[samarium–neodymium dating]].

The half-lives of [[Samarium-151|&lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;Sm]] and &lt;sup&gt;145&lt;/sup&gt;Sm are 90 years and 340 days, respectively. All the remaining [[radioisotopes]] have half-lives that are less than 2 days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 48 seconds. Samarium also has five [[nuclear isomer]]s with the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;141m&lt;/sup&gt;Sm ([[half-life]] 22.6 minutes), &lt;sup&gt;143m1&lt;/sup&gt;Sm (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 66 seconds) and &lt;sup&gt;139m&lt;/sup&gt;Sm (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 10.7 seconds).&lt;ref name="nubase"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audi|first1=G.|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|title=The NUBASE evaluation of nuclear and decay properties|date=2003|page=3|volume=729|journal=Nuclear Physics A|url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A|last2=Bersillon|first2=O.|last3=Blachot|first3=J.|last4=Wapstra|first4=A.

Detection of samarium and related elements was announced by several scientists in the second half of the 19th century; however, most sources give the priority to the [[France|French]] chemist [[Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 1229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brit&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/520309/samarium Samarium], Encyclopædia Britannica on-line&lt;/ref&gt; Boisbaudran isolated samarium oxide and/or hydroxide in [[Paris]] in 1879 from the mineral [[samarskite]] ((Y,Ce,U,Fe)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(Nb,Ta,Ti)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;) and identified a new element in it via sharp optical absorption lines.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book| first=C.

In particular, it was found that the samarium isolated by Boisbaudran was also impure and contained comparable amount of [[europium]]. The pure element was produced only in 1901 by [[Eugène-Anatole Demarçay]].&lt;ref name=van/&gt;

Boisbaudran named his element ''samaria'' after the mineral samarskite, which in turn honored [[Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets]] (1803–1870). Samarsky-Bykhovets, as the Chief of Staff of the [[Russia]]n Corps of Mining Engineers, had granted access for two German mineralogists, the brothers [[Gustav Rose]] and [[Heinrich Rose]], to study the mineral samples from the Urals.&lt;ref name=bse&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article099149.html Samarskite], [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3046j/f214.pagination|first= Lecoq de|last= Boisbaudran|title= Recherches sur le samarium, radical d'une terre nouvelle extraite de la samarskite|journal= Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences|volume= 89|date= 1879|pages= 212–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shipley, Joseph Twadell.

Prior to the advent of [[ion-exchange]] separation technology in the 1950s, samarium had no commercial uses in pure form. However, a by-product of the fractional crystallization purification of neodymium was a mixture of samarium and gadolinium that acquired the name of "Lindsay Mix" after the company that made it. This material is thought to have been used for nuclear [[control rod]]s in some early nuclear reactors. Nowadays, a similar commodity product has the name "samarium-europium-[[gadolinium]]" (SEG) concentrate.&lt;ref name=RSC&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/podcast/Interactive_Periodic_Table_Transcripts/Samarium.asp Chemistry in Its Element – Samarium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408195843/http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/podcast/Interactive_Periodic_Table_Transcripts/Samarium.asp |date=2011-04-08 }}, Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/ref&gt; It is prepared by solvent extraction from the mixed [[lanthanide]]s isolated from bastnäsite (or monazite). Since the heavier lanthanides have the greater affinity for the solvent used, they are easily extracted from the bulk using relatively small proportions of solvent. Not all rare-earth producers who process bastnäsite do so on a large enough scale to continue onward with the separation of the components of SEG, which typically makes up only one or two percent of the original ore. Such producers will therefore be making SEG with a view to marketing it to the specialized processors. In this manner, the valuable europium content of the ore is rescued for use in [[phosphor]] manufacture. Samarium purification follows the removal of the europium. {{As of | 2012}}, being in oversupply, samarium oxide is less expensive on a commercial scale than its relative abundance in the ore might suggest.&lt;ref name=price/&gt;

==Occurrence and production==
[[File:Samarskite-fresh.jpg|thumb|Samarskite]]
With the average concentration of about 8 parts per million (ppm), samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust. It is the fifth most abundant lanthanide and is more common than elements such as tin. Samarium concentration in soils varies between 2 and 23&amp;nbsp;ppm, and oceans contain about 0.5–0.8&amp;nbsp;parts per trillion.&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt; Distribution of samarium in soils strongly depends on its chemical state and is very inhomogeneous: in sandy soils, samarium concentration is about 200 times higher at the surface of soil particles than in the water trapped between them, and this ratio can exceed 1,000 in clays.&lt;ref name=LA2/&gt;

Samarium is not found free in nature, but, like other rare earth elements, is contained in many minerals, including [[monazite]], [[bastnäsite]], [[cerite]], [[gadolinite]] and [[samarskite]]; monazite (in which samarium occurs at concentrations of up to 2.8%)&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; and bastnäsite are mostly used as commercial sources. World resources of samarium are estimated at two million [[tonne]]s; they are mostly located in China, US, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia, and the annual production is about 700 tonnes.&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt; Country production reports are usually given for all rare-earth metals combined. By far, China has the largest production with 120,000 tonnes mined per year; it is followed by the US (about 5,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes)&lt;ref name=LA2/&gt; and India (2,700&amp;nbsp;tonnes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/rare_earths/mcs-2010-raree.pdf|title= Rare Earths|publisher= United States Geological Surves|date =January 2010|accessdate= 2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samarium is usually sold as oxide, which at the price of about 30&amp;nbsp;USD/kg is one of the cheapest lanthanide oxides.&lt;ref name=price&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121014122537/http://lynascorp.com/page.asp?category_id=1&amp;page_id=25 What are their prices?], Lynas corp.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas [[mischmetal]] – a mixture of rare earth metals containing about 1% of samarium – has long been used, relatively pure samarium has been isolated only recently, through [[ion exchange]] processes, [[solvent extraction]] techniques, and [[electrochemical deposition]]. The metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of [[samarium(III) chloride]] with [[sodium chloride]] or [[calcium chloride]]. Samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with [[lanthanum]]. The product is then distilled to separate samarium (boiling point 1794&amp;nbsp;°C) and lanthanum (b.p.&amp;nbsp;3464&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

Domination of samarium in minerals is unique. Minerals with essential (dominant) samarium include [[monazite-(Sm)]] and [[florencite-(Sm)]]. They are very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Masau, M., Černý, P., Cooper, M.A., and Chapman, R., 2002.

Samarium-151 is produced in [[nuclear fission]] of [[uranium]] with the yield of about
0.4% of the total number of fission events. It is also synthesized upon [[neutron capture]] by samarium-149, which is added to the [[control rod]]s of nuclear reactors. Consequently, samarium-151 is present in spent [[nuclear fuel]] and radioactive waste.&lt;ref name=LA2/&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Samariumiodide.jpg|thumb|[[Barbier reaction]] using SmI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
One of the most important applications of samarium is in [[samarium–cobalt magnet]]s, which have a nominal composition of SmCo&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; or Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;. They have high permanent magnetization, which is about 10,000 times that of iron and is second only to that of [[neodymium magnet]]s. However, samarium-based magnets have higher resistance to demagnetization, as they are stable to temperatures above 700&amp;nbsp;°C (cf. 300–400&amp;nbsp;°C for neodymium magnets). These magnets are found in small motors, headphones, and high-end magnetic [[Pick up (music technology)|pickup]]s for guitars and related musical instruments.&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt; For example, they are used in the motors of a [[solar power|solar-powered]] [[electric aircraft]], the [[Solar Challenger]], and in the [[Vintage Noiseless|Samarium Cobalt Noiseless]] electric guitar and bass pickups.

Another important application of samarium and its compounds is as catalyst and [[chemical reagent]]. Samarium catalysts assist decomposition of plastics, dechlorination of pollutants such as [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs), as well as the dehydration and [[dehydrogenation]] of ethanol.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; [[Lanthanide trifluoromethanesulfonates|Samarium(III) triflate]] (Sm(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, that is Sm(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), is one of the most efficient [[Lewis acid]] catalysts for a halogen-promoted [[Friedel–Crafts reaction]] with alkenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hajra |first1=S.|last2=Maji |first2=B.|last3=Bar |first3=S. |title=Samarium Triflate-Catalyzed Halogen-Promoted Friedel-Crafts Alkylation with Alkenes|date= 2007|journal= [[Org.

In its usual oxidized form, samarium is added to ceramics and glasses where it increases absorption of infrared light. As a (minor) part of [[mischmetal]], samarium is found in "[[flint]]" ignition device of many [[lighter]]s and torches.&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt;&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

[[File:153Sm-lexidronam structure.svg|thumb|Chemical structure of [[Samarium (153Sm) lexidronam|Sm-EDTMP]]]]
Radioactive samarium-153 is a beta emitter with a half-life of 46.3 hours. It is used to kill cancer cells in the treatment of [[lung cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], [[breast cancer]], and [[osteosarcoma]]. For this purpose, samarium-153 is [[Chelation|chelated]] with ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate ([[EDTMP]]) and injected intravenously. The chelation prevents accumulation of radioactive samarium in the body that would result in excessive irradiation and generation of new cancer cells.&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt; The corresponding drug has several names including [[samarium (153Sm) lexidronam|samarium (&lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Sm) lexidronam]]; its [[trade name]] is Quadramet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-06-06|url=http://www.centerwatch.com/patient/drugs/dru267.html |title=Centerwatch About drug Quadramet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pattison |first1=John E. |title=Finger doses received during 153Sm injections |journal=Health physics |volume=77 |issue=5 |pages=530–5 |date=1999 |pmid=10524506 |doi=10.1097/00004032-199911000-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Finlay |first1=I.

Samarium-149 has high cross-section for [[neutron capture]] (41,000&amp;nbsp;[[barn (unit)|barns]]) and is therefore used in the control rods of [[nuclear reactor]]s. Its advantage compared to competing materials, such as boron and cadmium, is stability of absorption – most of the fusion and decay products of samarium-149 are other isotopes of samarium that are also good neutron absorbers. For example, the cross section of samarium-151 is 15,000&amp;nbsp;barns, it is on the order of hundreds of barns for &lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;Sm, &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Sm, and &lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Sm, and is 6,800&amp;nbsp;barns for natural (mixed-isotope) samarium.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=LA2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110706160607/http://www-nds.ipen.br/sgnucdat/b3.pdf Thermal neutron capture cross sections and resonance integrals – Fission product nuclear data]. ipen.br&lt;/ref&gt; Among the decay products in a nuclear reactor, samarium-149 is regarded as the second most important for the reactor design and operation after [[xenon-135]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=DOE Fundamentals Handbook: Nuclear Physics and Reactor Theory |date=January 1993 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Energy]] |url=http://www.hss.energy.gov/nuclearsafety/ns/techstds/standard/hdbk1019/h1019v2.pdf |pages=34, 67 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322040810/http://www.hss.energy.gov/nuclearsafety/ns/techstds/standard/hdbk1019/h1019v2.pdf |archivedate=March 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samarium hexaboride, abbreviated SmB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, has recently been shown to be a [[topological insulator]] with potential applications to [[quantum computing]].&lt;ref name=physorgsamarium&gt;{{cite web|last1=phys.org|title=45-year Physics Mystery Shows a Path to Quantum Transistors|url=http://phys.org/news/2014-12-year-physics-mystery-path-quantum.html|website=phys.org|publisher=phys.org|accessdate=Dec 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-commercial and potential applications===
Samarium-doped [[calcium fluoride]] crystals were used as an active medium in one of the first [[solid-state laser]]s designed and constructed by [[Peter P. Sorokin|Peter Sorokin]] (co-inventor of the [[dye laser]]) and Mirek Stevenson at [[IBM]] research labs in early 1961. This samarium laser emitted pulses of red light at 708.5&amp;nbsp;nm. It had to be cooled by liquid helium and thus did not find practical applications.&lt;ref&gt;Bud, Robert and Gummett, Philip [https://books.google.com/books?id=HMx_6FtHBcUC&amp;pg=PA268 ''Cold War, Hot Science: Applied Research in Britain's Defence Laboratories, 1945–1990''], NMSI Trading Ltd, 2002 {{ISBN|1-900747-47-2}} p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorokin|first1=P.

Another samarium-based laser became the first saturated [[X-ray laser]] operating at wavelengths shorter than 10 nanometers. It provided 50-picosecond pulses at 7.3 and 6.8&amp;nbsp;nm suitable for applications in [[holography]], high-resolution [[microscopy]] of biological specimens, [[deflectometry]], [[interferometry]], and [[radiography]] of dense plasmas related to confinement fusion and [[astrophysics]]. Saturated operation meant that the maximum possible power was extracted from the lasing medium, resulting in the high peak energy of 0.3&amp;nbsp;mJ. The active medium was samarium plasma produced by irradiating samarium-coated glass with a pulsed infrared [[Nd:YAG laser|Nd-glass laser]] (wavelength ~1.05&amp;nbsp;µm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang |first=J. |title=A Saturated X-ray Laser Beam at 7 Nanometers |journal=Science |volume=276 |page=1097 |date=1997 |doi=10.1126/science.276.5315.1097 |issue=5315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, Sm–Nd dating is either insensitive to partitioning of the marker elements during various geological processes, or such partitioning can well be understood and modeled from the [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] of the involved elements.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, Robert and Attendorn, H -G [https://books.google.com/books?id=k90iAnFereYC&amp;pg=PA270 ''Isotopes in the Earth Sciences''], Springer, 1988, {{ISBN|0-412-53710-9}}, pp. 270 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sm{{sup|3+}} ion is a potential [[Activator (phosphor)|activator]] for use in warm-white light emitting diodes.

Samarium salts stimulate metabolism, but it is unclear whether this is the effect of samarium or other lanthanides present with it. The total amount of samarium in adults is about 50&amp;nbsp;[[micrograms|µg]], mostly in liver and kidneys and with about 8&amp;nbsp;µg/L being dissolved in the blood. Samarium is not absorbed by plants to a measurable concentration and therefore is normally not a part of human diet. However, a few plants and vegetables may contain up to 1 part per million of samarium. Insoluble salts of samarium are non-toxic and the soluble ones are only slightly toxic.&lt;ref name=emsley&gt;{{cite book|title= Nature's Building Blocks: An A–Z Guide to the Elements|last= Emsley|first= John|publisher= Oxford University Press|date= 2001|location= Oxford, England, UK|isbn= 0-19-850340-7|chapter= Samarium|pages= 371–374|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&amp;pg=PA371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ingested, only about 0.05% of samarium salts is absorbed into the bloodstream and the remainder is excreted. From the blood, about 45% goes to the liver and 45% is deposited on the surface of the bones where it remains for about 10 years; the balance 10% is excreted.&lt;ref name=LA2&gt;[http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/samarium.pdf Human Health Fact Sheet on Samarium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407032958/http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/samarium.pdf |date=2012-04-07 }}, Los Alamos National Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SiAlON''' [[ceramic]]s are a specialist class of high-temperature refractory materials, with high strength at ambient and high temperatures, good thermal shock resistance and exceptional resistance to wetting or corrosion by molten non-ferrous metals, compared to other refractory materials such as, for example, alumina. A typical use is with handling of molten aluminium. They also are exceptionally corrosion resistant and hence are also used in the chemical industry. SiAlONs also have high wear resistance, low thermal expansion and good oxidation resistance up to above ~1000&amp;nbsp;°C. They were first reported around 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF00553123|title=Sialons and related nitrogen ceramics|journal=Journal of Materials Science|volume=11|issue=6|pages=1135|year=1976|last1=Jack|first1=K.

*m and n are the numbers of Al–N and Al–O bonds substituting for Si–N bonds
SiAlONs are ceramics based on the elements [[silicon]] (Si), [[aluminium]] (Al), [[oxygen]] (O) and [[nitrogen]] (N). They are solid solutions of [[silicon nitride]] (Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), where Si–N bonds are partly replaced with Al–N and Al–O bonds. The substitution degrees can be estimated from the lattice parameters.&lt;ref name=Riedel/&gt; The charge discrepancy caused by the substitution can be compensated by adding metal [[cation]]s such as Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, where Ln stands for [[lanthanide]]. SiAlONs exist in three basic forms, which are iso-structural with one of the two common forms of silicon nitride, alpha and beta, and with orthorhombic [[silicon oxynitride]]; they are hence named as α, β and O'-SiAlONs.&lt;ref name=review1/&gt;

==Production==

SiAlONs are produced by first combining a mixture of raw materials including [[silicon nitride]], alumina, [[aluminium nitride]], [[silica]] and the [[oxide]] of a [[rare-earth element]] such as [[yttrium]]. The powder mix is fabricated into a "green" compact by [[isostatic powder compaction]] or [[slipcasting]], for example. Then the shaped form is densified, typically by [[pressureless sintering]] or [[hot isostatic pressing]]. The sintered part may then need to be machined by diamond [[grinding (abrasive cutting)]].&lt;ref name=Riedel/&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:SiAlONphosphors.jpg|thumb|A variety of SiAlON phosphor powders under UV light]]
SiAlON ceramics have found extensive use in non-ferrous molten metal handling, particularly aluminium and its alloys, including metal feed tubes for aluminum die casting, burner and immersion heater tubes, injector and degassing for nonferrous metals, thermocouple protection tubes, crucibles and ladles.

In metal forming, SiAlON is used as a [[cutting tool]] for machining chill cast iron and as brazing and welding fixtures and pins, particularly for [[resistance welding]].

Other applications include in the chemical and process industries and the [[Petroleum Industry|oil and gas]] industries, due to sialons excellent chemical stability and [[corrosion resistance]] and [[wear resistance]] properties.

Some [[rare-earth]] [[activator (phosphor)|activated]] SiAlONs are [[photoluminescent]] and can serve as [[phosphor]]s. [[Europium]](II)-[[doped]] β-SiAlON absorbs in [[ultraviolet]] and [[visible light]] spectrum and emits intense broadband visible emission. Its luminance and color does not change significantly with temperature, due to the temperature-stable crystal structure. It has a great potential as a green down-conversion phosphor for white [[LED]]s; a yellow variant also exists. For white LEDs, a blue LED is used with a yellow phosphor, or with a green and yellow SiAlON phosphor and a red CaAlSiN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based (CASN) phosphor.&lt;ref name=review1&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.stam.2007.08.005|title=Silicon-based oxynitride and nitride phosphors for white LEDs—A review|journal=Science and Technology of Advanced Materials|volume=8|issue=7–8|pages=588|year=2016|last1=Xie|first1=Rong-Jun|last2=Hirosaki|first2=Naoto|bibcode=2007STAdM...8..588X}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''South Texas Oilfield Expo''' is an oil and gas industry trade show held annually at the [[Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center]] in [[San Antonio]]. Produced by trade show production company '''Event Equity Partners LLC''', the expo was previously held at the [[American Bank Center]] in [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]]. The 2012 event featured 2000 exhibitors in over 600 booths, and was the largest event held at the American Bank Center since [[SMG (property management)|SMG]] took over the venue in 2004, according to facility administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Mike|title=South Texas Oilfield Expo draws thousands of oil and gas insiders to Corpus Christi|url=http://www.caller.com/news/2012/sep/20/south-texas-oilfield-expo-draws-thousands-of-oil/|accessdate=December 4, 2013|newspaper=Corpus Christi Caller-Times|date=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 event, which took place July 9–10, 2014, was recognized by Trade Show Executive's annual "Fastest 50 Awards &amp; Summit" as the fifth fastest-growing trade show in North America when measured by net square footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tradeshowexecutive.com/events/fastest50/about.htm |title=Trade Show Executive's Fastest 50 Awards &amp; Summit |access-date=July 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 event is scheduled for July 27 and 28, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://southtexasoilfieldexpo.com/ |title=South Texas Oilfield Expo |website=South Texas Oilfield Expo |publisher=Event Equity Partners LLC |access-date=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; carbon allotropes belong to the second group - they are hypothetically quasi-stable at the high pressure. BC-8 carbon is not only a superdense allotrope but also one of the oldest hypothetical carbon structure - initially it was proposed in 1984 in the work R. Biswas et al.&lt;ref name=PhyRevB_1984/&gt; The MP8 structure proposed in the work J. Sun et al.,&lt;ref name=JChemPhys_2009/&gt; is almost two times denser than diamond - its density is as high as 7.06 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and it is the highest value reported so far.

==Band gaps==
All hypothetical superdense carbon allotropes have dissimilar [[band gap]]s compared to the others. For example, SC4&lt;ref name="PhyRevB_1996"/&gt; is supposed to be a metallic allotrope while st12, m32, m32*, t32, t32* have band gaps larger that 5.0 eV.&lt;ref name="PhyRevB_2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PhyRevB_1987"/&gt;

==Carbon tetrahedra==
These new materials would have structures based on carbon tetrahedra, and represent the densest of such structures. On the opposite end of the density spectrum is a recently theorized tetrahedral structure called [[T-carbon]]. This is obtained by replacing carbon atoms in diamond with carbon tetrahedra. In contrast to superdense allotropes, T-carbon would have very low density and hardness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.155703|title= T-Carbon: A Novel Carbon Allotrope|year= 2011|last1= Sheng|first1= Xian-Lei|last2= Yan|first2= Qing-Bo|last3= Ye|first3= Fei|last4= Zheng|first4= Qing-Rong|last5= Su|first5= Gang|journal= Physical Review Letters|volume= 106|issue= 15|bibcode = 2011PhRvL.106o5703S |arxiv = 1105.0977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7054">A '''suspension keel''' is an extension pylon to the bodywork of single-seat, [[open wheel]] [[racing cars]] designed with a raised [[nose cone]], to allow the lower [[double wishbone suspension|suspension arms]] to be attached to the car approximately parallel to the road surface. In recent years the placing and design of a suspension keel, or the lack of such, has been one of the few distinct variables in [[Formula One]] chassis design.&lt;ref name="scarbs"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scarbsf1.com/keels/formula_1_keels.htm |title= Formula 1 Keels: From no keel to single keel, twin and V keels and finally back to no Keels |accessdate= 2007-02-16 |last= Scarborough |first= C. |authorlink= Craig Scarborough |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional low nose cone designs (e.g. the [[McLaren MP4/4]]) allow the lower suspension arms to be directly attached to the main structural members of the car. However, since the move to high nose cone designs - which allow better use of [[Diffuser (automotive)|airflow underneath]] the car,&lt;ref name="F2007"&gt;{{cite web | last= Formula1.com | url= http://www.formula1.com/news/technical/2007/0/373.html |title= Ferrari F2007 - zero keel concept |accessdate= 2007-02-16 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to a lesser extent the [[downforce|front wing]] - location of these lower arms has proven problematic. For ideal suspension geometry, and hence maximum [[Car handling|mechanical grip]], the lower arms should be long and near parallel with the road. As there is no longer any structural bodywork in these low positions, extensions were developed to allow the suspension to be mounted with correct geometry. Since the advent of high nose designs in the early 1990s, pioneered on the [[Tyrrell 019]] Formula One car, three major keel designs have emerged to solve this problem:

{{-}}
[[File:Ferrari F2005 front suspension.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Ferrari F2005]] has a conventional single keel design in the 2000s]]
:'''Single-keel:''' Perhaps the simplest response, utilising a single, planar extension to the [[ventral]] surface of the car's nose cone, providing a plate onto which the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] ends of the suspension arms can be mounted. Benefits include a simple construction design, and the flexibility of having a large surface, thus allowing the suspension geometry to be altered for fine tuning. A serious hindrance in the single-keel design is that the keel itself protrudes into the underbody airflow, thus reducing the benefits of the raised nose design. As a consequence of this the single keel design fell out of favour in the late 2000s. However, for the [[2010 Formula One season]] both the [[Mercedes MGP W01]] and [[Virgin VR-01]] feature single keel front suspension.

{{-}}
[[File:Sauber petronas c22.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Short twin keels in use on the [[Sauber C22]].]]
:'''Twin-keel:''' As the name suggests, rather than one single keel, two shorter keel stubs are used. Each protrudes from the underside or lower corners of the nose cone, and the left and right suspension arms are mounted to the appropriate keel. This design reduces the disturbance to the airflow, but compromises the suspension set up and configuration flexibility,&lt;ref name="twin-keel"&gt;{{cite web | last= F1Technical.net | url= http://www.f1technical.net/glossary/T |title= F1 Technical Dictionary - T |accessdate= 2007-02-16 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduces significant structural complexity and weight. The twin-keel concept was conceived by [[Harvey Postlethwaite]] during his time at [[Honda Racing F1|Honda Racing Developments]], before being introduced by [[Sauber]] during the [[2000 Formula One season]] and swiftly copied by many other teams. In {{F1|2007}}, only [[Red Bull Racing]] used a twin-keel chassis.&lt;ref name="autosport"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Scarborough | first = C. | authorlink = Craig Scarborough | date = 28 January 2007 | title = Analysis: Newey surprises with twin keel | journal = [[Autosport]] | volume = | issue = | pages = | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/56506 | accessdate = 2007-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{-}}
[[File:Red Bull Racing F1 2006 EMS.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A V-keel in use on the 2006 [[Red Bull RB2]].]]
:'''V-keel:''' Used principally by the [[Renault F1]] team, who introduced the design in {{F1|2005}},&lt;ref name="R25"&gt;{{cite web | last= F1Technical.net | url= http://www.f1technical.net/f1db/cars/887 |title= Renault R25 |accessdate= 2007-02-16 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; this variant uses two keel elements protruding downward in a V shape. The tips of the elements are fused, and at this point the suspension arms are mounted.&lt;ref name="v-keel"&gt;{{cite web | last= F1Technical.net | url= http://www.f1technical.net/glossary/V |title= F1 Technical Dictionary - V |accessdate= 2007-02-16 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Something of a compromise position, benefits include a reduction in disturbance to the underbody airflow in comparison to a single-keel design, with fewer geometry restrictions than with twin-keels.

{{-}}
[[File:Sauber F1.07 vr TCE.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Zero keel design as employed on the [[BMW Sauber F1.07]]. Note the lower suspension arms mounted directly onto the lower edge of the nosecone, and the angle between the arms and road surface necessary for this arrangement.]]
One limitation of any keel design is that, while the keel influence may vary, the suspension linkages themselves still disrupt the underbody airflow. This problem was exacerbated when the [[FIA]] introduced rule changes in {{F1|2005}} that forced teams to mount their front wing in a more elevated position. In response to this, many F1 teams have developed '''zero-keel''' chassis designs. Here the keel is removed entirely, and the suspension is mounted directly to the chassis.&lt;ref name="105B"&gt;{{cite web | last= F1Technical.net | url= http://www.f1technical.net/features/1247 |title= Toyota development in 2005 |accessdate= 2007-02-16 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the nose cone is in a raised position, this entails that the suspension arms take a distinctly inclined angle with respect to the road surface, reducing suspension efficiency. However, with continued restrictions to aerodynamic [[downforce]] through the use of [[airfoil|aerofoil]] wings, and the lighter [[V8 engine|V8]] engines specified from 2006 onwards causing weight distribution to shift forward, many designers apparently consider this drawback to be less significant than the concomitant increase in [[Venturi effect|venturi]] downforce generated underneath the car; except for Renault and Red Bull, all of the teams in the 2007 Formula One World Championship used a zero-keel design.&lt;ref name="scarbs" /&gt;

{{Infobox technetium}}
'''Technetium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Tc''' and [[atomic number]] 43. It is the lightest element whose isotopes are all [[radioactive]]; none are [[stable nuclide|stable]], excluding the fully ionized state of &lt;sup&gt;97&lt;/sup&gt;Tc.&lt;ref name="Takahashi et al"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bound-state beta decay of highly ionized atoms|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13335547|last1=Takahashi|first1=K|last2=Boyd|first2=R. N.|last3=Mathews|first3=G. J.|last4=Yokoi|first4=K.|date=October 1987|accessdate=2016-11-20|issn=0556-2813|oclc=1639677|volume=36|issue=4|pages=1522–1528|journal=Physical Review C|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.36.1522|pmid=9954244|bibcode=1987PhRvC..36.1522T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all technetium is produced synthetically, and only about 18000 tons can be found at any given time in the Earth's crust. Naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous [[fission product]] in [[uranium ore]] and [[thorium]] ore, the most common source, or the product of [[neutron capture]] in [[molybdenum]] ores. This silvery gray, crystalline [[transition metal]] lies between [[rhenium]] and [[manganese]] in [[group 7 element|group 7]] of the [[periodic table]], and its chemical properties are intermediate between those of these two adjacent elements. The most common naturally occurring isotope is &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc.

Many of technetium's properties were predicted by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] before the element was discovered. Mendeleev noted a gap in his periodic table and gave the undiscovered element the provisional name ''[[Mendeleev's predicted elements|ekamanganese]]'' (''Em''). In 1937, technetium (specifically the [[technetium-97]] isotope) became the first predominantly artificial element to be produced, hence its name (from the Greek {{lang|el|τεχνητός}}, meaning "synthetic or artificial", + {{nowrap|''[[wikt:-ium#Suffix|-ium]]'').}}

One short-lived [[gamma ray]]-emitting [[nuclear isomer]] of technetium—[[technetium-99m]]—is used in [[nuclear medicine]] for a wide variety of diagnostic tests, such as bone cancer diagnoses. The ground state of this [[nuclide]], technetium-99, is used as a gamma-ray-free source of [[beta particle]]s. Long-lived [[isotopes of technetium|technetium isotopes]] produced commercially are by-products of the [[nuclear fission|fission]] of [[uranium-235]] in [[nuclear reactor]]s and are extracted from [[nuclear fuel cycle|nuclear fuel rods]]. Because no isotope of technetium has a [[half-life]] longer than 4.2&amp;nbsp;million years ([[technetium-98]]), the 1952 detection of technetium in [[red giant]]s, helped to prove that stars can produce heavier elements.

==History==

===Search for element 43===
From the 1860s through 1871, early forms of the periodic table proposed by Dmitri Mendeleev contained a gap between [[molybdenum]] (element&amp;nbsp;42) and [[ruthenium]] (element&amp;nbsp;44). In 1871, Mendeleev predicted this missing element would occupy the empty place below [[manganese]] and have similar chemical properties. Mendeleev gave it the provisional name ''ekamanganese'' (from ''eka''-, the [[Sanskrit]] word for ''one)'' because the predicted element was one place down from the known element manganese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF00837634|title = Technetium, the missing element|date = 1996|last = Jonge|journal = European Journal of Nuclear Medicine|volume = 23|pages = 336–44|pmid = 8599967|last2 = Pauwels|first2 = E. K.|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early misidentifications===
Many early researchers, both before and after the periodic table was published, were eager to be the first to discover and name the missing element. Its location in the table suggested that it should be easier to find than other undiscovered elements.

German chemists [[Walter Noddack]], [[Otto Berg (scientist)|Otto Berg]], and [[Ida Tacke]] reported the discovery of element&amp;nbsp;75 and element&amp;nbsp;43 in 1925, and named element&amp;nbsp;43 ''[[masurium]]'' (after [[Masuria]] in eastern [[Prussia]], now in [[Poland]], the region where Walter Noddack's family originated).&lt;ref name="multidict"/&gt; The group bombarded [[Ferrocolumbite|columbite]] with a beam of [[electron]]s and deduced element&amp;nbsp;43 was present by examining [[X-ray]] diffraction [[spectrogram]]s.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p423"&gt;{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=423}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wavelength]] of the X-rays produced is related to the atomic number by a formula derived by [[Henry Moseley]] in 1913.

The first results were surprisingly close to their published spectrum! Over the next couple of years, we refined our reconstruction of their analytical methods and performed more sophisticated simulations. The agreement between simulated and reported spectra improved further. Our calculation of the amount of element&amp;nbsp;43 required to produce their spectrum is quite similar to the direct measurements of natural technetium abundance in uranium ore published in 1999 by Dave Curtis and colleagues at Los Alamos.

===Official discovery and later history===
The [[Discovery of the chemical elements|discovery]] of element&amp;nbsp;43 was finally confirmed in a 1937 experiment at the [[University of Palermo]] in Sicily by [[Carlo Perrier]] and [[Emilio Segrè]].&lt;ref name="Heiserman1992p164"&gt;{{harvnb| Heiserman|1992|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1936, Segrè visited the United States, first [[Columbia University]] in New York and then the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] in California. He persuaded [[cyclotron]] inventor [[Ernest Lawrence]] to let him take back some discarded cyclotron parts that had become [[radioactive]]. Lawrence mailed him a [[molybdenum]] foil that had been part of the deflector in the cyclotron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Emilio |last=Segrè |date=1993 |title=A Mind Always in Motion: The Autobiography of Emilio Segrè |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=978-0520076273 |pages=115–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Segrè enlisted his colleague Perrier to attempt to prove, through comparative chemistry, that the molybdenum activity was indeed from an element with the atomic number 43. In 1937 they succeeded in isolating the [[isotope]]s [[technetium-95]]m and [[technetium-97]].&lt;ref name=segre/&gt;&lt;ref name=blocks&gt;{{cite book| title = Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|last = Emsley |first=J. |location = New York| publisher = Oxford University Press| date = 2001| isbn = 978-0-19-850340-8| pages = 422–425|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yhi5X7OwuGkC&amp;pg=PA423}}&lt;/ref&gt; University of Palermo officials wanted them to name their discovery "''panormium''", after the [[Latin]] name for [[Palermo]], ''Panormus''.

Merrill]] in California detected the [[Emission spectrum|spectral signature]] of technetium (specifically [[wavelength]]s of 403.1&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]], 423.8&amp;nbsp;nm, 426.2&amp;nbsp;nm, and 429.7&amp;nbsp;nm) in light from [[Stellar classification#Class S|S-type]] [[red giant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merrill |first=P. W.|journal=Science|volume=115|pages=479–89 [484]|date=1952|title=Technetium in the stars|doi=10.1126/science.115.2992.479|pmid=17792758|issue=2992|bibcode = 1952Sci...115..479. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stars were near the end of their lives, yet were rich in this short-lived element, indicating that it was being produced in the stars by [[nuclear reaction]]s. This evidence bolstered the hypothesis that heavier elements are the product of [[nucleosynthesis]] in stars.&lt;ref name=blocks/&gt; More recently, such observations provided evidence that elements are formed by [[neutron capture]] in the [[s-process]].&lt;ref name=s8&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that discovery, there have been many searches in terrestrial materials for natural sources of technetium. In 1962, technetium-99 was isolated and identified in [[uraninite|pitchblende]] from the [[Belgian Congo]] in extremely small quantities (about 0.2&amp;nbsp;ng/kg);&lt;ref name=s8/&gt; there it originates as a [[spontaneous fission]] product of [[uranium-238]]. The [[Oklo]] [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] contains evidence that significant amounts of technetium-99 were produced and have since decayed into [[ruthenium-99]].&lt;ref name=s8/&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
Technetium is a silvery-gray radioactive [[metal]] with an appearance similar to [[platinum]], commonly obtained as a gray powder.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;  The [[crystal structure]] of the pure metal is [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] [[close-packed]]. Atomic technetium has characteristic [[Emission spectrum|emission lines]] at these [[wavelength]]s of light: 363.3&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]], 403.1&amp;nbsp;nm, 426.2&amp;nbsp;nm, 429.7&amp;nbsp;nm, and 485.3&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The CRC Handbook| publisher =CRC press|chapter = Line Spectra of the Elements| date = 2004–2005|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=q2qJId5TKOkC&amp;pg=PT1672|pages=10–70 (1672) | first=David R. | last=Lide | isbn=978-0-8493-0595-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metal form is slightly [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]], meaning its [[dipole|magnetic dipoles]] align with external [[magnetic field]]s, but will assume random orientations once the field is removed.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{cite book| title = The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements| editor = Hampel, C. A.| last = Rimshaw |first=S. J.| location = New York| publisher = Reinhold Book Corporation| date = 1968| pages = 689–693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure, metallic, single-crystal technetium becomes a [[type-II superconductor]] at temperatures below 7.46&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Irregular crystals and trace impurities raise this transition temperature to 11.2&amp;nbsp;K for 99.9% pure technetium powder.{{harv|Schwochau|2000|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Schwochau, K. ''Technetium: Chemistry and Radiopharmaceutical Applications''; Wiley-VCH:Weinheim, Germany, 2000.

&lt;/ref&gt; Below this temperature, technetium has a very high [[London penetration depth|magnetic penetration depth]], greater than any other element except [[niobium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Technetium as a Material for AC Superconductivity Applications| last = Autler |first=S.

===Chemical properties===
Technetium is located in the [[Group 7 element|seventh group]] of the periodic table, between [[rhenium]] and [[manganese]]. As predicted by the [[History of the periodic table|periodic law]], its chemical properties are between those two elements. Of the two, technetium more closely resembles rhenium, particularly in its chemical inertness and tendency to form [[covalent bond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=1044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike manganese, technetium does not readily form [[cation]]s ([[ion]]s with a net positive charge). Technetium exhibits nine [[oxidation state]]s from −1 to +7, with +4, +5, and +7 being the most common.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; Technetium dissolves in [[aqua regia]], [[nitric acid]], and concentrated [[sulfuric acid]], but it is not soluble in [[hydrochloric acid]] of any concentration.&lt;ref name= CRC/&gt;

Metallic technetium slowly [[tarnish]]es in moist air&lt;ref name="LANL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Technetium|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/43.shtml|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|date=2003-12-15|work=Periodic Table of the Elements|last=Husted|first=R.|accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in powder form, burns in [[oxygen]].

Technetium can catalyse the destruction of [[hydrazine]] by [[nitric acid]], and this property is due to its multiplicity of valencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0022-5088(84)90023-7 | title=The technetium-catalysed oxidation of hydrazine by nitric acid | journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals | date=1984 | volume=97 | pages=191–203 | first=John | last=Garraway}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a problem in the separation of plutonium from uranium in [[Nuclear reprocessing|nuclear fuel processing]], where hydrazine is used as a protective reductant to keep plutonium in the trivalent rather than the more stable tetravalent state. The problem was exacerbated by the mutually-enhanced solvent extraction of technetium and zirconium at the previous stage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0022-5088(85)90379-0 | title=Coextraction of pertechnetate and zirconium by tri-n-butyl phosphate | journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals | date=1985 | volume=106 | issue=1 | pages=183–192 | first=J. | last=Garraway}}&lt;/ref&gt; and required a process modification.

==Compounds==
===Pertechnetate and derivatives===
[[File:Pertechnetate1.svg|thumb|left|200 px|Pertechnetate is one of the most available forms of technetium.  It is structurally related to [[permanganate]].]]
The most prevalent form of technetium that is easily accessible is sodium pertechnetate, Na[TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;].  The majority of this material is produced by radioactive decay from [&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|pp=127–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nuclmed/&gt;
:[&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;  →   [&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  γ
[[Pertechnetate]] (tetroxidotechnetate) {{chem|TcO|4|-}} behaves analogously to perchlorate, both of which are [[tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]]. Unlike [[permanganate]] ({{chem|MnO|4|-}}), it is only a weak oxidizing agent.

Related to pertechnetate is [[Technetium(VII) oxide|heptoxide]].  This pale-yellow, volatile solid is produced by oxidation of Tc metal and related precursors:
:4 Tc + 7 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Tc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
It is a very rare example of a molecular metal oxide, other examples being [[OsO4|OsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[RuO4|RuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]].  It adopts a [[Centrosymmetry|centrosymmetric]] structure with two types of Tc−O bonds with 167 and 184&amp;nbsp;pm bond lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Krebs|first = B.|title = Technetium(VII)-oxid: Ein Übergangsmetalloxid mit Molekülstruktur im festen Zustand (Technetium(VII) Oxide, a Transition Metal Oxide with a Molecular Structure in the Solid State)|journal = Angewandte Chemie|date = 1969|volume = 81|pages = 328–329|doi = 10.1002/ange.19690810905|issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technetium heptoxide hydrolyzes to [[pertechnetate]] and [[pertechnetic acid]], depending on the pH:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Herrell|first1 = A. Y.|last2 = Busey|first2 = R. H.|last3 = Gayer|first3 = K. H.|title = Technetium(VII) Oxide, in Inorganic Syntheses| date = 1977|volume = XVII| pages = 155–158|isbn= 978-0-07-044327-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Tc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; →  2 TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:Tc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →  2 HTcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

HTcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is a strong acid. In concentrated [[sulfuric acid]], [TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; converts to the octahedral form TcO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the conjugate base of the hypothetical tri[[aquo complex]] [TcO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|display-authors=7|author=Poineau F|author2=Weck PF|author3=German K|author4=Maruk A|author5=Kirakosyan G|author6= Lukens W|author7=Rego DB|author8=Sattelberger AP|author9=Czerwinski KR|title= Speciation of heptavalent technetium in sulfuric acid: structural and spectroscopic studies|journal= Dalton Transactions|date= 2010|volume= 39 |issue=37|pages=8616–8619|doi=10.1039/C0DT00695E |url=http://radchem.nevada.edu/docs/pub/tc%20in%20h2so4%20%28dalton%29%202010-08-23.pdf|pmid=20730190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other chalcogenide derivatives===
Technetium forms a dioxide,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[metal dichalcogenide|disulfide]], di[[selenide]], and di[[telluride (chemistry)|telluride]].  An ill-defined Tc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; forms upon treating [[pertechnate]] with hydrogen sulfide. It thermally decomposes into disulfide and elemental sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|pp=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly the dioxide can be produced by reduction of the Tc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;.

Unlike the case for rhenium, a trioxide has not been isolated for technetium. However, TcO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has been identified in the gas phase using [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1524/ract.1993.60.23.121|title=High-Temperature Oxide and Hydroxide Vapor Species of Technetium|journal=Radiochimica Acta|volume=60|issue=2–3|year=1993|last1=Gibson|first1=John K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple hydride and halide complexes===
Technetium forms the simple complex {{chem|TcH|9|2-}}.  The potassium salt is [[isostructural]] with [[Potassium nonahydridorhenate|{{chem|ReH|9|2-}}]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following binary (containing only two elements) technetium halides are known: [[TcF6|TcF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], TcF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, [[TcCl4|TcCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], TcBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, TcBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, α-TcCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, β-TcCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, TcI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, α-TcCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and β-TcCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The [[oxidation state]]s range from Tc(VI) to Tc(II). Technetium halides exhibit different structure types, such as molecular octahedral complexes, extended chains, layered sheets, and metal clusters arranged in a three-dimensional network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3100&amp;context=thesesdissertations|title=Binary Technetium Halides|last=Johnstone|first=E.

TcCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is obtained by chlorination of Tc metal or Tc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; Upon heating, TcCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; gives the corresponding Tc(III) and Tc(II) chlorides.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;
:TcCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → α-TcCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 1/2 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:TcCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → β-TcCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1/2 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
[[File:Zirconium-tetrachloride-3D-balls-A.png|thumb|180 px|left|TcCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; forms chain-like structures, similar to the behavior of several other metal tetrachlorides.]]
The structure of TcCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is composed of infinite zigzag chains of edge-sharing TcCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra.  It is isomorphous to transition metal tetrachlorides of [[zirconium]], [[hafnium]], and [[platinum]].&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;

Two polymorphs of technetium trichloride exist, α- and β-TcCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The α polymorph is also denoted as Tc&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;. It adopts a confacial [[Octahedral molecular geometry#Bioctahedral molecular geometry|bioctahedral structure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja105730e|pmid=20977207|title=Synthesis and Structure of Technetium Trichloride|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=132|issue=45|pages=15864–5|year=2010|last1=Poineau|first1=Frederic|last2=Johnstone|first2=Erik V.|last3=Weck|first3=Philippe F.|last4=Kim|first4=Eunja|last5=Forster|first5=Paul M.|last6=Scott|first6=Brian L.|last7=Sattelberger|first7=Alfred P.|last8=Czerwinski|first8=Kenneth R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is prepared by treating the chloro-acetate Tc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with HCl. Like [[Trirhenium nonachloride|Re&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]], the structure of the α-polymorph consists of triangles with short M-M distances. β-TcCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; features octahedral Tc centers, which are organized in pairs, as seen also for [[molybdenum trichloride]]. TcBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; does not adopt the structure of either trichloride phase.  Instead it has the structure of [[molybdenum tribromide]], consisting of chains of confacial octahedra with alternating short and long Tc—Tc contacts.  TcI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has the same structure as the high temperature phase of [[titanium(III) iodide|TiI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], featuring chains of confacial octahedra with equal Tc—Tc contacts.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;

Several anionic technetium halides are known.  The binary tetrahalides can be converted to the hexahalides [TcX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; (X = F, Cl, Br, I), which adopt [[octahedral molecular geometry]].&lt;ref name=s8/&gt;  More reduced halides form anionic clusters with Tc–Tc bonds.  The situation is similar for the related elements of Mo, W, Re.  These clusters have the nuclearity Tc&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Tc&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, Tc&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, and Tc&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;. The more stable Tc&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and Tc&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; clusters have prism shapes where vertical pairs of Tc atoms are connected by triple bonds and the planar atoms by single bonds. Every technetium atom makes six bonds, and the remaining valence electrons can be saturated by one axial and two [[bridging ligand]] halogen atoms such as [[chlorine]] or [[bromine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = K.

===Coordination and organometallic complexes===
[[File:Tc CNCH2CMe2(OMe) 6Cation.png|thumb|right|[[Technetium (99mTc) sestamibi]]is ("Cardiolite") widely used for imaging of the heart.]]

{{main|Isotopes of technetium}}
Technetium, with [[atomic number]] (denoted ''Z'') 43, is the lowest-numbered element in the periodic table of which all isotopes are [[radioactive]]. The second-lightest exclusively radioactive element, [[promethium]], has an atomic number of 61.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; [[Atomic nucleus|Atomic nuclei]] with an odd number of [[proton]]s are less stable than those with even numbers, even when the total number of [[nucleon]]s (protons + [[neutron]]s) is even,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8HSGFThnbvkC&amp;pg=PA547|page=547|title=Principles of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis: with a new preface|author=Clayton, D.

Technetium-99 (&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc) is a major product of the fission of uranium-235 (&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U), making it the most common and most readily available isotope of technetium.

==Occurrence and production==
Technetium occurs naturally in the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] in minute concentrations of about 0.003 parts per trillion. This totals about 18000 tonnes at any given time, assuming the mass of the Earth's crust is &lt;span style="display:none;"&gt;6000000000000000000000&lt;/span&gt;6×10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; kilograms. Technetium is so rare because technetium-98's [[half-life]] is only 4.2&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;years. More than a thousand of such periods have passed since the formation of the [[Earth]], so the probability for the survival of even one atom of [[primordial nuclide|primordial]] technetium is effectively zero. However, small amounts exist as spontaneous [[fission product]]s in [[uranium ore]]s. A kilogram of uranium contains an estimated 1&amp;nbsp;nanogram (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;g) of technetium.&lt;ref name=blocks/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ac961159q|title = Analysis of Naturally Produced Technetium and Plutonium in Geologic Materials|date = 1997|last1 = Dixon|first1 = P.|journal = Analytical Chemistry|volume = 69|pages = 1692–9|last2 = Curtis|first2 = David B.|last3 = Musgrave|first3 = John|last4 = Roensch|first4 = Fred|last5 = Roach|first5 = Jeff|last6 = Rokop|first6 = Don|issue = 9|pmid = 21639292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1016/S0016-7037(98)00282-8|title =Nature's uncommon elements: plutonium and technetium|first4 =Jan|last4 =Cramer|first3 =Paul|last3 =Dixon|first2 =June|date=1999|last2 =Fabryka-Martin|last1=Curtis|first1=D.|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume =63|pages =275|bibcode=1999GeCoA..63..275C|issue =2|url =https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc704244/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[red giant]] stars with the spectral types S-, M-, and N contain a spectral absorption line indicating the presence of technetium.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book| first=C.

Technetium-99 is produced by the [[nuclear fission]] of both uranium-235 and plutonium-239. It is therefore present in [[radioactive waste]] and in the [[nuclear fallout]] of [[nuclear weapon|fission bomb]] explosions. Its decay, measured in [[becquerel]]s per amount of spent fuel, is the dominant contributor to nuclear waste radioactivity after about 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years after the creation of the nuclear waste.&lt;ref name="yoshihara"/&gt; From 1945 to 1994, an estimated 160&amp;nbsp;T[[Becquerel|Bq]] (about 250&amp;nbsp;kg) of technetium-99 was released into the environment during atmospheric [[nuclear test]]s.&lt;ref name="yoshihara"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QLHr-UYWoo8C&amp;pg=PA69|page=69|title=Technetium in the environment|last1=Desmet |first1=G. |last2=Myttenaere |first2=C.|publisher=Springer|date=1986|isbn=978-0-85334-421-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of technetium-99 from nuclear reactors released into the environment up to 1986 is on the order of 1000&amp;nbsp;TBq (about 1600&amp;nbsp;kg), primarily by [[nuclear fuel reprocessing]]; most of this was discharged into the sea. Reprocessing methods have reduced emissions since then, but as of 2005 the primary release of technetium-99 into the environment is by the [[Sellafield]] plant, which released an estimated 550&amp;nbsp;TBq (about 900&amp;nbsp;kg) from 1995–1999 into the [[Irish Sea]].&lt;ref name=leon&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.radiochem.org/paper/JN63/jn6326.pdf|journal=Journal of Nuclear and Radiochemical Sciences|volume=6|issue=3|pages=253–259|date=2005|title=99Tc in the Environment: Sources, Distribution and Methods|last=Garcia-Leon |first=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000 onwards the amount has been limited by regulation to 90&amp;nbsp;TBq (about 140&amp;nbsp;kg) per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Technetium-99 Behaviour in the Terrestrial Environment&amp;nbsp;— Field Observations and Radiotracer Experiments|first = K.|last = Tagami|journal=Journal of Nuclear and Radiochemical Sciences|volume = 4|pages= A1–A8|date = 2003|doi=10.14494/jnrs2000.4.a1|url= https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnrs2000/4/1/4_1_A1/_pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Discharge of technetium into the sea resulted in contamination of some seafood with minuscule quantities of this element.

===Fission product for commercial use===
The [[Metastability|metastable]] isotope technetium-99m is continuously produced as a [[fission product]] from the fission of uranium or [[plutonium]] in [[nuclear reactor]]s:

Because used fuel is allowed to stand for several years before reprocessing, all molybdenum-99 and technetium-99m is decayed by the time that the fission products are separated from the major [[actinide]]s in conventional [[nuclear reprocessing]]. The liquid left after plutonium–uranium extraction ([[PUREX]]) contains a high concentration of technetium as {{chem|TcO|4|-}} but almost all of this is technetium-99, not technetium-99m.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost two-thirds of the world's supply comes from two reactors; the [[National Research Universal Reactor]] at [[Chalk River Laboratories]]  in Ontario, Canada, and the [[Petten nuclear reactor|High Flux Reactor]] at [[Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group]] in Petten, Netherlands.

The two new Canadian [[Multipurpose Applied Physics Lattice Experiment]] reactors planned and built to produce 200% of the demand of technetium-99m relieved all other producers from building their own reactors. With the cancellation of the already tested reactors in 2008, the future supply of technetium-99m became problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = Gregory S. | last2 = Maddahi | first2 = Jamshid | title = The technetium shortage | journal = [[Journal of Nuclear Cardiology]] | volume = 17 | pages = 993–8 | date = 2010 | doi = 10.1007/s12350-010-9281-8 | issue = 6 | pmid=20717761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waste disposal===
The long half-life of technetium-99 and its potential to form [[anionic]] species creates a major concern for long-term [[High-level radioactive waste management|disposal of radioactive waste]]. Many of the processes designed to remove fission products in reprocessing plants aim at [[cationic]] species such as [[caesium]] (e.g., [[caesium-137]]) and [[strontium]] (e.g., [[strontium-90]]). Hence the pertechnetate escapes through those processes. Current disposal options favor [[geological repository|burial]] in continental, geologically stable rock. The primary danger with such practice is the likelihood that the waste will contact water, which could leach radioactive contamination into the environment. The anionic pertechnetate and [[iodide]] tend not to adsorb into the surfaces of minerals, and are likely to be washed away. By comparison [[plutonium]], [[uranium]], and [[caesium]]  tend to bind to soil particles. Technetium could be immobilized by some environments, such as microbial activity in lake bottom sediments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = German | first1 = Konstantin E. | last2 = Firsova | first2 = E.

An alternative disposal method, [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]], has been demonstrated at [[CERN]] for technetium-99. In this process, the technetium (technetium-99 as a metal target) is bombarded with [[neutron]]s to form the short-lived technetium-100 (half-life = 16&amp;nbsp;seconds) which decays by beta decay to [[ruthenium]]-100. If recovery of usable ruthenium is a goal, an extremely pure technetium target is needed; if small traces of the [[minor actinide]]s such as [[americium]] and [[curium]] are present in the target, they are likely to undergo fission and form more [[fission product]]s which increase the radioactivity of the irradiated target. The formation of ruthenium-106 (half-life 374&amp;nbsp;days) from the 'fresh fission' is likely to increase the activity of the final ruthenium metal, which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the ruthenium can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000XT88.txt|title=Alternative disposal concepts for high-level and transuranic radioactive waste disposal|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|date=1979|author=Altomare, P|last2=Bernardi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual separation of technetium-99 from spent nuclear fuel is a long process. During [[nuclear reprocessing|fuel reprocessing]], it comes out as a component of the highly radioactive waste liquid. After sitting for several years, the radioactivity reduces to a level where extraction of the long-lived isotopes, including technetium-99, becomes feasible. A series of chemical processes yields technetium-99 metal of high purity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|pp=87–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Technetium-99m]] ("m" indicates that this is a [[Nuclear isomer#Metastable isomers|metastable]] nuclear isomer) is used in radioactive isotope [[nuclear medicine|medical tests]]. For example, Technetium-99m is a [[radioactive tracer]] that medical imaging equipment tracks in the human body.&lt;ref name=blocks/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-20150530/&gt; It is well suited to the role because it emits readily detectable 140&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|keV]] [[gamma ray]]s, and its half-life is 6.01&amp;nbsp;hours (meaning that about 94% of it decays to technetium-99 in 24&amp;nbsp;hours).&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; The chemistry of technetium allows it to be bound to a variety of biochemical compounds, each of which determines how it is metabolized and deposited in the body, and this single isotope can be used for a multitude of diagnostic tests. More than 50 common [[radiopharmaceuticals]] are based on technetium-99m for imaging and functional studies of the [[Human brain|brain]], heart muscle, [[thyroid]], [[Human lung|lungs]], [[liver]], [[gall bladder]], [[kidney]]s, [[Human skeleton|skeleton]], [[blood]], and [[tumor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longer-lived isotope, technetium-95m with a half-life of 61&amp;nbsp;days, is used as a [[radioactive tracer]] to study the movement of technetium in the environment and in plant and animal systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|pp=12–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial and chemical===
Technetium-99 decays almost entirely by beta decay, emitting beta particles with consistent low energies and no accompanying gamma rays. Moreover, its long half-life means that this emission decreases very slowly with time. It can also be extracted to a high chemical and isotopic purity from radioactive waste. For these reasons, it is a [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) standard beta emitter, and is used for equipment calibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technetium-99 has also been proposed for optoelectronic devices and [[nanotechnology|nanoscale]] [[nuclear battery|nuclear batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = 2006-11-30|title = University Research Program in Robotics REPORT|publisher = University of Florida|url = http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/895620-n4Nt3U/895620.PDF|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[rhenium]] and [[palladium]], technetium can serve as a [[catalyst]]. In processes such as the [[dehydrogenation]] of [[isopropyl alcohol]], it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium. However, its radioactivity is a major problem in safe catalytic applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|pp=87–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When steel is immersed in water, adding a small concentration (55&amp;nbsp;[[parts per notation|ppm]]) of potassium pertechnetate(VII) to the water protects the [[steel]] from corrosion, even if the temperature is raised to {{convert|250|C|K|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=corr&gt;{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=425}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, pertechnetate has been used as an anodic [[corrosion]] inhibitor for steel, although technetium's radioactivity poses problems that limit this application to self-contained systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Ch. 14 Separation Techniques |date=July 2004 |title=EPA: 402-b-04-001b-14-final |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency |chapter-url=http://www.epa.gov/radiation/docs/marlap/402-b-04-001b-14-final.pdf |chapter-format=PDF |accessdate=2008-08-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308042639/http://www.epa.gov/radiation/docs/marlap/402-b-04-001b-14-final.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While (for example) {{chem|CrO|4|2-}} can also inhibit corrosion, it requires a concentration ten times as high. In one experiment, a specimen of carbon steel was kept in an aqueous solution of pertechnetate for 20&amp;nbsp;years and was still uncorroded.&lt;ref name=corr/&gt; The mechanism by which pertechnetate prevents corrosion is not well understood, but seems to involve the reversible formation of a thin surface layer ([[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]). One theory holds that the pertechnetate reacts with the steel surface to form a layer of technetium [[oxide|dioxide]] which prevents further corrosion; the same effect explains how iron powder can be used to remove pertechnetate from water. ([[Activated carbon]] can also be used for the same purpose.) The effect disappears rapidly if the concentration of pertechnetate falls below the minimum concentration or if too high a concentration of other ions is added.&lt;ref name=s91/&gt;

As noted, the radioactive nature of technetium (3&amp;nbsp;MBq/L at the concentrations required) makes this corrosion protection impractical in almost all situations. Nevertheless, corrosion protection by pertechnetate ions was proposed (but never adopted) for use in [[boiling water reactor]]s.&lt;ref name=s91&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
Technetium plays no natural biological role and is not normally found in the human body.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads more readily than many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity. For example, no significant change in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15&amp;nbsp;µg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QLHr-UYWoo8C&amp;pg=PA392|pages=392–395|title=Technetium in the environment|author=Desmet, G.|author2=Myttenaere, C.|author3=Commission of the European Communities.

Office of Health and Environmental Research|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-85334-421-6|date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radiological toxicity of technetium (per unit of mass) is a function of compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope's half-life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|pp=371–381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All isotopes of technetium must be handled carefully. The most common isotope, technetium-99, is a weak beta emitter; such radiation is stopped by the walls of laboratory glassware. &lt;!-- NEEDS CITE Soft [[X-ray]]s are emitted when the beta particles are stopped, but as long as the body is kept more than {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} away these should pose no problem. /NEEDS CITE --&gt; The primary hazard when working with technetium is inhalation of dust; such [[radioactive contamination]] in the lungs can pose a significant cancer risk. For most work, careful handling in a [[fume hood]] is sufficient, and a [[glove box]] is not needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uranium boride''' (UB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a compound of [[uranium]] and [[boron]], is a very stable [[amorphous solid|glassy]] [[boride]] material that is insoluble in water.

It is being explored as a method of immobilising [[uranium]]-based [[radioactive waste]], and rendering it safe for long term storage. Some applications in [[endocurietherapy]], a method of [[radiation therapy]] where in [[radioactive]] microspheres are implanted directly into the treatment site and allowed to remain for an extended period of time, may also use this class of material as it would not be attacked while ''[[in situ]]''.

[[File:Vapor pressure being used in a cloud chamber.jpg|thumb|If vapor pressure exceeds the [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] value, [[condensation]] occurs in presence of [[nucleation]] sites. This principle is used in [[cloud chamber]]s, where [[particles]] of [[radiation]] form [[condensation]] tracks when passing through]]
[[File:02.Пиштол епрувета со алкохол.ogv|thumb|right|280px|The "Pistol Test Tube" experiment. The tube contains [[alcohol]] and is closed with a piece of cork. By heating the alcohol, the vapors fill in the space, increasing the pressure in the tube to the point of the cork popping out.]]

'''Vapor pressure''' (or vapour pressure in British spelling) or '''equilibrium vapor pressure''' is defined as the [[pressure]] exerted by a [[vapor]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its [[Condensation|condensed]] [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s (solid or liquid) at a given temperature in a [[Thermodynamic system#Closed system|closed system]]. The equilibrium vapor pressure is an indication of a liquid's [[evaporation]] rate. It relates to the tendency of particles to escape from the liquid (or a solid). A substance with a high vapor pressure at normal temperatures is often referred to as ''[[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]]''. The pressure exhibited by vapor present above a liquid surface is known as vapor pressure. As the temperature of a liquid increases, the kinetic energy of its molecules also increases. As the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, the number of molecules transitioning into a vapor also increases, thereby increasing the vapor pressure.

The vapor pressure of any substance increases non-linearly with temperature according to the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]]. The [[atmospheric pressure]] [[boiling point]] of a liquid (also known as the [[normal boiling point]]) is the temperature at which the vapor pressure equals the ambient atmospheric pressure. With any incremental increase in that temperature, the vapor pressure becomes sufficient to overcome [[atmospheric pressure]] and lift the liquid to form vapor bubbles inside the bulk of the substance. [[liquid bubble|Bubble]] formation deeper in the liquid requires a higher temperature due to the higher fluid pressure, because fluid pressure increases above the atmospheric pressure as the depth increases. More important at shallow depths is the higher temperature required to start bubble formation. The surface tension of the bubble wall leads to an overpressure in the very small, initial bubbles. Thus, thermometer calibration should not rely on the temperature in boiling water.

The vapor pressure that a single component in a mixture contributes to the total pressure in the system is called [[partial pressure]]. For example, air at sea level, and saturated with water vapor at 20&amp;nbsp;°C, has partial pressures of about 2.3 kPa of water, 78 kPa of [[nitrogen]], 21 kPa of [[oxygen]] and 0.9 kPa of [[argon]], totaling 102.2 kPa, making the basis for [[atmosphere (unit)|standard atmospheric pressure]].

==Measurement and units==
Vapor pressure is measured in the standard units of [[pressure]]. The [[International System of Units]] (SI) recognizes pressure as a [[SI derived unit|derived unit]] with the dimension of force per area and designates the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa) as its standard unit. One pascal is one [[newton (unit)|newton]] per [[square meter]] (N·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; or kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Experimental measurement of vapor pressure is a simple procedure for common pressures between 1 and 200 kPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capec.kt.dtu.dk/documents/overview/Vapor-pressure-Ruzicka.pdf |title=Vapor Pressure of Organic Compounds. Measurement and Correlation |author1=Růžička, K. |author2=Fulem, M. |author3=Růžička, V. |lastauthoramp=yes |access-date=2009-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226095004/http://www.capec.kt.dtu.dk/documents/overview/Vapor-pressure-Ruzicka.pdf |archive-date=2010-12-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most accurate results are obtained near the boiling point of substances and large errors result for measurements smaller than {{gaps|1|kPa}}. Procedures often consist of purifying the test substance, isolating it in a container, evacuating any foreign gas, then measuring the equilibrium pressure of the gaseous phase of the substance in the container at different temperatures. Better accuracy is achieved when care is taken to ensure that the entire substance and its vapor are at the prescribed temperature. This is often done, as with the use of an [[isoteniscope]], by submerging the containment area in a liquid bath.

Very low vapor pressures of solids can be measured using the [[Knudsen effusion cell]] method.

In a medical context, vapor pressure is sometimes expressed in other units, specifically [[Millimeter of mercury|millimeters of mercury (mmHg)]]. This is important for [[volatile anesthetics]], most of which are liquids at body temperature, but with a relatively high vapor pressure. Anesthetics with a higher vapor pressure at body temperature will be excreted more quickly, as they are exhaled from the lungs.

==Estimating vapor pressures with Antoine equation==

The [[Antoine equation]]&lt;ref name=frostburg&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/liquids/faq/antoine-vapor-pressure.shtml What is the Antoine Equation?] (Chemistry Department, [[Frostburg State University]], [[Maryland]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sinnot&gt;{{cite book|author=Sinnot, R.K.|title=Chemical Engineering Design]|edition=4th|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2005|page=331|isbn=0-7506-6538-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJaxUL3numgC&amp;pg=PA331 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a mathematical expression of the relation between the vapor pressure and the temperature of pure liquid or solid substances. The basic form of the equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\log P = A-\frac{B}{C+T}&lt;/math&gt;

and it can be transformed into this temperature-explicit form:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{B}{A-\log P} - C&lt;/math&gt;

where: &lt;span style="vertical-align:+12%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the absolute vapor pressure of a substance&lt;br&gt;
:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="vertical-align:+15%;"&gt;&lt;span style="vertical-align:+12%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the temperature of the substance&lt;/span&gt;
:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="vertical-align:+12%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="vertical-align:+12%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="vertical-align:+12%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are substance-specific coefficients (i.e., constants or parameters)
:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="vertical-align:-30%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\log&lt;/math&gt; is typically either &lt;math&gt;\log_{10}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\log_e&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=Sinnot/&gt;

A simpler form of the equation with only two coefficients is sometimes used:

:&lt;math&gt;\log P = A-\frac{B}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

which can be transformed to:

Sublimations and vaporizations of the same substance have separate sets of Antoine coefficients, as do components in mixtures.&lt;ref name=frostburg/&gt; Each parameter set for a specific compound is only applicable over a specified temperature range. Generally, temperature ranges are chosen to maintain the equation's accuracy of a few up to 8–10 percent. For many volatile substances, several different sets of parameters are available and used for different temperature ranges. The Antoine equation has poor accuracy with any single parameter set when used from a compound's melting point to its critical temperature. Accuracy is also usually poor when vapor pressure is under 10 Torr because of the limitations of the apparatus used to establish the Antoine parameter values.

The Wagner equation&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last= Wagner|first= W.|title= New vapour pressure measurements for argon and nitrogen and a new method for establishing rational vapour pressure equations|journal= Cryogenics|volume= 13|issue= 8|pages= 470–482 |year= 1973|doi=  10.1016/0011-2275(73)90003-9|bibcode = 1973Cryo...13..470W }}&lt;/ref&gt; gives "one of the best"&lt;ref&gt;Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook, 7th Ed. pp. 4–15&lt;/ref&gt; fits to experimental data but is quite complex.

==Relation to boiling point of liquids==
{{further|Boiling point}}
[[Image:vapor_pressure_chart.svg|thumb|right|A log-lin vapor pressure chart for various liquids]]
As a general trend, vapor pressures of liquids at ambient temperatures increase with decreasing boiling points. This is illustrated in the vapor pressure chart (see right) that shows graphs of the '''vapor pressures versus temperatures''' for a variety of liquids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book||editor=Perry, R.H. |editor2=Green, D.W. |title=[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]|edition=7th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1997|isbn= 0-07-049841-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the normal boiling point of a liquid, the vapor pressure is equal to the standard atmospheric pressure defined as 1 atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Petrucci, Ralph H. |author2=Harwood, William S. |author3=Herring, F.Geoffrey |title=General Chemistry |edition=8th|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2002|isbn= 0-13-014329-4|page=484}}&lt;/ref&gt; (760 Torr or 101.325 kPa or 14.69595 PSI).

For example, at any given temperature, [[methyl chloride]] has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart. It also has the lowest normal boiling point (−24.2&amp;nbsp;°C), which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride (the blue line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere ([[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]) of absolute vapor pressure.

Although the relation between vapor pressure and temperature is non-linear, the chart uses a logarithmic vertical axis to produce slightly curved lines, so one chart can graph many liquids. A nearly straight line is obtained when the logarithm of the vapor pressure is plotted against 1/(T+230)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Dreisbach, R. R.  |author2=Spencer, R. S. |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Infinite Points of Cox Chart Families and dt/dP Values at any Pressure|journal=Industrial and Engineering Chemistry,|volume=41|number=1|page=176|date= 1949|doi=10.1021/ie50469a040}}&lt;/ref&gt; where T is the temperature in degrees Celsius. The vapor pressure of a liquid at its boiling point equals the pressure of its surrounding environment.

==Liquid mixtures==
[[Raoult's law]] gives an approximation to the vapor pressure of mixtures of liquids. It states that the activity (pressure or [[fugacity]]) of a single-phase mixture is equal to the mole-fraction-weighted sum of the components' vapor pressures:

:&lt;math&gt; P_{\rm tot} =\sum_i P y_i = \sum_i P_i^{\rm sat} x_i \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_{\rm tot}&lt;/math&gt; is the mixture's vapor pressure, &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mole fraction]] of component &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the liquid phase and &lt;math&gt;y
_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mole fraction]] of component &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the vapor phase respectively. &lt;math&gt;P_i^{\rm sat}&lt;/math&gt; is the vapor pressure of component &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Raoult's law is applicable only to non-electrolytes (uncharged species); it is most appropriate for non-polar molecules with only weak intermolecular attractions (such as [[London force]]s).

Systems that have vapor pressures higher than indicated by the above formula are said to have positive deviations. Such a deviation suggests weaker intermolecular attraction than in the pure components, so that the molecules can be thought of as being "held in" the liquid phase less strongly than in the pure liquid. An example is the [[azeotrope]] of approximately 95% ethanol and water. Because the azeotrope's vapor pressure is higher than predicted by Raoult's law, it boils at a temperature below that of either pure component.

There are also systems with negative deviations that have vapor pressures that are lower than expected. Such a deviation is evidence for stronger intermolecular attraction between the constituents of the mixture than exists in the pure components. Thus, the molecules are "held in" the liquid more strongly when a second molecule is present. An example is a mixture of trichloromethane (chloroform) and 2-propanone (acetone), which boils above the boiling point of either pure component.

The negative and positive deviations can be used to determine [[thermodynamic activity]] coefficients of the components of mixtures.

==Solids==
[[Image:Vapor Pressure Curve of Liquid and Solid Benzene.png|thumb|300px|Vapor pressure of liquid and solid benzene]]
Equilibrium vapor pressure can be defined as the pressure reached when a condensed phase is in equilibrium with its own vapor. In the case of an equilibrium solid, such as a [[crystal]], this can be defined as the pressure when the rate of [[sublimation (physics)|sublimation]] of a solid matches the rate of deposition of its vapor phase. For most solids this pressure is very low, but some notable exceptions are [[naphthalene]], [[dry ice]] (the vapor pressure of dry ice is 5.73 MPa (831 psi, 56.5 atm) at 20 °C, which causes most sealed containers to rupture), and ice. All solid materials have a vapor pressure. However, due to their often extremely low values, measurement can be rather difficult. Typical techniques include the use of [[thermogravimetry]] and gas transpiration.

There are a number of methods for calculating the sublimation pressure (i.e., the vapor pressure) of a solid. One method is to estimate the sublimation pressure from extrapolated liquid vapor pressures (of the supercooled liquid), if the [[Enthalpy of fusion|heat of fusion]] is known, by using this particular form of the Clausius–Clapeyron relation:&lt;ref name="Moller"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Moller B. |author2=Rarey J. |author3=Ramjugernath D. |title=Estimation of the vapour pressure of non-electrolyte organic compounds via group contributions and group interactions|journal=Journal of Molecular Liquids|volume=143|pages=52|doi=10.1016/j.molliq.2008.04.020 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ln\,P^{\rm sub}_{\rm s} = \ln\,P^{\rm sub}_{\rm l} - \frac{\Delta_{\rm fus}H}{R} \left( \frac{1}{T_{\rm sub}} - \frac{1}{T_{\rm fus}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where:

* &lt;math&gt;P^{\rm sub}_{\rm s}&lt;/math&gt; is the sublimation pressure of the solid component at the temperature &lt;math&gt; T_{\rm sub} &lt; T_{\rm fus} &lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt; P^{\rm sub}_{\rm l}&lt;/math&gt; is the extrapolated vapor pressure of the liquid component at the temperature &lt;math&gt; T_{\rm sub} &lt; T_{\rm fus} &lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\rm fus}H &lt;/math&gt; is the heat of fusion.
* &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gas constant]].
* &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm sub}&lt;/math&gt; is the sublimation temperature.
* &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm fus}&lt;/math&gt; is the melting point temperature.

This method assumes that the heat of fusion is temperature-independent, ignores additional transition temperatures between different solid phases, and it gives a fair estimation for temperatures not too far from the melting point. It also shows that the sublimation pressure is lower than the extrapolated liquid vapor pressure (Δ&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;''H'' &gt; 0) and the difference grows with increased distance from the melting point.

==Boiling point of water==
[[Image:Water vapor pressure graph.jpg|thumb|right|Graph of water vapor pressure versus temperature. At the normal boiling point of 100 °C, it equals the standard atmospheric pressure of 760 [[Torr]] or 101.325 [[kPa]].]]
{{main|Vapor pressure of water}}
Like all liquids, water boils when its vapor pressure reaches its surrounding pressure. In nature, the atmospheric pressure is lower at higher elevations and water boils at a lower temperature. The boiling temperature of water for atmospheric pressures can be approximated by the [[Antoine equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\log_{10}P = 8.07131 - \frac{1730.63}{233.426 + T_b}&lt;/math&gt;

or transformed into this temperature-explicit form:

:&lt;math&gt;T_b = \frac{1730.63}{8.07131 - \log_{10}P} - 233.426&lt;/math&gt;

where the temperature &lt;math&gt;T_b&lt;/math&gt; is the boiling point in degrees [[Celsius]] and the pressure &lt;math&gt;P_{ } &lt;/math&gt; is in [[Torr]].

==Dühring's rule==
{{main|Dühring's rule}}
Dühring's rule states that a linear relationship exists between the temperatures at which two solutions exert the same vapor pressure.

==Meaning in meteorology==
In [[meteorology]], the term ''vapor pressure'' is used to mean the partial pressure of [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, even if it is not in equilibrium,&lt;ref&gt;[http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=vapor-pressure1 Glossary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415075010/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=vapor-pressure1 |date=2011-04-15 }} (Developed by the [[American Meteorological Society]])&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''equilibrium vapor pressure'' is specified otherwise. Meteorologists also use the term ''saturation vapor pressure'' to refer to the equilibrium vapor pressure of water or [[brine]] above a flat surface, to distinguish it from equilibrium vapor pressure, which takes into account the shape and size of water droplets and particulates in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fermi.jhuapl.edu/people/babin/vapor/index.html A Brief Tutorial]. jhuapl.edu (An article about the definition of equilibrium vapor pressure)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''waterside hot water hay pellet furnace''' is technology that was developed to convert [[grass]] and [[hay]] into energy that can used in [[home heating]], also known as grass pellet heating.&lt;ref name ="Jones" &gt;Jones, H. (2008, Aug 21). NS farmer has an answer to energy and greenhouse gas problems.  Farm Focus of Atlantic Canada. Retrieved from http://www.atlanticfarmfocus.ca/NB-NL-NS-PEI/2008-08-21/article-1054532/NS-farmer-has-an-answer-to-energy-and-greenhouse-gas-problems/1&lt;/ref&gt;

The waterside hot water hay pellet furnace was invented by Gus Swanson a farmer from [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name="CBC" &gt;CBC (2011, Sept 13). Farmers learn about converting grass into fuel. CBC News. Retrieved from http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2011/09/13/ns-grass-pellets-heat.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Swanson came up with the idea after search for an affordable alternative to home heating to oil after the price of oil began to increase.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt; Swanson and two of his partners, Philip Landry and Jim Trussler, founded the company LST Energy Inc. as a way to grow and build their hay pellet furnace technology.&lt;ref name=kelly&gt;Kelly, S. (2010, Jan 28). Pictou County Company wins a $100,000 Prize. Farm Focus of Atlantic Canada. Retrieved from http://www.atlanticfarmfocus.ca/NBNLNSPEI/2010-01-28/article-1055307/Pictou-County-company-wins-100000-prize/1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and method of operation==

The waterside hot water hay pellet furnace converts hay pellets into energy by burning them in a furnace, [[wood stove]], or pellet stove.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; The hay pellets are made from dried field hay (grass) that is harvested at the end of season and then pressed into pellets.&lt;ref name=Goodwin&gt;Goodwin, S. (2008, Sept 2). Farmer says he’s found a way to create heat from hay. The Advocate. Retrieved from http://www.pictouadvocate.com/2008/09/02/farmer-says-he%E2%80%99s-found-a-way-to-create-heat-from-hay/&lt;/ref&gt;

Swanson developed a furnace with a local Pictou furnace maker, a Cape Breton company that makes pellet machines, and scientists at the [[Nova Scotia Agricultural College]].&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt; While developing the furnace Swanson and his team had problems related to the building up of glass that was produced when the hay was burning in the furnace. This is because hay contains sand and [[potassium chloride]], sometimes referred to as clinkers,&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt; and its ashes are heavy. Therefore, when the hay is burning in the furnace the sand turns into glass that can be up to an inch thick and this was causing problems because the glass would build up enough that it was putting the fire out(which was the energy created by the burning of the hay). Thus, Swanson and his team had to find a way to break the newly formed glass back into sand. It took 10 different prototype burning pots before one was created that had an ash breaker that would work.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

The temperature in the water chamber of the furnace can reach the boiling point within seven minutes and at that rate the furnace can burn off the majority of the ash and leave little waste.&lt;ref name=Goodwin /&gt;
Once development was complete on the furnace the final working prototype of the Waterside Hay Hot Water Pellet Furnace was 45&amp;nbsp;inches tall and around a foot in diameter. It can burn 50 – 125 pounds of pellets a day and releases 30,000 – 190,000 BTU's (British thermal units) an hour.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

It is estimated that it will take 8,100 square metres of grass to heat an average Canadian home per year.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt;

===Key partners in development===

Swanson and his company have received grants to help assist in the patent and safety certificate testing from Agri-Futures Nova Scotia, which is the provincial distributor of funds through Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada’s Advancing Canadian Agriculture and Agri-Food (ACAAF) Program.&lt;ref name=Goodwin /&gt;

LST Energy Inc. received a $100,000 prize offered by Innovacorporation for winning first place in a regional technology start-up competition in 2010.&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt;

The Nova Scotia Agricultural College has been helping LST energy Inc. on the development of the hay pellet furnace. In 2009, when LST Energy advanced to the final round of the regional technology start-up competition they had one of their completed prototypes installed and up and running at the Agricultural College.&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt;

A Musquodoboit, Nova Scotia company has been recruited to produce the hay pellets suitable for use in the furnace.&lt;ref name=Goodwin /&gt;

==Benefits==

Hay, which comes from grass, is an economically viable, renewable and sustainable resource.  Two acres of hay will heat an average home for the winter and it would only take 4% of Canadian land to produce enough hay to heat every Canadian home.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; 
The hay pellets used in the furnace are also an environmental friendly energy source.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; It is considered a carbon neutral energy source.&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt; The hay pellets burning efficiency is increased by its low moisture content and it burns without producing any smoke and as clean or cleaner than any fossil fuel.  Wood stoves release 45g of particulate/hour, while hay pellets only product 1.2g/hour.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

Research has been conducted to discover what type of grass is best suited for use in the Waterside Hot Water Hay Pellet Furnace and it was found the reed canary hay pellets, produced from reed canary grass is the most efficient grass pellet source. It emitted 90% less [[Carbon Dioxide]] (CO2) than heating oil, [[propane]] or [[natural gas]]. Eighteen thousand tonnes of CO2 can be saved from being emitted into the atmosphere for every 50 acres of reed canary grass burnt as hay pellets in the Waterside Hot Water Hay Pellet Furnace.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

It’s a potential new source of income for the struggling agricultural industry.&lt;ref name=Goodwin /&gt;  This new furnace also has the potential to strengthen the agricultural community in Canada because farmers may soon be able to sell their hay for pellet production. Farmers currently make $30/ton of hay, however it is predicted that if demand for hay increases because it is needed for pellet production that the farmers could potentially make up to $100/ton, with the consumer being charge $200/ton of pellets.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; Presently, one tonne of hay is equivalent to around $700 worth of heating oil.&lt;ref name=Goodwin /&gt; It is predicted that a farm in Nova Scotia with 100 acres of hay could make up to $50,000 a year selling their hay for production of pellets that will be used in the furnace.&lt;ref name=Goodwin /&gt; An increase in demand for pellets made out of hay could also potentially increase jobs available in rural farming areas across Canada.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt;

Heating a home with hay pellets is a much cheaper alternative to that of oil. Swanson currently heats a three-bedroom apartment, a two-bedroom apartment, and a two-bedroom house using hay pellets and it cost him only $300/month, compared to the $900/month it used to cost him when he was heating these properties with oil.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt;

The unity and continuity of the World Ocean, with relatively free interchange among its parts, is of fundamental importance to [[oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;Spilhaus, Athelstan F.  1942 (Jul.).  "Maps of the whole world ocean."  ''Geographical Review'' ([[American Geographical Society]]).  Vol. 32 (3): pp. 431-5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided into a number of principal oceanic areas that are delimited by the [[continent]]s and various oceanographic features: these divisions are the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Arctic Ocean]] (sometimes considered a [[sea]] of the Atlantic), [[Indian Ocean]], [[Pacific Ocean]], and [[Southern Ocean]], defined by the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO) in 2000, based on evidence that this region of the World Ocean has a distinct ecosystem and a unique impact on global climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Rosenberg | first=Matt | title=Do You Know the World's Newest Ocean? | website=ThoughtCo | date=May 1, 2005 | url=https://www.thoughtco.com/the-new-fifth-ocean-1435095 | ref=harv | access-date=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In turn, oceanic waters are interspersed by many smaller seas, gulfs, and bays.

A global ocean has existed in one form or another on Earth for eons, and the notion dates back to [[classical antiquity]] in the form of [[Oceanus]]. The contemporary concept of the ''World Ocean'' was coined in the early 20th century by the [[Russia]]n [[oceanography|oceanographer]] [[Yuly Shokalsky]] to refer to the continuous ocean that covers and encircles most of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Ecocritical Shakespeare (Literary and Scientific Cultures of Early Modernity) | publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd | author=Bruckner, Lynne and Dan Brayton | year=2011 | isbn=978-0754669197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If viewed from the southern pole of Earth, the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans can be seen as lobes extending northward from the Southern Ocean. Farther north, the Atlantic opens into the Arctic Ocean, which is connected to the Pacific by the [[Bering Strait]], forming a continuous expanse of water.

* The [[Pacific Ocean]], the largest of the oceans, also reaches northward from the Southern Ocean to the Arctic Ocean. It spans the gap between [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] and [[Asia]], and the [[Americas]]. The Pacific Ocean meets the Atlantic Ocean south of [[South America]] at [[Cape Horn]].
* The [[Atlantic Ocean]], the second largest, extends from the Southern Ocean between the [[Americas]], and [[Africa]] and [[Europe]], to the Arctic Ocean. The Atlantic Ocean meets the Indian Ocean south of Africa at [[Cape Agulhas]].
* The [[Indian Ocean]], the third largest, extends northward from the Southern Ocean to [[India]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and [[Southeast Asia]] in Asia, and between [[Africa]] in the west and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] in the east. The Indian Ocean joins the Pacific Ocean to the east, near Australia.
* The [[Arctic Ocean]] is the smallest of the five. It joins the Atlantic Ocean near [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]] and joins the Pacific Ocean at the [[Bering Strait]]. It overlies the [[North Pole]], touching [[North America]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]] and [[Scandinavia]] and [[Siberia]] in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. The Arctic Ocean is partially covered in [[sea ice]], the extent of which varies according to the season.  
* The [[Southern Ocean]] is a proposed [[ocean]] surrounding [[Antarctica]], dominated by the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], generally the ocean south of 60 degrees south latitude. The Southern Ocean is partially covered in [[sea ice]], the extent of which varies according to the season. The Southern Ocean is the second smallest of the five named oceans.

[[Plate tectonics]], [[post-glacial rebound]], and [[sea level rise]] continually change the coastline and structure of the world ocean.
