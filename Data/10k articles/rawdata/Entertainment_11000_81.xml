{{About|the tournament system used in the Australian Football League since 2000|the Australian Football League finals series itself|AFL finals series}}
The '''AFL final eight system''' is an eight-team championship [[playoff]] [[tournament]] developed and adopted by the [[Australian Football League]] in the 2000 season. The eight teams, which are ranked or seeded in advance of the tournament, participate in a four-week tournament, with two teams eliminated in each of the first three weeks. The [[grand final]] is played in the fourth week between the two remaining teams, with the winning team awarded the premiership.

The system is designed to give the top four teams an easier road to the Grand Final than the second four teams. The top four teams need to win only two finals to reach the Grand Final, while the second four teams need to win three. The two winning teams of the top four receive a [[bye (sports)|bye]] in the second week of the playoff and then play at home in the third week, and the two losing teams play at home in the second week.

The AFL introduced the system in 2000 to address several perceived issues with the [[McIntyre Final Eight System]] that had been in use in that competition from 1994–1999. The system has also been adopted by the [[Victorian Football League]] and the [[National Rugby League]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrl.com/nrls-mcintyre-finals-system-scrapped/tabid/10874/newsid/65961/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Similar systems are used by [[Super League]], and were previously used by the [[Australian Rugby League]] in the 1995 and 1996 seasons.

&lt;/center&gt;

==Finals format==
===Week one===
* 1st Qualifying Final: 1st ranked team hosts 4th ranked team
* 2nd Qualifying Final: 2nd ranked team hosts 3rd ranked team
* 1st Elimination Final: 5th ranked team hosts 8th ranked team
* 2nd Elimination Final: 6th ranked team hosts 7th ranked team

The eight finalists are split into two groups for the opening week of the Finals Series.  The top four teams have the best chance of winning the premiership and play the two Qualifying Finals.  The winners get a bye through to Week Three of the tournament to play home Preliminary Finals, while the losers play home Semi-Finals in Week Two.  The bottom four teams play the two Elimination Finals, where the winners advance to Week Two away games and the losers' seasons are over.

===Week two===
* 1st Semi-final:&lt;ref name="semi-final"&gt;Under the AFL finals series, the term "semi-final" has different usage to that a traditional [[knock out tournament]]. The two games played immediately before the Grand Final, which would be known as semi-finals in a knock out tournament, are called "preliminary finals". The semi-finals refer to the two games preceding the preliminary finals. This unusual terminology is a consequence of retaining aspects of the terminology used under the [[McIntyre System]]s from 1931 until 1993, when only one preliminary final was played.&lt;/ref&gt; Loser of 1st QF hosts winner of 1st EF
* 2nd Semi-final: Loser of 2nd QF hosts winner of 2nd EF

===Week three===
* 1st Preliminary Final:&lt;ref name="semi-final" /&gt; Winner of 1st QF hosts winner of 2nd SF
* 2nd Preliminary Final: Winner of 2nd QF hosts winner of 1st SF

===Week four===
* Grand Final: Winner of 1st PF meets Winner of 2nd PF.

==Advantages for ladder positions==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Under this finals system, the final eight teams are broken up into two halves of four teams which are in turn split into two pairs each. The higher a team's position on the ladder, the greater benefits they receive. The top half of the ladder has two key advantages. These teams only need to win twice to reach the Grand Final (either a Qualifying or Semi-Final and a Preliminary Final), and they have the benefit of the '''double-chance'''; since the Qualifying Final is non-elimination, losers still have a second chance to reach the Grand Final by winning their two other Finals. Teams in the top six get the benefit of at least one home final; the top two teams play two home finals.

A team's final rank in the home-and-away season also determines their pairings for the first week. In the Qualifying Finals, 1st place plays 4th place and 2nd place plays 3rd place; in the Elimination Finals, 5th place plays 8th place and 6th place plays 7th place. The better a team's rank, the more advantageous (or less disadvantageous) the matchup. After the first week, matchups are determined directly by the results of the previous week.

===First and second===
The top two seeds '''host''' their ''first two'' finals: the Qualifying Final and whatever final they play next (Preliminary Final if they win, Semi-Final if they lose). They also have the benefit of only needing to win twice to reach the Grand Final. If they win the Qualifying Final, they earn the bye to the Preliminary Final; otherwise they get the '''double-chance''' and can still reach the Preliminary Final by winning the Semifinal.

===Third and fourth===
The next two seeds '''visit''' for the Qualifying Final but then '''host''' their next final. Like the top two, these teams only need to win twice to reach the Grand Final. Winning the Qualifying Final earns them the bye to the Preliminary Final; losing gives them the '''double-chance''' via the Semi-Final.

===Fifth and sixth===
Fifth and sixth place '''host''' their Elimination Final and '''visit''' any other finals they reach. These teams must win ''all three'' of their finals (Elimination, Semi-, and Preliminary Finals) to avoid elimination.

===Seventh and eighth===
The last two teams '''visit''' throughout the finals and also must win ''all three'' of their finals to avoid elimination.

'''''Abyss Odyssey''''' is a [[platform game|platform]] [[action-adventure game]] developed by [[ACE Team]] and published by [[Atlus]]. It was released in North America on 15 July 2014 and Europe on 16 July 2014 for the [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. An ''Extended Dream Edition'' for the [[PlayStation 4]] was released on 28 July 2015.

The game's plot follows a set of heroes who fight to reach a warlock whose dreams are infecting reality in late 19th century [[Santiago]], [[Chile]]. ''Abyss Odyssey'' combines elements from multiple video game genres and has a unique art style based on the [[Art Nouveau]] movement. It received mostly positive reviews from critics who praised its atmosphere but criticized some aspects of gameplay.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Abyss Odyssey - Screenshot 06.jpg|thumb|left|The game's developers described ''Abyss Odyssey''{{'}}s fighting style as "a bit like ''[[Street Fighter (series)|Street Fighter]]'' meets ''[[Super Smash Bros. (series)|Super Smash Bros.]]''"&lt;ref name="rockpapershotguninterview"/&gt;]]

The gameplay has a fusion of elements from a number of gaming genres.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt; The player controls an avatar who battles enemies and advances through dungeons to reach the conclusion of the stage. The game's levels are [[procedural generation|procedurally generated]], providing a new experience on each.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; The player only has one life but may be revived.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt; If the player character dies, the player is put in control of a much weaker human who tries to avenge their death and can revive the player at specific altars.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;

The game's fighting system combines elements of the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' and ''[[Street Fighter]]'' franchises,&lt;ref name="rockpapershotguninterview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; and rewards players for timing their blocks and attacks at the right moment.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt; Players can capture the souls of enemies they encounter—once collected, a player can then assume the form and abilities of the enemy in-game.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt; ''Abyss Odyssey'' uses a community-based unlock system; upon its launch, only the first "phase" of the game was available. After a certain number of players defeat the game's final boss, the Warlock, the next phase of the game is unlocked for all players.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Abyss Odyssey - Screenshot 01.jpg|thumb|left|The art was inspired by the works of [[Harry Clarke]]]]

ACE Team revealed ''Abyss Odyssey'' on their official blog on 4 March 2014.&lt;ref name="ACEblog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Abyss Odyssey revealed!|author=Bordeu, Andres|date=4 March 2014|publisher=ACE Team Blog |url=http://forums.aceteam.cl/index.php?autocom=blog&amp;blogid=2&amp;showentry=108|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers were inspired by the [[Art Nouveau]] movement and they used [[Harry Clarke]] as a direct reference for much of the game's art and atmosphere.&lt;ref name="rockpapershotguninterview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zeno Clash Dev On Abyss Odyssey's Procedural Insanity|author=Grayson, Nathan|date=7 March 2014|publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/03/07/zeno-clash-dev-on-abyss-odysseys-procedural-insanity/|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers intended the game to be extremely replayable and designed the combat mechanics to be simple to understand, after initially considering a more complicated fighting layout.&lt;ref name="rockpapershotguninterview" /&gt;

An Enhanced Edition titled ''Abyss Odyssey: Extended Dream Edition'' introduced competitive multiplayer as well as new types of enemies and bosses to the game and was released for the [[PlayStation 4]] on 28 July 2015. A "nightmare" difficulty mode is included in the Enhanced Edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-08-abyss-odyssey-extended-dream-edition-announced-for-ps4|title=Abyss Odyssey: Extended Dream Edition announced for PS4|first=Jeffery|last=Matulef|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=8 May 2015|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews for ''Abyss Odyssey'' were mixed; the game received a 69% from [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Abyss Odyssey for PC Reviews|website=Metacritic |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/abyss-odyssey|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics praised the game's art style and atmosphere, but were disappointed by some of its game mechanics and its repetitive nature.

[[Eurogamer]]'s Dan Whitehead praised the game's visuals and new ideas in a positive review, but felt that there was a "... sense that in straddling so many genres, the game has spread itself a little thin"&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Abyss Odyssey review|author=Whitehead, Dan |date=24 July 2014 |publisher=Eurogamer|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-07-24-abyss-odyssey-review|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]]'s Richard Cobbett compared the game's [[roguelike]] elements unfavorably to ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'' and ''[[Spelunky]]'', but noted that "the soundtrack is fantastic, and the art is even better."&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Abyss Odyssey Review|author=Whitehead, Dan |date=24 July 2014 |website=IGN |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/24/abyss-odyssey-review|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hardcore Gamer]]'s James Cunningham likened the art style to "playing a Grateful Dead album cover" and called it "a quirky little gaming gem"&lt;ref name="HG"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cunningham |first=James |url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/07/15/review-abyss-odyssey/94283/ |title=Review: Abyss Odyssey |publisher=Hardcore Gamer |date=15 July 2014 |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reception to the combat system was mixed. [[Destructoid]]'s Alasdair Duncan felt that the combat system was "enjoyable and deep" and provided one of the main reasons to play the game, while ''[[PC Gamer]]'''s Emanuel Maiberg derided what he felt to be the game's sluggish control input and compared the game negatively to the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series that its fighting system is based on.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Abyss Odyssey|author=Duncan, Alasdair |date=15 July 2014 |publisher=Destructoid |url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-abyss-odyssey-277987.phtml|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCgamer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Abyss Odyssey review|author=Maiberg, Emanuel |date=18 July 2014 |work=PC Gamer |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/review/abyss-odyssey-review/|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Action Transfers''', also known as '''rub-on transfers''', were an art-based children's pastime that was extremely popular throughout the world from the 1960s to the 1980s. They consisted of a printed [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] background image and a transparent sheet of coloured [[dry transfer]] figures of people, animals, vehicles, weapons, explosions and so on. These transfers were supposed to be applied to the background scene by rubbing the top surface of the transparent sheet with a hard object or stylus; typically, this would mean a ball-point pen or a pencil; the figure would thereby be transferred from its sheet to the background. Since it was not customary to determine exactly where the transfers should be applied, surreal or comic effects could be achieved—whether deliberately or inadvertently—by juxtaposing the transfers and the background inappropriately. It was also possible to apply the transfer figures elsewhere than on the supplied background, and conversely it is quite common to come across finished transfer sets in which the descriptive lettering from the sheets has been applied to the background; an effect not intended by the manufacturer.

A number of different sets were distributed by a wide variety of companies between the late 1960s and the 1980s; these included sets based on popular comics and cartoons (e.g., [[DC Comics]], [[Marvel Comics]], [[Hanna Barbera]], and [[Walt Disney|Disney]] cartoons), television series and movies (e.g., ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''), as well as original content sets. Since Letraset had a patent monopoly on the dry rub-down transfer process, until the end of the 1970s any transfers supplied with these sets would have been printed by Letraset, firstly at [[Waterloo Road, London|Waterloo Road]] in [[London]], then later at [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] in [[Kent]], and finally at their factory in [[Italy]].

==History==
[[Image:Letraset-boegen.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Typographic character sheets made by Letraset (left) and similar product made by a rival (right).]]
[[Letraset]], the company that developed the [[Instant Lettering]] transfer sheets that dominated design and publishing before the advent of [[desktop publishing]], created the first dry rub-down transfer sets for children and marketed them as "[[Instant Pictures]]" in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Instant Pictures|url=http://www.action-transfers.com/html/a_ranges/busybees_linking.shtml|website=www.action-transfers.com/|publisher=Action Transfers|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were originally [[silk screen]] printed and monochromatic, but by 1966 they were being produced using four spot colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Panoramas|url=http://www.action-transfers.com/html/a_ranges/panoramas_linking.shtml|website=www.action-transfers.com/|publisher=Action Transfers|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Instant Pictures after 1965 were produced for either [[John Waddington Ltd.]] or [[Patterson Blick]].

Letraset purchased a [[rotary gravure]] press which they installed at Ashford in Kent, and there they produced true full-colour transfers for the first time starting in 1967. These were not strictly [[CMYK]] colour transfers, because white ink is also required—since transfers are printed on transparent plastic, and not on white paper.

In 1969 the first Action Transfer sets were produced in this way, initially with a range of twelve sets—although the range rapidly expanded. Letraset stopped using the title "Instant Pictures" and from then on referred to their own transfers as "Action Transfers", even if they were not actually in the range of sets originally given that name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.action-transfers.com/html/a_a/chronology.shtml Action Transfers: the Chronology]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the production of Action Transfers was transferred to Letraset's Italian factory, [[Sodecor]], where offset litho printing was used with transfers for the first time. The impetus for the move was a joint venture undertaken with [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] to produce Action Transfers under the name Kalkitos. These were widely distributed around the world, with the brand name occasionally differing; in the US, they were known as [[Presto Magix]].

After the acquisition of Letraset by [[Esselte]] in 1981, the production of transfers was continued by a British company named [[Acorn Printed Products]], that was formed by several ex-Letraset staff members. Acorn still produce transfers to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acorn Printed Products|url=http://www.action-transfers.com/html/a_ranges/acorn.shtml|website=www.action-transfers.com|publisher=Action Transfers|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Adventure Pinball: Forgotten Island''''' is a [[pinball]] [[video game]] released in [[2001 in video gaming|2001]] by [[Electronic Arts]] for [[Microsoft Windows]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Adventure pinball screenshot.png|thumb|left|250px|A pinball about to be launched into play on the first level of the game, Ooga's House. A pinball multiplier can be seen to the left, which ultimately earns you move lives.]] The game uses the [[Unreal engine]]&lt;ref name="EA Pinball"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinball.ea.com/ |title=Official Site |accessdate=2009-02-04 |work=[[Electronic Arts]] |author= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201172431/http://pinball.ea.com/ |archivedate=1 February 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was previously only used for first-person shooter games. It provided a fresh new gameplay experience for its time, especially in the aspect of [[:Category:Pinball video games|pinball games]]. The game is rendered in 3-D, and has both a story mode consisting of 9 levels, where no actual pinball tables exist, and a table mode. Most of the levels must be unlocked by completing other levels. There are hidden areas in the story mode to earn bonus points, it also features special power-ups to help your progression through the game.

[[Image:Adventure pinball screenshot 2.png|thumb|left|250px|Attempting to complete a goal in story mode involving Waterbugs, one of its unique features and differences from previous pinball games.]]The game was unlike any other pinball game at the time, it wasn't just your average game of pinball behind a glass case or a video game simulation, you were able to roam around a small world known as The Forgotton Island. It also featured monsters and insects to eliminate or bypass while playing in story mode. It is known at times for being a very fast-paced game.&lt;ref name="CNET Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/pc-games/adventure-pinball-forgotten-island/4505-9696_7-30771556.html|title=CNET Review |accessdate=2009-03-04 |work=[[CNET]] |author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Adventure pinball screenshot 3.png|thumb|left|250px|Story mode features unique gems to collect throughout the levels for special power-ups. A ruby gem is found here in a mushroom cave.]]In addition to the instruction manual, a booklet is provided with the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version of the game that includes a short story in the appearance of the main character's personal journal.  It hints of a possible sequel at the end of the story by saying "I have the feeling there's more adventure to come", but this hasn't been confirmed or announced yet.

==Levels==
The levels for story mode and table mode are the same, but the difference is story mode offers quests and objectives to unlock new levels for both story mode and table mode, opposed to table mode which is used to set a high score for each level.

'''''Arsenic Lullaby''''' is a [[comic book]] series written and illustrated by [[Douglas Paszkiewicz]], proclaimed "King of Dark Humor" by ''Previews'' magazine. It is known for combining horror and taboo subjects with humor and satire.

Among other groundbreaking content, it was the first to introduce a cartoon fetus.  Its most regularly featured character Voodoo Joe, a witchdoctor living in the suburbs, created several zombie fetuses as diminutive assistants.

Paszkiewicz continues to publish ''Arsenic Lullaby'' sporadically while working on cartoon storyboards and contributing to ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine, ''Mad Kids'', and other publications. This magazine has been reprinted and circulated by Greek publisher Jemma Press, where it was quickly nominated for the Comicdom Award in Europe.

Paszkiewicz often uses phonetic spelling in his dialogue to convey the flavor of different regional colloquialisms, eras, and nationalities.

''Arsenic Lullaby'' has also been nominated for the top honors in the comic book industry, the EISNER AWARD for "Best Humor Publication", the Harvey Award, and the Comicdom Award in Europe.

In 2012, its successful kickstarter campaign laid the groundwork for a wave of independently published comic books to see print without using the standard means of comic book distribution. 

''Arsenic Lullaby'' also had a story animated in Comedy Central's TRIP TANK.

==Characters==
* '''Voodoo Joe''', a man cursed to help ordinary people get revenge
* '''The Clot''', a man who was diagnosed with a deadly skin bacteria and had to have all of his skin removed
* '''Baron Von Donut''', an immortal alcoholic mascot whose magical powers bring him back to life to give donuts to children, no matter what happened to him the previous day.
* a dozen zombie fetuses that Voodoo Joe liberated from an abortion clinic dumpster
* '''The Great Duranti''', a stage magician who has sold his soul to Satan to become the most powerful magician on earth.  He uses the powers for petty gifting schemes to fund his vaudeville show.
* '''Old man Hutchenson''', a government clerk kept alive against his will in a cybernetic suit, charged with the duty of remembering top secret information deemed too precious to risk loading into a computer.

==Related works==
''Arsenic Lullaby'' sparked four spin-off series by Paszkiewicz: ''Laughter of the Damned'' (3 issues), ''Misery A Go Go'' (1 issue), ''Arsenic Lullabies'' (2 issues), ''The Thousand Deaths of Baron Von Donut'' (1 issue), and ''Arsenic Lullaby Pulp Edition'' (magazine size) – Summer 2007.

Paszkiewicz has gone on to work on a reprint of ''The Gift #1'', in which there is an ''Arsenic Lullaby''-like story in the last seven pages, Pete the P.O.'s Postal Worker, ''Mad Magazine'' and others.

The '''Belgian Comic Strip Center''' ({{lang-fr|Centre belge de la Bande dessinée}}; {{lang-nl|Belgisch Stripcentrum}}) is a museum in [[Brussels]], located in the Rue des Sables /Zandstraat 20, dedicated to [[Belgian comics]].

==History of the building==

The building was designed in 1905 by world-famous architect [[Victor Horta]] in [[Art Nouveau]] style and served as a textile department store, the ''Magasins Waucquez''. After Waucquez's death in 1920, the building began to languish away, and in 1970, the firm closed its doors. Jean Delhaye, a former aid of Horta, saved the building from demolition, and by 16 October 1975, it was designated as a protected monument. Still, the building was in bad shape and victim to a lot of vandalism.&lt;ref name="tento.be"&gt;http://www.tento.be/sites/default/files/tijdschrift/pdf/OKV1992/Belgisch%20Centrum%20van%20het%20Beeldverhaal%20Brussel.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, architect [[Jean Breydel]] and comics artists [[François Schuiten]], [[Bob de Moor]], [[Alain Baran]], [[Guy Dessicy]] and [[Hergé]] planned to restore the building and give it a new destination as a museum dedicated to the history of [[Belgian comics]]. Originally, the museum would be a homage to Hergé, but he suggested honoring the entire Belgian comics industry. In 1983, Belgian Minister of Public Works Louis Olivier decided that the building would be bought by the Direction of Buildings, making it national property.&lt;ref name="tento.be"/&gt; In 1984, a fund was founded which brought together several Flemish and Walloon comics artists. Two years later, the restorations began, with respect for the original architecture, while updating it to modern standards. The [[mosaic|mosaics]] were flown over from Italy and constructed by Italian mosaic workers, because the profession had become obsolete in Belgium.&lt;ref name="tento.be"/&gt;

On 6 October 1989, the museum was inaugurated in the presence of King [[Baudouin of Belgium]] and Queen [[Fabiola of Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brussels.be/artdet.cfm/6697&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Autumn of 2015, the museum started redecorating its permanent exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stripmuseum.be/nl/tentoonstellingen/permanente-tentoonstellingen/de-hergeruimte&lt;/ref&gt;

==The museum==

On the ground floor of the museum, a restaurant can be found, a room dedicated to Victor Horta, a comics' store named "Slumberland" after ''[[Little Nemo in Slumberland]]'',&lt;ref name="brusselsmuseums.be"&gt;http://www.brusselsmuseums.be/en/museum/14-belgian-comic-strip-center&lt;/ref&gt; a [[library]] with a reading room and a study centre. The first floor has an [[auditorium]], a room with original comic book pages by various artists and a room dedicated to [[animation]], more specifically the Belgian animation industry, such as [[Belvision]].&lt;ref name="tento.be"/&gt;

The second floor has a permanent exhibition dedicated to the chronological history of the medium in Belgium called "The Museum of Imagination".&lt;ref name="brusselsmuseums.be"/&gt; The exhibit starts off with [[Hergé]] and ends with [[Peyo]], covering the pioneers of Belgian comics between 1929 and 1958 and with special focus on the magazines ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' and ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]''. Each artist has a room dedicated to his work and designed in a playful way.&lt;ref name="tento.be"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= | first= | title=Drawing room: The Belgian Comic Strip Center: Tintin | date=15 October 2011 | newspaper=The Independent | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/tintin-2371058.html?action=gallery&amp;ino=18 | accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final floor is dedicated to the [[merchandising]] of comics and available for provisional exhibitions.&lt;ref name="tento.be"/&gt;

==List of the exhibited comics artists==

Four artists exhibited are Flemish: [[Willy Vandersteen]], [[Marc Sleen]], [[Bob de Moor]] and [[Morris (cartoonist)|Morris]]. The rest are Walloon, except for [[Jacques Martin (comics)|Jacques Martin]] and [[Tibet (comics)|Tibet]] who were born in France, but published in ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]''.

'''Bullwinkle's Restaurant''', also known as '''Family Fun Center''', is a chain of family entertainment centers.  Similar to most locations feature a sit-down restaurant, complemented by [[arcade game]]s, [[go-kart]]s, [[bumper boats]], [[mini golf]], [[laser tag]], [[ropes course]], [[zip line]], and small rides for children, themed after its namesake, ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]''.

== Arcade ==
Bullwinkle's features a card swipe / token operated [[Amusement arcade]] section featuring over 100 popular video games and redemption games such as ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time]]'', ''[[The Simpsons Arcade|The Simpsons  Game]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day (arcade game)|Terminator 2: Judgement Day arcade game]]''.  They also have games which are played for tickets, such as [[Skeeball]] and Basketball.  The tickets can then be redeemed at a prize counter for various prizes.

== Restaurant ==
[[File:Bullwinkles Restaurant.JPG|right|thumb|Bullwinkle's Restaurant dining room]]
The restaurant section of Bullwinkle's has a log cabin feel inspired by the ''[[Dudley Do-Right]]'' cartoon. The walls and support beams are made of logs and the floor has red carpeting, upon which sits many long wooden tables with wooden benches. A family can sit at one of these tables and order food from a small menu. The main fare usually includes pizza and burgers, as well as wraps and salads. The restaurant is also a popular place for the birthday parties of elementary school children, as they can play in the arcade until the food is ready.

Bullwinkle's Restaurant features live entertainment of [[animatronic]] renditions of ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'' characters. The big red curtains open revealing the whole crew, including Bullwinkle, Rocky, Boris and Natasha and some other characters who were on the show.  The characters then put on a variety show with songs and comedy.

**  [[Fountain Valley, California]]
** [[Vista, California]] and
**[[Sunnyvale, California]] 
** [[Medford, New York]] on Long Island. 

While Bullwinkle's Restaurant is not well known in California outside of the [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]]/[[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] community, there are other Bullwinkle's Restaurants in [[Wilsonville, Oregon]] and [[Tukwila, Washington]]. 

There were Bullwinkle's in the following municipalities: 
* [[Richmond, Virginia]]
* [[Federal Way, Washington]]
* [[Atlanta, Georgia]]
* [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] 
* [[Cary, North Carolina]]
* [[Juneau, Alaska]]

The Bullwinkle's in Edmonton and Calgary, Alberta were popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s until they were closed. 

These restaurants are all described as "Family Fun Centers" in addition to "Bullwinkle's Restaurant".

A '''''chanson''''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃɑ̃sɔ̃}}, "[[song]]", from [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:cantio#Latin|cantio]]'', [[genitive case|gen]]. ''cantionis'') is in general any [[Lyrics|lyric]]-driven French song, usually [[polyphonic]] and [[secular]]. A singer specializing in chansons is known as a "chanteur" (male) or "[[chanteuse]]" (female); a collection of chansons, especially from the [[late Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], is also known as a [[chansonnier]].

==''Chanson de geste''==
{{main|Chanson de geste}}
The earliest ''chansons'' were the [[epic poem]]s performed to simple [[Monophony|monophonic]] melodies by a professional class of ''[[jongleur]]s'' or ''[[Minstrel|ménestrels]]''. These usually recounted the famous deeds (''geste'') of past heroes, legendary and semi-historical. The ''[[Song of Roland]]'' is the most famous of these, but in general the ''chansons de geste'' are studied as literature since very little of their music survives.

==''Chanson courtoise''==
{{main|Grand chant}}
The ''chanson courtoise'' or ''grand chant'' was an early form of monophonic ''chanson'', the chief lyric poetic genre of the [[trouvère]]s. It was an adaptation to [[Old French]] of the [[Occitan]] ''[[Canso (song)|canso]]''. It was practised in the 12th and 13th centuries. Thematically, as its name implies, it was a song of [[courtly love]], written usually by a man to his noble lover. Some later ''chansons'' were polyphonic and some had [[refrain]]s and were called ''chansons avec des refrains''. A [[Crusade song]] was known as a ''chanson de croisade''.

==Burgundian ''chanson''==
{{see also|Motet-chanson}}
In its typical specialized usage, the word ''chanson'' refers to a polyphonic French song of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. Early ''chansons'' tended to be in one of the ''[[formes fixes]]''—[[ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]], [[Rondeau (forme fixe)|rondeau]] or [[virelai]] (formerly the ''chanson baladée'')—though some composers later set popular poetry in a variety of forms. The earliest chansons were for two, three or four voices, with first three becoming the norm, expanding to four voices by the 16th century. Sometimes, the singers were accompanied by [[musical instrument|instruments]].

The first important composer of ''chansons'' was [[Guillaume de Machaut]], who composed three-voice works in the ''formes fixes'' during the 14th century. [[Guillaume Dufay]] and [[Gilles Binchois]], who wrote so-called Burgundian ''chansons'' (because they were from the area known as [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]), were the most important chanson composers of the next generation (c. 1420–1470). Their chansons, while somewhat simple in style, are also generally in three voices with a structural tenor. Musicologist David Fallows includes the Burgundian repertoire in ''A Catalogue of Polyphonic Songs 1415–1480.'' These works are typically still 3 voices, with an active upper voice (discantus) pitched above two lower voices (tenor and altus) usually sharing the same range.

Later 15th- and early 16th-century figures in the genre included [[Johannes Ockeghem]] and [[Josquin des Prez]], whose works cease to be constrained by ''formes fixes'' and begin to feature a pervading imitation (all voices sharing material and moving at similar speeds), similar to that found in contemporary [[motet]]s and liturgical music. The first book of music printed from movable type was ''[[Harmonice Musices Odhecaton]]'', a collection of ninety-six chansons by many composers, published in Venice in 1501 by [[Ottaviano Petrucci]].

==Parisian ''chanson''==
Beginning in the late 1520s through mid-century, [[Claudin de Sermisy]], [[Pierre Certon]], [[Clément Janequin]], and [[Philippe Verdelot]] were composers of so-called Parisian ''chansons'', which also abandoned the ''formes fixes'',{{clarify|date=July 2017}}&lt;!--What else did they abandon besides the "formes fixes", and what are these things, anyway?--&gt; often featured four voices, and were in a simpler, more [[homophonic]] style. This genre sometimes featured music that was meant to be evocative of certain imagery such as birds or the marketplace. Many of these Parisian works were published by [[Pierre Attaingnant]]. Composers of their generation, as well as later composers, such as [[Orlando de Lassus]],{{clarify|date=July 2017}}&lt;!--Did this Orlande de Lassus write Parisian chansons, or what?--&gt; were influenced by the Italian [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]. Many early instrumental works were ornamented variations (diminutions) on chansons, with this genre becoming the [[canzone]], a progenitor of the [[sonata (music)|sonata]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Modern ''chanson''==
French solo song developed in the late 16th century, probably from the aforementioned Parisian works. During the 17th century, the ''[[air de cour]]'', ''[[chanson pour boire]]'' and other like genres, generally accompanied by lute or keyboard, flourished, with contributions by such composers as [[Antoine Boesset]], [[Denis Gaultier]], [[Michel Lambert]] and [[Michel-Richard de Lalande]].

During the 18th century, vocal music in France was dominated by [[opera]], but solo song underwent a renaissance in the 19th century, first with [[salon music|salon]] [[melodies]] and then by mid-century with highly sophisticated works influenced by the German [[Lied]]er, which had been introduced into the country. [[Louis Niedermeyer]], under the particular spell of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], was a pivotal figure in this movement, followed by [[Édouard Lalo]], [[Felicien David]] and many others.

Another offshoot of ''chanson'', called ''[[chanson réaliste]]'' (realist song), was a popular musical genre in France, primarily from the 1880s until the end of World War II.&lt;ref name=VICTORY&gt;Sweeney, Regina M. (2001). ''Singing Our Way to Victory: French Cultural Politics and Music During the Great War'', Wesleyan University Press. p. 23. {{ISBN|0-8195-6473-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MONTREAL&gt;Fagot, Sylvain &amp; Uzel, Jean-Philippe (2006). ''Énonciation artistique et socialité: actes du colloque international de Montréal des 3 et 4 mars 2005'', L'Harmattan. pp. 200–203. {{ISBN|2-296-00176-9}}. (French text)&lt;/ref&gt;  Born of the ''[[Café-chantant|cafés-concerts]]'' and [[cabarets]] of the [[Montmartre]] district of [[Paris]] and influenced by literary realism and the naturalist movements in literature and theatre, ''chanson réaliste'' was a musical style which was mainly performed by women and dealt with the lives of Paris's poor and working class.&lt;ref name=VICTORY/&gt;&lt;ref name=SPHINX&gt;Wilson, Elizabeth (1992). ''The Sphinx in the City: Urban Life, the Control of Disorder, and Women'', University of California Press. p. 62. {{ISBN|0-520-07864-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CHANTEUSE&gt;Conway, Kelly (2004). ''Chanteuse in the City: The Realist Singer in French Film''. University of California Press. p. 6. {{ISBN|0-520-24407-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Among the better-known performers of the genre are [[Marie-Louise Damien|Damia]], [[Fréhel]], and [[Édith Piaf]].

Later 19th-century composers of French [[art song]]s, known as [[mélodie]] and not chanson, included [[Ernest Chausson]], [[Emmanuel Chabrier]], [[Gabriel Fauré]], and [[Claude Debussy]], while many 20th-century and current French composers have continued this strong tradition.

==Nouvelle ''chanson''==
[[File:Radio Libertaire 10 ans Léo Ferré 3.jpg|thumb|right|230px|French singer-songwriter and anarchist [[Léo Ferré]], in 1991.]]
{{Main|Nouvelle Chanson}}
In [[France]] today "chanson" or "chanson française" typically refers to the music of singers such as [[Charles Trenet]], [[Guy Béart]], [[Jacques Brel]], [[Jean Ferrat]], [[Georges Brassens]], [[Édith Piaf]], [[Charles Aznavour]], [[Barbara (singer)|Barbara]], [[Dalida]], [[Serge Reggiani]], [[William Sheller]], [[Renaud]], [[Léo Ferré]], [[Mireille Mathieu]] and [[Serge Gainsbourg]] and more recently [[Juliette (French singer)|Juliette]], [[Mano Solo]], [[Dominique A]], [[Matthieu Chedid]], [[Benjamin Biolay]], [[Jean-Louis Murat]], [[Miossec]], [[Mathieu Boogaerts]], [[Daniel Darc]], [[Vincent Delerm]], [[Maurane]], [[Zaz (singer)|Zaz]], [[Bénabar]], [[Renan Luce]], [[Olivia Ruiz]]. Chanson can be distinguished from the rest of French "pop" music by following the rhythms of French language, rather than those of English, and a higher standard for lyrics.

== Museum ==
In [[La Planche]], [[Loire-Atlantique]], the [[Musée de la chanson française]] has been established in 1992. The museum has the goal to remember the artists that have established the heritage of the chanson.&lt;ref&gt;Danièle Clermontel and Jean-Claude Clermontel, Chronologie scientifique, technologique et économique de la France], [https://books.google.nl/books?id=LQ4hwJPYdoIC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;lpg=PA321#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 321], {{ISBN|9782748346824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
{{Poemquote|Our ''Scene'' is ''London'', 'cause we would make known,
No country's mirth is better than our own.
No clime breeds better matter, for your whore,
Bawd, squire, imposter, many persons more|author=Ben Jonson|title=''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (1610).}}
Emerging from [[Ben Jonson]]'s late-[[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] [[Comedy of humours|comedies of humours]] (1598–1599), the conventions of city comedy developed rapidly in the first decade of the [[Jacobean era]], as one playwright's innovations were soon adopted by others, such that by about 1605 the new genre was fully established.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon (1980, 1–2). Gibbon's book, the first full-length study of the genre, was first published in 1968 and was substantially revised, to address a broader audience and to update its conclusions in relation to subsequent scholarship, in a second edition that was published in 1980; see Gibbons (1980, Preface). The genre had been described and defined in earlier, broader surveys; see, for example, [[M. C. Bradbrook]]'s ''The Growth and Structure of Elizabethan Comedy'' (1955), chapter nine (1955, 138–164).&lt;/ref&gt; Its principal playwrights were Jonson himself, [[Thomas Middleton]], and [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], though many others also contributed to its development, including [[Thomas Heywood]], [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]], [[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]], and [[John Webster]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon (1980, 2, ''et passim'').&lt;/ref&gt; Once the companies of [[boy player]]s—the [[Children of Paul's]] and the [[Children of the Chapel]]—had resumed public performances from 1600 onwards, most of their plays were city comedies.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon (1980, 1).&lt;/ref&gt; The closest that [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays come to the genre is the slightly earlier ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' (c. 1597), which is his only play set entirely in England; it avoids the caustic satire of city comedy, however, in preference for a more bourgeois mode (with its duel romantic plots governed by socio-economics not love or sex), while its setting, [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], is a town rather than a city.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin (2008, 160); see also, Howard (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the adventurous chronicles of Elizabethan comedy, such as [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]]'s ''[[The Shoemaker's Holiday]]'' (1599) or [[George Peele]]'s ''[[The Old Wives' Tale]]'' (c. 1590), or the intricately plotted romantic comedies of Shakespeare and [[John Lyly]], city comedy was more realistic (excluding magical or marvellous elements) and sharp and [[Satire|satirical]] in tone.&lt;ref name=gibbons1&gt;Gibbons (1980, 1).&lt;/ref&gt; It portrayed a broad range of characters from different ranks (often focused on citizens), employing "deeds and language such as men do use", as Jonson put it, and was usually set in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Jonson, Preface to ''[[Every Man in his Humour]]'' (1598).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Tudor period]] the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] had produced a gradual shift to [[Protestantism]] and much of London passed from church to private ownership.&lt;ref name=pevsner&gt;Pevsner (1962, 48).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] was founded in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Burgon and Wilson (1839).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mercantilism]] grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the [[East India Company]] were established, with trade expanding to the [[New World]]. London became the principal [[North Sea]] port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; City comedies depict London as a hotbed of vice and folly; in particular, Jonson's ''[[Epicoene]]'', Middleton's ''A Trick to Catch the Old One'' and ''[[A Chaste Maid in Cheapside]]'', and Marston's ''The Dutch Courtesan.''

Verna Foster has argued that John Ford's ''[['Tis Pity She's a Whore]]'' (c. 1629–1633) re-works many of the features of city comedy within a tragic drama.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Craneballs Studio''' is a video game development company based in the [[Czech Republic]]. It was founded in 2008. The company originally focused on webdesign and making graphics. It started to develop video games near the end of 2008 due to the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. Its first video game was released in 2009 and was financially successful. Its other games were successful too, so the studio has grown from three people to around 20.&lt;ref&gt;http://startup.lupa.cz/clanky/craneballs-studios-ke-splneni-snu-vyvijet-hry-je-privedla-krize/ Czech&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.appliste.cz/hry-zpusobujici-zavislost-21/ Czech&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Darkspore''''' was a [[video game]] that borrowed creature editing technology from ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]''. It was described as "a fast-paced, [[science fiction]] [[action role-playing game]] in which the player battled across alien worlds to save the galaxy from the mutated forces of Darkspore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A NEW BREED OF ACTION RPG |url=http://darkspore.com/overview |work=Darkspore |publisher=Electronic Arts Inc |accessdate=10 July 2012 |author=Electronic Arts Inc |year=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702152955/http://darkspore.com/overview |archivedate=2 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the creature editor, the game features a unique squad-based mechanic, various [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] options, and a [[player versus player]] arena. The game was released in North America on April 26, 2011 for [[Microsoft Windows]], and in Europe on April 28, 2011.

EA has removed the store page of ''Darkspore'' from [[Steam (software)|Steam]], meaning any attempt to purchase it through Steam cannot be made. The game was later relisted with EA saying that they would continue to support for the game. Those who have purchased it prior to the page's removal still have the game and could play it until the servers were shut down permanently on March 1, 2016. The game is currently unplayable due to its [[Always-on DRM|DRM scheme requiring a connection]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gera|first1=Emily|title=Darkspore removed from Steam after months of game breaking issues (update)|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/7/1/4482108/darkspore-removed-from-steam-after-months-of-game-breaking-issues|website=Polygon|publisher=Polygon|accessdate=October 4, 2014|date=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The Crogenitors were a race of scientists that established a massive empire encompassing an entire galaxy.
Many of them performed secret experiments on the populations they oversaw. Being masters of [[Genetics|genetic]] manipulation, they used their knowledge to create a personal army of genetic heroes, called ''Living Weapons''. However, the discovery of an experimental [[amino acid]] that bonds to DNA changes everything. Capable of achieving a millennium in terms of evolution in a matter of hours, it has an immense potential to manipulate [[life]] to levels never achieved before.

Unfortunately, ''E-DNA'' proves to be unstable. All of the test subjects who came in contact with it were transformed into uncontrollable genetic mutants soon named ''The Darkspore''. Fearing these new creatures, the Crogenitors throw hero ''Xylan'' into exile for his behavior and negligence, outlawing the use of E-DNA. Xylan fakes his death. Believing himself able to control the power of E-DNA, he injects it himself. This act transforms him into the ''Corruptor'' — a mentally unstable, extraordinarily powerful mutant who can master all Darkspores. Determined to get revenge on the other Crogenitors and conquer everything, he gathers allies and strengthens the E-DNA mutagenic power. Afterwards, the Corruptor begins conquering planets of the '''Crogenitor''' empire, [[infection|infecting]] them through the use of E-DNA bombs, and destroying Crogenitor fortresses with his mutants and war machines.

As the game begins, the player takes on the role of one of the last Crogenitors. Starting with only a few heroes, the player's goal is to purge the Darkspore from the galaxy, planet by planet, moving ever closer to the ultimate goal of destroying the Corruptor forces.

==Hero Editor==
{{See also|Spore Creature Creator}}
The Hero editor in ''Darkspore'' has been described as an enhanced version of [[Spore (2008 video game)#Editors/creators|the one found in Spore]]. There are thousands of parts to collect which enhance the overall gaming experience.The different types of parts include enabling the customization of several character aspects, including body parts, armor, weapons, facial features and coloration. The hero remains recognizable but customisable. To buy and equip the loot or buy upgrades, DNA is necessary, used as a currency. DNA helixes can be collected during gameplay, dropped sometimes by slayed Darkspores or destructible objects, or obtained by selling pieces of loot.

==Alternate reality game==
''HelpEDNA'' was a Darkspore [[alternate reality game]] that went online in mid-2010. It plays out as a puzzle text adventure which gives clues about the Darkspore game, and is set before the events of the game.

HelpEDNA is a puzzle text adventure, in which you play as a contact that has begun receiving messages from an unknown character. After the game is completed, it contains an epilogue page containing a message from [[Maxis]], with links to all the pictures and videos from the website.

==Online==
In addition to a [[product key]] registration, Darkspore required a persistent, [[Broadband Internet access#Broadband access|broadband]] internet connection and an EA account in order to play the game after installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/darkspore-requires-constant-internet-connection-on-pc-196271.phtml |title=Darkspore requires constant Internet connection (Update) |publisher=Destructoid |date=2006-03-16 |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013 many users had problems logging in to play. This combined with Darkspore being removed from Steam led to concerns that EA had abandoned the title and it would no longer be playable. However, shortly after, the errors were fixed and Darkspore returned to Steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Purchese|first=Robert|title=Has EA abandoned Darkspore?|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-01-has-ea-abandoned-darkspore|publisher=Eurogamer|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;However, the game has since been removed from all stores, making storehouse sales such as eBay and Amazon the only options for people looking to buy the game. The game's online features continued to be supported for some time for people who already own it. 
===March 2016 server closure===
The online servers of the game were shutdown permanently on March 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/darkspore-will-close-for-good-next-week/|title=Darkspore will close for good next week|first=Andy|last=Chalk|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=February 24, 2016|accessdate=February 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is no longer playable. The move attracted criticism, with Techraptor stating that the failure to migrate away from the always-online requirement before the server shutdown was tantamount to "banishing the title from gaming history."&lt;ref&gt;http://techraptor.net/content/ea-shuts-down-darkspore-servers&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=July 2016}}
Darkspore has received mixed reviews, with an average of 65% on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/darkspore |title=Darkspore on Metacritic |publisher=Metacritic |date=2011-04-26 |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''See [[digital television]] for more technical details, or [[DTV transition in the United States]] for specific information related to the analogue-to-digital switchover''

In [[Malaysia]], [[digital television]] broadcasts, DTV or DHD, can be received via [[cable television|cable]], [[internet television|internet]], [[satellite television|satellite]], or via free [[terrestrial television|over-the-air]] (OTA) [[digital terrestrial television]] - much like analogue television broadcasts have been. It began in the mid-1990s with the introduction of the [[Astro (satellite TV)|Astro]] satellite television service, now followed by new [[pay television|paid television]] services in the 2000s, as well as the [[digital terrestrial television|digitalisation of over-the-air TV]] which was expected to be complete by the mid-2010s before being shelved. This article discusses various platforms where DTV is applied in Malaysia, including [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB) ([[DVB-S]] for [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[DVB-T]] for [[terrestrial television|over-the-air]]) and [[IPTV|Internet Protocol Television (IPTV)]].

== DTV systems ==

=== Satellite television ===
The DTV era in Malaysia began with the introduction of [[direct broadcast satellite|direct broadcast]] [[pay television]] service, Astro, in 1996 as part of [[commercialization of space|commercialisation of space]]. Astro now transmits about 130 local and international TV channels in the [[MPEG-2]] video format through the [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] utilising the [[MEASAT]] satellite system's [[transponder]]s, according to the [[DVB-S]] standard. Astro's transmission is especially susceptible to [[rain fade]], and complaints of interruption during wet weather are not uncommon in Malaysia with a [[tropical climate]]. On December 2011, the former prime minister [[Najib Tun Razak]] announced that free satellite television, [[NJOI]] will be available to customer starting February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Digital terrestrial TV===

====Free-to-air====
In 2005, the Ministry of Information announced their plan to digitalise nationwide [[free-to-air]] TV broadcasts led by [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia]] (RTM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200510/06/eng20051006_212641.html|title=Malaysia to launch digital TV trial program|date=6 October 2005|accessdate=21 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trial broadcasts were undertaken, involving one thousand households in the [[Klang Valley]] from September 2006 till February 2007. According to the then-Deputy Minister of Information, [[Chia Kwang Chye]], the trial received "very positive" feedback, i.e. "more than 60 percent said the quality of the signal ranged from good to better. Over 88 percent said the picture quality improved, while 70 percent said the sound quality was better."&lt;ref name="abu"&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysia adopts DVB-T standard for digital broadcast transmissions|url=http://www.dvb.org/about_dvb/dvb_worldwide/malaysia/index.xml|publisher=[[Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union|ABU]]|date=28 March 2007|accessdate=21 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Information Minister Datuk [[Ahmad Shabery Cheek]], it was anticipated that RTM would fully complete its digitalisation in 2012 as part of its three-year restructuring process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Malaysia and all other [[ASEAN]] nations (with the exception of [[The Philippines]], who selected ISDB instead) had selected [[DVB-T]] as the final DTV standard, and were expected to switch off [[analogue television|analogue broadcasts]] completely by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ASEAN picks DVB-T as common TV standard |url=http://www.apb-news.com/index.php?option=com_magazine&amp;func=show_article&amp;id=110&amp;Itemid=1 |date=17 June 2005 |accessdate=21 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714214051/http://www.apb-news.com/index.php?option=com_magazine&amp;func=show_article&amp;id=110&amp;Itemid=1 |archivedate=14 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2008, participants of the 6th ASEAN Digital Broadcast Meeting from seven [[south-east Asia]]n countries (including Malaysia) agreed to finalise the specifications of the DTV [[set-top box]] for use within ASEAN, and also set up an ASEAN HD Centre to provide training on HDTV content to broadcasters in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Asean Broadcasters Prepare For Digital Broadcasting |publisher=[[Bernama]] (Ministry of Information) |date=19 June 2008 |url=http://www.moi.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1570&amp;Itemid=109 |accessdate=21 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220060750/http://www.moi.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1570&amp;Itemid=109 |archivedate=20 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a success of RTM's pilot trials, the digital terrestrial television transition faced many problems. These problems stemmed from the lesser enthusiasm of content providers toward the digitisation, with the exception of [[Les' Copaque Production|Les Copaque]], and the need to improve the nation's [[Internet]] broadband infrastructure. However, after [[Abdullah Badawi]] resigned as Prime Minister and succeeded by [[Najib Tun Razak]] in 2008, the project by RTM was deferred indefinitely.

==== Future ====
Although Telekom Malaysia has been rumoured to be builder for a digital terrestrial television infrastructure, TM wishes to improve the broadband infrastructure to increase Internet readiness for the country, which leads to [[UniFi]].

On 8 January 2014, Puncak Semangat was awarded the concession for digital terrestrial television development. The company is obligated to develop the digital terrestrial television infrastructure, which include a digital multimedia hub and a network of high, medium and low-powered digital TV transmitters nationwide that are capable of carrying up to 45 standard-definition or 15 high-definition digital TV channels, for a start. Television and radio services will be offered first while the latter three, connected services (catch-up TV and video on demand), t-commerce (television commerce) and soft services (e-learning applications and SMS voting) will delivered via home broadband networks after the former two.&lt;ref name="happening" /&gt;

The first roll-out will start on 16 April 2015 (originally expected to be in the third quarter of 2014),&lt;ref name="happening"&gt;{{cite news|title=The move to digital TV broadcast is happening|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Tech/Tech-News/2014/06/03/DTT-broadcast-to-hit-in-2015/|accessdate=21 December 2014|newspaper=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star Online]]|date=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; using Puncak Semangat's inside-out rollout strategy where the rural areas will have analogue switch-off first followed by suburbans and eventually urban areas in stages, due to the fact that free-to-air television will benefit rural people while people in urban and suburban areas already have pay television such as [[Astro (television)|Astro]] and [[HyppTV]].&lt;ref name="happening" /&gt; The rollout will complete in 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DTTB due by 2017|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/1220149|accessdate=21 December 2014|newspaper=The Sun|date=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will cover 98% of Malaysia's population with the capacity of up to 80 television channels and between 30 and 40 radio stations.&lt;ref name="happening" /&gt;

Once the full digital platform has been rolled out, television broadcasts in analogue will be terminated.&lt;ref name="Malaysian digital television"&gt;{{cite news|title=MCMC picks Puncak Semangat to operate digital tv broadcast service in Malaysia|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/925379|accessdate=6 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Sun (Malaysia)|The Sun]]|date=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Analogue switch-off====
Analogue TV broadcasts would have been shut down in stages, due to complete by 2014 as per recommendation from ASEAN. The DTT migration plan was divided into three phases:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fulfilling Needs for Digital Media|author=Ahmad Nasruddin Atiqullah Fakrullah|pages=15|publisher=.my Convergence|year=2008|url=http://myconvergence.com.my/main/images/stories/PDF_Folder/MYC02_Fulfilling%20Needs%20For%20Digital%20Media.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407123716/http://myconvergence.com.my/main/images/stories/PDF_Folder/MYC02_Fulfilling%20Needs%20For%20Digital%20Media.pdf|archivedate=7 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Phase I (2007–2013)
#* Analogue TV &amp; DTT co-exist
#* Analogue TV shut down in stages
#* Vacate other primary services ([[radar]] and [[Least mean squares filter|LMS]])
# Phase II (2014–30 March 2019)
#* No analogue TV service
#* Vacate DTT service using channels 56 and above
#* Vacate LMS in band 477&amp;nbsp;MHz to 478&amp;nbsp;MHz
# Phase III (31 March 2019-)
#* 100% DTT service using channels 5 to 12 and 21 to 54

Television broadcasts in analogue are originally scheduled for 2017, but the transition will be completed after the full-out of the digital platform.&lt;ref name="Malaysian digital television" /&gt;

====Paid terrestrial television====
In 2006, [[U Television]], formerly [[MiTV]], is scheduled to roll out broadcast services in the [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] video format according to [[DVB-T]], for better picture quality and more efficient frequency [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] usage, after having failed in an earlier venture with the IPTV-over-UHF system previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MiTV Awards RM115 Million Contract for the Latest Broadcast Technology Network |url=http://www.mitv.com.my/portal/news.asp |publisher=U Television Sdn Bhd (press release) |date=18 December 2006 |accessdate=21 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610173411/http://www.mitv.com.my/portal/news.asp |archivedate=10 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadband and IPTV===
[[DETV]], a new paid television provider owned by [[REDtone]], provides television and [[video-on-demand]] services on the [[IPTV]] platform, targeting the [[Chinese Malaysian|Chinese]] audiences in Malaysia.

[[Telekom Malaysia|TM]] launched its IPTV services, branded as [[Hypp.TV]] in the fourth quarter of 2009, and has completed its trials with 1,000 selected households in Klang Valley, [[Penang]] and [[Kulim]], [[Kedah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Goh, T. E. |title=TM sees IPTV commercial roll-out in 12 months |url=http://www.btimes.com.my/Current_News/BTIMES/Thursday/Nation/gohsg.xml/Article/index_html |publisher=[[Business Times (Kuala Lumpur)|Business Times]] |date=19 June 2008 |accessdate=21 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620093855/http://www.btimes.com.my/Current_News/BTIMES/Thursday/Nation/gohsg.xml/Article/index_html |archivedate=20 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The service began in March 2010. However, due to the service being tied down to their UniFi fiber-to-the-home service, availability remains limited to areas covered by the national fiber rollout.

===Mobile television===
[[Mobile television]] was introduced in Malaysia with [[video streaming]] services by mobile telecommunications providers such as [[Maxis]] and [[DiGi]], to users of [[mobile phone]]s with [[3G]] or similar technologies. Maxis TV now offers more than 20 channels to Maxis 3G subscribers who own compatible mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxis.com.my/3G/maxistv/maxistv.asp|title=Maxis 3G in Action - Maxis TV|accessdate=21 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516113145/http://www.maxis.com.my/3G/maxistv/maxistv.asp|archivedate=16 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, Maxis is expected to roll out broadcast mobile TV services based on [[DVB-H]] in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maxis completes DVB-H trial|url=http://www.mobileworld.com.my/v2/index.php/20070828335/Consumer/News/Maxis_completes_DVB-H_trial.html|publisher=Mobile World|date=28 August 2007|accessdate=21 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204075307/http://www.mobileworld.com.my/v2/index.php/20070828335/Consumer/News/Maxis_completes_DVB-H_trial.html|archivedate=4 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U Mobile]] also provides broadcast mobile TV to users of selected 3G phones, also based on DVB-H.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Timbuong, J.|title=U Mobile is newest cellular service provider|url=http://star-techcentral.com/tech/story.asp?file=/2007/9/20/technology/18926591&amp;sec=technology|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|date=20 September 2007|accessdate=21 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, Astro launched Astro Mobile TV&lt;ref name="New Astro contents"&gt;{{cite news|author=Mustapha Kamil |title=New Astro contents to pack a bigger punch |publisher=[[Business Times (Kuala Lumpur)|Business Times]] |date=13 October 2008 |url=http://www.btimes.com.my/Current_News/BTIMES/Monday/OurPick/astro12.xml/Article/ |accessdate=16 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021001511/http://www.btimes.com.my/Current_News/BTIMES/Monday/OurPick/astro12.xml/Article/ |archivedate=21 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which currently provides 18 channels, all of which are mobile versions of existing Astro TV channels, including seven in-house channels. This service is only available to Maxis subscribers with compatible [[2.5G]] or 3G handsets, and does not reprise its role from Maxis TV [[cable television]].

In 2012, HyppTV launched the HyppTV Everywhere service to counter the lack of fiber coverage. Initially only available to UniFi subscribers, the service was opened up to the public to compensate for the limited UniFi coverage.

==HDTV==
&lt;!--
HDTV broadcasts is hard to come by,&lt;ref&gt;http://star-techcentral.com/tech/story.asp?file=/2006/9/28/prodit/15541039&amp;sec=prodit&lt;/ref&gt; although the first HDTV sets hit electrical stores in the middle of the 2000s. Overtime, the sales of these sets rose higher as they have been sold rampantly.&lt;ref name="Malaysiakini.com"&gt;{{cite news|author=Ganesh|title=Plasma and LCD TV buyers beware!|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/letters/96826|date=20 January 2009|accessdate=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to consumer laws, a buyer cannot return the item claiming dissatisfaction with the fact that the item did not correspond to what was advertised in the first place in the shop.
--&gt;
RTM initiated its inaugural [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) trials in 2008, with the [[2008 Summer Olympics broadcasting|Beijing Olympic Games]], of which RTM test-broadcast the opening and closing ceremony, and several events on HD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radio TV M'sia transmitting Olympics in HD via RTM HD |publisher=@llo' Expat |date=11 August 2008 |url=http://www.alloexpat.com/malaysia_expat_forum/radio-tv-m-sia-transmitting-olympics-in-hd-via-rtm-hd-t21332.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823231915/http://www.alloexpat.com/malaysia_expat_forum/radio-tv-m-sia-transmitting-olympics-in-hd-via-rtm-hd-t21332.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 August 2008 |accessdate=16 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, Astro launched [[Astro B.yond]] as a [[personal video recorder]] and a [[high-definition television]] service.

As of July 2013, Media Prima group chief financial officer Mohamad Ariff Ibrahim told that Media Prima will launch high definition (HD) simulcast for one of its four terrestrial television stations as early as the first half of year 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theedgemalaysia.com/business-news/246878-media-prima-to-launch-hd-simulcast-in-1h2014.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130722135155/http://www.theedgemalaysia.com/business-news/246878-media-prima-to-launch-hd-simulcast-in-1h2014.html |archivedate=22 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; But, audiences are still suffered with SD resolution and stretched 4:3 scale format in most 16:9 TV that majority people own nowadays. Media Prima only start to broadcast selected programmes at 16:9 SD starting from 31 December 2016, however the idents, programme previews, adverts, 4:3 contents and some widescreen programmes remain on 4:3 and improperly stretched.

In early 2015, [[NJOI]] began the HD service that will automatically available for free for all NJOI customers starting from 1 February.

'''Dionysian imitatio''' is the influential [[literary method]] of imitation as formulated by Greek author [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the first century BCE, which conceived it as the [[rhetoric]]al practice of emulating, adapting, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"/&gt; It is a departure from the concept of [[mimesis]] which only is concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors."&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;

==History==
Three centuries after Aristotle's ''Poetics'', from the 4th century BCE to the 1st century BCE, the meaning of ''mimesis'' as a [[literary method]] had shifted from "imitation of nature" to "imitation of other authors".&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; No historical record is left to explain the reason of this change. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]]' three volume work ''On mimesis'' (''On imitation''), which was the most influential for Latin authors, is lost.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Most of it contained advice on how to identify the most suitable writers to imitate and the best way to imitate them.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"&gt;Ruthven (1979) pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"/&gt; For Dionysian ''imitatio'', the object of imitation was not a single author but the qualities of many.&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"&gt;West (1979) pp.5–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''; the imitation literary approach is closely linked with the widespread observation that "everything has been said already", which was also stated by Egyptian scribes around 2000 BCE. The ideal aim of this approach to literature was not [[originality]], but to surpass the predecessor by improving their writings and set the bar to a higher level.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; A prominent Latin follower of Dionysius was [[Quintilian]], who shared with him the view of ''imitatio'' as the practice that leads to an [[History of ideas|historical progress]] of literature over time.&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"/&gt; Both Dionysius and Quintilian discuss ''imitation'' exclusively from the point of view of rhetoric.&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"/&gt; In Quintilian, and in [[classical rhetoric]] in general, rhetoric drew much attention to the process of imitatio; the [[four operations of quadripartita ratio]] that organize all the [[figures of speech]], defined as a "ready-made framework" of "relatively mechanical procedures" for the emulation, adaptation, reworking and enrichment of a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen (2008), quote from the summary: {{quotation|The variety of ways to adapt and enrich source texts, as discussed by Erasmus in De Copia Rerum, are discussed in chapter 5. [...] Classical rhetoric had already developed a theory of these kinds of intervention, drawing attention to the process of adaptation [...] If a topic had been treated by an earlier author, this was no reason to avoid it, but one had to try to emulate one's predecessor. The use of rhetoric enabled authors to discuss the same topic in several ways, to be little a great subject, and to accord greatness to something small, for example, or to renew the old, and express the new in an old-fashioned manner. [...] Using these formulas, a pupil could render the same subject or theme in a myriad of ways. For the mature author, this principle offered a set of tools to rework source texts into a new creation. In short, the quadripartita ratio offered the student or author a ready-made framework, whether for changing words or the transformation of entire texts. Since it concerned relatively mechanical procedures of adaptation that for the most part could be learned, the techniques concerned could be taught at school at a relatively early age, for example in the improvement of pupils’ own writing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of rhetoric was taken by [[Erasmus]] in ''[[De Copia Rerum]]''.&lt;ref name="Jansen"/&gt;

== Mimesis ==
Dionysius' concept marked a significant depart from the concept of ''[[mimesis]]'' formulated by [[Aristotle]] in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors."&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; In [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[lyric poetry]], [[epic poetry]], drama, dancing, painting are all described as forms of [[mimesis]].

'''''Doctor Who: DWO WhoCast''''' (commonly known as '''''The Whocast''''', but officially titled '''''Doctor Who Podcast: DWO WhoCast''''') is a weekly [[podcast]] which discusses the British [[science fiction]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. This podcast is notable because it is the most popular Doctor Who Podcast worldwide as shown within the independent [[iTunes]].&lt;ref&gt;iTunes Store when searching for both ''Doctor Who'' and ''Doctor Who Podcast''&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=dependent on editors competence not a reliable source|date=February 2015}} The podcast is produced by ''[[Doctor Who Online]]'' which is a ''[[Doctor Who]]'' fan website based in the United Kingdom by Sebastian J. Brook and Paul A.T. Wilson.

==History==
''The Whocast'' was started in April 2006, during the original run of Series 2 of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', by Paul A.T. Wilson in conjunction with a ''Doctor Who'' meeting group based in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewhocast.com/DWOWhocast/archive.asp?MonthYearID=200604 Doctor Who Online – DWO WhoCast] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016220144/http://www.thewhocast.com/DWOWhocast/archive.asp?MonthYearID=200604 |date=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the early episodes could be considered somewhat derivative of both [[Podcast Who]] and [[Podshock]] it soon established its own style, with very much a British slant. Also due to its location, the Podcast was able to start featuring interviews with actors and production staff from both the current and classic series.

In September 2006, ''The Whocast'' teamed up with ''Doctor Who Online'', with a significant format change and the addition of a co-host, Sebastian J. Brook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewhocast.com/DWOWhocast/archive.asp?MonthYearID=200609 Doctor Who Online – DWO WhoCast] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016220214/http://www.thewhocast.com/DWOWhocast/archive.asp?MonthYearID=200609 |date=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the format change, the podcast attracted more listeners and experienced a dramatic growth in listenership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewhocast.com/reports |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814132835/http://www.thewhocast.com/reports/ |archivedate=2007-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, ''The DWO Whocast: DWO TorchCast'' was rated 4/5 by ''SciFiNow Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;Issue 2 of SciFi Now Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, ''The DWO Whocast'' was rated 5/5 by ''SciFiNow Magazine'' and podcast was featured and referred to as "Must hear now".&lt;ref&gt;Issue 9 of SciFi Now Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, ''The DWO Whocast: Sarah Jane Adventures Mini-Cast'' was rated 4/5 by ''SciFiNow Magazine'', the podcast was featured and referred to as "Must hear now".&lt;ref&gt;Issue 10 of SciFi Now Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

In Episode #66, which was released on 21 April 2008, Paul and Seb hosted their last DWO WhoCast, stating that time was one of the reasons behind the recent drought in WhoCast episodes. Their successors as of Episode #67 were Trevor Gensch (from the MMM Commentaries and Fantragic podcasts) and Tony Gallichan. The handover was smooth with a touching signoff from Paul and Seb 'walking off into the sunset' as the new presenters introduce themselves. Paul and Seb have since stated they are working even closer together as they redesign the main Doctor Who Online website.

In June 2008, ''The DWO Whocast'' was rated 4/5 by ''SFX Magazine'' (Issue #171).&lt;ref&gt;Issue 171 of SFX Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;
In Episode #99, it was announced that Tony would not be continuing with the WhoCast.

In Episode #101, Marty Perrett joined the show as the new permanent co-host. James Rockliffe also joined the team and provides occasional pre-recorded review segments such as Big Finish audio reviews. He co-hosts the show with Trevor and Marty on occasion.

In Episode #159, Marty Perrett announced his departure from the program. Chip from the Two Minute Time Lord podcast will host with Trevor for the short term.

In Episode #167, Tom Attah joined the DWO WhoCast team. Tom provides occasional pre-recorded review segments such as Big Finish audio reviews.

In Episode #177, Trevor Gensch, James Rockclife and Tom Attah announced their departure from the show. They started up their own podcast called The Doctor Who Podcast. The outgoing team indicated the DWO WhoCast will continue with new hosts.

From April 2, The Whocast refreshed and brought back the original hosts Paul AT Wilson and Sebastian J. Brook. Also the numbering of the episodes were refreshed to 5.1. to fit in with the 2010 Doctor Who Series. The podcast has been on indefinite hiatus since episode 5.11 was released in late May.

In Late January 2011, The Doctor Who Online website announced via Twitter that The DWO WhoCast would return shortly. On Friday 11 February, the show returned, together with a new logo and a new host, Cameron K. McEwan, as well as a return for veteran DWO WhoCast host, Tony Gallichan. The show continued its previous numbering system with Episode #178.

==Current podcast format==
During the airing season of ''Doctor Who'' and when major releases happen, the WhoCast features reviews and commentary. Most reviews are discussion based, with the co-hosts giving their views and sometimes having listener participation.

The podcast usually features interviews with people involved with the new and the old series of ''Doctor Who'' and [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]. Interviews with members of the cast and crew from the classic and the new series of ''Doctor Who'' are common; the team are regularly joined by not only minor cast members but actors who have played the Doctor, such as [[Colin Baker]] and [[Peter Davison]]. They have had members of the effects team such as [[Neill Gorton]] and [[Mat Irvine]] as well as other members of production staff.

Alongside their guests, they are well known for holding competitions, ranging from signed autobiographies, scripts from [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] to tours of the Millennium FX Studios.

This is why other people can tickle us (no efference copies of the movements that touch us) but we cannot [[tickle]] ourselves (efference copies tell us that we are stimulating ourselves).]]

An '''efference copy''' or '''efferent copy''' is an internal copy of an outflowing (''[[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent]]''), movement-producing signal generated by the [[motor system]].&lt;ref name="Jeannerod83"&gt;Jeannerod, Marc (2003): "Action Monitoring and Forward Control of Movements". In: Michael Arbib (Ed.), ''The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks.'' Second Edition. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, pp. 83–85, here: p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be collated with the (reafferent) sensory input that results from the agent's movement, enabling a comparison of actual movement with desired movement, and a shielding of perception from particular self-induced effects on the sensory input to achieve perceptual stability.&lt;ref name="Jeannerod83" /&gt; Together with [[internal model (motor control)|internal models]], efference copies can serve to enable the brain to predict the effects of an action.&lt;ref name="Jeannerod83" /&gt;

An equal term with a different history is ''corollary discharge''.&lt;ref&gt;Gyr, John W. (1972): Is a Theory of Direct Visual Perception Adequate? ''Psychological Bulletin'', 77(4), Apr 1972, 246–261, {{doi|10.1037/h0032352}}, here: p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Efference copies are important in enabling motor adaptation such as to enhance gaze stability. They have a role in the perception of self and nonself [[electric fields]] in [[electric fish]]. They also underlie the phenomenon of [[tickling]].

==Motor control==

===Motor signals===
A motor signal from the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) to the periphery is called an ''efference'', and a copy of this signal is called an efference copy. Sensory information coming from [[sensory receptors]] in the [[peripheral nervous system]] to the central nervous system is called ''afference''. On a similar basis, nerves into the nervous system are [[afferent nerve]]s and ones out are termed [[efferent nerve]]s.

When an efferent signal is produced and sent to the [[motor system]], it has been suggested that a copy of the signal, known as an efference copy, is created so that exafference (sensory signals generated from external stimuli in the environment) can be distinguished from reafference (sensory signals resulting from an animal's own actions).&lt;ref name="Gallistel"&gt;{{cite book |last= Gallistel |first= CR |title=The Organization of Action: A New Synthesis |publisher= Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year= 1980 |location= Hillsdale |pages= 166–209|isbn=0-470-26912-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Efference Copy.png|thumb|500x500px|An efference copy is used to generate the predicted sensory input which estimates the (somato)sensory consequences of a motor command (top row). The sensory consequences of the executed motor command (bottom row) are used to compare with the corollary discharge to inform the CNS about external actions.]]

This efference copy, by providing the input to a forward [[internal model (motor control)|internal model]], is then used to generate the predicted sensory feedback that estimates the sensory consequences of a motor command. The actual sensory consequences of the motor command are then deployed to compare with the corollary discharge to inform the CNS about how well the expected action matched its actual external action.&lt;ref name="Wolpert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolpert |first=DM |author2=Miall RC |year= 1996 | title=Forward Models for Physiological Motor Control |journal= Neural Networks |volume= 9| pages= 1265–1279|doi=10.1016/S0893-6080(96)00035-4|pmid=12662535|issue=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corollary discharge===
Corollary discharge is characterized as an efference copy of an action command used to inhibit any response to the self generated sensory signal which would interfere with the execution of the motor task. The inhibitory commands originate at the same time as the motor command and target the sensory pathway that would report any reafference to higher levels of the CNS. This is unique from the efference copy, since the corollary discharge is actually fed into the sensory pathway to cancel out the reafferent signals generated by the movement.&lt;ref name="Gallistel"/&gt; Alternatively, corollary discharges briefly alters self-generated sensory responses to reduce self-induced desensitization or help distinguish between self-generated and externally generated sensory information.&lt;ref name="Poulet"&gt;{{cite journal| last= Poulet| first= JFA |author2=Hedwig B|year= 2006 |title=New insights into corollary discharges mediated by identified neural pathways | journal= Trends in Neurosciences |volume= 30| pages=14–21 | doi= 10.1016/j.tins.2006.11.005| pmid= 17137642| issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Steinbuch===
"In 1811 Johann Georg Steinbuch (1770–1818) referred repeatedly to the problem of efference copy and reafference in his book "Beytrag zur Physiologie der Sinne" ("Contribution to the Physiology of Senses"). After studying medicine, Steinbuch worked for a number of years as lecturer at the University of Erlangen and thereafter as physician in Heidenheim, Ulm, and Herrenberg (Württemberg, South Germany). As a young university teacher, he was particularly interested in the brain mechanisms which enable the perception of space and objects, but in later years his attention shifted to the more practical problems of clinical medicine. Together with Justinus Kerner he gave a very precise description in 1817 of the clinical symptoms of botulism. In his book "Beytrag zur Physiologie der Sinne”, Steinbuch presented a very careful analysis of the tactile recognition of objects by the grasping hand. Hereby, he developed the hypothesis that the cerebral mechanisms controlling the movement of the hands interact within the brain with the afferent signal flow evoked in the mechanoreceptors while the grasping hand is moving across the surface of the object. The cerebral signals controlling the movement were called "Bewegidee" (motion idea). According to Steinbuch’s model, only by the interaction of the "Bewegidee" with the afferent signal flow did object recognition become possible. He illustrated his statements by a simple experiment: if an object passively activates the mechanoreceptors of the palm and fingers of a resting hand for sufficient sequences and time, object recognition is not achieved. When the hand, however, grasps actively, object recognition occurs within a few seconds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link= :de:Otto-Joachim Grüsser |first= Otto-Joachim |last= Grüsser |chapter= On the History of the Ideas of Efference Copy and Reafference |title= Essays in the History of Physiological Sciences: Proceedings of a Symposium Held at the University Louis Pasteur Strasbourg, on March 26-27th, 1993 |editor-first= Claude |editor-last= Debru |date= 1995 |pages= 35–56  |volume= 33 |series= The Wellcome Institute Series in the History of Medicine: Clio Medica |isbn= 978-9051836462 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===von Helmholtz===
The first person to propose the existence of efferent copies was the German physician and physicist [[helmholtz|Hermann von Helmholtz]] in the middle of the 19th century. He argued that the brain needed to create an efference copy for the motor commands that controlled [[eye muscle]]s so as to aid the brain's determining the location of an object relative to the head.  His argument used the experiment in which one gently presses on one's own eye. If this is done, one notices that the visual world seems to have "moved" as a result of this passive movement of the [[human eyeball|eyeball]]. In contrast, if the eyeball is actively moved by the eye muscles the world is perceived as still. The reasoning made is that with a passive movement of the eyeball, no efferent copies are made as with active movements that allow sensory changes to be anticipated and controlled for with the result in their absence the world appears to move.

===Sherrington===
In 1900, [[Charles Scott Sherrington|Charles Sherrington]], the founder of modern ideas about motor control, rejected von Helmholtz ideas and argued that efference copies were not needed as muscles had their own sense of the movements they made. 
"The view [of von Helmholtz and his followers] which dispenses with peripheral organs and afferent nerves for the muscular sense has had powerful adherents . . . It supposes that during ... a willed movement the outgoing current of impulses from brain to muscle is accompanied by a 'sensation for innervation'. ... it "remains unproven".&lt;ref&gt;Sherrington CS. (1900). The muscular sense. In Textbook of Physiology, ed. E. A. Schafer, vol 2 pp. 1002-25. Edinburgh/London Pentland&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the idea of efference copies being dropped for the next 75 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Matthews | first1 = P. B. C. | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ne.05.030182.001201 | title = Where Does Sherrington's "Muscular Sense" Originate? Muscles, Joints, Corollary Discharges? | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 5 | pages = 189–218 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6462096 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Von Holst===
In 1950, [[Erich von Holst]] and Horst [[Horst Mittelstaedt|Mittelstaedt]] investigated how species are able to distinguish between exafference and reafference given a seemingly identical percept of the two.&lt;ref&gt;von Holst E., Mittelstaedt H. (1950). The reafference principle. Interaction between the central nervous system and the periphery. In Selected Papers of Erich von Holst: The Behavioural Physiology of Animals and Man, London: Methuen. (From German) 1 : 1 39-73.&lt;/ref&gt; To explore this question, they rotated the head of a fly 180 degrees, effectively reversing the right and left edges of the retina and reversing the subject's subsequent reafferent signals. In this state, self-initiated movements of the fly would result in a perception that the world was also moving, rather than standing still as they would in a normal fly. After rotation of the eyes, the animal showed a reinforcement of the optokinetic response in the same direction as the moving visual input. Von Holst and Mittelstaedt interpreted their findings as evidence that corollary discharge (i.e. neural inhibition with active movement) could not have accounted for this observed change as this would have been expected to inhibit the optokinetic reaction. They concluded that an "Efferenzkopie" of the motor command was responsible for this reaction due to the persistence of the reafferent signal and given the consequent discrepancy between expected and actual sensory signals which reinforced the response rather than preventing it.&lt;ref name="Gallistel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Von Holst | first1 = E. | title = Relations between the central Nervous System and the peripheral organs | doi = 10.1016/S0950-5601(54)80044-X | journal = The British Journal of Animal Behaviour | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 89–94| year = 1954 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sperry===
The Nobel Prize winner, [[Roger Wolcott Sperry]] argued for the basis of corollary discharges following his research upon the [[optokinetic reflex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sperry | first1 = R. W. | title = Neural basis of the spontaneous optokinetic response produced by visual inversion | journal = Journal of comparative and physiological psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 482–489 | year = 1950 | pmid = 14794830 | doi=10.1037/h0055479}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also regarded as the originator of the term "corollary discharge".&lt;ref name="Jeannerod83" /&gt;

==Motor adaptation==

===The Coriolis effect===
Efference copy relates to [[Coriolis effect]] in a manner that allows for learning and correction of errors experienced from self-generated Coriolis forces. During trunk rotational movements there is a learned CNS anticipation of Coriolis effects, mediated by generation of an appropriate efference copy that can be compared to re-afferent information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohn |first= JV|author2=DiZio P |author3=Lackner JR |date=1 June 2000|title=Reaching during virtual rotation: context specific compensations for expected coriolis forces.|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|volume=83|pages=3230–3240 |url=http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/83/6/3230 | format=pdf |issue=6|accessdate= 24 June 2008 |pmid=10848543}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Pigeon|first= P|author2=Bortolami SB |author3=DiZio P |author4=Lackner JR |year=2003|title=Coordinated turn and reach movements.

===Gaze stability===
It has been proposed that efference copy has an important role in maintaining gaze stability with active head movement by augmenting the [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]] (aVOR) during dynamic visual acuity testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Herdman|first=SJ |author2=Schubert MC |author3=Tusa RJ  |year= 2001|title=Role of Central Preprogramming in Dynamic Visual Acuity With Vestibular Loss |journal=Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg|volume=127|pages=1205–1210 |url=http://archotol.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/127/10/1205| format=pdf|accessdate= 24 June 2008|pmid= 11587600|issue= 10 |doi=10.1001/archotol.127.10.1205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grip force===
Efference copy within an internal model allows us to grip objects in parallel to a given load. In other words, the subject is able to properly grip any load that they are provided because the internal model provides such a good prediction of the object without any delay. Flanagan and Wing tested to see whether an internal model is used to predict movement-dependent loads by observing grip force changes with known loads during arm movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flanagan |first=R |author2=Wing AM|date=15 February 1997|title=The role of internal models in motion planning and control: evidence from grip force adjustments during movements of hand-held loads |journal= Journal of Neuroscience|volume=17 |pages=1519–1528| url= http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/17/4/1519 |format=pdf |issue=4|accessdate= 24 June 2008 |pmid=9006993}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that even when giving subjects different known loads the grip force was able to predict the load force. Even when the load force was suddenly changed the grip force never lagged in the phase relationship with the load force, therefore affirming the fact that there was an internal model in the CNS that was allowing for the proper prediction to occur. It has been suggested by Kawato that for gripping, the CNS uses a combination of the inverse and forward model.&lt;ref name="Kawato"&gt;{{cite journal| last= Kawato| first=K |year=1999 |title=Internal models for motor control and trajectory planning |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=9 |pages=718–727 |doi= 10.1016/S0959-4388(99)00028-8| pmid= 10607637| issue= 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the use of the efference copy the internal model can predict a future hand trajectory, thus allowing for the parallel grip to the particular load of the known object.

==Tickling==
Experiments have been conducted wherein subjects' feet are tickled both by themselves and with a robotic arm controlled by their own arm movements. These experiments have shown that people find a self-produced tickling motion of the foot to be much less ''“tickly”'' than a tickling motion produced by an outside source. They have postulated that this is because when a person sends a motor command to produce the tickling motion, the efference copy anticipates and cancels out the sensory outcome. This idea is further supported by evidence that a delay between the self-produced tickling motor command and the actual execution of this movement (mediated by a robotic arm) causes an increase in the perceived tickliness of the sensation. This shows that when the efference copy is incompatible with the afference, the sensory information is perceived as if it were exafference. Therefore, it is theorized that it is not possible to tickle ourselves because when the predicted sensory feedback (efference copy) matches the actual sensory feedback, the actual feedback will be attenuated. If the predicted sensory feedback does not match the actual sensory feedback, whether caused by a delay (as in the mediation by the robotic arm) or by external influences from the environment, the brain cannot predict the tickling motion on the body and a more intense tickling sensation is perceived. This is the reason why one cannot tickle oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Blakemore |first=Sarah-Jayne |author2=Wolpert, Daniel |author3=Frith, Chris  |date=August 2000 |title=Why can't you tickle yourself? |journal=NeuroReport |volume=11 |issue=11 |url=http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/Public/Wolpert/Publications/BlaWolFri00.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-03 |format=pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage''''' is an [[Action game|action]] [[Racing video game|racing]] game, the third in the ''[[FlatOut]]'' demolition racing series, known earlier as ''FlatOut: Total Carnage''. ''FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage'' was announced February 1, 2007, and was released on July 22, 2007 in Europe, on August 1, 2007 in Australia, and on October 2, 2007 in North America for the [[Xbox 360]]. The game is an [[Video game remake|enhanced port]] of ''[[FlatOut 2]]'' featuring new gameplay modes and graphics as well as at least two new cars.

A demo for the [[Xbox 360]] version was released on [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] on July 19, 2007. The [[Microsoft Windows]] version was released through the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] network on August 26, 2008, and in stores on September 2. There is also a handheld version of the game for the [[PlayStation Portable]] called '''''FlatOut: Head On''''', which was released in Australia on March 12, 2008, in Europe two days later, and in North America on April 4, 2008.&lt;ref name=PSP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/psp/942912-flatout-head-on/data |title=FlatOut: Head-On Release Information for PSP |publisher=[[GameFAQs]] |accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Ultimate Carnage'' introduces a brand new series of tracks which are based anywhere from busy streets to storm water drains.

The cars are more detailed than previous games in the series, employing the latest in dynamic lighting and shadow technology, and a greatly enhanced damage and physics engine where each car is made of up to 40 separate destructible parts. The single player game supports up to 11 other AI-controlled cars in each race.

A new multiplayer format is also included; this runs on the [[Games for Windows - Live]] system which requires you to either sign into your Xbox LIVE or Games for Windows LIVE Gamertag, or sign up for one for free. The LAN function is not available in ''FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage'', unlike the previous two ''FlatOut'' games for Windows.

'''''Forum''''' is one of the oldest weekly political magazines in the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. It has been in publication since 1997.

== Background ==
In 2007, ''Forum'' joined the Seavus Group.  Even though, Forum is recognized as political magazine, but still, other fields like economy, culture, and life, cover significant part of the magazine pages. The world stories are also fully covered by the correspondents in Moscow and Washington, and the busy stringers in the neighboring countries. To keep the pace with global trends, ''Forum'' added two new media -a portal and English-language monthly magazine ''Free Time Guide Macedonia''.

The portal offers the same quality of contents as the magazine, with persistent rise in visits thanks to freshness, stridency and originality. It follows global standards and highest trends. ''Free Time Guide Macedonia'' is a monthly magazine in English, focusing on Macedonia's fortune, its beauties, traditions and people. Its utmost objective is to present the beauties of Macedonia and to show the cheerfulness of its soul, and also to offer something new and extraordinary to every foreigner in the Republic of Macedonia. Forum seized to exist in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dzunica.mk/ Слобода на медиуми] Retrieved 6. May 2018 (Macedonian)&lt;/ref&gt;

HTV3 always has the copyright from the creator and production of all the shows broadcast. It is broadcast 24 hours a day on VTC, K+, AVG television services in Vietnam.

==History==
HTV3 channel was set up in 2004 by [[Ho Chi Minh City Television]] with blocks for children. In 2008, the channel was sold to Tri Viet Media Corporation (TVM Corp.). At the end of 2014, TVM was sold to TTN Media and HTV3 became the TTN Media's channel. HTV3 had a private voice actor group for themselves to dub foreign shows (anime, cartoon, television series, movie and other entertainment shows). In 2010, HTV3 had about sixty-three voice actors (including [[Huyền Chi]], [[Anh Tuấn]] and [[Trường Tân]]). In 2014, many staff members left HTV3 before the channel was sold to TTN Media. As of now, the channel only has about twenty voice actors and a few other staff members. In April 2017, TTN Media was renamed to Purpose Media. In July 1, 2017, HTV3 launched HTV3 - Dreams TV

'''Keith A. Parkinson''' (October 22, 1958 – October 26, 2005) was an American [[fantasy art]]ist and [[illustrator]] known for book covers and artwork for games such as ''[[EverQuest]]'', ''[[Guardians (card game)|Guardians]]'', ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', and ''[[Vanguard: Saga of Heroes]]''. After designing book and magazine covers for [[TSR (company)|TSR]], Parkinson moved into game design in the 1990s, and co-designed the [[collectible card game]] ''Guardians''. Parkinson died of [[leukemia]] in 2005,  just four days after his 47th birthday.

==Early life==
Keith Parkinson was born in [[West Covina, California]]. Because of his father's career at [[Ally Financial|GMAC]], Parkinson spent his childhood in various cities in the United States including [[San Diego, CA]], [[New York City|New York, NY]], [[Miami, Florida]], and [[Lansing, Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Dragon #113"&gt;{{cite journal

For several years, my band toured on weekends. We were into [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and played stuff by [[Blue Öyster Cult]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Led Zeppelin]], and other heavy metal monster groups."&lt;ref name="Dragon #113"/&gt; At one gig, Parkinson met his future wife, Mary, who later became the ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' Magazine Advertising Coordinator.&lt;ref name="Dragon #113"/&gt;

==Career==

===Art and illustration===
Parkinson graduated from [[Kendall College of Art and Design]] in 1980. His first job was with a company called Advertising Posters, where he worked on the artwork for [[pinball]] games and early [[arcade game]]s, including ''[[Tron (arcade game)|Tron]]'' and ''[[Krull (video game)|Krull]]''.&lt;ref name="Dragon #113" /&gt; Parkinson was heavily influenced by [[Frank Frazetta]] and [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]] in his own fantasy work.&lt;ref name="Dragon #113"/&gt; At Advertising Posters, Parkinson was introduced to ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' by a coworker. Parkinson recalls, "The first night I played a [[Ranger (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|ranger]] in B1, ''[[The Keep on the Borderlands|Keep on the Borderlands]]'', and I was hooked. We played every week."&lt;ref name="Dragon #113"/&gt;

In November 1982, he went to work at [[TSR, Inc.]]: "I didn’t like a lot of the art I saw on ''D&amp;D'' game products, and the company was in [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]], just over the border, so I drove up one day to see if I could do some freelance work. [[Larry Elmore|Elmore]], [[Jeff Easley]], and [[Timothy Truman (writer)|Tim Truman]] had all just joined the company, and the art they were working on was fantastic. It really blew my mind. [[Jim Roslof]], who was the Art Director, hinted that I could join the staff full-time, but I missed the hint. A few days later, I called him about a job, and he had just hired somebody else the day before, but he'd keep me in mind. The next day, he called back, and had an opening.”&lt;ref name="Dragon #113"/&gt; Parkinson also worked on projects including book covers, game boxes, magazines and calendars.&lt;ref name="kpbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keithparkinson.com/bio.php |title=Keith Parkinson's biography|accessdate=8 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516071201/http://www.keithparkinson.com/bio.php |archivedate=16 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his book covers are such titles as ''[[Star Frontiers]]'', ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' and ''[[Gamma World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackgate.com/2011/02/02/art-evolution-20-keith-parkinson-1958-2005/ |title=Art Evolution 20: Keith Parkinson [1958-2005] |accessdate=2013-08-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117091607/https://www.blackgate.com/2011/02/02/art-evolution-20-keith-parkinson-1958-2005/ |archivedate=2016-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for his [[Dragonlance]] art.

After five years working at TSR, Parkinson left and pursued a freelance career for seven years. During this time, most of Parkinson's work was painting covers for the New York publishing market. His clients included [[Bantam Books]], [[Palladium Books]], [[Penguin Books]], and [[Random House]]. Some of the authors that he painted covers for include [[Terry Goodkind]], [[Margaret Weis]], [[Tracy Hickman]], and [[Terry Brooks]].&lt;ref name="kpbio"/&gt;

===Game design and books===
In 1995, Parkinson's first attempt at game design, ''[[Guardians (card game)|Guardians]]'', was published by Friedlander Publishing Group (FPG),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingreport.com/article.php?sid=19122 |title=Artist Keith Parkinson Passes|author=Damon White|publisher=[[GamingReport.com]] |date=28 October 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018213306/http://www.gamingreport.com/article.php?sid=19122|archivedate=October 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also published Parkinson's first book, titled ''Knightsbridge: The Art of Keith Parkinson''. He published two more books of his artwork: a sketchbook, ''Spellbound'', and a second full-color artbook, ''King's Gate''. Other works from this time include a set of art [[trading cards]] and a screensaver produced by [[Second Nature Software]].

In 2000, Parkinson devoted more of his time to writing and shifted his commercial art to the game industry. He produced art for [[THQ]]'s ''[[Summoner (video game)|Summoner]]'' and painted the well-known artwork for the original ''[[EverQuest]]'' as well as its first three expansion packs. In painting the box art, he also created the character Firiona Vie, who has adorned the cover of almost every expansion since.

Parkinson was hired as the art director and co-founder of [[Sigil Games Online]],{{when|date=July 2014}} and worked there on the [[MMORPG]] ''[[Vanguard: Saga of Heroes]]'' until his death in late 2005.  Although Parkinson became ill before he could create the box art for ''Vanguard: Saga of Heroes'', he did create the game's three 'mascot' characters: Jeric, Eila, and Idara. According to Brad McQuaid, when Parkinson knew he could not finish the box art for ''Vanguard'', he hoped that his friend [[Donato Giancola]] would complete it. The left side of Donato's painting emulated Parkinson's personal style, as a tribute to him (the left was used for the box art, similar to ''EverQuest''). Moving to the right, the painting transitions into Giancola's style. As a further tribute to Keith Parkinson, Giancola put a character resembling him into the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silkyvenom.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3722 |title=Vanguard Box Art Revealed|date=11 May 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220851/http://www.silkyvenom.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3722|archivedate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesafehouse.org/mugshots/e32006may10/IMG_2543 Vanguard: Saga of Heroes]. Retrieved 13 August 2006{{Dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
After a long battle with [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] (AML), Keith Parkinson died on 26 October 2005.&lt;ref name="kpbio"/&gt; He is survived by his wife, Donna, and sons Nick and Zach. Parkinson was described by his friends and colleagues (and in the eulogy by [[Brad McQuaid]]) as having had a true passion for his work, as well as having a friendly and positive demeanor until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradmcquaid.com/ParkinsonEulogy.htm |title=Keith Parkinson Eulogy|author=Brad McQuaid |date=October 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505144150/http://www.bradmcquaid.com/ParkinsonEulogy.htm|archivedate=May 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small graveside funeral was held at [[Mission San Luis Rey de Francia]] led by Vicar David Smith of Faith Lutheran Church in [[Vista, California]].

==Awards, honors, and tributes==
In 2002, Parkinson was nominated for a [[Chesley Awards|Chesley Award]] from the [[Association of Science Fiction and Fantasy Artists|ASFA]], for Best Product Illustration, for his work on ''Shadows of Luclin''.&lt;ref&gt;(October 2002). "Newsnotes: Award nominations", ''[[DNA Publications|Chronicle]]'' '''24''' (10): 6–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, an art expo, called "The Masters of Fantasy Art — A Tribute to Keith Parkinson" went on tour from February–July 2007. Laura Naviaux, Senior Brand Manager for [[Sony Online Entertainment]], explained: "Our goal for 'The Masters of Fantasy Art' tour is to highlight the artistry that is integral to the creation of video games, as well as the influences of classical art on the industry as a whole. By showcasing Keith Parkinson's work on the new ''Vanguard: Saga of Heroes'' online videogame and joining up with The Art Institute, we hope to raise the public's awareness of computer and graphical arts as a discipline."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keithparkinson.com/artshowpr.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212081138/http://www.keithparkinson.com/artshowpr.php |archivedate=February 12, 2007 |title=THE MASTERS OF FANTASY ART - A TRIBUTE TO KEITH PARKINSON |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August and September 2008, Parkinson's alma mater Kendall College of Art and Design at Ferris State University, honored him and his TSR contemporaries [[Larry Elmore]] and [[Jeff Easley]] with a gallery exhibit called "Out of the Dungeons". Director of Exhibitions Sarah Joseph stated, "We wanted to honor Parkinson [...] It seemed fitting to include Elmore and Easley, since all three of them worked together for a number of years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2008/08/grand_rapids_science_fiction.html|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120904152046/http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2008/08/grand_rapids_science_fiction.html|archivedate=4 September 2012|title=Fantasy artists are focus of show}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Landesfunkhaus Niedersachsen''''' ([[Lower Saxony]] state broadcast station) is a group of buildings of the public broadcaster [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] in Hanover, the state capital of Lower Saxony. The broadcaster is based in Hamburg, but has facilities in the capitals of other states that it serves. The ''Funkhaus'' is located on the [[Maschsee]] at the {{ill|Rudolf-von-Bennigsen-Ufer|de}}. When it was built from 1949 to 1952, it was known as the '''''Funkhaus Hannover''''' (Broadcast station Hannover). It includes two halls for public concerts, ''Großer Sendesaal'' (1963) and ''Kleiner Sendesaal'', also administrative buildings and an [[antenna tower]].&lt;ref name="Knocke" /&gt;

== History ==
The history of broadcasting in Hanover dates back to 1924 when the first radio programs were aired from a factory building of the engineering firm [[Hanomag]].&lt;ref name="Knocke" /&gt; After World War II that building was in the British zone. A new office (''Rundfunkbüro'') was opened in the {{ill|Anzeiger-Hochhaus|de}} in 1945, and first concerts were aired from buildings of the ''Pädagogische Hochschule'' ([[School of education]]).&lt;ref name="Thielen" /&gt; Regular broadcasting, now by the [[Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk]] (NWDR) began in 1948, including symphony concerts and the series ''Funkbilder aus Niedersachsen'' (radio images from Lower Saxony), which began with the second [[Hannover Messe|Export-Messe]].&lt;ref name="Thielen" /&gt;

Plans for a new Funkhaus began end of 1948. {{ill|Rudolf Hillebrecht|de}}, responsible for municipal building, voted for the location, to set an example for buildings along the lake. After a competition, designs by {{ill|Friedrich Wilhelm Kraemer|de}}, [[Gerd Lichtenhahn]] and [[Dieter Oesterlen]] were combined.&lt;ref name="Knocke" /&gt; The first buildings were completed in 1950, and inaugurated on 20 January 1951.&lt;ref name="Thielen" /&gt; Due to the advanced technical equipment of the complex, it was immediately called the most modern Funkhaus in Europe.&lt;ref name="Fotoarchiv" /&gt; In 1955 the NWDR was split in the NDR in Hamburg and the [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]] (WDR) in Cologne. A redaction team of the NDR was installed in the Funkhaus in 1958.&lt;ref name="Thielen" /&gt;

Oesterlen designed the concert hall ''Großer Sendesaal'' which was built from 1960 to 1963.&lt;ref name="Knocke" /&gt; From 1 January 1981, the complex was called ''Landesfunkhaus Niedersachsen''.&lt;ref name="Thielen" /&gt; In 1989 it became a registered monument of the ''[[Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz|Denkmalschutz]]''.&lt;ref name="Fotoarchiv"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9965">{{For|the Insane Clown Posse recording|Leck mich im Arsch (Insane Clown Posse song)}}
"'''{{Lang|de|Leck mich im Arsch|italic=no}}'''" (literally "Lick me in the arse") is a [[Canon (music)|canon]] in [[B-flat major]] composed by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Köchel catalogue|K.]]&amp;nbsp;231 (K.&amp;nbsp;382c), with lyrics in German. It was one of a set of at least six canons probably written in [[Vienna]] in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cliff Eisen]], ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' online, {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sung by six voices as a three-part [[round (music)|round]], it is thought to be a party piece for his friends.  The main theme is derived from the final movement of [[Joseph Haydn]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 3]] in G-Major.

==English translation==
"Lick me in the [[wikt:arse|arse]]" is a [[calque]] of the song's title and lyrics into English. A more [[idiom]]atic translation would be the English "Kiss my arse!" or American "Kiss my ass!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schemann | first = Hans | title = English-German Dictionary of Idioms | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-415-17254-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication and modern discovery==
Mozart died in 1791 and his widow, [[Constanze Mozart]], sent the manuscripts of the canons to publishers [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] in 1799 saying that they would need to be adapted for publication. The publisher changed the title and lyrics of this canon to the more acceptable "{{Lang|de|Laßt froh uns sein|italic=no}}" ("Let us be glad!"). Of Mozart's original text, only the first words were documented in the catalogue of his works produced by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel.&lt;ref name="NMA"&gt;[http://dme.mozarteum.at/DME/nma/nma_cont.php?vsep=93&amp;gen=edition&amp;l=1&amp;p1=-20 Preface to the ''Neue Mozart Ausgabe''] Vol. III/10, p. X.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new text version, which may have been the authentic one, came to light in 1991. Handwritten texts to this and several other similar canons were found added to a printed score of the work in an historical printed edition acquired by [[Harvard University]]'s Music Library. They had evidently been added to the book by a later hand. However, since in six of the pieces these entries matched texts that had, in the meantime, independently come to light in original manuscripts, it was hypothesised that the remaining three may, too, have been original, including texts for K.&amp;nbsp;231 ("Leck mich im Arsch" itself), and another Mozart work, "[[Leck mir den Arsch fein recht schön sauber]]" ("Lick my arse nice and clean", K.&amp;nbsp;233; K.&amp;nbsp;382d in the revised numbering).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Allan|last=Kozinn|authorlink=Allan Kozinn|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6DD1F31F931A35750C0A967958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fM%2fMozart%2c%20Wolfgang%20Amadeus|title=Three Naughty Mozart Texts Are Found|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 March 1991|accessdate=19 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later research revealed that the latter work was likely composed by [[Wenzel Trnka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plath|first1=Wolfgang|authorlink1=Wolfgang Plath|author2=Bennwitz, Hanspeter|author3=Buschmeier, Gabriele|author4=Feder, Georg|author5=[[Klaus Hofmann|Hofmann, Klaus]]|title=Opera incerta.

==Lyrics==
The text rediscovered in 1991 consists only of the repeated phrases:&lt;ref&gt;Denis Pajot: "K.&amp;nbsp;233 and K.&amp;nbsp;234 Mozart's 'Kiss my Ass' Canons." [http://www.mozartforum.com/Lore/article.php?id=070 Mozart Forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208200135/http://www.mozartforum.com/Lore/article.php?id=070 |date=2009-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;{{Lang|de|Leck mich im A… g'schwindi, g'schwindi!
Leck im A... mich g'schwindi.
Leck mich, leck mich,

etc. etc. etc.|italic=no}}&lt;/poem&gt;
where "A..." obviously stands for "Arsch"; "g'schwindi" is a dialect word meaning "quickly".&lt;ref&gt;"G'schwindi" does not appear in dictionaries of Standard German; it appears to be widespread in regional dialects; see [https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=+g%27schwindi#hl=en&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=g%27schwindi+dialekt].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerized]] text of the early printed editions reads:
{|
|&lt;poem&gt;{{Lang|de|Laßt uns froh sein!
Murren ist vergebens!
Knurren, Brummen ist vergebens,
ist das wahre Kreuz des Lebens,
das Brummen ist vergebens,

|&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;Let us be glad!
Grumbling is in vain!
Growling, droning is in vain,
is the true bane of life,
Droning is in vain,
Growling, droning is in vain, in vain!
Thus let us be cheerful and merry, be glad!&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

Another semi-bowdlerized adaptation is found in the recordings of ''The Complete Mozart'' edition by [[Brilliant Classics]]:&lt;ref name="brill"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://music.brilliantclassics.com/epages/joan.storefront/46e7959800359f06271dd5d385f406d2/Product/View/92540|title=Mozart Edition, Complete Works|accessdate=12 September 2007|publisher=Foreignmediagroup.com|year=2006|author=Brilliant Classics|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921173618/http://music.brilliantclassics.com/epages/joan.storefront/46e7959800359f06271dd5d385f406d2/Product/View/92540|archivedate=21 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.integralemozart.info/telechargements/V8_Mozart.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mozart Complete Edition (Brilliant), Volume 8: CD 1, Canons |accessdate=12 September 2007 |publisher=Integrale Mozart |year=2007 |language=German, Italian |author=integralemozart.info |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219104835/http://www.integralemozart.info/telechargements/V8_Mozart.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a clear allusion to the line "{{Lang|de|... er kann mich im Arsche lecken!|italic=no}}" attributed to the late medieval German knight [[Götz von Berlichingen (Goethe)#Famous quote|Götz von Berlichingen]], known best as the title hero of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s [[Götz von Berlichingen (Goethe)|drama]].

'''Meteodyn WT''', commonly known as '''Meteodyn''' is a [[wind energy software]] program that uses [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) to conduct [[wind resource assessment]]. Developed and marketed by Meteodyn, Meteodyn WT was first released in September 2009. The software quantifies the wind resource in a desired terrain in order to assess the feasibility of a proposed [[wind farm]]. The software’s objective is to design the most profitable [[wind farm]]. This is achieved by taking into account the measured wind data at a [[measurement tower]] and the terrain conditions. Both of these are essential to be able to obtain the wind conditions and therefore the wind resources of the desired terrain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://meteodyn.com/en/logiciels/cfd-wind-farm-resource-software-meteodynwt/#.Wruydy5ubX4|title=Meteodyn WT software - Wind resource assessment software|work=Meteodyn|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.environmental-expert.com/software/meteodyn-wt-cfd-software-for-wind-resource-assessment-116427|title=Meteodyn WT - CFD Software for Wind Resource Assessment by Meteodyn {{!}} Environmental XPRT|website=www.environmental-expert.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/MeteoDyn_FAQ|title=MeteoDyn FAQ -- CFD-Wiki, the free CFD reference|website=www.cfd-online.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meteodyn WT has been validated with actual wind measurements by independent studies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pereira|first=R|last2=Guedes|first2=Ricardo|last3=Silva Santos|first3=Carlos|date=2010-01-01|title=Comparing WAsP and CFD wind resource estimates for the "regular" user|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266067580_Comparing_WAsP_and_CFD_wind_resource_estimates_for_the_regular_user}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Díaz|first=Carlos|last2=Mancebo|first2=Asensio|last3=Uzunoglu|first3=Bahri|date=2014-03-10|title=COMPARISON STUDY FOR TWO COMMERCIAL WIND RESOURCE ANALYSIS CFD SOFTWARE FOR AN EMBANKMENT|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280080646_COMPARISON_STUDY_FOR_TWO_COMMERCIAL_WIND_RESOURCE_ANALYSIS_CFD_SOFTWARE_FOR_AN_EMBANKMENT|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.3249.7129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meteodyn WT is used by [[wind turbine]] manufacturers, wind farm developers, [[Consulting firm|consulting firms]] and wind farm operators.

{{Culture of Finland}}
{{Music of Finland}}

The '''music of Finland''' can be roughly divided into the categories of folk music, classical and contemporary art music, and contemporary popular music.

The folk music of [[Finland]] is typically influenced by [[Karelia]]n traditional tunes and lyrics of the ''[[Kalevala]]'' metre. Karelian heritage has traditionally been perceived as the purest expression of [[Finnic peoples|Finnic]] myths and beliefs, thought to be spared from [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] influences. In the west of the country, more mainstream [[Traditional Nordic dance music|Nordic folk music]] traditions prevail. The [[Sami people]] of northern Finland have their own musical traditions, collectively [[Sami music]]. Finnish folk music has undergone a [[roots revival]] in the recent decades, and has also become a part of popular music.

In the field of classical and contemporary art music, Finland has produced a proportionally exceptional number of musicians and composers.

Contemporary popular music includes a renowned [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] scene like other Nordic countries, as well as a number of prominent rock and pop bands, jazz musicians, [[hip hop]] performers and makers of [[dance music]]. There is also a [[Schlager]] scene with bandstand dancing where the local variety of [[Tango music|tango]] is also popular.

==Folk music==
There are two major traditions of folk music in Finland, namely, music of the ''Kalevala form,'' and ''[[Traditional Nordic dance music|Nordic folk music]]'' or ''pelimanni music'' ([[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] ''spelman'', "player of music").  The former is considered the older one. Its most important form is called  ''runonlaulanta'' ("poem singing", or chanting) which is traditionally performed in a [[Trochaic tetrameter|trochaic tetrametre]] using only the first five notes on a scale. Making use of [[alliteration]], this type of singing was used to tell stories about heroes like [[Väinämöinen]], [[Lemminkäinen]], and [[Kullervo]]. The songs were memorised, not written down, and performed by a soloist, or by a soloist and a chorus in [[antiphony]] (see: ''[[Kalevala]]''). The [[Vantaa Chamber Choir]] is an example of a choir that sings such poems in modern arrangements.
[[file:RAI-OdeonA228021_02.ogg|left|thumb| Suomen laulu sung by a choir in 1929.]]
''Pelimanni'' music is the Finnish version of the [[Nordic folk dance music]], and it is [[tonality|tonal]]. It came to Finland from [[Central Europe]] via [[Scandinavia]], starting in the 17th century, and in the 19th century, it replaced the Kalevalaic tradition. ''Pelimanni'' music was generally played on the [[fiddle]] and [[clarinet]]. Later, the [[Pump organ|harmonium]] and various types of [[accordion]]s were also used. Common dances in the ''pelimanni'' traditions include: [[polka]], [[mazurka]], [[schottische]], [[quadrille]], [[waltz]], and [[minuet]].

A form of rhyming sleighride singing called ''[[rekilaulu]]'' also became popular in the 17th century. Despite opposition from most of the churches in Finland, ''rekilaulu'' remained popular and is today a common element in pop songs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Since the 1920s, several popular Finnish performers have used ''rekilaulu'' as an integral part of their repertoire. Early pioneers in this field of pop rekilaulu included [[Arthur Kylander]], while Erkki Rankaviita, [[Kuunkuiskaajat]], and Pinnin Pojat have kept the tradition alive.

Early in the 20th century, the region of [[Kaustinen]] became a center of innovation for ''pelimanni'' music. Friiti Ojala and Antti Järvelä were fiddlers of the period. [[Konsta Jylhä]] and the other members of Purpuripelimannit (formed in 1946) became perhaps the most influential group of this classical period. Well-known Finnish folk music groups of today in the Kaustinen tradition include [[JPP]], [[Frigg (band)|Frigg]] (although part Norwegian), and Troka. A group more focused on the earlier ''Kalevala'' singing traditions and the ''[[kantele]]'' is [[Värttinä]]. Another important folk musician of today is the [[accordion]]ist [[Maria Kalaniemi]].
[[file:HMVX3127_01.mp3.ogg|right|thumb|Sikerma Laulaunaytelmasta performed in 1929.]]
Common instruments today also include [[trumpet]]s, [[French horn|horn]]s and [[whistle]]. Important musical virtuosos are Leena Joutsenlahti, Teppo Repo and Virpi Forsberg. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} More traditional Finnish instruments include the ''kantele'', which is a [[chordophone]], and was used in the ''Kalevala'' by the hero [[Väinämöinen]]. More primitive instruments like the ''[[jouhikko]]'' (a [[Bow (music)|bowed]] [[lyre]]) and the ''[[säkkipilli]]'' (Finnish [[bagpipe]]) had fallen into disuse, but are now finding new popularity in a folk revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Dawn K. | last=Shanks | url=http://cultureweek.com/?p=288 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708213007/http://cultureweek.com/?p=288 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=8 July 2011 | title=Start with Finnish | work=Culture Week | date=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, influences from modern music and dances such as [[jazz]] and [[Foxtrot (dance)|foxtrot]] led to distinctively Finnish forms of dance music, such as ''[[humppa]]'' and ''[[jenkka]]''.

=== Sami music ===
{{Main|Sami music}}

The [[Sami people|Sami]] of northern Finland, [[Sweden]], and [[Norway]] are known for highly spiritual songs called ''[[joik]]'', reminiscent of a few types of [[Native American music|Native American]] singing. The same word sometimes refers to ''lavlu'' or ''vuelie'' songs, though this is technically incorrect. The [[hip hop]] artist [[amoc (rapper)|Amoc]] is noted for rapping in [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]], a Sami language from the area of [[Inari, Finland|Inari]].

== Classical and art music ==

=== Classical music ===
[[File:Vårt land - front page.jpg|thumb|right|Vårt land (Maamme), the national anthem of Finland, from 1863]]
In the 18th century, public concerts were established in [[Turku]] and [[Erik Tulindberg]] wrote six very famous string quartets. After [[Russia]]'s 1809 annexation of Finland, the cities of [[Viipuri]] and [[Helsinki]] became cultural centers and [[opera]] became very popular. The first Finnish opera was written by the [[Germany|German]] composer [[Fredrik Pacius]] in 1852. Pacius also wrote [[Maamme|''Maamme/Vårt land'' (Our Land)]], Finland's [[national anthem]] and founded [[Akademen|Akademiska Sångföreningen]] in year 1838, the oldest still active choir in Finland.

In 1874, the [[Society for Culture and Education]] ''(Kansanvalistusseura)'' was founded in order to provide opportunities for artistic expression, beginning with the [[Jyväskylä]] festival in 1881. The festival, organized on [[Estonia]]n roots, still exists today. In 1883, the [[Helsinki University Chorus]] ''(Ylioppilaskunnan Laulajat)'' was founded as one of the few Finnish-language choirs in the mostly [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yl.fi/choir.php The Choir – YL Male Voice Choir&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608203211/http://www.yl.fi/choir.php |date=8 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year conductor [[Robert Kajanus]] founded what is known as the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]] and [[Martin Wegelius]] founded what is now known as the [[Sibelius Academy]].

In the 1890s, Finnish [[nationalism]] based on the ''Kalevala'' spread, and [[Jean Sibelius]] became famous for his vocal symphony [[Kullervo (Sibelius)|Kullervo]]. He soon received a grant to study poetry singers in Karelia and continued his rise as the first prominent Finnish musician. In 1899 he composed [[Finlandia (symphonic poem)|Finlandia]], which played its important role in Finland gaining independence. He remains one of Finland's most popular national figures and is a symbol of the nation.

Alongside Sibelius, the national romanticism sprouted a number of composers who all contributed in the formation of a distinct Finnish style of music. [[Heino Kaski]] was a composer of small chamber music pieces, [[Erkki Melartin]]'s vast output includes six symphonies, [[Yrjö Kilpinen]] composed a vast number of solo songs, as well as [[Leevi Madetoja]], [[Toivo Kuula]]. The 1930s saw composers like [[Uuno Klami]] and Yrjö Kilpinen rise to popularity. Kilpinen's approach was somewhat nationalistic, whereas Klami had Karelian influences while also leaning towards French models.

Finland has a very lively classical music scene. Composers are accompanied by a large number of great conductors such as [[Mikko Franck]], [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]] (also a notable composer), [[Jukka-Pekka Saraste]], [[Osmo Vänskä]], [[Susanna Mälkki]], [[Leif Segerstam]] and [[Sakari Oramo]] [[OBE]]. Many Finnish singers and instrumentalists have also achieved international success. Among them are the opera singers [[Martti Talvela]], [[Karita Mattila]], [[Matti Salminen]], [[Soile Isokoski]] and [[Topi Lehtipuu]], the pianists [[Ralf Gothoni]], [[Olli Mustonen]] and [[Paavali Jumppanen]], as well as the clarinettist [[Kari Kriikku]] and the violinist [[Pekka Kuusisto]]. Practically all prominent Finnish musicians perform both classical and contemporary art music, the old and new music are not separated from each other.

The opening of the new [[Finnish National Opera]] in 1993 and the new [[Helsinki Music Centre|Helsingin Musiikkitalo]] in 2011 strengthened the position of classical and art music in the national infrastructure. The orchestra network in Finland might be proportionally the densest in the world, with the 30 member orchestras of the Association of Finnish Symphony Orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071106160433/http://sinfoniaorkesterit.fi/en/index.php?trg=memberlist]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opera ===
[[Aino Ackté]] and other prominent opera singers founded the [[Finnish Opera]] in 1911. Ackté also began a festival in [[Savonlinna]] the following year; this was the precursor of the [[Savonlinna Opera Festival]], which was started in the 1960s, shortly before the new Finnish opera became famous in the 1970s. Leevi Madetoja's 1924 ''[[Pohjalaisia]]'', an operatic [[allegory]] about [[Russia]]n oppression during the previous decades, became popular during the 1920s. At roughly the same time, [[Aarre Merikanto]] composed the opera ''[[Juha (Merikanto)|Juha]]'' to the libretto by Aino Ackté, who rejected it and asked Leevi Madetoja to compose another version instead; Merikanto's Juha was first performed after the composers death in 1958, and is nowadays widely regarded as an underrated masterwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/28/arts/music-nurturing-operatic-talent-with-a-kind-of-tough-love.html|title=MUSIC; Nurturing Operatic Talent With a Kind Of Tough Love|first=Cori|last=Ellison|date=28 July 2002|accessdate=15 December 2017|website=Nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aulis Sallinen]] started a new wave of Finnish opera in the 1970s with ''[[The Horseman (opera)|The Horseman]]'' and ''[[The Red Line]]''. The Red Line was soon recognized all over the globe with numerous reproductions in a.o. [[Moscow]], [[London]] and [[New York City]]. Along with Sallinen's stage works, [[Joonas Kokkonen]]'s opera [[The Last Temptations]] contributed heavily to the new rise of the Finnish opera music. More recent major operas by Finnish composers include among others [[Kaija Saariaho]]'s ''L'Amour de loin'' and ''Adriana mater'' as well as [[Olli Kortekangas]]'s ''Isän tyttö'' ("Daddy's Girl").

===Contemporary art music===
The first wave of post-classical music in Finland came about in the 1920s with young modernists Aarre Merikanto, [[Väinö Raitio]] and [[Sulho Ranta]]. However, this movement was tamed by the growing nationalistic tendency in the arts before the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130211173820/http://www.fimic.fi/fimic/fimic.nsf/0/D4AA477A4DC1CA2DC225753C004EDB09?opendocument]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s, [[Erik Bergman]] and Joonas Kokkonen gained popularity and added important technical innovations to Finnish music. A new generation of Finnish composers turned into modernism, like [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]] and [[Usko Meriläinen]], while the [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] style had its voice in the music of [[Einar Englund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zyUOv6EQrWcC&amp;pg=PA144|title=New Music of the Nordic Countries|first=Jean|last=Christensen|date=15 December 2017|publisher=Pendragon Press|accessdate=15 December 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950s saw an increase in international attention on Finnish music and soon helped modernize Finnish composing.

The forming of the ''Ears Open!'' society in 1977&lt;ref name="fimic.fi"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130211173814/http://www.fimic.fi/fimic/fimic.nsf/0/0C726B3A536967C5C2257611002BF9D5?opendocument&amp;cat=contemporary_classical]&lt;/ref&gt; turned out to be the major change in the Finnish art music. From its circles there emerged a few composers and musicians who achieved worldwide success, like the conductor-composer Esa-Pekka Salonen, and the composers [[Eero Hämeenniemi]], [[Kaija Saariaho]], [[Magnus Lindberg]] and [[Jouni Kaipainen]].&lt;ref name="fimic.fi"/&gt; The early ''Ears Open!'' society followed keenly the [[Central Europe]]an modernism along the lines of [[Pierre Boulez]] and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], but also showed a lot of interest towards the post-war [[Polish School (music)|Polish School]] composers like [[Witold Lutoslawski]]. ''Ears Open!'' was followed by the forming of [[Avanti! Chamber Orchestra]] in 1983, which offered a fine platform for composers and instrumentalists to introduce new works and stylistic flows in Finland.

In the 21st century, the modernist movement has waned somewhat, but is still represented by composers like [[Veli-Matti Puumala]] and [[Lotta Wennäkoski]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130211201657/http://www.fimic.fi/fimic/puumala+veli-matti]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091012031441/http://www.fimic.fi/fimic/fimic.nsf/0/FA8C267E59B1BBD9C22574C80026E6C6?opendocument]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juhani Nuorvala]] is a rare [[Minimal music|minimalist]], whereas [[Osmo Tapio Räihälä]] and [[Sebastian Fagerlund]] are leaning more towards [[Postmodern music|post-modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fennicagehrman.fi/composers/nuorvala-juhani/|title=Nuorvala, Juhani (*1961): Fennica Gehrman - Finnish sheet music|website=Fennicagehrman.fi|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130211195632/http://renewmusic.org/composers/r%C3%A4ih%C3%A4l%C3%A4-osmo-tapio]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even performing of contemporary art music blossoms in Finland, with specialized groups like [[Uusinta Chamber Ensemble]] and [[Zagros Ensemble|Zagros]]. The most important stages for contemporary art music are the established festivals [[Time of Music]] in [[Viitasaari]], [[Musica nova Helsinki]] and [[Tampere Biennale]], as well as the [[Klang Concert Series]] in Helsinki.

==Popular music==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}

=== Iskelmä ===
Iskelmä (coined directly from the German word ''[[Schlager]]'', meaning ''hit'') is a traditional Finnish word for a light popular song. [[Georg Malmstén]] started his career in the 1930s. After [[World War II]] and pre-rock music era, such names as [[Olavi Virta]] or [[Tapio Rautavaara]], for example, were among the most popular male singing stars in Finland, and [[Toivo Kärki]] and [[Reino Helismaa]] most popular songwriters. Such foreign musical genres as [[Tango music|tango]] would find their domestic audience as their Finnish appropriations. [[Laila Kinnunen]], [[Carola Standertskjöld|Carola]], [[Annikki Tähti]], [[Brita Koivunen]] and [[Vieno Kekkonen]] were some of the most acclaimed Finnish chanteuses of this time period. From the late 1960s, [[Irwin Goodman]] ({{a.k.a.}} Antti Hammarberg), combining ''iskelmä'' and [[protest songs]], would gain popularity with the humorous tunes penned by [[Vexi Salmi]], who would become one of the most laborious writer of lyrics also for other Finnish artists. [[Juha Vainio|Juha "Watt" Vainio]] was another popular songwriter, known not only for Finnish renditions of many international hits but also for his own songs and being a performer in his own right. In the 1970s, hugely successful "Finnhits" compilation records of various artists would continue in the ''iskelmä'' tradition. Also rural-flavoured ''[[humppa]]'' would prove to be a successful variation of ''iskelmä'', later on parodied by the band [[Eläkeläiset]]. Other popular Finnish ''iskelmä'' singers are among all [[Katri Helena]], Danny (a.k.a. [[Ilkka Lipsanen]]), [[Fredi (singer)|Fredi]], [[Eino Grön]], [[Erkki Junkkarinen]], [[Frederik (singer)|Frederik]] (a.k.a. Ilkka Sysimetsä), [[Marion Rung]], [[Tapani Kansa]], [[Kirka]] (a.k.a. Kirill Babitzin), [[Matti &amp; Teppo]], [[Jari Sillanpää]], and [[Kikka Sirén]]. The annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]] has been avidly followed in Finland and eagerly participated by the singers voted to the contest by national juries, and were finally successful in 2006 with the melodic heavy rock band [[Lordi]].

Like Finnish music in general, ''iskelmä'' is written mostly in minor, although to this rule there are many exceptions. The melodies have a distinguishable Finnish "flavour" that is somewhat related to Russian and Italian melodies and harmonies although Scandinavian and Anglo-American influence can also be heard.

''Iskelmä'' music is mostly and essentially dance music, and it is mostly if not solely performed on dancing stages and halls spread around the country. The best known and perhaps most beloved and respected though not most performed or danced genre of dances is the [[tango (ballroom)|tango]]. A clear indication of this is, that the annual Finnish contest for iskelmä artists is named as "[[Tangomarkkinat]]" meaning "The Tango Marketplace"; many of the superstars of contemporary iskelmä have won this competition and it is major spectacle in Finland, even to some extent comparable with the [[San Remo festival]] in Italy.

Iskelmä is typically non-urban music and its greatest popularity is situated to the countryside and smaller cities.

Traditionally has [[accordion]] been the major instrument in iskelmä music and it is still played, but has in most cases been replaced by  [[guitar]], [[electric piano]] and [[synthesizer]]. These, with drums, electric bass and occasional use of saxophone form the basic instrumentation of iskelmä.

=== Rock music ===
Rock arrived in Finland in the 1950s. Founded in the 1960s, [[Love Records]] was one of the first domestic record labels dedicated to [[Finnish rock|Finnish rock music]], even though the label's roster also included jazz and political songs. During the late 1960s, [[Blues Section]], a group inspired by [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[The Who]] gained the reputation of being "the first Finnish band of international quality". Another band that gained some reputation was [[Apollo (Finnish band)|Apollo]] that had the later great jazz-drummer [[Edward Vesala]] as a band member. During these early days of Finnish rock the music didn't have much typical Finnish "flavour" and in the case of most bands, the activity was restricted in performing music made by international superstars. The aforementioned [[Blues Section]] later developed into internationally acknowledged "superband" Wigwam, had an English singer [[Jim Pembroke]], who also wrote the lyrics and many of the melodies/harmonies of their songs. In the early days of the band there however were also songs with Finnish lyrics written by [[Jukka Gustafsson]] such as the classical [[Luulosairas]].

During the 1970s, progressive rock groups [[Wigwam (progressive rock)|Wigwam]] and [[Tasavallan Presidentti]] received critical acclaim in the United Kingdom, but fame evaded them. [[Pekka Streng]] was one of the great early pioneers of Finnish rock music with his very personal progressive folkrock and Finnish lyrics with a spiritual content. In the 2000s, there was a Streng-renaissance and one of his songs even became an international club hit. A hard-rock group called [[Hurriganes]] was popular in [[Sweden]] as well as in Finland, but not further afield. [[Hector (musician)|Hector]], [[Juice Leskinen]], [[Dave Lindholm]] and many other successful artists of the 1970s sang their lyrics in Finnish, a trend that has continued to this day.  During the 1970s the genre of "[[suomirock]]" were born through the pioneering work of artists such as mentioned above.

[[Suomirock]] is a word that literally means Finnish rock music. However, its true meaning is a more specific one, meaning rock/pop music with Finnish lyrics. As a genre and a name it really started its life in the 1980s following the punk movement. It means rock/pop music, that is not only imitating international trends or otherwise having international sound and English lyrics, but a form of rock-music, that is recognizably Finnish and have Finnish lyrics. A more and more general and recent term is "suomipop". The boundaries between what is considered "rock" and "pop" have become quite blurred and arbitrary, and largely dependent upon personal preference. As it is also to some extent with rock / pop and iskelmä. Traditionally in [[iskelmä-music]] the artists themselves with few exceptions did not write their songs or lyrics, but in the rock scene the [[singer/songwriter]] aspect of the artist was considered important.  It still is, but in the 2000s it is more and more typical that new performers such as ''[[Idols (Finland)|Idols]]'' songcontest winner [[Ari Koivunen]] perform even heavy rock in the manner, that used to be typical only in iskelmä-scene.

The [[punk rock|punk]] movement arrived in Finland in 1977 and had a great influence on the Finnish youth culture, [[Pelle Miljoona]] being the most famous Finnish punk singer. [[Terveet Kädet]] also started the hardcore punk-wave in Finland. Another popular band, [[Eppu Normaali]], also started during this time period, (later to change its style from punk to rock / pop). At the same time, Finland also had a massive Ted movement of [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and [[rockabilly]] fans, later parodied by Finnish [[lo-fi]] punk band [[Liimanarina]].

In the 1980s, most favoured artists were punkish [[Dingo (band)|Dingo]] and heavy-hearted [[Yö]], both singing their lyrics in Finnish. In the underground, [[Ismo Alanko]], considered by many as the foremost Finnish rock lyricist, gained a legendary status with his punkish groups [[Hassisen Kone]] and [[Sielun Veljet]]. [[Kauko Röyhkä]] was another literate underground icon, leaning musically towards [[Velvet Underground]]. The 1980s showed short international fame for [[Punk rock|punk]] style [[glam rock]] band [[Hanoi Rocks]]. Hanoi Rocks have been cited as an influence by major bands such as Guns N' Roses. Smack and Peer Günt were other successful Finnish bands of same style. Heavy metal was very popular in Finland during the 1980s, producing groups like [[Stone (band)|Stone]], the latter being a fondly remembered speed metal act. [[Hardcore punk]] is also popular in Finland, including bands such as [[Endstand]], [[Abduktio (band)|Abduktio]], [[I Walk the Line (band)|I Walk the Line]], and [[Lighthouse Project]].

In the early 1990s Finnish rock parody group the [[Leningrad Cowboys]], a re-grouped international rock comedy band that grew out of the Finnish comedy band [[Sleepy Sleepers]], whose members were used as actors in [[Aki Kaurismäki]]'s comedy film ''[[Leningrad Cowboys Go America]]'', achieved Central European touring success and performed live at the [[MTV Music Awards]] in New York City in 1994, together with the full [[Alexandrov Ensemble|Red Army Choir]], performing "[[Sweet Home Alabama]]". This was the biggest TV audience of any Finnish music artist ever. Leningrad Cowboys were famous for outrageous outfits including ridiculous rock-a-billy hairdos and ultra-pointed shoes. The band was not able to develop that visibility into more U.S. success but remained popular in parts of Europe.

Though Finnish bands tend to write their lyrics in English as to leave their music open to countries outside of native Finnish boundaries, in the 1990s bands such as [[Apulanta]], [[Miljoonasade]], [[Ultra Bra]] and the shamanic art-punk group [[CMX (band)|CMX]] had found their share of success with Finnish lyrics. The hard-to-define electronic country garage rock group [[22 Pistepirkko]] got excellent reviews in the Finnish rock press and has reached some kind of a cult status in Central Europe. Some other notable Finnish cult rock groups of this era are the psychedelic, [[Hendrixian]] [[Kingston Wall]] that went in their late period far into [[psychedelia]] taking influence from [[shamanism]] and some of some genres of [[electronic dance music]], and equally psychedelic but gothic, gloomy, and heavy [[Mana Mana]].

A band to enjoy recent commercial success is [[The Rasmus]]. After eleven years together and several domestic releases, the band finally captured Europe. Their ''[[Dead Letters]]'' album sold 1.5 million units worldwide and garnered them eight gold and five platinum album designations. The single "[[In the Shadows (song)|In the Shadows]]" placed on Top 10 charts in eleven countries and was the most played video on [[MTV Europe]] for 2005. The Helsinki natives released their follow up album, ''[[Hide From The Sun]]'', domestically in 2005. The album has a U.S. release date of 10.10.2006. To promote the album's U.S. release, the band has toured with the Welsh band [[Lostprophets]], a band that has gained a great deal of success in both Europe and the United States. The new album ''[[Black Roses (The Rasmus album)|Black Roses]]'' is set to be released on September. The album was produced by [[Desmond Child]] and the first single is called ''[[Livin' in a World Without You]]''. This album was released worldwide on September 29. The single livin in a world without you was released on 10 September 2008.

===Heavy metal===

Finland is known for its many [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] acts, including many from the [[death metal]], [[black metal]], [[doom metal]], [[folk metal]], [[power metal]], and [[symphonic metal]] subgenres.

Finland host a doom metal scene more focused on the depressive mood of the genre, evoking an intense grieving feeling.&lt;ref name="Grief"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metalstorm.net/pub/interview.php?interview_id=137 |title=Swallow The Sun interview (10/2005) |work=[[Metal Storm]] |author=DerRozzengarten |accessdate= January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bands play with very slow tempos and melodic tones, creating an atmosphere of darkness and melancholia.&lt;ref name="Grief" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://themoscownews.com/arts/20110324/188521655.html |title=Russian doom, Finnish-style |work=The Moscow News |author=Vladimir Kozlov |accessdate=January 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110202504/http://themoscownews.com/arts/20110324/188521655.html |archivedate=January 10, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This scene was kick-started by the band [[Spiritus Mortis|Rigor Mortis]] (which, due to an older US band with the same name, changed their name to Spiritus Mortis), which originated in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/finland/alavus/spiritus+mortis |title=SPIRITUS MORTIS |work=MusicMight |author=DerRozzengarten |accessdate= January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mortis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.femforgacs.hu/interju/473/Spiritus_Mortis_interview |title=Spiritus Mortis interview |work=Fémforgács |accessdate= January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable bands include [[Reverend Bizarre]],&lt;ref name="RevBiz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/toppicks/tp/bestfinnishmetalbands.htm |title=Best Finnish Heavy Metal Bands |work=About.com |author=Marsicano, Dan |accessdate= January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minotauri]],&lt;ref name="Mortis" /&gt; [[Dolorian]],&lt;ref name="Grief" /&gt; [[Shape of Despair]],&lt;ref name="Grief" /&gt; [[Thergothon]],&lt;ref name="Grief" /&gt; [[Skepticism (band)|Skepticism]]&lt;ref name="Grief" /&gt; and [[Unholy (band)|Unholy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peaceville.com/news/?date=2011-08 |title=The Second Ring of Power – CD&amp;DVD edition coming in October |work=[[Peaceville Records]]'s Official site |accessdate= January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later 1990s the [[symphonic metal]] group [[Apocalyptica]] played [[Metallica]] cover songs as cello quartettos and sold half a million records worldwide. The recently retired [[Timo Rautiainen &amp; Trio Niskalaukaus]] were one of Finland's most popular metal acts in the early 2000s, having risen from the ashes of late 1980s – early 1990s cult band [[Lyijykomppania]]. Children's power metal band [[Hevisaurus]] have also become popular, mostly in their native country.

Several Finnish metal bands have attained considerable worldwide success within the underground metal scene. Some remarkable examples of such bands are [[Stratovarius]] and [[Sonata Arctica]], highly renowned as one of the top power metal bands of the world, and  [[Children of Bodom]], with their creative combination of power metal and melodic death metal.

[[Nightwish]] is considered a pioneer of symphonic metal that incorporates power metal as well as gothic metal in its music and had [[Tarja Turunen]], a classical singing soprano, as its vocalist until 2005. The band has received platinum and gold certifications for its albums sales in many countries and is the third best selling Finnish artist. The band has also been nominated for several awards and amongst the ones it has won 11 [[Emma-gala awards]], the Echo award, the Mtv Europe music award, the World music award and the Metal Storm award. In 2000 the band participated in the Finnish qualification for the [[Eurovision]] song contest and ended in the second place.

[[Kotiteollisuus]] is undoubtedly one of the most popular bands in Finland, having produced one platinum and several gold-selling albums and winning Emma-awards in 2003 and 2005 for best metal record (Helvetistä itään) and best DVD (Kotiteollisuus DVD) respectively.

Most recently, the Finnish hard rock band [[Lordi]] won the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest with a record 292 points, giving Finland its first ever victory. The song they used was "[[Hard Rock Hallelujah]]" and they celebrated this with a free concert in Market Square in Helsinki, Finland, on 26 May 2006.

[[File:HIM-milano1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]] in 2005]]

From the beginning of 2000, [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]] reached greater sales and more international success than any other band to ever come from Finland. Going gold with their first official American release Dark Light. Several Finnish bands have followed the lead of that band. [[Entwine]], [[Lullacry]], and [[Poisonblack]] are just a few Finnish bands of these genres.

=== Hip-hop ===

Finland also has its share of hip-hop bands as during the late 1990s to early 2000s, the Finnish hip-hop scene has gained strength. Dating back from growing underground culture one of the first Finnish Hip Hop records with lyrics in English was recorded at Vernissa (C) Manus / (P) Johanna Kustannus 1991 by [[Damn The Band]]. Later Finland has [[Nuera]] with MC's Skem (Henry Kaprali) &amp; Dream (Petri Laurila) from Tampere region. Nueras first release is dated to 1992. Same guys, together with DJ K2 were also behind a hip-hop based radio show on YleX. The first popular hip-hop band to break the taboo of making rap lyrics in Finnish (rapping in Finnish was not regarded as serious business because the first artists to do this in the early 1990s such as [[Raptori]], [[Nikke T]] and  [[Pääkköset]] were humorous project and were popular mostly among children) was [[Fintelligens]] arguably one of the most successful hip hop bands in Finland.  Let's not forget about Ceebrolistics, their first cassette single ''Sping'' was released in 1995 their lyrics has been both in Finnish and English. Few other important very popular but underground acts were [[MC Taakibörsta]], [[Notkea Rotta]] and [[Paleface (Finnish musician)|Paleface]] just to mention a few from the same era.

Today rap music is one of the major genres of Finnish pop-music and there are many artists, who have reached wide popularity. Still it can be said, that rap-scene is primarily an underground-movement. But even independent artists such as ASA with often very political and critical lyrics are quite popular. ASA's "leijonaa mä metsästän"-album was the third on Finnish albumchart in 2005. Finnish rap-artists, such as [[Paleface (Finnish musician)|Paleface]] with English lyrics have not attained international success. An exception to this is /breakbeat-/electro-/ hiphop-band  [[Bomfunk MC's]], who with their MC [[Raymond Ebanks]] became popular in [[Central Europe]], as they had the most sold European hit single of 2000, "[[Freestyler (song)|Freestyler]]" along with [[trance music]] act [[Darude]]'s international hit "[[Sandstorm (Darude composition)|Sandstorm]]".

=== Pop music ===

In the 1990s, a popular new trend was so-called [[Eurodance]] music and this style also had Finnish followers, many of which however are today quite forgotten. A couple of bands also wrote their lyrics in English, but didn't make it on the international music market. To mention few artists, there were [[Hausmylly]], [[Aikakone]] and [[Movetron]].

Some contemporary Pop/Rock singers, such as [[Maija Vilkkumaa]], [[Sanni Kurkisuo]], [[Jenni Vartiainen]], [[Anssi Kela]], [[Irina Saari|Irina]], [[Chisu]], [[Anna Puu]], [[Anna Eriksson]], [[Hanna Pakarinen]] and [[Antti Tuisku]], and pop rock groups such as [[Scandinavian Music Group]], [[Poets of the Fall]] and [[PMMP]], are very popular in Finland and they all primarily sing in Finnish, which may contribute to their relatively low profile internationally.

Since the late 1990s and early 2000s, female artists have taken a more visible role in the Finnish pop music scene, not only as performers, but also songwriters. A talented singer-songwriter [[Chisu]] writing Finnish lyrics for instance is a good example of this phenomenon with a couple of her songs, that can very well be considered classics beside the songs of [[Eppu Normaali]], [[Tuomari Nurmio]] and others in the future.

A number of iskelmä, rock- and popsongs have attained a status of a classic, the standard for the status being, that many have had some connection with the song and it is not a "hit of today". Although the differences between "pop", "rock" and "iskelmä" are remarkable in social signification – stereotypically "iskelmä" being music for people of greater age and countryside, "rock" and "pop" that of youth and people living in cities – the boundaries between the popular music "genres" are in reality rather vague. This seems to be true especially in a small number of popular songs that are performed over and over again in original form, or rearranged into new musical idioms and dialects.

=== Contemporary folk music ===
In the 2000s, an underground-movement of new Finnish folk music came out. Artists such as [[Joose Keskitalo]], [[Mika Rättö|Kuusumun Profeetta]], [[Paavoharju]] and others have brought something new into the Finnish music scene although wider popularity has not reached them. Despite their lyrics written in Finnish these bands have also attained international recognition, even cult-following. Also very well known artists with a status of a "classic", [[J. Karjalainen]] and [[Pauli Hanhiniemi]] have in their contemporary production gone to the direction of folk-music although this music has in spite of being recognized by critics, been left unnoticed by the larger public.

Another new phenomenon of 2000s, beside that of the very popular rap- and the underground folk-scenes, is "[[suomireggae]]". With their Finnish lyrics with moral and spiritual content these artists such as [[Soul-Captain Band]], [[Kapteeni Ä-ni]], [[Jukka Poika]] and [[Raappana (musician)|Raappana]] have also reached not just a cult following but also wider popularity.

The underground scenes of various genres are very lively in Finland at the moment and a lot of bands and artists defy the genre-limits. A good example is very popular Finnish underground rap artist ASA (formerly known as [[MC Avain]]), who has used folk-artists as the accompanying band. Of bands such as [[Profeetta ja UMU]] it is very hard to say, what genre they represent.

=== Electronic music ===

In the field of electronic music, [[Jori Hulkkonen]], as well as [[Jimi Tenor]] and [[Pan Sonic]], have had underground success worldwide for a decade. In the sphere of trance Finland has given birth to internationally renowned DJs such as [[DJ Orkidea]], Alex Kunnari, [[DJ Proteus]], [[JS16]], [[Super8 &amp; Tab]] and [[Paavo Siljamäki]]. Other notable Finnish artists are Mesak, [[Imatran Voima (band)|Imatran Voima]], [[Mr Velcro Fastener]], EODEM, [[Luomo]] a.k.a. [[Vladislav Delay]], [[Brothomstates]], [[Lackluster]], [[Pan Sonic]], [[Op:l Bastards]] and [[Ovuca]]. Some of the best-known electronic music labels are among all [[Sähkö Recordings]], [[Kahvi Records]], [[Dum Records]] (run by [[Kimmo Rapatti]] a.k.a. [[Mono Junk]]) and [[Jyväskylä]]'s [[Rikos Records]]. The indisputable pioneer of Finnish [[electronic music]] is [[Erkki Kurenniemi]] who built his legendary DIMI synthesizers in the late 1960s and early 1970s. There's also the Finnish underground [[psy trance]] culture, which is mostly active in the Helsinki metropolitan area. The Finnish style ([[suomisaundi]]) of psy trance music is known worldwide and has notable fan audiences abroad, for example in [[Japan]] and [[Russia]]. Main characters in Finnish psy trance are artists such as [[Mullet Mohawk]], Texas Faggott and [[Squaremeat]]. By far the most popular Finnish electronica artist is [[Darude]] (Ville Virtanen), who gained international success with his chart-topping single "Sandstorm," and the following hit album "Before the Storm." His music is a combination of hard house and progressive trance. The Finnish [[Hard Dance]] scene has also gained some following, primarily due to Helsinki-based [[DJ Proteus]] winning the title of Best DJ at The Hard Dance Awards in 2004 and 2005. Finland also has a popular and internationally recognised Freeform hardcore scene, with the FINRG label enjoying large success in the UK, Australia, and more recently Canada and the United States.

In experimental electronica, noise and ambient electronic music, Finland is represented by artists like Petri Kuljuntausta, Pink Twins, Ihokas, Rihmasto, Nemesis, Niko Skorpio, Dystopia, Ozone Player, Winterplanet, Corporate 09, Outer Space Alliance.

=== Jazz ===

[[Jazz]] came to [[Finland]] in connection with the visit of American immigrants in 1926. One of the very first Finnish jazz bands was [[Dallapé]] which is still active to this day. Klaus Salmi, [[Eugen Malmstén]], [[:fi:Erik Lindström|Erik Lindström]], [[Toivo Kärki]], [[:fi:Ossi Aalto|Ossi Aalto]] and Kauko Viitamäki are some of the first professional [[Finnish jazz musicians]]. Jazz bands were mainly doing dance gigs so the music had to be suitable for dancing. Popular genres were accordion jazz, [[ragtime]], [[Swing (jazz performance style)|swing]], jazz [[Schlager music|schlager]] and [[Waltz (music)|waltz]].

The first decades of Finnish jazz music were strongly based on imitating foreign role models until the 1960s when a new generation of jazz musicians started to create more original music by combining American tradition and Finnish folk music influences. This group of talented and well trained musicians included [[:fi:Esa Pethman|Esa Pethman]], [[Heikki Sarmanto]], [[Eero Koivistoinen]] and [[Henrik Otto Donner]]. [[Edward Vesala]]'s and [[:fi:Paroni Paakkunainen|Paroni Paakkunainen]]'s [[:fi:Soulset|Soulset]] band managed to succeed in international contests and festivals. The first Finnish jazz festival, [[Pori Jazz]], was organized for the first time in 1966.

In the 1970s, Finnish jazz musicians began to mix jazz, [[funk]] and [[progressive rock]] in their music. [[Pekka Pöyry]], [[Sakari Kukko]], [[Pekka Pohjola]], [[Jukka Tolonen]] and [[Olli Ahvenlahti]] were some of the most famous Finnish jazz musicians in the 1970s. Sakari Kukko's [[:fi:Piirpauke|Piirpauke]] played jazz music which was heavily influenced by Finnish folk music and progressive rock. The music of [[Wigwam (Finnish band)|Wigwam]] and [[Tasavallan Presidentti]] is usually regarded as progressive rock but it also had elements of [[jazz fusion]]. Live concerts often included long improvised solos by highly talented virtuosist. The [[UMO Jazz Orchestra]] was founded in 1975 which gave an opportunity to many [[Finnish jazz musicians]] to earn their living by playing jazz.
	
In the 1980s and 1990s, more talented, educated and professional jazz musicians got into jazz scene and Finnish jazz became more internationally recognized than ever. [[Jukka Linkola]], [[:fi:Jukka Perko|Jukka Perko]] and [[Tapani Rinne]] with his [[Rinneradio]] made music combined by many different musical styles. [[Iiro Rantala]], [[Rami Eskelinen]] and [[Eerik Siikasaari]] founded [[Trio Töykeät]] in 1988 and the band attained worldwide interest. Other important jazz musicians from this era are [[:fi:Severi Pyysalo|Severi Pyysalo]], [[:fi:Lenni-Kalle Taipale|Lenni-Kalle Taipale]], [[:fi:Verneri Pohjola|Verneri Pohjola]], Markus Ketola and [[:fi:Anna-Mari Kähärä|Anna-Mari Kähärä]] to name a few. [[:fi:Mape Lappalainen|Martti “Mape” Lappalainen]] founded Espoo Big Band and [[April Jazz]] festival in the 1980s.

After the 1990s, Finnish jazz has evolved further into many different musical directions and even [[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]s were used to create more unique sounds. [[:fi:The Five Corners Quintet|The Five Corners Quintet]], [[U-Street All Stars]] and [[Quintessence (Finnish band)|Quintessence]] played [[nu-jazz]] with electronic and pop influences. [[Oddarrang]], Dalindéo, Mopo, Teemu Viinikainen, [[:fi:Timo Lassy|Timo Lassy]], [[:fi:Jukka Eskola|Jukka Eskola]], Manuel Dunkel and [[Mikko Innanen (musician)|Mikko Innanen]] represent the present and future of Finnish jazz music. Today there are well over 200 professional jazz musicians in Finland.

===Revival in the modern age===

While a return to folk and socially active music was occurring in the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere across the world, the Finnish roots revival began in the 1960s. The [[Ilmajoki Music Festival]] and [[Kaustinen Folk Music Festival]], quickly became musical centers for the country and helped revitalize traditional Finnish folk music in a [[roots revival]]. The Runosong was revitalized by a new generation of performers, including [[Reijo Kela]], [[Kimmo Pohjonen]] and [[Heikki Laitinen]], who created the ''[[Kalevala (performance art)|Kalevala]]'' performance art piece.

The [[International Folk Music Festival]], established in 1968 in [[Kaustinen]], was a major event in the popularization of Finnish folk. The 1970s saw further revival of Finnish folk music, including artists like [[Konsta Jylhä]], [[JPP]] and [[Värttinä]]. Jylhä and his [[Purppuripelimannit]] band did the most to popular the scene in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Finnish Music Information Center|title=Finnish music|url=http://www.fimic.fi/fimic/fimic.nsf?open|accessdate=September 27, 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123185323/http://www.fimic.fi/fimic/fimic.nsf?open|archivedate=23 November 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, some non-Sami artists, including [[Enigma (musical artist)|Enigma]] and [[Jan Garbarek]], have used joik and other Sami styles in their music, while [[Marie Boine]] of Norway is probably the most internationally famous Sami star.  1996's critically acclaimed ''[[Suden Aika]]'' by [[Tellu Turkka]] saw a further return of runosong to the Finnish music scene.

The Finnish bagpipe, the [[säkkipilli]], though previously extinct, is also being revived by folk musicians such as Petri Prauda.

=== Popular opera ===

Since the 1960s, the [[Lahti Symphony Orchestra]]'s reputation as one of the most important Scandinavian orchestras was cemented by conductor [[Osmo Vänskä]]; this helped to cause a boom in opera's popularity during the 1980s, while the form was increasingly seen as archaic elsewhere. the Savonlinna Opera Festival reopened in 1967.

[[Martti Talvela]], [[Karita Mattila]] and [[Jorma Hynninen]] have become international opera stars, while composers like [[Kalevi Aho]], [[Olli Kortekangas]], [[Paavo Heininen]], [[Aulis Sallinen]], [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]], [[Atso Almila]] and [[Ilkka Kuusisto]] have written successful operas, with Rautavaara especially achieving international success.

=== Military music ===
[[File:Finland military band drums.jpg|thumb|The Conscript Band of the Finnish Defense Forces—drums]]

The '''Norwegian Media Authority''' ({{lang-no|Medietilsynet}}) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] administrative agency under the [[Norwegian Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs]] charged with various tasks relating to [[broadcasting]], newspapers and films.

The Authority's tasks include 
* rating movies
* enforcing rules on content, advertising and sponsorship for broadcast media; handling license applications for local broadcast media
* handling applications for [[press support|newspaper production grants]], including non-leading newspapers, minority language newspapers and [[Sami people|Sami]] newspapers
* overseeing and intervening against the acquisition of media ownership (either prohibiting the acquisition or merger, or allowing an acquisition on such conditions as the Authority sets, including ordering the [[divestment]] of other media ownership interests.

==History==
The agency was established 1 January 2005 by merging three government agencies:
* '''Norwegian Board of Film Classification''' (''Statens filmtilsyn''), which was in charge of rating movies.
* '''Norwegian Media Ownership Authority''' (''Eierskapstilsynet''), which oversaw media ownership.
* '''Mass Media Authority''' (''Statens medieforvaltning'', SMF), which had tasks related to broadcasting and newspapers.

The new authority was located in [[Fredrikstad]] from 20 March 2006, where the Mass Media Authority already was located, but in a new building.

In 2003, the agency was moved from Oslo to [[Fredrikstad]] from 20 March 2006, where the Mass Media Authority had been located. This was a program along with six other directorates and inspectorates which were move out of Oslo, which had been initialized by [[Victor Norman]], [[Minister of Government Administration and Reform (Norway)|Minister of Government Administration and Reform]] of the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]]. It cost 729 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK) to move the seven agencies. An official report from 2009 concluded that the agencies had lost 75 to 90% of their employees, mostly those with long seniority, and that for a while critical functions for society were dysfunctional. No costs reductions had been made, there was no significant impact on the target area, and there was little impact on the communication between the agencies and the ministries. In a 2010 report, Professor Jarle Trondal concluded that none of the agencies had become more independent after the move, despite this being one of the main arguments from the minister. Norman successor, [[Heidi Grande Røys]] of the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]], stated that the moving had had an important symbolic effect on the target areas, and that she did not see the lack of advantages as a reason to not move similar agencies later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/politikkSamfunn/article1689821.ece |title=Svekket av flytting |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=17 June 2009 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 January 2011 |archivedate=12 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vgc62Ypn?url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/politikkSamfunn/article1689821.ece |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/politikkSamfunn/article2058623.ece |title=Flytting av tilsyn ut av Oslo ga null effekt |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=12 January 2011 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 January 2011 |archivedate=12 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vgcD6t6S?url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/politikkSamfunn/article2058623.ece |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hallam Company''', which later became the '''American Company''' and then the '''Old American Company''',{{cn|date=February 2013}} was the first fully professional theatre company to perform in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Michael A. ''Shakespeare in North America'' in Wells, Stanley and Stanton, Sarah ''The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Stage'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002) pp.230-232&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was organised by [[William Hallam (theatre manager)|William Hallam]], former proprietor of the New Wells Theatre in London, and was led by his brother [[Lewis Hallam]]. Their company consisted of 12 adults and 3 children, drawn from English actors of "modest accomplishment". They arrived by the vessel ''Charming Sally'' at Yorktown, Virginia, on 2 June 1752, and made their early performances in nearby Williamsburg. Their first performance, ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', is generally considered to be the first professional staging of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] in America.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, p.230&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1753 the Hallam company moved to New York, and in 1754 they played in Philadelphia and in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1755 the company moved to the West Indies, and merged with the company of [[David Douglass (actor)|David Douglass]]. On Lewis' death, Douglass married his widow [[Sarah Hallam Douglass]]. Three years later, the company returned to tour the mainland, as the "American Company".&lt;ref name="Morrison, p.231"&gt;Morrison, p.231&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis' son, [[Lewis Hallam, Jr.]], eighteen at the time of the American Company's first tour, took leading roles alongside Douglass. Lewis Jr.'s style was described as declaratory rather than realistic, but he was much admired and became known as America's leading Shakespearean interpreter.&lt;ref name="Morrison, p.231"/&gt; Douglass had his limitations: one Alexander Graydon described him as "rather a decent than shining actor". However, he was a capable manager and he gave North America its first [[Falstaff]] and [[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]. Within the repertoire was ''[[Cymbeline]]'', which proved a popular vehicle for two of the company's actresses, [[Margaret Cheer]] and [[Nancy Hallam]].&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, pp.231-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In Quaker and Puritan areas, the company encountered religious opposition to theatre in general. At Rhode Island in 1761 they were obliged to perform Othello disguised as "a series of moral dialogues".&lt;ref name="Morrison, p.232"&gt;Morrison, p.232&lt;/ref&gt; In 1774, the [[Continental Congress]] banned theatre entirely, and the company resettled in Jamaica. By that time, Hugh F. Ranking calculates that the company had performed at least 180 times, their repertoire having included fourteen of Shakespeare's plays. After the peace of 1783, the company returned to New York, with Lewis Hallam Jr. as the leading actor, and [[John Henry (actor)|John Henry]] as his co-manager.&lt;ref name="Morrison, p.232"/&gt; 

Lewis Jr. is believed to be the first actor in America to perform in [[blackface]] in 1769.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tosches |first= Nick |title= Where Dead Voices Gather |publisher= Back Bay |year= 2002 |isbn= 0-316-89537-7 |page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Patriot Games''''' is a [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] novel, written by [[Tom Clancy]] and published on July 1987. It is the indirect sequel to ''[[Without Remorse]]'', and is chronologically the first book featuring [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]], the main character in most of Clancy’s novels. The novel focuses on Ryan being the target of Irish terrorist group Ulster Liberation Army for thwarting their kidnapping attempt on the [[Prince of Wales|Prince]] and [[Princess of Wales]] in [[London]]. It debuted at number one on [[the New York Times bestseller list]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The New York Times bestseller list for August 2, 1987 |url=http://www.hawes.com/1987/1987-08-02.pdf |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Patriot Games (film)|film adaptation]], starring [[Harrison Ford]] as Ryan, premiered on June 5, 1992.

==Plot summary==
A kidnapping attempt on the [[Prince of Wales|Prince]] and [[Princess of Wales]] and their infant son occurs at the [[the Mall, London|Mall in London]]. The attack is orchestrated by members of the Ulster Liberation Army, an ideologically [[Maoism|Maoist]] and ultra-radical Irish terrorist group splintered from the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]. However, [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]], who happens to be nearby, interferes with their operation, killing one of the attackers and incapacitating another, named Sean Miller, at the same time that Miller shoots him in the shoulder. Miller is later arrested.

While recovering from his shoulder wound, Ryan is honored by the British government and later becomes a knight. Meanwhile, Miller is sentenced to life imprisonment for the kidnapping attempt; however, his ULA compatriots led by Kevin O’Donnell free him while he is being transported to a maximum security prison in the [[Isle of Wight]]. They are then aided by Libyan allies in escaping into their secret training camp in the North African desert. Miller vows revenge on Ryan for making his recent operation fail.

Ryan is back teaching history in the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], relieved with the fact that the ULA will not attack him in the United States. Unbeknownst to him, Miller had persuaded his superior O’Donnell to launch an operation in the U.S. aimed at targeting Ryan and his family, and had recruited the assistance of an African-American domestic terrorist group referred to as “the Movement” to do so. While the op is an act of revenge, it is also designed to reduce American support for the rival PIRA, which is to be blamed for the upcoming attack. The assassin sent to kill Ryan at his place of work is intercepted before he manages to complete his task. However, his wife Cathy and their daughter Sally are seriously injured when Miller causes their car to crash on a freeway; they are later transported by helicopter to the [[University of Maryland Medical Center]] for treatment.

After the attack on his family, Ryan accepts an offer from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) to start working as an analyst at their headquarters, partly to collect more information about the previously little-known ULA. Later, the Prince and Princess of Wales come to visit Ryan at his house in Maryland. However, this provides another opportunity for the ULA to strike, once again recruiting the services of “the Movement”. The night of the visit, they launch a sneak attack on Ryan’s home and kidnap the Prince and Princess of Wales, as well as Ryan’s family.

Although several guards around the house, including [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] personnel, are killed, Ryan, his friend, fighter pilot Robert “Robby” Jackson, and the Prince manage to kill some of the terrorists. They later receive assistance from the local police, the [[United States Marines]], and sailors from the U.S. Naval Academy, who prevent the remaining terrorists from escaping the country in a container ship. Ryan encounters a cornered Miller and tries to kill him, but is restrained by his weapons instructor. After the ULA terrorists are apprehended, he arrives in [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]] to witness the birth of his son, [[Jack Ryan, Jr.]]

==Themes==
''Patriot Games'' was notable for subverting the moral ambiguity of the antagonists in espionage novels by [[John le Carré]], [[Len Deighton]], and [[Robert Ludlum]]. According to Marc Cerasini’s essay on the novel, “Clancy’s sensible revulsion toward the terrorists is so strident and intense...that it verges on the physical.” He added that “the author’s understandable disgust toward his villains is ‘[[bourgeois]]’, for there is not a shred of sympathy for these Irish ‘patriots’.” 

The novel is also said to be inspired by the [[gothic horror]] genre in the depiction of the ULA as “twisted political misfits” who practice political violence in the vein of [[Count Dracula]] and his “family”, as well as other gothic elements like the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenberg |first1=Martin H. |title=The Tom Clancy Companion |date=2005 |pages=15-17 |edition=Revised |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Clancy started working on ''Patriot Games'' in 1979, along with other novels which would later be published: ''[[The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Cardinal of the Kremlin]]'' (1988). He says of his passion for accuracy and detail: "When I was in London, researching ''Patriot Games'', I spent 20 hours walking around the Mall with a camera, clipboard and tape recorder, just choreographing my opening chapter, to make sure it would happen exactly the way I wrote it. Later, when I took my kids there, I could tell them, 'This is the tree that Jack Ryan hid his wife and daughter behind, and that's the road where the bad guys escaped.' I feel a moral obligation to my readers to get it right. In the insurance business, you have to pay attention to details or a client could lose everything. A doctor has to, a cop, a fireman, why not a writer?" Although he was criticized for doubling down on technical details in the novel, Clancy considers ''Patriot Games'' to be his best.

Discussing about the final scene where Jack Ryan lets the primary antagonist Sean Miller live instead of killing him, Clancy remarked: "Of all the letters I got on ''Patriot Games'', not one said, 'He should have killed the little bastard.' Personally I'd have done it. You harm my kids and I'll blow you away. You don't touch my kids. But I'm not Jack Ryan. He has to be in control. He plays by the rules."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Anderson |first1=Patrick |title=KING OF THE 'TECHNO-THRILLER' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/01/magazine/king-of-the-techno-thriller.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Commercially, ''Patriot Games'' debuted at number one on [[the New York Times bestseller list]] for the week of August 2, 1987. It has since sold over 1,063,000 hardcover copies by the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Masley |first1=Peter |last2=Streitfeld |first2=Peter |title=NOVELIST CLANCY EMBROILED IN DISPUTE OVER COPYRIGHT |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1988/03/10/novelist-clancy-embroiled-in-dispute-over-copyright/0fb801f6-f011-459d-b1e6-dbd2078ed93b/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.2a08055d97b1|website=The Washington Post |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critically, the book received generally positive reviews. ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised it as "a powerful piece of popular fiction; its plot, if implausible, is irresistible, and its emotions are universal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=KING OF THE 'TECHNO-THRILLER'}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Kirkus Reviews]]'s verdict is mixed, stating that "Exciting shoot-outs and chases, and lots of Royal wish-fulfillment; but without naval authenticity to bolster the prose, Clancy is a fish out of water."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PATRIOT GAMES by Tom Clancy |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/tom-clancy/patriot-games/ |website=Kirkus Reviews |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
{{Main|Patriot Games (film)}}
The novel was adapted as a [[Patriot Games (film)|feature film]], which was released on June 5, 1992. Jack Ryan was played by [[Harrison Ford]] and Sean Miller was played by [[Sean Bean]]. The film is notable for being the sequel to the previous movie ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1990), although the order is the opposite in the books. Additionally, the Prince and Princess of Wales were replaced by Lord Holmes, [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] and the Queen's cousin, as the ULA's primary target. ''Patriot Games'' spent two weeks as the No. 1 film, eventually grossing $178,051,587 in worldwide box office business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&amp;id=patriotgames.htm |accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has garnered generally positive reviews, and earned a 73% "Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 33 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rotten Tomatoes |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/patriot_games/ |accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the movie was criticized by Clancy for deviating too much from the source material, stating that "I don't like eating dirt, and I won't eat any from these guys." "There is only one, maybe two, scenes in the shooting script that correspond to a scene in the book," Clancy later added. "They have a movie called ''Patriot Games'' that uses my characters—but it's not my story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yardley |first1=Jonathan |title=TOM CLANCY: FIRING, AND MISSING |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1992/01/27/tom-clancy-firing-and-missing/73d46b1d-a2b2-445d-bb9a-f12c8d9f4ab0/?utm_term=.27f16304a7b8 |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually asked for his name to be removed from the film's promotional materials, and in an apparent countermove, entered negotiations with the same team at [[Paramount Pictures]] to sell the rights to his other novel ''[[The Sum of All Fears]]'' (1989). By the time the film was released in 2002, the author had cooled off on the idea of having his books made into films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brew |first1=Simon |title=Why Tom Clancy's Name Isn't on the Patriot Games Poster |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/tom-clancy/274352/why-tom-clancy-s-name-isn-t-on-the-patriot-games-poster |website=Den of Geek |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Henslowe'''&lt;ref&gt;In his lifetime, "Henslowe was spelled 'Henslowe' or 'Hinshley' (and variations thereof) with no apparent rhyme or reason. In a single document (the 1587 deed of partnership with John Cholmley) the name is spelled 'Hinshley,' 'Henslow,' and 'Hinshleye'; Henslowe himself sometimes signed his name 'Henslow,' sometimes 'Hensley'..." David Kathman. [http://shakespeareauthorship.com/name1.html#3 "The Spelling and Pronunciation of Shakespeare's Name: Pronunciation."]&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 1550 – 6 January 1616) was an [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] theatrical entrepreneur and [[impresario]]. Henslowe's modern reputation rests on the survival of his diary, a primary source for information about the theatrical world of Renaissance London. He was portrayed by actor [[Geoffrey Rush]] in the Academy Award-winning film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]''.

==Life==
Henslowe was born in [[Lindfield, West Sussex|Lindfield]], [[Sussex]], into a family with roots in [[Devon]]. His father, Edmund Henslowe, was appointed Master of the Game for [[Ashdown Forest]], Sussex, from 1539 until his death in 1562. Before Edmund Henslowe's death, his daughter Margaret had married [[Ralf Hogge]], an ironmaster.

By the 1570s, Henslowe had moved to London, becoming a member of the [[Worshipful Company of Dyers|Dyers' Company]]. Henslowe is recorded working as assistant to Henry Woodward, reputed to be the [[bailiff]] for [[Viscount Montague]], owner of [[Cowdray House]] and [[Battle Abbey]] in Sussex. Henslowe married Woodward's widow, Agnes, and from 1577 lived in [[Southwark]], opposite [[the Clink]] prison. His elder brother Edmund, a merchant, also owned property in Southwark. It was at one time assumed that his wife's inheritance gave Henslowe his start in business, but there is no evidence.

His success in business appears to have brought him some social prominence. By the early-17th century, he was a [[vestryman]], [[churchwarden]] and [[overseer of the poor]] in St Saviour's ward in [[Southwark]]. During the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], he was a [[Groom of the Chamber]]. Under [[James I of England|James I]], he served as a Gentleman Sewer of the Chamber. Henslowe also served as a collector of the [[History of the English fiscal system|Lay Subsidy]].

Henslowe died in 1616 in London, still actively involved in the theatre.

==Business interests==
Henslowe developed extensive business interests, including dyeing, starch-making, [[pawnbroker|pawn-broking]], money lending and trading in goat skins. He owned property in [[East Grinstead]] and [[Buxted]], Sussex, where his brother-in-law, [[Ralf Hogge]], lived. Between 1576 and 1586, Henslowe was involved in the trade in timber from Ashdown Forest. However, his main activity was as a [[landlord]] in Southwark.  One of his authors, [[Henry Chettle]], described him as being unscrupulously harsh with his poor tenants, even though Henslowe made many loans to Chettle and they seem to have been on friendly terms.

===Theatrical interests===
In 1584, Henslowe purchased a property known as The Little Rose, in Southwark, which contained rose gardens and, almost certainly, a [[brothel]]. In 1587, Henslowe and John Cholmley built [[The Rose (theatre)|The Rose]], the third of the large, permanent playhouses in London, and the first in [[Bankside]].  From 1591, Henslowe partnered with the [[Admiral's Men]] after that company split with [[The Theatre]]'s [[James Burbage]] over the division of receipts.  [[Edward Alleyn]], the Admiral's' lead actor, married Henslowe's stepdaughter Joan in 1592, and they worked in partnership.

In 1598 Burbage's company (by then, the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]]) erected the new [[Globe Theatre]] in Bankside; Henslowe moved the Admiral's Men to the north-western corner of the city, into a venue he had financed, the [[Fortune Playhouse|Fortune Theatre]]. [[John Taylor (poet)|John Taylor]], the "Water Poet", petitioned the King on behalf of the [[Company of Watermen and Lightermen|Watermen's Company]], because of the expected loss of business transporting theatre patrons across the Thames.

He also had interests in the [[Newington Butts Theatre]] and [[The Swan (theatre)|The Swan Theatre]] in Southwark.

===Animal shows===
Henslowe and Alleyn also operated the [[Beargarden|Paris Garden]], a venue for [[bait (dogs)|baitings]]; early in James's reign, they purchased the office of Keeper of the Royal Game, namely bulls, bears and mastiffs. In 1614, he and Jacob Meade built the [[Hope Theatre]] in Bankside; designed with a moveable stage for both plays and animal baiting, it was the last of the large open-roof theatres built before 1642. The animal shows ended up ascendant at this venue. The introduction to [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]'', performed at the Hope in [[1614 in literature|1614]], complains that the theatre is "as dirty as [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], and as stinking every whit." The theatre did not have a regular theatrical tenant after 1617; Henslowe's share in it was willed to Alleyn.

==Henslowe's diary==
Henslowe's "diary" is a valuable source of information on the [[English Renaissance theatre|theatrical]] history of the period. It is a collection of memoranda and notes that record payments to writers, [[box office]] takings, and lists of money lent. Also of interest are records of the purchase of expensive costumes and of [[Theatrical properties|stage properties]], such as the dragon in [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'', which provide insight into the staging of plays in [[Elizabethan theatre]].

The diary is written on the reverse of pages of a book of accounts of his brother-in-law Ralf Hogge's ironworks, kept by his brother John Henslowe for the period 1576&amp;ndash;1581. Hogge was the Queen's Gunstonemaker, and produced both iron [[cannon]] and shot for the [[Royal Armouries]] at the [[Tower of London]].  John Henslowe seems to have acted as his agent, and Philip prudently reused his old account book. These entries are a valuable source for the early [[History of ferrous metallurgy|iron-making]] industry.

The diary begins covering Henslowe's theatrical activities for 1592. Entries continue, with varying degrees of thoroughness (authors' names were not included before 1597), until 1609; in the years before his death, Henslowe appears to have run his theatrical interests from a greater distance. At some time after his death, his papers, including the diary, were transferred to [[Dulwich College]], which Alleyn had founded.

Henslowe recorded payments to twenty-seven Elizabethan [[playwright]]s. He variously commissioned, bought and produced plays by, or made loans to [[Ben Jonson]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]], [[Henry Chettle]], [[George Chapman]], [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]], [[John Webster]], [[Anthony Munday]], [[Henry Porter (playwright)|Henry Porter]], [[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]], [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]] and [[Michael Drayton]]. The diary shows the varying partnerships between writers, in an age when many plays were collaborations. It also shows Henslowe to have been a careful man of business, obtaining security in the form of rights to his authors' works, and holding their manuscripts, while tying them to him with loans and advances.  If a play was successful, Henslowe would commission a sequel.

Performances of works with titles similar to Shakespearean plays, such as a ''[[Hamlet]]'', a ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'', a ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', a ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' and a ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' are mentioned in the diary with no author listed.  Most of these plays were recorded when the [[Admiral's Men]] and the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] briefly joined forces when the playhouses were closed owing to the plague (June 1594).

In 1599, Henslowe paid Dekker and [[Henry Chettle]] for a play called ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', which is probably the play currently known as British Museum MS. Add 10449 (the actors' names that appear in the plot connect it to the Admiral's Men and date it between March 1598 and July 1600). 
There is no mention of [[William Shakespeare]] (or for that matter [[Richard Burbage]]) in Henslowe's diary (despite the forgeries of [[John Payne Collier]]); this is due to the fact that Shakespeare and Burbage were during most of their career not connected to Henslowe's theatre. Shakespeare's company, the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], performed at [[The Theatre]] (starting in 1594) and later [[The Globe Theatre]] (starting in 1599).

==The history of the diary==
The papers first came to critical attention in 1780, when [[Edmond Malone]] requested them from the Dulwich College library; the papers had been misplaced and were not found until 1790.  Malone made a transcript of the parts he viewed as relevant to his [[variorum]] edition of Shakespeare. The original was returned to Dulwich after Malone's death. (Malone's transcript was returned to the library around 1900.) The next scholar to examine the manuscripts was [[John Payne Collier]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7841">'''Play value''' is the essential value of a [[toy]] or [[game]] for [[Play (activity)|play]].
The term is frequently employed in the field of [[child development]] and playwork for the assessment of toys, games, equipment and spaces.  When they are fun and engaging, playthings and spaces are said to have play value; those that are quickly discarded or are considered uninteresting do not. In short, objects of play must be compelling and encourage the child's involvement in order to have true play value.  Play value has been defined as 'how much play can you get out of something'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Shelly Newstead |title=The Buskers Guide to Playwork |publisher=[http://www.commonthreads.org.uk Common Threads Publications Ltd] |year=2004 |isbn=1-904792-13-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classic toys are examples of toys with true play value as they continue to provide new discoveries 
and adventures in each subsequent session of play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=FAO Schwarz Toys For A Lifetime: Enhancing Childhood Through Play |publisher=Stevanne Auerbach |year=1999 |isbn=0-7893-0355-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment of play value in the selection of toys and games ==
The selection of toys and games has long been a concern to parents and educators. Many fail to 
sufficiently engage children.  [[Stevanne Auerbach]] emphasizes that products should last as long
as possible and have many different and long lasting uses.  Good examples of toys with
high play value are [[Toy block|blocks]], [[Construction set|construction toys]] and [[yo-yo]]s.  The toy should have clear
instructions so the parent and child are guided to its best use by the designer and
manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Dr. Toy's Smart Play Smart Toys (How To Raise A Child With a High PQ (Play Quotient)) |publisher=Stevanne Auerbach |year=2004 |isbn=0-9785540-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In playwork terms it is the child who determines the play value of an object rather than adults or instruction manuals

== Multiple uses ==

Toys tend to have high play value when they may be used, engaged and employed in manifold ways. 
A good example is [[Lego|Lego bricks]] which may be assembled and connected in myriad ways to
make cars, trucks, planes, trains, etc. 
Another good example is [[polymer clay]] which may be used for sculpting hand-shaped items,
such as beads, jewelry, and charms.

== Self-directed play ==
Children need to be in charge of their own play activity. According to PBS' '''The Whole Child''' Web site
when adults plan the play activity and structure the outcome of playtime it is far less effective than if children have the freedom to form their own ideas, practice skills and use playthings at their own speed. [[Cardboard box|Cardboard box toys]] are an example of playthings which allow children to
use their own imaginations.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wholechild/providers/play.html PBS - The Whole Child: ABC's of Child Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appeal to more than one age or stage of development ==
Playability is a word that when applied to games has a similar meaning to play value. Those games with strong playability appeal to more than one age or stage of development.  For example, [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] and [[Risk]]
are two games that appeal to a wide range of ages, though generally not to very young children. Similarly, toys that appeal to more than one age or stage tend to have higher play value.

== Inverse relationship with linkage to TV, movies and video games ==
Authors Nancy Carlsson-Paige &amp; Diane Levin&lt;ref name=carlsson_paige_levin&gt;[http://www.parentingbookmark.com/pages/NCP03.htm Nancy Carlsson-Paige &amp; Diane Levin]&lt;/ref&gt; note that play value in toys can be seen as inversely related to their degree of linkage with TV, movies and video games.
For example, [[G.I. Joe]], [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]], and [[Power Rangers]]
are all examples of toys that have cross-feeds with television shows that have violent themes.
Similarly, [[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]], [[Small Soldiers]], [[Spawn (film)|Spawn]], [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]] and [[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]
toys are marketed to children 4 and up.

== Complement or supplement other play activities ==
[[Personal computer game|Computer games]] or electronic toys are examples of toys that can complement or supplement other play
activities.  According to author Cathrine Neilsen-Hewett,&lt;ref name=neilsen_hewett&gt;[http://www.earlylearningcentre.com.au/Store/members/parent009.aspx Cathrine Neilsen-Hewett]&lt;/ref&gt; while often stimulating, engaging and fun, these toys should never become a substitute for traditional play activities such as drawing, pretending, or block building. Instead, electronic games are best thought of as adding to or reinforcing other kinds of play, and are not a suitable replacement for parental
interaction and attention.
[[File:Children marbles.jpg|thumb|Children playing with marbles]]

== Stay with children as they develop ==
Classic toys such as [[Mr. Potato Head]], the [[Radio Flyer (company)|Radio
Flyer wagon]] and [[Snakes and ladders|Chutes and Ladders]] or in a general sense, spanning generations, the [[teddy bear]], stay with a child as he or she develops new interests and matures. They "stand the test of time", and evolved can accompany a child into more and more elaborate play when social surroundings, life and a knowledge of history (for example) create diversified and extended ideas.

Organized toy kingdoms can grow up in the rooms of European children. Named [[stuffed animal]]s or [[doll]]s often occupy lifelong positions of honor, as visualized [[imaginary friend]]s, in the lifetimes of sociable people with many real friends.

== Promote respectful interaction ==
Toys have greater play value that promote respectful, non-violent and non-stereotyped interaction 
among children.  For example, [[Barbie]] is an example of a toy that reinforces [[Gender role|gender stereotypes]] for girls
despite its status as a classic toy.

== Useful for further learning ==
Play value from a child development perspective is enhanced by toys and games that help children develop skills useful
for further learning and mastery such as [[Scrabble]] and [[The Game of Life]] &lt;ref name=truce&gt;[http://www.truceteachers.org/toyactionguide.html#choosing TRUCE]&lt;/ref&gt; In playwork terms - play value is the individual child's subjective assessment of the space and the equipment available to them, rather than a pre-conceived adult idea about what sorts of play are 'valuable'. 'Play value' and 'the value of play' are two separate judgements in playwork - the former chiefly made by children, and the latter chiefly made by adults.

'''''Really Rosie''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with a book and lyrics by [[Maurice Sendak]] and music by [[Carole King]]. The musical is based on Sendak's books ''Chicken Soup with Rice'', ''Pierre'', ''One was Johnny'', ''Alligators All Around'' (which compose 1962's ''The Nutshell Library''), and ''The Sign on Rosie's Door'' (1960). Sendak based the story on a demonstrative little girl who used to sing and dance on the stoop of her building, whom he observed while he was a little boy growing up in Brooklyn.

The musical has become a mainstay of [[children's theater]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.ku.edu/2004/04N/FebNews/Feb5/rosie.html "KU Theater for Young People to stage Sendak's ''Really Rosie'' in February,"] [[University of Kansas]], February 5, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It follows a typical summer day in the life of the Nutshell Kids, a group of several neighborhood friends, including Pierre, Alligator, Johnny, and Chef Jeff (also known as "Chicken Soup") from the ''Nutshell Library'' books, and Rosie and Kathy from ''The Sign on Rosie's Door''. Rosie, the self-proclaimed sassiest kid on her block of [[Brooklyn]]'s Avenue P, entertains everyone by directing and starring in a movie based on the exciting, dramatic, funny (and slightly exaggerated) story of her life. During its off-Broadway run, the lead role of Rosie was first played by a then-12-year-old [[Tisha Campbell|Tisha Campbell-Martin]]. Midway through the run, Tisha left the cast and was replaced by cast member and "Rosie" understudy Angela Coin, age 10. Angela also sang the role of "Rosie" on the cast recording. 

A half-hour [[animation|animated]] television special aired on [[CBS]] TV in February 1975. It was directed by Maurice Sendak, with [[Carole King]] voicing the title character. King was ultimately selected as the voice of Rosie when casting directors had difficulty selecting a child actor whose voice could compliment the pre-recorded songs.  An album based on the songs by King and lyrics by Sendak is available on [[Ode Records|Ode]]/[[Epic Records|Epic]]/[[Sony Music Entertainment|SME Records]]. In the animated special, only the first seven songs and ''Really Rosie (Reprise)'' were showcased. Sendak expanded the piece for London and Washington, DC, stage productions in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;[http://biography.jrank.org/pages/1957/Sendak-Maurice-1928.html "Maurice Sendak (1928– ) Biography."] Retrieved from JRank.org on August 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[off-Broadway]] production, directed and [[choreographed]] by [[Patricia Birch]] with designs by Sendak, which opened on October 14, 1980, at the [[Westside Theatre]], where it ran for 274 performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lortel.org/lla_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&amp;id=2564 Lortel.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Rosie and the Nutshell Kids (Kathy, Johnny, Alligator, Pierre and "Chicken Soup") live on the same block on Avenue P in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. On a hot July Saturday, the children are bored and need something to do. Rosie imagines herself as a talented star, and decides to produce an imaginary movie musical about her life and in particular the demise of her brother Chicken Soup, to be called ''Did You Hear What Happened to Chicken Soup?''

She gets her friends to audition for a role in the film, but they begin to fight over casting. A thunderstorm forces them to move into the cellar for shelter. To keep the kids' attention, Rosie decides that they need to show the producer the movie's big finale number. She gets them all to close their eyes and imagine the producer inviting them to make her movie. Afterward, when the children go home, Rosie remains to dream of stardom in her big number.

===Home media===

'''''Saints Row 2''''' is a 2008 [[open world]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Volition (company)|Volition]] and published by [[THQ]]. It was released in October 2008 for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], and ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] in early 2009, and to [[Linux]] in 2016. A [[Saints Row 2 (mobile)|mobile tie-in version]] was developed by G5 Entertainment and released the same month. The game is the second title and first [[cross-platform]] release in the ''[[Saints Row (series)|Saints Row]]'' series, following 2006's ''[[Saints Row (video game)|Saints Row]]''. It is succeeded by 2011's ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]'' and 2013's ''[[Saints Row IV]]''.

Set in the fictional city of [[Stilwater]] five years after the events of ''Saints Row'', players control the same protagonist and lead a new order of Third Street Saints gang against the three rival gangs occupying their turf and the corrupt Ultor Corporation conglomerate. Players navigate the open world and unlock missions by spending Respect, a currency earned by completing numerous off-mission activities. Two players can [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperatively]] progress through the game's story mode and participate in all activities. The player may also compete in 12-player [[deathmatch]]es.

The developers opted for a more comedic tone to set the game apart from ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', a series featuring common gameplay elements. The game's promotional effort included various public showings, [[special edition]]s and [[downloadable content]] including the ''[[Saints Row 2: Ultor Exposed|Ultor Exposed]]'' and ''[[Saints Row 2: Corporate Warfare|Corporate Warfare]]'' mission packages. Reviews were largely favorable, praising the action and straightforward gameplay, while criticizing technical issues. Reviewers were less receptive to the Windows port, citing worse technical issues. The game had sold around 400,000 units by November 2008, and at least 3.4 million units by September 2010.

== Gameplay ==

''Saints Row 2'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game set in an [[open world]] environment, offering the player a large open environment in which to move around. The player's character is capable of maneuvering through the environment, utilizing weaponry and engaging in [[melee]] combat warfare.&lt;ref name="sr2aus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="donovan"/&gt; After successfully completing the first game mission, the player is able to explore the environment and choose how they wish to play the game. Missions are unlocked by earning 'respect' points from [[minigame]]s and side-missions&lt;ref name="kotaku impressions"/&gt; and although completing missions is necessary for game progression, players can complete them at their own leisure. The player is granted the option of instantly retrying the missions should they fail an attempt. Numerous [[Continue point|checkpoints]] save progress in each mission, and missions can be replayed from locations within the environment. Aside from attempting missions, the player can explore the environment, purchase items at shops and participate in the aforementioned mini-games and side-missions.&lt;ref name="activities trailer"/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2014}} The player can also wreak havoc upon the environment which can provoke potentially fatal attention from authoritative forces.&lt;ref name="busey sr2"/&gt; The player can recruit members from a friendly gang and use a mobile phone to contact friends and/or businesses, as well as to input cheat codes.&lt;ref name="ukhandson"/&gt; Entering cheats will disable Xbox 360 achievements.

Players drive vehicles that are stolen, bought or unlocked. Aside from automobiles, players can use boats and [[Personal water craft|water craft]],&lt;ref name="kotaku details"/&gt; helicopters,&lt;ref name="gary preview"/&gt; [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and&lt;ref name="impressions"/&gt; motorcycles.&lt;ref name="busey sr2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign first look"/&gt; A [[cruise control]] system can be activated while using land or sea vehicles.&lt;ref name="Auto97-3"/&gt; [[Waypoint]]s can be placed on the pause-screen map, leaving a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] route between the player character's location and the set destination. Players can hail [[taxicab]] services and pay a fee to quickly navigate the city. By taking land vehicles to [[Mechanic]]s, players can apply paint schemes, [[Car tuning|body mods]], [[hydraulics]] and [[nitrous oxide]].

Players create their own character through a system that allows them to modify gender, ethnicity, fitness, voice, face and hairstyle.&lt;ref name="gamespot first look"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku on sr2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign details"/&gt; Walk and fighting styles, and personality traits can be assigned.&lt;ref name = ukhandson/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ign first look"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign details"/&gt; Players purchase clothes, tattoos and piercings, and set outfits can be bought or created and saved to the player character's wardrobe.&lt;ref name = "gary preview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sr2 impressions"/&gt; "Cribs" ([[safe house]]s) allow players to withdraw earnings, change outfits, replay missions and save the game.&lt;ref name="gamespot first look"/&gt; Cribs can be customized by applying themes and purchasing objects like TVs and pool tables.&lt;ref name = "ign first look"/&gt; Boats and fixed-wing aircraft can be stored at purchased [[dock (maritime)|docks]] and [[hangar]]s. Players select the outfits, vehicles, gestures and graffiti styles used by street members of the Third Street Saints.&lt;ref name="tera preview"/&gt;

The combat systems from ''Saints Row'' have been updated but many of the basics remain unchanged.&lt;ref name="donovan"/&gt; While engaging in melee-based combat, the player character will perform [[combo (gaming)|combos]] and charge up attacks,&lt;ref name="sr2 impressions"/&gt; and can execute a [[finishing move]] if three consecutive hits are dealt.&lt;ref name = ukhandson/&gt; With a gun equipped, the player can perform a groin attack, and can zoom in for a finer aim [[reticle]].&lt;ref name = "ign details"/&gt; The player can also employ the use of human shields,&lt;ref name = ukhandson/&gt; and can use makeshift weapons pulled from the environment e.g. fire hydrants, cement blocks.&lt;ref name="gamespot first look"/&gt; Should the player either commit illegal activities or incite rival gang members, they will provoke potentially fatal attention from authoritative figures or rival gangs. The notoriety bar is a visual representation of the proactivity of the opposing figures' response and continual inciting of these groups will bring about a more powerful response, such as [[SWAT]] teams from the police. The player will continue to be chased by these groups until captured or killed and must reduce the notoriety bar by either hiding from the police or gang and wait for it to "cool off", or by seeking out a drive-through confessional which will clear the notoriety bar for a small fee.&lt;ref name="busey sr2"/&gt; Should the player character be apprehended or killed, a small percentage of the player's earnings will be removed and the player will [[respawn]] at law or healthcare institutions. The game contains over forty different weapons, many of which have been recycled from ''Saints Row''. The game allows the player to utilise new weapon types, examples of which include [[satchel charge]]s, [[laser guidance|laser-guided]] rocket launchers, chainsaws and more.&lt;ref name="weaponsvehicles trailer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-4"/&gt; The player has the ability to [[dual wield]] handguns and submachine guns. Weaponry can be purchased by the player from specific stores or unlocked throughout in-game progress.&lt;ref name = impressions/&gt;

=== Open world ===
Players navigate the [[open world]], fictional city of [[Stilwater]]. The city consists of forty-five neighborhoods divided between twenty districts. It is expanded from ''Saints Row''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s version of Stilwater, roughly one-and-a-half times as big and featuring new districts such as the prison, nuclear power plant, and expanded airport among others.&lt;ref name="ign details" /&gt; Game developers stated that the city has very much been redeveloped and each individual neighborhood has been touched up in one way or another.&lt;ref name="wp interview"/&gt; According to the storyline, the in-game corporation Ultor spent more than three-hundred million dollars redeveloping the city,&lt;ref name="ign details" /&gt; funding the police force and, as it states, turning the "once crime-ridden third-tier city" into an "urban utopia". The Saints Row district is a more notable change within the city, having been completely redesigned and serving as the location of Ultor's headquarters; a towering [[skyscraper]] referred to as the Phillips Building.&lt;ref name="ge interview"/&gt; Many old districts from the earlier revision of Stilwater have also seen changes. Examples include the expansion taken place on the Suburbs district, which is double the size of its depiction in ''Saints Row'' and the Museum district, which features the Eramenos [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] museum exhibit, complete with models of the [[Acropolis of Athens]] and [[Theatre of Dionysus]].&lt;ref name="saints row 2"/&gt; There are also several completely new districts, such as the Marina and the University.&lt;ref name="wp interview" /&gt;

From the beginning of the game, the map of Stilwater is fully visible. However, shops and activities will simply be displayed as a question mark until the player discovers them. By completing missions and wiping out enemy strongholds the player gains control of the various neighborhoods the city is split into. There are over 130 interiors within the city, and hidden events can be triggered by some,&lt;ref name="kotaku details" /&gt; including over ninety shops which can be purchased when the player controls each shops' associated territory.&lt;ref name="tera preview" /&gt; The player gets a 10% discount at owned stores and buying an entire chain of departments will mean that the protagonist's face appears on in-game billboard advertisements.&lt;ref name="tera preview" /&gt; The game shares technology with that of ''[[Red Faction: Guerrilla]]'', another Volition-developed game and so certain elements of the environment are fully destructible.&lt;ref name="ukhandson" /&gt; A number of [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] are placed within the sandbox, including the pop-out [[Easter Bunny]] which won "Top Easter Egg of 2008".&lt;ref name="Auto97-5"/&gt;

===Respect system===

The Respect system is a [[Score (game)#Video games|scoring]] system where the player earns Respect points to unlock missions and progress through the storyline. The player can partake in storyline and stronghold missions only after filling up at least one bar of Respect, and Respect points are removed when the player starts a mission. The 'style rank' is a modifier of how much Respect the player can earn; this is increased by purchasing items for the player character. Respect points can be earned in two ways; by progressing through side-missions called Activities and by completing mini-games and stunts called Diversions.&lt;ref name = "kotaku impressions"/&gt;

There are a broad range of Activities and Diversions available for the player to progress through. Many of the game's Activities made appearance in ''Saints Row'' and a variety of new Activities have also been introduced in the game.&lt;ref name="activities trailer"/&gt; Examples include an underground fight club, a parody of the ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]'' television show known as FUZZ and numerous others.&lt;ref name="sr2 impressions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="actdiv"/&gt; Each Activity can be initiated from various locations and plays out over six levels of increasing difficulty. The Activities have been designed to suit solo and co-operative play.&lt;ref name="Auto97-6"/&gt; Most Diversions do not have specific start points. There are numerous Diversions playable in the game, such as acts of [[indecent exposure]], combat and driving stunts, [[car surfing]] and a [[survival horror]] minigame called Zombie Uprising.&lt;ref name=sr2aus/&gt;&lt;ref name="actdiv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-8"/&gt;

===Multiplayer===
''Saints Row 2'' has various [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] components implemented throughout the game. Through an online network or through [[System Link]]ing, the player can progress through the game with a [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] partner.&lt;ref name="Auto97-9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot co-op"/&gt; While in co-op mode, both players can explore the city and progress through the game's storyline missions and minigames.&lt;ref name="gamespot co-op"/&gt;&lt;ref name="destructoid mp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-10"/&gt; Both players are rewarded and credited for completion of such activities,&lt;ref name="gamespot co-op"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-11"/&gt; and the players can furthermore play against each other in competitive [[metagaming|metagames]].&lt;ref name="Auto97-12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ultor ign"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-13"/&gt; The co-op mode is "drop-in/drop-out" and there is no limit as to how far the players can be away from each other.&lt;ref name="kotaku details"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot co-op"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-14"/&gt;

The game contains [[multiplayer video game|competitive multiplayer]] modes, supporting between four and twelve players in a match.&lt;ref name="gamespot mp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-15"/&gt; There are two standard [[Deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] modes; the free-for-all "Gangsta Brawl" mode and its team-based variant, "Team Gangsta Brawl".&lt;ref name="vg mp"/&gt; Another mode, known as "Strong Arm", puts two teams against each other fighting for control over the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="destructoid mp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-16"/&gt; In "Strong Arm", the first team to earn $100,000,000 dollars wins and money is earned by competing head-to-head in activities, controlling "[[Graffiti|tag]] spots" which serve as bonus modifiers or by eliminating members of the opposing team.&lt;ref name="Auto97-18"/&gt; While in a party, players are free to roam around a lobby.&lt;ref name="vg mp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku mp"/&gt; The player can rank up in multiplayer and displays this by earning various "badges" which are displayed next to the player's name.&lt;ref name="kotaku mp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-19"/&gt; By ranking up, the player can unlock more expensive clothing for their multiplayer character.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The multiplayer mode on PC and PlayStation 3 was discontinued in May 2014 when [[GameSpy]]'s servers were shut down.&lt;ref name="RPS: closure"/&gt; However, the PC version's multiplayer can still be played via LAN tunneling software such as Evolve or Tunngle and the PS3 version's multiplayer can still be played using [[XLink Kai]]. The Xbox 360 versions of the game were unaffected as they use [[Xbox Live]] for matchmaking.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.saintsrow.com/community/go/thread/view/136773/30254829/Gamespy_shutdown_and_Saints_Row_2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
It has been five years since the events of the original [[Saints Row (video game)|''Saints Row'']]. Following the sudden disappearance of founder Julius Little, the 3rd Street Saints fell apart. In its place, three new gangs divide up Stilwater: the Brotherhood, an outlaw gang specializing in arms trafficking, the Ronin, a Japanese ''[[bosozoku]]'' gang that runs a network of casinos, porn distribution rings and strip clubs, and the Sons of Samedi, a Haitian [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] gang that supplies most of the city's drugs. Johnny Gat, Julius's former chief lieutenant, is charged with 387 counts of murder and faces the death penalty. His girlfriend Aisha, despite having been forced to fake her death in the previous game, has become a record producer in her own right. After an earthquake leveled Stilwater, the Ultor Corporation bought up most of the land and converted it into a massive financial district run as their own personal fiefdom. The other remaining Saints have abandoned the gang; Dexter Jackson is now a security consultant for Ultor, and Troy Bradshaw, who was responsible for Julius's downfall, has been named the new Chief of Police.

===Plot===
After the explosion on Alderman Richard Hughes' yacht, the player fell into a coma and was taken to Stilwater's maximum security prison to undergo extensive plastic surgery. Five years later, Carlos Mendoza, the brother of a former Saint, infiltrates the infirmary and helps the player escape. After arriving at the city, the player is informed by Carlos about the demise of the 3rd Street Saints; Julius went missing, Troy Bradshaw became the Chief of Police, and many Saints members were either killed or jailed. After arriving at a bar, the player discovers that Johnny Gat is on trial for 387 murders and looks set for death row. The player breaks into the courtroom and rescues Johnny, taking him to Aisha's house, where they discuss on how to revive the Saints. After learning that the church was turned into a tourist trap, the player and Johnny take over an underground mission and establish as their new headquarters, and soon recruit high-ranking lieutenants for the Saints in Carlos, Pierce Washington and Shaundi. The player then officially becomes the new leader of the Saints and is then referred to as "the Boss" by the rest of the gang.

Maero, the leader of the Brotherhood, calls a meeting with Carlos and the Boss. The Brotherhood and The Saints's meeting is interrupted by cops. After escaping the police, they go back to The Brotherhood's headquarters. Aware that the Saints have very little influence left, he offers to give them 20% of Stilwater while The Brotherhood gets 80%. Insulted, the Saints refuse and declare war on the Brotherhood. With the help of Donnie, a former Westside Rollerz member who now works as Maero's head mechanic, the Boss blows up several of the Brotherhood's prize trucks and laces Maero's private supply of tattoo ink with toxic waste, leaving him with severe facial burns. As revenge, the Brotherhood kidnaps Carlos and drags him through the streets tied to a moving vehicle. With his injuries too severe for medical treatment, Carlos begs for the Boss to put him out of his misery, which the Boss sadly does so by shooting Carlos in the head while holding his hand. Furious at Maero for causing Carlos's death, the Saints abduct his girlfriend Jessica at a bank and lock her in the trunk of a car which is then destroyed by Maero during a Brotherhood-sponsored demolition derby, crushing her to death. With most of his remaining allies locked up, an enraged Maero forces Ultor CEO Dane Vogel to pressure Troy Bradshaw to release them. However, The Boss blows up the prison buses and prison boats before they reach their destination. Vogel orders his company's security forces to confiscate a Brotherhood weapons shipment as "compensation", but the Saints steal it first. Using the stolen weapons, the gang lays waste to the Brotherhood's dockside headquarters. While there, The Boss kills Matt, Maero's personal tattoo artist, for helping Maero escape. Maero calls the Boss to the Ultor Dome, where he and his surviving thugs plan to kill him/her in a demolition derby. The Boss then kills them before confronting the dying Maero. Before Maero can finish his last words, the Boss shoots him in the head, killing him and putting an end to the Brotherhood.

Working alongside Shaundi, the Boss moves to take down The Sons Of Samedi by killing their dealers and destroying their drug farms and labs. DJ Veteran Child, Shaundi's ex-boyfriend and a Sons Of Samedi lieutenant, has her kidnapped and brought to his club, where the Boss confronts and kills him. The General, the founder of The Sons of Samedi, arranges for the Boss to be drugged while his men assault the Saints at their base. Despite being severely intoxicated, the Boss rallies the Saints to fight off the attackers. Mr. Sunshine, the creator of the gang's product, is killed by the Boss whilst attempting to defend his manufacturing plant from a Saints raid. Unable to locate the General, Shaundi and the Boss pose as repair workers and hack the police station's street surveillance cameras to find him. Finally, the Saints organize an ambush of the General's motorcade, eventually tracking down and killing the General in the Stilwater Mall.

To get the Ronin's attention, Pierce, Gat, and the Boss rob their most profitable casino. Fearing disgrace, their leader, Shogo Akuji, orders his enforcer Jyunichi to use Aisha to lure Gat into a trap, which results in Aisha being decapitated and Gat getting severely wounded after losing a katana duel with Jyunichi. After killing Jyunichi in a fight at a restaurant and saving Johnny from Ronin hitmen trying to kill him at the hospital, the Boss receives the location of the Ronin's headquarters from Vogel, angered by Shogo's father, Kazuo, cutting all business ties with Ultor. As a last-ditch effort, Shogo leads a group of Ronin to kill Gat at Aisha's funeral. However, Gat and the Boss kill Shogo's men and bury him alive in a coffin as revenge for Aisha's murder. Kazuo, after surviving an attempt on his life at Wardill Airport, orders a direct attack on The Saints, but fails. Mr. Wong, an old ally of the Boss, is subjected to another attack at his heritage festival in a bid to lure The Saints out. After rescuing Mr. Wong, the Boss beats Kazuo in a sword fight and leaves him to die on a burning boat.

Meanwhile, an increasingly power-hungry Vogel plans to destroy the Saints so he can expand Ultor's control over all of Stilwater. When an initial effort to kill The Saints' leadership is foiled by The Boss, the Saints respond by destroying a high-security Ultor lab. The company's board of directors try to rein in Vogel, so he sends their locations to the Boss, which he uses to kill them. Appointing himself chairman, Vogel hosts a press conference to denounce the Saints. Gat and The Boss open fire on the conference, forcing Vogel to retreat into his office. Destroying the building's defenses, the Boss enters and confronts Vogel. Vogel attempts to fool the Boss by claiming the board of directors were behind the attacks, and tries to make a truce with the Boss by saying that they could unite their resources to control the city, but before Vogel manages to finish his sentence, the Boss shoots him in the mouth, sending Vogel flying off the window to his death in the streets below.

After conquering Stilwater, the Boss has the option of visiting Stilwater Police Headquarters and listening to 3 [[Telephone tapping|wiretap conversations]] recorded under Bradshaw's authority. According to the recordings, Julius was responsible for planting the bomb on Alderman Hughes' yacht that nearly killed the Boss, believing that doing so would allow him to disband the Saints and retire. The Boss can also contact Dex by phone, in which he offers to set up a meeting at The Saints' old base to discuss turning over Julius. If the player does so, however, Julius appears there instead and it becomes clear that Dex plans to have both of them killed on Ultor's behalf. After Julius and the Boss fight the Ultor Masako units across Stilwater in a car chase, the Boss shoots him in an abandoned amphitheater. Still not forgiving Julius for his betrayal, the Boss becomes adamant to kill him. Julius states that the Saints weren't able to change anything, as they had become no better than the gangs that they had been fighting against. The Boss proclaims that Julius's betrayal did help him with one thing: learning to never act as someone's pawn again and being in charge was the better choice. Despite Julius remarking that the Boss would've died if it weren't for him (mentioning the beginning cutscene of the first game), and saying that they were now even, the Boss shows him no mercy and kills him with a headshot, while remarking "''not really''".

== Development ==

[[Volition (company)|Volition]] began work on ''Saints Row 2'' in 2005, about a year before ''Saints Row'' was released.&lt;ref name="wp interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ge interview"/&gt; The sequel was first announced by [[THQ]]'s CEO Brian Farrell in a February 2007 conference call, alongside another six franchise continuations for the 2008 fiscal year.&lt;ref name="Auto97-22" /&gt; Game details began to surface in May 2008 after the first teaser trailer was released and sites like [[IGN]] and ''[[GameSpot]]'' reported on an early version of the game.&lt;ref name="Auto97-24" /&gt;

One of the development team's core goals was to develop an identity for the ''Saints Row'' franchise within the open world genre.&lt;ref name="behind scenes" /&gt; The series was known as a "[[Grand Theft Auto clone|''Grand Theft Auto'' clone]]" based on its first release's similarities to the open world sandbox game ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]''.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Volition"/&gt; Accordingly, ''Saints Row 2'' was compared to the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]] ''series' own upcoming sequel, ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]''.&lt;ref name="Auto97-31" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-32" /&gt; When questioned about the two sequels' close release dates, lead producer Greg Donovan responded that they thought their game could compete, that he saw the ''Grand Theft Auto'' sequel moving "in a more realistic direction",&lt;ref name="Auto97-33" /&gt; and that there was "room for more than just one game" in the open world genre as "a very different experience than what ... other games are looking to do".&lt;ref name="donovan" /&gt; The team took an "over-the-top" design approach, with cartoonish pastiche and "wild and outrageous" gameplay.&lt;ref name="afterthoughts" /&gt; Many early game elements were considered too crass to be included in the final release.&lt;ref name="afterthoughts" /&gt;

Many of the original ''Saints Row'' developers continued onto the sequel's team. Thus, the team worked from their lessons learned rather than starting anew. The two games were consequently similar in design.&lt;ref name="q&amp;a feature" /&gt; They overhauled the game engine to enhance the sequel's graphics,&lt;ref name="sr2qa" /&gt; and added contrast and higher-quality textures to make the city setting of Stilwater more realistic.&lt;ref name="tera preview" /&gt; Visual enhancements were also applied to people, cars, explosions, lighting, shadows, and the weather system.&lt;ref name="sr2qa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tera preview" /&gt; A central design goal was to "create a world that exists independent of the player" that featured more realistic [[non-player character]]s (NPCs)&lt;ref name="Auto97-30" /&gt; that would smoke cigarettes, use cellphones, drink coffee, open umbrellas when it rained, and physically interact. The original game's engine could not support proximity NPC interaction like sitting together or cuddling.&lt;ref name="lifedev" /&gt; As the city design finalized late in development, the team laboriously hand-placed 20,000 nodes throughout the game world that trigger NPC actions.&lt;ref name="lifedev" /&gt;

The ''Saints Row ''series narrative was conceived as a three-part story, with ''Saints Row 2'' as the second of the three.&lt;ref name="sr3interview" /&gt; While the developers continued the story of the original game, they sought to accommodate newcomers to the series.&lt;ref name="wp interview" /&gt; The final script had roughly 80,000 lines of dialogue, twice that of ''Saints Row''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s.&lt;ref name="lifedev" /&gt; The story drew strong cinematic influence from [[Quentin Tarantino]] films ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''&lt;ref name="sr2qa" /&gt; and ''[[Kill Bill]]''.&lt;ref name="sr2story" /&gt; While the script was written to follow "a path of betrayal, revenge and redemption", the game retains ''Saints Row''{{'}}s light humor,&lt;ref name="sr2story-gamespot" /&gt; with the "over-the-top, socially distorted" narrative juxtaposed with dark, gritty moments.&lt;ref name="sr2story" /&gt; ''Saints Row''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s silent protagonist speaks in ''Saints Row 2'', granting the protagonist more personality and improving the storytelling, according to James Tsai, one of the lead designers.&lt;ref name="sr2story" /&gt; They sought to heavily stylize the game's characters and assign them unique personality traits.&lt;ref name="msxbox interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wp interview" /&gt; The basic character designs followed naturally from the story Volition wanted to tell, but the characters' personalities and mannerisms were mainly a product of the voice acting performances, where the actors had freedom to interpret and develop their characters.&lt;ref name="wp interview" /&gt; The game's voice actors include film and television stars such as [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Michael Dorn]], [[Jay Mohr]], [[Keith David]], and [[Eliza Dushku]].&lt;ref name="Auto97-34" /&gt;

While the first game was released as an [[Xbox 360]] exclusive, Volition expanded the sequel's initial development to the [[PlayStation 3]] platform.&lt;ref name="ps3ign" /&gt; The platform was successful in Europe, where Volition wished to expand. The [[Video game porting|port]] was developed in-house by a team that previously worked on Xbox 360 development. They struggled with the PlayStation 3's [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell]] architecture.&lt;ref name="Auto97-21" /&gt; The game was particularly unstable during development, and would crash after several hours of play.&lt;ref name="behind scenes" /&gt; Lead producer Greg Donovan blamed their "failing to take systems and features to completion" as programmers fought last-minute bugs, artists lacked time to finalize designs, and consequently, [[playtest]] versions were not ready until late in the development cycle.&lt;ref name="behind scenes" /&gt;&lt;nowiki /&gt;&lt;nowiki /&gt;&lt;nowiki /&gt;&lt;nowiki /&gt;&lt;nowiki /&gt;&lt;nowiki /&gt;&lt;nowiki /&gt;

=== Soundtrack and audio ===

The game's soundtrack features about 170 licensed tracks accessible across twelve in-game radio stations while driving or at home. Station genres include [[alternative rock]], [[reggae]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] and [[1980s in music|1980s pop]], with artists such as [[Opeth]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], [[The Used]], [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Avenged Sevenfold]], [[Paramore]], [[Panic! at the Disco]] and [[Run-D.M.C.]]&lt;ref name="ign music" /&gt;&lt;ref name="music revealed" /&gt; The player can create a custom playlist of the licensed tracks to play on a separate station.&lt;ref name="music revealed" /&gt; Lead audio designer Frank Petreikis's budget for licensed music was double that of the previous game so as to secure more prominent tracks.&lt;ref name="Auto97-35"/&gt;

Volition extended the game's over-the-top atmosphere and humor into the radio stations via [[radio advertisements|commercials]].&lt;ref name="q&amp;a feature" /&gt; For example, commercials that promoted Ultor Corporation products served to enhance the player's sense of the corporation's omnipresence in Stilwater.&lt;ref name="pump up the volume"/&gt; The radio commercials were recorded with voice actors in the same room, rather than apart, so as to maximize their group dynamism.&lt;ref name="pump up the volume"/&gt; Many of the in-game commercials went through several drafts and the developers found this writing process to be challenging.&lt;ref name="pump up the volume"/&gt;

== Marketing ==

Prior to its release, ''Saints Row 2'' was heavily marketed and promoted through Internet and television trailers. Volition also ran several fat contests with series-related paraphernalia as prizes. The game's original release date was delayed for marketing considerations.&lt;ref name="anniello"/&gt; The game's first trailer, in March 2008, was presented as a tourism promotion about the Ultor Corporation's role in rebuilding Stilwater.&lt;ref name="Auto97-36" /&gt; A full marketing campaign featuring American [[film actor]] [[Gary Busey]] began the next month.&lt;ref name="Auto97-37" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-38" /&gt; The ''Street Lessons with Uncle Gary'' video series demonstrated particular aspects of gameplay.&lt;ref name="Auto97-39" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-41" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-42" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-43" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-48" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-49" /&gt; Subsequent trailers over the next several months also highlighted gameplay elements,&lt;ref name="Auto97-44" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-45" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-46" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-47" /&gt; but one made light of ''Grand Theft Auto IV''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s lack of [[replay value]],&lt;ref name="would you rather" /&gt; and another demonstrated the cooperative mode using characters modeled on the candidates from the [[2008 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref name="Auto97-65" /&gt; A redesigned official website and community network was launched in July 2008,&lt;ref name="Auto97-27" /&gt; and American [[pornographic actor|pornographic actress]] [[Tera Patrick]] was featured in her own marketing campaign for the game.&lt;ref name="tera preview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-50" /&gt;

Promotional contests throughout mid-2008 included "Pimp Your Crib"&lt;ref name="Auto97-69" /&gt; and "Summer of Bling".&lt;ref name="Auto97-70" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-71" /&gt; Another competition from THQ and ''WorthPlaying'' gave the winner a trip to a San Francisco ''Saints Row 2'' multiplayer event and published their thoughts online.&lt;ref name="Auto97-72" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-73" /&gt; British fashion label Joystick Junkies ran a [[T-shirt]] design competition in September 2008, and the top entry was featured in the game's first downloadable content pack.&lt;ref name="Auto97-74" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dlc 1 items" /&gt; Another round of "Summer of Bling" awarded the shirts as prizes.&lt;ref name="Auto97-75" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-76" /&gt; The "Trick Your Pack" tool launched in September let the player create their own game box art.&lt;ref name="Auto97-77" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-78" /&gt; There were also other promotions and give-aways.&lt;ref name="Auto97-80" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-81" /&gt; At conventions, ''Saints Row 2'' appeared at the 2008 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]], [[THQ]] Gamer's Day, [[Comic-Con International|Comic Con]],&lt;ref name="Auto97-82" /&gt; [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX]], [[GameStop]] Expo,&lt;ref name="Auto97-83" /&gt; and [[Games Convention|Leipzig Games Conventions]]. The game also promoted itself in the [[Myspace]] Music Tour&lt;ref name="Auto97-84" /&gt; and [[Movember|November 2008]], an Australian fundraiser for men's health.&lt;ref name="Auto97-85" /&gt; In November, THQ signed a deal with [[Massive Incorporated]] to include in-game advertisements on their Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 products.&lt;ref name="Auto97-86" /&gt; In-game and online, players can also find movie posters throughout the city that promote upcoming releases.&lt;ref name="Auto97-87" /&gt;

== Release ==

The game was originally scheduled for release in North America on August 26, 2008,&lt;ref name="Auto97-25" /&gt; but was delayed to October 14&lt;ref name="pushback" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-26" /&gt; both to add final touches and to launch in a more advantageous release window.&lt;ref name="anniello" /&gt; The game released in three different "Collectors Editions", each with a copy of the game, a poster, a limited edition art book, and several extras. The ''Saints Row 2'' "Initiation Pack", exclusive to Australia and New Zealand, included promotional items such as a pizza box and bullet-shaped [[USB flash drive|USB memory stick]].&lt;ref name="Auto97-88" /&gt; The Russia-exclusive "Gift - Buka Edition" also included the bullet-shaped USB stick,&lt;ref name="Auto97-91" /&gt; and the "Gun Pack" included a gun-shaped USB stick.&lt;ref name="Auto97-89" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-90" /&gt; A month before the game's release, ''Saints Row 2'' producer Dan Sutton stated in an interview that they "definitely" planned to make downloadable content.&lt;ref name="sr2 dlc"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://play.tm/interview/21547/dan-sutton-on-saints-row-2/ | title= Saints Row 3 Already in Development | author= Luke Guttridge | accessdate= September 28, 2008 | publisher= Play.tm | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080928090330/http://play.tm/interview/21547/dan-sutton-on-saints-row-2/ | archivedate= September 28, 2008 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 releases of the game received "generally favorable" reviews, according to video game [[review score aggregator]] [[Metacritic]], and the Windows release received "mixed or average" reviews.&lt;ref name="Metacritic: PS3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Metacritic: 360"/&gt;

[[Ben Croshaw|Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]] of ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''{{'s}} ''[[Zero Punctuation]]'' named ''Saints Row 2'' his 2008 [[game of the year]].&lt;ref name="Kotaku: 2008 GOTYs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zero Punctuation award"/&gt; It was a runner up for [[GameShark]]'s overall and Xbox 360 games of the year.&lt;ref name="GameShark GOTY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameShark GOTY X360"/&gt; ''[[Game Developer (magazine)|Game Developer]]'' named Volition in their top 50 developers of the year for their work on the game,&lt;ref name="GDM: 2009 JuneJuly"/&gt; and THQ in their top 20 publishers.&lt;ref name="GDM: 2009 Oct"/&gt;

The console version of ''Saints Row 2'' garnered generally positive reviews. The PC version was relatively less well received due to frame rate issues and visual pop-in. [[1UP.com]] gave the game a B, stating that it "relishes the hedonistic aspects of the open-world genre", that it has "plenty of innovation" and that the "excellence in the presentation makes the world of Saints [Row] 2 a great introduction for newcomers to open world games".&lt;ref name="1up review" /&gt;

[[Eurogamer]] gave the game a 9/10, stating that it "is one of the most ridiculous and enjoyable games of the year".&lt;ref name="eurog review"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' gave the game an 8.75/10, stating that "in its own silly, b-movie way, it's a damn fun game" and a "profately good time".&lt;ref name="gi review"/&gt; [[GameSpot]] gave the game an 8.0/10, stating that "from beginning to end, this is one of the most fun urban chaos games out there" and that it will "keep you happily creating havoc for a long time".&lt;ref name="gspot review"/&gt; [[GameSpy]] gave the game four and a half stars out of five, stating that it "offers up a shooting and driving experience that is plenty of fun" and that it is "self-consciously funny in its irreverence" and "will definitely appeal to much of its audience".&lt;ref name="gspy review"/&gt;

[[IGN]] U.S. gave the game an 8.2/10, stating that "the core gameplay experience is extremely enjoyable".&lt;ref name="ign-us review"/&gt; IGN AU gave the game an 8/10, stating that it is "big, dumb fun".&lt;ref name="ign-au review"/&gt; IGN UK gave the game a 7.5/10, stating that it "demonstrates that there is still plenty of mileage to be eked out of open-world games" and that "there's certainly enough here to keep any fans of sandbox violence entertained".&lt;ref name="ign-uk review"/&gt;

Among positive acclaim, some publishers gave the game generally negative reviews. UK magazine ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' gave the game a 5/10, stating that "few of the game's details will stick in your mind for long, and its pranky focus means it rarely gives you anything interesting to do with the toys on offer".&lt;ref name="Auto97-117"/&gt;

[[Entertainment Weekly]] flagged the game as "racist, misogynistic, crude, cynical, humorless and stupid" and labelled it the worst game of 2008,&lt;ref name="Auto97-119"/&gt; despite previously giving the game a B and calling it "a larcenous good time".&lt;ref name="Auto97-120"/&gt;

The game did not gain a favourable response from New York City officials and police. City spokespersons requested that the game be pulled from shelves upon its release; [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] [[trade union|union]] boss Patrick Lynch criticized the game, stating that "these horrible and violent video games desensitize young people to violence while encouraging depravity, immorality while glorifying criminal behavior".&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt;

[[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]], a former lawyer and longtime critic of violent video games, called ''Saints Row 2'' a "[[Grand Theft Auto clone|''Grand Theft Auto'' ripoff]]", and said that "as is true with pornography, as is true with violence, the subsequent products tend to push the envelope even more".&lt;ref name="ny daily"/&gt; On Tuesday, October 14, 2008, the game's US release date, candidate [[Leslie Crocker Snyder]] and others spoke out against the game, surrounded by police union members who support her bid.&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt;

[[David Paterson|Governor David Paterson]] signed a bill in July 2008 requiring prominent display of age ratings on video games and mandating parental control on game consoles by 2010.&lt;ref name="ny daily"/&gt;

===Sales===
''Saints Row 2'' sold approximately 365,000 copies in its first month, outselling ''[[Dead Space (video game)|Dead Space]]'', which was released the same day.&lt;ref name="Auto97-121"/&gt; The Xbox 360 version comprised the majority of these sales.&lt;ref name="Auto97-122"/&gt; The game shipped over two million units by the end of 2008.&lt;ref name="Auto97-123"/&gt; Still, analyst Doug Creutz reported that the game's sales to this point were well below expectations.&lt;ref name="creutz report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-124"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-125"/&gt; Following ''Saints Row 2''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s January 2009 Windows release, the game had shipped over 2.6 million copies by the next month.&lt;ref name="Auto97-126"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-127"/&gt; In May 2009, THQ reported a $431 million loss in revenue, but ''Saints Row 2'' sales totaled 2.8 million.&lt;ref name="Auto97-128"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto97-129"/&gt; Combined with the original release, the series had worldwide sales in excess of six million, making it one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchises]].&lt;ref name="Auto97-130"/&gt;&lt;nowiki /&gt;

As of September 2010, ''Saints Row 2'' has sold over 6.5 million units worldwide.&lt;ref name="Auto97-132"/&gt; The game's success led THQ to shift its focus to large franchises.&lt;ref name="GDM: 2009 Oct"/&gt;

}}
'''''Seder-Masochism''''' is a 2018 American [[animation|animated]] [[musical film|musical]] [[comedy-drama]] film written, directed, produced and animated by American artist [[Nina Paley]]. The film reinterprets [[Hebrew Bible]] events from the ''[[Book of Exodus]]'', especially stories associated with the [[Passover Seder]], such as the [[Plagues of Egypt|death of the Egyptian first-born]], and [[Moses]] leading the [[Israelites]] out of slavery in Egypt. The film depicts these events against a backdrop of widespread worship of the [[Mother goddess|Great Mother Goddess]], showing the rise of patriarchy.

''Seder-Masochim'' is Paley's second feature film, following ''[[Sita Sings the Blues]]'' in 2008, an animated film loosely based on the ''[[Ramayana]]''. In a similar fashion to her previous work, Paley mainly uses previously published music in ''Seder-Masochism'', with popular and liturgical songs ranging from 1928 to 2018. She also draws from spoken voice recordings she made in 2011 with her father, Hiram Paley, who is placed in the role of the traditional Hebrew deity. Greg Sextro served as [[sound designer]] on the film.&lt;ref name=Credits&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sedermasochism.com/credits/ |title=Credits |work=Seder-Masochism |author=Nina Paley |access-date=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Theodore Gray]], Paley formed PaleGray Labs to create a method for animating [[embroidery]], which they call "embroidermation". In ''Seder-Masochism'', embroidered animation is the basis for one scene: "Chad Gadya". 

Debuting in the 2018 film festival season, ''Seder-Masochism'' was reviewed positively, with Paley's bright and satirical style compared to [[Monty Python]] and others. The film earned the Audience Award at the [[ANIMATOR (festival)|ANIMATOR]] film festival in [[Poland]].

==Plot==
[[File:Moses Hebrews Promised Land by Nina Paley.jpg|thumb|left|After the [[crossing of the Red Sea]], Moses and Aharon lead the Israelites into the [[Promised Land]]]]
The ''[[Book of Exodus]]'' is retold by [[Moses]], his brother [[Aaron|Aharon]], the [[Destroying angel (Bible)|Angel of Death]], [[Jesus]], and the traditional [[Yahweh|Hebrew God]]. The ancient [[mother goddess]] is cast in a "tragic struggle" against the new patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sedermasochism.com/2018/04/12/synopsis/ |title=Synopsis |date=April 12, 2018 |author=Nina Paley |work=Seder-Masochism: A new animated feature from the creator of Sita Sings the Blues |access-date=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
After ''Sita Sings the Blues'', Paley was criticized by some observers for co-opting the [[culture of India]] as an outsider, an assertion with which she strongly disagreed. A recurring theme among the negative comments was "how would you like it if people made a film about your religion?"&lt;ref name=Variety/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fr.globalvoices.org/2018/02/06/221044/ |title=Dans son film ‘Seder-Masochism’ Nina Paley éclaire la naissance du patriarcat dans le Livre de l'Exode en animant des idoles antiques |language=French |author1=Subhashish Panigrahi |author2=Qurratulain (Annie) Zaman |translator=Suzanne Lehn |date=February 6, 2018 |publisher=[[Global Voices (NGO)|Global Voices]] |access-date=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paley thought that she would enjoy watching any such film. Accepting this as a challenge, she turned to her own [[Jewish culture|Jewish cultural heritage]] for her next project: a revisionist retelling of the story of [[Passover]]. She pored over the Book of Exodus, finding details that were not part of modern Jewish culture, for instance that Moses's brother Aharon performed some of the acts that are commonly attributed to Moses, and that the Jews were killing each other during their 40 years "wandering" in the desert.&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA |title=Nina Paley: Animator Extraordinaire |author=[[Jordan Peterson|Jordan B Peterson]] |date=July 14, 2018 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For inspiration, she also read ''The Creation of Patriarchy'' by [[Gerda Lerner]], and ''The Language of the Goddess'' by [[Marija Gimbutas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/seder-masochism-why-film-different-all-other-films |title=‘Seder-Masochism’: Why Is This Film Different from All Other Films? |author=Sharon Katz |date=June 14, 2018 |work=Animation World Network |access-date=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She concluded that the Book of Exodus represents the final defeat of goddess worship by the [[patriarchy]] that had been rising since the [[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://inliquid.org/calendar/seder-masochism-female-deicide-in-the-book-of-exodus-lecture/ |title=Seder-Masochism: Female Deicide in the Book of Exodus |date=September 8, 2017 |author=Nina Paley |work=InLiquid Calendar |accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:God Dollar by Nina Paley.jpg|thumb|Hiram Paley provides the voice of God, represented here on the [[United States dollar|US dollar]], in conversation with his daughter [[Nina Paley]], depicted as the sacrificial goat]]
In 2011, Paley interviewed her terminally ill father, Hiram, intending that his voice would serve as the old bearded god figure of the Israelites. For herself, she chose to play the part of a sacrificial goat, because [[animal sacrifice]] was essential to many early religions, and because she has been seen as the [[black sheep]] of her family.&lt;ref name=Variety&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/festivals/annecy-seder-masochism-nina-paley-1202839427/ |title=Annecy: 'Seder-Masochism' Director Nina Paley: 'I Have No Idea How This Movie Will Go Into the World' |author=Ben Croll |date=June 10, 2018 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiram Paley died in 2012 at the age of 78.&lt;ref name=Credits/&gt; Even though her father was a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Atheism|atheist]], the Paley family had celebrated Passover every year so that the children would know their cultural identity. Paley, also a Jewish atheist, weaves the voice recordings of her father into the film as a way to understand the Passover story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nycreligion.info/moses-exodus-makeover-animator-nina-paley-grooving/ |title=Moses make-over by animator Nina Paley will have you grooving |author=Pauline Dolle |date=April 3, 2018 |work=A Journey Through NYC Religions |access-date=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Paley initiated a [[Kickstarter]] crowd-funding effort to raise money for "Phase I" of the film, with a goal of $3,600. The campaign brought in $4,146.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1850676295/seder-masochism-phase-i |title=Seder Masochism: Phase I |author=Nina Paley |date=September 8, 2011 |publisher=[[Kickstarter]] |accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of Phase I was to make recordings of various family Passover Seder discussions. Ultimately, the project took another direction, and the recordings were not used in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nina Paley |title=Who is Producer X? |url=http://blog.ninapaley.com/2018/04/25/who-is-producer-x/ |date=April 25, 2018 |work=Nina Paley Blog |access-date=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paley worked on the project over the course of six years, spending about three-and-a-half years animating and producing it. First, she animated some musical numbers – "This Land Is Mine" and "Moses-Exodus" – using [[Adobe_Flash#Macromedia|Macromedia Flash 8]] running on a first-generation [[Mac Pro]] tower, but this was not powerful enough to edit [[4K resolution]] video in a practical manner. In 2013, she shifted the project to a second-generation Mac Pro, the vertical cylinder model, and settled on the applicaton [[Moho (Anime Studio)|Anime Studio Pro]].&lt;ref name=10Questions/&gt; Paley initially found the Anime Studio Pro interface to be frustratingly complex, so she hosted Chilean animator Victor Paredes at her workspace for a week in 2014 to better learn the software. In 2016, Anime Studio Pro became Moho Pro, with an upgraded version. Paley said that it was not until 2017 that she could express herself easily in Moho Pro.&lt;ref name="Dancing Goddesses"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/dancing-goddesses-how-nina-paley-animated-stone-sculptures-seder-masochism |title=Dancing Goddesses: How Nina Paley Animated Stone Sculptures for ‘Seder-Masochism’ |author=Jennifer Wolfe |date=August 23, 2018 |work=Animation World Network |access-date=August 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Paley wrote that much of the project had been completed without a "coherent story", despite the attempt to tie it together in the loose form of a Passover Seder. She decided instead "to articulate the Exodus from the Goddesses' point of view", the goddesses who were at that time worshiped in Egypt as [[Hathor]], [[Isis]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Sekhmet]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nina Paley |title=Seder-Masochism Progress Report |url=http://blog.ninapaley.com/2017/11/29/5221/ |date=November 29, 2017 |work=Nina Paley Blog |access-date=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This turned her film into a narrative "about patriarchy and the suppression of the Goddess".&lt;ref name=10Questions/&gt;

After showing rough cuts of the new concept to friends, Paley decided to bring more goddess images into the film. In late 2017/early 2018, she imported high resolution photos of ancient goddess figurines into the graphics editor [[GIMP]] to remove backgrounds, then she exported the resulting [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG files]] to Moho. In Moho, Paley assigned "little skeleton" points on the images to establish how the goddess figurines could bend, and she created additional layers for smaller movements such as eye blinks and smiling/frowning. She offered these individual goddess animations for free on her blog.&lt;ref name="Dancing Goddesses"/&gt; Among the goddess figurines appearing in the film are the [[Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük]] (6,000 BC, Turkey), the [[Venus of Willendorf]] (30,000 BC, Austria), and the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]] (35,000 BC, Germany).&lt;ref name=ZippyFrames&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zippyframes.com/index.php/reviews/seder-masochism-review |author=Vassilis Kroustallis |title=Seder-Masochism Review: Let's Dance  |date=June 13, 2018 |work=Zippy Frames |access-date=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final assembly and editing of the film was performed on [[Final Cut Pro X]], which Paley said was "horrible" in its interface but powerful in its processing of 4K video: 3840×2160 pixels.&lt;ref name="Dancing Goddesses"/&gt; In all, Paley estimated the film's final budget at $20,000.&lt;ref name=10Questions/&gt;

===Embroidery animation===
Paley teamed with science writer and programmer [[Theodore Gray]] to develop "embroidermation": an automated method of animating [[embroidery]]. In 2015 after working for a year and a half, the PaleGray Labs team produced a Passover-themed animated short, "Chad Gadya", intended to serve as [[intermission]] for ''Seder-Masochism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.awn.com/news/watch-intricate-embroidery-comes-life-chad-gadya |title=Watch: Intricate Embroidery Comes to Life in 'Chad Gadya'  |author=Jeremy Monsayac |date=July 14, 2015 |work=Animation World Network |access-date=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paley created animated figures in Macromedia Flash 8, then Gray imported the resulting vector files into [[Wolfram Mathematica]], a powerful visualization program which he co-created. The figures were rendered as polygons in Mathematica, then a custom application was written to properly align the embroidery stitch direction, different for each polygon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.theodoregray.com/stitchblog/2015/7/10/embroidered-animation-finally |title=Embroidered Animation! Finally! |date=July 10, 2015 |author=[[Theodore Gray]] |work=Stitchblog |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using an embroidery machine, a total of 516 embroidered figures was stitched into 86 matzoh covers (decorative cloths for holding [[Matzo|matzoh]] during Passover), then each completed figure was photographed to create one frame of animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/laborious-embroidery-animation-brings-passover-folk-song-life-180956256/ |title=This Animation Is Made of Embroidery |author=Marissa Fessenden |date=August 12, 2015 |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Chad Gadya" scene runs just under 3 minutes, accompanied by the childrens' Passover song, "[[Chad Gadya]]", sung by [[Moishe Oysher]] and recorded in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/133054221 "Chad Gadya" video] on Vimeo&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Following the June 2018 showing at [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]], the ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that the film was "completely irreverent, occasionally hilarious and politically evocative", and that it "defies definition" with its different aspects of [[Musical theatre|musical comedy]], psychedelic cartoon, and "insolent" religious epic. Paley is observed to have "lots of fun" turning Bible events "into [[Busby Berkeley]]-style song-and-dance numbers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/seder-masochism-review-1120073 |title='Seder-Masochism': Film Review &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; Annecy 2018 |author=Jordan Mintzer |date=June 14, 2018 |magazine=[[Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain's [[El Mundo (Spain)|''El Mundo'']] newspaper compared the film's irony and apparent naïveté to works by the [[Marx Brothers]], Italian playwright [[Dario Fo]], and [[Monty Python]], writing that Paley applies unprejudiced and sharp commentary to the Jewish story while remaining bright and ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/cine/2018/06/14/5b222e9ce5fdea49598b45ba.html |author=Luis Martinez |title=El patriarcado desacralizado y otros milagros de la animación radical en Annecy |language=Spanish |date=June 14, 2018 |work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; French film website ''Courte-Focale'' compared ''Seder-Masochism'' to ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'', writing that Paley brought a "fiercely humorous" spirit to the task of attacking patriarchal religion, an attack carried out with "acuteness and precision" in a way that disarms her opponents and yields a hilarious result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courte-focale.fr/cinema/festivals/annecy-2018/annecy-seder-masochism/ |title=Annecy 2018 &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; Wall / Seder-Masochism |author=Matthieu Ruard |date=June 2018 |work=Courte-Focale |language=French |access-date=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek animator Vassilis Kroustallis said that Paley's second film "is another bold attempt... to associate the catastrophe that religion may bring with the male ego." He wrote that the musical choreography is good but the editing suffers from the juxtaposition of different scenes.&lt;ref name=ZippyFrames/&gt;

In [[Poznań]], Poland, at the [[ANIMATOR (festival)|ANIMATOR]] film festival, ''Seder-Masochism'' earned the Audience Award for Feature Film.&lt;ref name=ANIMATOR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animator-festival.com/en/posts/here-are-the-winners--2 |title=Here Are the Winners |date=July 12, 2018 |publisher=[[ANIMATOR (festival)|ANIMATOR festival]] |access-date=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Paley spent $70,000 to secure the music rights to ''Sita Sings the Blues'', just to distribute it freely, so for ''Seder-Masochism'' she turned to the [[Fair use#Parody|parody defense in fair use]]: a parody of a copyrighted work can be considered fair use.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt; As a result, she did not try to secure the rights to the many recordings she used in the film. She told ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that anyone who is interested can perform the legal work to clear the music rights, after which that person or corporation will be able to distribute the film commercially, or license it for distribution.&lt;ref name=Variety/&gt;

The song "This Land Is Mine" came first in Paley's production process; she used it to frame a scene in which a succession of warring men claims the [[Holy Land]] as theirs. The music is the main theme of the 1960 film [[Exodus (1960 film)|''Exodus'']], composed by Austrian [[Ernest Gold (composer)|Ernest Gold]], with words added later by [[Pat Boone]], which he sang and released as a single titled "The Exodus Song". Boone, an American Christian, said he wrote the lyrics in 25 minutes on Christmas Eve, on the back of a Christmas card, which he later sent to [[Yad Vashem]], the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=44569 |title=The Exodus Song (This Land Is Mine) by Pat Boone |work=SongFacts.com |access-date=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The version Paley used in ''Seder-Masochism'' is a cover by Boone's friend [[Andy Williams]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-pat-boone-remembers-andy-williams-1.5194425 |title=Pat Boone Remembers 'Exodus' Song Partner Andy Williams |date=October 24, 2012 |author=Mordechai I. Twersky |newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; released in 1962 under the title "The Exodus Song (This Land Is Mine)", as part of his album ''[[Moon River and Other Great Movie Themes]]'', the album reaching number&amp;nbsp;3 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top 200]], selling more than two&amp;nbsp;million copies by 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yIEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT26 |page=26 |author=[[Clive Davis]] |title=Columbia's View: Market Potential |date=November 11, 1967 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] |issn=0006-2510}} [Special Issue titled ''A Billboard Spotlight: Andy Williams'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, the song became a [[Zionism|Zionist]] anthem. Paley parodies the song's Zionist theme to show the senselessness of war in the Middle East: the scene ends in atomic destruction, with nobody winning except the Angel of Death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://new-savanna.blogspot.com/2018/08/seder-masochism-beginning-and-end-last.html |title=Seder-Masochism: Nina Paley began at the end and ended at the beginning |author=Jordan Mintzer |date=August 2, 2018 |work=New Savanna |access-date=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paley commissioned a song for the film from New York-based rock musician Todd Michaelsen, who had earlier collaborated on a song for ''Sita Sings the Blues'', but Paley eventually decided not to use Michaelsen's song. She said that she prefers "songs that have a different original meaning", so that her animation adds a second meaning, yielding greater depth.&lt;ref name="Dancing Goddesses"/&gt;

For her dancing goddesses number, animated in early 2018, Paley chose a song from the 1976 film ''[[Car Wash (film)|Car Wash]]'': "You Gotta Believe", written by [[Norman Whitfield]] and performed by [[the Pointer Sisters]]. In ''Car Wash'', Paley said the song is used to "urge activist men to stand up for their activist sisters",&lt;ref name="Dancing Goddesses"/&gt; but in ''Seder-Masochism'' it is an ultimately unsuccessful plea to Moses to embrace goddess worship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/253135841 "You Gotta Believe" video] on Vimeo&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
A '''''sekitori''''' (関取) is a ''[[rikishi]]'' (sumo wrestler) who is ranked in one of the top two professional divisions: ''[[makuuchi]]'' and ''[[jūryō]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2018/09/16/sumo/sumo-101-sekitori/|title=Sumo 101: Sekitori|website=[[The Japan Times]]|first=John|last=Gunning|date=September 16, 2018|access-date=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name literally translates to having taken the barrier, as only a relatively small fraction of those who enter professional sumo achieve ''sekitori'' status.

Currently there are 70 ''rikishi'' in these divisions. The benefits of being a ''sekitori'' compared to lower ranked wrestlers are significant and include:
* to receive a salary and bonus (those in the lower divisions merely receive an allowance)
* to have one's own supporters' club
* to wear high quality men's [[kimono]] and other items of attire
* to have a private room in the [[Heya (sumo)|training stable]]
* to be able to get married and live away from the training stable
* to have junior ''rikishi'' to effectively act as their personal servants
* to wear a silk ''[[mawashi]]'' with stiffened cords (called ''sagari'') in tournament bouts 
* to participate in the ring entrance ceremony and wear a ''[[keshō-mawashi]]''
* to wear the more elaborate ''ōichō [[chonmage]]'' hairstyle in competition and on formal occasions
* to become an [[Toshiyori|elder]] in the [[Sumo Association]] if one is ''sekitori'' for long enough

==Memorabilia associated with ''sekitori''==
[[File:teraotegata.jpg|thumb|Tegata of the former ''makuuchi'' wrestler [[Terao Tsunefumi|Terao]]]]

The item of memorabilia most often associated with sumo wrestling is ''tegata'' (literally hand shape).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2018/09/15/sumo/sumo-101-tegata/|title=Sumo 101: Tegata|website=[[The Japan Times]]|first=John|last=Gunning|date=September 15, 2018|access-date=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only ''sekitori'' are allowed to make them for fans. They could be equated to the sumo version of an [[autograph]]. ''Tegata'' consist of a print of a wrestler's hand using black or red ink accompanied by his ring name written in calligraphic style by the wrestler himself. Original ''tegata'' are given out to fans and members of one's supporter club. Printed copies of ''tegata'' can also be bought inexpensively.

==Supporter clubs==
When a wrestler achieves ''sekitori'' status, he is allowed to have a fan/supporter club called a ''kōenkai'' if he has enough popularity. This is in addition to ''kōenkai'' associated with his sumo stable. These clubs often pool their money to buy the wrestler such items as his decorative apron called a ''[[Mawashi#Keshō-mawashi|keshō-mawashi]]''. For their support, supporter club members expect and receive access to the wrestlers and are given invitations to post-tournament parties and other events where they will have direct contact with them.

==Background==
Steve Rizzo is a native of [[Brooklyn]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=H&amp;R&gt;{{cite news |url=http://herald-review.com/news/local/community-leaders-breakfast-speaker-finds-success-in-laughter/article_b80f98f5-4684-5640-bc79-3406f2377c51.html |title=Community Leaders Breakfast speaker finds success in laughter |author=Mary Tallon |newspaper=''[[Herald &amp; Review]]'' |date=February 8, 2008 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TBB&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trailer-bodybuilders.com/mag/trucks_humor/ |title=How to be a Humor Being |author=Rick Weber |publisher=''[[Penton Media]]'' |magazine=''Trailer/Body Builders'' |date=March 1, 2002 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While growing up, "Rizzo was [once] told by a [high school] guidance counselor that he didn't have the intelligence for college." He went on to study at the [[Long Island University C. W. Post Campus]], earning a Bachelor of Arts in English and Education (with [[Honors student|Honors]]) and Master of Arts in Theater Arts.&lt;ref name=NSA-2/&gt;

==Career==
Rizzo was once an English teacher for the 7th and 8th grade students at [[Babylon (village), New York#Public Schools|West Babylon Junior High School]] in [[West Babylon, New York]], and counselor to students with behavioral problems in the 9th to 12th grades. He later became a comedian,&lt;ref name=PP&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YsgdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gGEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7103,673666&amp;dq=steve-rizzo+comedian&amp;hl=en |title=Night Life: Comedy, Jazz Reign In District Clubs |author=Lenny Litman |publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' |newspaper=''[[The Pittsburgh Press]]'' |page=25 |date=June 2, 1983 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SM&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wM8wAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Zt0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5903,5394952&amp;dq=steve-rizzo+comedian&amp;hl=en |title=Industrial Week |newspaper=''The [[Southeast Missourian]]'' |page=40 |date=September 28, 1997 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was roommate to [[Drew Carey]], had [[Dennis Miller]] and [[Rosie O'Donnell]] open shows for him and shared the stage with [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Ellen DeGeneres]] before moving on to become a motivational speaker.&lt;ref name=McGraw-Hill&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcgrawhill.ca/professional/media/business/get-your-shift-together/ |title=Get Your SHIFT Together |publisher=''[[McGraw-Hill]]'' |date=January 24, 2013 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rizzo left a promising career of over 18 years in stand-up comedy to pursue a new career in motivational speaking; he became a professional speaker in 1994.&lt;ref name=Speaker/&gt;

As a stand-up comic, Rizzo performed at various [[comedy club]]s, including the Pittsburgh Comedy Club in [[Dormont, Pennsylvania|Dormont]] and [[the Improv]].&lt;ref name=PP/&gt; He also was featured in many television comedy shows, including [[The Improv|An Evening at the Improv]], [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] [[Television special|Special]], [[The Comedy Channel (United States)|The Comedy Channel]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox TV's]] ''[[Comic Strip Live (TV series)|Comic Strip Live]]''.&lt;ref name=NSA-2/&gt;&lt;ref name=TBB/&gt; In ''[[The Pittsburgh Press]]'' of June 2, 1983, Lenny Litman described Rizzo's comedy style as "whip-cracking satire cushioned with warm and funny stories."&lt;ref name=PP/&gt;

While Rizzo was transitioning from being a stand-up comedian to a [[motivational speaking|motivational speaker]], after one of his shows at a New Jersey comedy club, he met Al Parinello, president of the [[National Speakers Association]] (NSA)—New Jersey chapter, he encouraged Rizzo to attend a workshop of the [[National Speakers Association]]. After the workshop, Rizzo was asked to present ''How to Add Humor to Your Presentations'' at a national convention of the [[National Speakers Association]]. At this transitioning period, Rizzo also met Nancy Lauterbach, the founder of Five Star Speakers and Trainers after a show in [[Orlando, Florida]], and according to Kelli Vrla in ''Speaker'' (a publication of [[National Speakers Association]]) of September 2010, "she took him under her wing and helped him structure his presentation. In his first showcase, Rizzo ranked dead last out of 23 speakers because he tried to sound like a "serious motivational speaker." He soon realized his humor was the key to his authenticity. "I was light years ahead of many professional speakers because I had command of an audience," Rizzo says. When Rizzo incorporated humor in his next showcase, buyers immediately hired him. He signed an exclusive agreement with Five Star, and his speaking business took off. Rizzo credits Lauterbach with helping him establish a foothold in his new career."&lt;ref name=Speaker/&gt;

Rizzo had a [[PBS]] [[Television special|Special]] which he created by himself, and he was also the executive producer.&lt;ref name=NSA-2/&gt; In an article published on December 08, 2006 by [[Oprah Radio]] (via [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah.com]]), [[Mehmet Oz]] wrote that "Steve Rizzo is the author of ''Becoming a Humor Being'', and the creator and executive producer of his own nationally syndicated PBS special. After doing stand-up comedy for many years, Steve transitioned to being a professional humorist speaker."&lt;ref name=Oprah&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahradio/Laughter-is-the-Best-Medicine |title=Laughter is the Best Medicine |author=Dr. Mehmet Oz |author-link=Mehmet Oz |publisher=[[Oprah Radio]] |via=[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah.com]] |date=December 8, 2006 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A publication by [[McGraw-Hill]] (introducing Rizzo's book, ''Get Your SHIFT Together: How to Think, Laugh, and Enjoy Your Way to Success in Business and in Life'') says, "[Rizzo reaches] well over 50,000 people a year through his talks and weekly Rizzo-Gram e-mails."&lt;ref name=McGraw-Hill/&gt;

==Affiliations==

While addressing the members of the association on ''How to be a Humor Being'', he described himself as a ''Professional Humor Being (PhB)''.&lt;ref name=TBB/&gt; Rizzo was also a speaker at [[International Sleep Products Association|ISPA]] EXPO 2006, where he "kept his [International Sleep Products Association] audience laughing while they learned how to deal with every-day stressors and embrace change in their lives during the ISPA Industry Breakfast."&lt;ref name=FW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://furninfo.com/Furniture%20Industry%20News%20Archive/6034 |title=ISPA Reports A Successful EXPO 2006 Show |publisher=''Furniture World Magazine'' |date=March 14, 2006 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the ''Community Leaders Breakfast'' at the Decatur Confenrence Center and Hotel in [[Decatur, Illinois]] in 2008, "Rizzo spoke of the benefits of unleashing your "humor being" as a way to bring out the best in yourself during trying times."&lt;ref name=H&amp;R/&gt; Rizzo was also a speaker at ''Surf Summit 13'', an event organized jointly by the Surf Industry Manufacturers Association (SIMA) and the Board Retailers Association (BRA), which was held in [[Los Cabos (Baja California Sur)|Los Cabos, Mexico]] in 2010; he made a presentation on ''The Atti-Tools for Success''.&lt;ref name=TB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.transworld.net/37595/news/close-to-300-industry-members-attend-surf-summit-13/ |title=Close To 300 Industry Members Attend Surf Summit 13 |author=Kailee Bradstreet |publisher=''[[Bonnier Corporation]]'' |magazine=''[[Bonnier Corporation#TransWorld|Transworld Business]] |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

History of mass videogaming in Russia (back then [[USSR]]) takes its roots in the early 1980s when personal computers of different models ([[Atari]] 400/800, [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]] 48/128) were brought to the country from United States, [[Europe]], Japan and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/18/-sp-tetris-russia-video-gaming|title=Beyond Tetris: a brief history of patriotic video gaming in Russia|first=Cat|last=Goodfellow|date=18 December 2014|publisher=|accessdate=2 January 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a local company, Electronica, released a series of portable game consoles which were mostly clones of [[Nintendo]] products. By the middle of the 80s Soviet programmers and enthusiasts began to try to develop their own games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rg.ru/2013/12/04/soviet-pc-site.html Most popular Soviet videogames]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fai.org.ru/forum/topic/431-sovetskie-kompyuternyie-igryi/ Old Soviet videogames]&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous Russian game designer of that era is [[Alexey Pajitnov]] who created the worldwide megahit ''[[Tetris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lookatme.ru/mag/people/experience/204853-alexey-pajitnov-interview Interview with Alexei Pazhitnov]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arcades==

The first Soviet arcade game machines did not contain digital graphics, and the games' interface had to be emulated with help of physical objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-village.ru/village/city/situation/108627-muzey-sovetskih-igrovyh-avtomatov The museum of Soviet videogame arcades re-opened at the new place]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game press==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
There were many video game magazines in Russia from the early 90s to the mid 2000s. Their quantity significantly decreased due to the massive spread of the Internet and the following boom of illegal content downloading. As a result, most of the existing magazines were discontinued due to a massive commercial loss. The most known Russian video game magazine is currently [[Igromania]].

'''What's the time, Mr Wolf?''' (also known as ''What time is it, Mr Wolf?'', ''Grandma's Footsteps'',&lt;ref&gt;''Trust and power: taking care of ourselves through drama'', Penny Casdagli, p 65&lt;/ref&gt; ''1 2 3 Piano'' in [[Belgium]] and in the [[United States]] ''What time is it, Mr. Fox?'') is a form of [[tag (game)|tag]] played in [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]],  the English-speaking [[Caribbean]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], and the [[United Kingdom]].

Because it needs attention skills, quick reactions, and working memory for the 'it' child, it is recommended by [[Harvard University]]'s Center on the Developing Child to assist in developing [[executive function]] skills for children aged 5 to 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Function Activities for 5- to 7-year-olds|url=http://developingchild.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Executive-Function-Activities-for-5-to-7-year-olds.pdf|publisher=Center on the Developing Child|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic rules==
One player is chosen to be Mr Wolf. Mr Wolf stands at the opposite end of the playing field from the other players, facing away from them. A call-and-response then takes place: all players except for Mr Wolf chant in unison "What's the time, Mr Wolf?", and Mr Wolf will answer in one of the two ways:

#Mr Wolf may call a clock time (e.g., "3 o'clock"). The other players will then take that many steps, counting them aloud as they go ("One, two, three"). Then they ask the question again.
#Mr Wolf may call "Dinner time!"/"Lunch Time", when Mr Wolf will turn around and chase the other players back to their starting point. If Mr Wolf successfully tags a player, that player becomes the new Mr Wolf for the next round.

==Variants==
It is not uncommon for Mr Wolf to be allowed to look around at the other players, before answering the question; especially if there is a rule involving penalties applied to Mr Wolf if a player reaches him before "Dinner time" is called.

There is also a simpler version of the game where Mr Wolf faces the other players, who must remain stationary until "Dinner time" is called. If any player moves on a time of day being called, that player becomes Mr Wolf.

In another version, Mr Wolf holds a dandelion seed head and blows on it. The other players dance around him/her, taunting him "What's the time, Mr Wolf?" After each blow, Mr Wolf calls out "1 o'clock", "2 o'clock" etc. until all the seed head has been blown away. Then, he calls out "Dinner time!" and chases the other players to tag them before they can claim sanctuary at pre-designated points called "Bar". The players claim "Bar" by yelling out "B - A - R  Bar" and touching the safety point. The skill is in deciding when the seed head is going to be completely blown away, as the players cannot run away until this happens. It could happen after one blow by Mr Wolf, or several. The first player tagged becomes Mr Wolf for the next round of the game.  

This game can also be played on a hopscotch court. The players chant "What's the time Mr Wolf" and the wolf replies with a time. The players hop that number of spaces forwards on the hopscotch court. If Mr Wolf answers with "It's dinner time" the players try to run back to the beginning of the hopscotch court before they are caught by Mr Wolf.

Similar games include Lupo Delle Ore in [[Italy]], and Captain Midnight in the United States, in which everyone has to start running at midnight. The game also bears some resemblance to [[Red light, green light]] and [[Dahrumasan ga koronda]].

Another variant of this game which has become popular is "Mr Shark, Mr Shark, what time is it?"  The big difference is that this game is played in a swimming pool, lake, or other swimming area.  When Lunch Time is called the player may try running through the water or swimming to get away from the shark.

A variant also exists in which the tagged players become wolves themselves, helping to tag the other players. The original wolf, however, still calls the numbers.

The variant played in the [[Low Countries]], consists of one player at one end of the playfield with his back to the other players. He then calls out "1 2 3 piano!", whilst knocking three times on the wall in front of him. As he calls out, the other players are allowed to move towards him. Once the call is finished, the player quickly turns around. The other players then need to stand as still as possible. If the caller can spot someone moving, he can send that player back to the start. This is repeated until someone is able to tap the caller without being spotted.

==Popular culture==
===In music===
*The game was the basis for a 1992 song of the same name by [[New Zealand]] band [[Southside of Bombay]], which appeared on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Once Were Warriors (film)|Once Were Warriors]]'' (1994).
*''[[What's the Time Mr Wolf? (album)|What's the Time Mr Wolf?]]'' is also the title of a 2007 album by British band [[Noisettes]].
*What Time Is It, Mr. Fox? (the common name for the game in US) is the name of a cabaret art rock band from Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Thompson, "Time has come for Mr. Fox" Boston Herald, January 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===In print===
*The game has inspired children's books with this and similar titles. One was published in 2003 and illustrated by Annie Kubler ({{ISBN|085953944X}}), a second, published in 2007, was written and illustrated by Gemma Raynor ({{ISBN|1845392779}}). Harcourt published ''What Time Is It, Mr. Crocodile'' (2002), written by Judy Sierra and illustrated by Doug Cushman.

*The game is referenced as part of an assortment of life sized games in  “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Flies Again” (2011) by ([[Frank Cottrell Boyce]]). In this charming sequel to “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang; The Magical Car” ([[Ian Fleming]]), the game is mentioned as being ‘played with real wolves’ along with other games such as Snakes and Ladders ‘with real snakes’. The references to these games take place in scenes that introduce two important characters into the main flow of the story.

===In television===
*In ''[[Line of Duty]]'' season 1, episode 5 (July 2012), DCI Gates (played by [[Lennie James]]) - knowing it's the last interaction they'll ever have - plays What's the time, Mr Wolf? with his daughters, in their grandmother's backyard.
*On ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' season 12 episode 3 (October 7th 2014), Ducky (played by [[David McCallum]]) mentioned he used to play this game with his best friend Angus as a child.

===In film===
*The 1983 New Zealand film ''[[Utu (film)|Utu]]'', an historic drama depicting a Maori exacting revenge on English settlers in the 1870s, includes a scene where Maori leader Te Wheke beheads a vicar in a church, then places the bloodied head on the pulpit, saying the line "What's the time, Mr Wolf?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/making-utu-1982/background|title=Background - Making Utu - Television - NZ On Screen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
