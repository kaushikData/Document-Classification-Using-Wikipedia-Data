{{see also|Behavior informatics}}

'''Behavioral analytics''' is a recent advancement in [[business analytics]] that reveals new insights into the behavior of consumers on [[eCommerce]] platforms, online games, web and mobile applications, and [[Internet of things|IoT]]. The rapid increase in the volume of raw event data generated by the digital world enables methods that go beyond typical analysis{{advert inline|date=May 2017}} by demographics and other traditional metrics that tell us what kind of people took what actions in the past. Behavioral analysis focuses on understanding how consumers act and why, enabling accurate predictions about how they are likely to act in the future. It enables marketers to make the right offers to the right consumer segments at the right time.

Behavioral analytics utilizes the massive volumes of raw user event data captured during sessions in which consumers use application, game, or website, including traffic data like navigation path, clicks, social media interactions, purchasing decisions and marketing responsiveness. Also, the event-data can include advertising metrics like click-to-conversion time, as well as comparisons between other metrics like the monetary value of an order and the amount of time spent on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yamaguchi|first=Kohki|title=Leveraging Advertising Data For Behavioral Insights|url=http://marketingland.com/leveraging-advertising-data-for-behavioral-insights-46467|work=Analytics &amp; Marketing Column|publisher=Marketing Land}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These data points are then compiled and analyzed, whether by looking at session progression from when a user first entered the platform until a sale was made, or what other products a user bought or looked at before this purchase. Behavioral analysis allows future actions and trends to be predicted based on the collection of such data.

While business analytics has a more broad focus on the who, what, where and when of [[business intelligence]], behavioral analytics narrows that scope, allowing one to take seemingly unrelated [[data]] points in order to extrapolate, predict and determine errors and future trends. It takes a more holistic and human view of data, connecting individual data points to tell us not only what is happening, but also how and why it is happening.

==Examples and real world applications==
[[File:Visual Representation of Events that Make Up Behavioral Analysis.png|thumb|right|Visual Representation of Events that Make Up Behavioral Analysis]]
Data shows that a large percentage of users using a certain eCommerce platform found it by searching for “Thai food” on Google. After landing on the homepage, most people spent some time on the “Asian Food” page and then logged off without placing an order. Looking at each of these events as separate data points does not represent what is really going on and why people did not make a purchase. However, viewing these data points as a representation of overall user behavior enables one to interpolate how and why users acted in this particular case.
 
Behavioral analytics looks at all site traffic and page views as a timeline of connected events that did not lead to orders. 
Since most users left after viewing the “Asian Food” page, there could be a disconnect between what they are searching for on Google and what the “Asian Food” page displays. Knowing this, a quick look at the “Asian Food” page reveals that it does not display Thai food prominently and thus people do not think it is actually offered, even though it is.

Behavioral analytics is becoming increasingly popular in commercial environments. [[Amazon.com]] is a leader in using behavioral analytics to recommend additional products that customers are likely to buy based on their previous purchasing patterns on the site.&lt;ref name=IBM&gt;{{cite web|title=Oh behave! How behavioral analytics fuels more personalized marketing |url=http://public.dhe.ibm.com/common/ssi/ecm/en/zzw03004usen/ZZW03004USEN.PDF |publisher=IBM Software |accessdate=3 July 2013 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral analytics is also used by [[Target Corporation|Target]] to suggest products to customers in their retail stores, while political campaigns use it to determine how potential voters should be approached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Homa|first=Ken|title=Behavioral analytics … bad when Target does it … OK for political campaigns?|url=http://kenhoma.wordpress.com/2012/09/19/behavioral-analytics-bad-when-target-does-it-ok-for-political-campaigns/|work=The Homa Files}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to retail and political applications, behavioral analytics is also used by banks and manufacturing firms to prioritize leads generated by their websites. Behavioral analytics also allow developers to manage users in online-gaming and web applications.&lt;ref name="IBM"/&gt;

IBM and Intel are creating ecosystems of connected solutions and advanced analytics. In retail, this is the Internet of Things (IoT) for tracking shopping behaviors.

==Types==
* Ecommerce and retail – Product recommendations and predicting future sales trends
* Online gaming – Predicting usage trends, load, and user preferences in future releases
* Application development – Determining how users use an application to predict future usage and preferences.
* [[Cohort analysis]] – Breaking users down into similar groups to gain a more focused understanding of their behavior.
* Security – Detecting compromised credentials and insider threats by locating anomalous behavior.
* Suggestions – People who liked this also liked...
* Presentation of relevant content based on user behavior.

== Components ==
An ideal behavioral analytics solution would include:
* Real-time capture of vast volumes of raw event data across all relevant digital devices and applications used during sessions
* Automatic aggregation of raw event data into relevant data sets for rapid access, filtering and analysis
* Ability to query data in an unlimited number of ways, enabling users to ask any business question
* Extensive library of built-in analysis functions such as cohort, path and funnel analysis
* A visualization component

'''Beverly Bond''' (born December 19, 1970) is an American former [[Wilhelmina Models|Wilhemenia]] model, DJ, business woman, mentor, producer, writer and founder of Black Girls Rock!. Bond is best known for her organization, Black Girls Rock! which recognizes the success of African American women.&lt;ref name=huff&gt;Anderson, Stacy A. (2011).[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/03/beverly-bond-black-girls-rock_n_1073363.html "Beverly Bond Aims to uplift Black Women With "Black Girls Rock"] ''Huffington Post.'' Retrieved 2012-11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Bond was born on December 19, 1970, in [[New York City]], New York. Bond was raised by her mother, Mary Burroughs.

As a child, Bond lived in several homes throughout the state of [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verizoninsider.com/ interview in the ''Verizon Insider''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213163621/http://www.verizoninsider.com/ |date=December 13, 2012 }} - more specific URL needed&lt;/ref&gt; Bond attended a different school every year of her childhood from kindergarten to tenth grade, and sometimes two schools in one year. Her mother collected music and told her about many genres of music, including [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], and [[Worldbeat|world beat]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[Soul music|soul]], funk, and old school. Bond started to collect her own hip-hop records, and became a serious [[Record collecting|record collector]].

==Career==

===Modelling===

At the age of seventeen, Bond moved to New York to pursue a modeling career. Her first agency was [[Elite Model Management|Elite New Faces]], where because of her 5’9 frame she was booked for jobs that were mainly for athletic brands.

Bonds signed with [[Wilhelmina Models]] and was booked for campaigns and commercials for [[Diesel jeans|Diesel Jeans]], [[Guess jeans|Guess]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and [[Nordstroms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bet.com/topics/b/beverly-bond.html "Beverly Bond"]. ''BET.com''. 14 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===DJing===
In November 1999, Bond bought a set of [[turntables]], with aspirations of using her extensive record collection to become a [[Disc jockey|DJ]]. She started deejaying at local clubs in New York. As she secured more DJ work, she gradually stopped attending modelling auditions.

Bond spun and mixed for gatherings of high-profile celebrities like [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Jay-Z]], [[P. Diddy|Sean “Puffy” Combs]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Kimora Lee Simmons]], Alicia Keys, [[Hugo Boss]], [[Andre Harrell]] and Veronica Webb, and Playboy. She spun for singer D’Angelo's ''[[Voodoo (D'Angelo album)|Voodoo]]'' album release party. She toured with [[Sunshine Anderson]] and [[Musiq Soulchild]] for the Courvoisier tour where she was the official DJ for [[Erykah Badu]], [[The Roots]], [[Amerie]], and others.

Bond has also spun at The Glamour Fashion Awards, the VH1 Fashion Awards, ESPN's X-Games Awards, The CFDA Awards, the Chanel parties (during New York Fashion Week), and the NY Planet Hollywood opening. She has appeared on BET's Rap City “The Basement” and has also appeared as a celebrity DJ at Eileen Fords “Super Model of the World” contest in Puerto Rico.

In 2012 Bond was honored at the ASCAP 4th Annual Women Behind the Music gathering in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theboombox.com/beverly-bond-ascap/ "Beverly Bond Honored at ASCAP 4th Annual Women Behind the Music Series"]. ''The Boom Box'', By Natelege Whaley October 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business engineering''' ('''BE''') is the development and implementation of business solutions, from [[business model]] to [[business process]]es and [[organizational structure]] to [[information systems]] and [[information technology]] (cf.&lt;ref name="Oesterle_1995"&gt;[[Hubert Österle]]: ''Business Engineering: Prozess- und Systementwicklung.'' Band 1: Entwurfstechniken. Springer, Heidelberg 1994; 2., verbesserte Auflage 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Business engineering focuses on developing innovative business solutions that take a [[sociotechnical system]]s (STS) approach. The STS approach addresses an enterprise as a total system in the same manner as an airplane system or an industrial facility, since they possess a similar level of complexity.

Business engineering combines knowledge in the fields of business administration, Industrial Engineering, as well as information technology and connects it to all aspects of transformation, from means of presentation to [[process model]]s to cultural and political considerations (cf. Baumöl/Jung&lt;ref name="Baumöl_Jung"&gt;Ulrike Baumöl, Reinhard Jung: ''Rekursive Transformation: Entwicklung der Business Engineering-Landkarte.'' In: [[Walter Brenner (computer scientist)|Walter Brenner]], Thomas Hess (Hrsg.): ''Wirtschaftsinformatik in Wissenschaft und Praxis – Festschrift für Hubert Österle. Business Engineering.'' Springer, Berlin 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Overview  ==
Business engineering focuses on challenges arising from the transformation of the [[industrial society]] into an [[information society]] (cf. Winter&lt;ref name="Oesterle_Winter_2003"/&gt;), that is the digitization of enterprises, economy, administration and society. Through the ongoing consumerization digital services for individuals have also become a crucial part of research (cf. Hess/Legner&lt;ref name="Hess_Legner"&gt;Thomas Hess, Christine Legner, Werner Esswein, Wolfgang Maaß, Christian Matt, [[Hubert Österle]] et al.: ''Digital Life as a Topic of Business and Information Systems Engineering?'' Business and Information Systems Engineering (forthcoming).&lt;/ref&gt;). Because of the major importance of information technology, business engineering is often held to be a subfield of Business Informatics, although it is also sometimes regarded as a form of Organization Development for its emphasis on Change Management.&lt;ref name="Sol_1995"&gt;Jeroen van Meel, [[Henk Sol]]: ''Business Engineering: Dynamic Modeling Instruments for a Dynamic World.'' Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 27 (4), 440-461.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Engineering Management]] is a very close discipline which overlaps significantly with Business Engineering; the main differences are that Industrial Engineering focuses primarily on the goods sector (less on services), on technical systems and the interface between those systems as well as the users from a production point of view.

[[Hubert Österle|Österle]]/Blessing&lt;ref name="Oesterle_Blessing_2005"&gt;[[Hubert Österle]], Dieter Blessing: ''[//www.alexandria.unisg.ch/export/DL/214185.pdf Ansätze des Business Engineering].'' In: HMD. 42, Nr. 241, 2005, S. 7-17.&lt;/ref&gt; characterize business engineering as follows:

* Beside the technical design, business engineering includes the political and cultural dimensions of a new business solution. The political and cultural dimensions and [[change management]] are crucial factors for the success or failure of a transformation (cf. Baumöl&lt;ref name="Baumöl_2010"&gt;Ulrike Baumöl: ''Cultural Change in Process Management.'' In: Jan vom Brocke, Michael Rosemann (Hrsg.): ''Handbook on Business Process Management 2.'' Springer, Berlin 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;). Therefore, business engineering is an interdisciplinary approach. It divides the design levels of a company.
* Business engineering distinguishes between a strategic, an organizational and a technological design level. Contemplating different design objects on different levels enables a focused view of the individual dimensions of transformation (,&lt;ref name="Oesterle_etal_2007"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Hubert Österle]]|Surname2=[[Robert Winter (business theorist)|Robert Winter]]|Surname3=Frank Höning|Surname4=Stephan Kurpjuweit|Surname5=Philipp Osl|Periodical=Wisu - Das Wirtschaftsstudium|Title=Business Engineering: Core-Business-Metamodell |Volume=36|Issue=2|Year=2007|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;191-194|Date=  2007|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; S. 191). Segmenting task at hand into different levels provides for security and helps reducing the complexity of the transformation process.
* Business engineering ensures a holistic view of all dimensions. It supports not only the design of new business models, [[business process]]es and [[information system]]s, but also their implementation. Therefore, it contemplates all dimensions (resources and processes involved) of the transformation.
* Business engineering refers to the method and model-based design theory for companies in the information age (,&lt;ref name="Oesterle_Winter_2003"/&gt; S. 7). Business transformations along with their technical and socio-economic aspects are far too important and complex to be realized without applying methods and models. Methods and models not only provide for transparency during the process of transformation, they also specify the division of labor, create a foundation for communication and enable the documentation of the company’s systematic reorientation. The division of labor and application of engineering principles differentiate the "construction" in accordance with business engineering from individualistic "creation" (cf.,&lt;ref name="Oesterle_Winter_2003"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Robert Winter (business theorist)|Robert Winter]]|EditorSurname1=[[Hubert Österle]]|EditorSurname2=[[Robert Winter (business theorist)|Robert Winter]]|Periodical=Business Engineering - Auf dem Weg zum Unternehmen des Informationszeitalters|Title=Modelle, Techniken und Werkzeuge im Business Engineering |Edition=2|Publisher=Springer|PublicationPlace=Berlin|Year=2003|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;87-118|Date=  2003|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; S. 88).
* Business engineering focuses on the consumer from a business perspective. As of now, this also holds true for the deep penetration of all spheres of private life with [[information technology]] (consumerization), which is equally being treated from a business and not an individual point of view.

At the Business Engineering Forum in St. Gallen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Business-Engineering-Forum |url=https://be-forum.iwi.unisg.ch/}}&lt;/ref&gt; experts from science and business annually discuss new developments within the discipline.

== Approaches ==

=== ARIS (Architecture of Integrated Information Systems) ===
The [[Architecture of Integrated Information Systems|ARIS concept]] (cf. Scheer&lt;ref name="Scheer_2001"&gt;[[August-Wilhelm Scheer]]: ''ARIS: Modellierungsmethoden, Metamodelle, Anwendungen.'' Springer, Berlin, 4.Auflage, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;) distinguishes between views and levels of description. The views are the organizational, data, performance, functional and control view of processes. For every description view there are three distinct levels of description. These are the technical concept, the data processing concept and the implementation level.
Through this framework, specific methods can be used to describe individual elements of the model. Those methods help depict and improve business processes, from fundamental business questions to the implementation on the IT level.

=== Business Engineering St. Gallen ===
The St. Gallen approach to Business Engineering comprises fundamentals and methods for different kinds of transformation projects. It distinguishes between the design level strategies, organization and information systems within the transformation process and, thus, reduces the complexity of the transformation.

* Strategy: Capabilities (incl. brand) and resources, business segments (products, services, customer segments), customer access, competitive position, ecosystem, and revenue and cost structures
* Organization: company organization structure and operational structure, focus on business processes with accompanying process performances, procedures, tasks and business objects
* Information system: System of applications and technical services, [[software]] and data components as well as [[IT infrastructure]] components. According to the relevance of IT in the respective organization, this level is further divided into the subcategories of "alignment", "software and data" and "IT infrastructure" (cf. Winter/Fischer&lt;ref name="Winter_Fischer"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Robert Winter (business theorist)|Robert Winter]], Ronny Fischer|title=Essential Layers, Artifacts, and Dependencies of enterprise architecture|journal=Journal of Enterprise Architecture|volume= 3 |issue=2|pages=7–18|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The St. Gallen approach to Business Engineering has already been applied in more than 1.000 consultancy projects (S&amp;T 2008). Moreover, it receives support from renowned software tools such as the ARIS toolset (Scheer 2001, S. 18), ADOben (Aier et al. 2008) or Semtalk.

=== Semantic Object Model (SOM) ===
The [[:de: Semantisches Objektmodell|Semantic Object Model (SOM)]] (cf. Ferstl/Sinz&lt;ref name="Ferstl_Sinz"&gt;Otto K. Ferstl, Elmar J. Sinz: ''Der Ansatz des Semantischen Objektmodells (SOM) zur Modellierung von Geschäftsprozessen.'' In: Wirtschaftsinformatik, Vol. 37 (3), 209-220, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;) provides a framework for the conceptual modeling of system types. The modeling concept differentiates three levels of such systems: The strategic business plan; the operational business process models which focus on process types; and the specifications for implementing application systems. These levels can also be regarded as constituting perspectives on the system. They correspond to the external, internal, and resource perspectives. Subsequently, the levels of the model undergo a further conceptual division according to the organizational architecture, the process model, the principles of coordination or the object system.

=== The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) ===
[[The Open Group Architecture Framework|The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)]] (cf. Weinberger&lt;ref name="Weinberger_2010"&gt;Danny Weinberger: ''...und am Anfang steht die Geschäftsanforderung, oder?'' In: OBJEKTspektrum, Ausgabe EAM, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;) presents a structure for organizational architectures which offers a holistic approach to designing, planning, implementing and maintaining information architectures and, thus, covers an important section, albeit not the entire scope, of BE. 
When applying TOGAF, the [[enterprise architecture]] is usually modeled in the three domains: [[business architecture]], [[information systems architecture]] (consisting of [[application architecture]] and [[data architecture]]), and [[technology architecture]].

=== Integral Design of Organizational Structures and Information Systems ===
Van Meel and [[Henk Sol|Sol]] (1996)&lt;ref name="Sol_1995"/&gt; define business engineering as an „integral design of organizational architectures and information systems". Dynamic modeling as well as simulation constitute the key components of their approach.

=== The3rdgear Business Engineering Model ===
With a specific focus on the demands of small business, The3rdgears' Business Engineering system has proven to be effective and relatively easy to implement for small to medium-sized businesses. Unique in that it involves the use of a specialised customisable software platform that integrates key business structures and operational performance processes. While The3rdgear system encapsulates the key areas of Strategy, Business Process, Technology and People, it has been proven to provide unusually consistent, predictable outcomes for small businesses due to the SME specific design of its improvement processes and software applications. This, combined with its ease of use for business owners and managers has made The3rdgear model popular within the SME marktet place.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Day_2011 - 'Management Trinity - How To Manage Any Business Without Having and MBA'&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business Engineering IBE Hong Kong ===
There has been another notion and approach put forth since 2005 by the Institute of Business Engineers (IBE)&lt;ref name="ibehk.org"&gt;http://www.ibehk.org/index.php/en/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iabep.org/about-us/corporate-members/&lt;/ref&gt; while sharing the common vision and advocacy of multi-disciplinary and holistic business view, and targeting the addressed issues in business practice and education.

The IBE put forth some principles and framework addressing the modeling of the business in a holistic, concise and structural manner. The model abstracts distinct, clearly defined key elements, processes, functions and relations from the complex, vague and loosely coupled business concepts. With the emphasis of holistic and integrative system view, it helps structurally and concisely capture a specific circumstance of business in four tiers, which are in turn composed of smaller constituents, for strategic planning and implementation:

* Finance: an internal tier that concisely reflects the enterprise’s financial status and performance, indicating the well-being of the enterprise by the financial data presented in balance sheet and income statement.
* Business functions: an internal tier that reflects an enterprise’s composition of the core business functions that collaboratively undertake all internal processes to achieve business goals with the constraints of their allocated cost.
* Market environment: an external tier that reflects the environment that affect the micro marketing circumstance that the business is facing. 
* Industry environment: an external tier that reflects the environment that affect the macro marketing or industrial circumstance that the business is facing.

Furthermore, to a certain extent, this model is claimed to provide a generic framework for filling the gap of other business engineering approaches in specifying business circumstances, serving as one of key pieces of puzzle in the full picture of business engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin Hui, Andrew Siu, Gary Ching: The Business “MINDFRAME”: SCPG Publishing Corporation: 2013. {{ISBN|978-1-938368-09-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin Hui, Andrew Siu, Gary Ching.

{{Business administration}}

A '''business process''' or '''business method'''  is a collection of related, structured activities or [[Task (project management)|tasks]] by people or equipment that in a specific sequence produces a service or product (serves a particular business goal) for a particular customer or customers. Business processes occur in all organizantional level and it may or may not be visible to customers. &lt;ref name="WeskeBusiness12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-D5tpT5Xz8oC&amp;pg=PA5 |chapter=Chapter 1: Introduction |title=Business Process Management: Concepts, Languages, Architectures |author=Weske, M. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=1–24 |year=2012 |isbn=9783642286162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KirchmerHigh17"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nz1RDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3 |chapter=Chapter 1: Business Process Management: What Is It and Why Do You Need It? |title=High Performance Through Business Process Management: Strategy Execution in a Digital World |author=Kirchmer, M. |publisher=Springer |pages=1–28 |year=2017 |isbn=9783319512594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vonScheelPhase114"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RT7LAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |chapter=Phase 1: Process Concept Evolution |title=The Complete Business Process Handbook: Body of Knowledge from Process Modeling to BPM |author=von Scheel, H.; von Rosing, M.; Fonseca, M. et al. |editor1=von Rosing, M.|editor2=Scheer, A.-W.|editor3=von Scheel, H. |volume=1 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |year=2014 |pages=1–10 |isbn=9780128004722}}&lt;/ref&gt; A business process may often be visualized (modeled) as a [[flowchart]] of a sequence of activities with interleaving decision points or as a process matrix of a sequence of activities with relevance rules based on data in the process.&lt;ref name="KirchmerHigh17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vonScheelPhase114" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChenBusiness12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HX3gBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA198 |chapter=Chapter 8: BPR Methodologies: Methods and Tools |title=Business Process Engineering: Advancing the State of the Art |author=Chen, M. |editor1=Elzinga, D.J.|editor2=Gulledge, T.R.|editor3=Lee, C.-Y. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=187–212 |year=2012 |isbn=9781461550914}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChandBusiness12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6oVVBNemLRMC&amp;pg=PA36 |chapter=Chapter 3: Business Process Modeling |title=Business Enterprise, Process, and Technology Management: Models and Applications |author=Chand, D.R.; Chircu, A.M. |editor=Elzinga, D.J.; Gulledge, T.R.; Lee, C.-Y. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=187–212 |year=2012 |isbn=9781466602502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of using business processes include improved customer satisfaction and improved agility for reacting to rapid market change.&lt;ref name="WeskeBusiness12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KirchmerHigh17" /&gt; Process-oriented organizations break down the barriers of structural departments and try to avoid [[functional silo]]s.

== Overview ==
A business process begins with a mission objective (an external event) and ends with achievement of the business objective of providing a result that provides customer value. Additionally, a process may be divided into subprocesses (process decomposition), the particular inner functions of the process. Business processes may also have a process owner, a responsible party for ensuring the process runs smoothly from start to finish.&lt;ref name="KirchmerHigh17" /&gt; 

Broadly speaking, business processes can be organized into three types, according to von Rosing ''et al.''&lt;ref name="vonRosingProcess14"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RT7LAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162 |chapter=Process Tagging - A Process Classification and Categorization Concept |title=The Complete Business Process Handbook: Body of Knowledge from Process Modeling to BPM |author=von Rosing, M.; Kemp, N.; Hove, M.; Ross, J.W. |editor1=von Rosing, M.|editor2=Scheer, A.-W.|editor3=von Scheel, H. |volume=1 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |year=2014 |pages=123–172 |isbn=9780128004722}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

# Operational processes, which constitute the [[core business]] and create the primary value stream, e.g., taking orders from customers, opening an account, and manufacturing a component
# [[Management process]]es, the processes that oversee operational processes, including [[corporate governance]], budgetary oversight, and employee oversight
# Supporting processes, which support the core operational processes, e.g., [[accounting]], [[recruitment]], [[call center]], [[technical support]], and safety training

A slightly different approach to these three types is offered by Kirchmer&lt;ref name="KirchmerHigh17" /&gt;:

# Operational processes, which focus on properly executing the operational tasks of an entity; this is where personnel "get the things done"
# Management processes, which ensure that the operational processes are conducted appropriately; this is where managers "ensure efficient and effective work processes"
# Governance processes, which ensure the entity is operating in full compliance with necessary legal regulations, guidelines, and shareholder expectations; this is where executives ensure the "rules and guidelines for business success" are followed

A complex business process may be decomposed into several subprocesses, which have their own attributes but also contribute to achieving the overall goal of the business. The analysis of business processes typically includes the mapping or modeling of processes and sub-processes down to activity/task level. Processes can be modeled through a large number of methods and techniques. For instance, the [[Business Process Modeling Notation]] is a [[business process modeling]] technique that can be used for drawing business processes in a visualized [[workflow]].&lt;ref name="WeskeBusiness12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KirchmerHigh17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChenBusiness12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vonRosingProcess14" /&gt; While decomposing processes into process types and categories can be useful, care must be taken in doing so as there may be crossover. In the end, all processes are part of a largely unified outcome, one of "customer value creation."&lt;ref name="vonRosingProcess14" /&gt; This goal is expedited with business process management, which aims to analyze, improve, and enact business processes.&lt;ref name="KirchmerHigh17" /&gt;

==History==
=== Adam Smith ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Division of labour]] --&gt;
An important early (1776) description of processes was that of economist [[Adam Smith]] in his famous example of a [[pin (device)|pin]] factory. Inspired by an article in [[Diderot|Diderot's]] [[Encyclopédie]], Smith described the production of a pin in the following way&lt;ref name="SmithAnInquiry27"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpMuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3 |chapter=Book I. Of the Causes of Improvement in the Productive Powers of Labour, and of the Order According to Which Its Produce Is Naturally Distributed among the Different Ranks of the People |title=An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations |author=Smith, A. |publisher=University Press; Thomas Nelson and Peter Brown |year=1827}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
”One man draws out the wire; another straights it; a third cuts it; a fourth points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another ... and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Smith also first recognized how the output could be increased through the use of [[Division of labor|labor division]]. Previously, in a society where production was dominated by [[artisan|handcrafted goods]], one man would perform all the activities required during the production process, while Smith described how the work was divided into a set of simple tasks, which would be performed by specialized workers.&lt;ref name="vonScheelPhase114" /&gt; The result of labor division in Smith’s example resulted in productivity increasing by 24,000 percent (sic), i.e. that the same number of workers made 240 times as many pins as they had been producing before the introduction of labor division.&lt;ref name="SmithAnInquiry27" /&gt;

It is worth noting that Smith did not advocate labor division at any price and ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]''. The appropriate level of task division was defined through experimental design of the production process. In contrast to Smith's view which was limited to the same functional domain and comprised activities that are in direct sequence in the manufacturing process&lt;ref name="SmithAnInquiry27" /&gt;, today's process concept includes cross-functionality as an important characteristic. Following his ideas, the division of labor was adopted widely, while the integration of tasks into a functional, or cross-functional, process was not considered as an alternative option until much later.&lt;ref name="GiaglisItsTime12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2DmCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA315 |chapter=It's Time to Engineer Re-engineering: Investigating the Potential of Simulation Modelling for Business Process Redesign |title=Business Process Modelling |author=Giaglis, G.M.; Paul, R.J. |editor=Scholz-Reiter, B.; Stickel, E. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |pages=313–329 |isbn=9783642803178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frederick Winslow Taylor ===
American engineer, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] greatly influenced and improved the quality of [[industrial processes]] in the early twentieth century. His [[Principles of Scientific Management]] focused on standardization of processes, systematic training and clearly defining the roles of management and employees.&lt;ref name="vonScheelPhase114" /&gt; His methods were widely adopted in the [[United States]], Russia and parts of Europe and led to further developments such as “time and motion study” and visual task optimization techniques, such as [[Gantt charts]].

=== Peter Drucker ===
In the latter part of the twentieth century, management guru [[Peter Drucker]] focused much of his work on simplification and decentralization of processes, which led to the concept of [[outsourcing]]. He also coined the concept of the "[[knowledge worker]] — as differentiated from manual workers — and how knowledge management would become part of an entity's processes.&lt;ref name="DruckerTheAge17"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bx0uDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=The Age of Discontinuity: Guidelines for Our Changing Society |author=Drucker, P.F. |publisher=Routledge |year=2017 |pages=420 |isbn=9781560006183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DruckerManagement07"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1YN3kc31nqAC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Management Challenges for the 21st Century |author=Drucker, P.F. |publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |pages=208 |isbn=9781136386312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other definitions ===
Davenport (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Davenport (1993). ''Process Innovation: Reengineering work through information technology''. Harvard Business School Press, Boston&lt;/ref&gt; defines a (business) process as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
”a structured, measured set of activities designed to produce a specific output for a particular customer or market. It implies a strong emphasis on how work is done within an organization, in contrast to a product focus’s emphasis on what. A process is thus a specific ordering of work activities across time and space, with a beginning and an end, and clearly defined inputs and outputs: a structure for action. ... Taking a process approach implies adopting the customer’s point of view. Processes are the structure by which an organization does what is necessary to produce value for its customers.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This definition contains certain characteristics a process must possess. These characteristics are achieved by a focus on the business logic of the process (how work is done), instead of taking a product perspective (what is done). Following Davenport's definition of a process we can conclude that a process must have clearly defined boundaries, input and output, that it consists of smaller parts, activities, which are ordered in time and space, that there must be a receiver of the process outcome- a customer - and that the transformation taking place within the process must add customer value.

Hammer &amp; Champy’s (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hammer and James Champy (1993). ''Reengineering the Corporation: A Manifesto for Business Revolution'', Harper Business&lt;/ref&gt; definition can be considered as a subset of Davenport’s. They define a process as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
”a collection of activities that takes one or more kinds of input and creates an output that is of value to the customer.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As we can note, Hammer &amp; Champy have a more transformation oriented perception, and put less emphasis on the structural component – process boundaries and the order of activities in time and space.

Rummler &amp; Brache (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Rummler &amp; Brache (1995). ''Improving Performance: How to manage the white space on the organizational chart''. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; use a definition that clearly encompasses a focus on the organization’s external customers, when stating that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
”a business process is a series of steps designed to produce a product or service. Most processes (...) are cross-functional, spanning the ‘white space’ between the boxes on the organization chart. Some processes result in a product or service that is received by an organization's external customer. We call these primary processes. Other processes produce products that are invisible to the external customer but essential to the effective management of the business. We call these support processes.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The above definition distinguishes two types of processes, primary and support processes, depending on whether a process is directly involved in the creation of customer value, or concerned with the organization’s internal activities. In this sense, Rummler and Brache's definition follows Porter's [[value chain]] model, which also builds on a division of primary and secondary activities. According to Rummler and Brache, a typical characteristic of a successful process-based organization is the absence of secondary activities in the primary value flow that is created in the customer oriented primary processes. The characteristic of processes as spanning the white space on the organization chart indicates that processes are embedded in some form of organizational structure. Also, a process can be cross-functional, i.e. it ranges over several business functions.

Johansson et al. (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Henry J. Johansson et al. (1993). ''Business Process Reengineering: BreakPoint Strategies for Market Dominance''. John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; define a process as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
”a set of linked activities that take an input and transform it to create an output. Ideally, the transformation that occurs in the process should add value to the input and create an output that is more useful and effective to the recipient either upstream or downstream.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This definition also emphasizes the constitution of links between activities and the transformation that takes place within the process. Johansson et al. also include the upstream part of the value chain as a possible recipient of the process output. Summarizing the four definitions above, we can compile the following list of characteristics for a business process:

# ''Definability'' : It must have clearly defined boundaries, input and output.
# ''Order'' : It must consist of activities that are ordered according to their position in time and space (a sequence).
# ''Customer'' : There must be a recipient of the process' outcome, a customer.
# ''Value-adding'' :  The transformation taking place within the process must add value to the recipient, either upstream or downstream.
# ''Embeddedness'' : A process cannot exist in itself, it must be embedded in an organizational structure.
# ''Cross-functionality'' : A process regularly can, but not necessarily must, span several functions.

Frequently, identifying a [[process owner]], (i.e., the person responsible for the continuous improvement of the process) is considered as a prerequisite.  Sometimes the process owner is the same person who is performing the process.

==Related concepts==

===Workflow===

[[Workflow]] is the procedural movement of information, material, and tasks from one participant to another.&lt;ref name="WeskeBusiness2_12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-D5tpT5Xz8oC&amp;pg=PA50 |chapter=Chapter 2: Evolution of Enterprise Systems Architecture |title=Business Process Management: Concepts, Languages, Architectures |author=Weske, M. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=25–72 |year=2012 |isbn=9783642286162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workflow includes the procedures, people and tools involved in each step of a business process. A single workflow may either be sequential, with each step contingent upon completion of the previous one, or parallel, with multiple steps occurring simultaneously. Multiple combinations of single workflows may be connected to achieve a resulting overall process.&lt;ref name="WeskeBusiness2_12" /&gt;

===Business process re-engineering===

[[Business process re-engineering]] (BPR) was originally conceptualized by Hammer and Davenport as a means to improve organizational effectiveness and productivity. It consisted of starting from a blank slate and completely recreating major business processes as well as the use of information technology for significant performance improvement. The term unfortunately became associated with corporate "downsizing" in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="KockProcess99"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2MWwin1QSYC&amp;pg=PA18 |chapter=Chapter 2: What Is a Process? |title=Process Improvement and Organizational Learning: The Role of Collaboration Technologies |author=Kock, N.F. |publisher=Idea Group Publishing |year=1999 |pages=17–28 |isbn=9781878289582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business process management (BPM)===

Though the term has been used contextually to mixed effect, "[[business process management]]" (BPM) can generally be defined as a discipline involving a combination of a wide variety of business activity flows (e.g., [[business process automation]], modeling, and optimization) that strives to support the goals of an enterprise within and beyond multiple boundaries, involving many people, from employees to customers and external partners.&lt;ref name="SwensonPhase4_14"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RT7LAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA79 |chapter=Phase 4: What Is Business Process Management? |title=The Complete Business Process Handbook: Body of Knowledge from Process Modeling to BPM |author=Swenson, K.D.; von Rosing, M. |editor1=von Rosing, M.|editor2=Scheer, A.-W.|editor3=von Scheel, H. |volume=1 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |year=2015 |pages=79–88 |isbn=9780127999593}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major part of BPM's enterprise support involves the continuous evaluation of existing processes and the identification of ways to improve upon it, resulting in a cycle of overall organizational improvement.

===Knowledge management===

[[Knowledge management]] is the definition of the knowledge that employees and systems use to perform their functions and maintaining it in a format that can be accessed by others. The Duhon and the Gartner Group have defined it as "a discipline that promotes an integrated approach to identifying, capturing, evaluating, retrieving, and sharing all of an enterprise's information assets. These assets may include databases, documents, policies, procedures, and previously un-captured expertise and experience in individual workers."&lt;ref name="NikolićContemp13"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.iiakm.org/ojakm/articles/2013/volume1_1/OJAKM_Volume1_1pp72-81.pdf |format=PDF |title=Contemporary management in a higher education institution in Serbia |journal=Online Journal of Applied Knowledge Management |author=Nikolić, B.; Dakić, J.; Ružić-Dimitrijević, L. |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=72–81 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Total quality management===

[[Total quality management]] (TQM) emerged in the early 1980s as organizations sought to improve the quality of their products and services. It was followed by the [[Six Sigma|Six Sigma methodology]] in the mid-1980s, first introduced by Motorola. Six Sigma consists of statistical methods to improve business processes and thus reduce defects in outputs. The "lean approach" to quality management was introduced by the Toyota Motor Company in the 1990s and focused on customer needs and reduction of wastage.&lt;ref name="Juran"&gt;{{Citation | last = Juran | first = Joseph M. | author-link = Joseph M.

In my management advisory activities I run into scores of these different programs all parading under the same name.  Few are alike, and those varied programs have a wide variety of features—a mixture of the old and the new—with, in more cases than not, very little of the new.  ...  However, I have forewarned you there are almost as many different TQM programs as there are companies that have started them because that creates confusion about what to do in your own case.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information technology as an enabler for business process management===

Advances in information technology over the years, have changed business processes within and between business enterprises. In the 1960s, operating systems had limited functionality, and any workflow management systems that were in use were tailor-made for the specific organization. The 1970s-1980s saw the development of data-driven approaches, as data storage and retrieval technologies improved. Data modeling rather than process modeling was the starting point for building an information system. Business processes had to adapt to information technology because process modeling was neglected. The shift towards process-oriented management occurred in the 1990s. Enterprise resource planning software with workflow management components such as SAP, Baan, [[PeopleSoft]], Oracle and [[JD Edwards]] emerged, as did business process management systems (BPMS) later.&lt;ref name="PalmeriBPM_14"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=iBPM - Intelligent Business Process Management |title=The Complete Business Process Handbook: Body of Knowledge from Process Modeling to BPM |author=Palmer, N. |editor1=von Rosing, M.|editor2=Scheer, A.-W.|editor3=von Scheel, H. |volume=1 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |year=2015 |pages=349–361 |isbn=9780127999593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world of e-business created a need to automate business processes across organizations, which in turn raised the need for standardized protocols and web services composition languages that can be understood across the industry. The [[Business Process Modeling Notation]] (BPMN) and [[Business Motivation Model]] (BMM) are widely used standards for business modeling.&lt;ref name="KirchmerHigh17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vonScheelPhase114" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChenBusiness12" /&gt; The Business Modeling and Integration Domain Task Force (BMI DTF) is a consortium of vendors and user companies that continues to work together to develop standards and specifications to promote collaboration and integration of people, systems, processes and information within and across enterprises.&lt;ref name="OMGBusiness"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omg.org/bmi/ |title=Business Modeling &amp; Integration DTF |publisher=Object Management Group |accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent trends in BPM are influenced by the emergence of [[cloud technology]], the prevalence of [[social media]], mobile technology, and the development of analytical techniques. Cloud-based technologies allow companies to purchase resources quickly and as required independent of their location. Social media, websites and smart phones are the newest channels through which organizations reach and support their customers. The abundance of customer data collected through these channels as well as through call center interactions, emails, voice calls, and customer surveys has led to a huge growth in data analytics which in turn is utilized for performance management and improving the ways in which the company services its customers.&lt;ref name="RossSMAC13"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://analytics-magazine.org/analytics-and-business-process-management/ |title=Analytics &amp; Business Process Management |author=Ross, M. |work=Analytics |publisher=Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences |date=July-August 2013 |accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of the process chain==

Business processes comprise a set of sequential sub-processes or tasks with alternative paths, depending on certain conditions as applicable, performed to achieve a given objective or produce given outputs. Each process has one or more needed inputs. The inputs and outputs may be received from, or sent to other business processes, other [[organizational unit]]s, or internal or external stakeholders.&lt;ref name="WeskeBusiness12" /&gt;

Business processes are designed to be operated by one or more business functional units, and emphasize the importance of the “[[process chain]]” rather than the individual units.

In general, the various tasks of a business process can be performed in one of two ways&lt;ref name="WeskeBusiness12" /&gt;:

# manually
# by means of business [[data processing]] systems such as [[ERP system]]s

Typically, some process tasks will be manual, while some will be computer-based, and these tasks may be sequenced in many ways. In other words, the data and information that are being handled through the process may pass through manual or computer tasks in any given order.

==Policies, processes and procedures==

The above improvement areas are equally applicable to policies, processes, [[Procedure (business)|detailed procedures]] (sub-processes/tasks) and [[Work instruction|work instructions]]. There is a cascading effect of improvements made at a higher level on those made at a lower level.&lt;ref name="RohdeEffective09"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ymOtDqFjMwYC&amp;pg=PA105 |chapter=Chapter 7: Communicating Your Process Through Effective Policies, Procedures, and Job Aides |title=Effective Process Management: Improving Your Healthcare Delivery |author=Rohde, K.R. |publisher=HC Pro |pages=105–128 |isbn=9781601466549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a recommendation to replace a given policy with a better one is made with proper justification and accepted in principle by business process owners, then corresponding changes in the consequent processes and procedures will follow naturally in order to enable implementation of the policies.

==Reporting as an essential base for execution==

Business processes must include up-to-date and accurate [[business reporting|reports]] to ensure effective action.&lt;ref name="RosingWorking_14"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Working with the Business Process Management (BPM) Life Cycle |title=The Complete Business Process Handbook: Body of Knowledge from Process Modeling to BPM |author=von Rosing, M.; Foldager, U.; Hove, M. et al. |editor1=von Rosing, M.|editor2=Scheer, A.-W.|editor3=von Scheel, H. |volume=1 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |year=2015 |pages=265–341 |isbn=9780127999593}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the availability of [[purchase order]] status reports for supplier delivery follow-up as described in the section on effectiveness above. There are numerous examples of this in every possible business process.

Another example from production is the process of analysis of line [[wikt:reject|reject]]ions occurring on the shop floor. This process should include systematic periodical analysis of rejections by reason, and present the results in a suitable information report that pinpoints the major reasons, and trends in these reasons, for management to take [[corrective action]]s to control rejections and keep them within acceptable limits. Such a process of analysis and summarisation of line rejection events is clearly superior to a process which merely inquires into each individual rejection as it occurs.

Business [[process owner]]s and operatives should realise that process improvement often occurs with introduction of appropriate transaction, operational, highlight, exception or [[Management information system|M.I.S.]] reports, provided these are consciously used for day-to-day or periodical decision-making. With this understanding would hopefully come the willingness to invest time and other resources in business process improvement by introduction of useful and relevant reporting systems.

== Supporting theories and concepts ==

=== Span of control ===
The [[span of control]] is the number of subordinates a supervisor manages within a structural [[organization]]. Introducing a business process concept has a considerable impact on the structural elements of the organization and thus also on the span of control.&lt;ref name="GlykasBusiness12"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=A Holistic Business Performance Measurement Framework |title=Business Process Management: Theory and Applications |author=Sezenias, E.; Farmakis, A.; Karagiannis, G. et al. |editor=Glykas, M. |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |pages=75–98 |isbn=9783642284090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large organizations that are not organized as markets need to be organized in smaller units – [[departmentalization|departments]] – which can be defined according to different principles.

=== Information management concepts ===
[[Information management]], and the organization infrastructure strategies related to it, are a theoretical cornerstone of the business process concept, requiring "a framework for measuring the level of IT support for business processes."&lt;ref name="SidorovaTheRole14"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Role of Information Technology in Business Process Management |title=The Role of Information Technology in Business Process Management |author=Sidorova, A.; Torres, R.; Al Beayeyz, A. |editor=vom Brocke, J.; Rosemann, M. |publisher=Springer |series=International Handbooks on Information Systems |pages=421–444 }year=2014 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-45100-3_18 |isbn=9783642451003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cholzer Chancy''' (born 16 February 1967) is a Haitian politician. He was Speaker of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Haiti)|Chamber of Deputies]] between 11 January 2016 and 11 January 2018. He is a member of the political party [[Haiti in Action]].

==Career==
Chancy was born on 16 February 1967 in [[Ennery, Artibonite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.leparlementhaitien.info/chambredesdeputes/fr/la-chambre-des-deputes/nos-deputes/156-chancy-cholzer#biographie |title=Chancy Cholzer |language=French |publisher=Parliament of Haiti |date= |accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were both farmers and Chancy aspired a career in agriculture. Chancy did however not manage to enter the faculty of agriculture at university and instead went to the ''l'Institut national d'administration, de gestion et des hautes études internationales'' (INAGHEI) in 1991. After studying Chancy became a businessman and owned a [[Texaco]] petrol station.&lt;ref name=nouvelliste&gt;{{cite web|author=Claude Gilles |url=http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/104813/Cholzer-Chancy-plus-entrepreneur-que-politique |title=Cholzer Chancy, plus entrepreneur que politique |language=French |publisher=[[Le Nouvelliste (Haiti)|Le Nouvelliste]] |date=9 May 2012 |accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chancy ran as a candidate of the party ''l'espace de concertation'' for the [[Chamber of Deputies (Haiti)|Chamber of Deputies]] in the [[Haitian parliamentary election, 2000|2000 parliamentary elections]], he however retracted his candidacy for the second round. He was elected in the [[Haitian general election, 2006|2006 elections]] for the party [[Haiti in Action]]. Chancy was re-elected in the [[Haitian general election, 2010–11|2010 elections]].&lt;ref name=nouvelliste/&gt; During this term he served as President of the Finance commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yvince Hilaire |url=http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/154525/Cholzer-Chancy-le-president-de-la-Chambre-basse-se-prononce-sur-des-dossiers-brulants |title=Cholzer Chancy, le président de la Chambre basse, se prononce sur des dossiers brûlants |language=French |publisher=Le Nouvelliste |date=15 January 2016 |accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Country attractiveness''' is a multidisciplinary concept at the crossroads of [[development economics]], [[financial economics]], [[comparative law]] and [[political science]]: it aims at tracking and contrasting the relative appeal of different territories and [[jurisdiction]]s competing for “scarce” investment inflows, by scoring them [[Numerical data|quantitatively]] and [[qualitative data|qualitatively]] across ''ad hoc'' series of variables such as [[GDP growth]], [[tax rate]]s, capital [[repatriation]] … etc.

There are multiple factors determining host country attractiveness in the eyes of large foreign direct [[institutional investor]]s, notably [[pension fund]]s and [[sovereign wealth fund]]s. Research conducted by the World Pensions Council (WPC) suggests that perceived legal/political stability over time and medium-term economic growth dynamics constitute the two main determinants&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=M. Nicolas Firzli &amp; Vincent Bazi |title= Infrastructure Investments in an Age of Austerity : The Pension and Sovereign Funds Perspective|url= http://worldpensions.org/uploads/Infra_Investments...Pension___SWF_Perspective__4Q_2011.pdf| work=Revue Analyse Financière, volume 41, pp. 34-37 |date=October 2011|accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[development economist]]s believe that a sizeable part of [[Western Europe]] has now fallen behind the most dynamic amongst Asia’s [[emerging markets]], notably because the latter  adopted policies more propitious to long-term investments: “Successful countries such as [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]] and [[South Korea]] still remember the harsh adjustment mechanisms imposed abruptly upon them by the IMF and World Bank during the 1997-1998 ‘Asian Crisis’ […] What they have achieved in the past 10 years is all the more remarkable: they have quietly abandoned the “Washington consensus” [the dominant Neoclassical perspective] by investing massively in infrastructure projects […] this pragmatic approach proved to be very successful.”&lt;ref name="Euromoney "&gt;{{Cite news|author=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5147">The '''dividends-received deduction'''&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Internal Revenue Code Section 243 (regarding domestic corporations) and Section 245 (regarding foreign corporations).&lt;/ref&gt; (or "'''DRD'''"), under [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. federal income tax law]], is a [[tax deduction]] received by a [[corporation]] on the [[dividend]]s it receives by other corporations in which it has an ownership stake.

==History==
{{Empty section|date=June 2008}}

==Impact==
This deduction is designed to reduce the consequences of alleged [[triple taxation]].&lt;ref&gt;"Triple taxation" occurs if, and only if, the taxes paid on the profits are not passed on to the corporation's customers.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, corporate profits would be taxed to the corporation that earned them, then to the corporate shareholder, and then to the individual shareholder. While Congress allowed for double taxation on corporations, it did not intend a triple - and potentially infinitely-tiered - tax to apply to corporate profits at every level of their distribution. 
The dividends-received deduction complements the [[consolidated return]] regulations, which allow affiliated corporations to file a single consolidated return for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

==Application==
Generally, if a corporation receives dividends from another corporation, it is entitled to a deduction of 50 percent of the dividend it receives.&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Code Section 243(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; If the corporation receiving the dividend owns 20 percent or more, then the amount of the deduction increases to 65 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Code Section 243(c).&lt;/ref&gt; If, on the other hand, the corporation receiving the dividend owns more than 80 percent of the distributing corporation, it is allowed to deduct 100 percent of the dividend it receives.&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Code Section 243(a)(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that in order for the deduction to apply, the corporation paying the dividend must also be liable for tax (''i.e.'', it must be subject to the double taxation that the deduction is intended to prevent).&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Code Section 243(d).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
''The Taxable Income Limitation -''
The dividends received deduction is limited with regard to the corporate shareholder’s taxable income. Per §246(b) of the IRC, a corporation with the rights to a seventy percent dividends received deduction, can deduct the dividend amount only up to seventy percent of the corporation’s taxable income. Furthermore, a corporation with the rights to an eighty percent dividends received deduction can deduct the dividend amount only up to eighty percent of the corporation’s taxable income. There are two exceptions to The Taxable Income Limitation. No taxable income restriction is placed on a corporation with a one-hundred percent dividends received deduction. Second, if the dividends received deduction increases or creates a net operating loss, the limitation does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/publications/p542/ar02.html#en_US_2011_publink1000257826&lt;/ref&gt;

For purposes of determining the appropriate dividends received deduction, a corporate shareholder’s taxable income should be computed without including net operating losses (NOL’s), capital loss carrybacks, and the dividends received deduction.

''The Holding Period Limitation –''
In order to receive the tax benefit of a dividends received deduction, a corporate shareholder must hold all shares of the distributing corporation’s stock for a period of more than 45 days. Per §246(c)(1)(A), a dividends received deduction is denied under §243 with respect to any share of stock that is held by the taxpayer for 45 days or less.

The complexity of this limitation is amplified per §246(c)(4). Section 246(c)(4) states that the stock’s holding period is reduced for any period in which the taxpayer has an option to sell, is under a contractual obligation to sell, or has made a short sale of substantially identical securities. In revenue ruling 94-28, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) explains that the principle behind §246(c)(4) is to deny credit toward the 45-day holding period for any period during which the taxpayer is protected from the risk of loss inherent in the ownership of an equity interest.

''Debt-financed Dividends Received Limitation –''
Code Section 246A disallows the benefit of the dividends received deduction for debt financed purchases of corporate portfolio stock. As stated by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the provision reduces the deduction for dividends received on debt-financed portfolio stock. Therefore, the dividends received deduction is available only with respect to dividends “attributable” to stock financed through other means besides debt. A simple ratio is computed to determine what percentage of an investment is debt-financed. As a result, the dividends received deduction is reduced by the percentage of the investment funded by debt.

==Accusations, EU sanctions==
In 2011, after the wave of repressions that followed the [[Belarusian presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential election in Belarus]], Dmitry Lukashenko became subject to an [[International sanctions|EU travel ban and asset freeze]] as part of a sanctions list of 208 individuals responsible for political repressions, electoral fraud and propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nn.by/?c=ar&amp;i=61552 Поўны спіс 208 беларускіх чыноўнікаў, якім забаронены ўезд у ЕС] – [[Nasha Niva]], October 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The sanctions were lifted in 2016.

In the [[Council of the European Union|EU Council]]'s decision,&lt;ref name=EU2012&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec/2012/642/oj Council Decision 2012/642/CFSP of 15 October 2012 concerning restrictive measures against Belarus]&lt;/ref&gt; Dmitry Lukashenko has been described as "Businessman, with active participation in financial operations involving the Lukashenka family.”

'''Geldolph Adriaan "Dolf" Kessler''' (2 April 1884 – 20 August 1945) was a Dutch [[association football|footballer]] and industrialist. Kessler – along with brother [[Boeli Kessler|Boeli]] and cousins [[Tonny Kessler|Tonny]] and [[Dé Kessler|Dé]] – played club football for amateur side [[HVV Den Haag]]. Kessler also won three caps for the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national side]] between 1905 and 1906.

==Family Background==

Kessler was born in a very wealthy family from [[The Hague]], the oldest son of six children. His father [[Jean Baptiste August Kessler]] (1853–1900) was the first director of the Koninklijke Maatschappij tot exploitatie van Petroleumbronnen in Nederlandsch-Indië (K.N.M.E.P.) (''Royal Dutch Society for the exploitation of Petroleumsources in the Dutch East-Indies''), which would eventually turn into the Koninklijke Nederlandse Petroleum Maatschappij (''Royal Dutch Petroleum Company''), now named [[Royal Dutch Shell]].

==Football career==

Dolf made his debut as a football player at seventeen years of age, at the Hague football club [[HVV Den Haag|HVV]]. At first he stood leftback, later he was a right winger. At HVV he became national champion four times between 1901 and 1905. On 30 April 1905 he was captain during the first official interland of the Dutch national team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Player profile at VoetbalStats.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; They beat Belgium with a 4–1 score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutch Biographical Dictionary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second interland and first home match also saw Kessler leading the team. For his third and last interland in 1906 Dolf had passed the captaincy on to [[Kees Bekker]]. Kessler seriously considered a career in football until later that year he dislocated his knee, ending his career in football. Sports, however, remained important to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Clercq|2010|p=86, "Bep Kessler-Stoop: Het is al Oprechtheid en Oorssponkelijkheid"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==

In 1907 Kessler graduated from the [[Delft University of Technology|Technische Hogeschool Delft]] (''Delft University of Technology''), as a mechanical engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutch Biographical Dictionary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He got a job as secretary for [[Henri Deterding]], who had succeeded Dolf's father as the director of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gerretson|1953|p=173, Vol. 2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for the company until 1915, when he left to look for a different job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jonker|2007|p=356, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Joost Jonker and Jan Luiten van Zanden write in ''A History of the Royal Dutch Shell'', his fiancée, Elizabeth "Bep" Stoop (herself a daughter of a prominent oil explorer, [[Adriaan Stoop]]), "put his love for her to the test by asking him to choose between her and the Group."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jonker|2007|p=357, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His younger brother [[Jean Baptiste August "Guus" Kessler Jr.]], who had married Bep's cousin, Anna Francoise "Ans" Stoop, continued with the Royal Dutch and eventually rose to head their father's company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jonker|2007|p=487, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918 Dolf joined the committee for the funding of the [[Koninklijke Hoogovens|Hoogovens]] (''Dutch Blast Furnaces'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutch Biographical Dictionary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 he became economical director and from 1924 on he was also the director-general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutch Biographical Dictionary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered a very innovative manager, steering the company through the difficult economic environment of the Great Depression; he also believed it was necessary to provide fair wages and establish a pension plan—unusual for that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|De Vries|1968|pp=295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; "His drive, entrepreneurship, imagination and leadership secured Hoogovens a firm foothold in a very competitive industry at a very difficult time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jonker|2007|p=357, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolf and his brother Guus, as leading figures in two major Dutch business concerns, at one point formed a joint venture between the Hoogovens and Royal Dutch Shell to combat a perceived threat to the oil business by [[IG Farben]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buchanan|2006|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kessler would remain the director of Hoogovens until his death from a brain tumor in 1945, with a short break during the [[Second World War]], when the Germans kept him hostage in camp [[Gymnasium Beekvliet|Beekvliet]] in [[Sint-Michielsgestel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutch Biographical Dictionary.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Dolf and his wife Bep (1891–1968) had four sons and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutch Biographical Dictionary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their home, known as Slingerduin or the Villa Kessler, was built and designed in 1929 by the prominent Dutch architect [[Hendrik Wouda]] (1885–1946), a follower of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Clercq|2010|p=91, "Bep Kessler-Stoop: Het is al Oprechtheid en Oorssponkelijkheid"}}&lt;/ref&gt; They owned of one of the few known paintings by [[Hercules Seghers]] (1589/90–1637/38)--"River Valley" (1620)--which now is displayed by the [[Mauritshuis]] Museum (Royal Picture Galley) in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arcade.nyarc.org/record=b1056453~S7 Frick Art Reference Library: Provenance, sold in 1969 by estate of E.M.L. Kessler-Stoop, IJmuiden, and bought with the help of the Vereniging Rembrandt, the Prince Bernhard Fund, the Koninklijk Nederlandse Hoogovens en Staalfabrieken N.V. (Successors of the Royal Netherlands Blast Furnaces and Steel Foundry), IJmuiden, and the Johan Maurits van Nassau Fondation, for the Mauritshuis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3047570?uid=3739936&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101948577097 Kessler-Stoop painting also referenced in Leo C. Collins, Hercules Seghers, University of Chicago Press, 1953]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kessler was an uncle of the Dutch diplomat and historian [[Max Kohnstamm]] (1914–2010), with whom he was interned at camp [[Gymnasium Beekvliet|Beekvliet]] in [[Sint-Michielsgestel]]; they became quite close there despite the difference in age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Clercq|2010|p=105, "Bep Kessler-Stoop: Het is al Oprechtheid en Oorssponkelijkheid"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American journalist [[Glenn Kessler (journalist)|Glenn Kessler]] is one of his grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/19/style/cynthia-rich-and-glenn-kessler-marry.html New York Times 19 September 1988 – Cynthia Rich and Glenn Kessler marry]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Rijksmuseum]] published, as part of its Studies in Photography series, "Around the World in 87 Photographs: Dolph Kessler's Grand Tour, 1908," by Mickey Hoyle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nederlandsfotomuseum.nl/webshop/around-the-world-in-87-photographs-dolph-kesslers-grand-tour-1908-mickey-hoyle/ –  Nieuw: Around the World in 87 Photographs: Dolph Kessler's Grand Tour, 1908]&lt;/ref&gt; Kessler took photographs while traveling on business for Royal Dutch Shell with Deterding. His photographs, and the commentary he wrote to his mother, are described as an early example of a photographic travel journal, as very few people at that time were privileged to make such a journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoyle|2016|p=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Conflict of laws}}
In [[law]], '''''dépeçage''''' is a [[conflict of laws]] where different issues within a case may be governed by the laws of different states.  In [[common law]] countries ''dépeçage'' usually means a single [[contract]] which provides that different parts of the contract shall be governed by different laws.&lt;ref&gt;''Broome v Antler's Hunting Club'' 595 F.2d 921, 923; ''Don King Productions, Inc. v. Douglas'', 742 F.Supp.2d 786, 791 (S.D.N.Y. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, "depecage choice of law theory" is where the court considers disagreement among states over which rule of law is applicable to each issue.&lt;ref&gt;''Lazzara v Howard A Esser Inc'' D.C.Ill 622 F.Supp 382, 384&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept originated in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries, but has also been adopted in common law countries such as the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] pursuant to the [[Rome Convention (contract)|Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations]] (Article 3(1)).

In practice, it is relatively rare for a contract to have more than one expressly chosen governing law.  Two examples of such situations are:
* In [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] transactions governed by [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] (ISDA) standard documentation, it is not uncommon for the [[ISDA Master Agreement]] to be governed by the laws of [[New York (state)|New York]] state, and for the Credit Support Annexe to be governed by [[English law]].  This is because the provisions of English law relating to title transfer under the Credit Support Annexe are thought to be more favourable to the secured party than New York law under the equivalent Credit Support Annexe published by ISDA.  In reality however, although the Annex is described as forming part of the same agreement as the Master Agreement, physically as well as conceptually, they are really two separate documents.
* In ship financing transactions, it is quite common for a statutory ship mortgage to be taken over the vessel which will be governed by the laws of the state in which the ship is registered (which will often be an [[Offshore Financial Centre]] or jurisdiction which provides for [[flag of convenience|flags of convenience]]), however, such mortgages are usually supplemented by a separate deed of covenants, and these will normally be governed by the law which governs the primary financial documentation.

''' EVR Periyar Salai '''(EVR High Road)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/whats-in-a-name/article5048779.ece&lt;/ref&gt;, earlier known as '''Poonamallee High Road''' '''([[National Highway 48 (India) | NH 48 ]])''', is an arterial road in [[Chennai]], [[India]]. It is the longest road in Chennai. Running from east to west, the {{convert|14|km|mi|adj=on}} road starts at Muthuswamy Bridge near [[Madras Medical College]] at [[Park Town, Chennai|Park Town]] and ends near [[Maduravoyal Junction]] via [[Kilpauk]], [[Aminjikarai]], [[Anna Nagar|Anna Nagar Arch]], [[Arumbakkam]], [[Koyambedu]]. It further continues west towards [[Poonamallee]] and traverses [[Sriperumbudur]], [[Walajapet]], and [[Ranipet]].

The road, particularly along its eastern end, has some of the most impressive civic institutions and heritage structures of the city, including the [[Ripon Building]] (the seat of civic body), the [[Victoria Public Hall]] (the city's Town Hall), the [[Chennai Central|Central train station]], the [[Moore Market]] (razed in the late 20th century), [[Madras Medical College]], and [[St Andrew's Church, Chennai|St Andrew’s Kirk]].

It connects two of the vital transport installations of the city, viz. [[Chennai Central]] railway station and the [[CMBT]]. The road has more hospitals than any other roads in the city and is popularly known as the city's 'Med street'. The road is named after the noted Social activist and politician [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==History==
Poonamallee High Road, the city’s longest road, was built to connect [[Fort St. George (Chennai)|Fort St. George]] to a British military installation some 23 kilometers west of the city.

==The road==
EVR Periyar Salai is {{convert|6|m|ft|spell=in}} wide in most stretches, except for the stretch between [[Koyambedu]] and [[Anna Nagar|Anna Nagar Arch]], which has only four lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Traffic happier as PH Road widened | newspaper = The Hindu | location = Chennai | pages = | date = 5 March 2013 | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/traffic-happier-as-ph-road-widened/article4476120.ece?ref=sliderNews | accessdate = 6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The width of the road varies from two to nine lanes or from {{convert|12|to|35|m|ft}}. The road narrows at the stretches between [[Ripon Building]] and Government Fine Arts College, Pachaiyappa's College and Shenoy Nagar junction, and DG Vaishnav College and Koyambedu. The road has not been widened since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="TOI_90MinNightmare"/&gt; The road is used by more than 185,000 vehicles every day. Heavy containers from and to the Chennai Port use this road at night, making it one of the heavily worn roads of the city and necessitating regular re-laying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Re-laying of Poonamallee High Road begins | newspaper = The Hindu | location = Chennai | pages = | date = 3 February 2014 | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/relaying-of-poonamallee-high-road-begins/article5646313.ece | accessdate = 9 Feb 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, about 11,000&amp;nbsp;passenger cars cross any given point of the road every hour.

In 2011, the bridge across Cooum river at Aminjikkarai was widened at a cost of {{INR}} 69 million.

In 2013, a new and wider bridge on the road across the Cooum river near Ampa Skywalk was planned at an estimated cost of {{INR}} 80 million under the Chennai Metropolitan Development Programme (CMDP). The 47-m-long bridge with 10 lanes, which will be the third "high-level bridge" over the river, will be broader than the road with 6 lanes. The bridge, at road level, will be at a height of 9.5&amp;nbsp;m from the riverbed. The bridge will have the same design as the old one abutting it, with two abutments and two piers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

=='Med street'==
With several hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and diagnostic laboratories dotting its entire length, EVR Periyar Salai is often called Chennai's 'med street', similar to [[London]]'s [[Harley Street]]. The establishment of two of the major government-run hospitals, the [[Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, Chennai|Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital]] and the [[Kilpauk Medical College|Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital]], remains a significant reason behind the road's morphing into a medical destination. The stretch is also home to Pandalai Nursing Home, one of the earliest private hospitals in the city, established in 1932, prior to which all hospitals were run by either the British or missionaries. Many private healthcare centres were opened since then, such as Sundaravadanan Nursing Home in 1934 and Ramarau Polyclinic in 1938, which had one of the earliest X-ray units. The stretch also has about 25 standalone pharmacies.&lt;ref name="Hindu_DocsDreamDestination"&gt;{{Cite news

==Widening==
In May 2013, a 300-m stretch of the road at Shenoy Nagar near Aminjikarai which acted as a bottleneck was widened, following a Madras High Court ruling. Officials of the state highways department cleared the encroachments that had reduced the width of the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Selvaraj | first = A. | title = Highways pulls down shops, widens road near Aminjikarai | newspaper = The Times of India | location = Chennai | pages = | date = 1 May 2013 | url = http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Source=Page&amp;Skin=TOINEW&amp;BaseHref=TOICH/2013/05/01&amp;PageLabel=4&amp;EntityId=Ar00403&amp;ViewMode=HTML | accessdate = 5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future projects==
In the early 2000s, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) conceived an idea of a 6.5-km stretch connecting the two arterial stretches of Poonamallee High Road and [[Anna Salai]] in the city. The idea is to create a traffic corridor connecting Anna Salai and Poonamallee High Road through the congested neighbourhoods of Chetpet, Nungambakkam and T. Nagar. In 2014, the Corporation modified the original alignment to create two corridors, namely, a 3.5-km stretch from Anna Salai to Mahalingapuram and a 3-km flyover connecting Thirumalai Pillai Road and Poonamallee High Road (covering five traffic bottlenecks in Chetpet junction, Sterling Road junction, Tank Bund Road junctions and Valluvar Kottam High Road junction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Xavier Lopez | first = Aloysius | title = Anna Salai-P.H.

In 2014, the highways department fixed the alignment of a 5.18-km-long, 4-laned elevated corridor that will take off at Raja Muthiah Salai, near Ripon Buildings, and descend near Pulla Reddy Avenue in [[Shenoy Nagar]]. The project has been estimated to cost {{INR}}4,500 million.&lt;ref name="Hindu_AlignmentFixedForElevatedCorridor"/&gt;

The '''Enterprise Bus Matrix''' is a [[data Warehouse]] planning tool and model created by [[Ralph Kimball]], and is part of the Data Warehouse Bus Architecture. The Matrix is the logical definition of one of the core concepts of Kimball’s approach to Dimensional Modeling – Conformed dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kimballgroup.com/2003/09/15/design-tip-49-off-the-bench/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216080251/http://www.kimballgroup.com/2003/09/15/design-tip-49-off-the-bench/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-16 |title=Design Tip #49: Off The Bench |publisher=Kimball Group |date=2003-09-15 |accessdate=2015-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bus Matrix defines part of the Data Warehouse Bus Architecture and is an output of the Business Requirements phase in [[The Kimball Lifecycle]]. It is applied in the following phases of [[dimensional modeling]] and development of the Data Warehouse . The matrix can be categorized as a hybrid model, being part technical design tool, part project management tool and part communication tool&lt;ref name="Kimball"&gt;Kimball, Ralph &amp; Ross, Margy; The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling, 2nd Edition John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Enterprise Bus Matrix stems from the issue of how one goes about creating the overall Data Warehouse environment.  Historically there has been the structure of the centralized and planned approach and the more loosely defined, department specific, solutions developed in a more independent matter. Autonomous projects can result in a range of isolated stove pipe data marts. Naturally each approach has its issues; the overall visionary approach often struggles with long delivery cycles and lack of reaction time as the formalities and scope issues is evident. On the other hand, the development of isolated data marts, leading to [[Stovepipe system]]s that lacks synergy in development. Over time this approach will lead to a so-called data-mart-in-a-box architecture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mimno.com/avoiding-mistakes3.html#6]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704220014/http://www.mimno.com/avoiding-mistakes3.html#6 |date=July 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[interoperability]] and lack of cohesion is apparent, and can hinder the realization of an overall enterprise Data Warehouse. As an attempt to handle this matter [[Ralph Kimball]] introduced the enterprise bus.

==Bus matrix==
The bus matrix purpose is one of high abstraction and visionary planning on the Data Warehouse architectural level. By dictating coherency in the development and implementation of an overall Data Warehouse the Bus Architecture approach enables an overall vision of the broader enterprise integration and consistency while at the same time dividing the problem into more manageable parts&lt;ref name="Kimball" /&gt; – all in a technology and software independent manner .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/713 |title=Data Warehouse: Ralph Kimball’s Vision by Katherine Drewek |publisher=Beyenetwork |date=2005-03-16 |accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bus matrix and architecture builds upon the concept of conformed dimensions -  creating a structure of common dimensions that ideally can be used across the enterprise by all business processes related to the DW and the corresponding fact tables from which they derive their context. According to Kimball and Margy Ross's article  “Differences of Opinion”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=0OVJNEHMPRXGRQE1GHRSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=17800088 |title=Enterprise Software News, Analysis, &amp; Advice - InformationWeek |publisher=Intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''The Enterprise Data warehouse built on the bus architecture ”identifies and enforces the relationship between business process metrics (facts) and descriptive attributes (dimensions)''”.

The concept of a [[Bus (computing)|bus]] is well known in the language of [[Information Technology]], and is what reflects the conformed dimension concept in the Data Warehouse, creating the skeletal structure where all parts of a system connect, ensuring [[interoperability]] and consistency of data, and at the same time considers future expansion. This makes the conformed dimensions act as the integration ‘glue’, creating a robust backbone of the enterprise Data Warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=GMS3H4SOBFQBBQE1GHOSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=17800088&amp;pgno=2 |title=Enterprise Software News, Analysis, &amp; Advice - InformationWeek |publisher=Intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment and applicability==

In the vertical columns the groups of contextual data is found as the common, conformed dimensions.

In this way the shared dimensions are defined, as each process indicates what dimensions it applies to through the cells figure 2.&lt;ref name="Kimball" /&gt; By this definition and coordination of conformed dimensions and processes the development of the overall data DW bus architecture is realized.&lt;ref name="Kimball" /&gt; The matrix identifies the shared dimensions related to processes and fact tables, and can be a tool for planning, prioritizing what needs to be approached, coordinating implementation and communicating the importance for conformed dimensions .

Kimball extends the matrix bus in detail as seen in figure 3&lt;ref name="Kimball" /&gt;  by introducing the other steps of the Datawarehouse Methodology; The Fact tables, Granularity, and at last the description of the needed facts.  description of the fact tables, granularity and fact instances of each process, structuring and specifying what is needed across the enterprise in a more specific matter, further exemplifying how the matrix can be used as a planning tool.

The '''Financial Markets Authority''' (FMA) is the New Zealand government agency responsible for [[financial regulation]].  It is responsible for regulating all financial market participants, exchanges and the setting and enforcing of financial regulations.

==History==
{{See also|Finance company collapses, 2006-12 (New Zealand)}}
The authority was established on the 1st of May 2011 as part of the ''Financial Markets (Regulators and KiwiSaver) Bill'' which was passed by the New Zealand parliament on the 7 April 2011.  It was established in a wake of criticism over the failure of the previous regulatory regime to halt the failure of a large number of finance companies and to stem investor losses in the period between 2006 and 2010. It was introduced by Commerce Minister Simon Power as a "super regulator" whose purpose was to restore investor confidence battered by the finance company meltdown and global financial crisis. "This move is at the centre of the Government's drive to restore the confidence of mum and dad investors in our financial markets," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://fma.govt.nz/news/releases-from-the-minister-of-commerce/new-financial-watchdog-to-be-up-and-running-in-three-weeks/|title = New Financial Watchdog to Be Up and Running in Three Weeks|date = April 7, 2011|publisher = Financial Markets Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Authority took over the functions of the [[Securities Commission of New Zealand]] and Government Actuary which were disestablished, and consolidates other regulatory functions which were fragmented across the [[Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand)]]  the Companies Office and its National Enforcement Unit.&lt;ref name=threeweeks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1104/S00163/new-financial-watchdog-to-be-up-and-running-in-three-weeks.htm |title=New Financial Watchdog to Be Up and Running in Three Weeks |author=New Zealand government |publisher=scoop.co.nz |date=7 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The FMA is controlled by a board appointed by the Minister of Commerce and run by chief executive Rob Everett.  The board comprises chairman Murray Jack and members Arthur Grimes, Campbell Stuart, Mark Todd, Mary Holm, Shelley Cave, Vanessa Stoddart, and William Stevens.&lt;ref name=threeweeks/&gt;

== Priorities ==
The FMA's official website says its key statutory objective is "to promote and facilitate the development of fair, efficient, and transparent financial markets" and that it "will use the full range of its enforcement powers, targeting conduct that presents the greatest likelihood of harm to the function of open, transparent and efficient capital markets."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fma.govt.nz/fmas-role/what-we-do/how-we-regulate/enforcement-policy/ FMA Enforcement Policy], FMA website&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was established in 2011, it has been involved in legal action against [[Bridgecorp]], KA Trustee Ltd, Perpetual, [[Hanover Finance]], [[Lombard Finance]], Sean Wood, Nathans Finance, Bernard Whimp and David Ross.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fma.govt.nz/news/court-decisions/ FMA Court Decisions], FMA Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5128">The '''Financial Stability Forum''' ('''FSF''') was a group consisting of major national financial authorities such as [[finance ministry|finance ministries]], [[central bank]]ers, and international financial bodies. It was first convened in April 1999 in Washington. At the [[2009 G20 London summit]], the [[G20]] nations established an FSF successor called the [[Financial Stability Board]] with an expanded membership and broadened mandate.&lt;ref name=thing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsforum.org/press/pr_090312b.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411064057/http://www.fsforum.org/press/pr_090312b.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Forum was founded in 1999 to promote international financial stability. Its founding resulted from discussions among Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the [[G7]] countries, and a study which they commissioned.&lt;ref name="Founding"&gt;[http://www.fsforum.org/about/genesis_of_the_fsf.html Genesis of the FSF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614000000/http://www.fsforum.org/about/genesis_of_the_fsf.html |date=June 14, 2008 }}, FSF website.&lt;/ref&gt; The Forum facilitated discussion and cooperation on supervision and surveillance of financial institutions, transactions and events. FSF was managed by a small secretariat housed at the [[Bank for International Settlements]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="FSF home"&gt;[http://www.fsforum.org fsforum.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512222115/http://www.fsforum.org/ |date=2009-05-12 }}, main website.&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF membership included about a dozen nations who participate through their central banks, financial ministries and departments, and securities regulators, including: the [[United States]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]] and several other industrialized economies as well as several international economic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsforum.org/about/who_we_are.html FSF:Who we are] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614000000/http://www.fsforum.org/about/who_we_are.html |date=June 14, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the G20 summit on November 15, 2008, it was agreed that the membership of the FSF will be expanded to include emerging economies, such as China. The [[2009 G-20 London summit]] decided to establish a successor to the FSF, the [[Financial Stability Board]]. The FSB includes members of the G20 who were not members of FSF.&lt;ref name=thing/&gt;

==Meetings and actions==
The Financial Stability Forum met in [[Rome]] on 28–29 March 2008 in connection with the [[Bank for International Settlements]]. Members discussed current challenges in financial markets, and various policy options to address them from this point forward.&lt;ref name="BIS 0308"&gt;[http://www.bis.org/press/p080329.htm Financial Stability Forum meets in Rome], 29 March 2008, Press release, Website of [[Bank for International Settlements]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At this meeting, the FSF discussed a report to be delivered to [[G7]] Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in April 2008. it identifies key weaknesses underlying current financial turmoil, and recommends actions to improve market and institutional resilience. The FSF discussed work underway at the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] with regard to [[sovereign wealth fund]]s (SWFs). The IMF is working closely with SWFs to identify a set of voluntary best practice guidelines, and is focusing on the governance, institutional arrangements and transparency of SWFs.&lt;ref name="BIS 0308"/&gt;

On April 12, 2008, the FSF delivered a [https://web.archive.org/web/20080724030541/http://www.fsforum.org/publications/FSF_Report_to_G7_11_April.pdf report] to the G7 Finance Ministers which details out its recommendations for enhancing the resilience of the financial markets and financial institutions. These are in five areas:
*Strengthened prudential oversight of capital, liquidity and risk management 
* Enhancing transparency and valuation 
* Changes in the role and uses of [[credit rating]]s
* Strengthening the authorities' responsiveness to risks 
* Robust arrangements for dealing with stress in the financial system [http://www.bis.org/press/p080412.htm]

==Inorganic fluorides==

About 3&amp;nbsp;kg (6.5&amp;nbsp;lb) of metspar grade fluorite, added directly to the batch, are used for every metric ton of steel made. The fluoride ions from CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lower the melt's temperature and [[viscosity]] (make the liquid runnier). The calcium content has a tangential benefit in removing sulfur and phosphorus, but other additives such as [[Lime (material)|lime]] are still needed. Metspar is similarly used in cast iron production and for other iron-containing alloys.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Fluorspar|author=Miller, M. Michael|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|year=2003|pages=27.1–27.12|title=U.S. Geological Survey Minerals Yearbook|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/fluorspar/fluormyb03.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluorite of the acidspar grade is used directly as an additive to ceramics and enamels, glass fibers and clouded glass, and cement, as well as in the outer coating of welding rods.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt; Acidspar is primarily used for making hydrofluoric acid, which is a [[Reaction intermediate|chemical intermediate]] for most fluorine-containing compounds. Significant direct uses of HF include [[Pickling (metal)|pickling]] (cleaning) of steel, [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking of alkanes]] in the petrochemical industry, and etching of glass.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;

[[File:Cryolite extraction of aluminium (labeled-en).svg|thumb|250px|Aluminium smelting process: cryolite (a fluoride) is required to dissolve alumnium oxide.]]

One third of HF (one sixth of mined fluorine) is used to make synthetic cryolite ([[sodium hexafluoroaluminate]]) and [[aluminium fluoride|aluminium trifluoride]]. These compounds are used in the electrolysis of aluminium by the [[Hall–Héroult process]]. About 23&amp;nbsp;kg (51&amp;nbsp;lb) are required for every metric ton of aluminium. These compounds are also used as a flux for glass.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;

[[Fluorosilicate]]s are the next most significant inorganic fluorides formed from HF. The most common one, that of sodium, is used for water fluoridation, as an intermediate for synthetic cryolite and [[silicon tetrafluoride]], and for treatment of effluents in laundries.{{sfn|Aigueperse et al.|2005|p=33}}

[[MgF2|MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and, to a lesser extent, other [[Alkaline earth metal|alkaline earth]] difluorides are specialty optical materials.{{sfn|Aigueperse et al.|2005|pp=25–26}} Magnesium difluoride is widely used as an [[antireflection coating]] for spectacles and optical equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Practical equipment, materials, and processes for optical thin films|author=Willey, Ronald R.|page=113|isbn=9780615143972|publisher=Willey Optical|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound is also a component in newly devised constructions ([[negative index metamaterials]]) which are the subject of "invisibility" research.

Other inorganic fluorides made in large quantities include [[cobalt difluoride]] (for organofluorine synthesis), [[nickel difluoride]] (electronics), [[lithium fluoride]] (a flux), [[sodium fluoride]] (water fluoridation), [[potassium fluoride]] (flux), and [[ammonium fluoride]] (various).&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt; Sodium and potassium [[bifluoride]]s are significant to the chemical industry.{{sfn|Aigueperse et al.|2005|pp=26–27}}

==Fluorocarbons==

Making organic fluorides is the main use for hydrofluoric acid, consuming over 40% of it (over 20% of all mined fluorite). Within organofluorides, refrigerant gases are still the dominant segment, consuming about 80% of HF. Even though chlorofluorocarbons are widely banned, the replacement refrigerants are often other fluorinated molecules. Fluoropolymers are less than one quarter the size of refrigerant gases in terms of fluorine usage, but are growing faster.&lt;ref name="GIA f-chem report description"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt; Fluorosurfactants are a small segment in mass but are significant economically because of very high prices.

===Gases===

{{See also|Refrigerant}}

Traditionally chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were the predominant fluorinated organic chemical. CFCs are identified by a system of numbering that explains the amount of fluorine, chlorine, carbon and hydrogen in the molecules. The term Freon has been colloquially used for CFCs and similar halogenated molecules, though strictly speaking this is just a DuPont brand name, and many other producers exist. Brand neutral terminology is to use "R" as the prefix. Prominent CFCs included R-11 ([[trichlorofluoromethane]]), R-12 ([[dichlorodifluoromethane]]), and R-114 ([[1,2-dichlorotetrafluoroethane]]).&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;

[[File:US Navy 030515-N-1512S-040 Machinist^rsquo,s Mate 3rd Class Daniel Griffin wipes down Halon 1301 bottles in the aft main machinery room aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge (LHD 3).jpg|alt=A sailor in coveralls wipes down red gas bottles|A Halon fire suppression system in a ship's machinery room|thumb|250px]]

Production of CFCs grew strongly through the 1980s, primarily for refrigeration and air conditioning but also for propellants and solvents. Since the end use of these materials is banned in most countries, this industry has shrunk dramatically. By the early 21st century, production of CFCs was less than 10% of the mid-1980s peak, with remaining use primarily as an intermediate for other chemicals. The banning of CFCs initially depressed the overall demand for fluorite but 21st century production of the source mineral has recovered to 1980s levels.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;

Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) now serve as replacements for CFC refrigerants; few were commercially manufactured before 1990. Currently more than 90% of fluorine used for organics goes into these two classes (in about equal amounts). Prominent HCFCs include R-22 ([[chlorodifluoromethane]]) and R-141b ([[1,1-Dichloro-1-fluoroethane|1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane]]). The main HFC is R-134a ([[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane|1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane]]).&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;

A bromofluoroalkane, "Halon" ([[bromotrifluoromethane]]) is still widely used in ship and aircraft [[gaseous fire suppression]] systems. Because Halon production has been banned since 1994, systems are dependent on the pre-ban stores and on recycling.&lt;ref name="Fire suppresion substitutes"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5744&amp;page=1|chapter=Executive summary|title=Fire suppression substitutes and alternatives to Halon for U.S. Navy applications|page=1|publisher=National Academies Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-309-07492-6|author=Committee on Assessment of Fire Suppression Substitutes and Alternatives to Halon (Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and Applications, National Research Council)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new type of Fluorine refrigerant, that is scoped to replace the high Global Warming Potential HFC compounds, are [[Hydrofluoroolefin|Hydrofluoroolefins]] (HFO).

===Fluoropolymers===

{{Main|Fluoropolymer}}

Fluoropolymers are less than 0.1% of all polymers produced in terms of weight. Compared to other polymers, they are more expensive and their consumption is growing at a higher rate. As of about 2006–2007, estimates of the global fluoropolymer production varied from over 100,000 to 180,000&amp;nbsp;metric&amp;nbsp;tons per year. Yearly revenue estimates ranged from over $2.5 billion to over $3.5 billion.&lt;!--|The over $3.5 billion is based on NA at 40% of global and US at $1.4 billion within the Freedonia sources. --&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedonia FP market"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fluoropolymers to 2013 – Demand and sales forecasts, market share, market size, market leaders (Abstract for market report)|url=http://www.freedoniagroup.com/Fluoropolymers.html|publisher=Freedonia Group|accessdate=10 November 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yearly FP production"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buznik | first1 = V.

Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is 60–80% of the world's fluoropolymer production on a weight basis.&lt;ref name="yearly FP production"/&gt; The term Teflon is sometimes used generically for the substance, but is a Chemours Company and Dupont brand name—other PTFE producers exist and Chemours sometimes uses the Teflon brand for other materials. PTFE gets its fluorine without the need for fluorine gas: [[chloroform]] (trichloromethane) is treated with HF to make chlorodifluoromethane (R-22, an HFC); this chemical when heated makes [[tetrafluoroethylene]] (abbreviated TFE), the monomer of PTFE.&lt;ref name="encyc of structure"/&gt;

The largest application for PTFE is in [[electrical insulation]]. It is an excellent [[dielectric]] and very chemically stable. It is also used extensively in the chemical process industry where corrosion resistance is needed: in coating pipes, in tubing, and [[gasket]]s. Another major use is [[Fabric structure|architectural fabric]] (PTFE-coated fiberglass cloth used for stadium roofs and such). The major consumer application is [[Non-stick surface|non-stick]] cookware.&lt;ref name="encyc of structure"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=John Wilson|title=Concise encyclopedia of the structure of materials|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-045127-5|pages=187–194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xv420pEC2qMC&amp;pg=PA189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When stretched with a jerk, a PTFE film makes a fine-pored [[Artificial membrane|membrane]]: expanded PTFE ([[ePTFE]]). The term "[[Gore-Tex]]" is sometimes used generically for this material, but that is a specific brand name. [[W.L. Gore &amp; Associates]] is not the only producer of ePTFE and furthermore "Gore-Tex" often refers to more complicated multi-layer membranes or [[laminated fabric]]s. ePTFE is used in rainwear, [[Personal protective equipment|protective apparel]] and [[filtration|liquids and gas filters]]. PTFE can also be formed into [[PTFE fiber|fibers]] which are used in [[seal (mechanical)|pump packing seals]] and [[Dust collector|bag house filters]] for industries with corrosive exhausts.&lt;ref name="encyc of structure"/&gt;

Other fluoropolymers tend to have similar properties to PTFE—high chemical resistance and good dielectric properties—which leads to use in the chemical process industry and electrical insulation. They are easier to work with (to form into complex shapes), but are more expensive than PTFE and have lower thermal stability. [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene]] (FEP) is the second most produced fluoropolymer. Films from two different fluoropolymers serve as glass-replacements in solar cells.&lt;ref name="encyc of structure"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Altenergy&gt;{{cite web|last=Bhiwankar|first=Nikhil|title=Weathering the storm: Fluoropolymer films protect solar modules and ensure performance|publisher=altenergymag.com|year=2011|url=http://www.altenergymag.com/emagazine/2011/10/weathering-the-storm-fluoropolymer-films-protect-solar-modules-and-ensure-performance/1800|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DeBergalis&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeBergalis|first=Michael|title=Fluoropolymer films in the photovoltaic industry|journal=Journal of Fluorine Chemistry|year=2004|volume=125|pages=1255–1257|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Photovoltaics/en_US/assets/downloads/pdf/DeBergalis_flpr_films_wp.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jfluchem.2004.05.013|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;



Fluorinated [[ionomer]]s (polymers that include charged fragments) are expensive, chemically resistant materials used as membranes in certain electrochemical cells. [[Nafion]], developed in the 1960s, was the first example and remains the most prominent material in the class. The initial Nafion application was as a fuel cell material in spacecraft. Since then, the material has been transforming the 55&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;tons per year [[chloralkali]] industry; it is replacing hazardous mercury-based cells with membrane cells that are also more energy efficient. While older technology plants continue to run, new plants typically use membrane cells. By 2002, more than a third of the global capacity for the industry was membrane-cell based. Recently, the fuel cell application has reemerged; significant research is being conducted and investments made related to getting [[proton exchange membrane]] (PEM) fuel cells into vehicles.&lt;ref name="Fluorinated Ionomers"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grot|first=Walter|title=Fluorinated ionomers|year=2011|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-1-4377-4457-6|pages=1–10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E8H1Hwd5GXUC&amp;pg=PA6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Functional Materials"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramkumar|first=Jayshreee|title=Functional materials: Preparation, processing and applications|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-12-385142-0|pages=549–578|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ep7U5G4O3mQC&amp;pg=PA567|editor=Banerjee, S|chapter=Nafion Persulphonate Membrane: Unique Properties and Various Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chlor-alkali and chlorate technology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burney|first=H.

[[Fluoroelastomer]]s are rubber-like substances that are composed of [[crosslink]]ed mixtures of fluoropolymers. [[Viton]] is a prominent example. Chemical-resistant [[O-ring]]s are the primary application. Fluoroelastomers tend to be more stiff than conventional elastomers, but with superior chemical and heat resistance.&lt;ref name="encyc of structure"/&gt;

===Surfactants===

[[File:A water droplet DWR-coated surface2 edit1.jpg|thumb|alt=A shiny spherical drop of water on blue cloth.|Drop of water on a fabric treated with fluorinated surfactant]]

{{Main|Fluorinated surfactant|Durable water repellent}}

Fluorinated surfactants are small organofluorine molecules, principally used in durable water repellent (DWR). Fluorosurfactants form a large market, over $1 billion per year as of 2006. [[Scotchgard]] is a prominent brand, with over $300 million revenue in 2000.&lt;ref name="fluorosurfactant market"/&gt; Fluorosurfactants are expensive chemicals, comparable to pharmaceutical chemicals: $200–2000 per kilogram ($90–900 per pound).&lt;ref name="Fluorinated surfactants"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kissa|first=Erik|title=Fluorinated surfactants and repellents|year=2001|publisher=Marcel Dekker|isbn=0-8247-0472-X|pages=516–551|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iAmE8v3bFnUC&amp;pg=PA522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluorosurfactants make a very small part of the [[surfactant|overall surfactant market]], most of which is hydrocarbon based and much cheaper. Some potential applications (e.g. [[Surfactants in paint|low cost paints]]) are unable to use fluorosurfactants because of the price impact of compounding in even small amounts of fluorosurfactant. Use in paints was only about $100 million as of 2006.&lt;ref name="fluorosurfactant market"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Renner, R. |title=The long and the short of perfluorinated replacements |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=40 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pmid=16433328 |doi=10.1021/es062612a |pages=12–3|bibcode = 2006EnST...40...12R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DWR is a [[Finishing (textiles)|finish]] (very thin coating) put on fabrics that makes them lightly rain resistant, that makes water bead. First developed in the 1950s, fluorosurfactants were 90% of the DWR industry by 1990. DWR is used with garment fabrics, carpeting, and food packaging. DWR is applied to fabrics by "dip-squeeze-dry" (immersion in DWR-water bath, pressing water out, and then drying).&lt;ref name="Ullman fibers"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ullman|first=Fritz|title=Ullmann's fibers: Textile and dyeing technologies, high performance and optical fibers|volume=2|year=2008|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=978-3-527-31772-1|pages=538, 543–547|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKBKwGV5rSsC&amp;pg=PA543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluorine gas==

For countries with available data (free-market countries), about 17,000&amp;nbsp;metric&amp;nbsp;tons of fluorine are produced per year by 11 companies, all [[G7]]-resident.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|p=12}} Fluorine is relatively inexpensive, costing about $5–8 per kilogram ($2–4 per pound) when sold as uranium hexafluoride or sulfur hexafluoride. Because of difficulties in storage and handling, the price of pure fluorine gas is much higher.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|p=12}} Processes demanding large amounts of fluorine gas generally [[vertical integration|vertically integrate]] and produce the gas onsite for direct use.

[[File:Uranium hexafluoride crystals sealed in an ampoule.jpg|Uranium hexafluoride in sealed tube|thumb]]

The largest application for elemental fluorine is the preparation of [[uranium hexafluoride]], which is used in the production of [[nuclear fuel]]s. To obtain the compound, [[uranium dioxide]] is first treated with hydrofluoric acid, to produce [[uranium tetrafluoride]]. This compound is then further fluorinated by direct exposure to fluorine gas to make the hexafluoride.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|p=12}} Fluorine's monoisotopic natural occurrence makes it useful in [[uranium enrichment]], because uranium hexafluoride molecules will differ in mass only because of mass differences between uranium-235 and uranium-238. These mass differences are used to separate uranium-235 and uranium-238 via diffusion and centrifugation.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt; Up to 7,000&amp;nbsp;metric&amp;nbsp;tons per year of fluorine gas are used for this application.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|p=12}}  As of 2013, 686,500 metric tons of  UF6, containing about 470,000 metric tons of [[depleted uranium]] (the remainder being fluorine), were stored at the [[Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant]], the [[United States Enrichment Corporation|USEC's Piketon site, Ohio]] and the [[East Tennessee Technology Park]] (formerly known as the K-25 Site).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq16.cfm |title= How much depleted uranium hexafluoride is stored in the United States? |author=Depleted UF6 Management Information Network   |work=web.ead.anl.gov |year=2013 |accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second largest application for fluorine gas is [[sulfur hexafluoride]], which is used as a dielectric medium in high voltage switching stations. SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; gas has a much higher dielectric strength than air. It is extremely inert and, compared to oil-filled switchgear, has no hazardous [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs). Sulfur hexafluoride is also used in soundproof windows, in the electronics industry, as well as niche medical and military applications. The compound can be made without using fluorine gas, but the reaction between pure sulfur and pure fluorine gas, first developed by Henri Moissan, remains the commercial practice. About 6,000&amp;nbsp;metric&amp;nbsp;tons per year of fluorine gas are consumed.{{sfn|Aigueperse et al.|2005|p=35}}

Several compounds made from elemental fluorine serve the electronics industry. Rhenium and tungsten hexafluorides are used for [[chemical vapor deposition]] of thin metal films onto semiconductors. [[Tetrafluoromethane]], is used for [[plasma etching]] in [[semiconductor]] manufacturing, [[flat panel display]] production, and [[microelectromechanical systems]] fabrication.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|pp=11–12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Wg1SnT6Cb0QC&amp;pg=PA317|page = 317|chapter = Fluorine –Based Plasmas|title = Fundamentals of semiconductor processing technology|isbn = 978-0-7923-9534-8|last = El-Kareh|first = Badih|year = 1994|accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = Leonel R.|last1 = Arana|first2 = Nuria|last2 = de Mas|first3 = Aleksander J.|last3 = Schmidt|last4 = Franz|first4 = Martin A. |first5 =Schmidt F. |last5 =Jensen |first6 = Klaus F. |last6 =Jensen|doi = 10.1088/0960-1317/17/2/026|title = Isotropic etching of silicon in fluorine gas for MEMS micromachining|journal= Journal Micromechanical Microenergy|year = 2007|volume = 17|page = 384|issue = 2|bibcode = 2007JMiMi..17..384A}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nitrogen trifluoride]] is increasingly used for cleaning equipment at display manufacturing plants. Elemental fluorine, itself, is used sometimes for cleaning equipment.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;

For making niche organofluorines and fluorine-containing pharmaceuticals, direct fluorination is usually too hard to control. Preparation of intermediate strength fluorinators from fluorine gas solves this problem. The halogen fluorides ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, BrF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and IF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; provide gentler fluorination, with a series of strengths. They are also easier to handle. Sulfur tetrafluoride is used particularly for making fluorinated pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;

United States and Soviet space scientists in the early 1960s studied elemental fluorine as a possible [[rocket fuel|rocket propellant]] because of the higher [[specific impulse]] generated when fluorine replaced oxygen in combustion. The experiments failed because fluorine proved difficult to handle, and its combustion product (typically hydrogen fluoride) was extremely toxic and corrosive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher=The Rand Corporation|accessdate=31 February 2011|last = Krieger|first=F.

==Production of fluorine gas==
[[File:Fluorine cell room.jpg|thumb|300px|Fluorine cell room at F2 Chemicals, [[City of Preston, Lancashire|Preston, England]].|alt=A machine room]]

Commercial producers of fluorine gas continue to use the method of electrolysis pioneered by Moissan, with some modifications in the cell design. Owing to the gas's corrosiveness, special containment materials and handling precautions are required. Chemical routes to the elemental form were published in 1986.

===Electrolytic synthesis===

Several thousand metric tons of elemental fluorine are produced annually by electrolysis of potassium bifluoride in hydrogen fluoride.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt; Potassium bifluoride forms spontaneously from potassium fluoride and the hydrogen fluoride:

:HF + KF → KHF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

A mixture with the approximate composition KF•2HF melts at 70&amp;nbsp;°C (158&amp;nbsp;°F) and is electrolyzed between 70&amp;nbsp;°C and 130&amp;nbsp;°C (160–265&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="ModFcchem"/&gt; Potassium bifluoride increases the electrical conductivity of the solution and provides the bifluoride anion, which releases fluorine at the anode (negative part of the cell). If HF alone is electrolyzed, hydrogen forms at the cathode (positive part of the cell) and the fluoride ions remain in solution. After electrolysis, potassium fluoride remains in solution.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|pp=4–5}}

:2 HF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑ + F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑ + 2 F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The modern version of the process uses steel containers as cathodes, while blocks of carbon are used as anodes. The carbon electrodes are similar to those used in the electrolysis of aluminium. An earlier version of fluorine production process, by Moissan, uses [[platinum group]] metal [[electrode]]s and carved fluorite containers. The voltage for the electrolysis is between 8 and 12&amp;nbsp;volts.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|p=6}}

===Handling===

[[File:Laboratory apparatus for reactions with fluorine gas.jpg|thumb|Laboratory setup for fluorine reactions, [[University of Freiburg]]]]

Pure fluorine gas may be stored in steel cylinders where the inside surface is passivated by a metal fluoride layer that resists further attack.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|pp=4–5}}&lt;ref name="ModFcchem"/&gt; Passivated steel will withstand fluorine provided the temperature is kept below 200&amp;nbsp;°C (400&amp;nbsp;°F). Above that temperature, nickel is required. Regulator valves are made of nickel. Fluorine piping is generally made of nickel or [[Monel]] (nickel-copper alloy).{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|pp=10–11}} Care must be taken to passivate all surfaces frequently and to exclude any water or greases. In the laboratory, fluorine gas can be used in glass tubing provided the pressure is low and moisture is excluded,{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|pp=10–11}} although some sources recommend systems made of nickel, Monel, and PTFE.&lt;ref name="Shriver Inorganic"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shriver|first1=Duward|last2=Atkins|first2=Peter|title=Solutions manual for inorganic chemistry|year=2010|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4292-5255-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWKuqaeYXSEC&amp;pg=PA427|page=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical routes===
In 1986, when preparing for a conference to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the discovery of fluorine, [[Karl O. Christe]] discovered a purely chemical preparation of fluorine gas; however, he stated in his work that the basics were known 50 years before the actual reaction.&lt;ref name=Kirsch2004&gt;{{Cite book | title = Modern fluoroorganic chemistry: Synthesis, reactivity, applications | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aZoQP2YFsakC&amp;pg=PA7 | year = 2004 | author = Kirsch, Peer | page = 7 | isbn = 3-527-30691-9 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main idea is that some metal fluoride anions do not have a neutral counterpart (or those are very unstable) and their acidifying would result in chemical oxidation, rather than formation of the expected molecules. Christe lists the following reactions as a possible way:

:2&amp;nbsp;[[KMnO4|KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2&amp;nbsp;[[Potassium fluoride|KF]] + 10&amp;nbsp;[[Hydrogen fluoride|HF]] + 3&amp;nbsp;[[H2O2|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → 2&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 8&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 3&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑
:2&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[hexafluoromanganate|MnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 4&amp;nbsp;[[SbF5|SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] → 4&amp;nbsp;K[[Hexafluoroantimonate|SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2&amp;nbsp;[[MnF3|MnF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑

This synthetic route is a rare chemical preparation of elemental fluorine, a reaction not previously thought possible.&lt;ref name='year'&gt;{{cite journal|author = Christe, K.|journal= [[Inorganic Chemistry (journal)|Inorganic Chemistry]]|volume = 25|pages = 3721–3724|doi = 10.1021/ic00241a001|title = Chemical synthesis of elemental fluorine|year = 1986|issue = 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Innovations ==
The company has innovated the UPrep column&lt;ref&gt;Campa, Michael (2007). UPrep Universal Spin Filter Column. Retrieved March 19, 2008 from [http://www.biocompare.com/review/672/UPrep-Universal-Spin-Filter-Column-From-Genesee-Scientific.htmlBiocompare Biocompare]&lt;/ref&gt; used in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) purification. The idea behind the UPrep column, is that most, if not all, nucleic acid purification or clean-up kits come equipped with 10-15% more reagent volume than is actually needed for the number of columns the kit contains. This means that for a kit with 100 columns, you end up with enough reagent for another 10 to 15 preps after you run out of columns. Normally, this excess reagent is tossed out. UPrep columns allow you to use this extra reagent for additional preps.

Genesee Scientific has also been responsible for developing Blue Devil autoradiography film&lt;ref&gt;Dell, Emily A., Bowman, Daniel, Rufty,Thomas, Shi, Wei. "Intensive Management Affects Composition of Betaproteobacterial Ammonia Oxidizers in Turfgrass Systems." ''Microbial Ecology.'' October 14, 2007. Accessed on April 21, 2008 from [http://www.springerlink.com/content/rt7602j473802621 SpringerLink]&lt;/ref&gt; which produces exceptional clarity and sharpness with extremely low backgrounds. Blue Devil Film is used for blotting, sequencing, chemiluminescent autoradiography (ecl) and gel shift analysis. It is designed for use with 14C, 35S, 32P, and 125I.

=== ''Drosophila'' Research ===
Genesee Scientific is the world leader in innovation for and supply to the ''[[Drosophila]]'' (fruit fly) research community. ''[[Drosophila]]'' are widely used as a model organism in the field of genetics.

Genesee Scientific has been awarded three patents by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] for its revolutionary ''[[Drosophila]]'' vial racking system (patent numbers D673,296 S; 8,136,679 B2; and 8,430,251 B2). This ''[[Drosophila]]'' vial racking system significantly decreases time spent racking vials and is more environmentally friendly compared to traditional vial packaging configurations.

Genesee Scientific has also developed the first atlas of ''[[Drosophila]]'' phenotypic markers available on mobile devices. Genesee the ''[[Drosophila]]'' App is a free tool providing researchers with a quick reference to various ''[[Drosophila]]'' [[phenotypes]] and is a valuable teaching tool for new ''[[Drosophila]]'' researchers.

When Ivan was a young boy his parents changed the family name to Ivanović and converted to [[Catholicism]], along with many other [[Jews]] at the time.

After completing his early studies his parents sent him to [[Vienna]] where he became a [[Doctor of Law]]. In 1905 he became one of the founders of the Croatian National Progressive Party ({{lang|hr|Hrvatska narodna napredna stranka}}, NNS).&lt;ref name="SD-2002-09"&gt;{{cite news | language = Croatian | url = http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20020905/temedana03.asp | title = Tko je bio dr.

In 1918, as a member of the National Assembly of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes he helped to form the state.

In 1929, Ivanović built an [[oil refinery]] in Osijek named "IPOIL". In 1936, he started building the first [[aluminum]] factory in the [[Balkans]] in the town of [[Lozovac]] near [[Šibenik]], consulted by [[Elektrokemisk]],&lt;ref name="SD-2002-07"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20020725/sibenik04.asp | language = Croatian | newspaper = [[Slobodna Dalmacija]] | title = Centar hrvatske aluminijske industrije | quote = Tvornicu aluminija u Lozovcu 1936. počeo je graditi dr.

During the [[Second World War]] he was arrested and imprisoned for three years.&lt;ref name="SD-2002-09"/&gt; His first factory, IPOIL, was confiscated by the [[Independent State of Croatia]]. His second factory, IVANAL, was confiscated by the Italian occupying forces.&lt;ref name="SD-2002-09"/&gt; In 1946, the [[Communists]] accused him of being a "[[capitalist]] [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]" and in a plotted political process,&lt;ref name="SD-2002-09"/&gt; the [[Supreme Court of Croatia]] in [[Zagreb]] (case No. K-645/45 of 9 January) condemned both him and his wife and confiscated all the property of the company, including all the immovables and factory buildings. Ivanović was stripped of his [[civil rights]] and sent to a forced [[labor camp]].&lt;ref name="SD-2002-09"/&gt; After being released, he fled to [[Italy]] where he died in [[Genoa]] in 1949 aged 68.&lt;ref name="SD-2002-09"/&gt;

He and Milica Popovic had three children together, [[Vane Ivanović|Ivan]], [[Daška Ivanović|Daška]] and Vladimir. He had a third son named Dimitar with his second wife Jelka Muačević. In 1948, his third wife, Štefica Kastelic, gave birth to his fourth son, Marko, who became his legal successor.&lt;ref name="History of IVANAL"/&gt;

'''John Clarence Drinkle''' (born 1878 in [[Waverley, Ontario]]) was one of [[Saskatoon]]’s foremost boomtown entrepreneurs.  He arrived in 1903 at age 25 with less than $500 and quickly made himself possibly the richest man in town.

==Early years==
John Clarence Drinkle was born in Waverly, Ontario in 1878 where he received his early business training as a retail clerk.  He moved to [[Winnipeg]] in 1898, where a disastrous business venture early in his career drained his capital and left him in debt.  From 1901 to 1903 he worked as a salesman for Salada Tea Company to pay off his debts.  At age 25 he teamed up with F.E. Kerr, a business school friend, and with a combined total capital of $500 they set off for Saskatoon, [[Saskatchewan]] to set up a real estate office.

During Saskatoon’s first boom period everyone was speculating in real estate.  The relatively poor were often made wealthy in a very short time - Drinkle may have been the most extreme example.  He arrived in 1903 at age 25 with less than $500, when Saskatoon was a dirt street town of barely 500 people.  Only ten years later it had a population of 28,000 and was described as "the fastest growing city in the world".  By then Drinkle was a multi-millionaire and probably the richest man in town.

Drinkle was married twice during his early Saskatoon years, then was married again in the 1940s.  He is said to have spent so much time on business that he had limited time for family. One marriage reportedly ended with his wife returning home to New York after having had an affair with Drinkle’s chauffeur.  Beginning in 1911 Drinkle and his wife, Jane Godden, lived primarily in London, England where they had four children.  They travelled extensively, steaming around the world three times, and were reported to have lived in a very high style. It was during this time that Drinkle began selling many of his Saskatoon properties, including his mansion on Avenue A in 1912.

==Firsts==
Drinkle loved technology and was one of Saskatoon’s most innovative early leaders.  He installed Saskatoon’s first automatic telephone system in 1907, one of the first on the continent. He started Saskatoon’s first modern steam laundry, and oversaw the "largest and finest furniture store West of Winnipeg". Drinkle has been credited with bringing the first car to Saskatoon, which he used to show real estate to prospective clients.  He built the "first substantial business block fit for a large metropolis",&lt;ref&gt;Don Kerr and Stan Hanson, Saskatoon: The First Half Century, NeWest Press c.1982&lt;/ref&gt; complete with the first elevator, and built for himself a modern house described as "one of the most beautiful homes in the entire province".&lt;ref&gt;Norman Fergus Black, The History of Saskatchewan and the Old North West (Regina: north West Historical Company, ca. 1913), p424-428.&lt;/ref&gt;  His company was one of the first to buy vast tracts of land on speculation for resale to farmers, and this was the early base of his fortune.

==Drinkle No. 1==
Drinkle startled the community in 1906 when he commenced the erection of the first large brick office building in town.  Saskatoon’s architecture at the time was humble, but Drinkle’s design was worthy of a large metropolis. It was designed by [[Walter William LaChance|W.W. LaChance]], Saskatoon’s first resident architect.

The building was completed in 1909, and was located on the Southwest corner of 2nd Avenue and 21st Street, which was the former site of his Great West Furniture Store. The four-storey concrete and brick structure had Saskatoon’s first lift elevator.  It was called the "mercantile mansion" and the "grandest building West of Winnipeg:.  Drinkle moved his furniture store into the building as its first tenant, occupying {{convert|40000|sqft|m2}}. The top floor was used as the first home for the University of Saskatchewan for two years, before the campus was built.  Students boasted that theirs was the only university in Canada with a lift elevator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| vauthors =| title =Documenting Saskatchewan - J C Drinkle Building| work =| publisher =[[University of Saskatchewan]]| year =1997| url =http://library2.usask.ca/90th/1900/1909.html| doi =| accessdate =2009-02-23}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drinkle No. 1 was consumed by fire on January 24, 1925.  It housed MacMillan Department Store at the time. The janitor, Thomas Simmons, nearly lost his life making a heroic effort to rescue his wife who perished in the blaze.  He was rescued by fire chief John Faithfull after falling unconscious from the fumes.  Two days later the last flames were extinguished, but the search for his wife’s body could not be resumed until the remaining walls were knocked down.

== Drinkle No. 2 ==
Completed in July, 1913, at the end of the boom period, Drinkle No. 2 was designed by Robert S. Byers and constructed by Frid-Lewis Contractors at a reported cost of $60,000.  Over the years it housed many street level stores including: Colliers Music, Brown’s Delicatessen, Sherwin Williams, Meedwill Radio, National Cash Register, and The Crown and Anchor bar.  Drinkle No. 2 caught fire on the night of May 19, 1986.  When the fire department arrived flames were already coming through the roof and windows.  Unable to get inside, the firefighters were limited to using equipment to prevent the fire from spreading to either the Saskatoon Credit Union or the Ross Block next to it to the south.  No one was injured in the fire, but the businesses that occupied it lost their stock and were forced to relocate.

==Drinkle No. 3==
[[File:City of Saskatoon - Drinkle No 3 Building - October 2009.jpg|thumb|Drinkle No. 3 building at night.]]
Known as Regent Plaza since 1976, Drinkle No. 3 was Drinkle’s most ambitious project.  When the boom was in full stride, all eyes were on 3rd Avenue.  The street was described as the site of "probably the greatest development ever seen at one time on any street in Canada". The city founders envisioned 3rd Avenue as Saskatoon’s greatest metropolitan street.  Drinkle envisioned this building, then named Drinkle No. 3, as his greatest achievement and the tallest, finest building in the city. Ultimately, both visions were only half fulfilled. It was designed as a fireproof five story steel-reinforced concrete and brick office building, complete with high speed elevators and marble corridors trimmed with quarter-cut oak. In 1913, after five floors had been built, Drinkle announced his intention to add an additional five floors, making it the tallest building in Saskatoon. Its architects intended the façade of the top two floors to be treated with decorative terra cotta to draw one’s eye to the grand cornice. Drinkle planned a rooftop garden similar to one he had admired in a Vancouver building. The projected cost of the ten story structure was $450,000.  The construction of the additional five floors was delayed in the winter of 1913, reportedly due to a shortage of steel.  The onset of "the bust" eventually put a stop to construction and the remaining five floors, cornice, decorative terra cotta, and the marble lined corridors were never built. The building was never used for offices and was converted to residential use in 1919.

In 1923 Drinkle 3 was expanded to approximately 100 suites, and then was remodeled in the 1980s to have 60.  Commercial tenants through the years have included Buckwold’s, General Motors, Firestone, Gassy Jax, The Gazebo, Custom Stereo, Macho, The Partnership, Lucci’s, Sardi’s, Muffin Break, Lee’s Vietnamese, Tarragon, and The Publican.  In 1977 the building nearly burned when a fire at Gassy Jax caused $400,000 damage, killing palms and canaries housed in the store.

==Legacy==
Drinkle continued at least two entrepreneurial endeavors in Saskatoon in the years after the bust, but neither were successful.  Perhaps his temperament was ill-suited for the post-war business and political climate, which was so different from the exuberance of the boom years.  Although Drinkle lost his Saskatoon assets to receivership, he seems to have preserved some of his wealth, possibly due to his having liquidated many of his properties starting two years before the bust. He is reported to have lived in an extravagant lifestyle in London for ten years after the bust. It is unclear what his activities in London were during that time, but in 1920 he and his family returned to Saskatoon broke and ready to start over. He took over the Saskatoon Pure Milk Company, with the support of his brother William, and adapted its operation to conform with new pasteurization regulations.  However, this business went into receivership in 1926, and led to a falling out with his brother.  It appears that Drinkle left Saskatoon not long after and did not return until about 1939 when he established the Drinkle Canning and Preserving Company at 215 22nd St W, near the site of his original laundry.  This company operated in relative obscurity until the early 1940s when he married his third wife, Loretta Rose, and moved to Ottawa. With the help of his wife, he managed to secure a military contract to provide marmalade to Canadian forces during WWII.  He was unable to source ingredients during wartime and reportedly had to adapt by making marmalade from cabbage.  He was still making commercial jams, from the basement of his home in Ottawa, when he died at age 73.

Drinkle died in his home in 1951 and his remains were interred at Waverly Ontario, his childhood home.  His body arrived there by train, unbeknownst to his remaining distant relatives, who were required to pay the freight before collecting the remains.  Today a large monument marks his grave.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2422">A '''labor market area''' is a geographic area or region defined for purposes of compiling, reporting, and evaluating [[employment]], [[unemployment]], [[workforce]] availability, and related topics. It can be defined as an economically integrated region within which residents can find jobs within a reasonable commuting distance or can change their employment without changing their place of residence.&lt;ref name=LMAsBLS2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/lau/lmadir.pdf |title=Labor Market Areas, 2013 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics |date=March 2013 |page=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Commuting]] flows are a primary consideration in defining and delineating labor market areas. The extent to which workers are willing and able to commute between two places indicates the degree of economic integration between those places.&lt;ref name=SmallCriteriaBLS2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/lau/lmadir.pdf |title=Appendix II. Criteria for Designating Small Labor Market Areas |work=Labor Market Areas, 2013 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics |date=March 2013 |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS) maintains standard definitions of labor market areas for the purpose of standardization and to promote comparability of the labor force information used by various government programs. Definitions are updated annually, and the entire system of definitions is reevaluated once each decade based on decennial census data.&lt;ref name=LMAsBLS2013/&gt; BLS uses [[metropolitan statistical area|metropolitan]] and [[micropolitan statistical area]]s, including metropolitan divisions, as its principal basis for defining labor market areas. In [[New England]], labor market area definitions are based on [[New England city and town area]]s rather than the [[county (United States)|county]]-based [[statistical area (United States)|statistical areas]] used in other parts of the country. For geographic areas outside of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, the BLS identifies labor market areas based primarily on commuting data, with a requirement that all components of a labor market area be contiguous.&lt;ref name=SmallCriteriaBLS2013/&gt;

Valenstein and fellow Jews, [[Albert D. Lasker]] and [[Milton H.

Commercial [[bank]]s, credit non-bank organizations, leasing companies often act as lessors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfin.ru/management/finance/capital/leasing_deal.shtml?printversion&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

A lessor can be both [[legal entity]] and individual.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfin.ru/management/finance/capital/leasing_deal.shtml?printversion&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://taxpravo.ru/novosti/statya-151554-lizingodatel_vprave_primenyat_spetsialnyiy_koeffitsient_no_ne_vyishe_3&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the term “leasing company” sometimes is used as a synonym to the term “lessor”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.credits.ru/glossary/term/175/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211056/http://www.credits.ru/glossary/term/175/ |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seller of the property and the lessor can be one and the same person.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aup.ru/books/m191/6_1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of lessor==

The process of interaction of the lessor with other participants of the Leasing Contract is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Боровская М.А., Налесная Я.А. БАНКОВСКИЕ УСЛУГИ ПРЕДПРИЯТИЯМ. Учебно-методическое пособие. Таганрог: ТРТУ, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
#The Lessee chooses the seller who possesses the required property
#The lessor acquires this property. He acquires the property not for his own use, but specifically for assignment for temporary use.
#The lessor transfers the property to the Lessee for temporary use for an agreed payment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allpravo.ru/library/doc99p0/instrum3881/item3888.html&lt;/ref&gt;
#On completion the contract, depending on its conditions the property shall be returned to the lessor or passed into the ownership of the Lessee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.garant.ru/consult/account/519026/&lt;/ref&gt;

For the whole time period of the Leasing Contract the property is in the ownership of the lessor.&lt;ref&gt;http://bibliotekar.ru/vneshneeconomicheskaya-deyatelnost-2/231.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Боровская М.А., Налесная Я.А. БАНКОВСКИЕ УСЛУГИ ПРЕДПРИЯТИЯМ. Учебно-методическое пособие. Таганрог: ТРТУ, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfin.ru/management/finance/capital/leasing_deal.shtml?printversion&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In case of failure of reimbursements of lease payments under the schedule specified in the contract the lessor has the right to exempt the property from the Lessee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfin.ru/management/finance/capital/leasing_deal.shtml?printversion&lt;/ref&gt; In case of bankruptcy of the Lessee the lessor has the priority right for payments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfin.ru/management/finance/capital/leasing_deal.shtml?printversion&lt;/ref&gt;

If the lessor contrary to the contract has interfered with the choice of the seller or leasing subject, he bears the responsibility for non-delivery of the equipment, personal injury of citizens while using the leasing subject, damage which is caused to the property of the Lessee and the third Parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pravorggu.ru/2007_10/nseleznev_21.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140227163837/http://pravorggu.ru/2007_10/nseleznev_21.shtml |archivedate=2014-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are however exceptions from this norm.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buh.ru/document-2056&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of implementation of a high-priced project the lessor may involve into the transaction additional sources of financial assets (through banks, [[insurance company|insurance companies]], [[investment fund]]s, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Боровская М.А., Налесная Я.А. БАНКОВСКИЕ УСЛУГИ ПРЕДПРИЯТИЯМ. Учебно-методическое пособие. Таганрог: ТРТУ, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official leasing operator==

Official leasing provider (dealer) is a special type of lessor. This is the official supplier of specialized machinery, transport and equipment directly to the final consumer or through a leasing company. Official leasing operator cooperates with manufacturers (subsidiary offices) of prime machinery under the operator (dealer) agreement.

For the leasing company the official leasing operator acts as:
* official certified supplier;
* agent (provides leasing consumers – clients); 
* insurance agent and liquidator (liquidation of machinery which is free from the financial lease).

For consumers, the official leasing operator acts as:      
* official certified supplier;     
* leasing [[broker]] (selects a leasing company, which is the most relevant to the requirements of the client, based on the needs and capabilities of the client);
* advisor on optimization of vehicle park for completing of customer's project;
* advisor on improvement of the effectiveness of the company’s processes associated with the use of machinery.

==Legislation==

Rights and obligations of the lessor in the [[Russian Federation]] are regulated by the contract, under the Federal Law “On financial rent (leasing)”,&lt;ref&gt;http://base.garant.ru/12113492/2/&lt;/ref&gt; the Tax Code of the Russian Federation,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pmp.admoblkaluga.ru/content/news/federal/events/m,29,14613/&lt;/ref&gt; the Civil Code, and others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pravorggu.ru/2007_10/nseleznev_21.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140227163837/http://pravorggu.ru/2007_10/nseleznev_21.shtml |archivedate=2014-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ukraine]] – by the Law “On Financial Leasing” and many others,&lt;ref&gt;http://jurliga.ligazakon.ua/news/2010/3/23/21722.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Uzbekistan]] – by Chapter 34 of the Civil Code of Uzbekistan and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://fmc.uz/legisl.php?id=k_grajd_34_6&lt;/ref&gt; International leasing contracts are regulated under the UNIDROIT Convention on International Financial Leasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://platezhnye-karty.com/lizingodatel-nerezident-nado-li-platit-dvojnoj-nds/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228211010/http://platezhnye-karty.com/lizingodatel-nerezident-nado-li-platit-dvojnoj-nds/ |archivedate=2014-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lightning Source''' is a business unit of [[Ingram Content Group]]. The company is a printer and distributor of [[print-on-demand]] books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dougherty WC|title=Print on Demand: What Librarians Should Know|journal=[[The Journal of Academic Librarianship]]|volume=35 |issue=2|pages=184–6|date=March 2009 |pmid= |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6W50-4VNCC35-6/2/c990652b39b1fe115a30eda1dfc54ff0|doi=10.1016/j.acalib.2009.01.006}} Retrieved February 08, 2010 through [[ScienceDirect]].&lt;/ref&gt; Originally incorporated in 1996 as Lightning Print Inc., the company is headquartered in [[La Vergne, Tennessee]]. Its UK operations are based in [[Milton Keynes]].  They also have operations in Maurepas, France and Melbourne, Australia.

IngramSpark is a service operated by Lightning Source to cater for the needs of independent publishers and authors. Since it launched in 2013, IngramSpark has registered more than 7 million books, with 4,000 new books added each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Old Mate Media|url=https://oldmatemedia.com/ingramspark-interview/|title=IngramSpark Interview: Answers to your Self-Publishing Questions|date=2018-03-05|accessdate=November 17, 2018|first=Kate|last=Stead}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Espresso Book Machine==
The [[Espresso Book Machine]] 2.0 is a compact ({{convert|3.8|ft|cm}} wide by {{convert|2.7|ft|cm}} deep by {{convert|4.5|ft|cm}} high) book-printing kiosk that can be installed in a bookshop or public place to print, bind and cut books on demand while the customer waits. The EBM 2.0 can download encrypted book files from Lightning Source (LS). Publishers must specifically give permission in order for their titles to be included in the scheme.

The EBM project can theoretically allow faster access to LS print-on-demand books in regions where there is no existing LS plant, and where shipping times would otherwise create significant supply delays. It also allows large bookshops to offer their customers almost immediate access to a wider range of titles than could be held onsite. However, to date, uptake of the Espresso Book Machine system has been low.

==E-book services==
Lightning Source has an e-book supply system that can serve up protected PDF copies of books from their library through a vendor's site, if a publisher chooses to participate.

Although the scheme originally allowed electronic LS editions to be sold on Amazon alongside "conventional" print-on-demand editions, Amazon withdrew from the scheme. Lightning Source still offer their e-book on demand service to publishers who have a suitable vendor website, and supply eBooks to their retail partners [[Powell's Books|Powells.com]], Ebookmall.com, Diesel-ebooks.com, [[Fictionwise|Fictionwise.com]], Booksonboard.com and eBooksAboutEverything.com, but have no online retail outlet themselves to sell eBooks.

In March 2010 Ingram Digital (a wholesaler part of the same group) warned its customers it might not be able to sell them e-books, as most large publishers were moving from the wholesale model (publishers offer wholesale discounts, and the final price is determined by retailers) to the agency model (publishers set the retail price and offer agents a commission, so retailers earn more by buying direct from the publisher rather than via a wholesaler).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebigmoney.com/blogs/goodnight-gutenberg/2010/03/25/ebook-supply-chain-collapses|title=Business|website=Slate Magazine|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was triggered by the eBook pricing dispute between Amazon and [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], and the imminent launch of the [[iPad]].&lt;ref&gt;Mike Shatzkin, [http://www.idealog.com/blog/apples-disruption-of-the-ebook-market-has-nothing-to-do-with-the-tablet "Apple’s disruption of the ebook market has nothing to do with the tablet"], The Idea Logical Company (19 January 2010). Retrieved 25/03/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in April 2012 the U.S. Department of Justice sued Apple, Macmillan, and others on the basis that the agency model was anti-competitive and a form of collusion used to fix the price of e-books.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Braiker, [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/11/apple-accused-fixing-prices-ebooks "Apple accused by US of colluding with publishers to fix price of ebooks"],  ''[[The Guardian]]'', (11 April 2012). Retrieved 11/04/2012&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2012, Ingram Digital was still supplying e-books via its CoreSource programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ingramcontent.com/MRKNG/2011/52432/52432Coresource.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415024835/http://www.ingramcontent.com/MRKNG/2011/52432/52432Coresource.html |archivedate=2012-04-15 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7792">A '''methodological advisor''' or [[consultant]] provides methodological and statistical advice and guidance to clients interested in making decisions regarding the design of studies, the collection and analysis of data, and the presentation and dissemination of research findings.&lt;ref name="amh"&gt;[[Adèr, H.J.]], [[Gideon J. Mellenbergh|Mellenbergh, G.J.]], &amp; Hand, D.J. (2008). ''Advising on research methods: A consultant’s companion''. Johannes van Kessel Publishing: Huizen, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; Trained in both methods and statistics and communication skills, advisors may work in academia, industry, or the public sector.

==Education and employment==

Methodological advisors generally have post-graduate training in statistics, as well as relevant practical experience. In addition, advisors may also have significant education and experience in the particular field they work in. Some universities offer specific graduate programmes in fields such as [[biostatistics]], psychological methods, or methodology and statistics for the medical, behavioural, and social sciences.

Methodological consultants primarily find work in academia and industry. In the private sector, consultants may be part of an organisation, employed by a consultancy firm, or self-employed. Many universities offer [[List of university statistical consulting centers|in-house methodological advice for researchers]], as well as, in some cases, services for outside clients. The advisors may also be researchers of their own right and be deeply involved with particular projects. Project statisticians, in particular, are embedded with research groups and often developed a deep understanding not just of statistics, but also of the research topics themselves.&lt;ref name="amh" /&gt; In contrast, independent advisors are often only consulted on specific questions, and may be less involved with the project as a whole.

Disciplines in which methodological advice is sought stretch the entire width of the quantitative sciences, but may in particular include the [[medicine|medical sciences]], [[biology]], [[psychology|psychological research]], and [[business studies]]. Advisors are also consulted in public administration, where they may be involved at all levels of governance. In the legal system, consultants may be called upon as expert witnesses, in particular in cases that involve statistical considerations.&lt;ref name="amh" /&gt;

==Range of tasks==

The role of a methodological advisors varies from project to project, but can include any point in the research cycle. While ''cross-sectional consulting'' may only occur at one point during a project, ''longitudinal consulting'' may mean that the advisor stays with the project from beginning to end.&lt;ref name="gvb"&gt;Van Belle, G. (2008). ''Statistical rules of thumb (2nd ed.)''. New York, NY: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, advice is not limited to statistical questions.&lt;ref name="amh" /&gt; Broadly speaking, questions may concern the design of studies, choice or construction of measurement instruments, analysis of data, and presentation of results.&lt;ref name="amh" /&gt; In particular, common questions include:&lt;ref name="amh" /&gt;

* [[design of experiments]] and research studies
* plotting data
* measurement instruments (choosing, constructing &amp; analysing)
* determination of adequate [[sample size]] to detect a hypothesised effect
* determination of an adequate [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] procedure for a study, [[statistical survey|survey]] or [[experiment]]
* supervision of [[data]] collection to ensure elements of the [[population (statistics)|population]] are being sampled correctly
* statistical analyses (e.g., [[analysis of variance]], [[Regression analysis|regression]], etc.) of data to address research hypotheses
* the write-up of statistical results for grant proposals, manuscripts, professional conferences, or other presentations.

Giving methodological advice can mean answering specific questions or performing mundane data analyses, but may often go beyond that. In particular when clients have little understanding of research methods and statistics, consultants may have to clarify substantive questions and to translate them into methodological and statistical procedures. In private companies, the form of consultancy does not necessarily depend on the understanding of the client. Different companies may offer different forms of consulting, ranging from providing a quick fix for specific problems, provide extensive explanations to the client or even running the whole analyses.

In some cases, this may also entail profound ethical considerations.&lt;ref name="amh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gvb" /&gt; The client's occupation may form a constraint for the form in which consultancy can be offered.  For example, running data-analyses for companies may not be a problem, where doing this for a bachelors or masters student can be considered fraud.

==Skill set==

Although statisticians were traditionally trained largely on a technical skill set, recent times have brought a realisation that advisors need to be proficient in communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills just as well as in methodological questions.&lt;ref name="jd"&gt;Derr, J. (2008). Having an impact in a multi-disciplinary setting. In H. J. Adèr &amp; G. J. Mellenbergh (Eds.), ''Proceedings of the 2007 KNAW colloquium Advising on research methods'' (pp. 11-20).&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they have to be able to elicit explanations from clients and to give clear explanations of methods and statistics themselves. Because in some cases the implications of methodological advice may be profound (e.g., it may not be possible to conduct certain experiments, or to gain certain insights from data already collected), consultants also have to be able to communicate such ramifications.&lt;ref name="amh" /&gt;

'''Michael Fingleton''' is a former chief executive of [[Irish Nationwide Building Society]]. He joined the building society in 1971 and retired in April 2009 as the effects of the [[2008–2012 Irish banking crisis]] became apparent.  He is known as "Fingers" in the banking community.&lt;ref name ="Fingers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2009/0501/1224245756853.html|author=Simon Carswell|title=What lies in store for Irish Nationwide after Fingleton?|publisher=''[[Irish Times]]''|date=01/05/2010|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Michael Fingleton was born in [[Tubbercurry]], [[Co. Sligo]] in 1938, the son of a local [[Garda Síochána|Garda]]. He attended St Nathy's school in [[Ballaghaderreen]], and in later years [[University College Dublin|UCD]], [[Trinity College, Dublin|TCD]] and [[Kings Inns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/michael-fingleton-the-cv-477533.html|title=MICHAEL FINGLETON THE CV|publisher= ''[[Irish Independent]]''|date=22 February 2004|accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended a [[seminary]], but quit before taking his vows.&lt;ref name="Pointing Fingers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2009/02/22/story39728.asp |title=Pointing Fingers |author=Nicola Cooke |publisher=''[[Sunday Business Post]]'' |date=22 February 2009 |accessdate=30 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410043553/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2009/02/22/story39728.asp |archivedate=10 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early Sixties, he joined [[Allied Irish Finance]] and simultaneously began studying commerce. On earning his [[Academic degree|degree]], he went to the [[Dairy Disposal Agency]], a state body that took over defunct creameries in the west of Ireland. During this period, he studied at night to become a [[chartered accountant]].&lt;ref name="Pointing Fingers"/&gt;

Following this, he joined aid agency [[Concern Worldwide|Concern]] and from 1969 he spent a number of years organising food supplies to the [[Republic of Biafra]], the short-lived secessionist state in southeastern [[Nigeria]]. He eventually became chairman of Concern.&lt;ref name="Pointing Fingers" /&gt;

==Career at Irish Nationwide==
In 1971, he became the secretary of the Irish Independent Building Society, founded in 1873. At the time he was not a homeowner. The building society had five employees and assets of €2 million.  In his first year at the helm, the company made a profit of just €12,000 and Fingleton had to wait three years for his first company car.&lt;ref name ="one man" /&gt;

In 1973 he was [[called to the bar]], the same year that [[Dick Spring]], [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]] and [[Adrian Hardiman]] were also called, although he never practised as a barrister.&lt;ref name= "profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/profile--behind-the-kindly-smile-there-lurks-a-very-shrewd-operator-93213.html|title=PROFILE : Behind the kindly smile there lurks a very shrewd operator|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''|date=17 June 2006|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building society changed its name to Irish Nationwide in 1975&lt;ref name ="Finfacts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1019486.shtml|title=State bailed-out commercial property lender Irish Nationwide reports massive 2009 loss of €2.5bn|publisher=Finfacts Ireland|date=19 April 2010|accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began to expand. The key to its expansion was marketing, using the media to build the profile of the business. The emphasis was on the use of [[Agency (law)|agents]] rather than opening branches. Fingleton built it up into a network of 50 branches and 40 branch agents, helped by the takeover of the [[Garda Building Society]], Irish Mutual and Metropolitan Building Society and enacted a flexible [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] policy in the 1980s.  Fingleton cultivated relationships with the press and benefitted by receiving free [[public relations|publicity]]. Many journalists in the 1980s received mortgages from the Irish Nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1016362.shtml|title=Fingleton to resign from Irish Nationwide Building Society|publisher=Finfacts Ireland|date=02/04/2009|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fingleton always stressed that these were all above board. During the 1980s, when he was at the height of his media profile, he sent journalists a Christmas card portraying himself as [[Santa Claus]].&lt;ref name="The Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/05/01/story4378.asp |title=One-man building society |author=Ian Kehoe |publisher=''[[Sunday Business Post]]'' |date=01/05/2005 |accessdate=5 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050521010645/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/05/01/story4378.asp |archivedate=21 May 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fingleton drew a salary of €1.3m in 2005, including a €500,000 bonus making his earnings on a par with chief executives of the larger banks.&lt;ref name= "profile" /&gt; He began to look for [[demutualisation]] legislation in 2001 with the change in the law coming through in August 2006. In 2007, after failed talks with Germany's [[HypoVereinsbank]] and [[GE Money]], he almost sold the building society to Iceland's [[Landsbanki]]. Fingleton set Irish Nationwide's asset value close to €1.3 billion to reflect the equity he expected to be released from any deals. Fingleton expected to earn up to €15 million from the deal.&lt;ref name ="one man"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/a-oneman-band-1366187.html|title=a one-man band?|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''|date=03/05/2008|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landsbanki who were initially attracted by Irish Nationwide's deposit book, backed off, unnerved by the level of the society's commercial lending. The Icelandic bank collapsed nine months later.&lt;ref name="Sunday Times" /&gt;

Fingleton had a reputation as an [[Autocracy|autocrat]]&lt;ref name= "profile" /&gt; and effectively ran a one-man lending department with loans of over €500,000 being personally approved by him.&lt;ref name= "The Post" /&gt; In 2002 it emerged that he had an affair with a subordinate who was provided with a £200,000 settlement after she took her case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.&lt;ref name = "Sticky Fingers" /&gt; When Irish Nationwides home loans manager Brian Fitzgibbon sued to stop the building society from sacking him in 2007, it reinforced the impression that Fingleton totally dominated the institution. In his evidence, Fitzgibbon alleged that Fingleton over-ruled his decision not to lend money to rogue solicitors Micheal Lynn and Thomas Byrne to whom the building society loaned over €10m each. Fitzgibbon went on to allege that the Nationwide's lending decisions ''"were entirely informal and controlled by Michael Fingleton"''. Fitzgibbon also stated that many loans issued by the Irish Nationwide had not been approved by its credit committee, which existed only to satisfy the requirements of the [[Central Bank of Ireland]]. Fingleton said the society took "adequate provisions" in 2007 for loans to the rogue solicitors as it booked a total loan loss charge of €48.8m.&lt;ref name="Pointing Fingers" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="one man" /&gt;

By the end of 2007, Irish Nationwide had become a major financial institution with pre-tax profits of €390m for 2006 and gross assets of €16.1bn. He had managed to bring the group's cost-to-income ratio down to 10pc from 14.4pc the previous year.&lt;ref name ="one man" /&gt; The same year, Fingleton transferred a €27.6m pension fund from the society.&lt;ref name="Sunday Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article7094131.ece|title=Avoiding the fall out at Irish Nationwide|author=Aine Coffey|publisher=''[[The Sunday Times]]''|date=11/04/2010|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loans to politicians and other public figures===
As well as arranging loans for journalists, Fingleton arranged loans for other political and public figures.  In December 2009, after interviewing Olivia Greene, a former home loans supervisor at Irish Nationwide, Prime Time reported that former Minister for Finance [[Charlie McCreevy]] was loaned €1.6m for a €1.5m property by Irish Nationwide, when the building society wasn't supposed to be providing 100 per cent loans.  He also provided a loan for [[Celia Larkin]], the ex-partner of former [[taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]], without requiring any proof of income.  John Mara, the son of former [[Fianna Fáil]] director of elections [[PJ Mara]], was also named in court as having drawn down big loans, including a €1.5 million loan for which Fingleton did not seek any additional security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepost.ie/story/eyidqlgbql/ |title=The untouchable and the untenable |author=Kathleen Barrington |publisher=''[[Sunday Business Post]]'' |date=25 April 2010 |accessdate=5 May 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greene also said current Fianna Fáil Senator [[Francis O'Brien]] and former FF Senator [[Don Lydon]] were given fast-track loans of €7m and €3m&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/home/society-launches-loans-to-politicians-inquiry-108460.html#ixzz0n5qxbTUa|title=Society launches loans to politicians inquiry|author=Conor Ryan|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''|date=23 December 2009|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of the economic crisis and retirement===
The performance of the building society [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|crashed in 2008]] as bad loans spiralled. Irish Nationwide made a pretax loss of €280 million for the year, after writing off €464 million on bad loans, a 10-fold increase on the 2007 figure.&lt;ref name ="Fingers" /&gt; The state was eventually forced to inject €2.7 billion into the society to shore up its balance sheet and prevent the collapse of a [[Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008|government-guaranteed]] institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbpost.ie/newsfeatures/the-fall-of-the-house-of-fingleton-48820.html|title=The fall of the house of Fingleton|author=David Clerkin|publisher=''[[Sunday Business Post]]''|date=25 April 2010|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the 2008 annual board meeting, with Fingleton approaching 70, when he would be required to retire as a director, the board considered tabling a motion that would permit him to stay on for another two years. The idea was abandoned and Fingleton refused to stay on as the chief executive unless he was paid the same amount as in 2007, when he had received a €1m bonus. At the end of April 2009, Fingleton retired, buffeted by criticism for receiving the €1m "bonus" in 2008.&lt;ref name="Sunday Times" /&gt; He left Irish Nationwide relying on the continued support of the Irish government through the guarantee scheme to raise funding from bond investors to keep the institution in business. Losses from 2009 of €2.5bn&lt;ref name ="Finfacts" /&gt; effectively wiped out all profits made by the society since its inception as Irish Nationwide.&lt;ref name="Sticky Fingers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.ie/news/article/2010/apr/25/sticky-fingers/ |title=Sticky Fingers |author=Michael Clifford |publisher=''The Tribune'' |date=25 April 2010 |accessdate=02/05/2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430072018/http://www.tribune.ie/news/article/2010/apr/25/sticky-fingers/ |archivedate=30 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fingleton received €221k in pay for the final four months of his employment, up to April 2009. This amount, calculated on an annual basis, exceeded the cap of €500k imposed by the Government for top bankers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emigrant.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=77600|title=Banks and bankers under scrutiny|publisher=''The Irish Emigrant''|date=26/04/10|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the depth of the society's problems became apparent, Fingleton came under public and political pressure to return the €1m bonus. In April 2010 he offered to give it to charity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbpost.ie/breakingnews/ireland/eyojojcwgboj/|title=Fingleton wants to give €1m bonus to charity|publisher=''[[Sunday Business Post]]''|date=25 April 2009|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this proposal was rejected by the Irish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/fingletons-euro1m-to-charity-proposal-rejected-118135.html/|title=Fingleton's €1m to charity proposal rejected|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''|date=26 April 2009|accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010 there was no evidence that the money had been returned.

==Personal and family==
Michael Fingleton is married to his wife, Eileen.  They live in Shankill in South Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/mar/29/fingleton-registered-irish-nationwide-loan-at-age-/ |title=Fingleton registered Irish Nationwide loan at age 68 |publisher=''[[Sunday Tribune]]'' |author=Neil Callanan and Emmet Oliver |date=29 March 2010 |accessdate=30 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403014323/http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/mar/29/fingleton-registered-irish-nationwide-loan-at-age-/ |archivedate=3 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoys [[horse racing]] and frequently attends racing festivals.

'''Milan Platovsky Stein''' (1922 – 2012) was a [[Czech Republic|Czech]]-[[Chile]]an businessman and a [[Holocaust]] survivor.

He was born into a [[Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Prague]]. His father was a businessman while his mother was a woman of senior Czech bourgeoisie. He lived a carefree childhood.&lt;ref name="reportajes1"&gt;[[El Mercurio|El Mercurio (Santiago)]], 26 October 1997, p.D17&lt;/ref&gt; At age 17, in the middle of systematic harassment suffered as a result of Nazi policies, he was subjected to forced labour and various humiliations. Already underway [[World War II]], he was taken to various units of extermination, such as [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]].&lt;ref name="mercurio1"&gt;[[El Mercurio|El Mercurio (Santiago)]], 30 December 2012, p.C13&lt;/ref&gt; This experience, like others of his life, would make public in texts, most notably ''Sobrevivir: Memorias de un resiliente'', 1997.

He arrived in Chile from [[France]] in 1950, escaping from [[communism]], which was gaining ground in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="quepasa1"&gt;[[Qué Pasa (magazine)|Qué Pasa (Santiago)]], 26 September 2003, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notional Profit'''

A contract usually takes several years to get itself completed. If the profit on such contracts is recorded only after their completion, then wide fluctuations may be noted in the profit figures of contractors from year to year. To avoid these fluctuations in the reported profits and to reflect the revenue in the accounting period during which the activity is undertaken, the profit in respect of each contract in progress is transferred to the profit and loss account of the year by calculating the notional profit. The portion of notional profit to be transferred to the profit and loss account depends on the stage of completion of a contract.

[[Image:Port of Decatur.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The main river entrance to the port.]]

The '''Port of Decatur''' is a [[transshipment]] [[port]] on the [[Tennessee River]], in the city of [[Decatur, Alabama]], [[United States of America]]. The port was founded in 1971.&lt;ref name="Dectransit"&gt;{{cite web | title =Port of Decatur: Facts and Figures | publisher =Decatur Transit | month = | year =2007 | url =http://www.decaturtransit.com/269/Facts_and_Figures.aspx | accessdate =2008-07-11 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://archive.is/20130121121703/http://www.decaturtransit.com/269/Facts_and_Figures.aspx | archivedate =2013-01-21 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Port facilities ==
Port facilities include [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] transfer points for switches between barge, road and rail, storage facilities for bulk liquids, dry bulk and general cargo and {{convert|12|acre|m2}} of open storage. Serviceable quay length is {{convert|2000|ft|m}}, with a year-round draft of nine metres.&lt;ref name="Dectransit"/&gt;

The port is directly connected to the [[Norfolk Southern]] and [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] railroads and to interstate and regional highway networks.

== Industries ==
Port throughput is dominated by imports of industrial and agricultural commodities including sand, asphalt, grains and fertilizers, coal, and steel piping.&lt;ref name="Dectransit"/&gt; From 2005 the port also began handling poultry feed products for nationwide poultry firm [[Golden Kist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Wilson |first =Jay |coauthors = |title =Bunge expansion to breathe life into Decatur port| work =The Decatur Daily News | pages = | publisher =The Decatur Daily | date =2005-05-27 | url =http://legacy.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/050527/bunge.shtml | accessdate =2008-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Exports are limited by the cost-efficiency of road and rail distribution networks, forcing many barges accessing the port to return empty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Fleischauer |first =Eric |coauthors = |title =River, rails, roads and air: Transport hub drives Decatur’s economy | work =The Decatur Daily News | pages = | publisher =The Decatur Daily | date =2006-10-01 | url =http://legacy.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/061001/hub.shtml | accessdate =2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shipping times to [[New Orleans]] are approximately two weeks from loading.&lt;ref name="Dectransit"/&gt;

'''Raja Pervaiz Ashraf''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|راجہ پرویز اشرف}}}}; born 26 December 1950), is a [[businessman]], [[agriculturist]], and [[politician]] who served as 19th [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] from 22 June 2012 until completing his designated term on 16 March 2013.&lt;ref name="Raja Pervez Ashraf elected PM"&gt;{{cite news|title=Raja Pervez Ashraf declared new Pakistani PM|url=http://dawn.com/2012/06/22/parliament-begins-new-pm-election/|accessdate=22 June 2012|newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|DAWN]] |date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pmo.gov.pk/former_pms.php|title=FORMER PRIME MINISTERS |publisher=pmo.gov.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently resides in Sanghar House,[[ Gujar Khan Tehsil|Gujar Khan]].

Prior to be elevated as Prime minister, he previously served as the [[Minister for Water and Power (Pakistan)|Minister for Water and Power]] in the [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]]-led government from March 2008 to February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008\04\01\story_1-4-2008_pg1_5 |title=24-member federal cabinet takes oath|newspaper=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]| first=Sajjad|last=Malik|accessdate=1 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A senior-ranking leader in the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) from [[Rawalpindi District]], Ashraf assumed premiership on 22 June 2012 after Yousaf Raza Gillani was disqualified over [[contempt of court]] charges. Shortlisted by the PPP as a candidate for the post, he was eventually elected based on a 211–89 vote in the National Assembly. Tackling the corruption scandals, one of the major achievements during his premiership was his interest to develop and implement hydro projects in particular Neelum-Jhelum project of 970 MW.

The project had received a big jolt when the Chinese Exim Bank refused to release $448 million loan linking it to the restoration of the Safe City Project in Islamabad which has been stopped by the Supreme Court of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-20043-Rs24-bn-diverted-to-Neelum-Jhelum-project |title=Rs24 bn diverted to Neelum-Jhelum project|work=[[The News International]]|date=6 January 2013|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure [[Water and Power Development Authority]] (WAPDA) had launched a number of mega and medium-sized projects in [[Gilgit–Baltistan]].&lt;ref name="pakobserver.net"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pakobserver.net/detailnews.asp?id=198920 |title=PPP govt pursuing multi-pronged strategy for GB development|work=[[Pakistan Observer]]|date=6 March 2013|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PPP-Hoarding.JPG|thumbnail|Raja Ashraf on a hoarding]]

===Member of Parliament===
Ashraf has been twice elected Member of the [[National Assembly of Pakistan]] (MNA) from his constituency of [[Gujar Khan]], Rawalpindi District.&lt;ref name=profile /&gt; He won re-election in the [[Pakistani general election, 2008|February 2008 elections]]. During his time as an MNA, he served as a member of the Standing Committee on Kashmir and the Standing Committee on Law, Justice and Human Rights.&lt;ref name="toiprofile"/&gt; Before his ascendance to the post of prime minister, he was also the secretary general of the PPP.&lt;ref name="infopak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infopak.gov.pk/primeminister.aspx|title=Raja Pervez Ashraf|work=[[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (Pakistan)]]|accessdate=5 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616033558/http://www.infopak.gov.pk/primeminister.aspx|archivedate=16 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water and Power ministry===
He became the head of the [[Ministry of Water and Power (Pakistan)|Water and Power Ministry]] in the coalition government of [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]], [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|PML-N]], [[Awami National Party|ANP]], [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam|JUI-F]] and [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement|MQM]] formed after the 2008 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/2008/03/29/top1.htm|title=Parties finally clinch deal on key ministries|first=Amir|last=Wasim|newspaper=DAWN|accessdate=29 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure as power minister, there was a chronic shortage of electricity generation throughout the country and power cuts ([[load shedding]]) remained frequent. In the position, he faced heavy criticism for repeatedly promising the country's power crisis would be over "by 2008" as the country suffered regular blackouts.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; He became one of the most sought after ministers in the National Assembly, by legislators who demanded answers for the power crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/398379/as-water-and-power-czar-ashraf-was-the-most-sought-after-minister-in-na/|title= As water and power czar, Ashraf was the most sought after minister in NA|work=The Express Tribune|date=24 June 2012|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a report on his parliamentary performance, the water and power ministry while Ashraf was in-charge received as many as 1,147 official questions and queries, of which only 60% were responded to.

The report opined that Ashraf's performance as minister was "tainted by failures to overcome the power shortfall that continued to aggravate even after he was replaced" and that his actions and responses both inside and outside the National Assembly had "not been translated into actions" &lt;ref name= "dailytimes"/&gt; Nevertheless, about 3,570 megawatts of power was added to the national grid during the PPP government, a major portion of which came during Ashraf's term in office. His term is said to have overseen relatively more megawatts being added to the national grid when compared to other ministers of power and energy since [[Benazir Bhutto]]'s last government.&lt;ref name="dailytimes"/&gt; He was accused of receiving kickbacks in the rental power projects, and of using illegal money to buy foreign property.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; Ashraf denied the charges, and as of June 2012, was defending himself before the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; No official charges have been framed against him as no evidence could be presented so far.

One of the main reasons for power crisis, which have never received due attention and focus is the circular debt and which continued to increase over the years. The government has time and again tried to clear the circular debt, however it comes again. This is because of the structural issues including power theft,  poor recovery from other government departments, difference between cost of generation and actual cost charged to customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=: [https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2012/05/pakistan’s-energy-crisis] |title=Pakistan’s energy crisis Power politics|work=[[The Economist]]|date=21 May 2012|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During Ashraf`s government prioritised hydro power projects in particular Neelum Jhelum 970 MW. During his term, WAPDA initiated several hydro projects in Gilgit Baltistan (GB) including the Satpara Dam having 17 MW power generation capacity and 0.093 million acre feetwater storage capacity and Diamer-Bhasha Dam having 4,500 MW power generation capacity and 8.1 million acre feet water storage capacity, along with hydropower projects of 7,100 MW Bunji, 34 MW Harpo, 80 MW Phandar and 40 MW Basho.&lt;ref name="pakobserver.net"/&gt;

Hydro power is the cheapest energy source and as Minister and PM he gave special attention, however hydro power projects take long time to complete and the electricity from the projects will be available after 10 years. In order to resolve short term energy crisis, Ashraf implemented power project on rental basis, following the rental policy approved in Mushrrafs tenure. However the projects became controversial.

==Prime Minister of Pakistan==

===Early days===
On 26 April 2012, Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] was convicted of being in contempt of court for refusing to bring charges against President [[Asif Ali Zardari]]. On 19 June 2012, Gillani was retroactively ruled ineligible to hold the office by the Supreme Court. The ruling [[Pakistan People's Party]] nominated textile minister [[Makhdoom Shahabuddin]] to replace Gillani, but the nomination failed when the [[Anti-Narcotics Force]] issued a warrant for Shahabuddin's arrest on drug charges.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; Ashraf was then selected as the party's next option.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

On 22 June 2012, Raja Pervez Ashraf was elected [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] of [[Pakistan]] by a 211–89 vote.&lt;ref name="Raja Pervez Ashraf elected PM"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Raja-Pervez-Ashraf-elected-new-PM-of-Pakistan/articleshow/14342856.cms| title=Raja Pervez Ashraf elected new PM of Pakistan| newspaper=[[The Times of India]]| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622181805/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Raja-Pervez-Ashraf-elected-new-PM-of-Pakistan/articleshow/14342856.cms| archivedate=22 June 2012| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashraf and his cabinet were sworn in on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-55575-Raja-Parvaiz-Ashraf-and-federal-cabinet-to-take-oath-tonight|newspaper=[[The News International]]|title=Raja Pervaiz to be sworn in tonight| date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His selection as Prime Minister restored the country's government after several days of turmoil where officially the country was without a government.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|title=Raja Pervaiz Ashraf Is Pakistan's New Prime Minister|author=Rebecca Santana|author2=Chris Brummitt|author3=Zarar Khan|date=22 June 2012|agency=Associated Press|work=Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/22/raja-pervaiz-ashraf-pakistan-prime-minister_n_1618675.html|accessdate=23 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803061417/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/22/raja-pervaiz-ashraf-pakistan-prime-minister_n_1618675.html|archivedate=3 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] said Ashraf's election was "unlikely to calm the tensions roiling the country" and noted that many observers expected him be eventually be ousted like his predecessor.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; Political analyst Raza Rumi said Ashraf was likely chosen by the PPP because they knew he would not last long.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; On 24 July 2012, the Government informed the Supreme Court, one day before expiry of the court's deadline, that it has not taken a decision on reopening of the graft cases against President Zardari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.indianexpress.com/news/after-gilani-ashraf-defies-pak-sc-order-to-reopen-case-against-zardari/978742/0|title= After Gilani, Ashraf defies Pak SC order to reopen case against Zardari|date= 24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socioeconomic challenges===

Immediately after his election, Ashraf said that the economy, inflation, and the country's power crisis would be his top concerns. "Our country cannot afford politics of confrontation at this time," he said.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;  Within 24 hours of being elected, Ashraf held a meeting to resolve the energy crisis in the country and directed the Ministry of Petroleum to ensure the supply of 28,000 tonnes of fuel daily to power plants, so as to add 1200 mega watts to the national grid system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/398102/first-task-prime-minister-ashraf-calls-conference-on-energy-crisis/|title=Ensure 28000 tonnes per day fuel to power plants: Ashraf|work=The Express Tribune|date=23 June 2012|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were power protests erupting throughout the country for continual load shedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-7-118582-Power-protesters-block-roads-as-PM-visits-Peshawar|title=Power protesters block roads as PM visits Peshawar|work=The News|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pakistan Economy Watch]]  (PEW) was critical of this renewed focus on energy, calling it a "useless effort" with the president of PEW, Murtaza Mughal, remarking that load shedding had only "increased in the harrowing summer", making life difficult for the ordinary citizen; Mughal further noted that the announcement of adding more fuel into independent power producers had been portrayed positively, despite the fact that the actual problem did not lie in scarcity of fuel but rather in non-payment of dues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/403718/energy-woes-pms-efforts-unproductive-says-pew/|title=Energy woes: PM’s efforts unproductive, says PEW|work=The Express Tribune|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businesspeople and economists in Pakistan had a mixed response to Ashraf's appointment; while some appreciated the prime minister's focus on the energy crisis and hoped for greater cooperation between key institutions and political parties as being good for economic stability, others questioned his reputation related to rental power and expressed anxiety over the government's ongoing clash with the judiciary which could cause uncertainty and scare businesses away. A government official praised the smooth transition of power and said that the country's economic policy would stay the same, adding that the government's economic team will carry on with implementing the [[2012 Pakistan federal budget|budget]] and other economic functions as present before Gillani's disqualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=516508&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=41&amp;parent_id=23|title=Business community expects no wonders from PM Raja|work=[[Gulf Times]]|date=3 July 2012|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an initiative to overcome the energy crises, Ashraf announced his intention to build several small dams across the country. He said that these projects would start from his native Potohar plateau, as part of a development programme for the Potohar region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/405258/pm-ashraf-wants-small-dams-to-meet-power-needs/|title=PM Ashraf wants small dams to meet power needs|work=The Express Tribune|date=8 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from energy, he identified the deteriorating law and order situation of Karachi, especially with regards to [[Target killings in Karachi|target killings]], as a second major challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/06/26/news/national/energy-karachi-security-major-challenges-pm/|title=Energy, Karachi security major challenges: PM|work=[[Pakistan Today]]|date=26 June 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, during his maiden trip to [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], Ashraf announced a [[Pakistani rupee|Rs.]] 2 billion development package for the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/444249/pm-announces-rs2b-package-for-g-b/|title=PM announces Rs2b package for G-B|date=29 September 2012|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July 2012, The Supreme Court in its NRO implementation case order has ruled that Prime Minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf must write the letter to Swiss authorities to reopen graft cases against President Asif Ali Zardari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-58528-SC-orders-PM-Ashraf-to-write-letter-|title=SC orders PM Ashraf to write letter|work=The News International|date=12 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July 2012, The Supreme Court gave Raja Pervaiz Ashraf to 8 August 2012 to implement its order by writing a letter to Swiss authorities to reopen graft cases against President Asif Ali Zradari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-60410-NRO-Implementation:-SC-orders-PM-Ashraf-to-write-letter-by-August-8|title=NRO: PM ordered to write letter by Aug 8|work=The News International|date=25 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 August 2012, the supreme court adjourned the hearing till 18 September 2012

===Political developments===
Three days after his election, Ashraf visited [[Nine Zero]] and met with leaders of the [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement]] in Karachi. He also visited the leader of the [[Pakistan Muslim League (F)]]. The visits were seen as part of a fresh move to reaffirm ties with coalition political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dawn.com/2012/06/25/pm-ashraf-visits-nine-zero-kingri-house-during-karachi-visit/|title=PM Ashraf visits Nine Zero, Kingri House during Karachi visit|work=Dawn|date=25 June 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first significant milestone Ashraf performed after taking charge of his office was an approval for the creation of a post of [[Deputy Prime Minister of Pakistan]] to fulfill a demand of the coalition party [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)]] (PML-Q). The post was inaugurated on 25 June and [[Chaudhry Pervez Elahi]] of PML-Q was appointed as the first deputy prime minister of the country.&lt;ref name="demands_fulfilled"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dawn.com/2012/06/25/demands-fulfilled-15-ministries-granted-to-pml-q/|title=PML-Q’s demands fulfilled; Elahi made Deputy PM, 15 ministries granted|work=Dawn|date=25 June 2012|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the position is largely symbolic and has no legal constitutional duties.

On 27 June 2012, the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] gave prime minister Ashraf two weeks to indicate whether he would ask Swiss authorities to reopen [[corruption]] cases against president Zardari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pakobserver.net/detailnews.asp?id=162193|title=SC wants Swiss letter by PM in two weeks|work=[[Pak Observer]]|date=28 June 2012|accessdate=15 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ayl4EWFi?url=http://pakobserver.net/detailnews.asp?id=162193|archivedate=27 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ashraf stated that his position on the issue was no different from that of previous prime minister Gillani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012%5C06%5C27%5Cstory_27-6-2012_pg7_2|title=Petition filed against new PM over Swiss letter|work=Daily Times|date=27 June 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first week of July, he directed attention on the [[Balochistan conflict]] and called for a high-level meeting to discuss the issue of [[Missing persons (Pakistan)|missing persons]] in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dunyanews.tv/index.php?key=Q2F0SUQ9MiNOaWQ9ODgwNDU=|title=High-level meeting on missing persons’ issue today|work=Dunya News|date=3 July 2012|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first week of July, Ashraf announced the government's plans to establish legislation which would remove the bar on dual nationality holders from contesting in elections. If passed, the legislation would enable [[Overseas Pakistanis]] holding dual nationalities eligible to participate in elections and hold public office. The enforcement of such a legislation remains a controversial issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012%5C07%5C02%5Cstory_2-7-2012_pg1_3|title=Govt will bring law to allow dual nationals contest elections: PM|work=Daily Times|date=2 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a visit to [[Peshawar]] a few days later, where he met local politicians, during which he expressed his views on the parliament being "the mother of all institutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/national/05-Jul-2012/parliament-is-the-mother-of-all-institutions-pm|title=Parliament is the mother of all institutions: PM|work=The Nation|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has praised the role of [[Democracy in Pakistan|democracy]] in creating an "independent media, judiciary and parliament." He further paid tribute to the [[Pakistan Army]] in its [[Pakistan's role in the War on Terror|role in the War on Terror]] and military operations in the troubled northwestern areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012%5C07%5C11%5Cstory_11-7-2012_pg7_16|title=Independent media, judiciary, parliament fruits of democracy: PM|date=11 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fraud case against [[Asif Ali Zardari]], he indicated in September 2012 that he would be willing to open the pending fraud cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2012/09/20129181154102792.html|title=Pakistan to 'reopen Zardari fraud cases' – Central &amp; South Asia|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=18 September 2012|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
When commenting on [[Foreign relations of Pakistan|foreign policy]] after assuming premiership, Ashraf said that he wanted to deal with the [[United States]] on "an equal footing".&lt;ref name=AP /&gt; However, he will likely have to deal with the court's demands to charge Zardari before doing much else.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt; [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]] of [[India]] congratulated Ashraf shortly after his election, and anticipated greater progress in bilateral [[India–Pakistan relations|relations between the two countries]] during Ashraf's term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pmindia.nic.in/press-details.php?nodeid=1453|title=PM congratulates Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf|work=[[Prime Minister's Office (India)]]|date=22 June 2012|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government greeted Ashraf and pledged [[China–Pakistan relations|closer ties with Pakistan]] to strengthen their "all-weather friendship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-06-25/news/32409313_1_yousuf-raza-gilani-ministry-spokesman-hong-lei-friendly-neighbour|title=China greets new Pakistan PM Raja Pervez Ashraf; pledges close partnership|work=The Economic Times|date=25 June 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable messages of congratulation came from U.S.&amp;nbsp;Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] and Afghan president [[Hamid Karzai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-56909-Clinton-hopes-relations-will-improve-during-PM-Raja-Pervaiz's-tenure|title=Hillary Clinton calls PM Raja Pervaiz|work=Dawn|date=1 June 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://president.gov.af/en/news/10794|title=President Karzai Congratulates Pakistan’s New Prime Minister|work=Office of the President of Afghanistan|date=23 June 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June 2012, several [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|Tehrik-i-Taliban]] militants from Afghanistan entered Pakistan's [[Durand Line|bordering]] [[FATA|tribal areas]] killing 13 Pakistani troops, of which seven were beheaded. During the conflict, Pakistani troops killed fourteen of the raiding militants. The attack, one of several such [[Afghanistan–Pakistan skirmishes|cross-border skirmishes]], was strongly condemned with Raja Pervaiz Ashraf stating that the matter would be directly taken to Afghan president Hamid Karzai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/26/militants-behead-pakistani-troops-afghanistan|title=Militants 'behead Pakistani troops after crossing border from Afghanistan'|work=The Guardian|date=26 June 2012|accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/world/asia/taliban-kill-13-soldiers-in-pakistan-raid.html|title=Taliban Kill 13 Soldiers in Pakistan Raid|work=The New York Times|date=25 June 2012|accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/410064/cross-border-attacks-high-on-agenda-for-ashrafs-afghanistan-tour/|title=Cross-border attacks high on agenda for Ashraf's Afghanistan tour|work=The Express Tribune|date=18 July 2012|accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his stand on the [[Kashmir conflict]] with India, Ashraf has categorically stated that Pakistan would continue providing moral, political, and diplomatic support to the [[Kashmiri people]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] until a solution was to be reached for the issue in accordance with UN&amp;nbsp;resolutions and Kashmiri aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-06/pakistan/32565564_1_kashmir-issue-indian-counterpart-ranjan-mathai-india-and-pakistan|title=Pakistan to continue support to Kashmir cause: PM Raja Pervez Ashraf|work=The Times of India|date=6 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/410381/pm-ashraf-calls-for-resolving-tensions-with-india/|title=PM Ashraf calls for resolving tensions with India|work=The Express Tribune|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=19 July 2012|first=A. H.|last=Nizami}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashraf is expected to visit [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]], to hold talks with the Afghan leadership on the peace process in Afghanistan amidst the ongoing Afghan war and to discuss the status of Afghan-led reconciliation with the [[Afghan Taliban]]. The visit comes at a time when Pakistan's relations with the United States have improved in the aftermath of the 2011 NATO attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/406063/pm-ashraf-to-visit-kabul-to-expedite-peace-efforts/|title=PM Ashraf to visit Kabul to expedite peace efforts|work=The Express Tribune|date=10 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 July, he performed a two-day state visit to [[Saudi Arabia]], his first official tour since becoming prime minister. During the visit, he would perform [[Umrah]], meet with King [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]], discuss the status of [[Pakistan-Saudi Arabia relations|relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia]] and also meet members of the [[Pakistanis in Saudi Arabia|Pakistani community in Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.tv/GeoDetail.aspx?ID=58966|title=GeoTV Geo News Latest News Breaking News Pakistan Live Videos|work=geo.tv|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his visit to [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]], in late July 2012, Ashraf met with Karzai government officials and engaged in talks with the two main opposition leaders [[Abdullah Abdullah]] from the [[National Coalition of Afghanistan]] and [[Ahmad Zia Massoud]] from the [[National Front of Afghanistan]]. Among other things they discussed the need for increased and regular dialogue between leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etelaf-melli.com/contents.php?lang=fa&amp;section=interviews&amp;id=591 Ashraf in Kabul] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130122154401/http://www.etelaf-melli.com/contents.php?lang=fa&amp;section=interviews&amp;id=591 |date=22 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March, the apex court had directed the National Accountability Bureau to proceed against those who were in the post of minister for water and power from 2006 till the next general elections. As a result, on 20 April, NAB issued arrest warrants for 33 persons, including Ashraf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2013/01/15/supreme-court-orders-to-arrest-prime-minister-raja-pervez-ashraf/ |title=Rental power case: Supreme Court orders to arrest Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf |publisher=The News Tribe |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Arrest order===
On 15 January 2013, the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] ordered the arrest of Raja Pervaiz Ashraf for alleged [[Political corruption|corruption]] as Ashraf was accused of [[kickbacks]] from rental [[Power station|power plants]] that were part of a project intended to serve as part of the solution to Pakistan's power problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Alex|title=Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf ordered arrested|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/15/world/la-fg-pakistan-corruption-20130116|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media derided Raja Pervaiz Ashraf as ''Rental Raja''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awaztoday.com/News-Talk-Shows/24470/Raja-Pervaiz-Ashraf-Raja-Rental-History.aspx Raja Pervaiz Ashraf ‘Raja Rental’ History]&lt;/ref&gt; The arrest order came at the same time as the [[Long March (Pakistan)|Long March]] culminated in the national capital of [[Islamabad]]. None of the accused in the rental case has been convicted so far. The rental power case is pending with independent Supreme court for nearly four years and no conviction has been made. Ashraf has time and again demanded clearance of his name and denies all the charges. Ashraf in his appearance in the Supreme Court categorically denied such charges and offered his complete cooperation  with all authorities and courts.  A member of the ruling [[Pakistan People's Party]] referred to the arrest order as "a conspiracy" while Pakistan's interior minister [[Rehman Malik]], claimed that "Even after this order, (Ashraf) is the prime minister and, God willing, he will continue as prime minister."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Habib|first=Nasir|title=Pakistani Supreme Court orders arrest of prime minister in corruption case|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/15/world/asia/pakistan-politics/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=17 January 2013|author2=Jethro Mullen }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Accountability Bureau|accountability court]] in Islamabad [[Indictment|indicted]] former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] Raja Pervez Ashraf and six others in the rental power case on 16 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/islamabad/17-Jan-2014/raja-pervez-ashraf-indicted-in-rental-power-case|title=Raja Pervez Ashraf indicted in rental power case|date=17 January 2014|work=The Nation|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Nepotism===
Raja Pervez Ashraf appointed his son-in-law Raja Azeem in World Bank (Executive Director-Pakistan and others) in violation of rules and an example of Nepotism prevalent in Pakistani political elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/480045/pm-appoints-son-in-law-to-key-world-bank-post/|title=PM appoints son-in-law to key World Bank post|date=15 December 2012|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School Enterprise Challenge''' is an international competition for schools to establish profitable student-led businesses. 

It aims to develop young people’s business and soft skills to better prepare them for the world of work and to develop their capacities as socially responsible entrepreneurs. The income generated from these businesses moreover can provide a useful additional source of funds for less well-resourced schools in developing countries, or can be used to support social projects in the community by better resourced schools.

The competition since its launch in 2011 has benefited over 80,000 young people directly from over 90 countries and has been recognized internationally for its positive social impact, including as one of the [[World_Innovation_Summit_for_Education|WISE]] Awards 2014 finalists.

{{Companies law}}

'''Sociedad anónima deportiva''' ("Public limited sports company") is a special type of [[public limited company]] in [[Spain]]. The new legal status was introduced in 1990&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csd.gob.es/csd/asociaciones/6SAD/ (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; to improve financial management and transparency in sports clubs. Many Spanish [[Association football|football]] and [[basketball]] clubs add the suffix '''S.A.D.''' to the end of their official name, e.g. [[Atlético Madrid|Club Atlético de Madrid, S.A.D.]].

Every club which plays in [[Segunda División]] or [[Liga ACB]] and remains in the league is obliged to convert to S.A.D. status.

For historical reasons, [[Athletic Bilbao|Athletic Club]], [[FC Barcelona]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]] were allowed to retain their status as non-commercial sports associations.

'''Stefano Casiraghi''' (8 September 1960 &amp;ndash; 3 October 1990) was an [[Italians|Italian]] speedboat racer, [[socialite]], and businessman. He was the son of Giancarlo Casiraghi and Fernanda Biffi, and became the second husband of [[Caroline, Princess of Hanover|Princess Caroline of Monaco]]. He was famous for having set a speed record in speedboat racing and was at the time of his death in a racing accident, the world champion of [[offshore powerboat racing]].

==Early life==
The son of Giancarlo Casiraghi (d. 1998), a businessman and  Fernanda (née Biffi), Stefano Casiraghi grew up in the Casiraghi family's estate, Villa Cigogne, in [[Fino Mornasco]].&lt;ref name="biographie"&gt;[http://stefanocasiraghi.chez.com/ ''Biographie de Stefano Casiraghi''.]&lt;/ref&gt; He had two brothers, Marco and Daniele (died in 2016), and one sister, Rosalba.&lt;ref name="biographie"/&gt; He also developed an early passion for the speedboat races on [[Lake Como]].&lt;ref name="people"&gt;Reed, J.D.; Joel Stratte-McClure and Logan Bentley. [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113334,00.html "Another Tragedy for Monaco"], ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', 15 October 1990. Accessed 7 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He followed the course of his brothers by enrolling at [[Milan]]'s [[Bocconi University]]. However, his eagerness to work in business was stronger than his wish to have a degree, or his skills to obtain one,&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;Fowler, Glenn. [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/04/obituaries/stefano-casiraghi-30-husband-of-caroline-of-monaco-is-killed.html Stefano Casiraghi, 30, Husband of Caroline of Monaco, is killed], ''The New York Times'', 4 October 1990. Accessed 7 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and he left the university after only two years of study, to begin to work for his father and his oldest brother, Marco.&lt;ref name="biographie"/&gt;

==Business==
He was involved in the real estate and retail export enterprises of the family business that his father had built up.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; His [[obituary]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' described him as a [[financier]] and said, at his death, Casiraghi was Chairman of "Cogefar France" (a construction [[subsidiary]] of [[Fiat]]). The same source said he had a majority interest in Engeco, a Monaco-based [[construction]] company which he founded in 1984.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; At the time of his first child's birth, it was said that he was the director of the [[Christian Dior]] boutique in Monte Carlo.&lt;ref name="biographie"/&gt;

== Speedboat racing ==

A self-styled "throttle man,"&lt;ref&gt;''Private Lives'', published by Oxmoor House, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-8487-1024-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casiraghi participated in eighty [[Offshore powerboat racing|offshore]] races during his lifetime. Over a 20-year career, he won a dozen of those competitions and, at the time of his death, was the world champion of offshore speedboat racing, including the World Championship held off the coast of [[Atlantic City]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;  Casiraghi had set the record (since broken) for 277&amp;nbsp;km/h on [[Lake Como]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="people"/&gt; It is a very dangerous sport, but as Casiraghi once said, "There are more dangerous sports and I believe one should live life to the fullest."&lt;ref name="people"/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
On 29 December 1983 in [[Monaco]], he and Princess Caroline married in a civil ceremony in the Hall of Mirrors of the Monegasque Princely Palace. They were not able to have a Catholic ceremony because Caroline had been divorced from [[Philippe Junot]], and an annulment had not yet been obtained. However, as Caroline was over three months pregnant, the couple did not want to wait any longer.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Her father, [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Prince Rainier III]] was by all accounts initially suspicious of his new son-in-law as were many others. The Italian papers called Casiraghi "Carolino" and portrayed him as a mere plaything for his wife.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The couple had three children: [[Andrea Casiraghi|Andrea]] (born 8 June 1984), [[Charlotte Casiraghi|Charlotte]] (born 3 August 1986), and [[Pierre Casiraghi|Pierre]] (born 5 September 1987). The children are, respectively, fourth, eighth and eleventh in the [[line of succession to the Monegasque throne]], after their twin cousins and their mother. Despite their parents' not having married in the Church as required for legitimacy under church (but not Monagasque) law, they were legitimised by [[Pope John Paul II]] in February 1993, eight months after their mother's marriage to Junot was [[annulled]] in June 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Knightley |first1=Emma |title=Princely Monaco XXI: The House of Grimaldi in the 21st Century |isbn=9780359058945 |edition=Kindle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Casiraghi was killed in an offshore powerboat racing accident off the coast of [[Monaco]] near [[Cap Ferrat]] on 3 October 1990 while defending his world offshore title.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; He was 30 years old and had planned to retire after the race. Only weeks earlier, he had escaped death when his boat blew up off the coast of [[Guernsey]].&lt;ref name="kurth"&gt;Kurth, Peter. [http://www.peterkurth.com/Monaco1.htm "In the House of Grimaldi"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927064324/http://www.peterkurth.com/Monaco1.htm |date=27 September 2011 }}, ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three to four-foot wave conditions on the race course, which caused Casiraghi's 42-foot [[catamaran]], ''Pinot di Pinot'', to flip.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;  Traveling at ca. 150&amp;nbsp;km/h,&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; it did not have a full canopy, and experts who studied the accident have said that Casiraghi would most likely have survived the accident had the boat been equipped with such a canopy. As a result of his death, safety laws became more stringent; a [[safety harness]] and closed hull became compulsory, as was a twin hull design for boats. Races nowadays take place close to the harbor where waves are gentler, which is policed off for safety reasons as boats are no longer allowed to drive near the course.

Of the tragedy, [[Anne Edwards]] wrote that Casiraghi and his copilot, Patrice Innocenti, had been "trying to make up for time they had lost earlier in the race when they had stopped to rescue a pilot whose vessel had caught fire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Anne|title=The Grimaldis of Monaco|date=1993|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0006374697|page=17|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrice Innocenti, survived the accident. He was pulled from the water and taken to Monaco's Princess Grace Hospital.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

The funeral Mass was held in Monaco's Cathedral of St. Nicholas exactly eight years after Princess Grace's funeral in the same place.&lt;ref&gt;Tarraborelli, J. Randy :''Once Upon a Time: Behind the Fairy Tale of Princess Grace and Prince Rainier ''. Warner Books, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-446-61380-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stefano Casiraghi is buried in the Chapelle de la Paix in [[Monaco]], which is also the resting place of his wife's paternal grandfather, [[Pierre de Polignac|Prince Pierre of Monaco]].

[[File:Fund Structure.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Structure of a private equity or hedge fund, which shows the carried interest and [[management fee]] received by the fund's investment managers. The [[general partner]] is the financial entity used to control and manage the fund, while the [[limited partner]]s are the individual investors who receive their return as [[capital gain|capital interest]].&lt;ref name=Fleischer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fleischer|first=Victor|title=Two and Twenty: Taxing Partnership Profits in Private Equity Funds|journal=New York University Law Review|date=2008|ssrn=892440|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Private equity]] funds and [[hedge fund]]s are private investment vehicles used to pool investment capital, usually for a small group of large institutional or wealthy individual investors.  They are subject to favorable regulatory treatment in most jurisdictions from which they are managed, which allows them to engage in financial activities that are off-limits for more regulated companies.  Both types of fund also take advantage of generally applicable rules in their jurisdictions to minimize the tax burden on their investors, as well as on the fund managers.  As media coverage increases regarding the growing influence of hedge funds and private equity, these tax rules are increasingly under scrutiny by legislative bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Knoll, ''Article: The Taxation of Private Equity Carried Interests: Estimating the Revenue Effects of taxing Profit Interests as Ordinary Income'', 50 WM. &amp; MARY L. REV. 115, 117 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  Private equity and hedge funds choose their structure depending on the individual circumstances of the investors the fund is designed to attract.

==Basic structure: U.S. domestic fund==
A private equity or hedge fund located in the [[United States]] will typically be structured as a [[limited partnership]], due to the lack of an entity-level tax on [[partnership]]s and other [[flow-through entity|flow-through entities]] under the [[Taxation in the United States|U.S. tax system]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally, subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, Title 26 of the U.S. Code.&lt;/ref&gt;  The limited partners will be the institutional and individual investors.  The general partner will be an affiliate of the manager of the fund.  Typically, the manager of the hedge fund is compensated with a fee based on 2% of the gross assets of the fund, and a profits interest entitling the manager (or, more typically, its affiliated general partner) to 20% of the fund's return (subject, in many cases, to minimum guaranteed returns for the limited partners).&lt;ref name=Marples&gt;{{cite news|last=Marples|first=Donald|title=Taxation of Hedge Fund and Private Equity  Managers|url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS22689.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2014|newspaper=[[Congressional Research Service]]|date=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carried interest==
{{See also|Carried interest}}
Because the manager is compensated with a profits interest in the fund, the bulk of its income from the fund is taxed, not as compensation for services, but as a return on investment.  Typically, when a partner receives a profits interest (commonly referred to as a "carried interest"), the partner is not taxed upon receipt, due to the difficulty of ascertaining the present value of an interest in future profits.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Campbell v. United States (8th Cir. 1981).  This approach was adopted as a general administrative rule by the IRS in a notice in 1993, and again in proposed regulations in 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the partner is taxed as the partnership earns income.  In the case of a hedge fund, this means that the partner defers taxation on the income that the hedge fund earns, which is typically ordinary income (or possibly short-term capital gains), due to the nature of the investments most hedge funds make.  Private equity funds, however, typically invest on a longer horizon, with the result that
income earned by the funds is long-term capital gain, taxable to individuals at a maximum 20% rate.  Because the 20% profits share typically is the bulk of the manager’s compensation, and because this compensation can reach, in the case of the most successful funds, enormous figures, concern has been raised, both in Congress and in the media, that managers are taking advantage of tax loopholes to receive what is effectively a salary without paying the ordinary 39.6% marginal income tax rates that an average person would have to pay on such income.&lt;ref name=Marples/&gt;  To address this concern, Congressman [[Sander M. Levin]] introduced {{USBill|110|H.R.|2834}}, which would eliminate the ability of persons performing investment adviser or similar services to partnerships to receive capital gains tax treatment on their income. However, the Treasury Department has suggested, both in testimony before the Senate Finance
Committee&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance.senate.gov/hearings/testimony/2007test/071107testes.pdf Microsoft Word - 07.11.07 TESTIMONY Solomon on Carried Interest.doc] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726015950/http://finance.senate.gov/hearings/testimony/2007test/071107testes.pdf |date=July 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in public speaking engagements,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|last=Donmoyer |first=Ryan J. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=alm0Crt0eICY |title=News |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; that altering the tax treatment of a single industry raises tax policy concerns, and that changing the way partnerships in general are taxed is something that should only be done after careful consideration of the potential impact.

Congressman [[Charles B. Rangel]] included a revised version of H.R. 2834 as part of the "Mother of All Tax Reform" and the 2007 House extenders package. A line item on taxing carried interest at ordinary income rates was included in the Obama Administration's 2008 Budget Blueprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/asset.aspx?AssetId=793 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090227032520/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/fy2010_new_era/A_New_Era_of_Responsibility2.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-02-27 |title=See page 122 of the White House version of "A New Era of Responsibility - Renewing America’s Promise" |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 2009, Congressman Levin introduced a new and substantially revised version of the carried interest legislation as {{USBill|111|H.R.|1935}}. On May 28, 2010, the House approved carried interest legislation as part of amendments to the Senate-passed version of {{USBill|111|H.R.|4213}}.&lt;ref name=hr4016&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4016: Carried Interest Fairness Act of 2012|publisher=Democrats of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means]]|url=http://democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/bill/hr-4016-carried-interest-fairness-act-2012|accessdate=17 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234019/http://democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/bill/hr-4016-carried-interest-fairness-act-2012|archivedate=18 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 14, 2012, Congressman Levin introduced {{USBill|112|H.R.|4016}}.&lt;ref name=hr4016/&gt;

==Publicly traded partnerships==
In mid-2007, the Blackstone group, a major private equity fund, went public.  Ordinarily, a publicly traded partnership is taxed as a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 7704(a) (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  There is, however, an exception for publicly traded partnerships earning only “passive-type” income, such as interest and dividends.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 7704(c) (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the investments made by a private equity fund are actively managed, Blackstone took the position that the investments they engaged in fell squarely within literal language of this exception to the usual treatment for publicly traded partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donmoyer |first=Ryan J. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aLT1S7eAbIQg |title=News |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2007-03-29 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To address what they viewed as a loophole in the law, Senators Baucus and Grassley introduced S. 1624, which would remove the ability for publicly traded partnerships performing asset-management and related services to avoid being taxed as
corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:s1624is.txt.pdf |title=FDsys - Browse Congressional Bills |publisher=Frwebgate.access.gpo.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The result of this bill would be to change the tax treatment of private equity and hedge funds from a single level of taxation at a 15% rate (or 35% in the case of most hedge funds) to a corporate-level tax of 35%, plus a 15% tax on dividends when distributed.  While acknowledging that there are concerns with the current treatment of publicly traded partnerships, Treasury Secretary Paulson has declined to endorse the treatment that would be provided under S. 1624.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The House extenders package included a carried interest provision that would apply to publicly traded partnerships beginning in tax years after 31 December 2009.

Various private equity and hedge fund managers followed Fortress, the first fund manager to go public as a PTP.  The funds include Oaktree, [[Blackstone Group]], [[Och-Ziff]], [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]], [[Apollo Global Management]], and [[Carlyle Group]].

=="Blocker" corporations==
{{Main|Blocker corporation}}
Although a partnership structure is advantageous for most investors due to the elimination of an entity-level tax, it is not the desired form for all investors.  In particular, foreign investors and domestic tax-exempt organizations both have reasons to prefer to interpose a corporation in the private equity or hedge fund structure.&lt;ref name=Marples/&gt;

Foreign investors are generally not required to file tax returns unless they have “effectively connected income,” derived from the active conduct of a U.S. trade or business.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 871 &amp; 881 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Passive investment in a corporation does not give rise to a U.S. trade or business.  However, active investment management of the type performed by private equity funds or hedge funds typically does.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 864 (2007) and regulations thereunder&lt;/ref&gt;  Because partners in a partnership are treated as engaged in whatever business the partnership itself is engaged in, this means that if a foreign investor invests in a hedge fund or private equity fund, it will generally be forced to file a U.S. tax return.  To avoid this requirement, a foreign investor will often invest through a [[blocker corporation]] (usually located in the Cayman Islands or another offshore jurisdiction).  The corporation itself will be required to file U.S. tax returns, and will pay taxes at the normal U.S.
corporate tax rate, but the foreign investor will receive only dividends or capital gains from the blocker, and will therefore not be required to file a U.S. return.  As an alternative to the “blocker” structure, hedge funds seeking to attract foreign investors can also structure as partnerships, but simply restrict themselves to activities that are not treated as a U.S. trade or business.  For example, U.S. tax law provides that trading in securities for the taxpayer’s own account will not constitute a U.S. trade or business.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. 864(b) (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus foreign hedge funds formed as corporations do not generally pay corporate income tax.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys T, Man A. (2006). [http://www.executiveview.com/knowledge_centre.php?id=1376 Introduction to US Tax Aspects of Hedge Fund Formation]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}. Morrison &amp; Foerster LLP.&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic tax-exempt entities face similar concerns when investing in funds structured as partnerships.  While tax-exempt on income related to their tax-exempt purpose, tax exempt entities are required to file tax returns and pay income tax on “unrelated business taxable income,” commonly referred to as UBTI.  Because the activities of an entity structured as a partnership flow through to its investors, if the partnership receives income that would be UBTI in the hands of the tax-exempt investor, the investor is forced to file an income-tax return and pay unrelated business income tax. To avoid this requirement, tax exempt entities use offshore blocker corporations in much the same way foreign investors do.&lt;ref name=Marples/&gt;  To date, no bill has been introduced to change this treatment, although concerns over the tax gap have led to increased scrutiny of business structures involving offshore corporations in general. For example, in May 2007, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing about offshore structures
used for tax evasion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance.senate.gov/sitepages/hearing050307.htm Finance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627180810/http://finance.senate.gov/sitepages/hearing050307.htm |date=June 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9833">The '''Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy''' ('''UDRP''') is a process established by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICANN]]) for the resolution of disputes regarding the registration of internet [[domain names]].  The UDRP currently applies to all [[Generic top-level domain|generic top level domains]] ([[.com]], [[.net]], [[.org]], etc...),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/en/udrp/ ICANN – Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policies]&lt;/ref&gt; some [[country code top-level domains]], and some older top level domains in specific circumstances.

==Historical background==
When ICANN was first set up, one of the core tasks assigned to it was "The Trademark Dilemma",&lt;ref&gt;See US Government White Paper http://www.icann.org/en/about/agreements/white-paper&lt;/ref&gt; the use of trade marks as domain names without the trademark owner's consent.  By the late 1990s, such use was identified as problematic and likely to lead to consumers being misled.  In the United Kingdom, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] described such domain names as "an instrument of fraud".&lt;ref&gt;British Telecommunications plc v One in a Million Ltd [1999] 1 WLR 903, [[Aldous LJ]] at 920.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of ICANN's first steps was to commission the United Nations [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) to produce a report on the conflict between trademarks and domain names.  Published on 30 April 1999, the WIPO Report&lt;ref&gt;The Management of Internet Names and Addresses: Intellectual Property Issues, 30 April 1999. http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/amc/en/docs/report-final1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; recommended the establishment of a "mandatory administrative procedure concerning abusive registrations", which would allow for a "neutral venue in the context of disputes that are often international in nature."  The procedure was not intended to deal with cases with competing rights, nor would it exclude the jurisdiction of the courts.  It would, however, be mandatory in the sense that "each domain name application would, in the domain name agreement, be required to submit to the procedure if a claim was initiated against it by a third party&lt;ref&gt;See WIPO Mandatory Uniform UDRP Administrative Dispute Procedure. http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/processes/process1/report/finalreport.html#IV&lt;/ref&gt;

The WIPO Report sets out the now familiar three stage test of the UDRP.

Following adoption by ICANN, the UDRP was launched on 1 December 1999, and the first case determined under it by WIPO was ''World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc v. Michael Bosman'', involving the domain name worldwrestlingfederation.com&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/1999/d1999-0001.html WIPO Domain Name Decision: D1999-0001]. Wipo.int. Retrieved on 2014-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===How it is made mandatory===
When a registrant chooses a domain name, the registrant must "represent and warrant", among other things, that registering the name "will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party", and agree to participate in an [[arbitration]]-like proceeding should any third party assert such a claim.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

==Process==
A complainant in a UDRP proceeding must establish three elements to succeed:

* The domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a  [[trademark]] or [[service mark]] in which the complainant has rights; 
* The registrant does not have any rights or legitimate interests in the domain name; and 
* The domain name has been registered and the domain name is being used in "[[bad faith]]".

In a UDRP proceeding, a panel will consider several non-exclusive factors to assess bad faith, such as:

* Whether the registrant registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the domain name registration to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or service mark;
* Whether the registrant registered the domain name to prevent the owner of the trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name, if the domain name owner has engaged in a pattern of such conduct; and 
* Whether the registrant registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business of a competitor; or 
* Whether by using the domain name, the registrant has intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, internet users to the registrant's website, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant's mark.

The goal of the UDRP is to create a streamlined process for resolving such disputes. It was envisioned that this process would be quicker and less expensive than a standard legal challenge. The costs to hire a UDRP provider to handle a complaint often start around [[United States dollar|US$]]1,000 to $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | title = InterNIC &amp;#124; FAQs on the UDRP
 | url = http://www.internic.net/faqs/udrp.html
 | accessdate = 2009-10-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a party loses a UDRP proceeding, in many jurisdictions it may still bring a lawsuit against the domain name registrant under local law.  For example, the administrative panel's UDRP decision can be challenged and overturned in a U.S. court of law by means of e.g. the [[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]]. If a domain name registrant loses a UDRP proceeding, it must file a lawsuit against the trademark holder within ten days to prevent ICANN from transferring the domain name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cybersquatting.com An Informational Website About Cybersquatting Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The UDRP process has already been used in a number of well-known cases, such as [http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2000/d2000-0847.html ''Madonna Ciccone, p/k/a Madonna v. Dan Parisi and "Madonna.com"'']. In this case, the arbitration panel found against the defendant registrant based on all three of the above factors and ordered the domain name turned over to Madonna.

Often there is contention over similar but not identical domain names, in which the offended party files a court action claiming [[trademark]] or [[copyright infringement]]. For example, actor [[Robert De Niro]] has claimed ownership of all domain names incorporating the text "[[Tribeca]]" for domain names with any content related to film festivals. In particular, he has a dispute with the owner of the website http://tribeca.net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cinematical.com/2007/01/02/robert-de-niro-raging-bully/ | title = Robert De Niro: Raging Bully? | date = 2 January 2007 | last = Davis | first = Erik | website = Cinematical}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12312006/gossip/pagesix/pagesix.htm |title=I am Tribeca, De Niro claims |date=31 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403050416/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12312006/gossip/pagesix/pagesix.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domain name disputes under new gTLDs==
In 2012, ICANN launched a process to create [[.events|new generic top-level domains]]. Over 1,900 applications were made. As part of the expansion of the domain name system, ICANN introduced a number of new brand protection mechanisms.  Opinions differ as to whether or not these new processes will be effective.  Industry commentators predict that the UDRP will continue to be used, and that there will be a "substantial increase in cybersquatting".&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg BNA, Cyberlaw Predictions 2013, http://www.bna.com/cyberlaw-predictions-2013-b17179871639/&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence from previous expansions of the namespace, however, indicates the continued dominance of .com both in size and as the first-choice domain for cybersquatting (based on number of disputes).&lt;ref&gt;"Previous expansions of the namespace have failed to capture the public imagination or to pose a competitive threat to the gorilla in the market, .com.  According to WIPO, of 42,000 UDRP filings to date, 80% were for .com domains, and of the new gTLDs, only .info has attracted any volume of UDRP disputes (3% of cases filed)." http://www.emilytaylor.eu/2013/01/online-brand-protection-what-to-expect.html#.UQqKlL9Wx8E&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unissued stock''' is stock that has been authorized in a company's [[charter]], but has never been sold. It differs from [[Treasury stock]] (in the UK, Treasury shares, as treasury stock means something else), in that treasury stock has been issued, and bought back by the company, whereas unissued stock has never been issued.
