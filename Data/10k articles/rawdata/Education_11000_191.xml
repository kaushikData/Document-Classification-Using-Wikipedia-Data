'''AdapTV''' is the world's first dedicated to the mobility impaired, hearing impaired, and visually impaired.
AdapTV initially launched as a network of [[low power broadcasting]] stations (LPTV) that all carried the same programming, with the flagship station being [[KALTV]] in [[St. Louis, MO]].

==History==
In late 2011 AdapTV sold or closed down most of its LPTV stations in order to raise funds for and concentrate on a national cable television launch.
In mid 2012, AdapTV began broadcasting in cable markets nationwide. Some viewers who received AdapTV's low power signal are no longer able to receive the channel as their cable company does not carry it leading to a large volume of requests for a relaunch of LPTV stations in those markets or internet streaming of the channel. Officials for the network stated that the latter is in the works.

Prior to AdapTV, the Silent Network and Kaleidescope TV both served all or part of this audience. The Silent Network featured programming with open captioning and sign-language for the [[hearing impaired]] and [[deaf]] starting in 1980.  The network was later purchased by a private group in San Antonio, TX  who eventually transformed the channel into Kaleidescope TV which was envisioned as a channel for viewers of visual, hearing, mobility and other impairments but later became a general health network before ceasing to broadcast several years later.

==Programming==
Programming on AdapTV is as diverse as general entertainment networks and broadcast channels for the general viewing community.

Sports

[[Deaflympics]]

The network covers live or tape delayed coverage of most sporting events, open and closing ceremonies for the Deaflympics, the Olympics sanctioned sporting event held every four years. The next Deaflympics starts June 23, 2013 in Sofia, Bulgaria

[[Paralympics]]

The Paralympics is a major international sporting event for athletes with physical and mobility difficulties andcarried live and in repeats on AdapTV.

[[Wheelchair racing]]

AdapTV carries Wheelchair Racing every Sunday afternoon as part of its sports block.

News

AdapTV has the US's only open-captioned news broadcasts and also includes sign-language intrepretation and audio description for the visually impaired. All major news stories are covered as well as stories of special interest to AdapTV viewers. Sign-language intrepretation has been available on news broadcasts internationally for years including a special programming block on the [[BBC]] which AdapTV also carries.

Films and Series

Kids TV

AdapTV provides a wide variety of children's programming including films, cartoons, educational series and more for children who are hard of hearing or deaf, visually impaired or blind or physically or mobility challenged. As well the network seeks to reach the friends of these children and help create an inclusive environment. Much of the programming is produced by AdapTV, colleges for the hearing and visually impaired and the [[BBC]]

Events

[[Miss Deaf America]]

Miss Deaf America is the precursor to the Miss Deaf International event. The pageant is broadcast live on AdapTV.

[[Miss Deaf International]]

The next Miss Deaf International will be broadcast live from Sophia on AdapTV from July 23–27 as it is a multi-day event.
Due to the time difference the pageant will be carried live and with tape delay during US primetime hours.

==Formats==
Open [[Captioning]]

Most programming on AdapTV features open-captioning. This means that viewers do not need to turn on captioning when watching the channel. AdapTV uses enhanced open captioning which uses larger letters and a white background making text much easier to read.

[[Sign Language]] Interpretation

Most programming on AdapTV features sign-language intrepretation if it is not featuring sign language as the main content of the programming. Sign-language interpretation

[[Audio description]]
While as of 2013 a contested Federal mandate in the US requires audio description on certain programming AdapTV has chosen to provide audio description of most of its television programming. Unlike other networks the audio description does not require that viewers activate the service and rather it plays during the main audio feed.

'''''Ahlquist v. Cranston''''' (2012) was a case where the [[United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island]] ruled that a "School Prayer" banner posted in [[Cranston High School West]] was a violation of the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] and ordered its removal. The suit was brought by Mark Ahlquist on behalf of his minor daughter [[Jessica Ahlquist]], a student at the school, with the assistance of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].&lt;ref name="HuffPo Article"&gt;{{cite news| last = Winston| first = Kimberly

==Banner==
When [[Cranston High School West]] was opened in 1959, its student council was charged with selection of a school prayer along with its school creed, colors, and mascot. The prayer, adopted in 1960, replaced the [[Lord's Prayer]] in daily recitation until 1962, following the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]''. Banners bearing both the school creed and prayer were gifts from the school's first graduating class (1963), and were affixed in the school auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Thomas A. Lewis|title=Rhode Island: A Resident Hears Dissent in Roger Williams' State |url=http://religionandpolitics.org/2012/07/19/rhode-island-a-resident-hears-dissent-in-roger-williams-state/|accessdate=29 December 2014|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the prayer reads:

{{quote|Our Heavenly Father.

Grant us each day the desire to do our best.&lt;br&gt;
To grow mentally and morally as well as physically.&lt;br&gt;
To be kind and helpful to our classmates and teachers.&lt;br&gt;
To be honest with ourselves as well as with others.&lt;br&gt;
Help us to be good sports and smile when we lose as well as when we win.&lt;br&gt;
Teach us the value of true friendship.&lt;br&gt;
Help us always to conduct ourselves so as to bring credit to Cranston High School West.

Amen.|School Prayer|Cranston High School West}}

==Plaintiffs==
{{main|Jessica Ahlquist}}
Jessica Ahlquist was born in 1995, and lives in Cranston, Rhode Island. Her father, Mark Ahlquist, was co-plaintiff as parent, guardian, and [[next friend]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news| title = Student Faces Town's Wrath in Protest Against a Prayer| first = Abby| last = Goodnough|author2= Jen McCaffery (contributing)| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/27/us/rhode-island-city-enraged-over-school-prayer-lawsuit.html| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| issn = 0362-4331| date = January 26, 2012| accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
In July 2010, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) sent a letter to [[Cranston School District]] superintendent on behalf of an unnamed parent who complained about the banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Brown| first = Stephen| publication-date = July 6, 2010| title = Letter to Superintendent| type = letter| publisher = Rhode Island Chapter ACLU| url = http://www.riaclu.org/documents/CranstonschoolprayerdisplayletterJuly62010.pdf| accessdate = January 29, 2012| format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, school officials thought the banner could be modified, avoiding the prohibitive expense of a lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahlquist had noticed the banner in her first year in high school. After reading about the complaint, she decided to sit in on the school board meetings. She also created a Facebook page&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.facebook.com/groups/179298715436387/| title = Facebook page: "Support the Removal of the Cranston High School West Prayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; to raise support for the cause. At an August 2010 meeting of the Cranston School Committee, a subcommittee was asked to make recommendations about the disposition of the banner; Ahlquist attended the public meetings of the subcommittee in November 2010 and February 2011. At the end of the November meeting, out of safety concerns, a police escort was provided for Ahlquist and one other person who spoke in favor of the banner's removal.&lt;ref name=ruling&gt;{{cite court| litigants = Ahlquist v.

The Rhode Island chapter of the ACLU asked Ahlquist if she would serve as a plaintiff in a lawsuit.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; The suit was filed in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Civil Liberties Union]], ''[http://www.riaclu.org/201104042.htm ACLU Files Suit Over Cranston School Prayer Banner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218230302/http://www.riaclu.org/201104042.htm |date=2012-02-18 }}'' 4th April, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Cranston School Committee had made defense arrangements with [[Joe Cavanagh|Joseph V.

District Court Judge [[Ronald R. Lagueux]] issued a decision in favor of Ahlquist on January 11, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Winston| first = Kimberly| title = Judge rules against prayer banner in R.I. school| newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]| date = January 13, 2012&lt;!--was https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/judge-rules-against-prayer-banner-in-ri-school/2012/01/13/gIQA6rOjwP_story.html but now removed--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was in part based on the Establishment Clause of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s earlier rulings in ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'' (1971), ''[[Lynch v. Donnelly]]'' (1984), and ''[[Lee v.

==Aftermath==
At the hearing, Lagueux remarked that Ahlquist "is clearly an articulate and courageous young woman, who took a brave stand, particularly in light of the hostile response she has received from her community". Following the ruling on the case, police involvement has increased, both escorting Ahlquist to classes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Rhode Island Teen's Battle Against Prayer Banner Has Gone 'Too Far,' Mayor Says| first = Christina| last = Ng| url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/rhode-island-teens-battle-prayer-banner-mayor/story?id=15386786| publisher = ABC News| date = January 18, 2012| accessdate = January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and investigating threats, mostly originating in Cranston.&lt;ref name="police" /&gt; An unnamed student was disciplined by the school because of threats.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Cranston student disciplined over comments against fellow student in prayer banner case; student walkout thwarted Friday| last = Armental| first = Maria| url = http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2012/01/cranston-west-s-2.html| newspaper = Providence Journal| date = January 16, 2012| accessdate = January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local florists also refused a delivery to Ahlquist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Florist found in Connecticut to deliver roses to Cranston West prayer banner opponent / Poll| first = Paul| last = Davis| url = http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2012/01/cranston-floris.html| newspaper = Providence Journal| date = January 19, 2012| accessdate = January 20, 2012| quote = After florists in Cranston and Warwick refused, a Connecticut florist agreed to deliver the flowers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two high school students from other states have described their objections to [[school prayer]] as inspired by her activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Metcalf |first=Andrew |publication-date=June 24, 2012 |title=Ahlquist Inspires Two Others To Contest Prayers At Their Schools |work=Cranston Patch |url=http://cranston.patch.com/articles/ahlquist-inspires-two-others-to-contest-prayers-at-their-schools |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707205224/http://cranston.patch.com/articles/ahlquist-inspires-two-others-to-contest-prayers-at-their-schools |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 7, 2012 |accessdate=January 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bachelor of Integrated Studies''' ('''BIS''') is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] [[bachelor's degree]] offered by several universities in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It allows students to design a customized and specific course of study to best suit their educational and professional objectives. Generally, this degree is sponsored by two or more [[Academic department|departments]] within the university. Schools which confer the degree include the [[University of North Texas]], [[Northern Kentucky University]], [[Utah Valley University]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uvu.edu/is/ Integrated Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miami University in Ohio]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://miamioh.edu/regionals/academics/departments/ics/academics/majors/integrative-studies/index.html Bachelor of Integrative Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pittsburg State University]], [[George Mason University]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://integrative.gmu.edu/ School of Integrative Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weber State University]], [[Washburn University]], [[Ferris State University]], [[Jacksonville State University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsu.edu/degreelist.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kennesaw State University]], [[Oakland University]], [[Nevada State College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsc.nevada.edu/888.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312010520/http://nsc.nevada.edu/888.asp|title=Integrated Studies - Your Degree, Your Way.|archivedate=12 March 2012|deadurl=yes|publisher=Nevada State College|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dixie State University]], and the [[University of New Brunswick]], [[Florida Gulf Coast University]], among others. 

According to materials issued by Weber State University:&lt;blockquote&gt;The program best suits students who have developed a sense of their educational and life goals, and who are looking for ways to express those goals through a self-designed and self-directed university program. The BIS Program serves the needs of students who want to individualize or create a unique academic program; students who want to obtain a broad [[liberal education]]; and/or students who want to prepare for specific career goals and/or [[graduate school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weber.edu/BIS/program.html|title=Weber State University BIS Program|author=|date=|website=weber.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Belgrade Planetarium''' ({{lang-sr|Београдски планетаријум|Beogradski planetarijum}}) is one of two [[planetarium]]s in [[Serbia]]. It is located in [[Belgrade]] and is operated by the [[Astronomical Society Ruđer Bošković]]. Before 1967 it was known as the "Turkish bath in Lower Town".&lt;ref name="Politika"&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Daliborka Mučibabić | title = Umesto javnog kupatila - kulturni centar | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages = 17 | language = Serbian | date = 18 July 2017 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The edifice was originally built as the [[Turkish bath]] (''hamam''), in the Lower Town section of the [[Belgrade Fortress]]. It was constructed between 1860 and 1867, when Ottomans left the fortress. During the [[World War I]] it was used as the military bath. The building was almost demolished as the result of the 1944 explosion in the nearby East Gate of the fortress.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;

After the city Institute for the protection of the cultural monuments was founded, the Institute initiated the reconstruction of the ''hamam'' in 1962, citing the building's "undisputed monumental properties". The reconstruction was finished in 1964 and the venue remained unused until 1967. The planetarium of the [[Astronomical Society Ruđer Bošković]] was installed in 1967-68.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;

The planetarium's instrument, little [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]]'s planetarium [[ZKP-2]] (Zeiss Kleine Planetarium-2), was purchased at the [[Belgrade Fair]] of technology in 1966 thanks to [[Josip Broz Tito]], after an initiative of the members of the Society. Unofficially, it started working in 1969, and officially in the 1970. The planetarium's hall has a diameter of eight meters and eighty seats.

The main visitors to the planetarium are students of Belgrade primary and high schools. Following periodic activities of the Society are taking place in the Planetarium:
* Astronomy courses for beginners (spring and autumn; in spring of 2007, the eightieth course was held)
* Belgrade Astronomical weekend
* Summer astronomy meetings

==Organisation==
{{Intelligent Design}}
The Centre for Intelligent Design's activity is organised under a charitable trust governed by the laws of Guernsey, [[Channel Islands]], but (as of October 2010) consists of only a website and an office.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{Cite news|title=UK Centre for Intelligent Design claims it will focus on science, not religion|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/oct/01/centre-intelligent-design-science-religion|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 October 2010|accessdate=13 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the Centre is not to finance or undertake research into intelligent design, but rather to conduct advocacy and public relations for the idea.&lt;ref name=BSCE&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Centre for Intelligent Design – Britain's Latest Creationist Organisation|url=http://www.bcseweb.org.uk/index.php/Main/CentreForIntelligentDesign|publisher=[[British Centre for Science Education]]|date=27 November 2010|quote=The Centre for Intelligent Design does not propose to either undertake or finance research into Intelligent Design.

==Controversy==
Commenting on the Centre for Intelligent Design, [[Michael Reiss]] as Professor of Science Education at the [[Institute of Education]], [[University of London]], said that the overwhelming scientific consensus is that the arguments against the theory of evolution promoted by intelligent design advocates are invalid, and students should not be given a false impression about the subject.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

In November 2010 the [[British Centre for Science Education]] reported on a potential of the Centre for Intelligent Design to damage education in Scotland as well as in Northern Ireland, due to lack of safeguards against creationism and the power of the creationist organisations.&lt;ref name="BSCE"/&gt;

In April 2011 an article was published in the Scottish newspaper ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' which said that "critics have pointed to the leaders’ [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christian]] backgrounds and the leaps of faith inherent in their logic." Its president was quoted as saying that he believed [[Adam]] was a real person, that the universe was created in six days, and that the story of [[Noah]] and the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] was historical.&lt;ref name=heraldscotland/&gt; Its director denied that the idea that the initial spark creating the universe was caused by a [[Intelligent designer|universal engineer]] or [[God]] was religious.&lt;ref name=heraldscotland/&gt;

'''Chartered Certified Accountant''' (designatory letters '''ACCA''' or '''FCCA''') is a protected designation awarded by the '''[[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]]''' ('''ACCA'''). The Association is UK based and was historically an organisation of [[British qualified accountants]], however it is now a global body for professional accountants with 208,000 qualified members allowed to use the designation and 503,000 students globally.  Support offices/centres exist over 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accaglobal.com/uk/en/about-us.html|title=Global body for professional accountants - Accountancy - About Us|website=www.accaglobal.com|publisher=Association of Chartered Certified Accountants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term ''Chartered Certified Accountant'' was introduced in 1996.  Prior to that date, [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] members were known as ''Certified Accountant.''  It is still permissible for an ACCA member to use this term. Members of ACCA with post-qualification experience of more than five years and have completed the required continued professional development are designated Fellows, and use the designatory letters FCCA in place of ACCA.

The term ''Chartered'' refers to the [[Royal Charter]] granted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of the [[United Kingdom]].

Chartered Certified Accountants work in all fields of business and finance. Some are engaged in public practice work, others work in the private sector and some are employed by government bodies.

Since ''Chartered Certified Accountant'' is a legally protected term, individuals who describe themselves as such must be members of ACCA. If they carry out public practice engagements, they must comply with additional regulations such as holding a practising certificate, being [[professional indemnity insurance|insured]] against any possible liability claims and submitting to inspections.

==Syllabus==
The current syllabus is made up of 13 examinations, although some exemptions are available. The papers are split into two levels:
* The Applied Knowledge level: 3 examinations consisting of 
** AB - Accountant in Business
** MA - [[Management Accounting]]
** FA - [[Financial Accounting]]
* The Applied Skills level: 6 examinations consisting of 
** LW - Corporate and Business Law
** PM - Performance Management
** TX - [[Taxation]]
** FR - [[Financial Reporting]]
** AA - [[Audit]] and Assurance
** FM - [[Finance|Financial Management]]
* The Strategic Professional level - 6 examinations consisting of 
** Two compulsory papers:
*** SBL - Strategic Business Leader
*** SBR - Strategic Business Reporting
** Four optional papers, of which two must be selected:
*** AFM - Advanced Financial Management
*** APM - Advanced Performance Management
*** ATX - Advanced Taxation
*** AAA - Advanced Audit and Assurance

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3058">The '''Consortium on Financing Higher Education''' ('''COFHE''') is an organization of thirty-five private [[college]]s and [[universities]]. Formed in the mid-1970s, COFHE is an unincorporated, voluntary, institutionally-supported organization of 35 highly selective, private liberal arts colleges and universities,  all of which are committed to meeting the full demonstrated financial need of admitted students.  

The Consortium’s data collection, research, and policy analysis focus on matters pertaining to access, affordability, and assessment, particularly as they relate to undergraduate education, admissions, financial aid, and the financing of higher education. All data supplied to, compiled by, and shared among the Consortium are subject to strict confidentiality guidelines.  
   
The organization's officially stated goals are as follows:

*Collecting from and reporting to the member institutions historical data relating to admission, financial aid, and costs.
*Conducting periodic and special studies, as desired, to investigate aspects of institutional policy and administrative practices.
*Convening meetings of the membership for general policy and research discussions of broad interest and import.
*Monitoring developments within the federal government and the private sector as these developments relate to the financing of higher education, with specific emphasis on financial aid and student loan programs.
*Cooperating and coordinating with other organizations concerned with higher education.

COFHE's home office is located at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a Washington office is housed at Johns Hopkins's [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies]] in the District of Columbia. The president of COFHE as of November 1, 2018 is Janet Rapelye.  From 2002 to October 2018, the president was Kristine Dillon. Preceding her was Katharine Hanson, 1976-2002.

The '''Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology''' (DIT) is one of the high learning institutions in [[Tanzania]]. Originally established in 1957, it is fully accredited by the [[National Council for Technical Education]] (NACTE) to offer [[technician]] and [[engineering]] programmes leading to the awards of Ordinary Diploma(OD) in engineerig, [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (BEng) respectively and Master of Engineering(MEng).

==History==
In 1957, the '''Dar es Salaam Technical Institute''' was established charged with providing vocational training. It quickly expanded to offer technical secondary school courses. In 1962 it became the '''Dar es Salaam Technical College''', and in 1964 began offering courses in engineering and other related professional areas, leading to Full Technician Certificates. It gradually added more advanced courses and degrees and in 1997 it became the Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Brief History About DIT - Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology|url=http://www.dit.ac.tz/history.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departments==
The Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology has six academic departments, as follows; 
# [[Civil Engineering]]
# [[Computer Engineering]]
# [[Electrical Engineering]]
# Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, 
# [[Mechanical Engineering]]
# Science and Laboratory Technology.

==Admission==
There are two basic admission procedures for both Bachelor of Engineering and Ordinary Diploma students, these being Direct entry and Indirect entry.
In Direct entry students finishing Secondary education and High school education apply for entry, and if they pass their Secondary or High school exams they are selected to join. All students joining through this scheme are sponsored by the government.
Student failing to join through Direct entry apply for the Indirect entry scheme where they will be given a short course, and those who pass get admitted. Students joining through this scheme must bear all costs (tuition fees, accommodation etc.)

==Master of Engineering==
DIT through the Department of Civil engineering in collaboration with the Department of electrical engineering developed curriculum of Master of Engineering in Maintenance Management (NTA 9) which has been approved by NACTE.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.egov.go.tz/egov_uploads/documents/Information_for_applicants_application_for_DIT_masters_sw.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The programme comprises a total of 17 Modules with a minimum of 150 credits that are spread over two semesters for course work and six months period of dissertation. Each course module is covered in one semester of 17 weeks except for the dissertation, which takes place after the successfully completion of the two semesters. The course work sessions will be carried out during Session II (evening time) starting from 04.00 pm. The training Programme will run for a minimum of 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dit.ac.tz/index.php?item=1&amp;contents=11&lt;/ref&gt;

==The India-Tanzania Center Of Excellency ==
The India-Tanzania Center Of Excellency in ICT (ITCoEICT) was established in 2009 as a result of friendly-relation between two counties and their desire to further strengthen bilateral cooperation in academic disciplines of Information Technology, The project implementing Agencies onbehalf of these two countries are Tanzania Dar es salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) and India Center For Development of Advance Computing (CDAC).
The principal objective of the Center is to promote development of Information and Communication Technology in the United Republic of Tanzania. In order to realize the stated objective, the Centre engages in various professional activities in ICT including provision of video conferencing, telemedicine &amp; e-learning facilities, High Performance Computing and conducting modular short-term proficiency courses in Information Technology. Functional Areas of the Centre The Center is divided in three units:

1. High Performance Computing section

2. Telemedicine &amp; e-Learning section

3. IT Professional Courses section&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dit.ac.tz/index.php?item=9&amp;contents=91&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deeside Consortium''' is a local arrangement in [[Flintshire]], [[North Wales]] between four schools:
* [[John Summers High School|John Summers High]]
* [[Connah's Quay High School|Connah's Quay High]] in [[Connah's Quay]]
* St David's High in [[Saltney]]
* Flint High in [[Flint, Flintshire|Flint]]

The consortium exists to share [[Sixth form|6th form]] education between the four schools. The schools are too small to provide good education in all the [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] courses on offer, so each school specialises.

Each of the regions inside Belarus has oversight of the education system, and students may attend either a public (state) or a private school. The current structure of the educational system was established by decree in 1994. The education system is also based on The Education Code of the Republic of Belarus and other educational standards.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adu.by/en/|title=Home |website=adu.by|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-school education ==
Pre-school education is not compulsory in Belarus, but around 70% of children attend nursery (at the ages 1 to 2) and kindergarten (at the ages of 3 to 5) before they start school.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.belarus.by/en/about-belarus/education|title=Education, Belarus |website=www.belarus.by|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some kindergartens are specialized to work with psycho-physically challenged children to help them socialize.

== Primary and secondary education ==
Education in primary and secondary schools is required for children from the ages of six until fifteen and lasts for 9 years. After finishing basic education, each student must pass the basic educational curriculum and is given a certificate by the state. Then students are able to enter a professional technical institutions where they can focus on completing their high school education and study to get a professional certificate.

Completion of 11 years of school or a professional certificate allows students to enter higher educational establishments or enter professional technical institutions as well; the length of the schooling depends on what the student has chosen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Higher education ==
{{See also|List of universities in Belarus}}
Higher education is in constant growth since 1991. In 2011, 4,725 per 10,000 citizens were undergraduates. Belarus has also adopted the ECTS system, allowing more student mobility.&lt;ref&gt;http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/tempus/participating_countries/overview/belarus_tempus_country_fiche_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Belarus counts 55 higher education institutions (45 state-owned, 10 private).

To enter a higher educational establishment a student must pass three centralized tests (and get up to 100 points per test).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rikc.by/eng/|title=Республиканский Институт Контроля Знаний|website=rikc.by|access-date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two leading establishments of higher education in national education system:
* [[Academy of Public Administration (Belarus)|Academy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus]]
* [[Belarusian State University]]

== Marks ==
A ten-point grading scale has been used since 2002. It is used in primary, secondary and higher education.

The grading scale is divided into five levels:
{| class="wikitable"
!Level
!Grade
!Russian equivalent&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
|-
| rowspan="2" |High
|10
|5+
|-

| rowspan="2" |Satisfactory
|4
|3
|-
|3
|3-
|-
| rowspan="2" |Low

Marks "1" and "2" are considered as "Fail" at school. In higher education, "3" is also considered as "Fail".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7403">'''"Effective Schools"''' is both an educational movement and body of research which examines school-based factors which positively influence learning outcomes in [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] schools.  Effective schools research has been widely adopted by school districts worldwide.

==History==
Early research into the essential qualities of successful schools emerged in North America as a response to the controversial 1966 [[James Samuel Coleman#Coleman Report|Coleman Report]], which concluded that family background and socio-economics were the major determinants of student achievement.  Research published by [[Christopher Jencks]] in 1972 contributed to Coleman's findings, suggesting that "school quality has little effect on achievement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Downer | first = Donovan F. | title = Review of Research on Effective Schools | publisher = McGill Journal of Education | date = Fall 1991 | url = http://mje.mcgill.ca/article/download/7995/5923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raptis"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Raptis | first1 = Helen | last2 = Fleming | first2 = Thomas | title = Reframing Education: How to Create Effective Schools | publisher = C.D. Howe Institute | date = Oct 2003 | url = http://www.cdhowe.org/pdf/commentary_188.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coleman Report prompted U.S. policymakers to focus on "compensatory programs" which focused on changing the behavior of less advantaged students.&lt;ref name="Lezotte"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lezotte | first = Lawrence W. | title = Revolutionary and Evolutionary: The Effective Schools Movement | publisher = Effective School Products | year = 2001 | url = http://www.edutopia.org/pdfs/edutopia.org-closing-achievement-gap-lezotte-article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report also stimulated vigorous reaction from educational researchers who believed, to the contrary, that schools ''could'' make a significant difference on student achievement.  Their research formed the foundation of the 'Effective Schools Movement', and enabled them to assert that "all children can learn and that the school controls the factors necessary to assure student mastery of the core curriculum."&lt;ref name="Lezotte"/&gt;

Early effective schools researchers attempted to locate schools that were successful in educating students of all backgrounds, regardless of socio-economic status or family background.  Such schools were found in varying locations and communities, and researchers tried to isolate which philosophies, policies, and practices those schools had in common.&lt;ref name="Lezotte"/&gt;

[[Larry Lezotte]] and Wilbur B. Brookover conducted studies at eight Michigan elementary schools in the mid-1970s, identifying characteristics of schools that were improving or declining.  A notable finding was that "staff in the declining schools had low opinions of their students' abilities, while the staff in the improving schools had high opinions of student abilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Brookover | first1 = Wilbur B. | last2 = Lezotte | first2 = Lawrence W. | title = Changes in School Characteristics Coincident with Changes in Student Achievement | publisher = Michigan State University | year = 1977 | url = http://education.msu.edu/irt/PDFs/OccasionalPapers/op017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Weber, and later [[Ronald Edmonds]], conducted research in inner-city U.S. schools where students of low socio-economic background were able to equal or surpass the national average.  Edmonds' 1979 article "Effective Schools for the Urban Poor" is noted for drawing professional attention to the effective schools movement.  Edmonds outlined six characteristics essential to effective schools, including:
# Strong administrative leadership.
# High expectations.
# An orderly atmosphere.
# Basic skills acquisition as the school’s primary purpose.
# Capacity to divert school energy and resources from other activities to advance the school’s basic purpose.
# Frequent monitoring of pupil progress.

Educational researchers soon dropped "capacity to divert energy and resources" from the list, and Edmonds' “five-factor model” was widely proclaimed as a framework for reforming low-performing schools.&lt;ref name="Raptis"/&gt;

In 1979, ''Fifteen Thousand Hours'' documented effective schools research in high schools in the United Kingdom, and found that school characteristics could positively alter student achievement.&lt;ref name="Lezotte"/&gt;

Edmonds published "Programs of School Improvement: An Overview" in 1982, describing the "correlates of effective schools", a now widely used phrase commonly associated with the later work of Lezotte.  Edmonds' correlates described effective schools as the following:
# The leadership of the principal notable for substantial attention to the quality of instruction.
# A pervasive and broadly understood instructional focus.
# An orderly, safe climate conducive to teaching and learning.
# Teacher behaviors that convey the expectation that all students are expected to obtain at least minimum mastery.
# The use of measures of pupil achievement as the basis for program evaluation.&lt;ref name="Lezotte"/&gt;

In 1991, Lezotte published ''Correlates of Effective Schools: The First and Second Generation'', describing the "Seven Correlates of Effective Schools":
# Instructional leadership.
# Clear and focused mission.
# Safe and orderly environment.
# Climate of high expectations.
# Frequent monitoring of student progress.
# Positive home-school relations.
# Opportunity to learn and student time on task.

The correlates of effective schools have remained a cornerstone for many school districts.

==Current use==
The Council of Ontario Directors of Education describes Lezotte's seven correlates as "being necessary for ensuring high levels of student achievement", adding that educators should also consider the importance of home and an empathic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Effective Schools | publisher = Council of Ontario Directors of Education | date = June 30, 2011 | url = http://www.ontariodirectors.ca/CODE_Advisories/Downloads/CODE%20Advisory%20No%209%20WEB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[District of Columbia Public Schools]] has broadened its description of effective schools to include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = DCPS Effective Schools Framework | publisher = District of Columbia Public Schools | year = 2011 | url = http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/About+DCPS/Strategic+Documents/Effective+Schools+Framework}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Teaching and Learning.
# Leadership.
# Job-Embedded Professional Development.
# Resources.
# Safe and Effective Learning Environment.
# Family and Community Engagement.
# Data-Driven Decision Making.

==Implementation==
A key finding regarding the implementation of effective schools reforms is that the positive support the school principal is fundamental to success.  Also, teacher support for, belief in, and commitment to a particular reform tended to follow months or years of successful practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calman |first=Ruth C. |title=Exploring the Underlying Traits of High-Performing Schools |publisher=Education Quality and Accountability Office |date=Sep 2010 |url=http://www.eqao.com/Research/pdf/E/ExploringUnderlyingTraits_web.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704140010/http://www.eqao.com/Research/pdf/E/ExploringUnderlyingTraits_web.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''exit examination''' is a test that students in the United States of America must pass to receive a diploma and graduate from school. Such examinations have also been used in a variety of countries; this article focuses on their use within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;For work on the effects of these exams in other countries, see for example, John H. Bishop (1995), "The impact of curriculum-based external examinations on school priorities and student learning." International Journal of Educational Research 23, no. 8: 653-752.&lt;/ref&gt; These are usually [[criterion-referenced test]]s which were implemented as part of a comprehensive [[standards-based education reform]] program which sets into place new standards intended to increase the learning of all students.

When any test is directly tied to significant consequences, such as determining whether the student may receive a [[high school diploma]], it is called a [[high-stakes test]]. Many organizations such as the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] (NCTM) oppose high-stakes tests in general, with the NCTM saying that "placing too much emphasis on a single test or on testing can undermine the quality of education and jeopardize equality of opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nctm.org/about/position_statements/highstakes.htm] High-Stakes Tests, A Position of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, almost all states that hold an exit exam for graduation allow students to take the test multiple times and further allow routes to graduation for students that fail.

In 2011, 24 states required passing a high school exit examination for graduation, and three additional states had legislation instituting such exams in the future.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics, ''Digest of Education Statistics, 2011'', Table 177 [http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d11/tables/dt11_177.asp].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Graduation examinations first appeared in the U.S. after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when the Regents Board of the State of New York imposed its first [[Regents Examinations|exams]].
Outlined a model that a new educational performance standard should be set for all students, to be met by 16. Students passing a series of performance-based assessments that incorporate the standard would be awarded a Certificate of Initial Mastery. This certificate would qualify the student to choose among going to work, entering a college preparatory program, or studying for a Technical and Professional e, which would be explicitly tied to advanced job requirements. These standards would not be intended as sorting mechanisms, but would allow multiple opportunities for success; the goal would simply be to ensure achievement of high performance standards for the great majority of the nation's workforce. The states would ensure that virtually all students achieve the Certificate of Initial Mastery. Most of the current high school examinations are also given for the first time in the 10th grade even if US students are usually not expected to have completed high school until grade 12.

In the United States [[comprehensive high school]] model, all students are expected to complete 12 years of public education, with some students taking primarily vocational based courses, while college-bound students taking primarily academic courses, but education reform seeks to graduate all students with some work experience and enough academic skills to succeed in college.

==Use==
In states that require students to pass a high school graduation test, the students are typically given multiple opportunities to take the test each year, over several years.  For example, in the State of California, students may take the [[California High School Exit Exam]] up to eight times over three years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/hs/cahseeqajune2010.asp#Q6  "CAHSEE Q and A for Parents and Guardians":  6. How many opportunities do students have to pass the CAHSEE?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy about exit exams==
Over time, there has been debate about the use of exit exams.  Opponents of the use of test-based accountability, as typified by the report of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] on the subject, argue that the exams lead to more high school dropouts without increasing student performance.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hout and Stuart W. Elliott, eds. 2011. ''Incentives and test-based accountability in education''. Washington, DC: National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others including [[Eric Hanushek]] have argued that scientific evidence on this is lacking and that the use of these examinations is consistent with the standards movement for educational reform.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hanushek]], "Grinding the antitesting ax:  More bias than evidence behind NRC panel's conclusions." ''Education Next'' 12, no. 2 (Spring 2011): 49-55.[http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/grinding-antitesting-ax-more-bias-evidence-behind-nrc-panels-conclusions]  The specific debate on the high school exit examination can be found in: Eric Grodsky, John Robert Warren, and Demetra Kalogrides, "State High School Exit Examinations and NAEP Long-Term Trends in Reading and Mathematics, 1971-2004," ''Educational Policy'' 23, no. 4 (July 2009): 589-614; John Robert Warren and Eric Grodsky, "No Axe to Grind: A Response to Hanushek," ''Educational Policy'' 26, no. 3 (May): 352-359; and [[Eric Hanushek]], "A flawed analysis of unrepresentative state achievement data," ''Educational Policy'' 26, no. 3 (May 2012): 360-368.[http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/flawed-analysis-unrepresentative-state-achievement-data]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
Students who are unable to pass the exit examinations given by their local public school may be able to use an alternative assessment to demonstrate mastery of the material.

They may also be able to graduate from a private school or a school in another state by transferring their accumulated credits at the end of the last year of school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrightslaw.com/info/advo.diploma.nars.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is typically not free, but is not considered very expensive relative to the cost of hiring an attorney to contest the statewide exams, or to the cost of hiring a private tutor.

[[Denmark|Danish]] [[ballet]] [[dancer]], ballet master and company director.

Born in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], he began training with the [[Royal Danish Ballet]] at the age of nine. He later joined the company as an apprentice at the age of sixteen and was promoted to solo dancer at the age of twenty one.

Kronstam dominated the Royal Danish Ballet's repertory for more than two decades, dancing over 120 roles, many of which were created, such as the role of Romeo in Sir [[Frederick Ashton]]'s ''Romeo and Juliet'' (1955), the Husband in [[John Cranko]]'s Secrets (1956), Nilas in [[Birgit Cullberg]]'s ''Moon Reindeer'' (1958), and the Prince in [[Flemming Flindt]]'s '' The Nutcracker'' (1971).

He succeeded Flemming Flindt as ballet master of the [[Royal Danish Ballet]] in 1978 and was responsible for the planning and direction of the 1979 [[August Bournonville|Bournonville]] Festival as well as for restoring Bournonville, and classical ballet generally, to the center of the company's repertory. He also was a noted teacher and coach. He retired as balletmaster in 1985 but continued to stage and rehearse ballets until 1994. He died suddenly, May 28, 1995, of a pulmonary embolism.

'''''Hotel Giant''''' ({{zh|s=模拟饭店|t=模擬飯店|p=Mó Nǐ Fàn Diàn}}), known in North America as '''''Maximum Capacity: Hotel Giant''''', is a [[business simulation game]] developed by [[Enlight Software]] and published by [[JoWood Productions]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. The soundtrack was composed by [[Bjørn Lynne]].

==Overview==
The play of the game involves developing and managing a hotel. The user starts with a pre-made building to which they add rooms, place useful and decorative objects in the rooms, and set up hotel details such as advertising. Once this has happened, the user opens up the hotel to the public and starts to run it as if it were a real business. It is similar to the "Tycoon" style of game ([[Railroad Tycoon]], [[RollerCoaster Tycoon]], [[Zoo Tycoon]], etc.), in which the player creates a system or establishment and then runs it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/hotel-giant Hotel Giant at Moby Games]&lt;/ref&gt; Hotel Giant 2 offers improved graphics, more features and a new campaign.

==Versions==
There are currently three versions of Hotel Giant. These are:
*Hotel Giant, released 14 May 2002
*Hotel Giant 2, released in UK on 21 November 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/hotelgiantii/index.html Hotel Giant 2 at GameSpot]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hotel Giant DS

==Reception==
''Hotel Giant'' received a "Gold" sales award from the [[Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association]] (ELSPA),&lt;ref name=goldelspa&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319031650/http://www.elspa.com/?i=3943 |url=http://www.elspa.com:80/?i=3943 |title=ELSPA Sales Awards: Gold |work=[[Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association]] |archivedate=19 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=gamasutrasales&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918063107/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/112220/ELSPA_Wii_Fit_Mario_Kart_Reach_Diamond_Status_In_UK.php |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/112220/ELSPA_Wii_Fit_Mario_Kart_Reach_Diamond_Status_In_UK.php |title=ELSPA: ''Wii Fit'', ''Mario Kart'' Reach Diamond Status In UK | author=Caoili, Eric | date=November 26, 2008 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |archivedate=September 18, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game received a fairly poor reception, with a [[Metacritic]] average of 54%. D+PAD said that any pros were "outweighed by some of the cons, most notably the repetitive and the non-engaging nature of the gameplay."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dpadmagazine.com/2009/02/10/hotel-giant-2 D+PAD&lt;/ref&gt; IT Reviews commented that the game "wasn't much fun" and you'd get "more amusement with an old, second hand copy of [[Sim Tower]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itreviews.co.uk/games/g543.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328120723/http://www.itreviews.co.uk/games/g543.htm |archivedate=28 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }} IT Reviews&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for Scientific Information''' ('''ISI''') was founded by [[Eugene Garfield]] in 1960. It was acquired by [[Thomson Scientific &amp; Healthcare]] in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Thomson Corporation acquired ISI | journal = [[Online (magazine)|Online]] | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-12394745.html |date = July 1992 | accessdate = 2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became known as '''Thomson ISI'''. It was a part of the Intellectual Property &amp; Science business of [[Thomson Reuters]] until 2016, when the IP &amp; Science business was sold, becoming [[Clarivate Analytics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipscience.thomsonreuters.com/news/ip-and-science-launched-as-independent-company/|title=PR Newswire|author=|date=|website=ipscience.thomsonreuters.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, Clarivate announced it will re-establish ISI as part of its Scientific and Academic Research group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://clarivate.com/blog/news/back-future-institute-scientific-information-re-established-within-clarivate-analytics/|title=Back to the Future: Institute for Scientific Information Re-established Within Clarivate Analytics|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISI offered [[bibliographic database]] services. Its specialty: [[citation index]]ing and analysis, a field pioneered by Garfield. It maintains citation databases covering thousands of [[academic journal]]s, including a continuation of its longtime print-based indexing service the [[Science Citation Index]] (SCI), as well as the [[Social Sciences Citation Index]] (SSCI), and the [[Arts and Humanities Citation Index]] (AHCI). All of these are available via ISI's [[Web of Knowledge]] database service. This database allows a researcher to identify which articles have been cited most frequently, and who has cited them. The database provides some measure of the academic impact of the papers indexed in it, and may increase their impact by making them more visible and providing them with a quality label. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that appearing in this database can double the number of citations received by a given paper.&lt;ref&gt;Diego Varela (2013) 'The contribution of ISI indexing to a paper's citations: results of a natural experiment', ''European Political Science'' 12(2): 245-253; published online 5 October 2012; [https://dx.doi.org/10.1057/eps.2012.29 doi: 10.1057/eps.2012.29].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISI also publishes the annual ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'' which list an [[impact factor]] for each of the journals that it tracks. Within the scientific community, journal impact factors play a large but controversial role in determining the kudos attached to a scientist's published research record.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A list of over 14,000 journals is maintained by the ISI. The list includes some 1,100 arts and humanities journals as well as scientific journals. Listing is based on published selection criteria and is an indicator of journal quality and impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Master Journal List  | publisher = Thomson Scientific | url =http://scientific.thomson.com/mjl/  | accessdate = 2007-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISI publishes ''Science Watch'', a newsletter which identifies every two months one paper published in the previous two years as a "fast breaking paper" in each of 22 broad fields of science, such as [[Mathematics]] (including [[Statistics]]), [[Engineering]], [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], and [[Physics]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The designations are based on the number of citations and the largest increase from one bimonthly update to the next. Articles about the papers often include comments by the authors.

The ISI also publishes a list of "ISI highly cited researchers", one of the factors included in the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] published by [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]].

== ISI Highly Cited ==
{{split section|ISI Highly Cited|date=September 2016}}
{{main cat|ISI highly cited researchers}}

"ISI Highly Cited" is a database of "highly cited researchers"—scientific researchers whose publications are most often [[citation|cited]] in [[academic journal]]s over the past decade, published by the Institute for Scientific Information. Inclusion in this list is taken as a measure of the esteem of these academics and is used, for example, by the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]].

The methodology for inclusion is to consider papers in the upper first percentile based on citation counts&lt;ref&gt;[http://highlycited.com/info.htm#details Welcome to Highly Cited Researchers], retrieved July 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; of all articles indexed in the Scientific Citation Databases and published in a single, fixed year. Papers in the upper first percentile with respect of their year of publication are called highly cited papers. Each paper in the data is assigned to one or more of 21 categories, based on the ISI classification of the journal in which the article was published. The Highly Cited Researchers list is compiled by selecting, in every field, those researchers with the highest number of highly cited papers in a 10-year, rolling time period. The number of highly cited researchers varies from field to field and is determined accordingly to the total number of researchers contributing to the single field.

The categories are as follows:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
*Agricultural Sciences
*Biology &amp; Biochemistry
*Chemistry
*Clinical Medicine
*Computer Science
*Ecology/Environment
*Economics/Business
*Engineering

*Microbiology

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2394">'''Institutional pedagogy''' is a practice of [[education]] that is centered on two factors: 1. the complexity of the learner, and the "[[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]" that he or she brings to the classroom. This unconscious is another name for the diversity of social, economic, cultural and other unspoken elements that an educator interacts with in an institutional setting; and 2. the role of the institution in the process of intervening in both those psycho-social factors and in what is known by a student.

But even more than this, as conceived by its founder, [[Fernand Oury]], Institutional Pedagogy is a constant calling into question of the institutional context itself. Thus the classroom is never a presupposed and static setting. The movement of Institutional Pedagody is thus in direct opposition to the prevailing trends of education prior to the late 1960s, almost all of which tended to homogenize socio-cultural differences amongst learners, psycho-social factors in learning and most important the presence of the "unconscious" in the classroom itself.

Thus the use of '[[institution]]' in Institutional Pedagogy is broader than in its more colloquial sense. To Oury the institution could be defined as:

''"the places, moments, status of each according to his/her level of performance, that is to say according to his/her potentialities, the functions (services, posts, responsibilities), roles (president, secretary), diverse meetings (team captains, different levels of classes, etc.), and the rituals that maintain their efficacy."''

'''Japanese language education in Kazakhstan''' dates back to 1992; the [[Japan Foundation]]'s 2006 survey showed 51 teachers teaching the language to 1,569 students at thirteen institutions in [[Kazakhstan]]; the number of students increased by 38% as compared to the 2003 survey and more than triple the number in the 1998 survey.&lt;ref name="1998Survey"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Japan Foundation|title=1998年海外日本語教育機関調査結果: カザフスタン (Results of the 1998 survey of overseas Japanese language educational institutions: Kazakhstan)|url=http://www.jpf.go.jp/j/japan_j/oversea/kunibetsu/1999/kazakhstan.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070623221422/http://www.jpf.go.jp/j/japan_j/oversea/kunibetsu/1999/kazakhstan.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-06-23|date=2004|accessdate=2008-01-14}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2003Survey"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Japan Foundation|title=2003年海外日本語教育機関調査結果: カザフスタン (Results of the 2003 survey of overseas Japanese language educational institutions: Kazakhstan)|url=http://www.jpf.go.jp/j/japan_j/oversea/kunibetsu/2004/kazakhstan.html|date=2004|accessdate=2008-01-14| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060103195115/http://www.jpf.go.jp/j/japan_j/oversea/kunibetsu/2004/kazakhstan.html| archivedate = January 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2003Survey"/&gt;

==History==
Japanese language education in Kazakhstan formally began with the 1992 establishment of a Japanese language course at [[Almaty]]'s [[Al-Farabi University]]; [[Kazakh National Technical University]], Kazakh University of International Relations, Kazakh National Pedagogical University, [[Almaty Management University]], and two other [[List of universities in Kazakhstan|universities in Kazakhstan]] &lt;!-- 労働社会関係アカデミー東洋学部 and 国立ユーラシア大学 --&gt;soon followed. Courses at the elementary and secondary levels were established several years later; two schools began offering Japanese classes in 1996, followed by another three in 1998 and an additional four schools after 2000. However, by 2003, four of the primary and secondary programmes were terminated due to lack of teaching staff, while an additional two universities and one non-school institution began to offer Japanese language courses. For students in primary and secondary schools, Japanese language classes might begin as early as the fifth year of compulsory education, proceeding until the eighth or the eleventh year.&lt;ref name="2006Survey"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Japan Foundation|title=2006年海外日本語教育機関調査結果: カザフスタン (Results of the 2006 survey of overseas Japanese language educational institutions: Kazakhstan)|url=http://www.jpf.go.jp/j/japan_j/oversea/kunibetsu/2006/kazakhstan.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070623221422/http://www.jpf.go.jp/j/japan_j/oversea/kunibetsu/2006/kazakhstan.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-06-23|date=2006|accessdate=2008-01-14}} &lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, Kazakhstan had 43 teachers of Japanese, among whom eight were native speakers. Students majoring in Japanese faced problems such as low wages and lack of opportunities to use their skills in professional contexts, leading to limits on the growth of interest in the language.&lt;ref name="Sugiura"/&gt;

Much language study is funded not indigenously, but rather through a portion of the [[United States dollar|US$]]95 million in official development assistance provided by [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], as well as additional private aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference&lt;!--|title=Japanese Policies in Relation to Kazakhstan: Is There a "Strategy"--&gt;|pages=165–186|last=Uyama|first=Tomohiko|title=Thinking Strategically: The major Powers, Kazakhstan, and the Central Asian Nexus|editor=Robert H. Legvold|publisher=The MIT Press|date=2003|isbn=0262621746}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no unified national curriculum for Japanese studies at either the primary, secondary, or tertiary levels; rather, institutions design their own curricula, typically with the aid of, and using textbooks published by, the Japan Center, which is also funded by the Japanese government.&lt;ref name="Sugiura"/&gt;

The [[Japanese Language Proficiency Test]] has been offered in Kazakhstan since 2003, solely in the former capital of [[Almaty]]. The number of examinees fell every year for the first two years after the test's introduction, but in 2006, their count more than doubled; the number of people taking the introductory 4th-level examination nearly quadrupled. However, [[JETRO]]'s Business Japanese Test was not offered in Kazakhstan or any other [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] member state {{As of|2006|lc=on}}.&lt;ref name="JETROStats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/bjt/data/jlrt/pdf/res13report_en.pdf|format=[[PDF]] |title=13th JLRT (2006): A Summary Report|publisher=[[Japan External Trade Organization]]|date=2006|accessdate=2006-12-01| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192906/http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/bjt/data/jlrt/pdf/res13report_en.pdf| archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jorge Eliecer Gaitan Museum''' (aka '''Casa Museo Jorge Eliecer Gaitan''') is a [[museum]] in [[Bogota]], [[Colombia]], dedicated to the life of assassinated politician [[Jorge Eliecer Gaitan]].&lt;ref name="tripadvisor"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g294074-d9463317-Reviews-Casa_Museo_Jorge_Eliecer_Gaitan-Bogota.html | title=Casa Museo Jorge Eliecer Gaitan | publisher=[[TripAdvisor]] | accessdate=31 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The house [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán Ayala]] lived in from the beginning of the 1930s until the day of his murder on April 9, 1948, is located on Calle 42 No. 15 (42nd Street # 15), 52 of the Santa Teresita neighborhood in [[Bogotá]].{{fact|date=October 2016}} It was also part of the design planned in 1928 for this area by the “Davila Holguin &amp; Lievano” firm. It was declared as a National Monument by Decree 1265 in 1948, and has been managed by the [[Universidad Nacional de Colombia]] since the year 2005

==Exhibitions==
This two-story museum has an area of 218 square meters. Each space gives information on how life was in a 1930s home located in one of Bogota’s most developed neighborhoods.{{fact|date=October 2016}} Each of the objects that belong to its collection tell the story of he who was called “The People’s Tribune” (Tribuno del pueblo), due to his everlasting struggle to help the poor classes within the Colombian society.
From this museum, it is possible to approach the country’s main historical events during the mid-Twentieth Century. Each visitor can interact with the tour guides by asking questions and sharing information, as is the case of those who go to know this leader in person.

==Collections==
The museum has Jorge Eliécer Gaitán Ayala’s personal library, including more than three thousand books in different languages.{{fact|date=October 2016}} During the tour, visitors can learn about his political and social contributions, as well as daily life as is shown by his personal objects.
Another part of the museum is the Jorge Eliécer Gaitán Complex, including the garden where this leader's body was “planted”. There, standing, and looking towards the Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino in Santa Marta, with soil from every Colombian town, and having been showered with water from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s and the [[Magdalena River]], the body rests since 1988, after having been buried within the house for 40 years.

==Visitors==
The visitors study give information on the opinions and interests of the Jorge Eliécer Gaitán House Museum, in relation to different activities held and future expectations.{{fact|date=October 2016}}
This study has been carried out since 2006 and is shared by the Claustro San Agustín. An important fact is that most visitors are between 11 and 25 years old, especially school and college students from different parts of the country.{{fact|date=October 2016}} For visitors 70 years and above, the museum is a place where they can once again encounter the past, sharing experiences and memories with younger people.

'''Kevin P. Chavous''' (born May 17, 1956) is an attorney, author, education reform activist, and former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politician in [[Washington, D.C.]], in the United States. He served as a member of the [[Council of the District of Columbia]] from January 1993 to January 2005, and was an unsuccessful candidate for [[Mayor of the District of Columbia]] in 1998.

==Early life and education==
Chavous was born in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]],&lt;ref name=sanchezstability /&gt; the son of Bettie J. and Harold P. Chavous.&lt;ref name=sanchezstability /&gt; His father was a [[pharmacist]] and his mother a civil rights activist.&lt;ref name=sanchezstability /&gt; Chavous was the oldest of four children.&lt;ref name=sanchezstability /&gt; His first job was working at Chavous Drugs, his father's drug store, sweeping and mopping floors and stocking shelves.&lt;ref name=sanchezstability&gt;{{cite news |last=Sanchez |first=Rene |title=Stability, Success Mark Chavous's Life |work=The Washington Post |date=September 1, 1998 |page=D01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chavous was educated at [[Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School]] in Indianapolis and [[Wabash College]] in [[Crawfordsville, Indiana]],&lt;ref name=sanchezstability /&gt; where he earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kevin Chavous, Democrat |work=The Washington Post |date=September 9, 2004 |page=T15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While at Wabash, he was [[NCAA Division III]] District All-American in basketball.&lt;ref name=primary2000&gt;{{cite news |title=Democratic Primary: Council Ward 7 |work=The Washington Post |date=September 7, 2000 |page=J18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavous also earned a [[Juris doctor|JD]] degree from the [[Howard University School of Law]] in Washington, D.C., where he was president of his law school class.&lt;ref name=sanchezstability /&gt; He is a member of [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] fraternity.&lt;ref name=primary2000 /&gt;

==Community activism==
After graduating from law school, Chavous became a [[personal injury lawyer]] for the D.C. law firm of Cadeaux &amp; Tagliere.&lt;ref name=sanchezstability /&gt; The Chavouses and their children lived in [[Hillcrest, Washington, D.C.|Hillcrest]], an affluent neighborhood in [[Southeast, Washington, D.C.|Southeast Washington]] on the District-[[Maryland]] border.&lt;ref name=sanchezstability /&gt;

In May 1988, Chavous was elected to the [[District of Columbia Democratic State Committee]], representing Ward 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sherwood |first=Tom |title=Jackson's Landslide Falls Short of Hopes: Lack of D.C. Organization Cited |work=The Washington Post |date=May 5, 1988 |page=D1 |postscript=none}}; {{cite news |title=District Election Primary Results: Democratic Primary |work=The Washington Post |date=May 19, 1988 |page=J6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[Pepco]], an [[electric power]] [[public utility]], proposed a significant expansion of its coal-fired power generating plant on the edge of the [[River Terrace, Washington, D.C.|River Terrace]] neighborhood in Ward 7. The River Terrace Community Organization, a group representing citizens living in the neighborhood, opposed the plant, and Chavous agreed to represent the group in court ''[[pro bono]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hamilton |first=Martha M. |title=Expansion of Pepco Plant In NE Washington Opposed |work=The Washington Post |date=February 15, 1989 |page=D3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=loebtouts&gt;{{cite news |last=Loeb |first=Vernon |title=Chavous Touts Record on Schools |work=The Washington Post |date=August 25, 1998 |page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pepco cancelled the expansion in 1991, and Chavous gained significant visibility for his work.&lt;ref name=loebtouts /&gt;

Chavous also joined the national board of directors of [[Brady Campaign|Handgun Control, Inc.]], a group working for strong federal [[gun control]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kevin Chavous |work=The Washington Post |date=September 12, 1998 |page=DC2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1992 council race and term==

===1992 council race===
The Pepco fight launched Chavous' political career.&lt;ref name=loebtouts /&gt; Chavous, who by now was hosting a once-a-week program on legal issues on radio station [[WCSP-FM|WDCU-FM]], announced in May 1992 that he would challenge incumbent Ward 7 Councilmember [[H. R. Crawford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harriston |first=Keith |title=Kelly Spokesman Rebuts Accusation That Homicide Figures Were Withheld |work=The Washington Post |date=May 28, 1992 |page=J3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported, was facing strong criticism from voters from his legislative achievements and three Democratic [[primary election]] challengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harriston |first=Keith |title=Crawford Battling Challengers and Criticism |work=The Washington Post |date=September 8, 1992 |page=D8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harristontaps&gt;{{cite news |last=Harriston |first=Keith |title=Chavous Taps Discontent, Ousts Crawford in Ward 7: Batch of Endorsements Can't Save Incumbent |work=The Washington Post |date=September 16, 1992 |page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavous waged an intensive grassroots campaign to unseat Crawford. According to ''The Washington Post'', Chavous visited every single-family residence in Ward 7 personally, either speaking with members of the household or leaving behind campaign literature.&lt;ref name=harristontaps /&gt; On September 15, 1992, Chavous unseated Crawford, 4,866 votes (41.7 percent) to 4,266 (37 percent).&lt;ref name=harristontaps /&gt; In the [[general election]] on November 3, 1992, Chavous easily defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate Johnnie Scott Rice, 96 percent to 4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sanchez |first=Rene |title=District Rejects Death-Penalty Measure |work=The Washington Post |date=November 4, 1992 |page=A33 |postscript=none}}; {{cite news |title=District: Key to the Vote Results |work=The Washington Post |date=November 5, 1992 |page=C11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First council term===
Chavous was sworn in on January 2, 1993.&lt;ref name=sanchezoffice&gt;{{cite news |last=Sanchez |first=Rene |title=Barry Takes Office As Supporters Cheer: Others on Council, School Board Sworn In |work=The Washington Post |date=January 3, 1993 |page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his first term on the council, Chavous aligned with Ward 2 council member [[Jack Evans (D.C. politician)|Jack Evans]] (elected in 1991), At-Large council member [[William Lightfoot]] (elected in 1988), and Ward 6 council member [[Harold Brazil]] (elected in 1991) to form a caucus known as the "Young Turks". Together, they successfully opposed tax increases sought for the city by Mayor [[Sharon Pratt Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodlee |first=Yolanda |title=In Ward 7, Council 'Baby' Grows Up Fast |work=The Washington Post |date=December 5, 1993 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 22, 1993, an unidentified gunman sprayed the public swimming pool at the Benning Park Recreation Center with fire from a semiautomatic weapon.

Pool; 6 Children Wounded in Chaotic Scene |work=The Washington Post |date=June 23, 1993 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident highlighted the high level of gun violence in Ward 7, and ''The Washington Post'' said Chavous was thrust into the citywide spotlight by it.&lt;ref name=loebtouts /&gt; Chavous personally brought his two young children to the pool (which had seen almost no visitors since the attack) on June 29 to demonstrate the pool's safety and send a message of defiance to drug dealers and violent criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Donnell |first=Santiago |title=With Pride, Fear, They Jump Back In |work=The Washington Post |date=June 30, 1993 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 26, 1993, four-year-old Launice Smith was shot in the head and head (and survived) while her family watched a pick-up football game at Weatherless Elementary School in the [[Fort Dupont]] neighborhood in Ward 7. Smith was injured when four gunmen emerged from a nearby woods and then hunted down and executed 20-year-old Kervin Brown in what [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia|D.C. police]] said was part of an ongoing battle between rival drug gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=DeNeen L. |last2=Castaneda |first2=Ruben |title=Police Say Turf Wars Fueled Day of Violence |work=The Washington Post |date=September 27, 1993 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once more, Chavous was seen as one of the most important political leaders responding to violence in the city. On September 29, he announced for the formation of a 20-member task force on public safety and began pushing for Ward 7 residents to police their own neighborhoods and report drug dealing, crime, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Hamil |title=SE Communities Uniting to Battle Decay |work=The Washington Post |date=September 30, 1993 |page=DC1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavous later called the task force one of the most important developments of his first term.&lt;ref name=loebtouts /&gt;

Among other key legislative accomplishments in his first term&lt;ref name=loebtouts /&gt; was a 1993 act allowing the city to seize abandoned vehicles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Hamil |title=Bill Takes Aim at Trash Disposal Offenders |work=The Washington Post |date=April 15, 1993 |page=J1 |postscript=none}}; {{cite news |last=Sewell |first=Chan |title=Liquor Bill Dominates D.C.

(The cut was temporary, and expired in 1996.)&lt;ref name=schneidervise /&gt;

Chavous' legislative activism declined significantly over his first term.  Chavous told ''The Washington Post'' in February 1996 that "it has proved easier to wait for someone else, be it the mayor or the control board, to propose hard solutions," according to journalists Howard Schneider and David A. Vise.&lt;ref name=schneidervise /&gt; He unsuccessfully supported in 1995 a package of [[conservatism|conservative]] Republican Party proposals to significantly change the way the city provided [[welfare]] benefits, and a plan to create an independent school board to approve and oversee [[Charter schools in the United States|charter schools]].&lt;ref name=schneidervise /&gt; One significant (and eventually successful) change he advocated was the creation of a [[District of Columbia Financial Control Board]] to save the city from bankruptcy. He was one of the first council members to call for federal oversight (in early 1995), although later in the year he refused to vote to cut big-ticket items such as unemployment benefits or the city's summer youth jobs program.&lt;ref name=schneidervise&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schneider |first1=Howard |last2=Vise |first2=David A. |title=Tough on Talk, Soft on Action |work=The Washington Post |date=February 19, 1996 |page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress created a financial control board in April 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Janofsky |first=Michael |title=Congress Creates Board to Oversee Washington, D.C. |work=The New York Times |date=April 8, 1995 |accessdate=November 1, 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/08/us/congress-creates-board-to-oversee-washington-dc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1996 reelection and second council term==

===1996 council race===
Chavous sought reelection in 1996. He faced a challenger in the Democratic primary election, [[District of Columbia State Board of Education|District of Columbia Board of Education]] member Terry Hairston. In July 1996, Hairston challenged Chavous' right to be on the ballot. D.C. election law required a candidate to obtain signatures from at least 250 voters in a ward in order to run for a district council seat in that ward. Chavous submitted signatures from 574 voters. But D.C. law also required that all individuals gathering such signatures be residents of the District of Columbia, and Hairston alleged that Chavous campaign worker Calvin S. Hawkins did not meet that condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chavous Faces Ballot Challenge |work=The Washington Post |date=July 25, 1996 |page=B4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[District of Columbia Board of Elections]] ruled in Chavous' favor on July 30, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Challenger's Complaint Rejected |work=The Washington Post |date=July 31, 1996 |page=B5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Democratic primary held on September 10, 1996, Chavous easily defeated Hairston and another challenger, Eddie Rhodes, winning 68 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Vanessa |title=Brazil Sweeps Away Yeldell's Challenge |work=The Washington Post |date=September 11, 1996 |page=A1 |postscript=none}}; {{cite news |title=District: Primary Election Results |work=The Washington Post |date=September 11, 1996 |page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavous won 90 percent of the vote in the general election on November 5, easily beating [[D.C. Statehood Green Party|D.C. Statehood Party]] candidate Durand A. Ford (6 percent) and Republican Party candidate James Bernard Miles (3 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Vanessa |title=Brazil, Schwartz Win Handily In D.C.

===Second council term===
On December 30, 1996, Chavous was elected chairman of the Council's Committee on Education, Libraries and Recreation.&lt;ref name=harrisclarke&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Hamil R. |title=Clarke Hospitalized For Tests, Aide Says |work=The Washington Post |date=December 31, 1996 |page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ward 3 council member [[Kathleen Patterson|Kathy Patterson]], a veteran education activist, also fought for the chairmanship. Patterson strongly criticized Chavous' commitment to educational reform, but Council Chairman [[David A. Clarke]] awarded the post to Chavous after he publicly declared education reform to be the biggest issue facing the sity.&lt;ref name=loebtouts /&gt; Patterson, however, won an agreement that stripped jurisdiction over labor issues from Chavous' committee and gave it to the Committee on Government Operations (chaired by Patterson).&lt;ref name=harrisclarke /&gt; During his first year in office, the [[District of Columbia Public Schools]] undertook an emergency $50 million project to repair leaking and structurally unsound roofs at several public schools. The project was significantly mismanaged, and forced a delay in the opening of the school year. Chavous ordered a hearing on the issue in September 1997, but a significant number of parents of schoolchildren complained he had not provided enough oversight and acted too late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Vanessa |title=Chavous Takes Some Heat Over D.C. Council Inaction: His Leadership on Schools Crisis Is Questioned |work=The Washington Post |date=September 29, 1997 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1997, Chavous sponsored another significant piece of legislation,&lt;ref name=loebtouts /&gt; a resolution disapproving a construction contract for the highly controversial [[Barney Circle#Barney Circle Freeway fight|Barney Circle Freeway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Loeb |first=Vernon |title=Norton Declares Barney Circle Freeway a Dead End |work=The Washington Post |date=March 5, 1997 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chavous also opposed construction of a [[Walter E. Washington Convention Center|new convention center]] in the city. As late as May 27, 1998, Chavous said he had not decided whether to support the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harris |first1=Hamil R. |last2=Woodlee |first2=Yolanda |title=Candidates Feel Their Way in Debate |work=The Washington Post |date=May 28, 1998 |page=D4}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he voted to oppose it during the council's vote on June 2, arguing that plans to build a convention center smaller than many then under construction was "a plan to build a second-tier convention center".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Montgomery |first1=David |last2=Evans |first2=Judith |title=Convention Center Wins Council Vote: District Would Finance $685 Million Project |work=The Washington Post |date=June 3, 1998 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his losing mayoral campaign, Chavous became what ''The Washington Post'' called a "frequent critic" of the new mayor, Anthony A. Williams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cottman |first1=Michael H. |last2=Lipton |first2=Eric |title=Mayor's Budget Plan Is Met With Anger |work=The Washington Post |date=March 16, 1999 |page=B01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had "the chilliest relationship with the mayor" of any Council member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Vanessa |title=Mayor, Council Struggle to Patch Relations |work=The Washington Post |date=August 23, 1999 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavous was an early supporter of Councilmember [[Carol Schwartz]]'s tax cut package in March 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Vanessa |title=Schwartz Proposes Tax Cuts |work=The Washington Post |date=March 4, 1999 |page=B6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became law in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Vanessa |last2=Vise |first2=David A. |title=D.C.

Council Adopts Budget |work=The Washington Post |date=May 12, 1999 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavous also led a nine-month effort to reconstitute and reform the D.C. Board of Education.  After a long battle with Mayor Williams and other Council members, the Council approved a plan to reduce the size of the board, and make four of the nine members subject to mayoral appointment (with Council confirmation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wilgoren |first1=Debbi |last2=Moreno |first2=Sylvia |title=Williams Loses Bid For Control Of Schools |work=The Washington Post |date=January 19, 1999 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters were asked to approve the "hybrid" board, which they did so in a close vote in June 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Vanessa |title=D.C.

School Board Vote Affirmed |work=The Washington Post |date=July 8, 1999 |page=B7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Washington Post'', the bruising school board battle helped and hindered Chavous politically. While his allies said it showed he could tackle tough problems, dissenters argued that Chavous avoided the real issues (lack of money for schools and crumbling infrastructure). Chavous blamed the lengthy legislative process on unnamed individuals who he said did not engage in good faith in the process, but critics argued that Chavous never engaged in the kind of political hardball that was needed to move the reform bill along faster. Larry Gray, legislative chairman of the D.C. Congress of PTAs, blamed Chavous for deep cuts in the school budget during the past four years, failures in the teacher certification program, and significant delays in getting technology into the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Vanessa |title=For Chavous, Bruises in a Scuffle Over Schools |work=The Washington Post |date=February 29, 2000 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private-sector work===
In late 1998, after his campaign for mayor, Chavous left Cadeaux &amp; Tagliere and joined the law firm of [[Arent Fox|Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin &amp; Kahn]].&lt;ref name=williamsfehrwired&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Vanessa |last2=Fehr |first2=Stephen C. |title=Chavous Gets Wired Over His New Job |work=The Washington Post |date=December 16, 1999 |page=DC1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chavous left Arent Fox&lt;ref name=sarasohnarent&gt;{{cite news |last=Saraoshn |first=Judy |title=Bridgestone/Firestone Opens D.C. Office |work=The Washington Post |date=March 22, 2001 |page=A27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed Vice President of Communications for [[Covad]] Communications Group, a [[broadband]] provider, in December 1999.&lt;ref name=williamsfehrwired /&gt; But he left that position after just a year. Citing his somehwat difficult reelection campaign, Chavous said he wanted to devote more time to his Council position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sewell |first1=Chan |last2=Woodlee |first2=Yolanda |title=Chavous Quitting Lobbyist Job |work=The Washington Post |date=December 14, 2000 |page=J2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1998 mayoral campaign==
As early as January 1997, ''The Washington Post'' said, Chavous was running an all-but-announced campaign for mayor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Hamil R. |title=Amid the Politics, New Term Begins: Campaign Rhetoric, Barry Barbs Mark D.C.

As part of a staff shakeup to improve his election chances, Chavous fired Jim Ford, the veteran staff director of the Committee on Education, Libraries and Recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harris |first1=Hamil R. |last2=Wheeler |first2=Linda |title=He's Now a Chief of a Different Sort |work=The Washington Post |date=January 16, 1997 |page=J3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valerie Strauss of ''The Washington Post'' said Ford's dismissal "robbed the committee of its institutional memory and one of its most vocal advocates for school reform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Strauss |first=Valerie |title=Firing Leaves a Void; Council Employee Was Expert on Schools |work=The Washington Post |date=January 30, 1997 |page=DC1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But although Chavous had worked diligently to improve his name recognition and standing with the public, he garnered just 7 percent of those likely voters polled by ''The Washington Post'' in May 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Vanessa |last2=Harris |first2=Hamil R. |title=What? Me Worry? The Mayor Shrugs Off the Polls |work=The Washington Post |date=May 22, 1997 |page=J1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chavous formally announced his campaign for mayor on February 10, 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Powell |first=Michael |title=Chavous Makes It Official, Enters D.C. Mayor's Race |work=The Washington Post |date=February 11, 1998 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised $117,000 in the first month of his campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chavous Raises $117,000 in Mayor's Race |work=The Washington Post |date=March 12, 1998 |page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavous trailed the other leading candidate in the race, Jack Evans, who raised more than $307,000 since early December 1997, as well as restaurateur Jeffrey Gildenhorn, who doanted $400,000 of his own money to his own campaign. More than a third of the campaign contributions to the Chavous campaign came from individuals living outside the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodlee |first=Yolanda |title=Chavous Trails Evans in Donations |work=The Washington Post |date=March 19, 1998 |page=J1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavous said in April 1998 that, if elected, he would focus heavily on education reform. He rejected [[school vouchers]], but promised to fire principals and teachers who did not meet performance standards and create a boarding school for troubled youth. He also said he would disband the police oversight group established by the Financial Control Board, and work to revive commercial areas throughout the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Powell |first=Michael |title=Mayoral Bid Will Center On Schools, Chavous Says |work=The Washington Post |date=April 29, 1998 |page=B8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said he would cut a number of taxes levied by the city, including the [[Corporate tax|corporate income tax]], and seek passage of a federal law that would replace the current progressive federal income tax on city residents with a [[flat tax|flat federal income tax]] of 15 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Powell |first=Michael |title=In D.C. Mayoral Race, Tax Cutting Takes Lead |work=The Washington Post |date=July 21, 1998 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also proposed universal [[early childhood education]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Vanessa |title=Chavous's Emphasis Is Early Education |work=The Washington Post |date=August 8, 1998 |page=B6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and significantly improved city services for Latino residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Vanessa |title=Chavous Pledges Better Services for Latinos |work=The Washington Post |date=August 12, 1998 |page=B4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-May, a ''Post'' poll showed 29 percent of voters favoring a sixth Barry term. Harold Brazil had 16 percent, Kevin Chavous had 15 percent, and Jack Evans had 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Loeb |first1=Vernon |last2=Morin |first2=Richard |title=Survey Shows Barry Ahead of the Pack |work=The Washington Post |date=May 19, 1998 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21, Barry said he would not seek reelection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Loeb |first1=Vernon |last2=Woodlee |first2=Yolanda |title=Barry Says He Won't Seek Another Term |work=The Washington Post |date=May 22, 1998 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was a boost for Chavous, as polling showed that Barry's supporters were most likely to support him over other mayoral candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Hamil R. |title=The Race Is On As D.C. Candidates Scurry to Win Over Barry Backers |work=The Washington Post |date=May 23, 1998 |page=F6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on May 30, 1998, [[Anthony A. Williams]] entered the race for mayor.  Williams was the city's Chief Financial Officer, a position created by the same federal legislation which created the Financial Control Board.  Williams had helped steer the city toward financial solvency, and had proven immensely popular among residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vise |first=David A. |title=Financial Officer to Run for D.C. Mayor |work=The Washington Post |date=May 31, 1998 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early June, the Chavous campaign had raised more than $260,000 in campaign donations in an attempt to reach its $750,000 goal; about 25 percent of the contributions came from non-District residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodlee |first=Yolanda |title=Evans Is Far Ahead In Fund-Raising Race |work=The Washington Post |date=June 11, 1998 |page=D4}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, Chavous barely won a [[straw poll]] of Democrats in Ward 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fehr |first=Stephen C. |title=Mayor Finds Support in Southeast for Tax, Spending Priorities |work=The Washington Post |date=March 30, 2000 |page=B5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Williams came in a close second, in what ''The Washington Post'' called a sign of weakening support for Chavous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Loeb |first=Vernon |title=Democrats In Ward 8 Tilt Slightly to Chavous |work=The Washington Post |date=June 21, 1998 |page=B14}}&lt;/ref&gt; But nine days later, he won the endorsement of the Metropolitan Washington AFL–CIO, a broad coalition of trade unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Powell |first=Michael |title=Chavous Wins Union Backing in Mayor's Race |work=The Washington Post |date=June 30, 1998 |page=D3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, Vickey Wilcher, the manager of Chavous' mayoral campaign, quit amid rumors of infighting among Chavous' top aides. ''The Washington Post'' reported that several top campaign staff were angered by Chavous' "indecisiveness" over the convention center issue. They were also alarmed that Chavous had failed to win the Ward 8 endorsement, and they fought with other campaign managers over the direction of the Chavous effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Vanessa |title=Chavous's Campaign Manager Quits Amid Reports of Discord |work=The Washington Post |date=July 2, 1998 |page=D5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign received another blow a few days later when the influential [[Washington Teachers Union]] broke with the AFL-CIO and endorsed Williams for mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Vanessa |title=Teachers Union Endorses Williams |work=The Washington Post |date=July 10, 1998 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, Chavous raised another $100,000 toward his campaign goal. But Anthony Williams raised more than $400,000—most of it in small donations from voters throughout the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodlee |first=Yolanda |title=Williams Tops 3 Rivals In Recent Fund-Raising |work=The Washington Post |date=August 11, 1998 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavous also loaned his campaign $25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodlee |first=Yolanda |title=2 Lend Money to Their Coffers |work=The Washington Post |date=August 20, 1998 |page=J1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the primary season wound down, a ''Post'' poll released on September 3, 1998, showed Williams with 37 percent of the vote and Chavous with 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Morin |first=Richard |title=Poll Puts Williams in Front |work=The Washington Post |date=September 3, 1998 |page=DC6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, the Washington Teachers Union, D.C. Construction and Building Trades Council, Washington Social Workers Association, D.C. Nurses' Association, and National Hispanic Law Enforcement Association accused Chavous of missing 37 percent of all Council sessions during his first term in office, an accusation Chavous strongly denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cottman |first1=Michael H. |last2=Williams |first2=Vanessa |title=Williams, Chavous Trade Barbs About Participation, Responsibility |work=The Washington Post |date=September 9, 1998 |page=B4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last month of the mayoral race, Williams raised $303,000 compared with just over $77,000 for Chavous. Chavous concluded the race having raised just $450,000 toward his goal of $750,000, and he had only $66,000 for the final week of the campaign compared to Williams' $97,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodlee |first=Yolanda |title=Williams, Evans Lead Pack in Fund-Raising |work=The Washington Post |date=September 9, 1998 |page=B5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Williams won the Democratic primary election held on September 15, 1998. Williams received 50 percent of the vote, with Chavous a distant second at 35 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Powell |first1=Michael |last2=Cottman |first2=Michael H. |title=Williams Wins Mayoral Primary |work=The Washington Post |date=September 16, 1998 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|Williams defeated Chavous in Ward 4 by just 300 votes, his narrowest margin in any of the city's eight wards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chan |first1=Sewell |last2=Leonnig |first2=Carol D. |title=Ward 4 Challenge Targets Key Williams Ally |work=The Washington Post |date=May 31, 2001 |page=T2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Williams easily defeated Republican [[Carol Schwartz]] in the general election on November 4, 66 percent to 30 percent.

==2000 reelection and third term==

===2000 council race===
Chavous announced he would run for a third four-year term on the Council of the District of Columbia in June 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodlee |first=Yolanda |title=Incumbents, 19 Others Enter Council Primary |work=The Washington Post |date=July 6, 2000 |page=B4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His primary campaign faced significant problems. In June, the Far Northeast/Southeast Council, a coalition of [[Advisory Neighborhood Commission]]s (ANC) and neighborhood civic associations, voted "no-confidence" in Chavous, saying he had been absent from too many community meetings and events&lt;ref name=sewellaccused /&gt; and had failed to keep resident informed about major changes in their ward (such as the relocation of the D.C. Department of Employment Services and the opening of a new charter school).&lt;ref name=sewellunderdog /&gt; In late July, the Metropolitan Washington Council of the AFL-CIO declined to make an endorsement in the Ward 7 Council primary race, after the Washington Federation of Teachers accused Chavous of ignoring their input on education policy.&lt;ref name=sewellaccused /&gt; (The teachers union also declined an endorsement in August.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Leonnig |first1=Carol D. |last2=Sewell |first2=Chan |title=Political Nitty-Gritty |work=The Washington Post |date=August 17, 2000 |page=J02}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 4, Chavous had only raised $2,100 in contributions, but spent more than $46,500.

Feenster, a computing analyst.&lt;ref name=sewellunderdog&gt;{{cite news |last=Sewell |first=Chan |title=4 Underdogs Seek to Block Third Term for Chavous |work=The Washington Post |date=August 31, 2000 |page=DCE7}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of August, Chavous had raised $6,000 in new contributions, and said he hoped to raise $20,000 more before the general election.&lt;ref name=sewellunderdog /&gt;

Despite these problems, Chavous won the Democratic primary on September 12. He garnered 53 percent of the vote.&lt;ref name=sewellunderdog /&gt;{{Efn|A later press report pegged his margin at just 51 percent.&lt;ref name=sewellenjoy /&gt;}} His closest challenger was Rev.

Chavous' campaign problems eased during the general election. By October 10, he had raised $66,800, and had $14,000 in cash on hand for the remaining three weeks of the general election campaign. Chavous blamed his reduced electoral margin in the primary on "lingering anger" over the school board reform battle.&lt;ref name=sewellenjoy&gt;{{cite news |last=Sewell |first=Chan |title=In D.C.

===Third council term===
Chavous continued to have a contentious relationship with Mayor Williams in his third term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodlee |first=Yolanda |title=Council Members Fault Report on Williams |work=The Washington Post |date=April 10, 2002 |page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' claimed that Chavous was considering a mayoral run in 2002, and that his battles with Williams were motivated by the search for a campaign issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pierre |first=Robert E. |title=D.C.

"Harold's just become a lapdog," Chavous said. "Harold just defends the mayor even when the mayor doesn't ask for support. Frankly, it's more than frustrating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sewell |first1=Chan |last2=Leonnig |first2=Carol D. |title=Democrat Committee's Reformist Leader Under Fire |work=The Washington Post |date=April 12, 2001 |page=T2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chavous was vocal on a number of issues in his third council term. He opposed repeal of council members' term limits (approved by voters in 1994),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pierre |first1=Robert E. |last2=Chan |first2=Sewell |title=District Term Limits Tossed; Council Reverses Voters' Decision In Referendum |work=The Washington Post |date=June 6, 2001 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supported a [[redistricting]] plan which expanded Ward 7 west of the [[Anacostia River]] (angering residents of [[Kingman Park]], who wished to remain part of Ward 6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chan |first=Sewell |title=D.C.

Council Approves Pared-Down Budget |work=The Washington Post |date=October 2, 2002 |page=B4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and residents of Ward 7 were so upset with his failure to push for cleanup of abandoned lots that 20 of them dumped trash on Chavous' front lawn in January 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nakamura |first=David |title=Residents, City Try New Paths to Take Back Vacant Areas |work=The Washington Post |date=January 27, 2003 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chavous publicly stated he was considering another mayoral run in December 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leonnig |first=Carol D. |title=D.C. Mayor to Run for Second Term |work=The Washington Post |date=December 20, 2001 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Mayor Williams apologized publicly for ethical lapses in January 2002, local news media reported that this only boosted Chavous' interest in a campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Timberg |first=Craig |title=Williams's Mea Culpa Can't Quell Controversy |work=The Washington Post |date=January 13, 2002 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lingering anger among residents on the east side of the city at the closing of [[District of Columbia General Hospital|D.C. General Hospital]] and those who lived in areas unaffected by the city's business resurgence led Chavous to publicly announce he was considering a run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Timberg |first=Craig |title=Chavous Ponders Slings and Arrows of New Mayoral Bid |work=The Washington Post |date=January 17, 2002 |page=T2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2002, as the filing deadline neared, Chavous admitted he had a growing interest in challenging Williams for the mayor's office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Timberg |first=Craig |title=D.C. Mayor's Troubles Embolden Past Rivals |work=The Washington Post |date=April 24, 2002 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavous announced in May that he would make a decision by the end of the month, noting that his own poll showed he was "very well known and very well respected" and that the public held a much less negative view about him than Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Twomey |first=Steve |title=Mayor Has Critics But No Challenger For Nomination |work=The Washington Post |date=May 4, 2002 |page=B6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A damper was put on expectations for a Chavous run in late May when a ''Post'' poll showed Chavous losing to Williams, 51 percent to 31 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Timberg |first1=Craig |last2=Deane |first2=Claudia |title=Williams Losing Support Of Blacks |work=The Washington Post |date=May 26, 2002 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, Chavous announced he would not run for mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Timberg |first=Craig |title=Chavous to Pass On Race for Mayor |work=The Washington Post |date=June 7, 2002 |page=B5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a local court ruled that Williams had not submitted enough valid signatures to put himself on the ballot, Williams announced he would run as a write-in candidate in the Democratic Party primary. There was brief speculation by a number of political observers, ''The Washington Post'' said, that Chavous would enter the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Timberg |first=Craig |title=Williams Scrambles as Ballot Ruling Energizes Race |work=The Washington Post |date=July 28, 2002 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he did not.

The biggest issue of Chavous' third term was school vouchers.  Chavous had opposed vouchers in the past,&lt;ref name=strausspushvouchers&gt;{{cite news |last=Strauss |first=Valerie |title=President to Push Vouchers For D.C. |work=The Washington Post |date=February 8, 2003 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by February 2003, ''The Washington Post'' reported, Chavous was much more interested in providing ways to given parents a choice in whether to send their child to public school, private school, or charter school. Chavous and Mayor Williams met with [[United States Secretary of Education|Secretary of Education]] [[Rod Paige]] on February 6, 2003, to discuss vouchers and other "choice" programs, during which time Paige pledged a voucher program would not be forced on the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Metro: In Brief |work=The Washington Post |date=February 7, 2002 |page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the meeting, Chavous said he had not yet decided if he would support vouchers or not.&lt;ref name=strausspushvouchers /&gt; Chavous then began to significantly moderate his criticism of Williams.&lt;ref name=timbergwoodleelining&gt;{{cite news |last1=Timberg |first1=Craig |last2=Woodlee |first2=Yolanda |title=Nobody Seems to Be Lining Up to Support Williams's Budget |work=The Washington Post |date=March 20, 2003 |page=T2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 31, Chavous said that he had come to support vouchers, but only if the program were not forced on the city and only if federal (not city) funds were used to finance the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Meyer |first=Eugene |title=Cafritz Is Criticized For Voucher Support |work=The Washington Post |date=March 31, 2003 |page=B2 |postscript=none}}; {{cite news |last1=Timberg |first1=Craig |last2=Blum |first2=Justin |title=Mayor Endorses Vouchers in D.C. |work=The Washington Post |date=May 2, 2003 |page=A1 |postscript=none}}; {{cite news |last=Hsu |first=Spencer |title=Foes Halt Vote on School Vouchers |work=The Washington Post |date=July 18, 2003 |page=A1 |postscript=none}}; {{cite news |last=Milbank |first=Dana |title=From Iran, the 'Thomas Paine of School Choice' |work=The Washington Post |date=September 3, 2003 |page=A15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 8, 2003, President [[George W. Bush]] announced that he would seek federal legislation to impose a school voucher program on the city.&lt;ref name=strausspushvouchers /&gt; As Bush's proposal was considered by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], Chavous and D.C.'s [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|Delegate to Congress]], [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] (a strong opponent of vouchers), blamed one another for a series of snubs, missed meetings, and attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blum |first=Justin |title=Mayor Pursues Vouchers, Public School Aid |work=The Washington Post |date=July 24, 2003 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the measure moved to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in September, Chavous (along with Mayor Williams and Board President Cafritz) was opposed on the voucher issue by a significant majority of elected officials in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hsu |first=Spencer |title=Williams Touts Vouchers for D.C. Schools |work=The Washington Post |date=September 24, 2003 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate passed the school voucher bill on January 23, 2004, and President Bush signed it into law.  The legislation provided for a temporary, five-year experiment under which 1,700 low-income students would received up to $7,500 a year so that they could attend a private school in the city or nearby jurisdictions. Congress provided $14 million for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hsu |first1=Spencer |last2=Blum |first2=Justin |title=D.C. School Vouchers Win Final Approval |work=The Washington Post |date=January 23, 2004 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second major educational issue which arose during Chavous' third term was another round of reform aimed at the D.C. Board of Education. On September 24, 2003, Mayor Williams announced that the city's public school system was so dysfunctional and provided such low-quality education that he was introducing legislation to strip the Board of nearly all its power. Control over the school system would be given to the mayor, who would have the right to hire and fire the superintendent, principals, teachers, and other workers and who would gain significant new powers to reconstitute programs, operations, curriculum, and schools. Although Chavous was working on his own bill to give the Council and mayor more power over the school system,{{Efn|Chavous' plan was still under development, but would give the District Council a [[line item veto]] over the public school budget.&lt;ref name=timbergblumtakeover /&gt;}} he immediately threw his support behind Williams' plan.&lt;ref name=timbergblumtakeover&gt;{{cite news |last1=Timberg |first1=Craig |last2=Blum |first2=Justin |title=Williams Seeks School Takeover |work=The Washington Post |date=September 25, 2003 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But little action on the mayor's plan had been taken by January 2004. Chavous argued that Williams had not been forceful enough in making the case for his proposal, and journalist Craig Timberg linked Chavous' lack of activity on the measure to a reluctance to take on a controversial issue in an election year. (Chavous' own bill was also delayed, and he said it would not be ready until at least March 2004.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Timberg |first=Craig |title=Mayor's Move to Take Over Schools Drags |work=The Washington Post |date=January 4, 2004 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams said he might seek a third term as mayor merely to fight for his school reform bill, if the council did not act more expeditiously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Timberg |first=Craig |title=Williams Considers Trying for a 3rd Term |work=The Washington Post |date=January 8, 2004 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2004, Chavous announced he no longer supported the mayor's bill. The school district was without a superintendent, and Chavous argued that no individual would want the job if the council was considering such a significant change to the position. He also said that giving the mayor hiring and firing authority over the superintendent would require congressional approval or a voter referendum, and both processes would take too long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blum |first=Justin |title=Chavous Shifts View on Schools |work=The Washington Post |date=February 13, 2004 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavous then introduced a bill which largely undid the 2000 reforms. The new bill provided for a nine-member board, with eight elected members (one from each ward) and a president elected citywide. Chavous' committee approved the bill in April 2004 without a hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blum |first=Justin |title=Williams Rebuffed On School Takeover |work=The Washington Post |date=April 3, 2004 |page=B3 |postscript=none}}; {{cite news |last=Blum |first=Justin |title=Williams's School Plan Defeated |work=The Washington Post |date=April 21, 2004 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mayor Williams submitted an altered form of his original proposal two weeks after the defeat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blum |first=Justin |title=Williams Softening Schools Proposal |work=The Washington Post |date=April 25, 2004 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was rejected in mid-May and the Chavous bill approved by the council in July on a close 7-to-6 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blum |first=Justin |title=Mayor's School Takeover Defeated |work=The Washington Post |date=May 19, 2004 |page=B1 |postscript=none}}; {{cite news |last=Chan |first=Sewell |title=Hybrid School Board Retained |work=The Washington Post |date=July 14, 2004 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last major issue of Chavous' third term on the council was funding for [[Nationals Park]]. [[Major League Baseball]] was willing to move the [[Montreal Expos]] to Washington, D.C., which had long sought a major-league baseball franchise, but only if the city built a modern, baseball-only stadium for the team. By early June 2003, most of the District Council opposed the initial financing plan submitted by Williams.  Chavous was the lone undecided councilmember. (Harold Brazil was the only supporter.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Timberg |first1=Craig |last2=Fainaru |first2=Steve |title=Financing In Doubt For Stadium |work=The Washington Post |date=June 8, 2003 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavous supported the stadium plan only after he had lost the September 14 Democratic primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kovaleski |first1=Serge F. |last2=Woodlee |first2=Yolanda |title=Council Majority Backs Proposal—With Reservations |work=The Washington Post |date=September 30, 2004 |page=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he remained largely quiet during council debates, and was still considered a swing vote by November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nakamura |first=David |title=New Stadium Bill Adds Community Fund |work=The Washington Post |date=November 3, 2004 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 3, he provided the critical third vote on the council's Economic Development Committee, which approved the stadium deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nakamura |first=David |title=D.C.

His term in office ended on January 2, 2005, when Gray was sworn in.&lt;ref name=weissspread&gt;{{cite news |last=Weiss |first=Eric M. |title=Council's New Arrivals Push to Spread Revival |work=The Washington Post |date=January 3, 2005 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===
Chavous rejoined Arent Fox in March 2001 as counsel,&lt;ref name=sarasohnarent /&gt; a part-time position in which he specialized in business law, government relations, and general litigation.&lt;ref name=sewellblumappoint&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sewell |first1=Chan |last2=Blum |first2=Justin |title=Council Candidate Brazile?

Chavous also won an appointment as an adjunct faculty member at the [[Washington College of Law]] at [[American University]]. He taught education law during the spring 2001 term.&lt;ref name=sewellblumappoint /&gt;

In October 2017, Chavous was named [[K12 (company)|K12 inc.]]'s President of Academics, Policy and Schools.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/k12-inc-taps-school-choice-advocate-kevin-chavous-leadership-post/|title=K12 Inc.

==2004 failed reelection bid==
Rumors that Chavous would face significant primary opposition should he run for reelection in 2004 emerged in March 2003.  [[Vincent C. Gray]], former director of the D.C. Department of Human Services and the founding director of the D.C. chapter of [[Covenant House]], challenged incumbent Jeri Washington for the chairmanship of the Ward 7 Democrats. Gray easily won, 256 to 134. ''The Washington Post'' concluded that the loss reflected discontent with Chavous' tenure in office, and that there was widespread speculation that Gray would challenge Chavous for the Ward 7 council seat the following year.&lt;ref name=timbergwoodleelining /&gt; Several of the activists and donors who had backed Anthony Williams in his first race for mayor urged Gray to run against Chavous.&lt;ref name=nakamuranotion&gt;{{cite news |last=Nakamura |first=David |title=Chavous Challenges Notion That He's Lost Touch |work=The Washington Post |date=September 8, 2004 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray launched his campaign to unseat Chavous on May 19, 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Montgomery |first1=Lori |last2=Labbe |first2=Theola |title=Brazil Distances Himself From Mayor |work=The Washington Post |date=May 20, 2004 |page=T2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began waging what the ''Post'' called an "aggressive campaign".&lt;ref name=woodleeallenhas&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodlee |first=Yolanda |title=Allen Has $100,000 For Ward 8 Campaign |work=The Washington Post |date=August 11, 2004 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray was not Chavous' only challenger.  Five other individuals had also filed for the seat (although none of them were expected to impact the race significantly).&lt;ref name=woodleeallenhas /&gt;

By the end of June, Gray had raised $1,235 in contributions.&lt;ref name=woodleeallenhas /&gt; By the end of July, Chavous had raised $88,514&lt;ref name=woodleeallenhas /&gt; (all but $16,259 in May 2004)&lt;ref name=montgomerywoodleeincumbents&gt;{{cite news |last1=Montgomery |first1=Lori |last2=Woodlee |first2=Yolanda |title=For D.C. Council Incumbents, Major Challenges |work=The Washington Post |date=August 23, 2004 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had $42,295 on hand.&lt;ref name=woodleeallenhas /&gt; Gray's campaign theme was that Chavous was out of touch with the ward, rarely attending neighborhood events and traveling out of town too frequently. Sam Bost, president of the influential Far Northeast/Southeast Council, announced in mid August that he would no longer support Chavous, and Gray won endorsements from several key organizations and individuals. Chavous argued that working on legislation consumed most of his time, and pointed to the school voucher program and the extensive charter school network in the city as major accomplishments. By August 22, Gray had raised $38,531 for a total of $52,389,&lt;ref name=montgomerywoodleeincumbents /&gt; while Chavous had raised $110,199 (and had $42,296 on hand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodlee |first=Yolanda |title=Barry Filing Incomplete |work=The Washington Post |date=August 26, 2004 |page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chavous campaign received a blow on August 31 when the D.C. Democratic State Committee voted 35-to-3 to endorse Gray in the Ward 7 Democratic primary race. The vote, which ''The Washington Post'' called "an embarrassment" for Chavous, was the first time committee had endorsed a candidate in a primary election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Montgomery |first1=Lori |last2=Woodlee |first2=Yolanda |title=Party Committee Rejects Chavous, Backs Ward 7 Challenger |work=The Washington Post |date=September 1, 2004 |page=B4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavous dismissed the outcome, calling the vote "a sham".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nakamura |first=David |title=Chavous Unfazed Party's Rebuff |work=The Washington Post |date=September 2, 2004 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the primary approached on September 14, the ''Post'' called the election the closest since Chavous defeated Crawford in 1992. Voter sentiment seemed to focus on the 2003–2004 Board of Education reform debate, with voters blaming Chavous for the long debate—which, many said, discouraged the two leading candidates for superintendent to drop out. Gray also hammered Chavous on his support for the federal voucher program, which he claimed took money away from public schools.&lt;ref name=nakamuranotion /&gt; Chavous argued that he had helped improve the delivery and amount of city services, was critical in winning construction of two new public schools in Ward 7, and that he had brought economic development to the area by shepherding the redevelopment of the Skyland shopping mall.&lt;ref name=montgomerywoodlee&gt;{{cite news |last1=Montgomery |first1=Lori |last2=Woodlee |first2=Yolanda |title=Barry In, 3 D.C. Council Incumbents Out |work=The Washington Post |date=September 15, 2004 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the primary, Chavous had raised $138,849 in contributions.&lt;ref name=woodleestraussmissed&gt;{{cite news |last1=Woodlee |first1=Yolanda |last2=Strauss |first2=Valerie |title=Chavous Camp Missed Filings, Wrote Checks Without Funds |work=The Washington Post |date=December 10, 2004 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chavous lost his bid for reelection after losing the September 14, 2004, Democratic primary to Gray, 50 percent to 34 percent.&lt;ref name=montgomerywoodlee /&gt; David Nakamura, reporter for ''The Washington Post'', said that voters were unhappy with city schools, which had not improved despite the reforms Chavous took credit for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nakamura |first=David |title=East of the Anacostia, Anger Is Power |work=The Washington Post |date=September 15, 2004 |page=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The D.C. Office of Campaign Finance began an investigation into the 2004 Chavous Democratic primary campaign. ''The Washington Post'' reported that the Chavous campaign failed to file financial reports for October and November and paid three invoices totaling $9,000 when the campaign did not have [[Non-sufficient funds|funds to cover the checks]]. A creditor then filed a complaint with the D.C. police. The Office of Campaign Finance scheduled a hearing on the alleged campaign violations in November 2004, but Chavous did not appear. In an interview with the ''Post'', Chavous blamed a bank error and his campaign treasurer for the problems. Chavous personally gave one creditor a $5,000 [[cashier's check]] to cover a radio ad purchase, and his campaign's field coordinator was paid using $2,000 of Chavous' personal funds and $1,000 of the campaign's funds.&lt;ref name=woodleestraussmissed /&gt;

In [[Politics of Austria|Austrian politics]], the '''Ministry of Education''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Bildungsministerium'', historically also ''Unterrichtsminiterium'') is the [[ministry (government)|ministry]] in charge of schools, universities, and arts policy. 

The current head of the Ministry is  [[Heinz Faßmann]]. &lt;ref name="neu"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kurier.at/politik/inland/tuerkis-blau-i-das-sind-die-neuen-minister/302.322.267 | title = Türkis-Blau: Das sind die neuen Minister | date = December 16, 2017 | publisher = Kurier | accessdate = 2018-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orf"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://orf.at/stories/2419283/2419284/ | title = 16-köpfiges ÖVP-FPÖ-Team vereidigt | date = December 16, 2017 | publisher = ORF | accessdate = 2018-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry was first created in 1848 as the Ministry of Public Schools (''Ministerium für öffentlichen Unterricht''). As of 2018, the agency's official name is '''Ministry of Education, Science and Research''' (''Bundesministerium für Bildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung'' or ''BMBWF''). &lt;ref name="bmgnov"&gt;{{cite web | title = Bundesministeriengesetz-Novelle 2017; BGBl. I Nr. 164/2017 | url = https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/eli/bgbl/I/2017/164/20171228 | language = German | date = December 28, 2017 | accessdate = 2018-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- note this is the date of promulgation, not of adoption --&gt;

==Responsibilities==
The Ministry is responsible for all matters regarding public education, including [[Education in Austria#General Education|general education]], [[vocational education|vocational preparatory schools]], [[Adult education]], [[educational research]] and the [[School of education|Pedagogical Universities]].

==History==
The Ministry was first founded in 1848 in the wake of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|Bourgeois revolution]]. Back then, it was named "Ministry for Cultus and Education" and included religious affairs. In the first years of the [[First Austrian Republic]] it was merged into the "Ministry for Interior and Education", until it became its own authority again in 1923. Chancellor [[Bruno Kreisky]] restructured it in 1971, creating the [[Federal Minister of Science, Research and Economy|Ministry of Science and Research]] on one hand and the "Ministry of Education and Arts" on the other. From 2000 to 2007, they were merged again and formed a "Ministry of Education, Science and Culture".

In 2007, the Science Ministry was again established as its own authority. This left the remaining parts as "Ministry for Education, Arts and Culture" ([[German language|German]]: ''Bundesministerium für Unterricht, Kunst und Kultur'', short: ''BMUKK'' or ''Unterrichtsministerium''). It then had additional responsibilities in the fields of Religious foundations and the arts, such as theatre and Film promotion, Museums and related management and funding, such as for the [[Austrian National Library]], and the [[Vienna Philharmonic]]. The [[Bundesdenkmalamt]] was a sub department of the BMUKK as well.

Balbo graduated from [[Brentwood High School (Brentwood, New York)|Brentwood High School]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ned.balbo|title=Ned Balbo|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] at [[Vassar College]] in 1981, his [[Master of Arts]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1986, and his [[Master of Fine Arts]] at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=pq2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catalogue.loyola.edu/catalogues/current/archive/grc9900.pdf Graduate Programs]. Loyola College in Maryland&lt;/ref&gt;

Balbo taught poetry and prose at [[Loyola University Maryland]] from 1990 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cheausa.org/poet-versus-party-line-dismissal-ned-balbo/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125135438/http://cheausa.org/poet-versus-party-line-dismissal-ned-balbo/# |archive-date=2015-01-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a visiting faculty member in the MFA program in Creative Writing and Environment at [[Iowa State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wcupa.edu/arts-humanities/poetry/documents/Poet_Bios.pdf |title=Bio |website=www.wcupa.edu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married to poet-essayist [[Jane Satterfield]].&lt;ref name=pq2010/&gt;

==Poetry and style==
According to Lisa Vihos in ''Verse Wisconsin'', "Balbo...gives shape and heft to the formless, fleeting past {{mdash}} both historical and personal {{mdash}} through his rich language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.versewisconsin.org/Issue103/reviews103/balbo_vihos.html|title=Verse Wisconsin 103-Balbo Review|website=www.versewisconsin.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing ''The Trials of Edgar Poe and Other Poems'' for ''JMWW'', Patricia Valdata observes that Balbo's work "raises difficult questions about home, about the relationship of parent to child, about a society's responsibility to its poor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmww.150m.com/Balborev2.html|title=Free Web Hosting, Free Website Builder, Make a Website|website=www.jmww.150m.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''Studio'', Lucas Jacob notes that in ''The Trials of Edgar Poe and Other Poems'', "Balbo...reminds us of the grace we find in our time with each other on this 'island' of life on Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studiojournal.ca/vol-5-1-2011/reviews/jacob/index.html|title=STUDIO Volume 5 Number 1, 2011 - Review|website=studiojournal.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lesley Wheeler]], writing on-line in [[Kenyon Review]], asserts that "Balbo’s complicated sense of place and his poetic resourcefulness make [''Upcycling Paumanok''] worth your time, but what impresses me most are the extended narrative lyrics, the first of which appears several pages in. Balbo’s deftness at balancing story and music is often breathtaking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kenyonreview.org/reviews/micro-reviews-nov-2016/|title=November Micro-Reviews - The Kenyon Review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balbo has written in a variety of [[New Formalism|forms]], including [[blank verse]], sonnets, villanelles, sestinas, and nonce forms, as well as [[free verse]].&lt;ref name=pq2010/&gt; His poetic influences include Ai, Elizabeth Bishop, Louise Bogan, Robert Frost, Randall Jarrell, Denis Johnson, Weldon Kees, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ned-Balbo/265838986763467?sk=info|title=Ned Balbo: poet, translator, essayist|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to book awards, Balbo received a 2017 [[National Endowment for the Arts]] Literature in Translation Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/FY17-NEA-Literature-Translation-Fellowship-Recipients.pdf |title=Fellowship recipients |website=www.arts.gov |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the recipient of three Maryland Arts Council Individual Artist Awards in poetry and the Robert Frost Foundation Poetry Award.&lt;ref name=pq2010&gt;Lori A.

According to News Diary online, the New Deal Organization aims to change the mindset of young people and encourage morality.&lt;ref name="newsdiaryonline1"/&gt;  The New Deal combats violence, drug abuse and other societal vices by addressing parents and children and encouraging a synergy to foster beneficial relationships on the basis that good behavior starts in the home.&lt;ref name="allafrica1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Daily Trust (Abuja) |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201404080592.html |title=Nigeria: New Group Emerges to Tackle Youth Indiscipline |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=2014-04-08 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/daniel-kanu-and-crimes-prevention-among-the-youths/177022/&lt;/ref&gt; To enforce this, the New Deal utilizes a two part plan, called Y.A.C.T. and P.A.C.T., respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gongnews.net/nigeria-needs-a-new-revolution-to-escape-its-current-crisis-daniel-kanu/ |title=Nigeria needs a new revolution to escape its current crisis – Daniel Kanu |publisher=Gongnews |date=2014-05-25 |accessdate=2015-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924022958/http://www.gongnews.net/nigeria-needs-a-new-revolution-to-escape-its-current-crisis-daniel-kanu/ |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== P.A.C.T. ==

P.A.C.T. (Parents Against Crime Together) is one of two parts of the New Deal, and calls for parents to bring back family moral values.

== Y.A.C.T. ==

Y.A.C.T. (Youths against Crime Together) is the second part of the New Deal, and encourages youth to embrace societal, communal and ethical values. As part of Y.A.C.T., the New deal admonishes children to make a social contract and recommitment to their parents.&lt;ref name="allafrica1"/&gt;

The '''Oklahoma Energy Resources Board''' (abbreviated '''OERB''') is an [[government agency|agency]] of the state of [[Oklahoma]]. Funded voluntarily by Oklahoma's [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] producers and royalty owners, OERB conducts [[environmental restoration]] of orphaned and abandoned well sites, encourages the wise and efficient use of energy, and  promotes energy education.&lt;ref&gt;http://oerb.com/about/funding.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board is composed of 21 members. 7 members are appointed by the [[Governor of Oklahoma]], 7 are appointed by the [[President pro tempore of the Oklahoma Senate]], and 7 appointed by the [[Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives]]. All members are either independent oil or natural gas producers or representatives of major oil companies that do business in Oklahoma. The Board, in turn, appoints an Executive Director to serve as the [[chief administrative officer]] of the Board.

The current board chairman is David House, president of Jireh Resources, LLC in Tulsa, OK.

OERB was created by the [[Oklahoma]] Legislature and energy industry leaders in 1993 during the term of [[Governor of Oklahoma]] [[David Walters]].

==Mission==
The stated missions of the Oklahoma Energy Resources Board are:
*to educate Oklahomans about the importance of petroleum (oil and natural gas) in their lives through traditional and non-traditional school curricula, advertising, and public relations
*to environmentally restore abandoned well sites to productive land use
*to promote environmentally sound production methods and technologies
*to research and provide educational activities concerning the petroleum exploration and production industry

==Leadership==
OERB is under the leadership of the [[Oklahoma State Cabinet|Secretary of Energy]], the Chair of the Board, and the Executive Director of OERB. Under [[Governor of Oklahoma]] [[Mary Fallin]],  C. Michael Ming serves as Secretary, David House serves as the Chairman and Mindy Stitt serves as the Executive Director.

==Environmental restoration==
Since its creation in 1993, the OERB has committed $69 million to restore more than 11,800 abandoned and orphaned well sites as part of its [[environmental restoration]] program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oerb.com/restoration/environ-index.asp Well Site Cleanup&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It has made restoration progress in 67 of Oklahoma's 77 counties and has a restoration budget of $6 million for the current {{when|date=June 2012}} [[fiscal year]].

Unique is OERB's funding process &amp;ndash; though it is funded by a 0.1% assessment on oil and gas sales (not uncommon among similar agencies), it is a '''''voluntary''''' assessment.  Any producer or royalty owner may opt out of the program by requesting OERB (between January 1 and March 31 of each year) for a refund of previously paid assessments.  OERB states that over 95% of participants remain in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oerb.com/Default.aspx?tabid=146|title=OERB|publisher=|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Throughout its history, the OERB has reached more than 1 million Oklahoma students with energy curricula, classroom supplies, field trips, college scholarships and presentations. OERB reaches all academic grade levels – from kindergarten through college with its energy education programs, including:&lt;ref&gt;http://oerb.com/education/student.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

*The '''OERB Petroleum Scholar Program''' distributes up to $500,000 each year to Oklahoma college students majoring in petroleum-related fields. The deadline for these scholarships is March 1, 2012 and applications can be found at the official. [http://oerb.com/education/student-scholarships.asp OERB Petroleum Scholar] page.
*The '''PetroTech Program''' provides training and certification for Oklahomans interested in Geo Tech, Land Tech and Engineering Tech positions within the oil and natural gas industry. Detailed information about the programs can be found at the official [http://www.oerb.com/Default.aspx?tabid=108 Petro Tech page.] The Oklahoma Energy Resources Board created the PetroTech Program to help prepare Oklahomans for careers in the energy industry. A year after its inauguration, the program had accepted more than 400 students and industry employers are now hiring PetroTech graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kosu/news.newsmain?action=article&amp;ARTICLE_ID=1213057&amp;sectionID=1|title=Find Stations and Donate : NPR|publisher=|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*'''Petro Pros''' gives oil and natural gas professionals an opportunity to volunteer their time to visit classrooms and show children the science and business side of the industry.
*'''Little Bits''' is a kindergarten through second grade energy curriculum that introduces simple energy terms through games and reading. More than 1,200 teachers have been trained to teach this curriculum.
*'''Fossils to Fuel''' is an elementary school energy curriculum with nearly 7,000 teachers trained.
*'''Petro Active''' is a middle school energy curriculum with more than 1,600 teachers trained.
*'''Core Energy''' is a high school energy curriculum with more than 2,600 teachers trained.
*'''Museum Partnerships''' allow the OERB to partner with several museums across the state to enhance energy education curricula and provide free classroom field trips.
*The OERB uses '''Safety Videos''' to demonstrate the dangers of playing around well sites. The video entitled, "What's the risk" can be found at OERB's [http://oerb.com/education/student-safety.asp safety page]
*'''Well Site Safety Day''' is an annual event at the State Capitol to spread awareness of well site dangers to children, parents and teachers.

==Conservation==
Through its '''Conservation Education Program''', the OERB has contributed $1.75 million to help more than 800 Oklahoma families weatherize their homes and save up to 30 percent on their utility bills. In addition to providing weatherization assistance, the OERB provides tips on saving energy and money through advertisements, community events and a [http://oerb.com/conservation/conservation-index.asp website], which includes a “Weatherize Your Home” video demonstration, conservation tips and information on how to apply for home heating assistance.

'''Pacific Open Learning Health Net''' ('''POLHN''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|l|h|ən}}) is a non-profit established in 2003, focused on [[distance education]]  for health professionals working in the Pacific. Since 2004, it has provided free online courses for [[continuing professional development]] in a wide range of health and science related disciplines.  These include self-directed, [[blended learning]], instructor-led and hybrid courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courses.polhncourses.org/oldmoodle|title=Former Courses|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courses.polhncourses.org/newmoodle|title=New Courses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform runs on a [[free and open-source software]] [[learning management system]]. POLHN works with several universities institutions and Ministries of Health to develop online health related courses guided by [[WHO]] publications and accepted [[standard operating procedure]].  Since 2013, the platform has resembled a typical [[massive open online course]] (MOOC) platform.

==History==

The [[World Health Organization]] ([[WHO]]) and Pacific Ministries of Health established POLHN in 2003 through funding provided by the Government of [[Japan]]. POLHN was established to address the need of [[health professionals]] in the Pacific to access [[continuing professional development]] (CPD) opportunities and up-to-date [[health information]]. POLHN fulfills these needs through an [[e-learning]] network across fourteen [[Pacific Island]] Countries, areas and territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/southpacific/programmes/pacific_initiatives/polhn/en|title=Overview|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

POLHN provides access to sponsored and self-paced courses, news, application forms, and links to resources. The website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polhn.org|title=POLHN Website|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the main gateway to accessing courses, online resources, and health information. The website also contains information about POLHN,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polhn.org/about-polhn|title=POLHN website - about POLHN|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt; information on learning centres,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polhn.org/learning-centres|title=POLHN website - Learning Centres}}&lt;/ref&gt; contact details for POLHN country coordinators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polhn.org/team-profiles|title=POLHN website - Meet the Team|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt; information on the availability of scholarships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polhn.org/scholarships|title=POLHN website-scholarships|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt; and application forms for courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polhn.org/forms|title=POLHN website-forms|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has partnerships with many organisations, allowing members to complete certification programs.  There are also general courses unrelated to any certification program, such as Patient Safety,  Risk Communications,  Diabetes, and Psycho-social Response in Humanitarian Disasters.  These take between 20 and 60 hours to complete, with automatic assessment of activities and exams.

Since its inception, POLHN has undergone various steps to expand and improve. These have included external reviews, for instance by the [[WHO Collaborating Centres|WHO Collaborating Centre]] at the [[University of Technology Sydney]] and Hezel Associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hezel.com/what-we-ve-done/past-projects/226-who-wpro-pohln-nursing|title=Hezel Associates - WHO-WPRO Evaluation of POHLN Nursing Education (2010-2011)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goals===

POLHN has three main goals: 
# To provide access to quality, equitable, efficient and effective e-learning platforms that support health workers to maintain relevant skills and in so doing to enable countries to have a more sustainable and responsive skill mix;
# To assist regulatory and ministerial bodies to develop relevant policies for continuing professional development (CPD) of health workforces; and
# To support in building and sustaining the capacity of institutions to provide appropriate and accredited curricula through collaborative partnerships with health professionals, service providers, professional bodies, healthcare organisations, education and research entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polhn.org/about-polhn|title=POLHN website - About us|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this, POLHN has a popular newsletter, which is sent out regularly to students and staff regarding all the current events related to POLHN, such as scholarship opportunities, new blog articles, and the latest courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polhn.org/subscribe|title=POLHN website - subscribe to our newsletter|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blog also offers the opportunity for members of the POLHN community to write their own articles and post comments.

== Partnership approach ==

POLHN is a partnership between [[WHO]] and Pacific Ministries of Health. POLHN works with regional academic institutions; course providers; academic institutions and development partners to develops and provides continuing education opportunities to health professionals in the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iris.wpro.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665.1/11817/WPR_2015_DPS_001_eng.pdf/|title=POLHN Handbook|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt; POLHN hosts different course categories:
* Self-paced;

POLHN's self-paced courses are also put together with the assistance of its partners. Some courses are created in-house at the WHO Secretariat in Suva, Fiji. Others are made in cooperation with partner institutions, including the [[University of Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the [[University of Queensland]] produced the self-paced course entitled "Health Information Management", found here: https://polhn.org/courses/health-information-management&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of partners==

===University of Fiji===
POLHN sponsors registered nurses in the Pacific to undertake a Bachelor of Nursing Bridging programme at the [[University of Fiji]] (also known as UniFiji). This allows nurses with a Diploma in Nursing to upgrade their qualification to a bachelor's degree. This new initiative has been widely praised in the media in Fiji, where POLHN sponsorship for nursing at UniFiji is seen as a real opportunity to take the skills of nurses in the Pacific to a whole new level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fijisun.com.fj/2018/01/28/unifiji-offers-bachelor-of-nursing-course/|newspaper=Fiji Sun|title=UniFiji Offers Bachelor Of Nursing Course}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The origins of the company can be traced back to [[William Pickering (publisher)|William Pickering]] (1796–1854) who set up as an antiquarian bookseller and publisher in 1820. After William Pickering’s death, the business was carried on by his son, Basil Montagu Pickering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22213 |title=Pickering, William (1796–1854) |publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 |date=|accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his death, in 1878, it was purchased by Andrew Chatto (1841–1913), one of the founding partners of [[Chatto and Windus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/chatto-windus

&lt;/ref&gt; By the early twentieth century Pickering &amp; Chatto was solely concerned with antiquarian book selling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/47445 |title=Chatto, Andrew (1840–1913) |publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2009 |date= |accessdate=2014-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/world/europe/william-rees-mogg-former-editor-of-the-times-of-london-dies-at-84.html?_r=0 |title=William Rees-Mogg, Ex-Editor of The Times of London, Dies at 84 |publisher =nytimes.com |date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord [[William Rees-Mogg]] bought Pickering &amp; Chatto in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/29/william-rees-mogg-obituary |title=Lord Rees-Mogg obituary |publisher=Guardian.co.uk |date=2012-12-29 |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/9771814/Lord-Rees-Mogg.html |title=Lord Rees-Mogg |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date=2012-12-30 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 he re-established Pickering &amp; Chatto (Publishers) Limited as an independent publishing house, serving as chairman and proprietor.&lt;ref name=engass&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=William|last2=Lucas|first2=Helen|last3=Treharne|first3=Elaine|title=The English Association: One Hundred Years on|date=30 December 2006|publisher=[[English Association]]|location=[[Leicester]]|isbn=9780900232251|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wvMvAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9770732/William-Rees-Mogg.html |title=William Rees-Mogg |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date=2010-12-29 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the antiquarian bookselling business became an entirely separate enterprise and there is now no connection between the two companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pickering-chatto.com/PC/Home.html

[[File:Practical Education 1798.jpg|thumb|right|Title page from the first edition]]
'''''Practical Education''''' is an educational treatise written by Maria Edgeworth and her father Richard Lovell Edgeworth. Published in 1798, it is a comprehensive theory of education that combines the ideas of philosophers [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as well as of educational writers such as [[Thomas Day]], [[William Godwin]], [[Joseph Priestley]], and [[Catharine Macaulay]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The Edgeworths' theory of education was based on the premise that a child's early experiences are formative and that the associations they form early in life are long-lasting. They also encourage hands-on learning and include suggestions of "experiments" that children can perform and learn fun.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Locke's emphasis on the importance of concrete language over abstract, the Edgeworth's argued that words should clearly indicate "distinct ideas". This contributed to what Romanticist Alan Richardson calls "their controversial positions", including their resistance to reading [[fairy tale]]s to children or discussing religion with them.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Restore Our Alienated Rights''' ('''ROAR''') was an organization formed in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] by [[Louise Day Hicks]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/Guide%20to%20the%20Louise%20Day%20Hicks%20papers_tcm3-37481.pdf Guide to the Louise Day Hicks records]&lt;/ref&gt; Opposed to [[desegregation busing]] of Boston's public school students, the group protested the federally-mandated order to integrate Boston Public Schools by staging formal, sometimes violent protests. It remained active from 1974 until 1976.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title=’Militant Mothers’: Boston, Busing, and the Bicentennial of 1976.” Historical Journal of Massachusetts|last1=Nutter|first1=Kathleen|date=2010|work=Historical Journal of Massachusetts|publisher=Boston Globe|volume=38 Àissue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background Information ==
Many citizens felt the racial imbalance in Boston needed to be improved. The African-Americans of Boston had been fighting for equality in black and white public schools for decades before the creation of the Racial Imbalance Act or the formation of ROAR. Due to the inherent segregation within Boston, many schools were composed of either majority white or majority black students. This led to the white schools receiving more funding per student and having newer educational resources while black schools were receiving statistically much less funding and were typically of inferior quality than schools in primarily white districts. There was apparent segregation which occurred by chance legally. This form of segregation, known as "de facto" segregation was not intentional. Rather, it occurred by circumstance.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bosdesca.omeka.net/background|title=Background · Stark &amp; Subtle Divisions: A Collaborative History of Segregation in Boston|website=bosdesca.omeka.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the members of the Boston School Committee, [[Louise Day Hicks]], was to become the founder of ROAR. The committee itself denied any accusations of inequity amongst white and black students. Hicks spoke outwardly against the desegregation of schools. The [[NAACP]] was not willing to let this segregation continue and filed a lawsuit against the Boston School Committee; this was the beginning of the [[Morgan v. Hennigan|Tallulah Morgan v. James Hennigan]] case which would eventually bring about forced busing. On June 21, 1974, [[Wendell Arthur Garrity Jr.|Judge Garrity]] ruled that the Committee was to create a plan to desegregate their schools. When the committee failed to provide such an idea, the federal court became involved. By federal decision, students were to be bused to schools in different districts to decrease the level of inequal education students were receiving.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Those who opposed the forced busing, which happened to be the majority of whites, especially mothers, in Boston, retaliated with protests. They eventually organized to create the infamous ROAR. While some of their concerns were legitimate, the organization was ultimately pro-segregation of schools. Not all members were definitive racists, but there was a connection between the group and racism as some of the members spoke outwardly against blacks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Initially a small group of females, they quickly gained local popularity as many locals shared their opinions. The act of forced busing was seen as a populist movement that potentially threatened the traditional values that the women of ROAR held.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The fusing of mainly African-American and white districts could dissipate the borders between two very different neighborhoods that held different values, leading to certain groups feeling alienated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Czw8VQnuGwC&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Groundwork: Local Black Freedom Movements in America|last=Theoharis|first=Jeanne|last2=Woodard|first2=Komozi|date=2005|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814782859|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==

[[Louise Day Hicks|Louise Day-Hicks]] created "Save Boston Committee" in February 1974 with an agenda to restore "the custodial rights of parents over their children".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bosdesca.omeka.net/exhibits/show/roar-anti-busing-group|title=ROAR: The Anti-Busing group with the Loudest Voice · Stark &amp; Subtle Divisions: A Collaborative History of Segregation in Boston|website=bosdesca.omeka.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believed it was unfair for the government to force all public schools to desegregate, claiming it was neither a viable nor a beneficial way to improve American society and education. The group was later renamed ROAR to oppose the Racial Imbalance Act in 1974. The busing change in their eyes was "a total disaster".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2006/09/12/elvira_pixie_palladino_74_fierce_foe_of_imposed_busing/|title=Elvira 'Pixie' Palladino, 74, fierce foe of imposed busing - The Boston Globe|website=archive.boston.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hicks changed the name by the summer to ROAR. She used her position as a mother to rally others into her cause, arguing that the government needed to take a different approach if they wanted a stable nation. Some Americans, namely white mothers believed they were righteous in their cause and that they just wanted to keep the school environment running properly as much as possible.

==Purpose==
The group's purpose was to fight off U.S. Federal Judge W. Arthur Garrity's [[court order]] requiring the city of Boston to implement desegregation busing — an order intended to eliminate ''[[de facto]]'' [[racial segregation]] in its [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. To supporters, ROAR's purpose was its namesake; i.e., to protect the "vanishing rights" of white citizens. To its many opponents, however, ROAR was a symbol of mass [[racism]] coalesced into a single organization. ROAR was composed primarily of women, and its leaders argued that "the issue of forced busing is a women's issue."&lt;ref name="Banks Nutter 2010 Militant Mothers"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Banks Nutter|first=Kathleen|date=Fall 2010|title=“Militant Mothers”: Boston, Busing, and the Bicentennial of 1976|url=http://www.wsc.mass.edu/mhj/pdfs/militant%20mothers.pdf|journal=Historical Journal of Massachusetts|volume=38 |issue=1|pages=52–75|access-date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 1974, the committee organized a 20,000 person march from Boston City Hall Plaza to the State House.&lt;ref name="Banks Nutter 2010 Militant Mothers"/&gt; On March 19, 1975, 1,200 ROAR members marched in Washington DC to generate national support for their cause.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morgan |first=Marilyn |date=March 18, 2017 |title=Roaring for Rights: Louise Day Hicks, Women &amp; the Anti-Busing Movement |url=http://www.archivespublichistory.org/?tag=restore-our-alienated-rights |journal=Archives &amp; Public History at UMass Boston |access-date=April 6, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palladino was considered to be more radical than Hicks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In January 1975, Palladino and eighty ROAR women stormed into a governor's commission on the status of women, dressed in "Stop Forced Busing" T-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/20060913/news/309139969|title=Pixie Palladino, opponent of school desegregation|last=Press|first=The Associated|work=southcoasttoday.com|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 10, 1976, Palladino began to create her own group, "United ROAR", which catered to beliefs that were more moderate than those of Hicks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Fran Johnnene was one of ROAR's most influential members. Johnnene was mostly responsible for holding meetings at her house in Hyde Park, rounding up neighbors and community members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sparechangenews.net/2016/03/raymond-flynn/|title=Raymond Flynn: The South Boston insider who struggled to keep his alma mater open and ascended to political prominence - Spare Change News|website=sparechangenews.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnnene was also involved with the less radical anti-busing group, the Massachusetts Citizens Against Forced Busing, in February 1974. Towards the end of 1975, Johnnene left ROAR due to the increased radicalism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A majority of the group's members were white Boston housewives, known as "militant mothers."&lt;ref name="Banks Nutter 2010 Militant Mothers" /&gt;

== Activities ==
There were instances of both violent and peaceful protest from the organization ROAR. During a protest, a wooden bus was burned as a representation of the forced busing policy (Powell). There were also occasions on which school children and parents alike pelted the buses coming from predominantly African-American areas (Gellerman). Protester signs often displayed racial slurs such as, 'Nigger Go Home,' and depicted monkeys (Gellerman). On December 11, 1974, at South Boston High, Michael Faith, a white student was stabbed by a black student by the name of James White. Hicks, present at the scene, attempted to calm the crowd, most of which belonging in ROAR. At that time, she prioritized the black students' safety on their way back home.

However, members also protested in peaceful ways. For example, in the time immediately following the desegregation, majority of white children did not attend school in both the formerly African-American schools and historically white schools (Gellerman). They reenacted the Boston Massacre to symbolize their empathy with the oppressed inhabitants of colonial America (Lukas). On April 3, 1974, over 20,000 ROAR protesters marched on the State House to show their distaste for desegregation busing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On March 19, 1975, 1,200 members of ROAR marched on Washington DC to gain national recognition for their cause and possibly an amendment placed into the constitution that would illegal desegregation busing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Societal Response ==
By the year 1975, ROAR shifts its focus from busing to feminine issues, including participating in the signing for the year 1975 to be known as "International Women's Year." At that point, the forced busing act was seen more as an attack on women, specifically mothers. ROAR however remained ignored by the government, but continued to protest fervently. Though the media particularly the Boston Globe, often portrayed the group as racist, ROAR leader Virginia Sheehy states that their issues are mainly class-based. Sheehy argued by stating that she initially worked alongside black women in the Home and School Association prior to the forced busing issue. On the other hand, [[The Real Paper]], a local newspaper company stated that the ROAR group is truly fighting for their traditional values. Overall, ROAR helped  to consolidate the conservatism movement in the following year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''San Felipe Cooperative School''' is a K-12 private school in [[Lima]], [[Peru]].  It is located at 985 Avenida Gregorio Escobedo in the city district of [[Jesús María District, Lima|Jesús María]], and within the limits of [[Residencial San Felipe, Lima|San Felipe]] residential complex.

==History==
The school was established in 1967 as [[Jesuit]] Catholic school under the religious congregation of the [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate]].  In 1969, during the military government of Gen. [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], the religious order withdrew from the school.  The parents' association then established a cooperative to run the school.  This cooperative received official recognition via Government Resolution N° 007-74-DAE ORAMI IV of February 28, 1974.  On July 21, 1989 under government resolution N° 1568-USE13 the school was recognized as “Centro Educativo de Gestion Cooperativa San Felipe".&lt;ref name="San Felipe School website"&gt;[http://www.colegiosanfelipe.edu.pe/principal.php Colegio San Felipe website]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In the 1980s and 1990s, San Felipe School was well known throughout Lima, attracting students from well beyond the San Felipe area.  It's being run by a parents' cooperative made it an attractive option for some on philosophical grounds.

Based on the academic performance of its graduates, San Felipe is ranked among the best schools in Peru by the respected [[Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú]] (PUCP).  As a result, San Felipe has consistently earned a spot on the list of schools whose top students seeking admission to the PUCP are exempted from the university's entrance examination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pucp.edu.pe/content/pagina9.php?pID=216&amp;pIDSeccionWeb=22&amp;pIDContenedor=346&amp;pIDIdiomaLocal=1&amp;pIDReferencial= "ITS (Ingreso directo de alumnos destacados de colegios seleccionados) - Colegios Seleccionados"] in [http://www.pucp.edu.pe Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú webpage] (Entry retrieved 29 January 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pucp.edu.pe/pregrado/postulantes/admision/modalidades-de-admision/its/colegios-seleccionados/ "ITS (Ingreso directo de alumnos destacados de colegios seleccionados) - Colegios Seleccionados - Estudio 2013"] in [http://www.pucp.edu.pe Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú webpage] (Entry retrieved 28 August 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ponticifia Universidad Católica del Perú, [https://www.scribd.com/document/341796327/Colegios-ITS-PUCP-2017-Excelencia-Academica#from_embed ''Reconocimiento a la Excelencia Academica - Colegios ITS PUCP - Admisión 2017''], Lima, May 2016. (Entry retrieved 13 March 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==School facilities==
The school has a {{convert|58000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility, which in addition to classrooms, includes a paved yard with two mini-soccer pitches, one basketball court, and one volleyball court.

'''Suki Schorer''' is an American ballet dancer, ballet mistress, teacher, and writer.
She danced with [[George Balanchine]]'s New York City Ballet from 1959 to 1972.
Suki Schorer teaches at the [[School of American Ballet]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sab.org/school/faculty.php?fid=10 Suki Schorer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127164157/http://sab.org/school/faculty.php?fid=10 |date=November 27, 2010 }}. Sab.org. Retrieved on 2013-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt; the official school of the [[New York City Ballet]] and is a [[Balanchine Trust]] répétiteur.

==Biography==
Suki Schorer received her early professional training at the San Francisco Ballet School and joined the San Francisco Ballet in 1956. She continued her ballet studies with Lew Christensen as a member of the Company and also attended the University of California at Berkeley. In 1959, at the invitation of George Balanchine, she joined the New York City Ballet where she took his daily classes for over a decade. In 1968, she was made a principal dancer. Her repertory included principal roles in ''Apollo'', ''Serenade'', ''Concerto Barocco'', ''Symphony in C'', ''Ivesiana'', ''Stars and Stripes'', ''Tarantella'' and ''Jewels'' among others. Balanchine made solo roles on her in ''Don Quixote'', ''Raymonda Variations'', ''Harlequinade'', and ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.

Almost from the beginning of her tenure at the New York City Ballet, she began to teach at the School of American Ballet and she occasionally taught company class. Later, Mr. B asked her to teach a "newcomers" class for dancers joining the company. At his request, she toured the US as a talent scout for the School of American Ballet and assisted him in seminars for ballet teachers that were organized with support from the Ford Foundation.

On her retirement from the Company in 1972, Mr. B organized a new class of advanced girls at SAB of which she was to be the principal teacher. In 1998, she was appointed to the Brown Foundation Senior Faculty Chair at the School, which remains her principal commitment. In addition to teaching, she has staged a ballet annually for SAB's Workshop and excerpts for appearances in other venues by SAB students.

[[:fr:Suki Schorer|Suki Schorer]] lectures on Balanchine aesthetics and guest teaches widely in the United States and abroad (School of Bolshoi).

[[File:Textbook.JPG|thumb|Textbook]]
A '''textbook''' or '''coursebook''' ([[British English|UK English]]) is a manual of instruction in any branch of study. Textbooks are produced according to the demands of educational institutions. '''Schoolbooks''' are textbooks and other books used in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|schoolbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/schoolbook|title=schoolbook - definition of schoolbook in English from the Oxford dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818041404/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/schoolbook|archivedate=18 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, most textbooks aren't published exclusively in printed format; many are now available as online [[e-book|electronic books]].

==History==
The history of textbooks dates back to civilizations of ancient history. For example, [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] wrote ''texts'' intended for education. The modern textbook has its roots in the standardization made possible by the printing press. [[Johannes Gutenberg]] himself may have printed editions of Ars Minor, a schoolbook on Latin grammar by [[Aelius Donatus]]. Early textbooks were used by tutors and teachers, who used the books as instructional aids (e.g., alphabet books), as well as individuals who taught themselves.

The Greek philosopher [[Plato]] lamented the loss of knowledge because the media of transmission were changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wondermark.com/socrates-vs-writing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130020156/http://wondermark.com/socrates-vs-writing/ |archivedate=2013-01-30 |df= }} True Stuff: Socrates vs. the Written Word, January 27th, 2011. By David Malki&lt;/ref&gt; Before the invention of the [[Greek alphabet]] 2,500 years ago, knowledge and stories were recited aloud, much like [[Homer]]'s epic poems. The new technology of writing meant stories no longer needed to be memorized, a development Socrates feared would weaken the Greeks' mental capacities for memorizing and retelling. (Ironically, we know about Socrates' concerns only because they were written down by his student [[Plato]] in his famous Dialogues.) &lt;ref&gt;Marcia Clemmitt, "Learning Online Literacy," in "Reading Crisis?" CQ Researcher, Feb. 22, 2008, pp. 169-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next revolution for books came with the 15th-century invention of printing with changeable type. The invention is attributed to German metalsmith [[Johannes Gutenberg]], who cast type in molds using a melted metal alloy and constructed a wooden-screw [[printing press]] to transfer the image onto paper.

Gutenberg's first and only large-scale printing effort was the now iconic [[Gutenberg Bible]] in the 1450s — a Latin translation from the Hebrew Old Testament and the [[Greek New Testament]], copies of which can be viewed on the British Library website. Gutenberg's invention made mass production of texts possible for the first time. Although the Gutenberg Bible itself was expensive, printed books began to spread widely over European trade routes during the next 50 years, and by the 16th century, printed books had become more widely accessible and less costly.&lt;ref&gt;British Library, "Treasures in Full: Gutenberg Bible," http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/background.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compulsory education]] and the subsequent growth of schooling in Europe led to the printing of many standardized texts for children. Textbooks have become the primary teaching instrument for most children since the 19th century. Two textbooks of historical significance in United States schooling were the 18th century [[New England Primer]] and the 19th century [[McGuffey Readers]].

Technological advances change the way people interact with textbooks. Online and digital materials are making it increasingly easy for students to access materials other than the traditional print textbook. Students now have access to electronic and PDF books, online tutoring systems and video lectures. An example of an electronically published book, or e-book, is ''[[Principles of Biology]]'' from [[Nature Publishing Group|Nature Publishing]].

Most notably, an increasing number of authors are foregoing commercial publishers and offering their textbooks under a [[creative commons]] or other open license.

==Market==

===The "broken market"===
The textbook market does not operate in the same manner as most consumer markets.  First, the end consumers (students) do not select the product, and the people (faculty and professors) who do select the product do not purchase it.  Therefore, price is removed from the purchasing decision, giving the producer (publishers) disproportionate market power to set prices high.  However, some{{who|date=November 2017}} argue that textbooks are really part of another product; the class that the student registered to take.  But the price of the textbook still isn't typically taken into account when this occurs and isn't part of the perception of the product.  

This fundamental difference in the market is often cited as the primary reason that prices are high.  The term "broken market" first appeared in the economist James Koch's analysis of the market commissioned by the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, James P. [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED497025&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED497025 "An Economic Analysis of Textbook Prices and the Textbook Market"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622145100/http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED497025&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED497025 |date=2012-06-22 }}, 2006-09. Retrieved on 2012-06-12. ([http://www.immagic.com/eLibrary/CBICBT99/FIN_AID/US_ED/A060923K.pdf Alternative location (PDF)])&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation is exacerbated by the lack of competition in the textbook market.  [[Consolidation (business)|Consolidation]] in the past few decades{{when|date=December 2011}} has reduced the number of major textbook companies from around 30 to just a handful.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Marla Matzer. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110523050151/http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/08/05/20070805-D1-01.html City at the head of the class: Consolidation, talent pool have made Columbus a hotbed for educational publishers.] August 5, 2007. Retrieved 2/14/09. Archived from [http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/08/05/20070805-D1-01.html the original] on 23 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, there is less competition than there used to be, and the high cost of starting up keeps new companies from entering.

===New editions and the used book market===
Students seek relief from rising prices through the purchase of [[resale|used copies]] of textbooks, which tend to be less expensive.  Most college bookstores offer used copies of textbooks at lower prices.  Most bookstores will also buy used copies back from students at the end of a term if the book is going to be re-used at the school.  Books that are not being re-used at the school are often purchased by an off-campus wholesaler for 0-30% of the new cost, for distribution to other bookstores where the books will be sold.  Textbook companies have countered this by encouraging faculty to assign homework that must be done on the publisher's website.  If a student has a new textbook, then he or she can use the pass code in the book to register on the site.  If the student has purchased a used textbook, then he or she must pay money directly to the publisher in order to access the website and complete assigned homework.

Students who look beyond the campus bookstore can typically find lower prices.  With the ISBN or title, author and edition, most textbooks can be located through online used book sellers or retailers.

Most leading textbook companies publish a new edition every 3 or 4 years, more frequently in math &amp; science.  Harvard economics chair James K. Stock has stated that new editions are often not about significant improvements to the content. "New editions are to a considerable extent simply another tool used by publishers and textbook authors to maintain their revenue stream, that is, to keep up prices," &lt;ref&gt;But, in fact, no revenue from used book sales flows either to the publisher or to the author of the work.  New editions serve to keep revenues flowing to publishers and authors, but do not affect prices paid for used older editions.

''The Harvard Crimson,'' 4 March 2008. Retrieved on 7 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by The Student [[Public Interest Research Group|PIRGs]] found that a new edition costs 12% more than a new copy of previous edition, and 58% more than a used copy of the previous edition. Textbook publishers maintain these new editions are driven by faculty demand.  The Student PIRGs' study found that 76% of faculty said new editions were justified “half of the time or less” and 40% said they were justified “rarely” or “never.”&lt;ref name="ripoff-101"&gt;[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101 Rip-off 101: How the Current Practices of the Textbook Industry Drive Up the Cost of College Textbooks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322211618/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101 |date=2010-03-22 }} The Student PIRGs (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The PIRG study has been criticized by publishers, who argue that the report contains factual inaccuracies regarding the annual average cost of textbooks per student.&lt;ref&gt;Capriccioso, Rob. [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/08/29/textbooks Throwing Down the Book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029025709/http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/08/29/textbooks |date=2008-10-29 }}. ''Inside Higher Ed'', August 29, 2006. Retrieved 2/14/09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Student PIRGs also point out that recent emphasis on electronic textbooks, or "eTextbooks," does not always save students money.  Even though the book costs less up-front, the student will not recover any of the cost through resale.&lt;ref name="course-correction"&gt;Allen, Nicole. [http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/course-correction Course Correction: How Digital Textbooks Are Off Track and How to Set Them Straight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322211602/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/course-correction |date=2010-03-22 }}. The Student PIRGs (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bundling===
Another publishing industry practice that has been highly criticized is "bundling," or shrink-wrapping supplemental items into a textbook. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}  Supplemental items range from CD-ROMs and workbooks to online passcodes and bonus material.  Students do not always have the option to purchase these items separately, and often the one-time-use supplements destroy the resale value of the textbook.&lt;ref name="required-reading"&gt;[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/required-reading Required Reading: A Look at the Words Publishing Tactics at Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314064817/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/required-reading |date=2010-03-14 }}, The Student PIRGs (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Student PIRGs, the typical bundled textbook is 10%-50% more than an unbundled textbook, and 65% of professors said they “rarely” or “never” use the bundled items in their courses.&lt;ref name="ripoff-101"/&gt;

A 2005 [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) Report found that the production of these supplemental items was the primary cause of rapidly increasing prices:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
While publishers, retailers, and wholesalers all play a role in textbook pricing, the primary factor contributing to increases in the price of textbooks has been the increased investment publishers have made in new products to enhance instruction and learning...While wholesalers, retailers, and others do not question the quality of these materials, they have expressed concern that the publishers’ practice 
of packaging supplements with a textbook to sell as one unit limits the opportunity students have to purchase less expensive used books....If publishers continue to increase these investments, particularly in technology, the cost to produce a textbook is likely to continue to increase in the future.&lt;ref name=GAO&gt;"[http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/abstract.php?rptno=GAO-05-806 College Textbooks: Enhanced Offerings Appear to Drive Recent Price Increases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619071824/http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/abstract.php?rptno=GAO-05-806 |date=2008-06-19 }}." U.S. Government Accountability Office, Washington, DC, 2005. Abstract. Retrieved 7 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bundling has also been used as a means of segmenting the used book market.  Each combination of a textbook and supplemental items receives a separate ISBN.  A single textbook could therefore have dozens of ISBNs that denote different combinations of supplements packaged with that particular book.  When a bookstore attempts to track down used copies of textbooks, they will search for the ISBN the course instructor orders, which will locate only a subset of the copies of the textbook.

Legislation on the state and federal level seeks to limit the practice of bundling, by requiring publishers to offer all components separately.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/campaign/hr4137 Analysis of Textbook Affordability Provisions in H.R. 4137] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124161237/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/campaign/hr4137 |date=2009-11-24 }}, The Student PIRGs&lt;/ref&gt;  Publishers have testified in favor of bills including this provision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2008A/commsumm.nsf/58e6d054c29cbe1287256e5f00670a70/78f66284de2d10b28725740400734883?OpenDocument|title=House Committee on Education (03/06/2008)|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413042944/http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2008A/commsumm.nsf/58e6d054c29cbe1287256e5f00670a70/78f66284de2d10b28725740400734883?OpenDocument|archivedate=13 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but only in the case that the provision exempts the loosely defined category of "integrated textbooks."

===Price disclosure===
Given that the problem of high textbook prices is linked to the "broken" economics of the market, requiring publishers to disclose textbook prices to faculty is a solution pursued by a number of legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/04/13/textbooks|title=Textbook Battle's New Frontier|author=Elia Powers|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821104447/https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/04/13/textbooks|archivedate=21 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By inserting price into sales interactions, this regulation will supposedly make the economic forces operate more normally.

No data suggests that this is in fact true.  However, The Student PIRGs have found that publishers actively withhold pricing information from faculty, making it difficult to obtain.  Their most recent study found that 77% of faculty say publisher sales representatives do not volunteer prices, and only 40% got an answer when they directly asked.

===Used textbook market===
Once a textbook is purchased from a retailer for the first time, there are several ways a student can sell his/her textbooks back at the end of the semester or later. Students can sell to 1) the college/university bookstore; 2) fellow students; 3) a number of online websites; or 4) a student swap service.

====Campus buyback====
As for buyback on a specific campus, faculty decisions largely determine how much a student receives. If a professor chooses to use the same book the following semester, even if it is a custom text, designed specifically for an individual instructor, bookstores often buy the book back. The GAO report found that, generally, if a book is in good condition and will be used on the campus again the next term, bookstores will pay students 50 percent of the original price paid. If the bookstore has not received a faculty order for the book at the end of the term and the edition is still current, they may offer students the wholesale price of the book, which could range from 5 to 35 percent of the new retail price, according to the GAO report.&lt;ref name=GAO/&gt;

When students resell their textbooks during campus “buyback” periods, these textbooks are often sold into the national used textbook distribution chain.  If a textbook is not going to be used on campus for the next semester of courses then many times the college bookstore will sell that book to a national used book company.  The used book company then resells the book to another college bookstore.  Finally, that book is sold as used to a student at another college at a price that is typically 75% of the new book price. At each step, a markup is applied to the book to enable the respective companies to continue to operate.

====Student to student sales====
Students can also sell or trade textbooks among themselves. After completing a course, sellers will often seek out members of the next enrolling class, people who are likely to be interested in purchasing the required books. This may be done by posting flyers to advertise the sale of the books or simply soliciting individuals who are shopping in the college bookstore for the same titles. Many larger schools have independent websites set up for the purpose of facilitating such trade. These often operate much like digital classified ads, enabling students to list their items for sale and browse for those they wish to acquire. Also, at the [[US Air Force Academy]], it is possible to [[e-mail]] entire specific classes, allowing for an extensive network of textbook sales to exist.

====Student online marketplaces====
Online marketplaces are one of the two major types of online websites students can use to sell used textbooks. Online marketplaces may have an [[Online auction business model|online auction]] format or may allow the student to list their books for a fixed price. In either case, the student must create the listing for each book themselves and wait for a buyer to order, making the use of marketplaces a more passive way of selling used textbooks. Unlike campus buyback and online book, students are unlikely to sell all their books to one buyer using online marketplaces, and will likely have to send out multiple books individually.

====Online book buyers====
Online book buyers buy textbooks, and sometimes other types of books, with the aim of reselling them for a profit. Like online marketplaces, online book buyers operate year-round, giving students the opportunity to sell their books even when campus "buyback" periods are not in effect. Students enter the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] numbers of the books they wish to sell and receive a price quote or offer. These online book buyers often offer "free shipping" (which in actuality is built into the offer for the book), and allow students to sell multiple books to the same source. Because online book buyers are buying books for resale, the prices they offer may be lower than students can get on online marketplaces. However, their prices are competitive, and they tend to focus on the convenience of their service. Some even claim that buying used textbooks online and selling them to online book buyers has a lower total cost than even textbook rental services.

====Textbook exchanges====
In response to escalating textbook prices, limited competition, and to provide a more efficient system to connect buyers and sellers together, online textbook exchanges were developed. Most of today's sites handle buyer and seller payments, and usually deduct a small commission only after the sale is completed.

According to textbook author [[Henry L. Roediger III|Henry L. Roediger]] (and Wadsworth Publishing Company senior editor Vicki Knight), the used textbook market is illegitimate, and entirely to blame for the rising costs of textbooks.  As methods of "dealing with this problem", he recommends making previous editions of textbooks obsolete, binding the textbook with other materials, and passing laws to prevent the sale of used books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/why-are-textbooks-so-expensive|magazine=Observer|publisher=Association for Psychological Science|title=Why Are Textbooks So Expensive?|author=Henry L. Roediger, III|date=January 2005|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317041203/https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/why-are-textbooks-so-expensive|archivedate=17 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is not unlike the limited licensing approach for computer software, which places rigid restrictions on resale and reproduction.  The intent is to make users understand that the content of any textbook is the intellectual property of the author and/or the publisher, and that as such, subject to copyright. Obviously, this idea is completely opposed to the millennia-old tradition of the sale of [[used book]]s, and would make that entire industry illegal.

==== E-textbooks ====
Another alternative to save money and obtaining the materials you are required are e-textbooks.The article "E books rewrite the rules of education" states that, alternately to spending a lot of money on textbooks, you can purchase an e-textbook at a small amount of the cost. With the growth of digital applications for iPhone, and gadgets like the Amazon kindle, e-textbooks are not an innovation, but have been "gaining momentum".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ebooks Rewrite the Rules of Education|url = http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Ebooks-Rewrite-the--Rules-of-Education-53676.htm|website = EContent Magazine|last = Mullan|first = Eileen|date = 4 May 2009|access-date = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180317231848/http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Ebooks-Rewrite-the--Rules-of-Education-53676.htm|archivedate = 17 March 2018|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the article " Are textbooks obsolete?", publishers and editorials are concerned about the issue of expensive textbooks. "The expense of textbooks is a concern for students, and e-textbooks, address the face of the issue, Williams says " As publishers we understand the high cost of these materials, and the electronic format  permit us diminish the general expense of our content to the market".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Are textbooks obsolete?

=== Rental programs ===
In-store rentals are processed by either using a kiosk and ordering books online with a third party facilitator or renting directly from the store's inventory. Some stores use a hybrid of both methods, opting for in-store selections of the most popular books and the online option for more obscure titles or books they consider too risky to put in the rental system.

=== Textbook sharing ===
Another method to help students save money that is coming up is called Textbooks Sharing. Using textbook sharing the students share the physical textbook with other students, and also the cost of the book is divided among the users of the textbook. So over the life of the textbook, if 4 students use the textbook, the cost of the textbook for each student will be 25% of the total cost of the book.

=== Open textbooks ===
{{main|Open textbook}}
The latest trend in textbooks is "open textbooks." An [[open textbook]] is a free, openly licensed textbook offered online by its author(s).  According to PIRG, a number of textbooks already exist, and are being used at schools such as MIT and Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;See PIRG's [http://www.studentpirgs.org/open-textbooks/catalog Catalog of Open Textbooks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324125700/http://www.studentpirgs.org/open-textbooks/catalog |date=2010-03-24 }} for examples of open textbooks&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 study published found that open textbooks offer a viable and attractive means to meet faculty and student needs while offering savings of approximately 80% compared to traditional textbook options.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentpirgs.org/uploads/66/4d/664d09ba9bc97cc9138eda5faac5e061/A-Cover-To-Cover-Solution.pdf A Cover to Cover Solution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226015800/http://www.studentpirgs.org/uploads/66/4d/664d09ba9bc97cc9138eda5faac5e061/A-Cover-To-Cover-Solution.pdf |date=2010-12-26 }} by Nicole Allen of the Student PIRGs. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the largest question seems to be who is going to pay to write them, several state policies suggest that public investment in open textbooks might make sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_2251-2300/ab_2261_bill_20080221_introduced.html|title=AB 2261   Assembly Bill - INTRODUCED|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304135209/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_2251-2300/ab_2261_bill_20080221_introduced.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} To offer another perspective{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, any jurisdiction might find itself challenged to find sufficient numbers of credible academics who would be willing to undertake the effort of creating an open textbook without realistic compensation, in order to make such a proposal work.

The other challenge involves the reality of publishing, which is that textbooks with good sales and profitability subsidize the creation and publication of low demand but believed to be necessary textbooks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Subsidies skew markets and the elimination of subsidies is disruptive; in the case of low demand textbooks the possibilities following subsidy removal include any or all of the following: higher retail prices, a switch to open textbooks, a reduction of the number of titles published.

On the other hand, independent open textbook authoring and publishing models are developing.  Most notably, the startup publisher [[Flat World Knowledge]] already has dozens of college-level open textbooks that are used by  more than 900 institutions in 44 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressitt.com/smnr/Flat-World-Knowledge-President-Eric-Frank-Addresses-Oregon-Legislators-on-Solving-Textbook-Affordability-/3569/ Flat World Knowledge President Eric Frank Addresses Oregon Legislators on Solving Textbook Affordability.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223233038/http://pressitt.com/smnr/Flat-World-Knowledge-President-Eric-Frank-Addresses-Oregon-Legislators-on-Solving-Textbook-Affordability-/3569/ |date=2011-02-23 }} Pressitt.

===International market pricing===

Similar to the issue of reimportation of [[pharmaceuticals]] into the U.S. market, the GAO report&lt;ref name=GAO/&gt; also highlights a similar phenomenon in textbook distribution. Retailers and publishers have expressed concern about the re-importation of lower-priced textbooks from international locations. Specifically, they cited the ability students have to purchase books from online distribution channels outside the United States at lower prices, which may result in a loss of sales for U.S. retailers. Additionally, the availability of lower-priced textbooks through these channels has heightened distrust and frustration among students regarding textbook prices, and college stores find it difficult to explain why their textbook prices are higher, according to the National Association of College Stores. Retailers and publishers have also been concerned that some U.S. retailers may have engaged in reimportation on a large scale by ordering textbooks for entire courses at lower prices from international distribution channels.  While the 1998 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision [[Quality King v. L'anza]] protects the reimportation of copyrighted materials under the [[first-sale doctrine]], textbook publishers have still attempted to prevent the U.S. sale of international editions by enforcing contracts which forbid foreign wholesalers from selling to American distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tamar |last=Lewin |title=Students Find $100 Textbooks Cost $50, Purchased Overseas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/us/students-find-100-textbooks-cost-50-purchased-overseas.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 October 2003 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916004116/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/us/students-find-100-textbooks-cost-50-purchased-overseas.html |archivedate=16 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about the effects of differential pricing on college stores, the National Association of College Stores has called on publishers to stop the practice of selling textbooks at lower prices outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testimony of Marc L.

The authors often getting half-royalties instead of full-royalties, minus the charges for returned books from bookstores.

===Production===

====Cost distribution====
According to the National Association of College Stores, the entire cost of the book is justified by expenses, with typically 11.7% of the price of a new book going to the author's royalties (or a committee of editors at the publishing house), 22.7% going to the store, and 64.6% going to the publisher.  The store and publisher amounts are slightly higher for Canada. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
Bookstores and used-book vendors profit from the resale of textbooks on the used market, with publishers only earning profits on sales of new textbooks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

====Research====
According to the GAO study published July 2005:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Following closely behind annual increases in tuition and fees at postsecondary institutions, college textbook and supply prices have risen at twice the rate of annual inflation over the last two decades.

Rising at an average of 6 percent each year since academic year 1987-1988, compared with overall average price increases of 3 percent per year, college textbook and supply prices trailed tuition and fee increases, which averaged 7 percent per year. Since December 1986, textbook and supply prices have nearly tripled, increasing by 186 percent, while tuition and fees increased by 240 percent and overall prices grew by 72 percent. While increases in textbook and supply prices have followed increases in tuition and fees, the cost of textbooks and supplies for degree-seeking students as a percentage of tuition and fees varies by the type of institution attended. For example, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student for academic year 2003-2004 was $898 at 4-year public institutions, or about 26 percent of the cost of tuition and fees. At 2-year public institutions, where low-income students are more likely to pursue a degree program and tuition and fees are lower, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student was $886 in academic year 2003-2004, representing almost three-quarters of the cost of tuition and fees.&lt;ref name=GAO/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the 2nd edition of a study by the United States Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG) published in February 2005{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}: ''"Textbook prices are increasing at more than four times the inflation rate for all finished goods, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index. The wholesale prices charged by textbook publishers have jumped 62 percent since 1994, while prices charged for all finished goods increased only 14 percent. Similarly, the prices charged by publishers for general books increased just 19 percent during the same time period."''

According to the 2007 edition of the College Board’s Trend in College Pricing Report published October 2007{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}: ''"College costs continue to rise and federal student aid has shown slower growth when adjusted for inflation, while textbooks, as a percentage of total college costs, have remained steady at about 5 percent."''

==K-12 textbooks==
In most U.S. [[K-12]] public schools, a local school board votes on which textbooks to purchase from a selection of books that have been approved by the state Department of Education. Teachers receive the books to give to the students for each subject. Teachers are usually not required to use textbooks, however, and many prefer to use other materials instead.

Textbook publishing in the U.S. is a business primarily aimed at large states. This is due to state purchasing controls over the books, most notably in Texas, where the [[Texas Education Agency]] sets curricula for all courses taught by the state's 1,000+ school districts, and therefore also approves which textbooks can be purchased.

===High school===
In recent years, high school textbooks of United States history have come under increasing criticism. Authors such as [[Howard Zinn]] (''[[A People's History of the United States]]''), [[Gilbert T. Sewall]] (''[[Textbooks: Where the Curriculum Meets the Child]]'') and [[James W. Loewen]] (''[[Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong]]''), make the claim that [[History of the United States|U.S. history]] textbooks contain mythical untruths and omissions, which paint a whitewashed picture that bears little resemblance to what most students learn in universities. Inaccurately retelling history, through textbooks or other literature, has been practiced in many societies, from ancient [[Rome]] to the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) and the [[People's Republic of China]]. The content of history textbooks is often determined by the political forces of state adoption boards and ideological pressure groups.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Science textbooks have been the source of ongoing debates and have come under scrutiny from several organizations. The presentation or inclusion of controversial scientific material has been debated in several court cases. Poorly designed textbooks have been cited as contributing to declining grades in mathematics and science in the United States and organizations such as the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (AAAS) have criticized the layout, presentation, and amount of material given in textbooks.

Discussions of textbooks have been included on [[Creationism|creation]] and [[evolution]] in the public education debate. The ''[[Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County]]'' case brought forward a debate about scientific fact being presented in textbooks.

In his book, ''[[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!]]'', the late physics [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Richard P. Feynman]] described his experiences as a member of a committee that evaluated science textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://textbooks.org/2012/09/book-review-surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman/|title=Book Review: Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!|work=Textbooks.org - Compare Textbook Prices|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508135103/http://textbooks.org/2012/09/book-review-surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman/|archivedate=8 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some instances, there were nonsensical examples to illustrate physical phenomena; then a company sent — for reasons of timing — a textbook that contained blank pages, which even got good critiques. Feynman himself experienced attempts at bribery.

== Mathematics ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Largely in the US, but increasingly in other nations, K-12 Mathematics textbooks have reflected the controversies of [[new math]] and [[reform mathematics]] which have sought to replace [[traditional mathematics]] in what have been called the [[math wars]]. Traditional texts, still favored in Asia and other areas, merely taught the same time-tested mathematics that most adults have learned. By contrast "progressive" approaches seek to address problems in social inequity{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} with approaches that often incorporate principles of [[Constructivist teaching methods|constructivism]] and discovery. Texts such as [[Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space|TERC]] and [[Connected Mathematics|CMP]] discourage or omit standard mathematics methods and concepts such as long division and lowest common denominators. For example, an index entry to multiply fractions would lead to "devise your own method to multiply fractions which work on these examples", and the formula for the area of a circle would be an exercise for a student to derive rather than including it in the student text. By the 2000s, while some districts were still adopting the more novel methods, others had abandoned them as unworkable.

==Higher education==
In the U.S., college and university textbooks are chosen by the professor teaching the course, or by the department as a whole. Students are typically responsible for obtaining their own copies of the books used in their courses, although alternatives to owning textbooks, such as textbook rental services and library reserve copies of texts, are available in some instances.

In some European countries, such as Sweden or Spain, students attending institutions of higher education pay for textbooks themselves, although higher education is free of charge otherwise.

With higher education costs on the rise, many students are becoming sensitive to every aspect of college pricing, including textbooks, which in many cases amount to one tenth of tuition costs. The 2005 Government Accountability Office report on college textbooks said that since the 1980s, textbook and supply prices have risen twice the rate of inflation in the past two decades{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.  A 2005 PIRG study found that textbooks cost students $900 per year, and that prices &lt;ref name=GAO /&gt; increased four times the rate of inflation over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101-2nd-edition Rip-off 101: Second Edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314064841/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101-2nd-edition |date=2010-03-14 }}, The Student PIRGs (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  A June 2007 Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) report, “Turn the Page,” reported that the average U.S. student spends $700–$1000 per year on textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/acsfa/edlite-txtbkstudy.html|title=Archived: Advisory Committee for Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) - U.S. Department of Education|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509204934/http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/acsfa/edlite-txtbkstudy.html|archivedate=9 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many groups have assigned blame to publishers, bookstores or faculty, the ACSFA also found that assigning blame to any one party—faculty, colleges, bookstores or publishers—for current textbook costs is unproductive and without merit. The report called on all parties within the industry to work together to find productive solutions, which included a movement toward [[open textbook]]s and other lower-cost digital solutions.

Textbook prices are considerably higher in law school. Students ordinarily pay close to $200 for case books consisting of cases available free online.

==Textbook bias on controversial topics==
In cases of history, science, current events, and political textbooks, "the writer might be biased towards one way or another. Topics such as actions of a country, presidential actions, and scientific theories are common potential biases".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Inclusive education ==
Textbooks are an important aspect of [[Inclusion (education)|inclusive education]] in how they incorporate inclusive language, diverse identities, and human rights, particularly as they reflect issues of culture, gender, and religion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002473/247337e.pdf|title=Making textbook content inclusive: A focus on religion, culture and gender|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100203-8|location=|pages=8–11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421001802/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002473/247337e.pdf|archivedate=2017-04-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture ===
The defense of [[cultural diversity]], as understood by [[UNESCO]], is an ethical imperative, inseparable from children’s universal [[right to education]]. It implies a commitment to the fundamental rights of persons belonging to minorities and to the [[cultural rights]] that are an integral part of [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 27, and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Articles 13 and 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Culture is also central to contemporary debates on citizenship and identity, social cohesion, and the growth of knowledge- based economies. Education has a major part to play in shaping such dialogues as cultural exchanges and economic cooperation become increasingly more common. Textbooks can be used to promote cultural diversity and, in particular, nurture culture in its broadest sense understood as the “whole complex of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features that characterize a society or social group.”&lt;ref&gt;Mexico City Declaration on Cultural Policies, World Conference on Cultural Policies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gender ===
Having concentrated on rooting out [[Racism|racist]] and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] prejudice in textbooks as early as 1946, in the 1970s UNESCO started to tackle [[gender stereotypes]], which are recognized as a source of enduring inequality between women and men. A research programme on the image of women was launched after the 1980 Copenhagen World Conference of the [[United Nations Decade for Women]] to identify and characterize sexism and recommend various steps to eliminate it.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Andrée Michel (1986). Down with stereotypes! Eliminating sexism from children’s literature and school textbooks. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; The programme showed that [[sexism]] in textbooks often consists of failing to recognize the range of actual roles played by men and women in society and neglecting the real advances that have been made in terms of gender equality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Textbooks should help students understand the roles most often assigned to women and men and recognize those aspects of social change needed to build a fairer social order that includes both sexes and [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]] on an equal footing with the mainstream society. Discussions prompted by reading textbooks and teacher-pupil interactions can be used to address, question, and dismiss stereotypes. Relating examples from past societies and telling stories that give prominence to other gender categories (besides men and women) and other [[sexual orientation]]s (besides [[heterosexuality]]) can show the prejudicial effect of the division of humankind into two sexes and the imposition of heterosexuality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Religion ===
With the rise of [[globalization]], the multiplicity of world views and religious practices that individuals confront has increased. Textbooks are instrumental in the process of raising awareness about others’ beliefs and fostering understanding of, and respect for, the diversity of beliefs present in societies and the world at large. Textbooks can help to combat prejudice, present pluralism as an asset, and encourage mutual understandings based on respect for the right to express one’s beliefs. They contribute to promoting tolerance, critical thinking in the face of divisive stereotyping and discrimination, and the independence of individual choice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Wilfrid Spencer Leng''' (October 21, 1952 – August 30, 2002) was a mathematician and writer who contributed his 'Theory of Everything' to the search for a [[Unified Field Theory]] that would combine [[Einstein]]'s [[General Theory of Relativity]] with [[quantum mechanics]].

Born in [[Croydon]] in 1952, Leng was educated at [[Dulwich College]] in London and then at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary|last=Schuler|first=CJ|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1712747.html|accessdate=August 22, 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=September 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He taught for a time at [[Millfield School]]. In 1983, he published his collection of verse, ''Sing England to Italy''. These poems were described by the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] Sir [[John Betjeman]] as "deeply felt and... very beautiful".&lt;ref name="Sing England to Italy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leng|first=Wilfrid|title=Sing England to Italy|date=1983|publisher=Greenway Press|isbn=978-0950812540|pages=Back cover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leng taught creative writing,&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindsay&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindsay|first=Andrew|title=The Washing Machine Man's Travels|date=2005|publisher=Greenworldbooks|isbn=978-0955008306|pages=399|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QiixaO74XMwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:0955008301&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VnbJnHCGzI&amp;sig=YoswO4pgYE3uljGXgWwZtDZsSKQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6S81UIriM43s0gWV2oCABg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a further education teacher, he delivered such diverse subjects as philosophy, cosmology, science and history, and gave the annual Einstein Lectures at [[Croydon College]]. However, his major preoccupation was with mathematical physics, and after delivering papers to a number of major mathematical conferences during the 1990s, in 1999 Leng produced his ''The Theory-of-Everything Equation'', in which "all things originate in and constantly communicate with a 'multiverse' that produces 'points' which turn, thus producing the cosmos".&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt;

Leng died in London in 2002,&lt;ref name="LMS Obituary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wilfrid Leng|url=http://old.lms.ac.uk/newsletter/0210/obituaries.html|accessdate=August 22, 2012|newspaper=London Mathematical Society Newsletter|date=November 5, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  after contracting an illness while attending a mathematical conference in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name=Obituary/&gt;

'''Pope.L''' (also known as William Pope.L, born 1955 in [[Newark, New Jersey]]) is an American visual artist best known for his work in [[performance art]], and interventionist public art. However, he has also produced art in [[painting]], [[photography]] and [[theater]]. He was included in the 2002 [[Whitney Biennial]] and is a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] and a recipient of the [[Creative Capital]] Visual Arts Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://creative-capital.org/projects/view/180 "The Black Factory"], Creative Capital.&lt;/ref&gt; Selected now for the second time, Pope.L will be included in the upcoming [[Whitney Biennial]] of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2017Biennial|title=Whitney Biennial 2017 {{!}} Whitney Museum of American Art|website=whitney.org|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Pope.L attended [[Pratt Institute]] from 1973 to 1975 and participated in the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] Independent Study Program from 1977 to 1978.&lt;ref name="bio_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/recipients/popel|title=Pope.L :: Foundation for Contemporary Arts|website=www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/independentstudy80whit|title=Independent Study Program : fifteenth anniversary / Whitney Museum of American Art.|first=|last=Whitney Museum of American Art|date=29 June 1983|publisher=Whitney Museum of American Art|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Montclair State University]], [[Montclair, New Jersey]], in 1978.&lt;ref name="bio_1"/&gt; He received a [[Master of Fine Arts]] degree in visual arts from the [[Mason Gross School of the Arts]] at [[Rutgers University]], [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newfaculty.uchicago.edu/page/william-popel|title=William Pope.L - New Members of the University Faculty - The University of Chicago|website=newfaculty.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==
From 1990 to 2010, Pope.L was a lecturer of [[Theater]] and [[Rhetoric]] at [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine]]. As a faculty member he directed a production of [[Lorraine Hansberry]]'s ''[[A Raisin In the Sun]]'', in which he used both African-American and Caucasian actors as members of the same family.

For ''ATM Piece'', performed in 1997, he attached himself with an eight-foot length of Italian sausage to the door of a [[Chase Bank]] in midtown Manhattan wearing nothing but a skirt made out of dollar bills.&lt;ref&gt;ArtForum, April 2004 http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_/ai_n6080072 {{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''eRacism'', a project that Pope.L began during the late 1970s, included over 40 [[endurance]]-based performances consisting of “crawls”, varying in length and duration.  In one example titled ''Tompkins Square Crawl'' (1991) Pope.L dressed in a business suit and crawled through the gutter in [[Tompkins Square Park]], New York, pushing a potted flower with one hand.  Another example titled ''The Great White Way'' involved a crawl which stretched over 22 miles and took five years to complete. For this performance he donned a [[Superman]] outfit and strapped a skateboard to his back. The crawl stretched the entire 22 miles of Broadway, in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_5_91/ai_101010684/pg_2 {{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Documentation of this performance was included in the 2002 [[Whitney Biennial]].

==2001 – 2010==
In 2001 the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA) advisory renew panel granted Pope.L $42,000 in financing for a traveling retrospective called "William Pope.L: eRacism". Shortly after announcing the award, the acting chairman, [[Robert S. Martin]], rescinded funding for the grant.&lt;ref&gt;Art in America Feb 2002 http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_/ai_82748785 {{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joel Wachs]], then president of the Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, stated in the December 21 issue of ''[[The New York Times]]'': &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is important, particularly in light of what I would consider an attack on freedom of expression, to stand firm.  We want this exhibition to occur; we want other funders to step forward; we don't want the N.E.A.'s decision to be something that has the effect of stopping what I think is going to be an important exhibition of art." &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Warhol Foundation, in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation and the LEF Foundation provided $50,000 in funding for the traveling retrospective to tour the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Pogrebin, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803EFDE113EF932A15751C1A9679C8B63 "Warhol Foundation Finances Work Rebuffed by N.E.A."], ''The New York Times'', December 21,
 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''eRacism'' exhibited at the Institute of Contemporary Art at Maine College of Art; Diverse Works Art space, Houston, 2003; [[Portland Institute for Contemporary Art]] (PICA), Oregon, 2003; and Artists Space, New York, 2003 .

The catalog "William Pope.L: Friendliest Black Artist in America" was produced by curator Mark Bessire in conjunction with the retrospective exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Bessire, Mark H.C., William Pope.L: The Friendliest Black Artist in America, MIT Press, Cambridge Massachusetts – London, England, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Pope.L received a [[Foundation for Contemporary Arts]] Grants to Artists award. In 2004 he received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]] Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/11658-william-popel |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509135323/http://www.gf.org/fellows/11658-william-popel |archivedate=2013-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 ''The Black Factory'', an art installation on wheels, traveled from Maine to Missouri as part of [[The Interventionists]] show organized by the [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]] (Mass MOCA). "Typically the Factory arrives at a city or town and sets up its interactive workshop on the street. People bring objects that represent blackness to them. The Factory’s workers use these objects in tightly rehearsed but loosely performed skits to stimulate a conversation — a flow of ideas, images and experiences. Most objects are photographed and made part of the Factory’s virtual library, some are housed in the Factory’s archive for later use, and some are pulverized in the Factory’s workshop to make new products available in the Factory’s gift shop."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporarystl.org/pro_blackfactory.php|title=Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis|website=Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 he was selected as one of the United States Artists fellows,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public2/USAFellows/2006Fellows/Alphabetically/WilliamPopeL/index.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914195558/http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public2/USAFellows/2006Fellows/Alphabetically/WilliamPopeL/index.cfm |archivedate=2010-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he was awarded a $50,000 unrestricted grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public2/About/index.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025053555/http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public2/About/index.cfm |archivedate=2008-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was featured alongside other performing artists: [[Sean Penn]], [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Steve Buscemi]], and [[Juliette Binoche]] in [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]]'s [[LAB HD]] portraits. In 2008, Pope.L's piece "One Substance, Eight Supports, One Situation" was selected to participate in [[The Renaissance Society]]'s group exhibition, "Black Is, Black Ain't".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renaissancesociety.org/site/Exhibitions/Intro.Black-Is-Black-Ain-t.595.html The Renaissance Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720142724/http://www.renaissancesociety.org/site/Exhibitions/Intro.Black-Is-Black-Ain-t.595.html |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Pope.L was appointed faculty at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dova.uchicago.edu/faculty/fac_pope.html|title=Core Faculty - Department of Visual Arts|website=dova.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent work==
In 2015 MOCA, Los Angeles presented ''Trinket'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moca.org/exhibition/william-popel-trinket|title=William Pope.L: Trinket|website=The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest solo museum presentation of Pope.L's work to date. The centerpiece of the show is ''Trinket'', a monumental, custom-made American flag (approximately 54 x 16 feet) hanging on a pole in the middle of the Geffen. During the museum's public hours the flag will be continuously blown by four large-scale industrial fans — the type used on Hollywood film sets to create wind or rain effects — and will be illuminated from below by a bank of custom theatrical lights. Over time the flag will appear to fray at its ends due to the constant whipping of the forced air, a potent metaphor for the rigors and complexities of democratic engagement and participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-pope-l-moca-review-20150324-column.html|title=William Pope.L sets the U.S. flag waving at the MOCA/Geffen|first=Christopher|last=Knight|website=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artforum.com/words/id=50371|title=William Pope.L|website=artforum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://old.theartnewspaper.com/articles/William-PopeL-wants-to-bring-down-the-house/37266 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906003611/http://old.theartnewspaper.com/articles/William-PopeL-wants-to-bring-down-the-house/37266 |archive-date=2015-09-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/reviews/william-popel-1/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409054455/http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/reviews/william-popel-1/ |date=2016-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Trinket'' was originally produced in 2008 at [[Grand Arts]], in Kansas City, Mo., as the centerpiece of Pope.L's exhibition  Animal Nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grandarts.com/past_projects/2008/2008_09.html|title=Grand Arts|website=grandarts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015 Pope.L 	produced ''The Beautiful'', a new choreographed crawl performance staged for the first time at [[Art Basel]] in [[Miami Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2015/12/03/muscle-men-and-free-cash-xavier-cha-and-pope-l-shine-at-art-basels-public-sector/|title=Muscle Men and Free Cash: Xavier Cha and Pope.L Shine at Art Basel’s Public Sector|first=John|last=Chiaverina|date=3 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For ''The Beautiful'', four men, dressed as Superman with [[skateboards]] strapped to their backs, roll onward in the dark. The rumbling of their wheels grows louder through speakers as they approach the crowd, and blends with the low churning of electric guitars. The ‘Super-Gents’ reach a wooden stage and crab-walk their way up, barely fitting onto the small surface. Holding each other, they finally break into a heart-rending, soulful version of the patriotic song America The Beautiful.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Quotes==
Pope.L's art focuses on issues of consumption, social class, and masculinity as they relate to race. He is quoted as saying of his own work: “I am a fisherman of social absurdity, if you will…  My focus is to politicize disenfranchisement, to make it neut, to reinvent what’s beneath us, to remind us where we all come from.&lt;ref&gt;Bessire, Mark H.C., William Pope.L: The Friendliest Black Artist in America, [[MIT Press]], Cambridge Massachusetts – London, England, 2002.pg.23&lt;/ref&gt;”

In his Foundation for [[Contemporary Arts]] Fellowship bio, he writes: "Like the African shaman who chews his pepper seeds and spits seven times into the air, I believe art re-ritualizes the everyday to reveal something fresh about our lives. This revelation is a vitality and it is a power to change the world.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/grant_recipients/popel.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018224957/http://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/grant_recipients/popel.html |archivedate=2008-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Worldwide Day of Play''''' is an annual event designed to encourage children and parents to turn off the television and play, especially outdoors. The yearly event officially began on all US Nickelodeon channels: [[Nickelodeon]], [[Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids|Nick GAS]] (until 2008), [[Nick Jr.|Noggin]] (now [[Nick Jr.]]), [[TeenNick|The N]] (now [[TeenNick]]), [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] and [[NickMusic]] on October 1, 2005. The event was first shown on October 2, 2004 on Nickelodeon. Some foreign versions of Nick also participated. The event is designed as a finale for Nick's six-month-long '''Let's Just Play''' campaign. In addition, Nick.com would also have special features for children to learn how to stay active and healthy.

==General purpose==
The event encourages children to think about getting away from the TV and being physically active. Schools and educational organizations have also been encouraged to host events around this theme.

As it has since 2004 (except 2018), Nickelodeon will suspend programming on WWDoP across all of its TV channels–Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., Nicktoons and TeenNick– and websites from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. (ET/PT) (where TV grid listings have this listed as "[[Off-the-air|Off air]]" or "Worldwide Day of Play") urging kids to “get up, go outside and play.”  According to Viacom, the owner of the Nickelodeon networks, millions of children and adults are expected to participate in "thousands of events in dozens of countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickpress-worldwidedayofplay.com/|publisher=Viacom International Inc|title=NICKELODEON TO CELEBRATE 10TH ANNUAL WORLDWIDE DAY OF PLAY WITH FLAGSHIP EVENT IN BROOKLYN’S PROSPECT PARK ON SEPT. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ''Let's Just Play'' campaign ended in September, Nickelodeon aired the finale during the last Saturday of September, the "Worldwide Day of Play". Nickelodeon and its sister channels suspend programming for three hours from 12 Noon to 3PM ET/PT. During the time there was no programming, a special message would appear on the screen. There was no ''Let's Just Play'' campaign in 2008, though the Day of Play was held that year.

Nickelodeon's 15th WWDoP will be taking place on September 29, 2018, but there is no "Off-Air" screen this year on the Nick networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickpress.com/press-releases/2018/05/23/nickelodeon-kicks-off-summer-celebration-of-play-bringing-worldwide-day-of-play-events-to-cities-across-the-country|publisher=Viacom International Inc|title=NICKELODEON KICKS OFF SUMMER CELEBRATION OF PLAY, BRINGING WORLDWIDE DAY OF PLAY EVENTS TO CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New episodes of Nickelodeon series==
After Nickelodeon resumes airing, they usually air marathons and premieres of [[TeenNick]] series, or ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. In 2007, ''SpongeBob SquarePants'', ''[[Just Jordan]]'', ''[[Tak and the Power of Juju (TV series)|Tak and the Power of Juju]]'', ''[[Zoey 101]]'', ''[[iCarly]]'', ''[[Back at the Barnyard]]'' had new episodes.

Following in 2009 and 2010, ''iCarly'' and ''[[True Jackson, VP]]'', and ''[[Big Time Rush]]'' had new episodes, with the inclusion of Nickelodeon's rebrand. Later followed in 2011, new episodes of ''iCarly'', ''Big Time Rush'' and ''[[Supah Ninjas]]'' aired. In 2012, before the Worldwide Day of Play begin, new episodes of ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' and ''[[Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness]]'' aired as well with an hour-long final season premiere of "iCarly" later that night with a sneak peek of See Dad Run following iCarly. For 2013, new episodes of ''[[Sanjay and Craig]]'' and ''[[Rabbids Invasion]]'' aired prior to the event, while premieres of ''[[Sam &amp; Cat]]'' and ''[[The Haunted Hathaways]]'' were shown that evening. In 2014, new episodes of ''Sanjay And Craig'' and ''[[Breadwinners (TV series)|Breadwinners]]'' were shown prior to the event, while new episodes of ''The Haunted Hathaways'', ''[[Henry Danger]]'', ''[[Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn]]'', ''[[The Thundermans]]'', and ''[[AwesomenessTV (TV series)|AwesomenessTV]]'' were shown in the evening. In 2015, new episodes of Henry Danger, Game Shakers, and 100 Things To Do Before High School had aired that evening. In 2016, season premieres of Henry Danger, Game Shakers, &amp; School Of Rock had aired that evening. In 2017, new episodes of Henry Danger and Game Shakers had aired that evening.
