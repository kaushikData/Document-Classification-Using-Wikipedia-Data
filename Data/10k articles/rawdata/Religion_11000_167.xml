'''''Amir al-hajj''''' ({{lang-ar|أمير الحج}}; [[transliteration]]: ''amīr al-ḥajj'', "[[amir|commander]] of the pilgrimage", or ''amīr al-ḥājj'', "commander of the pilgrim";{{sfn|Hathaway|2015}} plural: ''umarāʾ al-ḥajj''&lt;ref name="Phillipp102"&gt;Philipp,  1998,  p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WoPF9T4ZiWsC&amp;pg=PA102 102]&lt;/ref&gt;) was the position and title given to the commander of the annual [[Hajj]] pilgrim caravan by successive [[Muslim]] empires, from the 7th century until the 20th century. Since the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] period, there were two main caravans, departing from  [[Damascus]] and [[Cairo]].{{sfn|Hathaway|2015}} Each of the two caravans was annually assigned an ''amir al-hajj''. The main duties entrusted to an ''amir al-hajj'' were securing funds and [[wikt:provisioning|provisions]] for the caravan, and protecting it along the desert route to the Muslim holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] in the [[Hejaz]] (modern-day [[Saudi Arabia]]).&lt;ref name="Singer141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Damurdashi20"&gt;Al-Damurdashi, 1991, p.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOHEYxc6PwC&amp;pg=PA20 20]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Significance of the office==
According to historian Thomas Philipp, "the office of ''amir al-hajj'' was an extremely important one", which brought with it great political influence and religious prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp, 1998,  p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WoPF9T4ZiWsC&amp;pg=PA101 101]&lt;/ref&gt; Given the significance of the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage in [[Islam]], the protection of the caravan and its pilgrims was a priority for the Muslim rulers responsible. Any mishandling of the caravan or harm done to the pilgrims by [[Bedouin]] raiders would often be made known throughout the [[Muslim world]] by returning pilgrims. The leader of the Muslim world, or the ruler aspiring to this position, was required to ensure the pilgrimage's safety, and its success or failure significantly reflected on the ruler's prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Singer,  2002, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zHBHBTNwBQoC&amp;pg=PA142   142]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "talented and successful Hajj commanders were crucial".&lt;ref name="Singer141"&gt;Singer,  2002, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zHBHBTNwBQoC&amp;pg=PA141   141]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times, the importance of successful ''umara' al-hajj'' generally rendered them immune from punitive measures by the Ottoman authorities for abuses they committed elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Singer141"/&gt;

==Duties==
The main threat to a Hajj caravan was [[Bedouin]] raiding. An ''amir al-hajj'' would command a large military force to protect the caravan in the event of an attack by local Bedouin or would pay off the various Bedouin tribes whose territories the caravan inevitably traversed on the way to the Muslim holy cities in the Hejaz.&lt;ref name="Damurdashi20"/&gt; The procurement of supplies, namely water and foodstuffs, and transportation, namely camels, were also the responsibility of the ''amir al-hajj'', as was securing the funds to finance the pilgrimage. The funds mostly came from province revenues specifically designated for the Hajj.&lt;ref name="Singer141"/&gt; Some funds came from large endowments established by various [[Mamluks of Egypt|Mamluk]] and Ottoman sultans that were mainly meant to ensure the availability of water and supplies in the cities of Mecca and Medina to accommodate incoming pilgrims. The Cairene commander was responsible for the ''[[kiswah]]'', which was the black cloth that is annually draped over the [[Kaaba]] in Mecca.&lt;ref name="Dunn66"/&gt;

According to Singer and Philipp, an ''amir al-hajj'' needed to possess logistical capabilities in addition to military skills. To procure supplies and ensure safe transportation for the caravan, the ''amir al-hajj'' often maintained a network of connections to various Ottoman officials and local community leaders.&lt;ref name="Singer141"/&gt; An ''amir al-hajj'' brought with him an array of officials, including additional ''[[mamluk]]'' commanders to maintain order and religious functionaries, such as [[imam]]s, ''[[muezzin]]s'', ''[[qadi]]s'', all of whom were typically educated [[Arab]]s. Other officials included Arab desert guides, doctors, an official in charge of [[intestate]] affairs for pilgrims who died during the pilgrimage, and a ''[[muhtasib]]'' who was in charge of overseeing financial transactions.&lt;ref name="Dunn66"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Yahyâ ibn Mahmûd al-Wâsitî 005.jpg|thumb|right|An Arabic manuscript by [[al-Hariri of Basra]] depicting a Mamluk-era [[Hajj]] caravan en route to Mecca from the Levant, 1237]]

Muslim tradition ascribes the first Hajj caravan to the lifetime of [[Muhammad]], who in 630 ([[Anno Hegirae|AH]] 9) instructed [[Abu Bakr]] to lead 300 pilgrims from Medina to Mecca.{{sfn|Hathaway|2015}} With the [[Muslim conquests]], large numbers of pilgrims converged from all the corners of the expanding Muslim world. Under the [[Abbasids]], the tradition began of annual, state-sponsored caravans setting out from [[Damascus]] and [[Cairo]], with the pilgrim caravans from remoter regions usually joining them.{{sfn|Hathaway|2015}} A third major point of departure was [[Kufa]], where pilgrims from [[Mesopotamia|Iraq]], [[Persia|Iran]], and [[Central Asia]] gathered; Damascus gathered pilgrims from the [[Levant]] and in later times [[Anatolia]]; and [[Cairo]] gathered the pilgrims from [[Egypt]], [[Africa]], the [[Maghreb]], and [[al-Andalus]] (Spain).&lt;ref name="Sato134"&gt;Sato, 2014, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0eBTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134  134]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The early Abbasids placed much value on the symbolic importance of the pilgrimage, and in the first century of Abbasid rule, it was members of the ruling dynasty who were usually chosen to lead the caravans. Furthermore, Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] (r. 786–809) led the caravan in person several times.{{sfn|Hathaway|2015}} The specific year when the ''amir al-hajj'' office was established is not definitely known, but was likely in 978 CE when [[al-Aziz]], the [[caliph]] of the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] of Egypt, appointed Badis ibn Ziri to the position. The first ''amir al-hajj'' for the Kufa caravan was likely the Seljuk emir Qaymaz, appointed by Seljuk sultan [[Muhammad II ibn Mahmud|Muhammad II]] in 1157, and the first likely ''amir al-hajj'' for the Damascus caravan was [[Tughtakin ibn Ayyub]], appointed by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] sultan [[Saladin]] after the reconquest of [[Jerusalem]] from the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] in 1187.&lt;ref name="Sato134"/&gt; 

With the virtual destruction of the Abbasid Caliphate and its capital [[Baghdad]] by the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1258, the role of Damascus and Cairo as gathering and departure points for the Hajj caravan was elevated. The [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] was established two years later. From then on, Damascus served as the main gathering point for pilgrims from the Levant, Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Persia, while Cairo was the marshalling point for pilgrims coming from the [[Nile Valley]], [[North Africa]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Peters, 1994, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EK5MqskDYC0C&amp;pg=PA164  164]&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Jane Hathaway, it was under the Mamluks that the ''amir al-hajj'' assumed its "classical" form.{{sfn|Hathaway|2015}} Despite its importance, however, the Mamluks chose middle-ranking officials to lead the caravans—typically an ''amir mia muqaddam alf'' (commander of a thousand soldiers)&lt;ref name="Phillipp102-104"&gt;Philipp, 1998,  pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WoPF9T4ZiWsC&amp;pg=PA102 102]-104&lt;/ref&gt;—occasionally including freeborn Mamluks (''awlād al-nās''), who were considered of lower status than [[manumitted]] Mamluks.{{sfn|Hathaway|2015}} 

During the Mamluk era, the main pilgrimage caravan left from Cairo. Its ''amir al-hajj'' was always appointed by the sultan. The ''amir al-hajj'' of Damascus was either appointed by the sultan or his viceroy in Syria. The Damascene commander was generally subordinate to the Cairene commander, normally playing a neutral or supportive role to the latter in meetings or quarrels with the [[Sharif of Mecca|Meccan ''sharifs'']] or the caravan commanders from [[Iraq]] or [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="Dunn66"&gt;Dunn, 1986, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZF2spo9BKacC&amp;pg=PA66 66]&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ''[[kiswa]]'', the ceremonial covering for the [[Ka'aba]], was usually woven in Egypt, it was carried by the Cairo caravan, while the Damascene caravan carried the corresponding covering for Muhammad's tomb in Medina.{{sfn|Hathaway|2015}} A few Mamluk sultans made the pilgrimage themselves, but usually their symbolic presence was represented by a [[palanquin]] (''maḥmal''), escorted by musicians.{{sfn|Hathaway|2015}}

===Ottoman era===
[[File:The Mahmal which Conveyed the Holy Carpet to Mecca Surrounded by Cairo Police. (1911) - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[kiswah]]'' being transported from [[Cairo]] to [[Mecca]] surrounded by an Egyptian armed guard, 1911]]

The role of ''amir al-hajj'' was continued by the [[Ottoman Empire]] when they [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–17)|gained control over the Mamluks' territories]] in 1517. Besides the latter year, during which the Ottoman sultan appointed a bureaucrat to the post, the ''umara' al-hajj'' from Cairo for much of the 16th century continued to come from the ranks of [[Circassians|Circassian]] Mamluks with occasional appointments of important Arab sheikhs or high-ranking [[Bosniaks|Bosnian]] or [[Turkish people|Turkish]] officials.&lt;ref name="Phillipp102-104"/&gt; This was followed by a period where commanders for the Cairene caravan came from [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] until the early 18th century when the Mamluks of Egypt once again became the favored appointees for the office.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, 1994, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EK5MqskDYC0C&amp;pg=PA167  167]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 16th century, the ''amir al-hajj'' assigned to the caravan from Damascus commanded 100 ''[[sipahi]]'', professional troops who owned fiefs in [[Damascus Eyalet]] (Province of Damascus), and [[janissaries]], soldiers from the Damascus garrison. The first ''amir al-hajj'' for Damascus was the province's former Mamluk viceroy-turned Ottoman governor, [[Janbirdi al-Ghazali]]. Until 1571, the ''umara' al-hajj'' for Damascus were nominated from the high-ranking ''mamluks'' of Damascus, but afterward, ''mamluks'' and local leaders from lesser cities and towns such as [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Ajlun]], [[Nablus]] and [[al-Karak]] led the caravan with general success.&lt;ref name="Peters148"&gt;Peters,  1994, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EK5MqskDYC0C&amp;pg=PA148  148]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1708, the [[Sublime Porte|Ottoman imperial government]] adopted a new policy whereby the [[List of rulers of Damascus#Ottoman|wali]] (governor) of Damascus would serve as the ''amir al-hajj''.&lt;ref name="Peters148"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burns, 2005, pp. 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt; With this change in policy also came an elevation of the Damascene commander's rank. From then on, his rank was superior to that of the Cairene commander, any imperial Ottoman official traveling with the caravan, the Ottoman governor of the Hejaz in [[Jeddah]], and the Meccan ''sharifs''.&lt;ref name="Peters148"/&gt; The Arab [[al-Azm family]] of Damascus were able to hold on as governors of Damascus for lengthy periods partly due to their success commanding the caravan.&lt;ref name="Masters40"&gt;Masters, ed. Agoston, 2009,  p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&amp;pg=PA40 40]&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the [[Wahhabi]]s [[Emirate of Diriyah|first took control]] of the Hejaz in the early 19th century, they prohibited the carrying of the ''maḥmal'' and the musicians, but when [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] recovered the area in 1811, they were reinstated. When the [[Saudis]] recaptured the Hejaz in 1925, the ban was re-applied.{{sfn|Hathaway|2015}} The exclusivity of the ''amir al-hajj'' office enjoyed by the governors of Damascus ended sometime in the mid-19th century when the Ottomans regained control of Syria from Muhammad Ali's Egyptian forces. The security threat from Bedouin raiders also decreased during that time. From then on, ''amir al-hajj'' became an honorary office typically occupied by a Damascene notable.&lt;ref name="Masters40"/&gt; When the Ottomans lost their nominal authority over Egypt in 1911, the [[Sultan of Egypt]] assigned an ''amir al-hajj'' by decree on a yearly basis, although by then the importance of the office had receded significantly amid radical political changes occurring in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Labib|last=Rizk|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/540/chrncls.htm|title=A Diwan of contemporary life|work=Al-Ahram Weekly|publisher=Al-Ahram|date=2011-07-04|accessdate=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] in [[World War I]] signalled an end to the Damascene ''amir al-hajj''. The dynasty of Muhammad Ali in Egypt continued to appoint an ''amir al-hajj'' for the Cairo caravan until its [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|fall]] in 1952. The office was continued by the new [[Republic of Egypt (1953–58)|republican government]] for two years, before it was finally abolished.{{sfn|Hathaway|2015}}

'''''Atheism: The Case Against God''''' is a 1974 book by [[George H. Smith]], in which the author argues against [[theism]] and for [[atheism]].

==Summary==
Smith describes the purpose of the book as to show that belief in God is irrational:
{{quote|It is not my purpose to convert people to atheism... (but to) demonstrate that the belief in God is irrational to the point of absurdity. If a person wishes to continue believing in a god, that is his prerogative, but he can no longer excuse his belief in the name of reason and moral necessity.}}

==Reception==
The philosopher [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] published a review in April 1982 and stated that it was "a hard hitting attack against belief" with "some limitations".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Martin, [http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/michael_martin/review-smith.html review], Internet Infidels&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bed of nails''' is an [[rectangle|oblong]] piece of wood, the size of a bed, with [[Nail (fastener)|nails]] pointing upwards out of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phun.physics.virginia.edu/demos/nail_bed.html |title=Phun Physics - Demonstrations |publisher=Phun.physics.virginia.edu |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to the spectator that anyone lying on this "bed" would be injured by the nails, but this is not so. Assuming the nails are numerous enough, the weight is distributed among them so that the pressure exerted by each nail is not enough to puncture the person's [[skin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=Tracy V. |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/circus-arts/bed-of-nails.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "Lying on a Bed of Nails" |publisher=Entertainment.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
One use of such a device is for [[magic (illusion)|magic tricks]] or physics demonstrations. A famous example requires a volunteer to lie on a bed of several thousand nails, with a board on top of him. [[Cinder block]]s are placed on the board and then smashed with a [[sledgehammer]]. Despite the seemingly unavoidable force, the volunteer is not harmed: the force from the blow is spread among the thousands of nails, resulting in reduced pressure;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.ucla.edu/demoweb/demomanual/mechanics/first_law_inertia/bed_of_nails.html |title=Bed of Nails |publisher=Physics.ucla.edu |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the breaking of the blocks also dissipates much of the energy from the hammer. This demonstration of the principles of weight distribution requires that the weight of the volunteer be spread over as many nails as possible. The most dangerous part is the moment of lying down or getting up, when one's weight may briefly be supported on only a few nails. Some "beds" have rails mounted at the sides to help users lie down and get up safely.

The bed of nails is used by some for [[meditation]], particularly in Asia, and for certain alleged health benefits, such as back pain relief, see [[acupressure mat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bedofnails.org/About-Bed-of-Nails/default.aspx |title=About Bed of Nails |publisher=Bedofnails.org |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less traditional settings, such as science centers, may use an electronic retractable bed of nails, where the user lies on a flat plastic bed with holes in it, and can then activate the machine to have nails rise up all at once. The nails should retract before getting off the bed. This retraction eliminates the most dangerous part of a traditional bed of nails, getting on and off the bed.

The '''Butkara Stupa''' ({{lang-ur|بت کڑہ اسٹوپا}}) is an important [[Buddhist]] [[stupa]] near [[Mingora]], in the area of [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]], [[Pakistan]]. It may have been built by the [[Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka]], but it is generally dated slightly later to the 2nd century BCE.

The stupa was enlarged on five occasions during the following centuries, every time by building over, and encapsulating, the previous structure.

The stupa was excavated by an Italian mission (IsIOAO: Istuto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente), led by archaeologist Domenico Faccenna from 1956, to clarify the various steps of the construction and enlargements. The mission established that the stupa was "monumentalized" by the addition of Hellenistic architectural decorations during the 2nd century BCE, suggesting a direct involvement of the [[Indo-Greeks]], rulers of northwestern India during that period, in the development of [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;"De l'Indus a l'Oxus: archaeologie de l'Asie Centrale", Pierfrancesco Callieri, p212: "The diffusion, from the second century BCE, of Hellenistic influences in the architecture of Swat is also attested by the archaeological searches at the sanctuary of Butkara I, which saw its stupa "monumentalized" at that exact time by basal elements and decorative alcoves derived from Hellenistic architecture".&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Indo-Corinthian capital]] representing a Buddhist devotee within foliage has been found which had a reliquary and a coins of [[Azes II]] buried at its base, securely dating the sculpture to earlier than 20 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;The Turin City Museum of Ancient Art [http://www.palazzomadamatorino.it/nuovo3/mostre/index.php?lang=2 Text and photographic reference: Terre Lontane &gt; O2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212064946/http://www.palazzomadamatorino.it/nuovo3/mostre/index.php?lang=2 |date=12 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearby Hellenistic fortifications of [[Barikot]] are also thought to be contemporary.

A large quantity of the artifacts are preserved in the [[National Museum of Oriental Art]] and the City Museum of Ancient Art in [[Turin]]'s [[Turin City Museum of Ancient Art]].

==Coinage and datation==
The oldest core strata (GSt 1) revealed a coin of [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and is therefore dated to the Ashokan period.&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;Handbuch der Orientalistik, Kurt A. Behrendt, BRILL, 2004, p.49 sig. [https://books.google.com/books?id=C9_vbgkzUSkC&amp;pg=PA49]&lt;/ref&gt; A coin of [[Menander I]] was found in the second oldest stratum (GSt 2).&lt;ref name="HB"/&gt; A coin of [[Azes II]] was found under a plinth of the third stratum (GSt 3), which is therefore dated to the end of the 1st century BCE or  the beginning of the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="HB"/&gt;  The 4th stratum (GSt 4) contained late coins of Azes II and coins of the Kushan [[Kujula Kadphises]].&lt;ref name="HB"/&gt;

'''David Samuel Margoliouth''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (17 October 1858, [[London]] – 22 March 1940, London) was an English [[oriental studies|orientalist]]. He was  briefly active as a priest in the [[Church of England]]. He was [[Laudian Professor of Arabic]] at the [[University of Oxford]] from 1889 to 1937.&lt;ref name=EB14&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (14th edition) - article ''Margoliouth, David Samuel''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB15&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (15th edition) - article ''Margoliouth, David Samuel''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
His father, Ezekiel, had converted from Judaism to Anglicanism, and thereafter worked in Bethnal Green as a missionary to the Jews; he was also close to his uncle,&lt;ref&gt;Werner Eugen Mosse and [[Julius Carlebach]], ''Second Chance: Two Centuries of German-speaking Jews in the United Kingdom''&lt;/ref&gt; the Anglican convert [[Moses Margoliouth]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt; Margoliouth was educated at [[Winchester College|Winchester]], where he was a scholar, and at [[New College, Oxford]] where he graduated with a double first in Greats and won an unprecedented number of prizes in Classics and Oriental languages, of which he had mastered Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Armenian and Syriac, in addition to Hebrew. His academic dissertation, published in 1888, was entitled ''Analecta Orientalia ad Poeticam Aristoteleam.''  In 1889 he succeeded to the Laudian Chair in Arabic, a position he held until he retired, from ill health, in 1937. He received the degree [[Doctor of Letters]] (D. Litt.) from the New College, Oxford, in July 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University Intelligence |day_of_week=Monday |date=7 July 1900 |page_number=5 |issue=36813| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his works on the history of Islam became the standard treatises in English, including ''Mohammed and the Rise of Islam'' (1905), ''The Early Development of Mohammedanism'' (1914), and ''The Relations Between Arabs and Israelites Prior to the Rise of Islam'' (1924).&lt;ref name=EB15/&gt;

He was described as a brilliant editor and translator of Arabic works,&lt;ref name=EB15/&gt; as seen in ''The Letters of [[Abu'l-'Ala of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man]]'' (1898), ''Yaqut's Dictionary of Learned Men'', 6 vol. (1907–27), and the chronicle of [[Miskawayh]], prepared in collaboration with [[H. F. Amedroz]] under the title ''The Eclipse of the 'Abbasid Caliphate'', 7 vol. (1920–21).
Some of David Samuel Margoliouth's studies are included in ''[[The Origins of The Koran: Classic Essays on Islam’s Holy Book]]'' edited by [[Ibn Warraq]].

He identified a business letter written in the Judeo-Persian language, found in [[Dandan Oilik|Dandan Uiliq]], northwest China, in 1901, as dating from 718 C.E. (the earliest evidence showing the presence of Jews in China).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GAAWkYBNu5sC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=china+jewish+orientalist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SOhKf0ZNkW&amp;sig=FwYyT6ZTZh91PVDbpSJTH-tzNzU&amp;hl=pl&amp;ei=sGNoSsPpGt7RjAfEssGmCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9 Xu Xin, The Jews of Kaifeng, China. History, Culture, and Religion. p.153, KTAV Publishing House, Inc., 2003.] {{ISBN|0-88125-791-5}} {{ISBN|978-0-88125-791-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the council of the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] from 1905 onwards, its director in 1927, was awarded its triennial gold medal in 1928, and was its president 1934-37.&lt;ref name=EB14/&gt;

Egyptian Poet Laureate [[Ahmed Shawqi]] dedicated his famous poem, The Nile, to Margoliouth.

==Margoliouth on the Pre-Islamic Arabic Poetry==

An [http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Polemics/poetry.html article] written in a polemical tone speaks of D.S. Margoliouth's "fabulous conspiracy theor[y]"; an "(in)famous theory" that "the poems we know of as pre-Islamic were actual forgeries of a later Islamic period."

Similarly, the Pakistani Islamic scholar [[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi|Javed Ghamidi]] spoke of "the recent campaign to cast aspersions on the relevance and reliability of the whole corpus of classical Arabic literature of the Jahiliyyah period which began with ‘Usul al-Shu‘ara al-‘Arabi’ by the famous orientalist D.S. Margoliouth ... "&lt;ref&gt;Footnote 17 in an earlier edition of Ghamedi's book ''Meezaan'' at http://www.studying-islam.org/articletext.aspx?id=553 In the 9th Printing (May 2014) of the same book, as well as in the 2nd edition (July 2014) of Ghamidi's English work [http://www.al-mawrid.org/index.php/books/view/islam-a-comprehensive-introduction ''Islam – A Comprehensive Introduction''], this footnote stands omitted.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a look at D.S. Margoliouth's own writings on Pre-Islamic Arabic poetry reveals that his views were not so black and white as has been claimed in, for instance, the above-mentioned examples, but in fact had shades of gray which indicate scholarly caution and reserve in the face of paucity of data.

In his ''Mohammed and the Rise of Islam'' (1st Edition, G. P. Putnam's Sons: New York etc., 1905), Margoliouth wrote: "The language of the Koran was thought by experts to bear a striking likeness to that of the early poetry: and though for us it is difficult to pass an opinion on this point, seeing that the early poetry is largely fabrication modelled on the Koran, we may accept the opinion of the Arabs." (p.&amp;nbsp;60)

In an article in the ''Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics'' (Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1915), Margoliouth writes: "The relation of this Qur'anic style to the verse and rhymed prose of classical Arabic is an enigma which cannot at present be solved." (Vol. VIII, p.&amp;nbsp;874)

{{Muhammad}}
The permissibility of '''depictions of Muhammad''' in [[Islam]] has been a contentious issue. Oral and written descriptions of [[Muhammad]] are readily accepted by all traditions of Islam, but there is disagreement about visual depictions.&lt;ref name=best&gt;{{cite journal

Esposito - 2011 p. 14; for hadith see [[Sahih al-Bukhari]], Hadith: 7.834, 7.838, 7.840, 7.844,  7.846&lt;/ref&gt; It is agreed on all sides that there is no authentic visual tradition as to the appearance of Muhammad, although there are early legends of portraits of him, and written physical descriptions whose authenticity is often accepted.

The question of whether images in [[Islamic art]], including those depicting Muhammad, can be considered as [[religious art]] remains a matter of contention among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.27&lt;/ref&gt; They appear in illustrated books that are normally works of history or poetry, including those with religious subjects; the Quran is never illustrated: "context and intent are essential to understanding Islamic pictorial art. The Muslim artists creating images of Muhammad, and the public who beheld them, understood that the images were not objects of worship. Nor were the objects so decorated used as part of religious worship".&lt;ref&gt;Cosman, Pelner and Jones, Linda Gale. ''Handbook to life in the medieval world'', p. 623, Infobase Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8160-4887-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8160-4887-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, scholars concede that such images have "a spiritual element", and were also sometimes used in informal religious devotions celebrating the day of the [[Mi'raj]].&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.27 (quote) and 43&lt;/ref&gt; Many visual depictions only show Muhammad with his face veiled, or symbolically represent him as a flame; other images, notably from before about 1500, show his face.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), pp. 239, 247–253&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="January2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brendan January|title=The Arab Conquests of the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9XGWkkFy0sC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=1 February 2009|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-0-8225-8744-6|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Safi2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Omid Safi|title=Memories of Muhammad: Why the Prophet Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s63i21E9dr8C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=2 November 2010|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-123135-3|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the notable exception of modern-day Iran,&lt;ref name="GruberHaugbolle2013"/&gt; depictions of Muhammad were rare, never numerous in any community or era throughout Islamic history,&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = Gorgias Press LLC|isbn = 978-1-931956-91-8|last = Arnold|first = Thomas W.|title = Painting in Islam, a Study of the Place of Pictorial Art in Muslim Culture|orig-year = First published in 1928 |date = 2002–2011|pages = 91–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plas1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dirk van der Plas|title=Effigies dei: essays on the history of religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ops3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=14 November 2011|year=1987|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-08655-5|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared almost exclusively in the private medium of Persian and other [[Persian miniature|miniature]] book illustration.&lt;ref name="Ernst2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ernst|first1=Carl W.|authorlink1=Carl W.

Visual images of Muhammad in the non-Islamic West have always been infrequent. In the Middle Ages they were mostly hostile, and most often appear in illustrations of [[Dante]]'s poetry.  In the Renaissance and Early Modern period, Muhammad was sometimes depicted, typically in a more neutral or heroic light. These depictions began to encounter protests from Muslims, and in the age of the internet, a handful of caricature depictions printed in the European press have caused global protests and controversy, and been associated with violence.

==Background==
{{main|Aniconism in Islam}}
In Islam, although nothing in the [[Quran]] explicitly bans images, some supplemental [[hadith]] explicitly ban the drawing of images of any living creature; other hadith tolerate images, but never encourage them. Hence, most Muslims avoid visual depictions of Muhammad or [[Prophets of Islam|any other prophet]] such as [[Moses]] or [[Abraham]].&lt;ref name=best/&gt;&lt;ref name=USSC&gt;{{cite web|url={{SCOTUS URL|about/north&amp;southwalls.pdf}} |format=PDF|title=Courtroom Friezes: North and South Walls|author=Office of the Curator|date=2003-05-08|accessdate=2007-07-08|work=Information Sheet, Supreme Court of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=explaining&gt;{{cite news|title=Explaining the outrage|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-02-08/news/0602080383_1_prophet-muhammad-cartoons-muslims|date=2006-02-08|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some major religions have experienced times during their history when [[aniconism|images of their religious figures were forbidden]]. In Judaism, one of the [[Ten Commandments]] forbids "graven images".  In [[Byzantine]] Christianity during the periods of [[byzantine iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] in the 8th century, and again during the 9th century, visual representations of sacred figures were forbidden, and only the [[Christian cross|Cross]] could be depicted in churches. The visual representation of Jesus and other religious figures remains a concern in parts of [[Protestant Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Halicks&gt;{{cite news|title=Images of Muhammad: Three ways to see a cartoon|author=Richard Halicks|date=2006-02-12|work=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portraiture of Muhammad in Islamic literature==

A number of ''hadith'' and other writings of the early Islamic period include stories in which portraits of Muhammad appear. [[Abu Hanifa Dinawari]], [[Ibn al-Faqih]], [[Ibn Wahshiyya]] and [[Abu Nu`aym]] tell versions of a story in which the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] is visited by two Meccans. He shows them a cabinet, handed down to him from [[Alexander the Great]] and originally created by God for Adam, each of whose drawers contains a portrait of a prophet. They are astonished to see a portrait of Muhammad in the final drawer. [[Sadid al-Din al-Kazaruni]] tells a similar story in which the Meccans are visiting the king of China. [[Kisa'i]] tells that God did indeed give portraits of the prophets to Adam.&lt;ref name=Grabar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grabar|first=Oleg|title=The Story of Portraits of the Prophet Muhammad|journal=Studia Islamica|year=2003|issue=96|pages=19–38|jstor=1596240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Wahshiyya and Abu Nu'ayn tell a second story in which a Meccan merchant visiting Syria is invited to a Christian monastery where a number of sculptures and paintings depict prophets and saints. There he sees the images of Muhammad and Abu Bakr, as yet unidentified by the Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asani|first=Ali|title=Celebrating Muhammad: Images of the Prophet in Popular Muslim Piety|year=1995|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, SC|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an 11th-century story, Muhammad is said so have sat for a portrait by an artist retained by [[Sassanid]] king [[Kavadh II]]. The king liked the portrait so much that he placed it on his pillow.&lt;ref name=Grabar/&gt;

Later, [[Al-Maqrizi]] tells a story in which [[Muqawqis]], ruler of Egypt, meets with Muhammad's envoy. He asks the envoy to describe Muhammad and checks the description against a portrait of an unknown prophet which he has on a piece of cloth. The description matches the portrait.&lt;ref name=Grabar/&gt;

In a 17th-century [[Islam in China|Chinese]] story, the king of China asks to see Muhammad, but Muhammad instead sends his portrait. The king is so enamoured of the portrait that he is converted to Islam, at which point the portrait, having done its job, disappears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leslie|first=Donald|title=Islam in Traditional China|year=1986|publisher=Canberra College of Advanced Education|location=Canberra|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal descriptions===
{{main|Shama'il Muhammadiyah|Hilya}}
[[File:Hilye-i serif 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[hilya|Hilye]]'' by [[Hâfiz Osman]] (1642–1698)]]
In one of the earliest sources, [[Ibn Sa'd]]'s ''Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir'', there are numerous verbal descriptions of Muhammad. One description sourced to [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] is as follows:

: ''The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, is neither too short nor too tall. His hair are neither curly nor straight, but a mixture of the two. He is a man of black hair and large skull. His complexion has a tinge of redness. His shoulder bones are broad and his palms and feet are fleshy. He has long ''al-masrubah'' which means hair growing from neck to navel. He is of long eye-lashes, close eyebrows, smooth and shining fore-head and long space between two shoulders. When he walks he walks inclining as if coming down from a height. [...] I never saw a man like him before him or after him.''&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Sa'd – ''Kitabh al-Tabaqat al-Kabir'', as translated by S. Moinul and H.K. Ghazanfar, Kitab Bhavan, New Delhi, n.d.{{unreliable source?|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period onwards such texts have been presented on calligraphic ''[[hilya]]'' panels (Turkish: ''hilye'', pl. ''hilyeler''), commonly surrounded by an elaborate frame of [[Ottoman illumination|illuminated decoration]] and either included in books or, more often, [[muraqqa]]s or albums, or sometimes placed in wooden frames so that they can hang on a wall.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), p.231-232&lt;/ref&gt;  The elaborated form of the calligraphic tradition was founded in the 17th century by the Ottoman calligrapher [[Hâfiz Osman]]. While containing a concrete and artistically appealing description of Muhammad's appearance, they complied with the strictures against figurative depictions of Muhammad, leaving his appearance to the viewer's imagination.  Several parts of the complex design were named after parts of the body, from the head downwards, indicating the explicit intention of the hilya as a substitute for a figurative depiction.&lt;ref name="Peters2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=F. E. Peters|title=Jesus and Muhammad: Parallel Tracks, Parallel Lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olEi-1LZYYQC&amp;pg=PA160|accessdate=5 November 2011|date=10 November 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-974746-7|pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockopp2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan E.

The Ottoman ''hilye'' format customarily starts with a [[basmala]], shown on top, and is separated in the middle by {{cite quran|21|107|style=ref}}: "And We have not sent you but as a mercy to the worlds".&lt;ref name="Brockopp2010" /&gt; Four compartments set around the central one often contain the names of the [[Rashidun|Rightly-Guided Caliphs]], [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], [[Uthman]], and [[Ali]], each followed by "radhi Allahu anhu" ("may God be pleased with him").

&lt;/div&gt;

===Calligraphic representations===
The most common visual representation of the Muhammad in Islamic art, especially in Arabic-speaking areas, is by a calligraphic representation of his name, a sort of [[monogram]] in roughly circular form, often given a decorated frame. Such inscriptions are normally in Arabic, and may rearrange or repeat forms, or add a blessing or honorific, or for example the word "messenger" or a contraction of it.  The range of ways of representing Muhammad's name is considerable, including [[ambigram]]s; he is also frequently symbolised by a rose.

The more elaborate versions relate to other Islamic traditions of special forms of calligraphy such as those writing the [[Names of God in Islam|names of God]], and the secular [[tughra]] or elaborate monogram of Ottoman rulers.

===Figurative visual depictions===
[[File:Medieval Persian manuscript Muhammad leads Abraham Moses Jesus.jpg|thumb|Muhammad leads [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]] and others in prayer. Persian miniature]]
Throughout Islamic history, depictions of Muhammad in Islamic art were rare.&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; Even so, there exists a "notable corpus of images of Muhammad produced, mostly in the form of manuscript illustrations, in various regions of the Islamic world from the thirteenth century through modern times".&lt;ref name="Gruber 2005, p. 240-241"&gt;Gruber (2005), p. 240-241&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions of Muhammad date back to the start of the tradition of [[Persian miniature]]s as illustrations in books. The illustrated book from the [[Persianate]] world (''Warka and Gulshah'', [[Topkapi Palace]] Library H. 841, attributed to [[Konya]] 1200–1250) contains the two earliest known Islamic depictions of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, p. 19; Gruber (2005), p. 235 (from where the date range), Blair, Sheila S., ''The Development of the Illustrated Book in Iran'', ''Muqarnas'', Vol. 10, Essays in Honor of Oleg Grabar (1993), p. 266, BRILL, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1523191 JSTOR] says "c. 1250"&lt;/ref&gt;

This book dates to before or just around the time of the [[Mongol invasion]] of [[Anatolia]] in the 1240s, and before the campaigns against Persia and Iraq of the 1250s, which destroyed great numbers of books in libraries. Recent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, generally human figurative art was a continuous tradition in Islamic lands (such as in literature, science, and history); as early as the 8th century, such art flourished during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (c. 749 - 1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Bloom  |author2=S. Blair |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=192 and 207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;lpg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq=cairo+egypt+miniature+paintings+mamluk#v=onepage&amp;q=cairo%20egypt%20miniature%20paintings%20mamluk&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christiane Gruber traces a development from "veristic" images showing the whole body and face, in the 13th to 15th centuries, to more "abstract" representations in the 16th to 19th centuries, the latter including the representation of Muhammad by a special type of [[calligraphic]] representation, with the older types also remaining in use.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), 229, and throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  An intermediate type, first found from about 1400, is the "inscribed portrait" where the face of Muhammad is blank, with "Ya Muhammad" ("O Muhammad") or a similar phrase written in the space instead; these may be related to [[Sufi]] thought.  In some cases the inscription appears to have been an underpainting that would later be covered by a face or veil, so a pious act by the painter, for his eyes alone, but in others it was intended to be seen.&lt;ref name="Gruber 2005, p. 240-241"/&gt; According to Gruber, a good number of these paintings later underwent [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] mutilations, in which the facial features of Muhammad were scratched or smeared, as Muslim views on the acceptability of veristic images changed.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), 229&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of extant Persian manuscripts representing Muhammad date from the [[Ilkhanid]] period under the new [[Mongol]] rulers, including a ''[[Marzubannama]]'' dating to 1299. The Ilkhanid [[MS Arab 161]] of 1307/8 contains 25 illustrations found in an illustrated version of [[Al-Biruni]]'s ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]'', of which five include depictions Muhammad, including the two concluding images, the largest and most accomplished in the manuscript, which emphasize the relation of Muhammad and [[`Ali]] according to [[Shi`ite]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), pp.27-28&lt;/ref&gt; According to Christiane Gruber, other works use images to promote [[Sunni]] Islam, such as a set of Mi'raj illustrations (MS H 2154) in the early 14th century,&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), quote p. 43; generally pp.29-45&lt;/ref&gt; although other historians have dated the same illustrations to the [[Jalayrid]] period of Shia rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Tauris Academic Studies| isbn = 1-84511-499-X| last = Gruber| first = Christiane| title = The Ilkhanid Book of Ascension| date = 2010-03-15| page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siyer-i Nebi 158b.jpg|thumb|upright|Muhammad, shown with a veiled face and halo, at [[Mount Hira]] (16th-century Ottoman illustration of the [[Siyer-i Nebi]])]]
Depictions of Muhammad are also found in Persian manuscripts in the following [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] dynasties, and Turkish [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] art in the 14th to 17th centuries, and beyond. Perhaps the most elaborate cycle of illustrations of Muhammad's life is the copy, completed in 1595, of the 14th-century biography ''[[Siyer-i Nebi]]'' commissioned by the Ottoman sultan [[Murat III]] for his son, the future [[Mehmed III]], containing over 800 illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Hürriyet Vakfı Yayınları| last = Tanındı| first = Zeren| title = Siyer-i nebî: İslam tasvir sanatında Hz. Muhammedʹin hayatı| year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the commonest narrative scene represented is the [[Mi'raj]]; according to Gruber, "There exist countless single-page paintings of the meʿrāj included in the beginnings of Persian and Turkish romances and epic stories produced from the beginning of the 15th century to the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (Iranica)&lt;/ref&gt;  These images were also used in celebrations of the anniversary of the Mi'raj on 27 [[Rajab]], when the accounts were recited aloud to male groups: "Didactic and engaging, oral stories of the ascension seem to have had the religious goal of inducing attitudes of praise among their audiences".  Such practices are most easily documented in the 18th and 19th centuries, but manuscripts from much earlier appear to have fulfilled the same function.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.43&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise a large number of different scenes may be represented at times, from Muhammad's birth to the end of his life, and his existence in Paradise.&lt;ref&gt;The birth is rare, but appears in an early manuscript in Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Halo ====
In the earliest depictions Muhammad may be shown with or without a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], the earliest halos being round in the style of Christian art,&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, 95&lt;/ref&gt; but before long a flaming halo or [[aureole]] in the [[Buddhist]] or Chinese tradition becomes more common than the circular form found in the West, when a halo is used.  A halo or flame may surround only his head, but often his whole body, and in some images the body itself cannot be seen for the halo.  This "luminous" form of representation avoided the issues caused by "veristic" images, and could be taken to convey qualities of Muhammad's person described in texts.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, 230, 236&lt;/ref&gt;  If the body is visible, the face may be covered with a veil (see gallery for examples of both types). This form of representation, which began at the start of the [[Safavid]] period in Persia,&lt;ref&gt;Brend, Barbara. ''Islamic Art'', p. 161, British Museum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was done out of reverence and respect.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; Other [[prophets of Islam]], and Muhammad's wives and relations, may be treated in similar ways if they also appear.

[[Thomas Walker Arnold|T. W. Arnold]] (1864–1930), an early historian of Islamic art, stated that "Islam has never welcomed painting as a handmaid of religion as both Buddhism and Christianity have done. Mosques have never been decorated with religious pictures, nor has a pictorial art been employed for the instruction of the heathen or for the edification of the faithful."&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; Comparing Islam to Christianity, he also writes: "Accordingly, there has never been any historical tradition in the religious painting of Islam – no artistic development in the representation of accepted types – no schools of painters of religious subjects; least of all has there been any guidance on the part of leaders of religious thought corresponding to that of ecclesiastical authorities in the Christian Church."&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt;

Images of Muhammad remain controversial to the present day, and are not considered acceptable in many countries in the Middle East.  For example, in 1963 an account by a Turkish author of a [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] was banned in [[Pakistan]] because it contained reproductions of miniatures showing Muhammad unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie, ''Deciphering the signs of God: a phenomenological approach to Islam'', p.45, n. 86, SUNY Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7914-1982-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1982-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary Iran===
[[File:760 - Jeune arabe.jpg|thumb|upright|A colourised version of the original photograph by [[Lehnert &amp; Landrock (disambiguation)|Lehnert &amp; Landrock]], which later became the base of an Iranian depiction of a young Muhammad.]]
Despite the ban on the representation of Muhammad, images of Muhammed are not uncommon in Iran. The Iranian Shi'ism seems more tolerant on this point than Sunnite orthodoxy.&lt;ref name="etudes"/&gt; In Iran, depictions have considerable acceptance to the present day, and may be found in the modern forms of the poster and [[postcard]].&lt;ref name="GruberHaugbolle2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.253, illustrates a postcard bought in 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s, experts in Islamic iconography discovered images, printed on paper in Iran, portraying Mohammed as a teenager wearing a turban.&lt;ref name="etudes"/&gt; There are several variants, all show the same juvenile face, identified by an inscription such as "Muhammad, the Messenger of God", or a more detailed legend referring to an episode in the life of Muhammad and the supposed origin of the image.&lt;ref name="etudes"/&gt; Some Iranian versions of these posters attributed the original depiction to a [[Bahira]], a Christian monk who met the young Muhammad in Syria. By crediting the image to a Christian and predating it to the time before Muhammad became a prophet, the manufacturers of the image exonerate themselves from any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="iconic"/&gt;

The motif was taken from a photograph of a young Tunisian taken by the Germans [[Rudolf Franz Lehnert]] and [[Ernst Heinrich Landrock]] in 1905 or 1906, which had been printed in high editions on picture post cards till 1921.&lt;ref name="etudes"&gt;Pierre Centlivres, Micheline Centlivres-Demont: [http://etudesphotographiques.revues.org/index747.html Une étrange rencontre.

===Cinema===
{{main|List of films about Muhammad|Depictions of Muhammad in film}}
Very few films have been made about Muhammad.  The 1976 film ''The Message'', also known as ''[[Mohammad, Messenger of God]]'', focused on other persons and never directly showed Muhammad or most members of his family.  A devotional cartoon called ''[[Muhammad: The Last Prophet]]'' was released in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finemediagroup.com/user/finemedia/press.cfm|title=Fine Media Group|accessdate=2006-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Iranian film directed by Majid Majidi was released in 2015 named ''[[Muhammad (2015 film)|Muhammad]]''. It is the first part of the trilogy film series on Muhammad by Majid Majidi.

While [[Sunni]] Muslims have always explicitly prohibited the depiction of Muhammad on film,&lt;ref name=fatwa_important&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alessandra. Raengo  |author2=Robert Stam  |lastauthoramp=yes |title = A Companion To Literature And Film |publisher = Blackwell Publishing |year = 2004|isbn=0-631-23053-X |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; contemporary [[Shi'a]] scholars have taken a more relaxed attitude, stating that it is permissible to depict Muhammad, even in television or movies, if done with respect.&lt;ref name=sistani&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sistani.org/html/eng/menu/4/?lang=eng&amp;view=d&amp;code=234&amp;page=1 |title=Istifta |accessdate=2006-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017223013/http://www.sistani.org/html/eng/menu/4/?lang=eng&amp;view=d&amp;code=234&amp;page=1 |archivedate=2006-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction by non-Muslims==
{{Commons category|Western depictions of Muhammad}}
Western representations of Muhammad were very rare until the explosion of images following the invention of the [[printing press]]; he is shown in a few medieval images, normally in an unflattering manner, often influenced by his brief mention in [[Dante|Dante's]] ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.  Muhammad sometimes figures in Western depictions of groups of influential people in world history. Such depictions tend to be favourable or neutral in intent; one example can be found at the [[United States Supreme Court building#Sculptural program|United States Supreme Court building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Created in 1935, the frieze includes major historical lawgivers, and places Muhammad alongside [[Hammurabi]], [[Moses]], [[Confucius]], and others. In 1997, a controversy erupted surrounding the frieze, and tourist materials have since been edited to describe the depiction as "a well-intentioned attempt by the sculptor to honor Muhammad" that "bears no resemblance to Muhammad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrepublican.com/sup_crt_frieze.html|title=The Daily Republican: Supreme Court Frieze|accessdate=2006-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, a statue of Muhammad was removed from a courthouse in New York City after the ambassadors of [[Indonesia]], Pakistan, and [[Egypt]] requested its removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourmailinglistprovider.com/pubarchive_show_message.php?montrealmuslimnews+7289|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130210055800/http://www.yourmailinglistprovider.com/pubarchive_show_message.php?montrealmuslimnews+7289|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-02-10|accessdate=2006-03-10|date=2006-02-12|title=Archive "Montreal News Network": Images of Muhammad, Gone for Good}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extremely rare representations of Muhammad in [[monumental sculpture]] are especially likely to be offensive to Muslims, as the statue is the classic form for idols, and a fear of any hint of idolatry is the basis of Islamic prohibitions. Islamic art has almost always avoided large sculptures of any subject, especially free-standing ones; only a few animals are known, mostly fountain-heads, like those in the Lion Court of the [[Alhambra]]; the [[Pisa Griffin]] is perhaps the largest.

In 1997, the [[Council on American–Islamic Relations]], a Muslim advocacy group in the United States, wrote to United States Supreme Court Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] requesting that the sculpted representation of [[Muhammad]] on the north frieze inside the Supreme Court building be removed or sanded down. The court rejected CAIR's request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/other/how-the-%e2%80%9cban%e2%80%9d-on-images-of-muhammad-came-to-be/ar-AA8lQj0 MSN : "How the “Ban” on Images of Muhammad Came to Be" by Jackie Bischof]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526045614/http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/other/how-the-%E2%80%9Cban%E2%80%9D-on-images-of-muhammad-came-to-be/ar-AA8lQj0 |date=May 26, 2015 }} January 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been numerous book illustrations showing Muhammad.

[[Dante]], in ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|The Divine Comedy: Inferno]]'', placed Muhammad in Hell, with his entrails hanging out (Canto 28):

:No barrel, not even one where the hoops and staves go every which way, was ever split open like one frayed Sinner I saw, ripped from chin to where we fart&lt;!-- this is the actual quotation; do not remove--&gt; below.
:His guts hung between his legs and displayed His vital organs, including that wretched sack Which converts to shit&lt;!-- this is the actual quotation; do not remove --&gt; whatever gets conveyed down the gullet.
:As I stared at him he looked back And with his hands pulled his chest open, Saying, ''"See how I split open the crack in myself! See how twisted and broken Mohammed is! Before me walks [[Ali]], his face Cleft from chin to crown, grief–stricken."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seth Zimmerman|title=The Inferno of Dante Alighieri |page=191 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3hWDEjN7JcC&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2003 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=0-595-28090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This scene was sometimes shown in illustrations of the ''[[The Divine Comedy|Divina Commedia]]'' before modern times. Muhammad is represented in a 15th-century [[fresco]] ''[[Last Judgement]]'' by [[Giovanni da Modena]] and drawing on Dante, in the [[Church of San Petronio]], [[Bologna, Italy]].&lt;ref name=fresco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,11711,742914,00.html|title=Al-Qaida plot to blow up Bologna church fresco|date=2002-06-24|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Philip Willan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and artwork by [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[William Blake]], and [[Gustave Doré]].&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/02/11/MNGRCH6UQK1.DTL|title=What's behind Muslim cartoon outrage|date=2006-02-11|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Ayesha Akram}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies in the 21st century==
The start of the 21st century has been marked by controversies over depictions of Muhammad, not only for recent caricatures or cartoons, but also regarding the display of historical artwork.

[[File:Mohammeds Berufung, Hosemann 1847.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Die Berufung Mohammeds durch den Engel Gabriel'' by [[Theodor Hosemann]], 1847, published by ''Spiegel'' in 1999]]
In a story on morals at the end of the millennium in December 1999, the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' printed on the same page pictures of “moral apostles” Muhammad, [[Jesus]], [[Confucius]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]. In the subsequent weeks, the magazine received protests, petitions and threats against publishing the picture of Muhammad. The Turkish TV-station [[Show TV]] broadcast the telephone number of an editor who then received daily calls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-15613871.html Terror am Telefon], ''Spiegel'', February 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadeem Elyas, leader of the [[Central Council of Muslims in Germany]] said that the picture should not be printed again in order to avoid hurting the feelings of Muslims intentionally. Elyas recommended to whiten the face of Muhammad instead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carolin Emcke]]: [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-15613870.html Fanatiker sind leicht verführbar], Interview with Nadeem Elyas, February 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2001, the ''Spiegel'' with consideration of Islamic laws published a picture of Muhammed with a whitened face on its title page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45774322.html, 6. Februar 2006 Betr.: Titel], ''Spiegel'', 6 February 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The same picture of Muhammad by Hosemann had been published by the magazine once before in 1998 in a special edition on Islam, but then without evoking similar protests.&lt;ref&gt;''Spiegel Special'' 1, 1998, page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Italian police reported that they had disrupted a terrorist plot to destroy a church in [[Bologna]], which contains a 15th-century [[fresco]] depicting an image of Muhammad (see above).&lt;ref name=fresco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2D9163CF931A1575BC0A9649C8B63|title=Italy frees Fresco Suspects|date=2002-08-22|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of depictions of Muhammad being altered include a 1940 mural at the [[University of Utah]] having the name of Muhammad removed from beneath the painting in 2000 at the request of Muslim students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muhammad depiction controversy lurks in U’s past|url=http://archive.dailyutahchronicle.com/2006/02/22/muhammad-depiction-controversy-lurks-in-us-past/|work=Daily Utah Chronicle|agency=University of Utah|date=22 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Danish newspaper ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' published a set of [[editorial cartoons]], many of which depicted Muhammad. In late 2005 and early 2006, Danish Muslim organizations ignited a [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|controversy]] through public protests and by spreading knowledge of the publication of the cartoons.&lt;ref name=Halicks/&gt; According to John Woods, Islamic history professor at the University of Chicago, it was not simply the depiction of Muhammad that was offensive, but the implication that Muhammad was somehow a supporter of terrorism.&lt;ref name=explaining/&gt; In Sweden, an online caricature competition was announced in support of ''Jyllands-Posten'', but Foreign Affairs Minister [[Laila Freivalds]] and the [[Swedish Security Service]] pressured the [[internet service provider]] to shut the page down.

[[File:South park muhammad.jpg|thumb|Muhammad appeared in the 2001 ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Super Best Friends]]". The image was later removed from the 2006 episode "[[Cartoon Wars Part II|Cartoon Wars]]" and the 2010 episodes "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" due to controversies regarding Muhammad cartoons in European newspapers.]]
In 2006, the controversial American [[animated]] television comedy program ''[[South Park]]'', which had previously depicted Muhammad as a [[superhero]] character in the July 4, 2001 episode "[[Super Best Friends]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Super Best Friends | episodelink = Super Best Friends | series = South Park | serieslink = South Park | airdate = 2001-07-04 | season = 5 | number = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has depicted Muhammad in the opening sequence since that episode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/04/15/south-parks-been-showing-muhammad-all-season/ |title=Ryan j Budke.

In the episode, "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]", they intended to show Muhammad handing a salmon helmet to [[Peter Griffin]], a character from the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated series ''[[Family Guy]]''. However, [[Comedy Central]], who airs ''South Park'', rejected the scene, citing concerns of violent protests in the [[Islamic world]]. The creators of ''South Park'' reacted by instead satirizing Comedy Central's [[double standard]] for broadcast acceptability by including a segment of "Cartoon Wars Part II" in which [[President of the United States|American president]] [[George W. Bush]] and [[Jesus]] defecate on the [[flag of the United States]].

The [[Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy]] began in July 2007 with a series of drawings by [[Sweden|Swedish]] artist [[Lars Vilks]] which depicted Muhammad as a [[roundabout dog]]. Several art galleries in Sweden declined to show the drawings, citing security concerns and fear of violence. The controversy gained international attention after the [[Örebro]]-based regional newspaper ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'' published one of the drawings on August 18 to illustrate an [[editorial]] on [[self-censorship]] and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=Rätten att förlöjliga en religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-18 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070906190721/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-06}}&lt;br/&gt;English translation: {{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=The right to ridicule a religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830163657/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversy emerged in September 2007 when [[Bangladesh]]i cartoonist [[Arifur Rahman]] was detained on suspicion of showing disrespect to Muhammad.  The interim government confiscated copies of the [[Bengali language|Bengali]]-language ''[[Prothom Alo]]'' in which the drawings appeared. The cartoon consisted of a boy holding a cat conversing with an elderly man.  The man asks the boy his name, and he replies "Babu". The older man chides him for not mentioning the name of Muhammad before his name.

He then points to the cat and asks the boy what it is called, and the boy replies "Muhammad the cat". The cartoon caused a firestorm in Bangladesh, with militant [[Islamists]] demanding that Rahman be executed for [[blasphemy]]. A group of people [[book burning|torched copies of the paper]] and several Islamic groups protested, saying the drawings ridiculed Mohammad and his companions. They demanded "exemplary punishment" for the paper's editor and the cartoonist. Bangladesh does not have a [[blasphemy law]], although one had been demanded by the same extremist Islamic groups.

On November 2, 2010, the office of the French satirical weekly newspaper ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' at Paris was attacked with a firebomb and its website hacked, after it had announced plans to publish a special edition with Muhammad as its “chief editor”, and the title page with a cartoon of Muhammad had been pre-issued on social media.

In 2008, several Muslims protested against the inclusion of Muhammad's depictions in the [[English Wikipedia]]'s ''Muhammad'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,328966,00.html |title=Muslims Protest Wikipedia Images of Muhammad |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2008-02-06 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/books/05wiki.html |title=Wikipedia Islam Entry Is Criticized |author=Noam Cohen |work=The New York Times|date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maome.jpg|thumb|left|The petition was opposed to a depiction of Muhammad prohibiting [[Nasīʾ]].]]
The petition opposed a reproduction of a 17th-century Ottoman copy of a 14th-century [[Ilkhanate]] manuscript image ([[MS Arabe 1489]]) depicting Muhammad as he prohibited [[Nasīʾ]].&lt;ref&gt;MS Arabe 1489. The image used by Wikipedia is hosted on [[Wikimedia Commons]] ([//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Maome.jpg upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Maome.jpg]). The reproduction originates from the website of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] [http://expositions.bnf.fr/livrarab/pedago/grands/0_01.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Henzell-Thomas of ''The American Muslim'' deplored the petition as one of "these mechanical knee-jerk reactions [which] are gifts to those who seek every opportunity to decry Islam and ridicule Muslims and can only exacerbate a situation in which Muslims and the Western media seem to be locked in an ever-descending spiral of ignorance and mutual loathing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theamericanmuslim.org/tam.php/features/articles/wikipedia_and_depictions_of_the_prophet_muhammad_the_latest_inane_distracti/0015659 Wikipedia and Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad: The Latest Inane Distraction], 10 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metropolitan Museum of Art===
The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in January 2010 confirmed to the ''[[New York Post]]'' that it had quietly removed all historic paintings which contained depictions of Muhammad from public exhibition. The Museum quoted objections on the part of conservative Muslims which were "under review."  The museum's action was criticized as excessive [[political correctness]], as were other decisions taken close to the same time, including the renaming of the "Primitive Art Galleries" to the "Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas" and the projected "Islamic Galleries" to "Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia and Later South Asia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/jihad_jitters_at_met_76yj3VNUy4hcRAnhOcPCHP 'Jihad' jitters at Met – Mohammed art gone] by Isabel Vincent, 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everybody Draw Mohammed Day===
{{main|Everybody Draw Mohammed Day}}
Everybody Draw Mohammed Day was a protest against those who threatened violence against artists who drew representations of Muhammad. It began as a protest against the action of [[Comedy Central]] in forbidding the broadcast of the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" in response to [[death threat]]s against some of those responsible for the segment. Observance of the day began with a drawing posted on the [[Internet]] on April 20, 2010, accompanied by text suggesting that "everybody" create a drawing representing Muhammad, on May 20, 2010, as a protest against efforts to limit [[freedom of speech]].

===Muhammad Art Exhibit &amp; Contest===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6576">[[Image:UUA Districts.gif|thumb|right|550px|A map of all 19 [[UUA]] districts.]]The [[Unitarian Universalist Association]], an association of [[Unitarian Universalist]] [[Wiktionary:congregation|Congregations]] in the [[United States of America]], is composed of 19 '''Districts.'''

==Structure==

Each District has its own District-level organization, complete with governing body (in the form of an elected council, or board) and all. Districts provide services to their member congregations, including help with ministerial settlement. Each District has a representative on the UUA's Board of Trustees. Collaborations between districts have also resulted in the creation of five unofficial "regions": the Central East Regional Group, the Southern Region, MidAmerica Region, Pacific Western Region and New England Region. Multi-congregational collaboration within districts has also resulted in the creation of unofficial local "clusters" or "networks" (similar to [[deanery|deaneries]] in [[episcopal polity|episcopal polities]]) within metropolitan areas with closely approximate churches. Districts also hold annual district assemblies similar to the [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|General Assembly]], in which workshops and district business is performed.

==District list==

* NOTE: Until 2008, there were 20 Districts; the Northeast and New Hampshire-Vermont Districts merged to become the Northern New England District.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4621">The '''Festival of Santa Esterica''' is a [[holiday]] that was created as a substitute for [[Purim]] by the [[Anusim]] (also known as "[[conversos]]", [[Sephardi Jews]] forced to convert to [[Catholicism]]) after their [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion from Spain]] in the late 15th century. It is still celebrated today in the [[Latin America]] and [[Southwestern United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/queen-esther-patron-saint-of-crypto-jews/ Queen Esther: Patron saint of crypto-Jews]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crypto-Judaism|conversos who wanted to maintain their identity as Jews]] fled to [[Portugal]], yet they had to face another religiously based [[persecution of Jews and Muslims by Manuel I of Portugal]] and expulsion in 1497, this was what brought them and the festival to the [[New World]].

The festival was themed about a fictional [[saint]] called "Esterica" who was heavily based upon Queen [[Esther]]. During the festival the [[New Christian]] women fasted for 3 days as Esther herself, her uncle [[Mordechai]] and the [[Persian Jews|Jews of Persia]] did in the [[Book of Esther]] prior to her meeting with King [[Achashverosh]].

Although it was dangerous for the conversos to celebrate this festival due to its [[Jewish]] elements, as the [[Inquisition]] demanded no traits of their former religion be preserved, there are documents from Mexico that confirm the Festival of Esterica was held in Mexico as well. According to [[historian]] [[Janet L. Jacobs|Janet Liebman Jacobs]], converso women used to light candles and cook a [[kosher]] [[banquet]] with their daughters - which helped passing out knowledge of the traditional [[Jewish cuisine]] to the next generations.{{Refn|“Women, Ritual, and Secrecy: The Creation of the Crypto-Jewish Culture,” Janet Liebman Jacobs}} The public festival celebrations had became private events that was celebrated with the family indoors. The conversos had also started to honor Esther with [[iconographic]] art pieces they made in her image and held in their households.

In 1643 a conversos' descendant named Gabriel de Grande from Mexico confessed that the women of his family had divided the three days of fasting between them so each will only fast for one day. The [[Mexican Inquisition]] had been alerted of that and him and his family were [[Death by burning|burnt alive on the stake]] for [[Judaizing]].

[[Moshe Orfali]] claims in his book ''The Fast of Esther in the Lore of the Marranos'' that the conversos lived with the non-stopping feeling of [[sin]] since they had to act like Christians towards the outside world while deep inside were Jewish, and that the fast helped them to feel as they were making up for their sin to [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/tetzaveh/orf.html "The Fast of Esther in the Lore of the Marranos" - Prof. Moshe Orfali; Dept. of Jewish History]&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of the Festival of Santa Esterica had begun to decrease between the years 1964 to 1974 following the statements of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] [[Archbishop]], Peter Davis, who studied the festival and had begun preaching to [[Hispanics]] who did celebrate it that they're actually practicing a Jewish holiday based on Purim and that there was no such saint called Esterica. As a result of that it is less common to find iconographic Esterica art pieces at Southwestern United States houses today in comparison to the 20th century and prior to that.

According to ''The Book of Esther in Modern Research'' by [[Leonard Greenspoon]] and [[Sidnie White Crawford]], in the iconographic Esterica pieces that were common in the [[Americas]] the saint was depicted wearing a [[Crown (headgear)|Crown]] on her head and holding a hanging [[rope]]. They interpret these motifs as signs of [[Judaism]] being grasped as something royal that comes with the risk of getting caught by the Christians and end the conversos' lives in [[hanging]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books/about/The_Book_of_Esther_in_Modern_Research.html?id=VtXYAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y The Book of Esther in Modern Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New Mexico]], the art that decorated the conversos' houses with Santa Esterica were portrayed with [[red]] [[curtains]] that frame the icona.

The '''Gandharv''' (sometimes pronounced '''Gandharb''') are a [[Hindu]] community found in [[North India]].&lt;ref name='Hasan'&gt;''People of India Uttar Pradesh, Volume XLII ,Part Two'' edited by A. Hasan &amp; J. C. Das, pages 494 to 497. Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt; Some Gandharvs are also [[Jats|Jat People]].

== Origin ==
The Gandharv are an ancient community, frequently mentioned in ancient [[Sanskrit]] texts as a group associated with singing and dancing to entertain the gods. They are divided into seven exogamous clans, known as [[gotra]]s. These seven clans are the Arakh, Sital, Ramsi, Shahimal, Hiwan, Panchbhaiya, and Dhomana. The Gandharv are found mainly in the [[Hindu]] holy cities of [[Allahabad]] and [[Varanasi]]. They speak both standard [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and the [[Bhojpuri]] dialect.&lt;ref name="Hasan"/&gt; Traditionally, the Gandharv were a community of singers and musicians, who were often employed by [[nautch]] girls. Half of the fees were given to the Gandharv. They have a seen a decline in their traditional occupation, and many are now landless agricultural labourers.

'''''God is Back: How the Global Revival of Faith Is Changing the World''''' is a 2009 book by [[John Micklethwait]] and [[Adrian Wooldridge]] which argues against the [[secularization]] thesis and claims that there is a global revival of faith has started in the late twentieth century.

Micklethwait and Wooldridge provided a quick coverage of American history, in which they argue that American religion was dramatically transformed by the [[disestablishment]] of churches after the [[American Revolution]].  An emerging "[[marketplace of ideas|free market]]" of religious choices led Americans to become increasingly pluralistic and tolerant of other forms of Christianity.  The voluntary nature of religious association led Americans to take ownership of their own institutions and churches, helping create a democratic sense of responsibility for creating associations and community.  These features of American culture, along with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment's]] separation of church and state, ensured that American religions could only survive by appealing to the common people.  This democratized American Christianity, leading average Americans to shape religious movements themselves.  In the post-Revolutionary period, all this led America in an increasingly pluralist and democratic direction.&lt;ref name=gib&gt;John Micklethwait and Arian Wooldridge, ''God is Back: How the Global Revival of Faith is Changing the World'' (New York: Penguin Press, 2009), 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue that the religions growing around the world tend to exhibit these same features.  World religions—and Christianity, in particular—are growing fastest where they are: competing with other religious alternatives, unsupported by state governments, and entirely dependent upon popular interest.  Writing against the fear that the growth of religion will increase warfare and strife, Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue that a democratic and pluralistic culture would help minimize these dangers while maximizing the benefits of religion. Finally, while the authors suggest that [[Islam]] too could be modernized and introduced to a pluralistic culture, they suspect that Islam is less amenable for this transition than Christianity.&lt;ref name=gib/&gt;

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called it "A meaningful contribution to the ongoing conversation about the place of faith in modern life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/john-micklethwait/god-is-back/ |title=''God is Back'' by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge |date=March 15, 2009 |journal=[[Kirkus Reviews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hindu communities''' are found in several countries of South America, but they are strongest in [[Guyana]] and [[Suriname]].
There are about 550,000 [[Hindu]]s in [[South America]], chiefly the descendants of [[India]]n indentured labourers in the [[Guianas]]. There are about 270,000 Hindus in [[Guyana]], 150,000 in [[Suriname]], and some others in [[French Guiana]]. In Guyana, Hindus form 35% of the population.
{{Hinduism by country}}

==Hinduism in Argentina==
Argentina has 2,030 [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|persons of Indian origin]] (PIOs) and 1,300 non-resident Indians (NRIs). Some of them still refer to [[ayurveda]], practice yoga, enjoy Indian classical music and speak the Hindi language.

They have established an Indian Association [http://moia.gov.in/showsublink.asp?sublinkid=184] in the northern [[Provinces of Argentina|provinces]] and organise social and cultural events to celebrate Indian festivals. Unfortunately, there is little interaction between them and those who have settled down in other parts of the extensive country.

A large number of the Indian diaspora living in [[Buenos Aires]] are businessmen, doctors, financial
or business executives, and employees of multinational corporations. Most of them have retained
their Indian citizenship. [http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter19.pdf]

Many [[Hindu]]s are [[Indo-Caribbean]]s from [[Guyana]], [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and [[Suriname]].

==Hinduism in Brazil==
Most of the Brazilian Hindus are ethnic East [[India]]ns. There are 1,500 PIOs and about 400 NRIs in Brazil.

A small number of [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]] that arrived from Suriname and Central America in 1960 to set up shop as traders in the city of [[Manaus]] is considered to be the first wave of immigration. The second wave consisted of university professors who arrived in the 1960s and also in the 1970s.

Other PIOs migrated to this country from various African countries, mainly from former [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonies]] (especially [[Mozambique]]), soon after their independence in the 1970s. The number of PIOs in Brazil has been augmented in recent years by the arrival of nuclear scientists and computer professionals.

There are as many as 1,500 PIOs among the Indian community in Brazil, and only 400 NRIs, since foreign nationals can acquire local citizenship without any discrimination after 15 years of domicile in this country. Brazil has also no bar against dual citizenship. But in recent years, it has been granting immigration visas only in high technology fields. The only exceptions are the Sindhis in Manaus (who have formed an Indian Association with about a hundred members) and the [[Goa]]ns in [[São Paulo]].

==Hinduism in Chile==
A few Indians had gone to [[Chile]] in the 1920s. The others migrated there about 30 years ago{{when|date=August 2017}} &amp;mdash; not
only from India, but also from [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Indonesia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Panama]], the [[Philippines]] and
[[Singapore]].

The total number of PIOs today does not exceed 650 persons in a country of almost
16 million people.

Belonging mostly to the Sindhi community, they are usually engaged in trade
and are reasonably prosperous.

Many of them have married Chilean women and acquired Chilean
nationality, and yet they have largely remained out of the Chilean mainstream. Some members of
the younger generation, being Chilean citizens by birth, have however ventured into professions.

A  Hindu Temple exists in [[Punta Arenas]].

Besides Punta Arenas, the Indian business community is also present in [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]], the capital of Chile, and [[Iquique]]. The activities of businessmen in Santiago are mainly confined to imports and retail stores.

==Hinduism in Colombia==
Hinduism in [[Colombia]] was mainly introduced with the arrival of [[Indian people|Indians]], especially [[Indo-Caribbeans|Indian]] migrant workers from [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]], and [[Suriname]]. There are [[ISKCON]] (''The Hare-Krishnas'') centers in the capital, [[Bogota]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.iskcon.org/node/3365&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism in French Guiana==
{{main article|Hinduism in French Guiana}}
Most of the Hindus in French Guiana are of Surinamese origin. According to the 2000 census 1.6% of the total population (3,200 out of 202,000) were Hindu. [http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Fr_Guiana.html]

==Hinduism in Guyana==
{{Main|Religion in Guyana#Hinduism|Hinduism in Guyana}}
[[File:Central Vaidik Mandir, Georgetown, Guyana..jpg|thumb|200px|Central Vaidik Mandir in Georgetown]]
About 84% of the East Indian immigrants were [[Hindu]]. During the indenture period, the East Indian caste system broke down. Hinduism was redefined, and caste-distinguishing practices were eliminated. Christian missionaries attempted to convert East Indians during the indenture period, beginning in 1852, but met with little success. The missionaries blamed the Brahmins for their failure: the Brahmins began administering spiritual rites to all Hindus regardless of caste once the Christian missionaries started proselytizing in the villages, hastening the breakdown of the caste system. After the 1930s, Hindu conversions to Christianity slowed because the status of Hinduism improved and the discrimination against Hindus  diminished.

In areas where there are large percentage of Indo Guyanese residing together — [[Mandirs]] of various sizes can be found, according to the population. All main Hindu occasions are observed — [[Basant Panchami]] in January to [[Gita Jayanti]] in December.

Since the late 1940s, reform movements caught the attention of many Guyanese Hindus. The most important, the [[Arya Samaj]] movement, arrived in Guyana in 1910. Arya Samaj doctrine rejects the idea of caste and the exclusive role of Brahmins as religious leaders. The movement preaches monotheism and opposition to the use of images in worship as well as many traditional Hindu rituals. The [[Arya Samaj]]is often did not get along with the [[Sanātanī]]s (orthodox [[Hindus]]), but today many have put those differences aside. Approximately between 216,000 and 230,000 identified themselves as Hindus in the 2002 census.

==Hinduism in Paraguay==
In the 2002 census, it was estimated that about 551 Hindus live in [[Paraguay]]. They make up 0.01% of Paraguay's population. Paraguay's ambassador to India, Mr Pappalardo, gave Punjab farmers a high opportunity to invest the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sme.in/CurrentNews.aspx?NewsID=1464 Paraguay's agreement with India]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Hindus live in [[Asunción]].

==Hinduism in Peru==
The first ‘Indian Indians’ to have arrived in [[Peru]] were businessmen who had gone there in the early 1960s. Later on, the community grew in number marginally until the early 80s, after which many of its members left due to the severe local economic crises and the prevailing terrorism. Those with relatives in other Latin countries joined them.

In the recent past, the size of the community has remained stable. There is a small remnant of the original ‘native Indians’ in this country who still maintain their traditional culture and religious beliefs.

Most members of the local Indian community are Sindhis. They are reasonably well-off, but very few can be regarded as prosperous. Their general level of education is low. Most of them speak only their mother tongue and Spanish, with a smattering of English.

There is also here a small number of professionals from other parts of India. Residence permits are not difficult to obtain in Peru. But citizenship is more complicated and only a small number of Indians have obtained it – not more than 10 out of a total number of almost forty persons. While a few cultural activities are organized by the more enterprising PIOs, in general they maintain a low profile. Considering the vast distance that separates the community from India, its interest in its country of origin is limited to major events, mainly derived from occasional browsing on the internet. But being invariably first generation migrants, many of them do occasionally visit India.

==Hinduism in Suriname==
[[File:Arya_Dewaker,_exterior5.jpg|thumb|Arya Dewaker Hindu temple in Paramaribo.]]
{{main|Hinduism in Suriname}}
The story of Hinduism in Suriname is broadly parallel to that in [[Guyana]]. [[Indian indenture system|Indian indentured labourers]] were sent to colonial [[Dutch colonisation of the Guianas|Dutch Guiana]] by special arrangement between the Dutch and British.  
The difference is that the Netherlands' more liberal policy toward Hinduism allowed the culture to develop stronger. Examples are the lack of a rigid caste system and the almost universal reading of [[Gita]] and [[Ramayan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guyanaundersiege.com/cultural/hindus%20of%20south%20america.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the 2012 census of Suriname, Hindus constitute 22.3% of the population.&lt;ref name="CENSUS2012"&gt;[http://www.statistics-suriname.org/images/Presentatie.pdf 2012 Suriname Census Definitive Results]. Algemeen Bureau voor de Statistiek - Suriname.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hindus are mostly concentrated in Northern coastal regions of Suriname: [[Nickerie District|Nickerie]], [[Wanica District|Wanica]] and [[Saramacca District|Saramacca]], where they constitute the largest religious group.  There are several [[hindu]] temples in Suriname.

==Hinduism in Uruguay==
There are a few Yoga organizations in [[Uruguay]], which spread Indian thought
and philosophy-prominent among them are, Sivapremananda Ashram of the Divine
Society. A portion of the beach in [[Montevideo]] has been named after Mahatma
Gandhi and a bust of Gandhiji installed in one of the parks along the beach. There
is a school named after him in Montevideo, a street and another school named after
Republic of India.&lt;ref name="meaindia.nic.in"&gt;[http://meaindia.nic.in/foreignrelation/19fr01.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small Indian community in Uruguay consisting of 300 members approx.

== Hinduism in Venezuela==
During the oil-related high-income years of the 1970s, there were around 400 NRIs in this country. There are also several thousand of [[Indo-Caribbeans]] from [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Suriname]], and [[Guyana]] in the cities of [[Ciudad Guayana]] and [[Caracas]].

The Indian community consisted of personnel from the petroleum and petrochemical sectors, as
well as a large number of traders. Many of them had taken their families with them to Venezuela,
whether from India or elsewhere. Most of the traders belonged to the [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] community but
there were also some persons from Gujarat, Punjab and the southern Indian States.

When the oil boom ended in 1982, followed by devaluation of the local currency, many of the NRIs decided to seek their fortunes elsewhere. Currently, the Diaspora has been whittled down to half its former size. There are now only about 45 Indian families in Venezuela who are mainly engaged in retail trade. There are also a small number of experts in high tech. industries such as telecommunications.

All of them have adapted themselves very well to their country of residence and are generally
held in high regard by the local people on account of their hard work, expertise and non-political
nature.

The Venezuelan Constitution guarantees equal rights without discrimination to all expatriate
personnel. This has facilitated the Indian community’s life.

Another interesting feature is that many local persons are interested in Indian religions and spirituality.

Some members of the Indian community also attend their functions. Most of the NRIs are well educated. However, given their small numbers, they have not formed themselves into an active representative body. But they remain in touch with one another and with the Indian Embassy in Caracas. Even though they have little time to engage in numerous cultural activities, they do
get together to celebrate Indian festivals like [[Diwali]].

On the whole, the Indian community in Venezuela is quite prosperous and has a per capita income
that is above the national average that is itself as high as US$8,300 in terms of PPP. They take an active part in mobilising donations to help in alleviating distress at times of national calamities in India.

'''[[Jainism]]''' is [[India]]'s [[Religion in India|sixth-largest religion]] and is practiced throughout India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140121/jsp/nation/story_17847192.jsp#.VGCbxPmUeSo|title=National minority status for Jains|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-jains-become-sixth-minority-community-1954568|title=Jains become sixth minority community|date=21 January 2014|work=dna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As per the 2011 census, there are only 4,451,753 Jains in the 1.21 billion population of India, the majority living in [[Maharashtra]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Gujarat]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]], however, the influence of Jainism has been far greater on the Indian population than these numbers suggest. Jains can be found in 34 out of 35 states and union territories, with [[Lakshdweep]] being the only union territory without Jains. The state of [[Jharkhand]], with a population of 16,301 Jains also contains the holy pilgrimage centre of [[Shikharji]].

==History==
{{main|History of Jainism}}
Jain doctrine teaches that Jainism has always existed and will always exist,{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=15}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=12}}&lt;ref&gt;Varni, Jinendra; Ed. Prof. Sagarmal Jain, Translated Justice T.K. Tukol and Dr. Narendra Bhandari. ''{{IAST|Samaṇ Suttaṁ}}.'' New Delhi: Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti. “The Historians have so far fully recognized the truth that Tirthankara Mahavira was not the founder of the religion. He was preceded by many tirthankaras. He merely reiterated and rejuvenated that religion. It is correct that history has not been able to trace the origin of the Jaina religion; but historical evidence now available and the result of dispassionate researches in literature have established that Jainism is undoubtedly an ancient religion.” Pp. xii&amp;nbsp;– xiii of introduction by Justice T.K.Tutkol and Dr. K.K. Dixit.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Glasenapp|1999|p=24}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=17}} Like most ancient [[Indian religions]], Jainism has its roots from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], reflecting native spirituality prior to the [[Indo-Aryan migration]] into India.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gerald James (1995) ''India’s Agony over religion '' SUNY Press {{ISBN|0-7914-2412-X}}. “There is some evidence that Jain traditions may be even older than the Buddhist traditions, possibly going back to the time of the Indus valley civilization, and that Vardhamana rather than being a “founder” per se was, rather, simply a primary spokesman for much older tradition.

===Accorded National minority status for Jain===
On January 20, 2014, the [[Government of India]] awarded the minority status to the Jain community in India, as per Section 2(c) of the [[National Commission for Minorities]] (NCM) Act (NCM), 1992. This made the Jain community which makes for 4.5 million or 0.36 percent of the population as per 2011 census, the sixth community to be designated this status as a "national minority", after Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/fMzSdy9is9fL2R9QBwWA3I/Govt-grants-minority-status-to-Jain-community.html|title=Govt grants minority status to Jain community|author=PTI|work=livemint.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Jains already had minority status in 11 states of India including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, in 2005 a petition was filed with Supreme Court of India, by community representatives, which was also backed by the National Minorities Commission.

The '''Jalali calendar''' is a solar calendar that was used in [[Persia]], variants of which today are still in use in Iran and Afghanistan. In [[Iran]], the Persian names of the zodiac are used while in [[Afghanistan]] the original Arabic names are used, also known as the [[Solar Hijri Calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Solar Hijri |url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Hijri_calendar |publisher = Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gains approximately 1 day on the [[Julian calendar]] every 128 years. The tropical Jalali calendar ({{lang-fa|گاه‌شماری جلالی or تقویم جلالی}}), which inherited some aspects from the [[Yazdgerdi calendar]], was adopted on 15 March 1079 by the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] [[Sultan]] [[Jalal al-Din Malik Shah I]] (for whom it was named), based on the recommendations of a committee of astronomers, including [[Omar Khayyam]], at the [[Isfahan Observatory|imperial observatory]] in his capital city of [[Isfahan]].&lt;ref name = mactutor/&gt; Month computations were based on solar transits through the zodiac. It remained in use for eight centuries. It arose out of dissatisfaction with the seasonal drift in the Islamic calendar which is due to that calendar being lunar instead of solar; a lunar year of 354 days, while acceptable to a desert nomad people, proved to be unworkable for settled, agricultural peoples, and the Iranian calendar is one of several non-lunar calendars adopted by settled Muslims for agricultural purposes (others include the [[Coptic calendar]], the [[Julian calendar]], and the Semitic calendars of the Near East). Sultan Jalal commissioned the task in 1073. Its work was completed well before the Sultan's death in 1092, after which the observatory would be abandoned.&lt;ref name=mactutor&gt;
{{cite web
|title = Omar Khayyam

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The year was computed from the vernal equinox ([[Nowruz]]), and each month was determined by the transit
of the sun into the corresponding zodiac region, a system that incorporated improvements on the ancient Indian system of the [[Surya Siddhanta]] (''Surya''=solar, ''Siddhanta''=analysis, 4th century), also the basis of most Hindu calendars.  Since the solar transit times can have 24-hour variations, the length of the months vary slightly in different years (each month can be between 29 and 32 days). For example, the months in the two last years of the Jalali calendar had:
* 1303 AP: 30, 31, 32, 31, 32, 30, 31, 30, 29, 30, 29, and 30 days,
* 1302 AP: 30, 31, 32, 31, 31, 31, 31, 29, 30, 29, 30, and 30 days.

Because months were computed based on precise times of solar transit between zodiacal regions, seasonal drift never exceeded one day, and also there was no need for a leap year in the Jalali calendar.  However, this calendar was very difficult to compute; it required full [[ephemeris]] computations and actual observations to determine the apparent movement of the Sun.  Some claim that simplifications introduced in the intervening years may have introduced a system with eight leap days in every cycle of 33 years.  (Different rules, such as the 2820-year cycle, have also been accredited to Khayyam).  However, the original Jalali calendar based on observations (or predictions) of solar transit would not have needed either leap years or seasonal adjustments.

Owing to the variations in month lengths, and also the difficulty in computing the calendar itself, the Iranian calendar was modified to simplify these aspects in 1925 (1304 AP), resulting in the [[Solar Hijri calendar]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3196">[[File:Tenrikyo Service dance.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Tenrikyo [[Service (Tenrikyo)|Service]] performed in front of the ''Jiba.'']]

In the [[Tenrikyo]] [[religion]], the '''Jiba''' (ぢば) is the ''[[axis mundi]]'' where adherents believe that [[God in Tenrikyo|God]] created [[humankind]]. The spot is located in the center of the main sanctuary at [[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters]], located in [[Tenri|Tenri, Nara]], [[Japan]]. It is marked by a wooden pillar called the ''Kanrodai'' (かんろだい).

==Significance==
The significance of ''Jiba'' is described in all three [[Tenrikyo]] [[scriptures]] – the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'', the ''[[Mikagura-uta]]'', and the ''[[Osashizu]]''. Phrases in the scriptures define ''Jiba'' as simply "the origin," and more specifically "the origin where God began human beings," "the origin of this world," and "the origin of all things." In the context of Tenrikyo's [[Tenrikyo creation narrative|creation narrative]], the ''Jiba'' is said to be the spot where ''Izanagi-no-Mikoto'' and ''Izanami-no-Mikoto,'' the models of husband and wife, conceived the first children. The scriptures also assert that ''Jiba'' is the place where [[God in Tenrikyo|God the Parent]] and the [[Nakayama Miki|everliving Oyasama]] reside.{{sfn|Mori|2016|pp=16–18}}

The ''Jiba'' is closely associated with Tenrikyo's understanding of [[salvation]]. The core ritual of Tenrikyo's [[liturgy]], the [[Service_(Tenrikyo)#Kagura_Service|Kagura Service]], is performed around ''Jiba''.{{sfn|Mori|2016|pp=34–35}} The ''Osashizu'' and stories from ''[[Anecdotes of Oyasama]]'' refer to Jiba as the place where one can request one's own salvation or the salvation of others, and accordingly an important religious practice for adherents is to make [[pilgrimage|pilgrimages]] there.{{sfn|Mori|2016|pp=18–24}}

==Kanrodai==
[[File:Tenrikyo Kanrodai sketch.jpg|thumb|The Inner Sanctuary of Tenrikyo Church Headquarters, which contains the ''Kanrodai.'']]

The ''[[Kanrodai]]'' (かんろだい) is a [[Hexagon|hexagonal]] stand that marks the ''Jiba.'' Adherents believe that when the hearts of human beings have been adequately purified through the [[Service (Tenrikyo)|Service]], a sweet dew would fall from the heavens onto a vessel placed on top of the stand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7454">The '''Catholic Church in the South Sea''' ([[Oceania]], excluding the national episcopal conferences of Australia, of New Zealand, each with dependencies, and of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands) consists only of a variety of Latin jurisdictions, usually covering a whole island state (whether nation or overseas territory of a foreign power) or even more than one, none of which has a large enough episcopate to warrant a national [[episcopal conference]], so they jointly form the Latin "Episcopal Conference of the [South] Pacific", headquartered in [[Suva]] (on [[Fiji]]). It comprises only: 
{{Catholic Church by country}}
* five transnational [[ecclesiastical province]]s, each headed by a Metropolitan Archbishopric, with a total of eleven [[suffragan]]s: eight bishoprics and -exceptionally, as those are generally exempt- three pre-diocesan (an [[apostolic prefecture]] and two [[independent mission]]s)
* on exempt diocese, directly subject to the Holy See, on Tonga.

There are no proper Eastern Catholic jurisdictions or quasi-diocesan Ordinariates, but the [[Byzantine Rite]] [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]] faithful are served by the [[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Saints Peter and Paul of Melbourne]], in and for all Australia, also covering New Zealand and further Oceania.

There are no individual papal diplomatic representations to several British, French, Australian, New Zealand and US overseas possessions (strictly speaking diplomatically covered by the home countries), but the ''[[Apostolic Delegation]] to the Pacific Ocean'', headquartered externally at [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], covers [[American Samoa]], [[French Polynesia]], [[Guam]] (US), [[New Caledonia]] (French), [[Niue]] (New Zealand]], [[Norfolk Island]] (Australia, pastorally under its Sydney Archdiocese), [[Northern Mariana Islands]] (US), [[Pitcairn Islands]] (UK), [[Tokelau]] (NZ), [[U.S. Minor Islands]] (pastorally served by the [[Archdiocese for the Military Services of the United States]]) and [[ Wallis and Futuna]] (French). It also deals with independent [[Tuvalu]].
 
There is formally an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] as papal diplomatic representation  (embassy level) to the [[Fiji Islands]], but it is vested in the Apostolic Nunciature to New Zealand, in its capital [[Wellington]].

There is formally an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] to [[Cook Islands]], but it is vested in the Apostolic Nunciature to associated mother country New Zealand in its capital Wellington.

There is formally an Apostolic Nunciature to each of the following nations, but they are all vested in the Apostolic Nunciature to New Zealand, in its capital Wellington :
* [[Kiribati]].
* [[Marshall Islands]]
* the [[Federated States of Micronesia]]
* [[Samoa]]
* [[Tonga]]
* [[Vanuatu]].

==Background and Family==
Munib Shahid was born in 1908 in [[Acre, Palestine]] to a prominent [[Bahá'u'lláh's family|Bahá'í lineage]].  His parents were Mírzá Jalal, an [[Afnán]], and Rúḥá Khánum.  His paternal grandfather was Mírzá Muhammad-Hasan, titled "[[Núrayn-i-Nayyirayn|King of the Martyrs]]," while his maternal grandparents were [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the successor to the [[Bahá'í]] founder-prophet [[Bahá'u'lláh]], and [[Munirih Khánum]].  As a prominent member of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], Munib Shahid worked diligently to promote his faith.  As a medical student at the American University of Beirut, his friends included such prominent Bahá'ís as future [[Hand of the Cause of God]] [[Abu'l-Qásim Faizi]].  After graduating from medical school, Munib Shahid would continue to promote the Bahá'í Faith, and in 1937 he visited Bahá'í communities in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Effendi |first= Shoghi | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |date= 1980 |title= The Baha'i World 1936-1938 (Volume VII)  |url= https://bahai.works/Bah%C3%A1%E2%80%99%C3%AD_World/Volume_7/Part_1/Survey_of_Current_Bah%C3%A1%E2%80%99%C3%AD_Activities_in_the_East_and_West#pg110  |location= |publisher= Baha'i Publishing Trust |page= 110 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Munib Shahid married [[Serene Husseini Shahid|Serene Husseini]], the daughter of [[Jamal al-Husayni]].  [[Shoghi Effendi]], the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]] of the Bahá'í Faith and Munib's cousin through `Abdu'l-Bahá's eldest daughter Ḍíyá'íyyih Khánum, labeled this marriage a "treacherous act" and excommunicated Munib Shahid as a [[Covenant-breaker]].  Shoghi Effendi sent the following cable to the Bahá'í world in November 1944:

{{quote|Monib Shahid, grandson of both `Abdu'l-Bahá and the [[Núrayn-i-Nayyirayn|King of Martyrs]], married according to the Moslem rites the daughter of a political exile who is [[Jamal al-Husayni|nephew]] of the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]. This treacherous act of alliance with enemies of the Faith merits condemnation of entire Bahá'í world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | date=December 1944| title=Messages from the Guardian |url=https://bahai.works/Baha%27i_News/Issue_172 |newspaper=Bahá'í News|issue=172 |access-date=May 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Bahá'í News]]'', No. 172)}}

Munib and Serene Husseini continued to live in Beirut, where he pursued his academic career, and she promoted cottage industries among [[Palestinian refugees]].  Serene Shahid wrote a critically acclaimed autobiography of her childhood, titled, ''Jerusalem Memories.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Shahid |first= Serene|authorlink= Serene Husseini Shahid |date= 1999 |title= Jerusalem Memories |url= http://www.palestine-studies.org/sites/default/files/jq-articles/37-jerusalem_childhood_2.pdf |location= Beirut, Lebanon |publisher= Naufal |page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple had three daughters, including [[Leila Shahid]].

Munib Shahid died in 1973.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

''' Nanakmatta''' is a historical town named after the [[Sikh]] pilgrimage site, [[Gurdwara Nanak Mata Sahib]], in the state of [[Uttarakhand]]. The town is associated with [[Guru Nanak]] Dev and [[Guru Hargobind]]. It is situated on the bank of Deoha stream, which has since been dammed into a reservoir named Nanak Sagar. The Gurudwara is located 15 kilometres west of [[Khatima]] Railway Station on road to [[Tanakpur]]. The holy shrine is near the town of [[Sitarganj]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://usnagar.nic.in/Nanakmatta%20photo.htm Nanakmatta] [[Udham Singh Nagar district]] Official website.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of three Sikh Holy places in the state, with others being [[Hemkund|Gurdwara Hemkunt Sahib]] and [[Gurudwara Reetha Sahib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Uttaranchal – A Paradise Of Tourists |url=http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr2002/fsep2002/f240920021.html |date=24 September 2002|publisher=Press Information Bureau, Govt. of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurudwara Sri Nanakmatta Sahib is associated with the first [[Sikh]] Guru, [[Guru Nanak Dev]] who went there during his third [[Udasi]] in 1514, in which he travelled to [[Mount Kailash]]. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} At that time, Gurdwara Sri Nanakmatta Sahib was the abode of the devotees of Guru Gorakhnath and it was called "Gorakhmata".

It is also a [[Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly]] constituency within the [[Nainital-Udhamsingh Nagar (Lok Sabha constituency)]].

==Karsewa at Gurudwara ==
Before 1937, the gurudwara was maintained by mahants. A small gurudwara was constructed by the local people. The land for the Gurudwara was donated by Nawab Mehndi Ali Khan. Karsewa began in 1975. The gurudwara building is magnificent and has marble all over. The complex consists of the main hall, the langar hall, the parikarama, the sarai, offices, etc. A second gurudwara, Gurudwara Patshahi Sixth, is also present here. The [[Ficus religiosa|pipal]] tree under which Guru Nanak Dev  sat can also be seen between the main building and Gurudwara Patshahi Chhevi.

About 140&amp;nbsp;km from this shrine is another famous spot called [[Gurudwara Reetha Sahib]]. When Guru Nanak along with companion [[Bhai Mardana|Mardana]] visited this place, he took rest under a [[Soapnut]] (Reetha) tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3969">'''[[Rabbi Zeira]]'s stringency''' ({{lang-arc|חומרא דרבי זירא}}) or the '''stringency of the daughters of Israel''' (Hebrew חומרת בנות ישראל) relates to the law of [[niddah]] (a woman during [[menstruation]]) and refers to the stringency expounded in the [[Talmud]] where an additional five days are added to the Torah-based seven-day niddah prohibition as applicable in Torah law and rabbinic Judaism.

The stringency was enacted due to the confusion of Jewish women between the counting of niddah (i.e. 7 day counting from onset of menstrual flow), [[zavah]] ktanah (minor zavah, i.e. one "clean" day of counting) and zavah gedolah (zavah major, i.e. seven clean day counting). Thus, the most stringent of all three, the zavah gedolah state, was accepted as the new norm of minimal [[tumah and taharah|tammei]] period.

==Chronology==
The Torah-based niddah laws were initiated with the reported giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai in the year [[Hebrew Calendar|HC]] 2448 (-1313 BCE). The stringency was established approximately 1,500 years later, during the [[Amoraim|amoraic]] period in approximately HC 3961 (200 CE). The extended lapse in timeline giving way to the stringency is viewed as being an outcome of the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem and the ensuing scattering and turmoil.

===Kohen instruction===
{{Main article|The Torah instruction of the Kohanim}}
Torah commentaries explain that the priests ([[kohanim]]) are instructed to differentiate between the blood of niddah, and non-menstrual blood flow zavah ([[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]] to Leviticus 15:1), thus sparing any unneeded stringency. While the absence of their ability to instruct was included in the prophecy of [[Azariah (prophet)|Azaryah]] (son of [[Oded (father of Azariah)|Oded]]) ([[Divrei HaYamim]] 2, 15:1) that the kohen will be at a loss to deliver accurate Torah instruction,&lt;ref&gt;"And many days to Israel..without a kohen instructor and without Torah" וְיָמִים רַבִּים לְיִשְׂרָאֵל לְלֹא אֱלֹהֵי אֱמֶת וּלְלֹא כֹּהֵן מוֹרֶה וּלְלֹא תוֹרָה&lt;/ref&gt; other texts&lt;ref&gt;([[Yirmiyahu]] 18:18 "..Since Torah will not be lost from/by the kohen" כִּי לֹא תֹאבַד תּוֹרָה מִכֹּהֵן&lt;/ref&gt; related a return of the Torah instruction to the kohen and the retraction of the said stringency to the Torah-based 7 day period alone.

==Halakhic status of the stringency==
The [[Talmud Bavli]] disagrees on how to view the said stringency in terms of it being categorized as a [[minhag|custom]] or a [[halakha|law]], Ravah -in dialogue with his Mentor [[Rav Papa|Rav Pappa]], abstained from viewing it as an halakha, saying that it is location-based, with communities fully entitled not to comply. [[Rashi]] views Ravah comments to his mentor as hinting that the said stringency evolved into a [[takanah]].&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Bavli, Niddah p.&amp;nbsp;66 - 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rambam]] (Hilkhot Issurei Biah 11, 3-4) viewed the stringency as is, a "stringency" alone and not a rabbinic enactment, but he nonetheless advocated adherence to it since (by his era) all known communities abided by it, making it as a [[neder]] (vow) that is implicitly applicable.

===Rabbi Kook's leniency===
Among other [[poskim]], [[Rabbi Kook|Rabbi Avraham HaKohen Kook]] was of the opinion the stringency is on par with any other rabbinic prohibition, and perhaps lesser than a full-blown rabbinic prohibition. Thus, if need arise to seek leniency from it, leniency may be sought, and applied.&lt;ref&gt;Daath Kohen responsa, ch. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religious offense''' means any action which offends religious [[Sensibility|sensibilities]] and arouses serious negative [[emotions]] in people with strong belief and which is usually associated with an [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] response to, or correction of, [[sin]].

==Causes==

{{main|Sacred-profane dichotomy}}
At the turn of the 20th century the French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] considered the dichotomy between the sacred and the profane to be the central characteristic of religion. There is also a dichotomy between religious communities and advocates of [[multiculturalism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Research in Multicultural Education &amp; International Perspectives|author=Farideh Salili &amp; Rumjahn Hoosain (editors) |publisher=Information Age Publishing |date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vocabulary used in such debates may sometimes be either confused or confusing, and the misuse of religiously technical terms as understood in secular societies can, in itself cause religious offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Handbook of Conflict Resolution: Theory and Practice|author=Nadja Alexander|year=2001|publisher=Deutsch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred===
{{main|Sacred}} 
Things that are sacred are [[Creed|articles of faith]] that are beyond question true sources of [[Ecstasy (emotion)|rapture]] for believers and followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Neurobiology of Bliss - The Sacred and the Profane |first=Nadia|last=Webb|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-neurobiology-of-bliss-sacred-and-profane/|publisher=Scientific American|date=2011-07-12|accessdate =2012-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contradiction or misuse is likely to cause religious offense.

===Secular ===
{{main|Secularity}}
Things that are worldly such as [[technology]] or [[Profession|professional advice]] are sometimes separated from things that are holy or sacred for religious people. Some secular activities may be considered profane and so cause religious offense, even though they may be legally permitted. [[Crime]] is the secular homologue to religious sin.

===Profane===
{{main|Profanum}}
Actions that are not religiously permitted 'inside the faith' are often prohibited within religiously dominated jurisdictions. [[Profanity]] is not necessarily proscribed within secular jurisdictions and so legally permitted actions under [[common law]] may sometimes be considered religiously offensive to people used to religious legal structures.

===Actions which cause offense===
Different [[religion]]s are sensitive to different things in different measure, particularly such topics,  as sexuality, infancy, society, and warfare. It would be impossible to itemize all specific offences defined in all jurisdictions.

However every religion is essentially a set of [[belief]]s conveyed from generation to generation which are, by religious definition, [[Theology|held to be immutable]] [[truth]]s by that religion's believers or followers. Anything that tends to weaken or break that chain of [[authority|authoritative]] continuity is likely to be offensive and in some jurisdictions severely punishable.

Religious offense can be caused [[hate crime|deliberately]] or by [[Religious intolerance]], especially between specific religious beliefs regarding 'sacred truth'. The secular belief that [[freedom of speech]] and the absence of [[censorship]] should allow religious practices or beliefs to be criticized is also a cause of conflict.
{{main|The Satanic Verses}}
The use or misuse of religious [[Paraphernalia]], particularly [[scripture]] may also cause offense. The publication of a prizewinning novel by a Muslim author resulted in several deaths from rioting as well as murders and attempted murders resulting from a [[decree]] issued by a [[Ruhollah Khomeini|religious leader]] who was religiously offended by the work.

==Traditionally==

Traditionally there are three uniquely '''religious offenses''' (acts which cause religious offense):

* [[Heresy]] (wrong choice)  means questioning or [[insubordination|doubting]] dogmatic established beliefs 
* [[Blasphemy]] (evil-speaking) is the act of insulting or showing contempt for a religious [[deity]].  
* [[Apostasy]] (revolt or renunciation) implies or abandoning of a prescribed religious [[duty]], especially [[loyalty|disloyalty]] [[sedition]] and [[defection]]

[[Dogma]] is the belief that a religion necessarily only ever expresses divine truth. Any challenge to [[God|divine authority]] may be homologous  to [[treason]] and attract similar serious [[punishment]], typically the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Erik |last=Owens|title=Religion and the Death Penalty: A Call for Reckoning |isbn=978-0802821720}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blasphemy laws are darkening Pakistan's skies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/nov/09/blasphemy-laws-darkening-pakistan-skies|publisher=guardian.co.uk|date= 11 November 2012|last=Hameed | first=Salman }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE DEATH PENALTY, MERCY AND ISLAM: A CALL FOR RETROSPECTION |url=http://www.scholarofthehouse.org/depemeandisc.html |author= Dr. Khaled Abou El Fadl |publisher=Scholar of the House | accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==More recently==

More recently the term is used in modern laws which aim promote religious tolerance by forbidding '[[hate crime]]' such as the British  [[Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006]]. To allow 'outsiders' to criticize a religion or its practice might appear to serve to weaken or break the chain of intergenerational "truth-telling".

There is a fine line between secular ideas of [[fair comment]] and religious offence caused by questioning the veracity of [[divine revelation]].

===Legal===
[[Blasphemy law]]s were once almost universal, and are still common in states with strong religious traditions, but such restrictions have been extinguished in most secular jurisdictions that incorporate the principles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR).

Article 18 of the UDHR allows: "the right to "freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance"; and Article 19 allows: "the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers". With these two articles, Article 18 of the UDHR allows people to hold and express religious ideas and other beliefs or a lack of religious belief that may be offensive to others or to the majority of citizens and Article 19 explicitly mandates [[freedom of speech]] which permits citizens to criticize leaders in a way that some religious people may find seriously offensive.

Some Islamic traditions found this unacceptable and produced [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] Article 24 of which enshrines [[Sharia]] law as supreme, and that judicial code includes severe penalties including death for the three offences of Heresy, Blasphemy, and Apostacy, and also includes capital punishment for Moslems (persons who are born into Islam or swear allegiance to it) who refuse to kill when required to do so according to law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What does the Religion of Peace Teach About Apostasy|url=http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/Quran/012-apostasy.htm|accessdate=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Source is a site dedicated to examining "the ideological threat that Islam poses to human dignity and freedom."|date=August 2017}}

Some extreme religious leaders in such secular societies campaign for the offence of blasphemy to be reinstated to enforce respect for their various religious beliefs above any scientific or moral challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Islamic states to reopen quest for global blasphemy law|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-09-19/news/sns-rt-us-protests-religions-blasphemybre88i1eg-20120919_1_blasphemy-law-muslim-cleric-ekmeleddin-ihsanoglu|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=19 September 2012|accessdate = 14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
{{main|Antiscience}}
[[Science]] depends on [[testability]], but, as relatively few advanced scientific  facts are testable by non-scientists, scientific material is sometimes disseminated by reference to learned material which is assumed to be reliable (as presented in Wikipedia references) in much the same way as religionists quote 'reliable' holy scripture. This may lead to science being taught to young people  as a belief in scientific  truth in much the same way as religious truths are taught, For example, when instruction or belief is based on faith in received [[wisdom]] from scholars or from [[textbook]] evidence which may be difficult or impossible for non-specialists to verify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Dawkins|title=Is science a religion?|publisher=The Humanist Magazine (UK)|date=January–February 1997|url=http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html|accessdate=2012-12-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020822070505/http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html|archivedate=2002-08-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{main|Relationship between religion and science}}
Religious pseudoscience includes [[witchcraft]] that is beyond traditional [[midwife]]ry practices and [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]] other than [[traditional medicine]], which insists on [[supernatural]] or [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]al or [[miracle|miraculous]] intervention which is contrary to scientific evidence. For example, the Medieval Catholic faith in Europe was offended by, and persecuted, sometimes killed people whose practices were related to sexuality, particularly [[:fr:Sage-femme|wise women]] now known as [[Midwife|midwives]].&lt;ref name =uta&gt;{{cite book|title=Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: The Catholic Church and Sexuality|author=Uta Ranke-Heinemann|isbn=0 14 016500 2|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social===
&lt;!-- References are in Danish cartoon article--&gt;
Justifiable criticism, particularly [[Satire|satirizing]] of ideas which in secular cultures may seem absurd  [[belief]]s, but which are considered incontrovertible religious [[fact]]s may be interpreted or misinterpreted as either [[religious persecution]] or [[racism]] if made by outsiders or one of the three traditional offences mentioned above if published by co-religionists.

An example of this is the  [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]]

==Religious law==
{{Main|Religious law}}
Religious law refers to [[ethical code|ethical]] and [[Morality#Moral codes|moral codes]] taught by [[religious tradition]]s. Examples include [[Canon law]] which is [[Christian]] church law, customary ''[[halakha]]' the ' [[Judaism|Jewish]] law, [[Hindu law]], and the above mentioned ''[[Sharia]]'' or [[Islam]]ic law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gad |last=Barzilai |title=Law and Religion|publisher=Ashgate |year=2007 |isbn=9780754624943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of religion and law===
The origin of religion is uncertain, but it has been suggested that it evolved for the nurture of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding |first=Sarah|last=Blaffer Hrdy |isbn=9780674032996 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly much religious law is concerned with sexuality and with childcare.

{{Main|Code of Hammurabi}}

The oldest known comprehensive written law  dates from almost four thousand years ago. It survives because the sixth [[Babylon]]ian king, [[Hammurabi]] had it inscribed  on a human-sized stone ''[[stele]]'' erected in cities throughout his kingdom. Fragments of much earlier [[law code]]s have also survived via records dating from [[Writing#The beginning of writing|dawn of writing]].

The subjects that the Code of Hammurabi covers are similar to modern legal codes, for it includes  religious observance,  social conduct and occupational duties which covers military and contractual obligations as well as the control of slavery throughout all of Babylon at that time.

===Gender equality===
[[Gender equality]] is a relatively recent philosophy, mainly evolved in the [[Western world]] during the 20th century. Previously, sexual discrimination was socially commonplace and legally institutionalized, perhaps because distinct gender roles may have had some [[prehistory|early human]] survival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Homo religiosus - The Natural History of Religion|url=http://www.scilogs.eu/en/blog/biology-of-religion/2009-05-11/homo-religiosus-the-natural-history-of-religion| date=11 May 2009|accessdate=12 December 2012|first=Michael|last=Blume|publisher=SciLogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; or  [[Economic history|historical economic]] value&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Complementarianism: Religion, Women's Work and the Economy|first=Soraya|last=Chemaly|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/mitt-romneys-faith-is-ent_b_1581284.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=2012-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  or else may have promoted [[social cohesion]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights dates only from the mid-20th century (it was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948, and then incorporated into various legal systems some time after that). However UNHDR Articles 1 and 2 had, by the early 21st century, frequently been interpreted by [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] [[jurist]]s such that any form of (non-biological) [[Sexism|sexual discrimination]] has become illegal in many secular countries, while in legal jurisdictions strongly influenced by religious considerations sex discrimination may still be legally required and sometimes rigorously enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Neuwirth, Jessica (2004). [http://www.msmagazine.com/summer2004/globalwomenlaw.asp "Unequal: A Global Perspective on Women Under the Law"]. ''Ms. Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scriptural Infallibility===
{{main|Infallibility#In_theology}}
Because writing is not susceptible to the sort of corruption common in verbal communication scripture can be revered and held sacred, so any criticism or inclusion in secondary works is likely to be offensive to some religionists. A [[little big planet|game]] which included two short scriptural phrases was considered offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/3227971/Sony-Playstation-game-Little-Big-Planet-delayed-after-anti-Muslim-claims.html|title=Sony Playstation game Little Big Planet delayed after anti-Muslim claims |date=2008-10-20|accessdate=2012-12-18|publisher=Telegraph newspaper UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology and significance ==
The noun ''šahāda'' ({{lang|ar|{{large|شَهادة}}}}), from the verbal root ''šahida'' ({{IPA-ar|ˈʃahɪd(a)|}} {{lang|ar|{{large|شَهِدَ}}}}) meaning "to observe, witness, testify", translates as "testimony" in both the everyday and the legal senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Hans|author2=J. Milton Cowan|title=A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic|url=https://archive.org/details/Dict_Wehr.pdf|year=1976|pages=488–489|access-date=26 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221083021/https://archive.org/details/Dict_Wehr.pdf|archive-date=21 December 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The related noun [[Shahid|''šahīd'']] ({{IPA-ar|ʃaˈhiːd|}}
{{lang|ar|{{large|شَهيد}}}}), which is used in the Quran mainly in the sense "witness", has paralleled in its development the Greek ''martys'' ({{lang-gr|μάρτυς}}) in that it may mean both "witness" and "martyr".&lt;ref&gt;David Cook, ''Martyrdom (Shahada)'' [http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195390155/obo-9780195390155-0124.xml Oxford Bibliographies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101082246/http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195390155/obo-9780195390155-0124.xml |date=1 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encycle"&gt;''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Volume IX, Klijkebrille, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;201.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''šahāda'' may also mean "martyrdom" although in modern Arabic the more commonly used word for "martyrdom" is another derivative of the same root, [[w:Istishhad|''istišhād'']] ({{lang|ar|{{large|اسْتِشْهادْ}}}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Wortabet|author2=Harvey Porter|title=English-Arabic and Arabic-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fju5UH9dO3YC&amp;pg=PA238|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Asian Educational Services|page=238|access-date=26 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429014317/https://books.google.com/books?id=Fju5UH9dO3YC&amp;pg=PA238|archive-date=29 April 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The Islamic creed is also called, in the [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form, ''šahādatān'' ({{lang|ar|{{large|شَهادَتانْ}}}}, literally "two testimonials"). The expression ''al-šahāda'' (the Witnessed) is used in [[Quran]] as one of the "[[Names of God in Islam|titles of God]]".&lt;ref name="Cornell8"&gt;Cornell, p.&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sunni Islam]], the ''Shahada'' has two parts: ''la ilaha illa'llah'' (None has the right to be worshipped except [[Allah|God]]), and ''Muhammadun rasul Allah'' ([[Muhammad]] is the messenger of God),&lt;ref name="LS"&gt;Lindsay, p.&amp;nbsp;140–141&lt;/ref&gt; which are sometimes referred to as the first ''Shahada'' and the second ''Shahada''.&lt;ref name="Cornell9"/&gt; The first statement of the ''Shahada'' is also known as the ''[[tahlil|tahlīl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Anthony Sells|title=Approaching the Qur'an: The Early Revelations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EYCFTVDDKmkC|year=1999|publisher=White Cloud Press|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Shia Islam]], the ''Shahada'' also has a third part, a phrase concerning [[Ali]], the first [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Shia Imam]] and the fourth [[Rashidun|Rashid caliph]] of [[Sunni Islam]]: {{lang|ar|{{large|وعليٌ وليُّ الله}}}} ({{transl|ar|DIN|wa ʿalīyyun walīyyu-llāh}} {{IPA-ar|wa ʕaˈlɪj.jʊn waˈlɪj.jʊlˈɫɑː|}}), which translates to "Ali is the ''[[wali]]'' of God".&lt;ref&gt;''The Later Mughals'' by [[William Irvine (historian)|William Irvine]] p.&amp;nbsp;130&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Quran]], the first statement of the ''Shahadah'' takes the form ''la ilaha illa'llah'' twice (37:35, 47:19), and ''allahu la ilaha illa hu'' (God, None has the right to be worshipped but He) much more often.&lt;ref name="Nasr110"&gt; Nasr et al  (2015). ''The Study Quran''. HarperOne. p. 110. (Footnote 255)&lt;/ref&gt; It appears in the shorter form ''la ilaha illa Hu'' (None has the right to be worshipped except He) in many places.&lt;ref name="Nasr1356"&gt;Nasr et al (2015). ''The Study Quran''. HarperOne. p. 1356. (Footnote 22)&lt;/ref&gt; It appears in these forms about 30 times in the Quran, and never attached with the other parts of the ''Shahadah'' in Sunni or Shia Islam or "in conjunction with another name".&lt;ref name="Yuksel318"&gt;[[Edip Yuksel]] et al (2007). ''Quran: A Reformist Translation''.  Brainbrow Press. Footnote 3:18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam's monotheistic nature is reflected in the first sentence of the ''Shahada'', which declares belief in the oneness of God and that he is the only entity truly worthy of worship.&lt;ref name="Cornell9"/&gt; The second sentence of the ''Shahada'' indicates the means by which God has offered guidance to human beings.&lt;ref name="Cornell10"&gt;Cornell, p.&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/ref&gt; The verse reminds Muslims that they accept not only the prophecy of Muhammad but also the long line of prophets who preceded him.&lt;ref name="Cornell10"/&gt; While the first part is seen as a cosmic truth, the second is specific to Islam, as it is understood that members of the older [[Abrahamic religions]] do not view Muhammad as one of their prophets.&lt;ref name="Cornell10"/&gt;

The ''Shahada'' is a statement of both ritual and worship. In a well-known [[Hadith of Gabriel|hadith]], Muhammad defines Islam as witnessing that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is God's messenger, giving of alms (''[[zakat]]''), performing the [[Salah|ritual prayer]], [[fasting]] during the month of [[Ramadan]] and making a [[hajj|pilgrimage]] to the [[Kaaba]]: the [[Five Pillars of Islam|''five pillars'']] of Islam are inherent in this declaration of faith.&lt;ref name="Cornell9"&gt;Cornell, p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, p.&amp;nbsp;149&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recitation ==
Recitation of the ''Shahādah'' is the most common statement of faith for Muslims.

Though the two statements of the ''Shahada'' are both present in the Quran (for example, 37:35 and 48:29), they are not found there side by side as in the ''Shahada'' formula.&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt; Versions of both phrases began to appear in coins and monumental architecture in the late seventh century, which suggests that it had not been officially established as a ritual statement of faith until then.&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt; An inscription in the [[Dome of the Rock]] (est. 692) in [[Jerusalem]] reads "There is no god but God alone; He has no partner with him; Muhammad is the messenger of God".&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt; Another variant appears in coins minted after the reign of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]], the fifth [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliph]], in the form "Muhammad is the servant of God and His messenger".&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt; Although it is not clear when the ''Shahada'' first came into common use among Muslims, it is clear that the sentiments it expresses were part of the Quran and Islamic doctrine from the earliest period.&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt;

== In Sufism ==

The ''Shahada'' has been traditionally recited in the [[Sufism|Sufi]] ceremony of ''[[dhikr]]'' ({{lang-ar|ذِکْر }}, "[[:wikt:ذكر#Noun|remembrance]]"), a ritual that resembles mantras found in many other religious traditions.&lt;ref name="Netton"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Islam|author=Ian Richard Netton|date=19 December 2013|page=143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYtmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143|access-date=27 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422225241/https://books.google.com/books?id=bYtmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143|archive-date=22 April 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ceremony, the ''Shahada'' may be repeated thousands of times, sometimes in the shortened form of the first phrase where the word ''Allah'' is replaced by ''huwa'' (He).&lt;ref name="Netton"/&gt; The chanting of the ''Shahada'' sometimes provides a rhythmic background for singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Among the Jasmine Trees: Music and Modernity in Contemporary Syria|author=Jonathan Holt Shannon|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|year=2006|pages=110–111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=018rXo5ieDcC&amp;pg=PA110|access-date=27 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422234900/https://books.google.com/books?id=018rXo5ieDcC&amp;pg=PA110|archive-date=22 April 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Shahada'' appears as an architectural element in Islamic buildings around the world, such as those in Jerusalem, [[Cairo]], and [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Islamic Architecture in Cairo: An Introduction|author=Doris Behrens-Abouseif|publisher=Brill|year=1989|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=INsmT6zjAl8C&amp;pg=PA54|access-date=27 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422235344/https://books.google.com/books?id=INsmT6zjAl8C&amp;pg=PA54|archive-date=22 April 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture|author=Oleg Grabar (ed.)|publisher=Brill|year=1985|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xu_L_FJRvUIC&amp;pg=PA110|access-date=27 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422212417/https://books.google.com/books?id=Xu_L_FJRvUIC&amp;pg=PA110|archive-date=22 April 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use on flags ==
{{further information|Islamic flags|Black Standard#Jihadist black flag}}

The ''Shahada'' is found on some [[Islamic flags]].
[[Wahhabism]] used the ''Shahada'' on their flags since the 18th century.&lt;ref name=firefly&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Firefly Books|title=Firefly Guide to Flags of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FsxaAAAAYAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Firefly Books|isbn=978-1-55297-813-9|access-date=19 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618174628/https://books.google.com/books?id=FsxaAAAAYAAJ|archive-date=18 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, [[ibn Saud]], leader of the [[House of Saud]] and the future founder of [[Saudi Arabia]], added a sword to this flag.&lt;ref name=firefly/&gt; The modern [[Flag of Saudi Arabia]] was introduced in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia Flag and Description|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/flags/countrys/mideast/saudiarb.htm|publisher=World Atlas|accessdate=22 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622133420/http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/flags/countrys/mideast/saudiarb.htm|archive-date=22 June 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Flag of Somaliland]] has a horizontal strip of green, white and red with the ''Shahada'' inscribed in white on the green strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James B. Minahan|title=Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups Around the World A-Z|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=9780313076961|page=806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1997 and 2001, the Taliban used a white flag with the ''Shahada'' inscribed in black as the flag of their [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]]. The various [[Black Standard#Jihadist black flag|jihadist black flag]] used by Islamic insurgents since the 2000s have often followed this example. The ''Shahada'' written on a green background has been used by supporters of [[Hamas]] since about 2000. The 2004 [[Constitution of Afghanistan|draft constitution of Afghanistan]] proposed a flag featuring the ''Shahada'' in white script centered on a red background. In 2006, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] designed its flag using the ''Shahada'' phrase written in white on black background. The font used is supposedly similar to the font used as seal on the original letters written on Muhammad's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/isis-flag-apocalypse/406498/|title=How ISIS Got Its Flag|first=William|last=McCants|work=The Atlantic|date=22 September 2015|access-date=23 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123164753/http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/isis-flag-apocalypse/406498/|archive-date=23 November 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Shakers]] arrived in the United States in 1774, they established numerous communities in the late-18th century through the entire 19th century. The first villages organized in [[Upstate New York]] and the [[New England]] states, and, through Shaker missionary efforts, '''Shaker communities''' appeared in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] states. Communities of Shakers were governed by area bishoprics and within the communities individuals were grouped into "family" units and worked together to manage daily activities. By 1836 eighteen major, long-term societies were founded, comprising some sixty families, and many smaller, short-lived communities were established over the course of the 19th century, including two failed ventures into the [[Southeastern United States]] and an urban community in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The Shakers peaked in population by the early 1850s. With the turmoil of the [[American Civil War]] and subsequent [[The Industrial Revolution in the United States|Industrial Revolution]], Shakerism went into severe decline, and as the number of living Shakers diminished, Shaker villages ceased to exist. Some of their buildings and sites have become museums, and many are historic districts under the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The only active community is [[Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village]] in Maine.

==The first Shaker societies==
The first Shaker community was established north of Albany, and was first called "Niskayuna", a rendering of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] name for the land. Later the town they were in was officially named [[Watervliet (town), New York|Watervliet]]. That part of the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of Watervliet is now in the town of [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]] (since 1895), and the name Watervliet is now limited to the [[administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] of [[Watervliet, New York|Watervliet]] (1896). In addition, [[Niskayuna, New York|Niskayuna]] is now the name of a town to the northwest. This has led to some confusion, because many historical accounts refer to them as the Niskayuna Shakers, while others refer to them as Watervliet Shakers. The [[Watervliet Shaker Historic District]] is where Mother Ann Lee was buried.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Stein, '' The Shaker Experience in America'' (1992) pp 10–37&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1780, the missionary work of the Shakers had attracted many new converts. An extensive series of trips throughout New England from 1781 through 1783 brought in followers across the entire region. Converts began appearing in [[New Lebanon, New York|New Lebanon]] and [[Canaan, New York]]; [[Hancock County, Indiana|Hancock]], [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts|Pittsfield]], [[Richmond, Massachusetts|Richmond]], [[Ashfield, Massachusetts|Ashfield]], [[Harvard, Massachusetts|Harvard]], and [[Shirley, Massachusetts]]; and the states of [[Connecticut]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Maine]] (then part of Massachusetts), among other locations.

In 1784, Ann Lee and her brother both died, leaving James Whittaker to lead the faith. By 1787, he too had died, and Joseph Meacham assumed the role as leader. Meacham appointed Lucy Wright of Pittsfield to co-lead, and under their auspices they organized a central Village in New Lebanon, as well as organizing the original settlement of Watervliet. By 1790, the Hancock Village was also organized.

After the formation of the New Lebanon, Watervliet, and Hancock communities, within three years all remaining [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] communities would organize in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Maine.

==Settlement growth==
The Shakers built more than 20 settlements that attracted at least 20,000 converts over the next century.&lt;ref&gt;Priscilla Brewer, ''Shaker Communities, Shaker Lives'' (Hanover, N.H.: University Press of New England, 1986), xx; Stephen J. Stein, ''The Shaker Experience in America'', 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Strict believers in celibacy, Shakers acquired their members through conversion, [[indenturing]] children, and adoption of orphans. Some children, such as [[Isaac N. Youngs]], came to the Shakers when their parents joined, then grew up to become faithful members as adults.&lt;ref&gt;Glendyne R. Wergland, ''One Shaker Life: [[Isaac N. Youngs|Isaac Newton Youngs]], 1793–1865'' (Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2006), chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

As their communities grew, women and men shared leadership of the Shaker communities. Women preached and received revelations as the Spirit fell upon them. Thriving on the religious enthusiasm of the [[Great Awakening|first and second Great Awakenings]], the Shakers declared their messianic, communitarian message with significant response. One early convert observed: "The wisdom of their instructions, the purity of their doctrine, their Christ-like deportment, and the simplicity of their manners, all appeared truly apostolical." The Shakers represent a small but important Utopian response to the gospel. Preaching in their communities knew no boundaries of gender, social class, or education.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Duduit, ''Handbook of Contemporary Preaching'' (Nashville, TN: Broadman Press, 1992). 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Village organization==

===Bishoprics===
Shaker communities were grouped into bishoprics, which were governing units. A ministry resided in the bishopric's primary community. The New Lebanon Bishopric, the primary bishopric unit, was located in New York and included the [[Mount Lebanon Shaker Society]] and the [[Watervliet Shaker Historic District|Watervliet Shaker Villages]].&lt;ref name="Paterwic p. 18" /&gt;

===Family groups===
A Shaker village was divided into groups or "families." The leading group in each village was the Church Family, and it was surrounded by satellite families that were often named for points on the [[compass rose]]. Each village was governed by a leadership team consisting of two men (Elders) and two women (Eldresses).  Shakers lived together as brothers and sisters. Each house was divided so that men and women did most things separately. They used different staircases and doors. They sat on opposite sides of the room in worship, at meals, and in "union meetings" held to provide supervised socialization between the sexes. However, the daily business of a Shaker village required the brethren and sisters to interact. Though there was a division of labor between men and women, they also cooperated in carrying out many tasks, such as harvesting apples, food production, laundry, and gathering firewood.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''The Shaker Experience in America'' p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every family was designed to be self-supporting with its own farm and businesses, but in times of hardship, other Shaker villages pitched in to help the afflicted.

=== Out-families and short-lived missions ===
In addition to the organized communities, other, small "out-families" and very short-lived communities emerged during the history of the Shakers. These included:
* Numerous communities throughout New England: [[Cheshire, Massachusetts|Cheshire]], [[Ashfield, Massachusetts|Ashfield]], [[Richmond, Massachusetts|Richmond,]] [[Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts|Shelburne Falls]], [[Turners Falls, Massachusetts|Turners Falls]], [[Norton, Massachusetts|Norton]], [[Petersham, Massachusetts|Petersham]], [[Grafton, Massachusetts|Grafton]], [[Upton, Massachusetts|Upton]], and [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts|Rehoboth]] in Massachusetts; [[Windham, Connecticut|Windham]], [[Preston, Connecticut|Preston]], [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]], and [[Saybrook, Connecticut|Saybrook]], Connecticut; [[Guilford, Vermont|Guilford]] and [[Pittsford, Vermont|Pittsford]], Vermont; [[Tuftonboro, New Hampshire|Tuftonboro]], New Hampshire. These emerged during the 1780s but were eventually absorbed into the larger Shaker communities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The People Called Shakers: A Search for the Perfect Society|last=Andrews|first=Edward Deming|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|year=1963|isbn=978-0486210810|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=291–292|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J.

==Shaker village tourism==
In the 19th century, hundreds of tourists visited Shaker villages, and many of them later wrote about their experiences there. Outsiders were invariably impressed by Shaker cleanliness, prosperity, and agriculture. Shaker food was delicious, and they were hospitable to outsiders. Shakers had a reputation for honesty and their products were the best of their kind.&lt;ref&gt;Glendyne R. Wergland, ''Visiting the Shakers, 1778–1849''; Glendyne R. Wergland, ''Visiting the Shakers, 1850–1899'' (Clinton, N.Y.: Richard W. Couper Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IseShrineBuilding.jpg|thumb|275 px|A building at Ise Shrine]]
{{Nihongo|'''''Shinmei-zukuri'''''|神明造}} is an ancient Japanese architectural style typical of [[Ise Grand Shrine]]'s ''[[honden]]'', the holiest of [[Shinto shrines]].&lt;ref name="ko"&gt;Encyclopedia of Shinto&lt;/ref&gt; It is most common in [[Mie Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="jashi"&gt;JAANUS&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ancient [[Shinto shrine|shrines]] were constructed according to the style of dwellings ([[Izumo Taisha]])&lt;ref name="YY"&gt;Young &amp; Young (2007:50)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ki33"&gt;Kishida (2008:33)&lt;/ref&gt; or storehouses ([[Ise Grand Shrine]]).&lt;ref name="YY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fc"&gt;Fletcher and Cruickshank (1996:724)&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings had [[gabled roof]]s, raised floors, plank walls, and were [[thatching|thatched]] with reed or covered with [[Chamaecyparis obtusa|hinoki cypress]] bark.&lt;ref name="fc"/&gt; Such early shrines did not include a space for worship.&lt;ref name="YY"/&gt; Three important forms of ancient shrine architectural styles exist: ''[[taisha-zukuri]]'', ''shinmei-zukuri'' and ''[[sumiyoshi-zukuri]]''&lt;ref name="ki34"&gt;Kishida (2008:34)&lt;/ref&gt; They are exemplified by [[Izumo Taisha]], [[Nishina Shinmei Shrine]] and [[Sumiyoshi Taisha]]&lt;ref name="ki35"&gt;Kishida (2008:35)&lt;/ref&gt; respectively and date to before 552.&lt;ref name="ki126"&gt;Kishida (2008:126)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the tradition of {{nihongo|''Shikinen sengū-sai|式年遷宮祭}}'', the buildings or shrines were faithfully rebuilt at regular intervals adhering to the original design. In this manner, ancient styles have been replicated through the centuries to the present day.&lt;ref name="ki33"/&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Ise Shrine Meizukuri.jpg|thumb|left|Ise Shrine's ''honden'']]This style is characterized by an extreme simplicity. Its basic features can be seen in Japanese architecture from the [[Kofun period]] (250–538 C.E.) onwards and it is considered the pinnacle of Japanese traditional architecture.&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt; Built in plane-unfinished wood, the ''honden'' is either 3x2 ''ken'' or 1x1''ken'' in size, has a raised floor, a gabled roof&lt;ref&gt;A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall enclosed between the edges of a sloping roof.&lt;/ref&gt; with an entry on one the non-gabled sides ({{nihongo|''[[hirairi]]'' or ''hirairi-zukuri''|平入・平入造}}), no upward curve at the eaves, and purely decorative logs called ''[[chigi (architecture)|chigi]]'' (vertical) and ''[[katsuogi]]'' (horizontal) protruding from the roof's ridge.&lt;ref name="jashi"/&gt; 

Because shrines used to be rebuilt every 20 years, as Ise Shrine still is, shrines of this type are mostly of recent construction. The oldest extant example is [[Nishina Shinmei Shrine]],&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;[https://archive.is/20121209043808/http://100.yahoo.co.jp/detail/%E7%A5%9E%E7%A4%BE%E5%BB%BA%E7%AF%89/ Jinja Kenchiku], [[Shogakukan]] Nihon Daihyakka Zensho, accessed on November 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; which gives the name to the style.

'''''Sicilian Questions''''' (المسائل الصقلية, al-Masāʼil al-Ṣiqilliyya, in [[Arabic]]) is the name of [[Ibn Sab'in]]'s masterpiece, one of the leading representatives of the [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]]ian [[Sufi|mystic]] of the 13th century. Its doctrines are marked by the influence of two great philosophical areas, the [[Peripateticism]] and [[Sufism]], which makes it a very interesting writing for researchers and scholars. This work contains the answer given by him to some philosophical questions raised by the famous Emperor [[Frederick II of Hohenstaufen]] (1215 -1250) and has been defined as "symbol on the intellectual relations between medieval Christian [[Europe]] and the [[Islamic world]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dario Cabanelas]], "Federico II de Sicilia e Ibn Sab'in de Murcia. Las Cuestiones Sicilianas", ''Miscelánea de Estudios Árabes y Hebraicos'', 4, 1955, pp.48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; 
On the ''Sicilian Questions'' exist, so far, the complete editions of Serefettin Yaltkaya,&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Sab'in, ''al-Kalam 'ala-l-al-Siqiliyya Masa'il'', text published by Serefettin Yaltkaya, Bayrut 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Sab'in, Correspondance philosophique avec l'Empereur Frederic II of Hohenstaufen, Arabic text published by Serefettin Yaltkaya, with Introduction by Henry Corbin, Paris 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; according to the 534th Arabic manuscript from the Bodleian Library at Oxford; and several complete translations: to [[Turkish language|Turkish]],&lt;ref&gt;Serefettin Yaltkaya, ''Sicilya cevaplari Ibni Sabinin Sicilya Krali ikinci Frederikin felsefi sorgularina verdigi cevaplarin tercemesidir'', Istanbul 1934 (full translation into Turkish).&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Italian language|Italian]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrizia Spallino, ''Le questioni siciliane. Federico II e l' universo filosofico'', Introduction, translation and notes, presentation of Aladdin Bakri, Palermo 2002 (full translation into Italian)&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Spanish language|Spanish]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Luisa Arvide]], ''Las Cuestiones Sicilianas'', Introduction, edition, translation and notes, Grupo Editorial Universitario, Granada 2009 (full translation into Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as diverse partial translations: to [[French language|French]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Michele Amari]], "Questions philosophiques adressées aux savants musulmans par l´empereur Frédéric II", ''Journal Asiatique'', 5. série, 1 (1853), pp.240-274 (French translation of fragments).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;August Ferdinand Mehren, "Correspondance du philosophe soufi Ibn Sab´in Abdou l-Haqq avec l´empereur Frédéric II de Hohenstaufen", ''Journal Asiatique'', 7. série, 14 (1879), pp.341-454 (French translation of Question IV)&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Italian language|Italian]],&lt;ref&gt;Mario Grignaschi, "Ibnu Sab´în, Al-Kalâmu ´alâ-l-masâ´ili -ç-çiqiliyyati, Trattato sulle domande siciliane. Domanda II. Traduzione e commento", ''Archivio Storico Siciliano'', 3. série, 7(1955), pp.7-91 (French translation of Question II)&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Spanish language|Spanish]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Dario Cabanelas]], Ofm., "Federico II de Sicilia e Ibn Sab´in de Murcia. Las Cuestiones Sicilianas", en ''Miscelánea de Estudios Árabes y Hebraicos'', 4 (1955), pp.31-64 (Spanish translation of fragments)&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[German language|German]].&lt;ref&gt;Anna Akasoy, ''Die Sizilianischen Fragen'', Freiburg 2005 (fragmentary translation into German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the author's style, the book has obvious signs of eloquence and elegance, as well as extensive scientific knowledge. But at the same time, it warns, sometimes, a certain monotony, excessive rhetoric, with consequent abrupt interruptions retakes, disjunctions, etc. Through its pages the text shows a peculiar mix of Aristotelian influence and Neoplatonic Sufi mysticism, and an overview of the most important doctrines of the science of antiquity, including for instace, the logic of Aristotle.

==Structure==
The treatise is divided into a prologue, wrote perhaps one of his disciples, which explains the origin of the correspondence, the answer to the four philosophical questions raised by [[Frederick II of Hohenstaufen]], a Appendix referred to several issues, and finally, an epilogue. These parts are of variable length and are subdivided, in turn, into several sections. Given, then, that its structure is as follows:

*C.  Epilogue of the work

As usual in medieval Arabic treatises, and how could it be otherwise, if we take into account the rich and highly educated of [[Ibn Sab'in]], in the ''Sicilian Questions'' the author quotes from other writers, especially those in the classical antiquity; among them are, for example, [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' and especially those belonging to the logic of [[Aristotle]], as the most relevant. Similarly, and for the same reason, it makes frequent references to ancient philosophers and thinkers to a greater extent, but also to his fellow followers of other faiths and representatives of the most varied theories and doctrines, explained or simply commented on the work, which make it a rich melting pot of scientific knowledge to justify the time and interest in it. Among all these philosophers, he notes, the volume of citations is made on his thought and his writings, [[Aristotle]], which is really central to the treaty and the Andalusian mystic most often named as the Wise (''al-Hakim'') and the Man (''al-Rayul'').

Other important philosophers and thinkers in the ''Sicilian Questions'' referred to are, in alphabetical order, [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], [[Anaxagoras]], [[Berossus]], [[Crates of Thebes|Crates]], [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]], [[Euclid]], [[al-Farabi]], [[Galen]], [[al-Ghazali]], [[Mansur Al-Hallaj|al-Hallaj]], [[Avempace|Ibn Bajja]] (Avempace), [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Iamblichus]], [[Parmenides]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]], [[Socrates]], [[Themistius]], [[Theophrastus]] and [[Zeno of Elea]].

The masterful character of the work lies at the confluence of all these philosophical currents which combine great diversity of theories and beliefs.

"'''Sinner'''" is a song by American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Drowning Pool]] and is from their debut album [[Sinner (Drowning Pool album)|of the same name]]. Serving as the first track on the album, the song also was released as the third [[single (music)|single]] from the album. It is the last single to feature [[Dave Williams (singer)|Dave Williams]] as lead vocalist before his death the following day.

The track served as the [[theme song]] of the film ''[[The One (2001 film)|The One]]'', starring [[Jet Li]].

This was also the theme song of [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] [[Vengeance (2001)|Vengeance 2001]].

==Music video==
The "Sinner" [[music video]] was filmed in October 2001 and was directed by [[Gregory Dark]]. It was shot in and around an abandoned [[Los Angeles]] motel called the Pink Lady, was inspired by the [[David Fincher]] film ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]''. The video features the band playing in a swimming pool during heavy rain. Footage includes a [[dominatrix]] and pit bulls, a woman who lies in a [[tanning bed]] until her skin becomes leathery, and an obese man sitting in a recliner in front of a TV set. The man continuously gorges on food until finally his belly explodes, his innards splattering all over the room.

Regarding the making of music video, Dave Williams said "They rained on us for four hours straight and it was cold, man. We had to play in the mud. And we didn't sleep for, like, two days because we shot the thing from six at night until eight in the morning. We all got sick, but it was cool." and "There are these scenes with a dominatrix and pit bulls and there are these fat guys exploding and a chick that's been laying in a tanning bed for too long and her skin turns to leather. When we were done shooting, the only things left standing were the prostitutes coming in and out of the motel."&lt;ref&gt;Wiederhorn, Jon [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1450421/20011030/drowning_pool.jhtml "Drowning Pool's Bodies Get Soaked For 'Sinner'"] MTV.com (October 30, 2001). Retrieved on August 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Meaning==
Regarding the song's meaning, vocalist [[Dave Williams (singer)|Dave Williams]] explained, "Every religion has a list ... [[Catholics]] can [[drinking|drink]] and that's OK, but the [[Baptists]] say if you drink you're going to [[Hell]]. Everybody's got that list of what is going to keep you from getting into [[Heaven]], but everybody's broken at least one of those rules, no matter what religion you are ... basically, I'm just saying we're all sinners."

== Description ==
This sketch, painted on paper in black ink with light colouring, depicts two ladies sitting opposite each another, their heads being encircled by [[Halo (religious iconography)|nimbi]]. Both are represented holding various attributes: the lady on the left, who sits on a rectangular throne supported by a row of lotus petals, holds a foliated cup and a tray with a dog seated on it. The one on the right is seated on a dog or wolf, and has four arms, the upper two supporting the sun and moon discs, the lower two arms holding a scorpion and a snake. They wear a characteristic hairstyle, surmounted by a water-drop-shaped or peach-shaped headdresses that are probably made of metal.&lt;ref name=Uygur-Tunhwang /&gt;

== Analysis ==
[[File:Dunhuang mogao mural cave 409.jpg|thumb|190px|The [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] ladies have the same hairstyle. 10th-century fresco at the [[Mogao Caves]].]]
The drawing had been published in [[Jao Tsung-I]]'s ''The Line Drawing of Dunhuang'' in 1978, but has only attracted the interest of researchers since it was displayed in the [[Serindia|Sérinde]] exhibition in 1995.&lt;ref name=Uygur-Tunhwang /&gt;

The peach-shaped headdress resembles the hairstyle of the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] princess. The dress of the lady on the left, at least, does not seem to correspond to the Chinese fashion at the time, and both representing the expression of foreign beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc8830k/cd0e17692 |title=Cote : Pelliot chinois 4518 (24) – Deux divinités féminines |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr |language=fr |access-date=22 November 2018 |quote=Elle ressemble à la coiffure de la princesse ouïghoure.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jiang Boqin ({{lang|zh-Hant|姜伯勤}})—a professor at [[Sun Yat-sen University]]—it is a piece of Zoroastrian art, and the four-armed deity is a Sogdian goddess worshipped in their Zoroastrian cult, whose name is {{lang|ae-Latn|Nanâ|italic=no}}, or Nanaia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nansha.schina.ust.hk/Article_DB/sites/default/files/pubs/Jour-03.2.B02.pdf |title=姜伯勤《中國祆教藝術史》書評 |last=Wu |first=Yu |date=2004 |website=schina.ust.hk |language=zh-Hant |access-date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the goddess originated from [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Gorshenina |first1=Svetlana |author-link1=Svetlana Gorshenina |last2=Rapin |first2=Claude |date=2001 |title=De Kaboul à Samarcande : Les archéologues en Asie centrale |series=Collection "[[Découvertes Gallimard]]" |volume=411 |location=Paris |publisher=Éditions Gallimard |page=107 |chapter=Chapitre 5 : Des Kouchans à l'Islam – La peinture sogdienne |language=fr |isbn=978-2-070-76166-1 |quote=Dans la peinture on rencontre ainsi des versions du ''Panchatantra'', l'histoire de la déesse Nana originaire de Mésopotamie.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frantz Grenet]]—a French specialist on Sogdiana and Zoroastrianism—and the historian [[Zhang Guangda]] argue that the lady on the left representing [[Daēnā]], the good according to Zoroastrian vision; the other one represents [[Daēva]], the bad.&lt;ref name=Zoroastrian-Flame /&gt; Jiang Boqin agrees with Grenet and Zhang that the deity on the left being Daēnā, but he determined the one on the right is the goddess Nanâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://big5.xjass.cn/ls/content/2013-11/22/content_304687.htm |title=敦煌與中外關係史研究三十年 |last=Wang |first=Xusong |date=2013 |website=xjass.cn |language=zh-Hant |access-date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3728">'''Sortes''' ([[Latin]] singular: ''sors'') were a frequent method of [[divination]] among the [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]].&lt;ref name="DGRA"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Smith  | first = William  | author-link = William Smith (lexicographer)  | contribution = Sortes  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 1051–1052  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1870  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/1058.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method involved the [[Cleromancy|drawing of lots]] (''sortes'') to obtain knowledge of future events: in many of the ancient Italian temples the will of the gods was consulted in this way, as at [[Praeneste]] and [[Caere]].&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the meaning of ''sors'' see [[Cicero]], ''[[De Divinatione]]'' ii. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

These ''sortes'' or lots were usually little tablets or counters, made of wood or other materials, and were commonly thrown into a [[Situla (vessel)|sitella or urn]], filled with water.  The lots were sometimes thrown like dice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Tiberius'' 14&lt;/ref&gt;  The name of "sortes" was in fact given to anything used to determine chances,&lt;ref&gt;compare [[Cicero]], ''[[De Divinatione]]'' i. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and was also applied to any verbal response of an oracle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Divinatione]]'' ii. 56 and [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' iv. 346, 377&lt;/ref&gt;

Various things were written upon the lots according to circumstances, as for instance the names of the persons using them. It seems to have been a favorite practice in later times to write the verses of illustrious poets upon little tablets, and to draw them out of the urn like other lots, the verses which a person thus obtained being supposed to be applicable to him (see ''[[Sortes Homerica]]'' and ''[[Sortes Virgilianae]]'', lots created from verses of [[Homer]] and [[Virgil]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned by [[Aelius Lampridius|Lampridius]], ''Alex. Sever.'' 14 and [[Spartianus]], ''Hadr.'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bible|Biblical]] account of the prophet [[Jonah]], he is thrown into the sea and swallowed by the fish after the sailors on the ship cast lots to determine the guilty one who had brought about the storm.&lt;ref&gt;Jonah 1:7&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the practice to consult the poets in the same way as [[Islam|Muslims]] do the [[Koran]] and [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|Hafiz]], and many [[Christian]]s the [[Bible]], namely, by opening the book at random and applying the first passage that struck the eye to a person's own immediate circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], ''Confessions'' iv. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  This practice was very common among the [[early Christians]], who substituted the Bible and the [[Psalter]] for [[Homer]] and [[Virgil]]. Many church councils repeatedly condemned these ''[[Sortes Sanctorum]]'' (sacred lots), as they were called.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', c. xxxviii. note 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sibylline books]] were probably also consulted in this way.  Those who foretold future events by lots were called ''Sortilegi''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]], ix. 581&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''sortes convivales'' were sealed tablets, which were sold at entertainments, and upon being opened or unsealed entitled the purchaser to things of very unequal value. They were therefore a kind of [[lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Octav.'' 75 and Lampridius, ''Heliogab.'' 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the early 1950s, the [[Bahá'í Faith in Australia|Bahá'ís of Australia]] began work to purchase a property for a House of Worship.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hassall|first1=Graham|title=The Bahá'í Faith in Australia: 75 Years Remembered|url=http://bahai-library.com/pdf/h/hassall_75_years_australia.pdf|publisher=Herald of the South|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[persecution of Bahá'ís]] intensified in [[Iran]] in 1955, Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, suspended plans for a House of Worship in [[Tehran]] and commissioned two others in its place, one in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]], and the other in Sydney.&lt;ref name="jrh-hassall"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hassall|first1=Graham|title=The Bahá'í Faith in Australia 1947–1963|journal=Journal of Religious History|date=December 2012|volume=36|issue=4|pages=563–576|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9809.2012.01231.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jorh.2012.36.issue-4/issuetoc|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property for the temple was acquired in 1956.&lt;ref name="jrh-hassall"/&gt; An initial design by [[Mason Remey|Charles Mason Remey]] was given to Sydney architect John Brogan to develop and complete, and construction began in April 1957.&lt;ref name="dict-syd"/&gt; On 22 March 1958, a foundation ceremony was held which was attended by Clara Dunn, a [[Hand of the Cause]] appointed by Shoghi Effendi who first brought the Bahá'í Faith to Australia in 1920 along with her husband John Hyde Dunn.&lt;ref name="bahai-encyc"/&gt;

The temple was dedicated on 16 and 17 September 1961&lt;ref name="bahai-encyc"/&gt; by Shoghi Effendi's widow [[Rúhíyyih Khánum]] (Mary Maxwell),&lt;ref name="univ-local"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Hassall|first=Graham|editor1-last=Cusack|editor1-first=Carole M.|editor1-link=Carole M.

In the summer of 1993–1994&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; and again in 2005–2006, the temple was threatened by nearby bush fires which approached but never reached the temple grounds.&lt;ref name="dict-syd"/&gt; In 2011, a week of events was held to mark the temple's fiftieth anniversary, including an interfaith prayer service, a reception attended by dignitaries such as the [[Premier of New South Wales]], and an exhibition featuring children's art on creating a more peaceful world.&lt;ref name="50anniv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian society 'enriched and ennobled' by Baha'i temple|url=http://news.bahai.org/story/851|publisher=Bahá'í World News Service|accessdate=7 February 2017|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building and grounds==
[[File:Bahai temple sydney.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Interior of the Bahá'í House of Worship]]
On the ground floor of the temple is a main auditorium with seating for six hundred people, encircled by a gallery.&lt;ref name="univ-local"/&gt; From there, nine doors open onto the grounds at equal angles, as in all Bahá'í Houses of Worship, signifying the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion|unity of the world's religions]].&lt;ref name="dict-syd"/&gt; The second level features windows of [[Palladian architecture|Palladian style]] that illuminate the building's interior.&lt;ref name="bahai-encyc"/&gt; A ribbed [[dome]] rises above them, spanning 20 metres horizontally and reaching 38 metres above ground level at its highest point.&lt;ref name="bahai-encyc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="univ-local"/&gt; There is a lantern perched on top of the dome, which was placed there by a helicopter during the construction.&lt;ref name="bahai-encyc"/&gt; Construction materials include crushed quartz,&lt;ref name="bahai-encyc"/&gt; local hardwoods in the interior,&lt;ref name="dict-syd"/&gt; and concrete and marble in the dome.&lt;ref name="jrh-hassall"/&gt;

''The Crescent - a weekly record of Islam in England''&lt;ref&gt;British Newspaper Library ref: BLL01013898565 Title: The Crescent : (A weekly record of Islam in England)&lt;/ref&gt; was originally published weekly in Liverpool from 1893. As such, it can claim to be oldest and first regular publication reflecting and serving the early convert&lt;ref&gt;Convert is the English word most often used for one who embraces a religion after being raised in another faith. A common definition of the word "convert" is to "change from one religion or belief to another." A person is considered to have converted to Islam from the moment he or she sincerely makes this declaration of faith, called the ''shahadah'', and this declaration encompasses their acceptance and belief in the five pillars, or foundations, of Islam and that there is only one God and Creator, referred to as Allah (the word for the name of God in Arabic) and that the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, is His last and final messenger. Converts are sometimes referred to as Reverts as Muslim teaching holds that everyone is Muslim at birth because every child that is born has a natural inclination to goodness and to worship the one true God alone, but his or her parents or society can cause him or her to deviate from the straight path. When someone accepts Islam he/she is considered to revert to his/her original condition.&lt;/ref&gt; and Muslim community within the British Isles, although its readership quickly grew via subscription to a global community. The first edition was published on 14 January 1893 from 32 Elizabeth Street,&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Street now forms part of the Faculty of Medicine at Liverpool University, but his father, Robert Henry Quilliam, a successful watchmaker, was trading from the premises under his father's name Samuel Quilliam&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool, shortly before moving to Brougham Terrace. It was edited by [http://abdullahquilliam.com/ W.H. Abdullah Quilliam] and represented Muslims in England and growing convert community between 1893 and 1908.

A statement in ''The Crescent'' to its advertisers&lt;ref&gt;''The Crescent'' - statement to advertisers in the last edition published on 28 May 1908 from Geneva Road, Liverpool.&lt;/ref&gt; declared that “''in addition to the thousands of copies in circulation within the British Isles, in addition to which thousands of copies of the Paper are sent regularly abroad to subscribers in France, Spain, Switzerland, Constantinople, Smyrna, Syria, Turkey in Asia, Russia, Morocco, Tunis, Algeria, Malta, Egypt, Persia, Beluchistan, Ceylon, Arabia, the Cape Colony, the Transvaal, Zanzibar, Lagos, Gambia, Sierra Leone, the west Coast of Africa, Afghanistan, Penang, Singapore, China, British Guiana, Trinidad, Canada, the United States of America, and many parts of India, this forming a capital advertising medium''”. The advertising rate was stated as being 2s. 6d.&lt;ref&gt;2s. 6d. (two shillings and sixpence, or half a crown) equates to 12.5 pence decimal&lt;/ref&gt; per inch per insertion.

After outgrowing the Muslim prayer hall established by Quilliam in Mount Vernon, Liverpool, in 1888 he rented 8 Brougham Terrace&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-359729-brougham-terrace-8-9-and-10-liverpool 8 Brougham Terrace]&lt;/ref&gt; and also acquired the neighbouring properties, numbers 10 and 12 in 1889, and in the basement a printing press was established to produce the monthly editions of ''The Islamic World'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Islamic World'' - an intermittent monthly publication from 1889 which preceded ''The Crescent'' - ref: ''Islam in Victorian Britain: The Life and Times of Abdullah Quilliam'' {{ISBN|1847740103}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was subscribed to globally. In 1893, it evolved into the weekly publication ''The Crescent - a weekly record of Islam in England''.

Plans were announced for a purpose-built mosque to be built to the design of J. H. McGovern&lt;ref&gt;''The Crescent'' - article 28 March 1900 – ''Proposed mosque in Liverpool''. J.H. McGovern had provided architectural detailed plans for the proposed mosque at the new site and these plans were forwarded to Quilliam in Istanbul in 1898, so that he could submit them to the Sultan, Abdul Hamid II for approval and financial assistance.&lt;/ref&gt; on the site of 10 and 12 [http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/heritage/england/liverpool/article_1.shtml Brougham Terrace], but did not materialise, any more than did those of 1902, for a mosque in the communities new centre at Geneva Road, Elm Park, Liverpool where ''The Crescent'' continued to be published until May 1908.

''The Crescent'' newspaper is a social history of a growing Muslim convert community. Such names as Yahya McQuinn, T. Omar Byrne, [http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/bmh/BMH-fatimacates.htm Fatima Cates], [https://medium.com/@yahyabirt/abdullah-quilliams-obituary-of-yahya-parkinson-1874-1918-697ab7b4df9 Yahya Nasser Parkinson], Nasrullah Warren, J.

==2018 to present==
The Crescent Newspaper was relaunched in 1440 A.H. (September 2018) by British Muslim converts residing in UK and Eire as an [[Online newspaper|on-line newspaper]] with the title '[http://www.thecrescent.online ''The Crescent'' newspaper]'. It appears as both printed&lt;ref&gt;British Library ref: '''ISSN 2517-4975''' - printed edition&lt;/ref&gt; and on-line&lt;ref&gt;British Library ref: '''ISSN 2517-4983''' - electronic edition&lt;/ref&gt; editions. It is planned to publish the paper monthly on the first Friday of each month from the first Friday of the Muslim New Year in Muharrem&lt;ref&gt;Muharram (Arabic: المحرّم) is the first month of the Islamic calendar and marks the start of the Islamic new year.&lt;/ref&gt; 1440, and move to a fortnightly publication thereafter.

'''''To the Stars''''' is an album by American [[jazz fusion]] group the [[Chick Corea Elektric Band]], released on August 24, 2004 by [[Stretch Records]]. [[Jazz]] musician [[Chick Corea]], a longtime member of the [[Church of Scientology]], was inspired by [[Scientology]] founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[science fiction]] 1954 novel ''[[To the Stars (novel)|To the Stars]]''. Hubbard's book tells the story of an interstellar crew which experiences the effects of [[time dilation]] due to traveling at near [[Speed of light|light speed]]. A few days experienced by the ship's crew could amount to hundreds of years for their friends and family back on Earth.

Corea was influenced in particular by a scene from Hubbard's work where one of the main characters plays the piano, and he created the album as a [[tone poem]] piece. It was the first time members of his group Chick Corea Elektric Band had gotten together since 1991. Scientology-owned [[Galaxy Press]] reissued the book at the same time as the album's release as a form of [[marketing co-operation|cross-marketing]]. Corea later produced another album, ''[[The Ultimate Adventure]]'', also inspired by and named after a work by Hubbard.

The album received mostly positive reviews. Christopher Blagg of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' commented: "Somewhere L. Ron Hubbard was smiling," and Mike Hobart of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' described the album as "a fine programme of jazz-fusion". It reached number eight on the U.S. [[Top Contemporary Jazz]] charts in September 2004, and garnered Corea a 2004 [[Grammy Award]] nomination for instrumental arrangement for the track "The Long Passage".

==Inspiration==
{{main|To the Stars (novel)}}

Hubbard's ''To the Stars'' depicts a future where an interstellar ship travelling at near [[Speed of light|light speed]] slows down time experienced for its occupants.&lt;ref name="himes" /&gt; The ship's members are affected by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[time dilation]] theory, and the Earth experiences hundreds of years while only a few days have passed for members of the ship.&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=504861|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]|title=Elektric Band and Chick Corea Resynergize: Jazz great teams up with old band for tour, album with sci-fi literary influence|publisher=The Harvard Crimson, Inc.|accessdate=2008-06-06|date=December 3, 2004|last=Collins|first=James F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew have no family or friends on Earth due to the time that separates them.&lt;ref name="collins" /&gt; Of the album's 17 tracks, 10 are directly based on characters or concepts from the book.&lt;ref name="cober" /&gt; The protagonist of the book (scientist Alan Corday), the ship's captain (Captain Jocelyn), and the ship's name (''Hound of Heaven'') are all titles of tracks on the album.&lt;ref name="himes" /&gt; The other seven tracks are "Port Views", short musical interludes between the larger pieces.&lt;ref name="cober" /&gt;

Corea explains at his website how he was motivated to work on music inspired by ''To the Stars'', commenting that he was inspired by a scene from the book in which Hubbard describes the Captain of the spaceship in the story playing a melody on a piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chickcorea.com/to_the_stars.html|work=Chick Corea - Official Website|title="To The Stars" - The Chick Corea Elektric Band|publisher=www.chickcorea.com|accessdate=2008-06-05|last=Smith|first=Christopher |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080329091001/http://www.chickcorea.com/to_the_stars.html |archivedate = March 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had read the book eight or nine times,&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Young | first =Bob | title = MUSIC - Sci-fi on the hi-fi - Chick Corea in interstellar overdrive after inspiration from L. Ron Hubbard's works | work =[[Boston Herald]] | date =November 20, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and after writing down musical composition based on Hubbard's work the album was created as a [[tone poem]] piece.&lt;ref name="collins" /&gt; Previous tone poem albums by Corea include ''The Leprechaun'' (1975), ''My Spanish Heart'' (1976), and ''The Mad Hatter'' (1978).&lt;ref name="weideman" /&gt; The piece is Corea's first attempt at musical interpretation from one of Hubbard's works.&lt;ref name="collins" /&gt;

"The attraction to me was not only the challenge of writing music portraying characters in a fiction book but the fact that I've had such an intimate connection with L. Ron Hubbard and his work in Scientology for 40 years now. I've been a fan of his fiction for 25 years, and once I started into the act of working with his creations, it had an extra special excitement to me," he said in an interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name="harrington" /&gt; "Aside from the content in his message, and the fact that he's the founder of the Church of Scientology and Dianetics, the thing I loved about Hubbard was the aesthetics of his writing. There is a musical wavelength to what he does," said Corea to ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name="gilbert" /&gt;

==Production==
Corea brought together the original members of Chick Corea Elektric Band for the first time since 1991, including bassist [[John Patitucci]], drummer [[Dave Weckl]], [[saxophone|saxophonist]] [[Eric Marienthal]] and guitarist [[Frank Gambale]].&lt;ref name="himes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A60024-2004Nov18.html|title=CHICK COREA ELEKTRIC BAND "To the Stars" Stretch/Concord|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|accessdate=2008-06-06|date=November 19, 2004 |page=WE07 |last=Himes |first=Geoffrey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gambale's electric guitar playing figures prominently in some of the tracks.&lt;ref name="himes" /&gt; In a statement in ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', Corea commented that ''To the Stars'' represented a synergy of his three greatest passions: "My passion as a composer/performer, my passion for the Elektric Band as a perfect orchestra, and my passion for L. Ron Hubbard as the ideal artist."&lt;ref name="collins" /&gt; The album is his "favorite recording" out of his almost one hundred album discography.&lt;ref name="collins" /&gt;

Mike Manoogian designed the cover and book design for the 2004 hardcover edition of the novel ''To the Stars'', and the artwork is copyrighted by the [[L. Ron Hubbard Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Hubbard | first =L. Ron | authorlink =L.

The novel ''To the Stars'' was reissued by Scientology-owned Galaxy Press at the same time as the album as a form of [[cross-marketing]].&lt;ref name="ratliff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eglash"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Eglash |first1=Ruth |title=Who was L.

Corea's 2004 piece "The Adventures of Hippocrates" was inspired by a robotlike character named "Hippocrates" from Hubbard's science fiction series ''Ole Doc Methuselah''.&lt;ref name="weideman"&gt;{{cite news | last =Weideman | first =Paul | title =KLASSICAL EKCLECTIC CHICK | work =[[The Santa Fe New Mexican]] | page =P27 | date =August 13, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gilbert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040812/news_lz1w12corea1.html|title='This is a very big challenge for me' - Chick Corea 'poured a lot of love and energy' into 'The Adventures of Hippocrates' |work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|publisher=Union-Tribune Publishing Co.|date=August 12, 2004|accessdate=2008-06-06|last=Gilbert|first=Andrew }}&lt;/ref&gt; Corea would go on to compose another album in 2006, ''[[The Ultimate Adventure]]'', also inspired by and named after a book by Hubbard,&lt;ref name="harrington"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/27/AR2006042700728_pf.html|title=Corea's Fresh Riff On an Old Refrain|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]] |accessdate=2008-06-06 |date=April 28, 2006|last=Harrington|first=Richard|page=WE10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which earned him two [[Grammy Award]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Scott | first =Joe | title = Longtime love of music powers pianist Chick Corea | work =Greensboro News &amp; Record | page =GT14 | date =March 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism|terse=1}}
'''Ujukatā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as  "rectitude", and it is the basis for the following pair of [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the [[Theravada]] [[Abhidharma]] teachings:
* ''Kāya-ujukatā'' - rectitude of mental body 
* ''Citta-ujukatā'' - rectitude of consciousness

These two mental factors have the characteristic of uprightness of the mental body and consciousness, respectively.

==Definition==
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2377-2380}}
:Rectitude is straightness. The twofold rectitude has the characteristic of uprightness of the mental body and consciousness, respectively. Its function is to crush tortuousness of the mental body and consciousness, and its manifestation is non-crookedness. Its proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness. It should be regarded as opposed to hypocrisy and fraudulence, etc., which create crookedness in the mental body and consciousness.

Nina van Gorkom explains:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=229}}
:According to the ''[[Dhammasangani]]'' (par 50, 51) this pair of cetasikas consists in straightness and rectitude, being without deflection, twist or crookedness.
:The ''[[Atthasālinī]]'' (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 131) explains that uprightness of cetasikas and of citta crush crookedness and that they are the opponents of the corruptions, such as deception and craftiness, which cause crookedness in mental factors and consciousness.
:Uprightness is the opponent of deception and craftiness.
