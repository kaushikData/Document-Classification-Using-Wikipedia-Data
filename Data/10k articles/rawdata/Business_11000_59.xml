'''42nd Street Photo''', founded in 1965 and located at 15 W 36th Street in [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]], is a 50 years old and one of the first electronics and [[camera]] superstores in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-jensen/hiring-guru-42nd-street-p_b_7693532.html|title=Hiring Guru: 42nd Street Photo Hiring for Over 50 Years|date=2015-06-30|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/sp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;asin=&amp;isAmazonFulfilled=&amp;isCBA=&amp;marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;orderID=&amp;seller=A3AG088RLZBPA&amp;tab=&amp;vasStoreID=|title=Amazon.com Seller Profile: 42nd Street Photo|publisher=|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/urr/listings/stores/42nd_street_photo/|title=42nd Street Photo|publisher=|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.42ndstreetphoto.com/ 42nd Street Photo Blog]. Retrieved 7 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Solomon Barnathan founded 42nd Street Photo in 1965. Barnathan started his own store called ‘Barnett’s’ on 42nd Street, which focused on electronics and cameras. This later became 42nd Street Photo. Elliot Braha took over management of the store from Barnathan in 1985. In 1986, the store expanded to a new location on 5th Avenue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ownership==
The store targets amateur and professional photographers and videographers with low pricing on photography, video and audio equipment. A large portion of the store’s customers comes from their expanding online presence that ships globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/prnewswire/press_releases/2014/04/18/MN06297|title=42nd Street Photo Announces Canon EOS-70D On Sale And Available Now - The Business Journals|website=The Business Journals|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The store is currently owned by Elliot Braha. Braha first started with [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] Photo when it was called Barnett’s, under its previous owner, Solomon Barnathan. Braha moved from being a sales clerk to managing the store in 1985.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In June 2015, Braha was interviewed by David Jensen, author of ''The Naked Interview: Hiring Without Regret'', about his hiring process at 42nd Street Photo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Braha stated that he most values personal references and face-to-face interviews when it comes to hiring employees. Braha attributes their sales increases to the store’s dedication to customer service. Their sales increased 40% from 2009 to 2010, and from 2010 to 2014 they increased 100% from approximately $10 MM to $20 MM.

'''Anna Santisteban''' (November 3, 1914 &amp;ndash; May 18, 2003) was a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] businesswoman and beauty entrepreneur who presided the [[Miss Puerto Rico]] beauty pageant.  This beauty contest was in charge of selecting the Puerto Rican delegate to compete for the title of [[Miss Universe]], though other of its participants represented the Caribbean island in many other beauty competitions as well.

==Career==
Santisteban's finishing school and modeling academy, Polianna, quickly became a landmark for all aspiring models in the island during the 1960s. She was famous for referring to her students as "my girls", her personal approach to training making her a mother figure for many runway and TV models at that time. 

After the success of her first beauty enterprise, in 1962 Santisteban received an offer to produce the Miss Puerto Rico competition, a duty she took with serious intention. Her commitment paid off in 1970, when [[Marisol Malaret]], a 20-year-old executive secretary, became the very first Puerto Rican to hold the coveted title of Miss Universe.

Malaret's triumph injected Santisteban with enthusiasm, especially when Idalia (Beba) Franco arrived as third runner-up in the 1971 international competition. One year later, in 1972, Puerto Rico became the first territory to host both the Miss USA and the Miss Universe pageants. These events meant the beginning of a new era for both Santisteban and her second husband, graphic designer Edward (Eddie) Ortiz.  They founded and established the Miss Puerto Rico Organization, which produced the annual competition that promptly became one of the most commented television events in the island.

Under Santisteban's close supervision, many Miss Puerto Rico titleholders became TV personalities, international models and business leaders.  Some of her detractors have said that Santisteban was a very strict trainer and a very ambitious woman. She neither confirmed nor denied this fact, always focused on her duties with superb elegance and great passion to win another international crown. Santisteban's eagerness had to wait until 1985, when [[Deborah Carthy-Deu]] won the second Miss Universe title for her country. After that second triumph, Puerto Rico scored remarkable positions in both the semifinal and final rounds of this competition.

In 1993, [[Dayanara Torres]] became Santisteban's third and last winner for the Miss Universe Pageant. Two years later, at the age of 81, Santisteban was the oldest national director for the organization but was inexplicably removed from her duties, a bold move that many people interpreted as age-discriminatory.

With first husband Luis Pedreira, Santisteban had three sons, Walter, Luis and Alberto, the youngest, who died in an accident. When Ortiz, her second husband and business partner, died in 2000, she suffered a fall and was removed from her Art-Deco home in the upmarket [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] area known as ''Ocean Park'', to a long-term care nursing home named ''Hogar Santa Teresa de Jornet''.

==Death==
On May 18, 2003, Santisteban died at the ''Pavía Hospital'' in Santurce, Puerto Rico after battling a long illness.

'''Brazilian Silicon Valley''' is a term commonly applied to the region of [[Campinas]] and in southern region this term is applied for [[Florianópolis]] city, [[Brazil]] because of its similarity to the 'original' [[Silicon Valley]], located in [[California]] in the [[United States|USA]].

==Characteristics==

Campinas has gained this distinction because it has several comparable features, such as:

*It is a modern city, located near a giant [[metropolis]], [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]]
*It has a vibrant, [[high-tech]] [[university]] and [[research]] environment, composed of the University of Campinas ([[UNICAMP]]), the Pontificial Catholic University of Campinas ([[PUCCAMP]]), the FACAMP, the UNISAL (Centro Universitário Salesiano de São Paulo), the Center for Research and Development in Telecommunications ([[CPqD]]), the [[National Laboratory of Synchrotron Light]], the [[Renato Archer Research Institute]] (CenPRA), the Brazilian Company of Agricultural Research ([[EMBRAPA]]), the [[Agronomical Institute of Campinas]], the Biological Institute, the Food Technology Institute, the [[Eldorado Institute]], the [[Werner von Braun Institute]] and several others. Campinas boasts a researcher/population ratio equal to those of the most advanced technology centers.
*A number of high-tech, non-pollutant electrical and [[electronics]] industries have settled around Campinas, such as [[IBM]], [[Lucent]], [[Samsung]], [[Nortel]], [[Compaq]], [[Freescale Semiconductor]], [[Motorola]], [[Dell]], [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], [[Huawei]], [[3M]], [[Texas Instruments]], [[Celestica]], [[Solectron]], and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]].
*Several [[industrial park]]s and [[business incubator|incubator]]s for high tech companies in the fields of [[microelectronics]], [[computers]], [[software]], [[telecommunications]], etc. have developed there.

==History==
Until the 1970s, the Campinas region had few industries and had an [[Economic system|economy]] based on [[agriculture]] and in the services and [[commerce]] sectors. With the foundation of UNICAMP and the ready availability of high-quality [[researcher]]s, [[engineer]]s and [[student]]s focused on [[physics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[computer sciences]], [[mathematics]], [[mechanical engineering]], etc., a number of high-tech companies started to establish their industrial plants and [[R&amp;D]] labs nearby, such as [[IBM]]. The municipality of Campinas and those surrounding it began to foster actively the growth of this new area, and the CIATEC I and II ([[Companhia de Desenvolvimento do Pólo de Alta Tecnologia de Campinas]]) industrial zones were established around the university campus, in the subdistrict of [[Barão Geraldo]]. The Center for Research and Development (CPqD) set up by [[Telebras]], a state holding for the [[telecommunications]] industry in Brazil, which had grown enormously under the military regime umbrella, was the second boost to Campinas Silicon Valley. A law was passed by the Federal government, protecting Brazilian-made technology against imports, and this resulted in further growth. Together with UNICAMP researchers a number of pioneering developments occurred in the brand-new areas of [[laser]]s, [[fiber optics]], [[digital telephony]], [[computer]] technology, [[software]] development, and so on. In addition, the [[Petrobras]] state-owned [[Petroleum|oil]] giant was starting to develop a long range oil exploration program with the aim of making Brazil independent of oil imports, a policy also started by the military for strategic and economic reasons (the [[1979 energy crisis|oil shock]] had deeply affected the country), and UNICAMP was one of the leading research universities to participate. In this respect, UNICAMP's open philosophy of collaboration with the private sector (unheard of in Brazil until that time), established by his visionary founder and first rector, Dr. [[Zeferino Vaz]], prepared the way for a unique synergy between industry and university.

==Other areas==
Other areas in Brazil are also claiming a similar status to Campinas Silicon Valley, although they are much less organized and with smaller companies. They are:
* [[Araraquara]] and [[São Carlos]], [[State of São Paulo]], with a high technology industries and [[University of São Paulo]] - USP, [[Federal University of São Carlos]] - UFSCar and [[Universidade Estadual Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho]] - UNESP.
* [[Recife]], state of [[Pernambuco]], with a budding Digital Port and many collaborative ties with the [[Universidade Federal de Pernambuco]]
* The Vale do [[Sapucaí River (Minas Gerais)|Sapucaí]] in Minas Gerais, with several cities (such as [[Santa Rita do Sapucai]]) where collaboration between high-tech industries and universities (such as [[INATEL]]) is generally recognized as one of the best examples of a nascent Silicon Valley.
* [[Belo Horizonte]], state of [[Minas Gerais]], not properly a Silicon Valley because it has mostly a software industry, but the upcoming [[BHTec]] along with possible semiconductor industry developments in its metropolitan area (specifically, in [[Confins]]) could change this situation.
* [[Florianópolis]], state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], also has mostly a software industry.
* The cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Porto Alegre]], [[Curitiba]], [[Blumenau]] and [[Londrina]], all in the Southeast and South, have also a strongly developed digital economy.

'''Business metadata''' is data that adds business context to other data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It provides information authored by business people and/or used by business people.  It is in contrast to [[technical metadata]], which is data used in the storage and structure of the data in a [[database]] or system. Technical metadata includes the database table name and column name, data type, indexes referencing the data, [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] jobs involving the data, when the data was last updated, accessed, etc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Concept ==
According to noted author and columnist Lowell Fryman, "The essence of business metadata is in reducing or eliminating the barriers of communication between human and human, as well as human and computer, so that the data conveyed from reports, information systems, or business intelligence applications can be crystal clear, can facilitate business operations, and can be leveraged for all business decision-making processes."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/news/2240111047/What-is-metadata-Solutions-for-leveraging-technical-and-business-metadata|title=What is metadata? Solutions for leveraging technical and business metadata|work=SearchDataManagement|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Linstedt, creator of the [[Data vault modeling|Data Vault]] methodology, says business metadata "...provide[s] definition of the functionality, definition of the data, definition of the elements, and definition of how the data is used within business...business metadata includes business requirements, time-lines, business metrics, business process flows, and business terminology."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/blogs/linstedt/archives/2006/07/technical_versu.php|title=Technical versus Business Metadata - classifications - Blog: Dan E. Linstedt - BeyeNETWORK|website=www.b-eye-network.com|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business metadata is important because it can greatly facilitate the usefulness of the data to business people.  A simple example of business metadata is a glossary entry.  Hover functionality in an application or web form can enable a glossary definition to be shown when cursor is on a field or term.

Other examples of business metadata include annotation ability within applications.  For example, a business user may be viewing a [[business intelligence]] (BI) report and notice a trend in the data.  The user may have background knowledge as to why this trend occurs.  Some business intelligence tools enable the user to create an annotation within the report that explains the trend.  Such an annotation can enhance other users' understanding of the data.  This example is especially powerful because it is created by a business user for the use of other business people.

== Examples ==
Other examples of business metadata are:
* Business rules
* Data quality rules
* Valid values for reference data
* Wikis 
* Collaboration software

'''Cain Hoy Stable''' was a [[Thoroughbred]] [[stable|racing stable]] and [[horse breeding]] operation with training facilities in [[Columbia, South Carolina]] and [[Kissimmee, Florida]]. It was owned by [[Harry Frank Guggenheim|Harry Guggenheim]] who also raced horses in [[Europe]]. A founding member of the [[New York Racing Association]], Guggenheim began racing in 1929 and originally raced as the '''Falaise Stable''', the name of his [[Long Island, New York]] estate. In 1943 he renamed it the Cain Hoy Stable for his Cain Hoy Plantation, a {{convert|15000|acre|km2|adj=on}} timber and cattle plantation near [[Wando, South Carolina|Wando]], [[South Carolina]].

The stable's racing colors were blue and white blocks with white sleeves and cap. In 1959, Cain Hoy Stable led all American owners in earnings.

Among the [[jockey]]s who rode for Cain Hoy Stable were [[Henry Moreno]], [[Manuel Ycaza]] and [[Braulio Baeza]]. [[Horse trainer|Trainers]] who worked for the stable included [[Frank A. Bonsal]],  [[Moody Jolley]], [[Loyd Gentry, Jr.]], [[Eddie Hayward]], [[William Ward Stephens|William W. Stephens]] and [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|U.S. Racing Hall of Fame]] inductees, [[Angel Penna, Sr.]] and [[Woody Stephens]].

Cain Hoy Stable owned the mare Anchors Aweigh, the dam of Never Bow, Make Sail, Sheet Anchor, as well as the mare Siama who was the Kentucky Broodmare of the Year in 1960 and dam of [[Bald Eagle (horse)|Bald Eagle]], [[One-Eyed King]], and Dead Ahead. Cain Hoy was part of a 1959 breeding syndicate that purchased [[Belmont Stakes]] winner, [[Cavan (horse)|Cavan]]. The stable won numerous important [[graded stakes race]]s including the [[Kentucky Oaks]], [[Alabama Stakes]], and [[Champagne Stakes (United States)|Champagne Stakes]] on three occasions, and the then prestigious [[Futurity Stakes (USA)|Belmont Futurity]] and [[Withers Stakes]], twice. Cain Hoy had six horses won ran in the [[Kentucky Derby]]. They won the 1953 edition with [[Dark Star (horse)|Dark Star]], handing the future Hall of Famer [[Native Dancer]] the only defeat of his career. Their next best Derby finish came in 1963 when [[Never Bend]] finished second.

Cain Hoy bred and raced [[Ack Ack (horse)|Ack Ack]], the 1971 [[Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year|Horse of the Year]] and a U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee. The stable also bred American multiple stakes winner [[Bold Reason]] as well as the [[filly]] [[San San (horse)|San San]] who was sold to [[Margit Batthyany|Countess Margit Batthyany]] in France and who won the 1972 [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]].

Other successful horses included:
* [[Bald Eagle (horse)|Bald Eagle]] – back-to-back winner of the [[Washington, D.C. International Stakes|Washington, D.C. International]], 1960 [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding Older Male Horse|Champion Handicap Male]] 
* [[Lalun (horse)|Lalun]] - won [[Kentucky Oaks]], [[Beldame Stakes]], dam of [[Bold Reason]] and [[Never Bend]]
* [[Never Bend]] – 1962 [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding 2-Year-Old Male Horse|Champion 2-year-old Male]], sire of the 1971 [[Epsom Derby]] winner and [[European Horse of the Year]], [[Mill Reef]]
* [[One-Eyed King]] - multiple stakes winner including back-to-back wins in the [[Donn Handicap]]
* [[Turn-To]] - purchased in [[Ireland]], multiple U.S. stakes winner, Leading Juvenile Sire in the U.S. in 1958, sire of [[Hail to Reason]]

In failing health, in January 1970 the elderly Harry Guggenheim sold Cain Hoy's bloodstock at a dispersal sale. The records of Cain Hoy Stables are part of the Harry Guggenheim papers at the United States' [[Library of Congress]].

'''The Campbell''' (formerly '''The Campbell Apartment''') is a bar and cocktail lounge in [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]]. The space was once the office of American financier [[John W. Campbell (financier)|John W. Campbell]], a member of the [[New York Central Railroad]]'s board of directors. Later used for office space, as a studio by CBS Radio &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All the history that’s going to die with the Campbell Apartment|url=https://nypost.com/2016/06/30/all-the-history-thats-going-to-die-with-the-campbell-apartment/ |newspaper=The New York Post |date=June 30, 2016|accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a jail by [[Metro-North Railroad]], the space was restored to its original opulence following renovations totaling nearly $2 million in 1999 and 2007. Temporarily closed in 2016 after a change in management, the bar was reopened in 2017.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713235950/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/07/campbell_apartment_club.php|title=Grand Central's Campbell Apartment Being Taken Over By Nightclub Group: Gothamist|date=2017-07-13|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in the southwestern corner of the Grand Central Terminal building — above the corner of [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] and [[Vanderbilt Avenue (Manhattan)|Vanderbilt Avenue]] — the space is reached by a staircase from the Balcony Level. It was first leased in 1923 by John Campbell from [[William Kissam Vanderbilt II]], whose family built the Terminal. The {{convert|3500|sqft|m2|sing=on}} space was a single room {{convert|60|ft|m}} long by {{convert|30|ft|m}} wide with a {{convert|25|ft|m|sing=on}} ceiling and an enormous faux fireplace in which Campbell kept a steel safe. At that time, it was the largest ground floor space in Manhattan. Campbell commissioned [[Augustus N. Allen]], an architect known for designing estates on [[Long Island]] and town houses in Manhattan, to build an opulent office, transforming the room into a 13th-century [[Florentine School|Florentine]] palace with a hand-painted [[plaster of paris]] ceiling, leaded windows, and a mahogany balcony with a [[quatrefoil]] design.&lt;ref name="chief executive"&gt;{{cite news |title=From Corner to Community - Transformation of CEO Office Space |first=Margie |last=Goldsmith |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4070/is_2001_August/ai_78805396/ |magazine=The Chief Executive |date=August 2001 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian carpet that took up the entire floor was said to have cost $300,000, or roughly $3.5 million today. Campbell added a piano and pipe organ, and at night turned his office into a reception hall, entertaining 50 or 60 friends who came to hear famous musicians play private recitals. He had a butler named Stackhouse.&lt;ref name="chief executive"/&gt;

After Campbell's death in 1957, the rug and other furnishings disappeared from his office and the space eventually became a signalman's office and later a closet at Grand Central, where the transit police stored guns and other equipment. It also became a small jail, in the area of the present-day bar.&lt;ref name="nyt-2007-03-05"&gt;{{cite news |title=Threadbare to Quite Posh, in Just 12 Hours |first=Anthony |last=Ramirez |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/05/nyregion/05campbell.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 5, 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After falling into disrepair, the space was restored and renovated in 1999. The walls and ceiling were brought back to their former glory and the original steel safe, once hidden behind a wall, now sits in the massive fireplace as a reminder of Campbell's wealth. The new bar is done in the same quatrefoil mahogany style as the balcony. The renovation cost an estimated $1.5 million.&lt;ref name="nyt-2007-03-05"/&gt; A 2006 renovation replaced a largely blue palette with a largely red one, including new carpet, bar stools and chairs. To avoid closing for even one night it took place in less than 12 hours and cost $350,000.&lt;ref name="nyt-2007-03-05"/&gt;

The Campbell Apartment lost its lease in June 2016 after a protracted battle with its landlord and closed its doors at the end of July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/news/a6854/campbell-apartment-grand-central/|title=A Complete History of the Campbell Apartment|date=2016-07-06|work=Town &amp; Country|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bar reopened in May 2017, renamed The Campbell.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These sectors include agriculture and food security, corporate partnerships, democracy and governance, economic growth, education and youth, environment and natural resources, gender equality, social inclusion, health, peace and stability, supply chain solutions, and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://seepnetwork.org/Member-Details/chemonics-international|title=Member Details|website=seepnetwork.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its headquarters in Washington, D.C., the company also has project offices in different countries, covering Asia, Africa, Eurasia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.devex.com/organizations/chemonics-international-inc-1492|title=Chemonics International Inc. {{!}} Devex|website=www.devex.com|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Chemonics was founded in 1975 by Thurston F. (Tony) Teele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20168-2005Apr1.html |title=Obituaries |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=2005-04-02 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Chemonics has been subject to criticism from the [[US Agency for International Development]] (USAID) [[Office of Inspector General, U.S. Agency for International Development|Office of Inspector General]] (OIG) for their work on several multimillion-dollar aid contracts.

In 2012 Chemonics came under scrutiny by the OIG for their work in Haiti after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]]. Chemonics was the largest single recipient of post-earthquake funds from USAID, receiving over $196 million in contracts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/haiti-aid-accountability-2013-04.pdf|title = Breaking Open the Black Box|date = April 2013|accessdate = 2015-04-25|website = |publisher = Center for Economic and Policy Research|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; many of which were "no-bid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.cleveland.com/world/index.ssf/2010/12/outsourcing_quake_assistance_h.html|title = Outsourcing quake assistance: Haitian contractors get only 1.6% of U.S. aid|last = Mendoza|first = Martha|date = 2010-12-12|work = |access-date = 2015-04-25|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audits specifically cited Chemonics lack of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan and that "some of the performance indicators Chemonics developed were not well-defined."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/audit-reports/1-521-12-009-p.pdf|title = Audit of USAID's Haiti Recovery Initiative Activities Managed By Office of Transition Initiatives|date = 2012-09-26|accessdate = 2015-04-25|website = |publisher = US Agency for International Development Office of Inspector General|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemonics also spent more than 75 percent of program budgets on material and equipment when an expenditure of only 30 percent was planned.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/audit-reports/1-521-10-009-p.pdf|title = Audit of USAID's Cash-for-Work Activities in Haiti|date = 2010-09-24|accessdate = 2015-04-25|website = |publisher = US Agency for International Development Office of Inspector General|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Inspector General's report also found that local communities were not sufficiently involved with Chemonics' work and stated "Chemonics used contractors from [[Port-au-Prince]] to implement a number of activities in [[Cap-Haitien]] and [[Saint-Marc]]; these contractors brought their own people to do the jobs instead of hiring locals."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When locals were required by USAID, Chemonics' policies "limited the transparency of the selection process and increase the risk of corruption or favoritism by granting decision-making authority to a few individuals."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In November 2006, USAID Afghanistan awarded a $62 million contract to Chemonics, with an expected end date of March 2010. A 2008 audit of the contract by OIG found that Chemonics' "results fell considerably short of intended results" and "buildings constructed by Chemonics’ subcontractors were not acceptable because of significant construction defects."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/audit-reports/5-306-08-009-p.pdf|title = Audit of USAID/Afghanistan's Accelerating Sustainable Agriculture Program|date = 2008-08-08|accessdate = 2015-04-25|website = |publisher = US Agency for International Development Office of Inspector General|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, A Department of Labor investigation into Chemonics’ hiring practices found that the group discriminated against applicants based on race while trying to fill entry-level positions. According to the Guardian, none of the 124 Black Americans who applied for the jobs in Chemonics International’s regional business units were hired. Chemonics agreed to pay $482,243 to job applicants who were subjected to racial discrimination in the company’s hiring process, the Guardian reported.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/nov/21/top-us-government-aid-partner-to-pay-500k-damages-to-african-american-job-applicants?CMP=twt_gu&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics_of_New_Zealand}}
The '''Commerce Commission''' is a [[New Zealand]] government agency charged with enforcing legislation that promotes [[Competition (economics)|competition]] in the country's [[Market (economics)|market]]s and prohibits misleading and deceptive conduct by traders.  It is an independent, quasi-judicial body, established under the [[Commerce Act 1986]]. The purpose of the Act is to promote competition in [[Economy of New Zealand|New Zealand's economy]]. It prohibits conducts that restricts competition (restrictive trade practices) and the purchase of a business's [[shares]] or [[assets]] if that purchase leads to a substantial lessening of competition in the market.

==Introduction==
The Commission is accountable to the Minister of Commerce and Associate Minister of Commerce for its performance. It is intended to be an independent and impartial promoter and enforcer of the law, with a purpose of achieving the best possible outcomes in competitive and regulated markets for the long-term benefit of New Zealanders.

The Commission undertakes investigations and where appropriate, takes court action.  It considers applications for authorisation in relation to [[anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive behaviour]] and [[mergers]].

The Commission also enforces pieces of legislation specific to the [[telecommunication]]s, [[dairy]] and [[electric power industry|electricity]] industries.

==Specific roles of the Commerce Commission==
The Commerce Commission has specific roles under various Acts, as follows:

===Fair Trading Act 1986===
The [[Fair Trading Act 1986]] was developed with the Commerce Act to encourage competition and to protect consumers from misleading and deceptive conduct and unfair trading practices. The Act applies to all aspects of the promotion and sale of [[goods and services]] – from advertising and pricing to sales techniques and finance agreements.

The Act also applies to [[pyramid schemes]], and provides for consumer information standards covering country of origin (clothing and footwear labelling, fibre content labelling, care labelling and supplier information notices relating to [[motor vehicles]]. The Commission also enforces six product [[safety standards]] relating to [[baby walkers]], pedal [[bicycles]], [[flammability]] of children’s night clothes, [[cigarette lighters]], household cots and toys for children aged up to three years.

===Dairy Industry Restructuring Act 2001===
The Commission has both enforcement and adjudication roles under the [[Dairy Industry Restructuring Act 2001]]. The Act provides for the Commission to undertake enforcement action and requires the Commission to issue determinations to resolve disputes between [[Fonterra]] and other parties.

===Telecommunications Act 2001===
The Telecommunications Act 2001 regulates the supply of telecommunications services in New Zealand. It requires the Commission to make determinations in respect of designated access and specified services and to undertake costing and monitoring activities relating to the Telecommunications Service Obligations.

===Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003===
The Commission assumed responsibility for enforcing the major provisions of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 on 1 April 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0052/latest/whole.html |title=Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 No 52 (as at 30 August 2011), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation  |work=legislation.govt.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act repealed the Credit Contracts Act 1981 and the Hire Purchase Act 1971, placing obligations on [[creditor]]s with respect to disclosure requirements; calculation of fees, charges and [[interest]]; and oppressive conduct. It also enables consumers to seek reasonable changes to credit contracts on the grounds of unforeseen hardship. The part of the Act which relates to oppressive contracts known as buy-back transactions was enacted on 14 October 2003 and was already enforced by the Commission prior to April 2005.

In 2011, former [[National Finance]] director and convicted fraudster [[Trevor Allan Ludlow]] was the first person to be indefinitely banned by the Commission from working in the consumer finance industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/6093053/Ludlow-banned-from-finance-industry |title=Ludlow banned from finance industry |work=stuff.co.nz |year=2011 |quote=Convicted fraudster Trevor Allan Ludlow has become the first person to be banned from working in the consumer finance industry under the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act.  |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartel leniency policy==
The Commission has a [[cartel]] leniency policy to assist in the investigation of anti-competitive arrangements between competitors that are often secret and difficult to detect. The Commission wishes to encourage those involved in cartel conduct to report the cartel to the Commission. The Commission will grant immunity from Commission-initiated proceedings to the first person involved in a cartel to come forward with information and formally apply for leniency, provided they co-operate fully with the Commission in its investigation and prosecution of the cartel.

The leniency policy applies to arrangements between competitors which substantially lessen competition. It does not include conduct which amounts to a company taking advantage of a substantial degree of market power.

==Regulated industries==
The Commerce Commission has a role in the regulation of some markets where there is little or no competition.  The markets where the Commission is currently involved include: electricity transmission and distribution, gas transmission and distribution, telecommunications, airports and the dairy industry.  The Commerce Act Part 4 contains specific provisions for regulation in these markets with a purpose of promoting outcomes that are consistent with outcomes produced in competitive markets such that suppliers of regulated goods or services:
* have incentives to innovate and to invest, including in replacement, upgraded, and new assets; and
* have incentives to improve efficiency and provide services at a quality that reflects consumer demands; and 
* share with consumers the benefits of efficiency gains in the supply of the regulated goods or services, including through lower prices; and
* are limited in their ability to extract excessive profits

===Input methodologies===
The regulatory frameworks are defined using input methodologies that establish the rules, requirements, and processes applying to the regulation, or proposed regulation, of goods or services under Part 4 of the Commerce Act 1986.  The input methodologies typically cover the approach used to evaluate or determine cost of capital, valuation of assets, allocation of common costs, pricing methodologies, regulatory processes and rules, and the criteria that the Commerce Commission will use to evaluate any proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comcom.govt.nz/input-methodologies-2/|title=Input Methodologies|publisher=Commerce Commission |accessdate= 14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission members==
Commission members are appointed for their knowledge of, and experience in, areas relevant to the Commission’s interests. The Commission comprises a chair, deputy chair, and up to three members. The Telecommunications Act created the position of Telecommunications Commissioner. Associate members and up to two cease and desist members may also be appointed.

The current members are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comcom.govt.nz/commission-members/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cor Boonstra''' ([[Leeuwarden]], 7 January 1938) is mainly known as president of the Board of Directors of [[Philips]] (1996–2001).

== Biography ==

At the age of 16, he quit his study at the [[Hogere burgerschool]] and started to work for [[Unilever]]. In 1974 he started to work for [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]], where he ultimately became the president of the board of directors.

On 31 December 1993 he withdrew from Sara Lee.&lt;ref&gt;FEM Business &amp; Finance: ''FEM top 100 most powerful officials'', [http://www.fembusiness.nl/web/Mensen/Persoon.htm?dbid=114&amp;typeofpage=66524 ''Cor Boonstra''] (Dutch website - link broken)&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of 1994 he was asked by former Philips top executive [[Jan Timmer]] to participate in the Board of Directors of Philips, to breathe new life to the brand Philips. Boonstra was responsible for the 'Let's make things better'- campaign.

Two years after his commencement of employment with Philips, Boonstra became the successor of Timmer as the president of the board of directors. He held this leading position until 2001.&lt;ref&gt;NRC Handelsblad, E. van der Walle, [http://www.nrc.nl/W2/Nieuws/2000/08/30/Eco/01.html ''Boonstra maakte Philips welvarend''], 30 August 2000&lt;/ref&gt; While Boonstra was in charge, the market-value of Philips increased fivefold mainly by focusing on short-term profits and selling off company units like BSO/Origin (now a part of [[Atos]] and record company [[PolyGram]]. During his leadership he moved the head office (the top 350 employees) of Philips from [[Eindhoven]] to [[Amsterdam]], the capital of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscenter.philips.com/main/standard/about/news/press/archive/2001/article-2105.wpd ''Philips headquarters to move'']&lt;/ref&gt; Since most of the regular staff remained in Eindhoven, the birthplace of the company, this move was not popular among Philips employees. In 2000 Boonstra was chosen 'top executive of the year'.&lt;ref&gt;FEM Business &amp; Finance: ''Cor Boonstra'', [http://www.fembusiness.nl/web/Mensen/Persoon.htm?dbid=114&amp;typeofpage=66524 ''FEM top 100 most powerful officials''] (Dutch website - link broken)&lt;/ref&gt; Boonstra divorced two times, and has two children (Cor Boonstra and Roelof Boonstra) of his first wife.

In 1998 Boonstra and his first wife barely survived a hijacking. At that time Boonstra already was having an affair with [[Sylvia Tóth]]. A few years later, Boonstra was accused of insider trading in which he allegedly earned several hundreds of thousands of euros by trading in [[Endemol]] shares (where Sylvia Tóth was a member of the board) just before that company was acquired by the Spanish [[Telefónica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volkskrant.nl/economie/toth-werd-dag-voor-handel-boonstra-ingelicht~a756443/ ''Tóth werd dag voor handel Boonstra ingelicht'']&lt;/ref&gt; Boonstra was ultimately acquitted in court as no hard evidence existed that his partner Tóth had shared the information on the impending deal with him. The Dutch press referred to the inside deal as the "pillow talk deal".

A few months later Cor Boonstra was again charged for not reporting trading in [[Ahold]] shares where he himself was a member of the board. He was found guilty and charged a 135.000 euro fine.

[[File:Customs-House-Brisbane-2.jpg|thumb|250px|The Customs House in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]]]

A '''custom house''' or '''customs house''' was a building housing the offices for the government officials who processed the paperwork associated with importing and exporting goods into and out of a country.  Customs officials also collected [[customs (tax)|customs duty]] on imported goods.

The custom house was typically located in a [[seaport]] or in a city on a major river, with access to the ocean.  These cities acted as a [[port of entry]] into a country.  The government stationed officials at such locations to collect taxes and regulate commerce.

Due to advances in electronic information systems, the increased volume of international trade, and the introduction of air travel, the term "custom house" is now often an historical anachronism.  There are many examples of buildings around the world that were formerly used as custom houses but have since been converted for other uses, such as museums or civic buildings.

In the [[United Kingdom]], since 1386, the phrase ''custom house'' has been in use over the term ''customs house''.  This was after a "[[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]]" was erected at Wool Wharf in [[Tower (ward)|Tower Ward]], to contain just the officials of the Great Custom on Wool and Woolfells.  The singular form was used even though in later years the Custom House was the location of other Customs officials as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Smith, Graham |date=1980|title=Something To Declare|page=6|publisher=Harrap &amp; Co.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15032">[[Image:Goalandprocess.JPG|thumb|280px|Example of EEML Goal modeling and process modeling.]]
'''Extended Enterprise Modeling Language''' ('''EEML''') in [[software engineering]] is a [[modelling language]] used for [[Enterprise modelling]] across a number of layers.

==Overview==
Extended Enterprise Modeling Language (EEML) is a modelling language which combines [[structural modelling]], [[business process modelling]], [[goal modelling]] with goal hierarchies and [[resource modelling]]. It was intended to bridge the gap between goal modelling and other modelling approaches. According to Johannesson and Söderström (2008) "the process logic in EEML is mainly expressed through nested structures of tasks and decision points. The sequencing of tasks is expressed by the flow relation between decision points. Each task has an input port and the output port being decision points for modeling process logic".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johannesson and Eva Söderström (2008) .''Information Systems Engineering''. p.58-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

EEML was designed as a simple language, making it easy to update models. In addition to capturing tasks and their interdependencies, models show which roles perform each task, and the tools, services and information they apply.

==History==
Extended Enterprise Modeling Language (EEML) is from the late 1990s, developed in the EU project EXTERNAL as extension of the Action Port Model (APM) by S. Carlsen (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Carlsen, S. (1998). "Action port model: A mixed paradigm conceptual workflow modeling language". In: ''Proceedings of Third IFCIS Conference on Cooperative Information Systems'' (CoopIS'98), New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The EXTERNAL project &lt;ref&gt;EXTERNAL EXTERNAL - ''Extended Enterprise Resources, Networks And Learning'', EU Project,
IST-1999-10091,&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to "facilitate inter-organisational cooperation in knowledge intensive industries. The project worked on the hypothesis that interactive process models form a suitable framework for tools and methodologies for dynamically networked organisations. In the project EEML (Extended Enterprise Modelling Language) was first constructed as a common metamodel, designed to enable syntactic and semantic interoperability".&lt;ref&gt;Håvard D. Jørgensen (2004). [http://www.idi.ntnu.no/grupper/su/publ/phd/Jorgensen-thesis.pdf ''Interactive Process Models'']. Thesis Norwegian University of Science and Technology
Trondheim, Norway. p.173-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was further developed in the EU projects Unified Enterprise Modelling Language (UEML)&lt;ref&gt;[[François Vernadat]] (2002). "UEML: towards a unified enterprise modelling language". In: ''Int. J. Production Research'', 40 (17), 4309-4321.&lt;/ref&gt; from 2002 to 2003 and the ongoing ATHENA project.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Krogstie]] and [[T.A. Halpin]], Keng Siau (2004). ''Information Modeling Methods and Methodologies''. Idea Group Inc (IGI), p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of the UEML Working group were to "define, to validate and to disseminate a set of core language constructs to support a Unified Language for Enterprise Modelling, named UEML, to serve as a basis for interoperability within a smart organisation or a network of enterprises".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ist-world.org/ProjectDetails.aspx?ProjectId=072ba8459dce4167a84182c016b32551 Unified Enterprise Modelling Language]. Accessed 29 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics==

===Modeling domains===
The EEML-language is divided into 4 sub-languages, with well-defined links across these languages:&lt;ref name="Kro06"&gt;[[John Krogstie]] (2006). [http://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/Vol-337/paper9.pdf " Using EEML for Combined Goal and Process Oriented Modeling: A Case Study"].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Process modelling]]
* [[Data modelling]]
* [[Resource modelling]]
* [[Goal modelling]]
Process modelling in EEML, according to Krogstie (2006) "supports the modeling of process logic which is mainly expressed through nested structures of tasks and decision points. The sequencing of the tasks is expressed by the flow relation between decision points. Each task has minimum an input port and an output port being decision points for modeling process logic, Resource roles are used to connect resources of various kinds (persons, organisations, information, material objects, software tools and manual tools) to the tasks. In addition, data modeling (using UML class diagrams), goal modeling and competency modeling (skill requirements and skills possessed) can be integrated with the process models".&lt;ref name="Kro06"/&gt;

===Layers===
EEML has four layers of interest:
* '''Generic Task Type''': This layer identifies the constituent tasks of generic, repetitive processes and the logical dependencies between these tasks.
* '''Specific Task Type''': At this layer, we deal with process modelling in another scale, which is more linked to the concretisation, decomposition and specialisation phases. Here process models are expanded and elaborated to facilitate business solutions. From an integration viewpoint, this layer aims at uncovering more efficiently the dependencies between the sub-activities, with regards for the resources required for actual performance.
* '''Manage Task Instances''': The purpose of this layer consists in providing constraints but also useful resources (in the form of process templates) to the planning and performance of an enterprise process. The performance of organisational, information, and tool resources in their environment are highlighted through concrete resources allocation management.
* '''Perform Task Instances''': Here is covered the actual execution of tasks with regards to issues of empowerment and decentralisation. At this layer, resources are utilised or consumed in an exclusive or shared manner.

These tasks are tied together through another layer called '''Manage Task Knowledge''' which allows to achieve a global interaction through the different layers by performing a real consistency between them. According to EEML 2005 Guide, this Manage Task Knowledge can be defined as the collection of processes necessary for innovation, dissemination, and exploitation of knowledge in a co-operating ensemble where interact knowledge seekers and knowledge sources by the means of a shared knowledge base.

===Goal modelling===
{{further|Goal modeling}}
Goal modelling is one of the four EEML modelling domains age. A goal expresses the wanted (or unwanted) state of affairs (either current or future) in a certain context. Example of the goal model is depicted below. It shows goals and relationships between them. It is possible to model advanced goal-relationships in EEML by using goal connectors. A goal connector is used when one need to link several goals.

&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;
Image:Eemlgoal.JPG|Goal modeling in EEML
File:Goal modeling Tabel.gif|Connecting relationships
Image:Goalandprocess.JPG|Goal modeling and process modeling
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In goal modelling to fulfil Goal1, one must achieve to other goals: both Goal2 and Goal3 (goal-connector with “and” as the logical relation going out). If Goal2 and Goal3 are two different ways of achieving Goal1, then it should be “xor” logical relationship. It can be an opposite situation when both Goal2 and Goal3 need to be fulfilled and to achieve them one must fulfil Goal1. In this case Goal2 and Goal3 are linked to goal connector and this goal connector has a link to Goal1 with ”and”-logical relationship.

The table indicates different types of connecting relationships in EEML goal modelling. Goal model can also be interlinked with a process model.

==Goal and process oriented modelling==
We can describe process model as models that comprise a set of activities and an activity can be decomposed into sub-activities.&lt;ref name=eeml1&gt;
Yun Lin and Arne Sølvberg Goal Annotation of Process Models for Semantic Enrichment of Process Knowledge&lt;/ref&gt; These activities have relationship amongst themselves. A goal describes the expected state of operation in a business enterprise and it can be linked to whole process model or to a process model fragment with each level activity in a process model can be considered as a goal.&lt;ref name =eeml1 /&gt;

Goals are related in a hierarchical format where you find some goals are dependent on other sub goals for them to be complete which means all the sub goals must be achieved for the main goal to be achieved. There is other goals where only one of the goals need to be fulfilled for the main goal to be achieved. In goal modelling, there is use of deontic operator which falls in between the context and achieved state.&lt;ref name=emml2&gt;J. Krogstie (2005) EEML2005: EXTENDED ENTERPRISE MODELING LANGUAGE&lt;/ref&gt; Goals apply to tasks, milestones, resource roles and resources as well and can be considered as action rule for at task. EEML rules were also possible to although the goal modelling requires much more consultation in finding the connections between rules on the different levels.&lt;ref name=eeml3&gt;John Krogstie (2008) Using EEML for Combined Goal and Process Oriented Modeling: A Case Study. IDI, NTNU,Trondheim, Norway. Proceedings of EMMSAD 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Goal-oriented analysis focuses on the description and evaluation of alternatives and their relationship to the organisational objectives.&lt;ref name=eeml4&gt;	[[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos]], Chung, and Yu (1999) : “From Object-oriented to Goal-oriented Requirements Analysis”. Communications of the ACM, January&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resource modeling==
Resources have specific roles during the execution of various processes in an organisation. The following icons represent the various resources required in modelling.

The relations of these resources can be of different types:
:a.	Is Filled By – this is the assignment relation between roles and resources. It has a cardinality of one-to-many relationship.
:b.	Is Candidate For – candidate indicates the possible filling of the role by a resource.
:c.	Has Member – this is a kind of relations between organisation and person by denoting that a certain person has membership in the organisation. Has a cardinality of many-to-many relation.
:d.	Provide Support To – support pattern between resources and roles.
:e.	Communicates With – Communication pattern between resources and roles.
:f.	Has Supervision Over – shows which role resource supervises another role or resource.
:g.	Is Rating Of – describes the relation between  skill and a person or organisation.
:h.	Is required By – this is the primary skill required for this role
:i.	Has Access to – creating of models with the access rights.

==Benefits==
From a general point of view, EEML can be used like any other modelling languages in numerous cases. However we can highlight the virtual enterprise example, which can be considered as a direct field of application for EEML with regard to Extended Enterprise planning, operation, and management.
* Knowledge sharing: Create and maintain a shared understanding of the scope and purpose of the enterprise, as well as viewpoints on how to fulfil the purpose.
* Dynamically networked organisations: Make knowledge as available as possible within the organisation.
* Heterogeneous infrastructures: Achieve a relevant knowledge sharing process through heterogeneous infrastructures.
* Process knowledge management: Integrate the different business processes levels of abstraction.
* Motivation: creates enthusiasm and commitment among members of an organisation to follow up on the various actions that are necessary to restructure the enterprise.

EEML can help organisations meet these challenges by modelling all the manufacturing and logistics processes in the extended enterprise. This model allows capturing a rich set of relationships between the organisation, people, processes and resources of the virtual enterprise.&lt;ref name=eeml5&gt;H.D. Jørgensen (2004) Interactive Process Models. Department of Computer and Information Science Faculty of Information Technology, Mathematics and Electrical Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology.  Trondheim, Norway&lt;/ref&gt; It also aims at making people understand, communicate, develop and cultivate solutions to business problems&lt;ref name=eeml6&gt;R. Matulevičius and P. Heymans (2007) Visually Effective Goal Models Using KAOS. PReCISE Research Center, Computer Science Department, University of Namur, rue Grandgagnage 21,5000 Namur, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to J. Krogstie (2008), enterprise models can be created to serve various purposes which include:

# Human sense making and communication – the main purpose of enterprise modelling is to make sense of the real world aspects of an enterprise in order to facilitate communicate with parties involved.
# Computer assisted analysis – the main purpose of enterprise modelling is to gain knowledge about the enterprise through simulation and computation of various parameters.
# Model deployment and activation – the main purpose of enterprise modelling is to integrate the model in an enterprise-wide information system and enabling on-line information retrieval and direct work process guidance.

EEML enables Extended Enterprises to build up their operation based on standard processes through allowing modelling of all actors, processes and tasks in the Extended Enterprise and thereby have clear description of the Extended Enterprise. Finally, models developed will be used to measure and evaluate the Extended Enterprise.

Endress''' (9 January 1924, in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], Germany &amp;ndash; 14 December 2008, in [[Arlesheim]], Switzerland) was a German-Swiss entrepreneur in the area of measurement and control technology, and founder of the company [[Endress+Hauser]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endress.com/de/search?filter.text=georg h. endress Georg H. Endress on The Webpage of E+H]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maschinenmarkt.vogel.de/index.cfm?pid=5112&amp;pk=160193&amp;print=true&amp;printtype=article Industry Portal: Company Founder Georg Endress dies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Georg Endress was born the son of a factory director. As a young man he moved to [[Zagreb]] with his family, where he went to school. He attended further schools in [[Basle]] (Switzerland) where he passed school-leaving exams, and then took an apprenticeship as a mechanic, after which he studied engineering in [[Zuerich]].

He worked for several Swiss companies, and one English firm, before founding a sales company for level measuring devices in [[Loerrach]] in 1953 together with  the banker Ludwig Hauser, which later became Endress+Hauser AG. The firm began producing its own instruments in 1956. After achieving success in Europe subsidiaries were opened in the USA and Japan (1970) and China (1980). In 1995 Georg Endress handed over control of the firm to his son Klaus Endress.

Georg Endress felt a particular responsibility towards the Dreiländereck (“three-country-corner”) where Germany, France and Switzerland meet, where he wanted, as he himself said, to remove psychological national barriers. He initiated Tri-Nation Apprentice and Engineering education opportunities in the upper Rhine area, promoted international courses at the [[Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University Loerrach|University Loerrach]]. The tri-nation [[BioValley (Europe)|BioValley-Organisation]] was formed on his initiative.

In addition, he was involved in Baden Trade Organisation (WVIB, Wirtschaftsverband industrieller Unternehmen Baden) and the Regional Trade Association Black Forest and Upper Rhine.  (Regio-Gesellschaft Schwarzwald-Oberrhein)

He married Alice Vogt in 1946; of their eight children five were active in Endress+Hauser AG at the end of 2008.

[[File:Girdler.svg|thumb|Girdler sulfide process]]

The '''Girdler sulfide (GS) process''', also known as the '''Geib{{ndash}}Spevack (GS) process''',&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|4620909}}, ''Method for isotope replenishment in an exchange liquid used in a laser induced isotope enrichment process''&lt;/ref&gt; is an industrial production method for filtering out of natural water the [[heavy water]] ([[deuterium]] oxide = D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) which is used in particle research, in [[Deuterium NMR]] spectroscopy, deuterated solvents for proton NMR spectroscopy, in [[heavy water reactor|heavy water nuclear reactors]] (as a [[coolant]] and [[Neutron moderator|moderator]]) and in [[deuterated drug]]s.

[[Karl-Hermann Geib]] and [[Jerome S. Spevack]] independently, and in parallel, invented the process in 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Castell |first=Lutz |date=2003 |title=Time, Quantum and Information |url=https://books.google.com/?id=X4DpCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Karl-Hermann+Geib#v=onepage&amp;q=Karl-Hermann%20Geib&amp;f=false |location=Google Books |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |page=37 |isbn=978-3-642-07892-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its name derives from the Girdler company, which built the first American plant using the process.

The method is an [[isotope|isotopic]] exchange process between [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] and [[Water (molecule)|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] ("light" water), that produces heavy water over several steps. It is a highly energy intensive process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Federation of American Scientists]], [http://www.fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/heavy.htm Heavy Water Production], accessed February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seawater]] contains 180 [[parts per million]] of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

Until its closure in 1997, the Bruce Heavy Water Plant in [[Ontario]] (located on the same site as [[Douglas Point Nuclear Generating Station|Douglas Point]] and the [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]]) was the world's largest heavy water production plant, with a peak capacity of 1600 tonnes per year (800 tonnes per year per full plant, two fully operational plants at its peak). It used the Girdler sulfide process to produce heavy water, and required {{convert|340000|t|ST|abbr=off}} of feed water to produce {{convert|1|t|ST|abbr=off}} of heavy water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/canada/01_e.pdf  | title =Bruce Heavy Water Plant Decommissioning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first such facility of India's [[Heavy Water Board]] to use the Girdler process is at Rawatbhata near Kota, Rajasthan. This was followed by a larger plant at Manuguru, Andhra Pradesh. Other plants exist in the United States and [[Romania]] for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heavywaterboard.org/htmldocs/general/HistoryBG.asp |title=Heavy Water Board – A unit under Department of Atomic Energy, Govt. of India&lt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012032227/http://heavywaterboard.org/htmldocs/general/HistoryBG.asp |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The process ==
Each of a number of steps consists of two sieve tray columns.  One column is maintained at 30{{nbsp}}°C and is called the ''cold tower'' and the other at 130{{nbsp}}°C and is called the ''hot tower''. The enrichment process is based on the difference in separation between 30{{nbsp}}°C and 130{{nbsp}}°C.

The process of interest is the equilibrium reaction,

:{| width="450"
|  style="width:50%; height:30px;"| H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + HDS {{eqm}} HDO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S
|}

At 30{{nbsp}}°C, the equilibrium constant K = 2.33, while at 130{{nbsp}}°C, K = 1.82. This difference is exploited for enriching deuterium in heavy water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1021/bk-1978-0068.ch001 | chapter-url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bk-1978-0068.ch001 | title=Separation of Hydrogen Isotopes| volume=68 | pages=1 | chapter=Selecting Heavy Water Processes | series=ACS Symposium Series | year=1978 | last1=Rae | first1=H.

[[Hydrogen sulfide]] gas is circulated in a closed loop between the ''cold tower'' and the ''hot tower'' (although these can be separate towers, they can also be separate sections of one tower, with the cold section at the top).  [[Water purification|Demineralised]] and [[Degasification|deaerated]] water is fed to the cold tower where deuterium migration preferentially takes place from the hydrogen sulfide gas to the liquid water.  Normal water is fed to the hot tower where deuterium transfer takes place from the liquid water to the hydrogen sulfide gas.  An appropriate "[[Cascade (chemical engineering)|cascade]]" setup accomplishes enrichment: "enriched" water is fed into the cold tower and is further "enriched".  

Normally in this process, water is enriched to 15{{ndash}}20% D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  Further enrichment to "reactor-grade" heavy water (&gt; 99% D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is done in another process, e.g. [[distillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Gold Coast [[central business district]] (CBD) is the planned main commercial centre of the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. The area encompasses an eastern portion of the [[Southport, Queensland|Southport]] suburb. Its north–south axis runs from [[North Street, Gold Coast|North Street]] in the north to Brighton Parade in the south. Its east–west axis runs from [[Gold Coast Broadwater|Broadwater]] in the east to the [[High Street, Gold Coast|High Street]] in the west.

==History==
{{further|History of Gold Coast, Queensland}}
Archaeological evidence suggests [[Indigenous Australians]] inhabited the area for more than ten thousand years before European settlement. The Indigenous tribe that lived in the area were known as the [[Kombumerri Clan|Kombumerri people]] and spoke the [[Yugambeh dialect|Yugambeh language]]. The Kombumerri people named the area Goo-een.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The early settlement of the Logan and Albert districts|url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/data/UQ_207601/s18378366_1935_2_5_208.pdf?Expires=1511243814&amp;Signature=g~6A2FH2gmsAaQvJEtu6DdXMmvRKZmqAziLf699dqoea5JOB48zUR-LXhLFRMDeVVCs3bsZhxiIN6klrYVRoc2Db3mNKyLEoKiIpeuyVbQVJrFQ2QUCaEH5hKoFv86SGu1~u8Z2124740~8O7dLfKd8cpk5OtPO5Nj4AbdB3AjBTHPmmLH3r8Oh7OEONQURpbrKokmGq~bbN4X0Vwv4cAYzmI8Mv0FbFnF87MhBkq-Ag5MMZXoFjuidPWRpZrBic6HIAdxopeRMlb-G7Ksrqgz-AAeDkYXsqDndgjvKLBP0knU77MHCPQFoQqWFS5KXAx0-gy1LoJxZ42r8WZinM9Q__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJKNBJ4MJBJNC6NLQ|publication-date=November 1935|author1=Hanlon, W. E|journal=Journal of the Historical Society of Queensland|volume=2|issue=5|pages=208–262|issn=1837-8366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, Richard Gardiner became the first European to settle in the area, which was known as Nerang Creek Heads at the time. Gardiner built a house and wharf on the river end of Queen Street which later led to the Loder family and several others following his lead and building in the area. The settlement was surveyed in 1874 and the area was renamed [[Town of Southport|Southport]] because it was the southernmost port of the colony of Queensland and took inspiration from the [[Southport|English seaside town]]. In 1877 [[Germans|German]] immigrant [[Johan Meyer]] acquired James Beattie's land at [[Narrow Neck, Queensland|Narrow Neck]] and started a private [[ferry]] service that transported Southport residents to the beachside area that was named [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland|Elston]] shortly after. Meyer's Ferry operated just south of Queen Street on [[Ferry Road, Gold Coast|Meyer's Ferry Road]] and would take travelers across the [[Nerang River]] to [[Cavill Avenue|Elston's Meyer's Ferry Road]]. In 1878 Richard Gardner opened the Southport Hotel, the town's first pub.

[[File:Southport Pier 1910 Photographer unknown.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The [[Southport Pier, Gold Coast|Southport Pier]] in 1910.]]

On 28 November 1883 the [[Southport Pier, Gold Coast|Southport Pier]] was opened in the sheltered [[Gold Coast Broadwater|Broadwater]]. The newly created pier allowed steamboats to unload cargo and passengers. As a result, the coastal area of Southport gained the reputation of being a fashionable seaside resort for [[Brisbane]]'s wealthy and influential but was only accessible by boat for the most part. In 1885 then [[Governor of Queensland]] [[Anthony Musgrave]] built a seaside house in Southport, further affirming the town's reputation as a destination for Queensland's wealthy and influential. A railway extension to the Southport township opened in 1889 and numerous hotels were soon established along the coastline. In 1901 the residents of Southport celebrated [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] and had grown to a permanent population of 1230. In 1922 the [[Government of Queensland|Queensland State Government]] purchased a Nerang Street site for £1737 and opened the [[Gold Coast Hospital]] shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/special-features/years-our-top-news-moments-101/story-fnpon9hl-1227543911971 130 years: Our top news moments 101]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 1925, the township of Southport had existed for 50 years. The day was declared a public holiday as the town began jubilee celebrations. The first event of the day saw the [[Governor of Queensland#List of Lieutenant-Governors of Queensland|Queensland Lieutenant-Governor]] [[William Lennon]] officially open the [[Jubilee Bridge, Southport|Jubilee Bridge]] which extended from Queen Street, Southport to Main Beach Parade, [[Main Beach, Queensland|Main Beach]].&lt;ref name=geo&gt;{{cite web|title=Jubilee Bridge (South Side)|url=http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC49R52_jubilee-bridge-south-side?guid=d42e50f7-e2ae-4e02-b23d-45a73b13cd4a|website=Geocaching|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge provided easy access to a beach for Southport residents and the connecting suburb was consequently named Main Beach.

The [[Southport Town Hall, Queensland|Southport Town Hall]] was constructed in 1935 on the corner of Davenport and Nerang Streets by the [[Town of Southport|Southport Town Council]]. On 9 December 1948, a major reorganisation of local government in [[South East Queensland]] saw the towns of Southport and [[Town of Coolangatta|Coolangatta]] amalgamate to create the [[Town of South Coast]]. Most locals felt the new name did not represent the area well and pushed for a change. The town was nicknamed ''Gold Coast'' in the 1950s and on 23 October 1958 the Town of South Coast officially changed its name to [[Town of Gold Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite QSA Agency|2476|Gold Coast Town Council|9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May 1959 it became [[City of Gold Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite QSA Agency|10379|Gold Coast Town Council|9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the city had experienced several name changes and extending of boundaries by the 1960s, Southport was still considered to be the major hub for businesses on the Gold Coast.

===CBD status recognition===
The CBD area was officially declared a priority development area on 4 October 2013 by the Queensland Minister for Economic Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2013/10/4/southport-declared-a-priority-development-area|title=Southport declared a Priority Development Area|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the announcement, many high rises began springing up inside the CBD boundaries as the revitalisation of the area began to take shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/realestate/tale-of-new-city-revival-of-gold-coasts-oldest-suburb-southport/news-story/bcc15277e52ba3417da0eee778716895|title=Tale of new city: Southport revival|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-2014, Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate claimed that Southport had always been the traditional central business district of the Gold Coast and believed more than 15% of Gold Coast residents would work inside the CBD boundaries in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/gold-coast-city-plan-provides-for-southport-cbd-20140617-zsaz6.html Gold Coast City Plan provides for Southport CBD]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revitalisation===
In July 2015, Gold Coast City Council figures showed $2.5 billion of developments had been submitted towards the revitalisation of the CBD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/new-city-council-figures-show-southport-is-at-the-centre-of-a-25-billion-development-boom/story-fnj94hf2-1227464536128|title=City’s $2.5 billion building boom|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recently completed [[Sundale Apartments|Sundale Tower]] is the tallest building in the CBD at 55-stories. A 104-storey tower known as Imperial City has been proposed inside the CBD boundaries but is yet to be approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/gold-coast/proposed-104-storey-southport-tower-poised-to-steal-q1s-crown-of-southern-hemispheres-tallest-residential-high-rise/story-fnj94idh-1226952671929|title=Is the Gold Coast ready for Q2?|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower would be the tallest residential building in the southern hemisphere should it be approved.

In August 2017, it was revealed Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate had submitted a proposal to the Queensland Government to allow a tender process to build a casino resort on a seven hectare CBD site on the corners of Queen and Scarborough Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-18/gold-coast-southport-casino-under-consideration-following-spit/8819058|title=Second casino under consideration for Gold Coast|date=18 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2017, City of Gold Coast announced a new CBD Program that aimed to revitalise the area by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cbd.wearegoldcoast.com.au/southport-projects/cbd-program-2025/|title=CBD Program 2025 - Gold Coast CBD|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The Gold Coast CBD is located in an eastern portion of the suburb of Southport. It is bordered by High Street to the west and extends as far north as North Street. To the east it is bordered by the Broadwater and extends as far south as Brighton Parade. Nerang Street is considered to be the [[Main Street]] or the primary business street of the CBD.
[[Image:Southport Town Hall, Southport, Queensland.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Town Hall on Nerang Street in 2015.]]

==Governance==
Administratively, the Gold Coast CBD falls under the authority of the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of [[City of Gold Coast]]. The [[Mayor of the Gold Coast]] is based at the [[Southport Town Hall, Queensland|Southport Town Hall]] along Nerang Street inside the CBD boundaries. The [[Government of Queensland|Queensland state government]] also has authority over some aspects of the CBD. Hinze Street is considered the legal district of the CBD as it houses the [[Southport Courthouse]], the Southport Police Station and the Southport Watch House as well as the city's official legal aid office.

==Culture==
===Broadwater Parklands===
[[Image:Southbank Broadwater Parklands, Southport, Queensland.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Broadwater Parklands in 2015.]]
In November 1928 the [[Southport Broadwater Parklands|Parklands]] along the [[Gold Coast Broadwater|Southport Broadwater]] were declared public space. The area featured public baths and a pier at the time but most aspects were eventually removed. The addition of the [[Gold Coast Aquatic Centre|Southport Pool]] in the 1960s further drew visitors to the area. The [[Queensland Government]] and [[City of Gold Coast|Gold Coast City Council]] began consultation for the redevelopment of the parklands in 2005. By late 2007 the final master plan was released and it was revealed that the stage 1 redevelopment would cost $42 million. Construction of stage 1 began in March 2008 and the finished product opened to the public on 23 August 2009.&lt;ref name="Parklands fight looms"&gt;{{cite news|last=Killoran|first=Matthew|title=Parklands fight looms|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2009/08/24/111101_gold-coast-top-story.html|accessdate=18 November 2011|newspaper=Gold Coast Bulletin|date=24 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of stage 2 began shortly after the opening of stage 1 and was completed in December 2010 at a cost of $17 million. After a few years break, construction of stage 3 began in January 2015 and will cost $10.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/gold-coast/council-begins-105-million-stage-3-of-southport-broadwater-parklands-set-to-open-in-june/story-fnj94idh-1227190005425|title=Southport’s $10.5m face lift|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third stage was opened to the public on 28 February 2016.

===Chinatown===
[[File:Confucius statue, Chinatown, Southport, Queensland.jpg|thumb|left|[[Confucius]] statue in [[Chinatown, Gold Coast|Chinatown]].]]
[[Chinatown, Gold Coast|Gold Coast's Chinatown]] is located in the CBD, focused on Davenport Street and Young Street, and includes the block boundaries of Nerang, Scarborough and Garden Streets. Gold Coast Chinatown is a unique and modern precinct that provides a place for the Gold Coast to celebrate its diversity through culture, design, people and food.  The precinct is continuously evolving with new Asian-inspired businesses, restaurants, cultural embellishments, and offers something different on the first Saturday of every month when its streets come alive with a range of exciting events such as free films, popup bars, multicultural celebrations and the much loved Chinatown Street Markets.

===Education===
[[St Hilda's School]] is the only non-tertiary educational institution located inside the CBD boundaries. St Hilda's opened in 1912 and is a p-12, independent, all girls school located on High Street. Other schools located just outside the CBD boundaries include [[The Southport School]] (TSS), Keebra Park State High School, Southport State School and [[Southport State High School]]. St Hilda's and TSS are members of the prestigious [[Great Public Schools Association of Queensland Inc.|Great Public Schools Association]] and [[Queensland Girls' Secondary Schools Sports Association]] with the top Brisbane schools.

Tertiary education inside the CBD boundaries is provided by Evocca College, [[TAFE Queensland Gold Coast|Gold Coast Institute of TAFE]] and [[Central Queensland University]].

===Religion===
There are two major religious institutions inside the CBD boundaries and both are a denomination of the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith. The Guardian Angels [[Catholicism|Catholic]] Church was established in 1882 along Scarborough Street and is the oldest church in the CBD. Shortly after St. Peter's [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] Church was built in 1887 on the corner of High Street and Nerang Street.

===Theatre===

In 1882, the Southport School of Arts was erected on the corner of Lawson and Scarborough Streets. The school included for 200 people, a stage, dressing rooms and a library. By the early 1900s, the residents of Southport had established a strong interest in the arts and cinematography. Three theatres were built inside the modern day CBD boundaries and were owned by the Thams Brothers. The Regent Theatre, located on Davenport Street, opened in 1912 and was the Gold Coast's first cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/lifestyle/cienna-development-to-be-built-on-site-of-old-regent-cinema-southport-which-opened-in-1912/story-fnsl101z-1227432636992|title=Flashback: Moving on from movies|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to demand, the theatre was expanded between 1918-1920 and increased its capacity to 1000 seats. Further demand saw the Pier Theatre open in 1926 which sat over the Broadwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2009/01/22/41655_gold-coast-news.html|title=Southport jetty to rekindle memories|author=Townsend|first=Melissa|date=22 January 2009|work=goldcoast.com.au|accessdate=31 May 2012|archive-url=http://archive.li/Rgkgw|archive-date=30 Dec 2012|dead-url=yes|publisher=News Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pier Theatre quickly became a very popular venue for pastimes in Southport. A third cinema, Savoy Theatre, was also opened shortly after on the eastern side of Nerang Street.

In December 1938, President Norman Woodroffe handed over the keys of the Southport School of Arts to the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Servicemen's League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rslclubsouthport.com.au/club-info/our-history/|title=Our History - RSL Club Southport|website=rslclubsouthport.com.au|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 the Gold Coast Little Theatre was formed and moved into their current Scarborough Street premises in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gclt.com.au/history.htm|title=--Dolphin Awards --  Gold Coast Little Theatre, Queensland, Australia|website=www.gclt.com.au|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gold Coast Little Theatre is the only remaining theatre in the CBD.

===Heritage Walk===
The Gold Coast City Council developed a Southport CBD Heritage Walk in 2008 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/thegoldcoast/gold-coast-history-heritage-71.html|title=Gold Coast history and heritage|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Gold Coast City Council]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120055939/http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/thegoldcoast/gold-coast-history-heritage-71.html|archive-date=20 November 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information was gathered by a "Call for Stories" competition with the community. The CBD loop takes 30 minutes and passes the Town Hall, the Catholic Church and the former railway station among other historical sites.

==Retail==
The Sundale Shopping Centre, which opened on 26 March 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/gold-coast/retail-mecca-take-a-look-back-at-the-gold-coasts-iconic-shopping-centres/story-fnj94idh-1226781484184|title=Our first true retail mecca|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first of its kind on the Gold Coast costing a record $7.5M but closed in 1989 after the larger Australia Fair Shopping Centre opened nearby. It was located on {{convert|12|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} of prime real estate facing the Broadwater which was previously the site of the popular Southport Hotel. As well as providing panoramic views of the [[Nerang River]] from the upper floor, it was home to Queensland's first [[Big W]] department store as well as a cinema, restaurants, 45 speciality stores and a 7,000-vehicle car park. It was proposed as a location for the building of the [[Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre|Gold Coast Convention Centre]]. Such a development would have rejuvenated the old administrative centre of the Gold Coast. However, it lost its bid to [[Broadbeach, Queensland|Broadbeach]], in part because of a lack of tourist accommodation in Southport. The site hosted weekly markets throughout the 1990s for several years after its closure, until its eventual demolition in 2003, at which time a time capsule was buried where the popular mall once stood. The area is now home to the [[Meriton]] Brighton on Broadwater development, a mix of high and low rise buildings together with trendy eateries and some retail outlets. In more recent years another a time capsule was discovered on the Sundale site which was buried when the mall was originally constructed. It was originally meant to be opened in the 2000s and was filled with notes and items which were meant to predict what the 21st century would be like. It is now located in the Gold Coast City Council Local Studies Library. In 1983 Scarborough Fair, now known as [[Australia Fair Shopping Centre|Australia Fair]], was opened on Scarborough Street.

==Sport==
Sports facilities located inside the Gold Coast CBD boundaries include the [[Gold Coast Aquatic Centre]], the Gold Coast Sport Fishing Club, James Overall Park, the [[Tennis Gold Coast|Queens Park Tennis Centre]], the Southport Bowls Club and the Southport Croquet Club. The Aquatic Centre and Fishing Club are both located inside the [[Southport Broadwater Parklands]] precinct overlooking the [[Gold Coast Broadwater|Broadwater]]. James Overall Park is located at the southern tip of the CBD boundary along Brighton Parade and houses the Eagles Rugby Union Club. The Tennis Centre and Croquet Club are located at the eastern end of Queen Street and are by far the oldest sports clubs in the CBD. The Queens Park Tennis Centre, established in 1911 as the Logan and Albert Tennis Association and based in [[Beenleigh, Queensland|Beenleigh]], moved to its current headquarters on Queen Street in 1928&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/lifestyle/gold-coast-history-queens-park-tennis-club/news-story/6c8869b0b4096b0882afef8a301c0d00|title=Flashback: Queens Park holds court|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the longest running sporting associations on the Gold Coast. Queens Park hosts the prestigious Rose Bowl Championships each year and held exhibition matches with the [[Australia Davis Cup Team|Australian Davis Cup team]] in the late 1950s. Winners of the Rose Bowl include tennis legends such as [[Rod Laver]] and [[Pat Cash]]. In recent years, the club has produced professional top 10 tennis players such as [[Samantha Stosur]] and [[Bernard Tomic]].

[[File:Southport SLSC front.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Southport Surf Lifesaving Club in 2013.]]
Sports facilities located just outside the CBD boundaries include Owen Park, the Southport Surf Life Saving Club and the Southport Yacht Club. Owen Park is located just beyond the western tip of the CBD boundary on Queen Street. In 1883, the Southport Cricket Club, then known as the Wharehouse Cricket Association, was established and set up base at Owen Park. The Southport Harness and Greyhound Racing Club later set up base at Owen Park and shared tenancy with the Cricket Club. In 1962, the [[Southport Sharks]] Australian rules football team, then known as the Southport Magpies, established itself and played out of Owen Park during the cricket off season over the winter months. In 1972, Owen Park was extended when the Southport landfill was built on by the [[Southport Tigers]] and a rugby league field was added to the park. In March 1982, the Gold Coast Australian Football League pulled off a major coup by arranging a [[Australian Football League|VFL]] exhibition match between [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]] and [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] at Owen Park. In 1987, the Sharks and Cricket Club submitted plans to relocate to west Southport and build an oval more suited to their needs. The [[Gold Coast Parklands]] racing facilities were built in 1988 and by 1989 Owen Park was left one sports tenant, the Southport Tigers. In 1999, the Gold Coast Sporting Hall of Fame opened at Owen Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Golden day for elite sports people|date=3 November 2013|url=http://www.southportstar.net/local-athletes-honoured.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224731/http://www.southportstar.net/local-athletes-honoured.html|deadurl=yes|work=Southport Star|location=Queensland|editor=Ian McDougall|accessdate=20 November 2017|archivedate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southport Surf Life Saving Club and Southport Yacht Club are located over the Broadwater in the bordering suburb of [[Main Beach, Queensland|Main Beach]]. Woodroffe Park, located in the centre of the CBD on Lawson Street, offers public basketball courts and grass areas. It is located next to the Southport Community Centre and is often presumed to be one and the same thing. The Southport Sharks, who were once based just outside the CBD boundaries at Owen Park but now reside 3 kilometres west of the Broadwater Parklands northern tip, have a long history of producing [[Australian Football League|AFL]] players, the most notable being [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] legend [[Nick Riewoldt]], the first and only Queenslander to be taken with the number 1 pick in the [[Australian Football League draft|AFL draft]].

Several schools inside and just outside the CBD boundaries run very successful sports excellence programs. The Southport School has a long history of producing [[Australian Schoolboys rugby union team|Australian rugby schoolboy representatives]] and is a strong competitor in Queensland's premier GPS rugby competition. Keebra Park State High School runs an extremely successful rugby league program and has won several [[GIO Schoolboy Cup|national schoolboy rugby league titles]] in recent years. Both schools have had many students move into the professional leagues of either respective sport following graduation.

[[File:Gold Coast Highway Bridge crossing Nerang River, Southport, Queensland in January 2017.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The [[Sundale Bridge]] connects the Gold Coast CBD to popular tourist destinations [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland|Surfers Paradise]] and [[Main Beach, Queensland|Main Beach]].]]
In 1887, German immigrant [[Johan Meyer]] provided a private ferry service, known as Meyer's Ferry, to residents that connected Southport to modern day Main Beach and Surfers Paradise. The [[South Coast railway line, Queensland|South Coast railway line]] was opened in 1889, which was a 42&amp;nbsp;km extension of the [[Beenleigh railway line]] to the township of [[Town of Southport|Southport]]. The Southport Railway Station was located on the northern end of the CBD along Scarborough Street. In 1964, the South Coast railway line was closed due to the increasing popularity of the motor car and financial losses. The last existing remnant of the site is an east–west road that was laid next to the station, known as Railway Street.
[[File:GCLR Set 1 at Southport South 2014-09-28.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The Southport South [[G:link]] station.]]
Rail transport returned to the CBD in 2014 when the first stage of the [[G:link|Gold Coast light rail]] line opened. The line included four stations inside the CBD boundaries.

Three major roads on the Gold Coast lead into the CBD which come from the south-east/north-east, south-central and the west. The [[Gold Coast Highway]] enters the CBD from Main Beach in south-east and the [[Sundale Bridge]] signifies the southern entrance into the city. The Gold Coast Highway also enters the CBD from [[Labrador, Queensland|Labrador]] in the north-east and [[Loders Creek]] Bridge signifies the northern entrance into the city. [[Ferry Road, Gold Coast|Ferry Road]] enters the CBD from the south-central and officially enters the area as the road intersects with Queen Street. The [[Smith Street Motorway, Gold Coast|Smith Street Motorway]] enters the CBD from the west and officially enters the area as the road intersects High Street and becomes North Street.

== The Hamburg Metropolitan Region as a centre of aviation ==

Companies based in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region include the aircraft manufacturer [[Airbus]] and [[Lufthansa Technik]], a market leader in the field of maintenance, repair, and overhaul of civil aircraft.&lt;ref name="rüther"&gt;Rüther, Kirstin: ''Luftfahrtstandort HAM – Tradition und Vision'' in ''Internationales Verkehrswesen'' vol. 63, March 2011, pp.2-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berichte.lufthansa.com/2008/gb/serviceseiten/downloads/files/gesamt_dlh_gb08.pdf |title=Geschäftsbericht 2008 |author=Frank Hülsmann |publisher=Deutsche Lufthansa AG |pages=94 |access-date=2013-03-04 |format=pdf; 4,0&amp;nbsp;MB |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214224451/http://berichte.lufthansa.com/2008/gb/serviceseiten/downloads/files/gesamt_dlh_gb08.pdf |archivedate=2010-02-14 |df= }}

KG |access-date=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the numerous small and medium-sized enterprises are represented by the business associations Hanse Aerospace e.V. and HECAS.
Four of Hamburg’s universities offer a course of study with significant aviation-related components: 
* the [[Hamburg University of Applied Sciences]] (HAW Hamburg)
* the [[Helmut Schmidt University]] / University of the German Federal Armed Forces Hamburg
* the [[Hamburg University of Technology]] (TUHH)
* and the [[University of Hamburg]]
Also based in Hamburg are the [[German Aerospace Center]]’s Institute of Aerospace Medicine and Institute of Air Transportation Systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dlr.de/dlr/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10257/311_read-222/ |title=Der Standort Hamburg des DLR |publisher=Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.

=== The focus on cabins: Crystal Cabin Award and Aircraft Interiors Expo {{anchor|Aircraft Interiors Expo}}===

A particular focus for many aviation companies in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region is the interior fittings of aircraft along with the design of aircraft cabins. Airbus develops and builds the cabins for the A380 at [[Finkenwerder Airport]], and Lufthansa Technik AG designs [[in-flight entertainment]] systems along with luxury VIP fittings for private aircraft.&lt;ref name="gallagherAII" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/crystal-cabin-award.html |title=Wo die inneren Werte zählen – Hamburgs Kabinenkompetenz |publisher=Luftfahrtcluster Metropolregion Hamburg e.V. |access-date=2013-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319210813/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/crystal-cabin-award.html |archivedate=2013-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also numerous small and medium-sized enterprises specialised in cabin design, cabin fittings, cabin technology and In-Flight Entertainment and Communications (IFE&amp;amp;C).
The aviation region’s focus on this field is clearly seen in the Aircraft Interiors Expo, an annual specialist trade fair held in Hamburg since 2002. Launched in 2007, the [[Crystal Cabin Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crystal-cabin-award.com/index.php?id=160 |title=General Information |publisher=Crystal Cabin Award Association |access-date=2013-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106210825/http://www.crystal-cabin-award.com/index.php?id=160 |archivedate=2014-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for outstanding product innovations in the field of aircraft interior fittings is presented as part of this trade fair.&lt;ref&gt;Munke, Hans-Jörg: Weltweit führende Fachmesse, Artikel in: Hamburger Abendblatt, 21. März 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is funded by the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg.

== The aerospace cluster: Hamburg Aviation ==

In the field of [[economics]], an accumulation of companies spread throughout the value creation chain, interwoven with research and training facilities, such as exists in the aviation industry in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region, is termed a [[Business cluster]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Michael E.: Clusters and the New Economics of Competition; Harvard Business Review: 1998&lt;/ref&gt; A cluster is defined by a triple helix structure: the interplay between commerce, research and education, and the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;Etzkowitz, Henry: The Triple Helix. University-Industry-Government Innovation in Action, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2001, companies, universities and government bodies joined forces to establish the “Hamburg Aviation Initiative” in order to promote the development of the aviation industry cluster in Hamburg. This developed into the “Luftfahrtcluster Metropolregion Hamburg e.V.” association, with 15 founding members, formally established in 2011. Hamburg Aviation is the brand name of this association. Its goal is the joint coordination of initiatives to support the aviation industry in the region.&lt;ref name="hamburg-aviation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/ueber-uns/spitzencluster.html |title=Hamburg Aviation: Strategie und Erfolge des Spitzenclusters |publisher=Hamburg-aviation.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620134414/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/ueber-uns/spitzencluster.html |archivedate=2013-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of its work include the initiation of cooperative research projects and the management of EU research projects along with regular industry gatherings such as the Hamburg Aviation Forum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/hamburg-aviation-forum.html |title=Hamburg Aviation: Das Hamburg Aviation Forum |publisher=Hamburg-aviation.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802042757/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/hamburg-aviation-forum.html |archivedate=2013-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the organisation of events designed to secure the next generation of aviation specialists.

=== Winning the Leading-Edge Cluster competition ===

In 2008, the then Hamburg Aviation Initiative was recognised as a Leading-Edge Cluster in the first Leading-Edge Cluster Competition organised by the German [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] (BMBF).&lt;ref&gt;Geisler, Bob: [http://www.abendblatt.de/wirtschaft/article559622/Bund-staerkt-Hamburger-Luftfahrtbranche.html ''Bund stärkt Hamburger Luftfahrtbranche''] Article in Hamburger Abendblatt, 3 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a total of 40 million euros of public funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bild.de/regional/hamburg/forschung/euro-fuer-hamburgs-luftfahrt-forschung-5684244.bild.html ''Hamburg Luftfahrt-Forschung: Bund gibt 40 Millionen Euro'']. Article in Bild, 3 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This partial funding, combined with the support of companies in the cluster, financed numerous research and development projects.&lt;ref name="hamburg-aviation" /&gt; The total investment in research and development as a result of winning the competition was over 80 million euros.&lt;ref name="rüther" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aerobrief"&gt;''Luftfahrtcluster Metropolregion Hamburg e. V. mit neuem Vorstand zu neuen Horizonten'' in ''Aerobrief 25/2011'' 30 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Network projects: ZAL and HCAT ===

In 2009, as a network project of the universities, aviation enterprises, industry associations, research institutions and the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, the Center of Applied Aeronautical Research (Zentrum für Angewandte Luftfahrtforschung, or ZAL) was established – an initiative of Hamburg Aviation.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Brendan: ''Hamburg hothouse for cabin technology to open in 2013'' in ''APEXnews'' 15 March 2011, Airline Passenger Experience Association, London, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The cooperative campus of the Hamburg Centre of Aviation Training (HCAT), is one project focussed on the training of qualified specialist personnel, securing the next generation of aviation specialists.&lt;ref name="gallagherAII"&gt;Gallagher, Brendan: ''hamburg hothouse'' in ''Aircraft Interiors International'' June 2011, pp.66-72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schütte, Gisela: [https://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/hamburg/article13877009/Ein-Flugzeug-als-schwieriges-Puzzlespiel.html ''Ein Flugzeug als schwieriges Puzzlespiel. Studenten lernen im HCAT, wie Kabinen und Cockpits optimal gestaltet werden''].Online at: Die Welt, 20 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hamburg Aviation: the next generation ===

Securing the next generation of qualified personnel is a significant focus of the work of Hamburg Aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/nachwuchsfoerderung.html |title=Hamburg Aviation: Nachwuchsförderung und Qualifizierung |publisher=Hamburg-aviation.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723190931/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/nachwuchsfoerderung.html |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous projects, jointly supported by the industry, the city and the universities, serve this purpose. Examples include the Faszination Technik Klub,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faszination-fuer-technik.de/startseite.html |title=Faszination Technik Klub für Kinder &amp; Jugendliche in Hamburg |publisher=Faszination-fuer-technik.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; organising lectures and events related to aviation for children and teenagers, and the [[DLR School Lab]] at the Hamburg University of Technology, where school pupils can carry out technical and scientific experiments.

=== International cooperative programs ===

Another area in which the association is active is the promotion of international cooperation between aviation locations. In May 2009, Hamburg Aviation launched the [[European Aerospace Cluster Partnership]] (EACP).&lt;ref name="rüther" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/ueber-uns/partnerschaft-kooperationen.html |title=Hamburg Aviation: Weltweite Kooperationen |publisher=Hamburg-aviation.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723194553/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/ueber-uns/partnerschaft-kooperationen.html |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the organisation is to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and to initiate cooperative projects across national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eacp-aero.eu |title=EACP: European Aerospace Cluster Partnership |language=de |publisher=Eacp-aero.eu |date=2013-06-23 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such project is CARE: Clean Aerospace Regions, funded by the European Commission. The project provides a framework for 10 partners, 8 of them EACP members, to collaborate in promoting research into ecologically efficient technologies and processes for the air transportation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://care-aero.eu |title=CARE Aero: CARE Aero |publisher=Care-aero.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829020312/http://care-aero.eu/ |archivedate=2013-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health marketing''' is a new, customer-centered, approach to [[public health]] promotion that applies traditional marketing principles and theories alongside science-based strategies to protect and promote the health of diverse populations.It involves creating, communicating, and delivering messages for the public on [[Preventive medicine|prevention]], [[health promotion]] and health protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/whatishm.html|title=What is Health Marketing? {{!}} Gateway to Health Communication {{!}} CDC|date=2017-02-23|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health marketing is one of the ways advancements in medicine and in health-protecting services, such as insurance, are made widely known.
A good example is the current drive in [[Kenya]] to promote circumcision among communities that do not customarily circumcise. [[Medical research]]ers have recently documented that circumcision is 65% effective in preventing [[HIV]] infection among men.

The marketing strategy would follow the traditional 4 "P's" of marketing namely:

*The "product" in question in this case the surgical procedure.
*The "place" which refers to the access to this procedure.
*"Promotion" refers to creating awareness and hence demand.
*"Price" refers to the cost of the procedure e.g. money, time, reputation etc.

"Health marketing" is a term rarely used in public health and related disciplines.  "Social marketing" or "integrated marketing communication" are more commonly used in public health and other disciplines to refer to marketing-based planning frameworks for public health communication.

&lt;br /&gt;

== Medical marketing in the private sector ==
'''Health marketing''' or '''Medical Marketing''' is a specialized branch of [[marketing]]. Medical marketing was born from the necessity for private health professionals to attract new patients, the characteristics of the health market makes it a unique kind of marketing. Medical marketing is usually a [[business to consumer]] (B2C) service. Doctors using this type of marketing usually offer beauty related services, such as [[aesthetic medicine]], [[plastic surgery]], [[dental surgery]] or [[dermatology]].  

=== Regulations. ===
In many countries it is forbidden to pay for advertising of medical procedures, specially in aesthetics and [[plastic surgery]]. Showing “before and after” pictures or making references to someone’s body type can be seen as harmful for society.

The solution for a health care professional or a [https://www.medicalmarketingagency.net medical marketing agency] is [[Instagram marketing]] since nowadays it remains unregulated, being the fastest growing social media in the planet gives doctors an opportunity to acquire new patients through Instagram Marketing.

'''''Hispanic Enterprise Magazine''''', formerly '''''Hispanic Trends Magazine''''', was a joint project of Editorial Televisa&lt;ref name=bwir&gt;{{cite news|title=PODER Magazine Launches Miami Edition|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20071001005465/en/PODER-Magazine-Launches-Miami-Edition|accessdate=18 November 2015|work=BusinessWire|date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.  Its headquarters was in Miami, Florida.&lt;ref name=bwir/&gt; The publication is a source of news, features and information for every Hispanic entrepreneur and anyone affiliated with the Hispanic marketplace. In 2006, ''Hispanic Enterprise'' successfully launched its digital version.

Published in English, ''Hispanic Enterprise'' aimed at the business community of Hispanic entrepreneurs. It was primarily distributed to members of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, which at last count in 2005, numbered approximately 2 million in the United States, generating almost $300 billion in annual gross receipt.

In July 2008, the magazine was combined with ''[[PODER Magazine]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketingymedios.com/marketingymedios/noticias/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003830382 Televisa Combines 'Poder' and 'Hispanic Enterprise']&lt;/ref&gt; and started circulating under the name ''PODER Enterprise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Newly Titled Poder Enterprise Grows Its Circulation|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&amp;tkr=CHILES:CI&amp;sid=a0tuDmhrAf7U|accessdate=18 November 2015|work=Bloomberg|date=31 July 2008|location=Miami, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14742">In [[economics]], '''hot money''' is the flow of funds (or capital) from one country to another in order to earn a short-term profit on [[interest rate]] differences and/or anticipated [[exchange rate]] shifts. These speculative [[capital (economics)|capital flows]] are called 'hot money' because they can move very quickly in and out of markets, potentially leading to market instability.&lt;ref name = "CRS"&gt;CRS Report for Congress, July 21, 2008: China’s “Hot Money” Problems, by Micheal F. Martin and Wayne M. Morrison&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustration of hot money flows==
The following simple example illustrates the phenomenon of hot money: In the beginning of 2011, the national average rate of one year [[certificate of deposit]] in the United States is 0.95%. In contrast, China's benchmark one year deposit rate is 3%. The [[Chinese currency]] (renminbi) is seriously undervalued against the world's major trading currencies and therefore is likely to appreciate against the US dollar in the coming years. Given this situation, if an investor in the US deposits his or her money in a Chinese bank, the investor would get a higher return than that in the situation in which he or she deposits money in a US bank. This makes China a prime target for hot money inflows. This is just an example for illustration. In reality, hot money takes many different forms of investment.
 
The following description may help further illustrate this phenomenon: "one country or sector in the world economy experiences a [[financial crisis]]; capital flows out in a panic; investors seek a more attractive destination for their money. In the next destination, capital inflows create a boom that is accompanied by rising indebtedness, rising asset prices and booming consumption - for a time. But all too often, these capital inflows are followed by another crisis. Some commentators describe these patterns of capital flow as “hot money” that flows from one sector or country to the next and leaves behind a trail of destruction."&lt;ref&gt;Hot Money and Serial Financial Crises, Anton Korinek, IMF Economic Review (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of hot money==
As mentioned above, capital in the following form could be considered hot money:
* Short-term foreign [[portfolio investment]]s, including investments in [[Equity (finance)|equities]], [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and [[Derivative (finance)|financial derivatives]]
* Short-term foreign bank loans
* Foreign bank loans with short term investment horizon
 
The types of [[Financial capital|capital]] in the above categories share common characteristics: the investment horizon is short, and they can come in quickly and leave quickly.

== Estimates of total value ==
There is no well-defined method for estimating the amount of “hot money” flowing into a country during a period of time, because “hot money” flows quickly and is poorly monitored. In addition, once an estimate is made, the amount of “hot money” may suddenly rise or fall, depending on the economic conditions driving the flow of funds. One common way of approximating the flow of “hot money” is to subtract a nation’s [[Balance of trade|trade surplus]] (or deficit) and its net flow of [[Foreign direct investment|foreign direct investment (FDI)]] from the change in the nation’s [[Foreign exchange reserves|foreign reserves]].&lt;ref name = "CRS"/&gt;

Hot Money (approx) = Change in foreign exchange reserves - Net exports - Net foreign direct investment

== Sources and causes ==

Hot money is usually originated from the capital rich, developed countries that have lower GDP growth rate and lower interest rates compared to the GDP growth rate and interest rate of [[Emerging markets|emerging market]] economies such as India, Brazil, China, Turkey, Malaysia etc. Although the specific causes of hot money flow are somewhat different from period to period, generally, the following could be considered as the causes of hot money flow:&lt;ref name="calvoetal"&gt;Inflows of Capital to Developing Countries in the 1990s, by Calvo, Leiderman, Reinhart, Journal of Economic Perspective 1996&lt;/ref&gt; 
* a sustained decline of interest rates in the highly industrialized, developed countries. The lower interest rates in the developed nations attract investors to the high investment yields and improving economic prospects in Asia and Latin America.
* a general trend towards international diversification of investments in major financial centers and towards growing integration of world [[capital market]]s.
* [[emerging markets|Emerging market]] countries began to adopt sound monetary and fiscal policies as well as market-oriented reforms including trade and capital market liberalization. Such policy reforms, among others, have resulted in a credible increase in the rate of return on investments.

As described above, hot money can be in different forms. [[Hedge fund]]s, other portfolio investment funds and international borrowing of domestic financial institutions are generally considered as the vehicles of hot money. In the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|1997 East Asian Financial Crisis]] and in the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|1998 Russian Financial Crises]], the “hot money” chiefly came from banks, not portfolio investors.&lt;ref&gt;Hot Money, by Martin N.Baily, Diana Farrell, and Susan Lund, May 2000, McKinsey Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact==

Capital flows can increase welfare by enabling households to smooth out their consumption over time and achieve a higher level of consumption. Capital flows can help developed countries achieve a better international diversification of their portfolios.&lt;ref name="calvoetal"/&gt;

However, large and sudden inflows of capital with a short term investment horizon have negative  macroeconomic effects, including rapid monetary expansion, inflationary pressures, real exchange rate appreciation and widening [[current account]] deficits. Especially, when capital flows in volume into small and shallow local [[financial market]]s, the exchange rate tends to appreciate, asset prices rally and local commodity prices boom. These favorable asset price movements improve national fiscal indicators and encourage domestic credit expansion. These, in turn, exacerbate structural weakness in the domestic bank sector. When global investors' sentiment on emerging markets shift, the flows reverse and asset prices give back their gains, often forcing a painful adjustment on the economy.&lt;ref name=bonanzas&gt;Capital Flow Bonanzas: An Encompassing View of the Past and Present, by Carmen M. Reinhart and Vincent R. Reinhart, NBER Working Paper No. 14321, September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are the details of the dangers that hot money presents to the receiving country's economy:

* '''Inflow of massive capital with short investment horizon (hot money)''' could cause asset prices to rally&lt;ref name=bonanzas/&gt; and [[inflation]] to rise. The sudden inflow of large amounts of foreign money would increase the monetary base of the receiving country (if the central bank is pegging the currency), which would help create a credit boom. This, in turn, would result in such a situation in which "too much money chases too few goods". The consequences of this would be inflation.

Furthermore, hot money could lead to exchange rate appreciation or even cause exchange rate overshooting. And if this exchange rate appreciation persists, it would hurt the competitiveness of the respective country's export sector by making the country's exports more expensive compared to similar foreign goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo J. Caballero, Guido Lorenzoni, 2007. Persistent Appreciation and Overshooting: A Normative Analysis. (MIT and NBER)&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Sudden outflow of hot money''', which would always certainly happen, would deflate asset prices and could cause the collapse value of the currency of respective country. This is especially so in countries with relatively scarce internationally liquid assets. There is growing agreement that this was the case in the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|1997 East Asian Financial Crisis]]. In the run-up to the crises, firms and private firms in South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia accumulated large amounts of short-term foreign debt (a type of hot money). The three countries shared a common characteristic of having large ratio of short term foreign debt to international reserves. When the capital started to flow out, it caused a collapse in asset prices and exchange rates. The financial panic fed on itself, causing foreign creditors to call in loans and depositors to withdraw funds from banks. All of these magnified the illiquidity of the domestic financial system and forced yet another round of costly asset liquidations and price deflation. In all of the three countries, the domestic financial institutions came to the brink of default on their external short term obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Short Term Capital Flows, by Dani Rodrik, Andres Velasco, 1999 NBER&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some economists and financial experts argue that hot money could also play positive role in countries that have relatively low level of foreign exchange reserves, because the capital inflow may present a useful opportunity for those countries to augment their central banks' reserve holdings.&lt;ref name=imf2010&gt;Capital Inflows: The Role of Controls, IMF Staff Position Note, February 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Control ==
Generally speaking, given their relatively high interest rates compared with that of the developed market economies, [[emerging market]] economies are the destination of hot money. Although the emerging market countries welcome capital inflows such as [[foreign direct investment]], because of hot money's negative effects on the economy, they are instituting policies to stop "hot money" from coming into their country in order to eliminate the negative consequences.

Different countries are using different methods to prevent massive influx of hot money. The following are the main methods of dealing with hot money.&lt;ref name=imf2010/&gt;

* '''Exchange rate appreciation''': the exchange rate can be used as a tool to control the inflow of hot money. If the currency is believed to be undervalued, that would be a cause of hot money inflow. In such circumstance, economists usually suggest a significant one-off appreciation rather than a gradual move in the [[exchange rate]], as a gradual appreciation of the exchange rate would attract even more hot money into the country. One downside of this approach is that exchange rate appreciation would reduce the competitiveness of the [[export]] sector.
* '''Interest rate reduction''': countries that adopt this policy would lower their central bank's benchmark interest rates to reduce the incentive for inflow. For example, on December 16, 2010, the [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey|Turkish Central Bank]] surprised markets by cutting interest rates at a time of rising inflation and relatively high [[economic growth]]. Erdem Basci, deputy bank governor of Turkish Central Bank argued that gradual rate cuts were the best way to prevent excessive capital inflows fuelling asset bubbles and currency appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Turkey surprises with interest rate cut, by Delphine Strauss, Financial Times, December 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On February 14, 2011, Mehmet Simsek, the Turkish Finance Minister said: “more than $8 billion in short-term investment had exited the country after the central bank cut rates and took steps to slow credit growth. The markets have got the message that Turkey does not want hot money inflows”&lt;ref&gt;Simsek Says $8 Billion ‘Hot Money’ Left Turkey, by Steve Bryant, Bloomberg News, Feb 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Capital controls]]''': some capital control policies adopted by China belong to this category. For example, in China, the government does not allow foreign funds to invest directly in its [[capital market]]. Also, the [[People's Bank of China|central bank of China]] sets quotas for its domestic [[financial institution]]s for the use of short-term foreign debt and prevent banks from overusing their quotas.&lt;ref&gt;China enhances efforts to curb hot money inflow, China Daily, November 09, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1991, the Chilean government instituted a non-remunerated (non-paid) 20 percent reserve requirement to be deposited at the Central Bank for a period of one year for liabilities in foreign currency, for firms which are borrowing directly in foreign currency.&lt;ref&gt;Controls on Short-Term Capital Inflows - The Latin American Experience and Lessons For DMCs, by Pradumna B. Rana. Asian Development Bank, Economics and Development Resource Center Briefing Notes, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Increasing bank reserve requirements and sterilization''': some countries pursue a [[fixed exchange rate]] policy. In the face of large net capital inflow, those countries would [[currency intervention|intervene in the foreign exchange market]] to prevent exchange rate appreciation. Then sterilize the monetary impact of intervention through [[open market operations]] and through increasing [[bank reserve]]s requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Capital Inflows: Macroeconomic Implications and Policy Responses, by Roberto Cardarelli, Selim Elekdag, M. Ayhan Kose, IMF Working Paper, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when hot money originated from the U.S. enters China, investors would sell [[United States dollar|US dollars]] and buy [[Chinese yuan]] in the [[foreign exchange market]]. This would put upward pressure on the value of the yuan. In order to prevent the appreciation of the Chinese currency, the central bank of China print yuan to buy US dollars. This would increase money supply in China, which would in turn cause inflation. Then, the central bank of China has to increase [[bank reserve]] requirements or issue Chinese government bonds to bring back the money that it has previously released into the market in the [[exchange rate]] intervention operation. However, like other approaches, this approach has limitations. The first, the [[central bank]] can't keep increasing [[bank reserves]], because doing so would negatively affect bank's profitability. The second, in the [[emerging market]] economies, the domestic [[financial market]] is not deep enough for [[open market operations]] to be effective.
* '''[[Fiscal policy|Fiscal]] tightening''': the idea is to use fiscal restraint, especially in the form of spending cuts on nontradables, so as to lower aggregate demand and curb the inflationary impact of capital inflow.&lt;ref&gt;Capital Flows in the APEC Region (book), edited by Mohsin S. Khan, Carmen M. Reinhart. International Monetary Fund, March 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17287">{{Intellectual property}}
An '''industrial design right''' is an [[intellectual property]] right that protects the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian.  An [[industrial design]] consists of the creation of a shape, configuration or composition of pattern or color, or combination of pattern and color in thre-dimensional form containing aesthetic value.  An industrial design can be a two- or three-dimensional pattern used to produce a product, industrial commodity or handicraft.

Under the [[Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs]], a [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]]-administered treaty, a procedure for an international registration exists. To qualify for registration, the national laws of most member states of WIPO require the design to be novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Making Design Registration Cheaper and Easier |url=http://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/briefs/sct.html |publisher =WIPO |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An applicant can file for a single international deposit with WIPO or with the national office in a country party to the treaty. The design will then be protected in as many member countries of the treaty as desired.  Design rights started in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1787 with the Designing and Printing of Linen Act and have expanded from there.

Registering for an industrial design right is related to granting a [[patent]].&lt;ref name="Trinder1992"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Trinder |first=Barrie |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Industrial Archaeology |title=design registration |year=1992 |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |isbn=0631142169 |pages=207–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==

=== Kenya ===
According to industrial property Act 2001, an industrial design is defined as "any composition of lines or colours or any three-dimensional form whether or not associated with lines or colours, provided that such composition or form gives a special appearance to a product of industry or handicraft and can serve as pattern for a product of industry or handicraft" .

An industrial design is registrable if it is new. An industrial design is deemed to be new if it has not been disclosed to the public, anywhere in the world, by publication in tangible form or, in Kenya by use or in any other way, prior to the filing date or, where applicable, the priority date of the application for registration. However a disclosure of the industrial design is not taken into consideration if it occurred not earlier than twelve months before the filing date or, where applicable, the priority date of the application and if it was by reason or in consequence of acts committed by the applicant or his predecessor in title; or an evident abuse committed by a third party in relation to the applicant or his predecessor in title.

=== India ===
India's Design Act, 2000 was enacted to consolidate and amend the [[law]] relating to protection of design and to comply with the articles 25 and 26 of [[TRIPS]] agreement. The new act, (earlier Patent and Design Act, 1911 was [[repealed]] by this act) now defines "design" to mean only the features of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament, or composition of lines or colours applied to any article, whether in two- or three-dimensional, or in both forms, by any industrial process or means, whether manual or mechanical or chemical, separate or combined, which in the finished article appeal to and are judged solely by the eye; but does not include any mode or principle of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Design Act, 2000 (16 of 2000) |url=http://www.patentoffice.nic.in |publisher=patentoficce.nic.in |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522044754/http://patentoffice.nic.in/ |archivedate=2010-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indonesia ===
In Indonesia the protection of the Right to Industrial Design shall be granted for 10 (ten) years commencing from the filing date and there is not any renewal or annuity after the given period.

* Industrial Designs that are Granted Protection
1. The Right to Industrial Design shall be granted for an Industrial Design that is novel/new&lt;br&gt;
2. An Industrial Design shall be deemed new if on the filing date, such Industrial Design is not the same as any previous disclosure.&lt;br&gt;
3. The previous disclosure as referred to in point 2 shall be one which before :&lt;br&gt;
a. The filing date or &lt;br&gt;
b. The Priority Date, if the applicant is filed with priority right.&lt;br&gt;
c. Has been announced or used in Indonesia or outside Indonesia.&lt;br&gt;
 
An industrial design shall not be deemed to have been announced if within the period of 6 (six) months at the latest before the filing date, such industrial design &lt;br&gt;
a. Has been displayed in a national or international exhibition in Indonesia or overseas that is official or deemed to be official; or,&lt;br&gt;
b. Has been used in Indonesia by the designer in an experiment for the purposes of education, research or development. &lt;br&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Design Act of Indonesia, 2000 (31 of 2000) [http://www.ambadar.com Industrial Design Attorney in Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Canadian law affords ten years of protection to industrial designs that are registered; there is no protection for unregistered designs.  The ''Industrial Design Act''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Industrial Design Act'' (R.S.C., 1985, c. I-9)|url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-9/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines "design" or "industrial design" to mean "features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament and any combination of those features that, in a finished article, appeal to and are judged solely by the eye."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Industrial Design Act'', s. 2|url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-9/section-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design must also be original: in 2012, the Patent Appeal Board rejected a design for a [[trash can]], and gave guidance as to what the Act requires:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Alain Provost|year= 2012|title= Recent Guidance on the Criteria for Originality in Canadian Industrial Designs|url= http://newsletter.robic.ca/nouvelle.aspx?lg=EN&amp;id=225|journal= Robic Newsletter|publisher= ROBIC LLP|volume= 16|issue= 2|pages= |doi= |pmc= |pmid= }}, discussing ''Re Victor Stanley Inc.'', 2012 CarswellNat 885&lt;/ref&gt;

:* The degree of originality required to register an original design is greater than that laid down by Canadian copyright legislation, but less than that required to register a patent.
:* The articles being compared should not be examined side by side, but separate so that imperfect recollection comes into play.
:* One is to look at the design as a whole.
:* Any change must be substantial. It must not be trivial or infinitesimal.

During the existence of an exclusive right, no person can "make, import for the purpose of trade or business, or sell, rent, or offer or expose for sale or rent, any article in respect of which the design is registered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Industrial Design Act'', s. 11|url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-9/section-11.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule also applies to kits and substantial differences are in reference to previously published designs.

Registering an industrial design in Canada may be appropriate for a variety of articles such as consumer products, vehicles, sports equipment, packaging, etc., having an original aesthetic appearance, and may even be used to protect new technologies such as electronic icons. Industrial designs can also serve to complement other forms of intellectual property rights such as patents and trade-marks.&lt;ref name="NRF2012"&gt;{{cite web|author1 = André Thériault|author2 = Christopher N. Hunter|title = Hen’s tooth found: Federal Court decides industrial design infringement case|url = http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/knowledge/publications/72637/hens-tooth-found-federal-court-decides-industrial-design-infringement-case|publisher = [[Norton Rose Fulbright]]|date = November 2012|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140116092918/http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/knowledge/publications/72637/hens-tooth-found-federal-court-decides-industrial-design-infringement-case|archivedate = 2014-01-16|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian courts see infrequent litigation concerning industrial designs {{emdash}} the first case in almost two decades took place in 2012 between [[Bodum]] and [[Trudeau Corporation]] concerning visual features of double wall drinking glasses.&lt;ref name = "NRF2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Bodum USA, Inc. v.

It is possible for a registered design to also receive protection under Canadian copyright or trademark law:

:* a "useful article" (ie, one with a utilitarian function) will receive copyright protection where it is reproduced in a quantity of fifty or less, but that limitation does not apply with respect to:
:** a graphic or photographic representation that is applied to the face of an article
:** a trade-mark or a representation thereof or a label
:** material that has a woven or knitted pattern or that is suitable for piece goods or surface coverings or for making wearing apparel
:** a representation of a real or fictitious being, event or place that is applied to an article as a feature of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Copyright Act'' (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42), s. 64 |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/section-64.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* where a registered design has become publicly identifiable with the product, it may be eligible for registration as a "distinguishing guise" under trademark law, but such registration cannot be used to limit the development of any art or industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Trade-marks Act'' (R.S.C., 1985, c. T-13), s. 13 |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/T-13/section-13.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
{{Main|Industrial design rights in the European Union}}
Registered and unregistered [[community design]]s are available which provide a unitary right covering the [[European Community]]. Protection for a registered community design is for up to 25 years, subject to the payment of renewal fees every five years. The unregistered community design lasts for three years after a design is made available to the public and infringement only occurs if the protected design has been copied.

====United Kingdom====
{{main|Design right (United Kingdom)}}
Legislation given in Britain during the years 1787 to 1839 protected designs for textiles. The Copyright of Design Act passed in 1842 allowed other material designs, such as those for metal and earthenware objects, to be registered with a diamond mark to indicate the date of registration.&lt;ref name="Trinder1992"/&gt;

In addition to the design protection available under community designs, UK law provides its own national registered [[design right]] ([[Registered Designs Act 1949]], later amended by [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]) and an unregistered design right. The unregistered right, which exists automatically if the requirements are met, can last for up to 15 years. The registered design right can last up to 25 years subject to the payment of maintenance fees. The topography of semi-conductor circuits are also covered by [[integrated circuit layout design protection]], a form of protection which lasts 10 years.

===Japan===
{{main|Japanese design law}}
Article 1 of the Japanese Design Law states: "This law was designed to protect and utilize designs and to encourage creation of designs in order to contribute to industrial development".  The protection period in Japan is 20 years from the day of registration.

===United States===
U.S. [[design patent]]s last fifteen years from the date of grant if filed on or after May 13, 2015 (fourteen years if filed before May 13, 2015) and cover the ornamental aspects of utilitarian objects. Objects that lack a use beyond that conferred by their appearance or the information they convey, may be covered by copyright—a form of [[intellectual property]] of much longer duration that exists as soon as a qualifying work is created. In some circumstances, rights may also be acquired in trade dress, but trade dress protection is akin to trademark rights and requires that the design have source significance or "secondary meaning." It is useful only to prevent source misrepresentations; trade dress protection.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, design patent registration lasts for 5 years, with an option to be extended once for an additional 5 years. For the patent to be granted, a formalities exam is needed. If infringement action is to be taken, the design needs to become certified which involves a substantive examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baxterip.com.au/patent-design-australia |title=How to Patent Designs |publisher=Baxterip.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910032046/http://www.baxterip.com.au/patent-design-australia |archivedate=2011-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duration of design rights==
Depending on the jurisdiction registered design rights have a duration between 15 to 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;This is the range of contracting parties of the [http://www.wipo.int/hague/en/ WIPO Hague system]&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the WIPO Hague system have to publish their maximum term of protection for design rights. These terms are presented in the table below. Some of the jurisdiction below are unions or collaborative office for design registration like the [[African Intellectual Property Organization]], the [[European Union]] and the [[Benelux]].

{{Sociology}}
'''Industrial sociology''', until recently a crucial research area within the field of '''sociology of work''', examines
{{quote|the direction and implications of trends in [[technological]] change, [[globalization]], labour markets, work organization, [[managerial]] practices and [[division of labour|employment relations]] to the extent to which these trends are intimately related to changing patterns of inequality in modern societies and to the changing experiences of individuals and families the ways in which workers challenge, resist and make their own contributions to the patterning of work and shaping of work institutions.{{sfn|Watson|2008|p=392}}}}

== Labour process theory ==
One branch of industrial sociology is [[labour process theory]] (LPT). In 1974, [[Harry Braverman]] wrote ''[[Labor and Monopoly Capital]]'', which provided a critical analysis of scientific management. This book analysed [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[economic production|productive]] relations from a [[Marxist]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Meiksins |first=Peter |year=1994 |title='Labor and Monopoly Capital' for the 1990s: A Review and Critique of the Labor Process Debate |magazine=Monthly Review |volume=46 |issue=6 |location=New York |issn=0027-0520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Marx, Braverman argued that work within capitalist organizations was exploitative and alienating, and therefore workers had to be coerced into servitude. For Braverman the pursuit of capitalist interests over time ultimately leads to deskilling and routinization of the worker. The [[Taylorism|Taylorist]] work design is the ultimate embodiment of this tendency.

Braverman demonstrated several mechanisms of control in both the factory [[blue-collar]] and clerical [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] labour force.
His key contribution is his "[[deskilling]]" thesis.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}  Braverman argued that capitalist owners and managers were incessantly driven to deskill the labour force to lower production costs{{sfn|Attewell|1987|pp=324–325}} and ensure higher productivity.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Deskilled labour is cheap and above all easy to control due to the workers' lack of direct engagement in the production process.{{sfn|Attewell|1987|pp=324–325}} In turn work becomes intellectually or emotionally unfulfilling; the lack of capitalist reliance on human skill reduces the need of employers to reward workers in anything but a minimal economic way.

Braverman's contribution to the sociology of work and industry (i.e., industrial sociology) has been important and his theories of the labour process continue to inform teaching and research.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Braverman's thesis has, however, been contested, {{citation needed span |date=July 2018 |text=notably}} by Andrew Freidman in his work ''Industry and Labour'' (1977).{{sfn|Friedman|1977|pp=80–82}}{{verification needed|date=July 2018}} In it, Freidman suggests that whilst the direct control of labour is beneficial for the capitalist under certain circumstances, a degree of "responsible autonomy" can be granted to unionized or "core" workers, in order to harness their skill under controlled conditions. Also, Richard Edwards showed in 1979 that although hierarchy in organizations has remained constant, additional forms of control (such as technical control via email monitoring, call monitoring; bureaucratic control via procedures for leave, sickness etc.) has been added to gain the interests of the capitalist class versus the workers. Duncan Gallie{{sfn|Gallie|1991}} has shown how important it is to approach the question of skill from a social class perspective. In his study, the majority of non-manual, intermediate and skilled manual workers believed that their work had come to demand a higher level of skill, but the majority of manual worker felt that the responsibility and skill needed in their work had either remained constant or declined. This means that Braverman's claims can't be applied to all social classes.

The notion the particular type of technology workers were exposed to shapes their experience was most forcefully argued in a classic study by [[Robert Blauner]].{{sfn|Blauner|1964}} He argued that some work is alienating more than other types because of the different technologies workers use.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Alienation, to Blauner, has four dimensions: powerlessness, meaninglessness, isolation, and self-estrangement.{{sfn|Blauner|1964|pp=15–16}} Individuals are powerless when they can't control their own actions or conditions of work; work is meaningless when it gives employees little or no sense of value, interest or worth; work is isolating when workers cannot identify with their workplace; and work is self-estranging when, at the subjective level, the worker has no sense of involvement in the job.

Blauner's claims however fail to recognize that the same technology can be experienced in a variety of ways. Studies have shown that cultural differences with regard to management–union relations, levels of hierarchical control, and reward and [[performance appraisal]] policies mean that the experience of the same kind of work can vary considerably between countries and firms.{{sfn|Jenkins|1994}} The individualization of work and the need for workers to have more flexible skills in order to respond to technological changes means that Blauner's characterization of work experience is no longer valid. Additionally, workers today may work in teams to alleviate workers' sense of alienation, since they are involved in the entire process, rather than just a small part of it. In conclusion, automative technologies and computerized work systems have typically enhanced workers' job satisfaction and skill deployment in the better-paid, secure public and private sector jobs. But, in more non-skilled manual work, they have just perpetuated job dissatisfaction, especially for the many women involved in this type of work.

'''Jeux du Commerce West''', '''JDC West Business Competition''' or informally, '''JDC West''' is an annual business competition featuring top business schools and students from across [[Western Canada]], as well as the largest undergraduate business competition in Western Canada.  The first competition, hosted by UBC, occurred January 20-23, 2006, and attracted over 400 students. JDC West was modeled after [[:fr:Jeux du Commerce|Jeux du Commerce]] and allows the competition to move from host university/city to host university/city each given year.  

==Structure==

Each university sends one team of 50+ representative students to participate respectively in one of 10 Academic Competitions, 1 Parliamentary Debate, 1 Athletic Competition or 1 Social Competition.  Points are awarded and accumulated towards a team being declared "School of the Year".

===Academics===

There are 10 core Academic Competitions. That being said, an organizing committee may add any number of additional academic cases, providing that the core academic cases (listed below) are included.  Each competition has 3 students from each team participate. In each case competition participants have a fixed amount of time to review the facts and prepare before presenting to the industry judges and experts. 

Current academic events for JDC West are:
* [[Accounting]]
* [[Business Strategy]]
* [[Entrepreneurship]] 
* [[Finance]] 
* [[Human Resource Management]] 
* [[International Business]]
* [[Business Technology Management]] 
* [[Marketing]]
* [[Not-for-profit Business Strategy]] (added in 2009)
* [[Taxation]] (removed for 2019)
* Operations Management (added for 2019)

===Debate===

Each debate team has 4 students.  They have 30 minutes to review the proposal before presenting.  As it is in [[Parliamentary Debate|parliamentary style]], one team is designated ''Team Government'' and the other ''Team Opposition''.

===Athletics===

The hosting school chooses the sport each year. The teams include both male and female competitors. 

*2006: Indoor Soccer (Futsol)
*2007: Handball
*2008: Dodgeball
*2009: Volleyball, Westcoast Kickball, Inner-tube Water Polo, Relay (6 X 200)
*2010: Indoor Soccer played on two 190 x 90’ fields on FIFA sanctioned Polytan artificial turf.
*2011: Inner-Tube Water Basketball &amp; Ultimate Frisbee
*2012: Flag Football &amp; [[Yukigassen]]
*2013: Doctor Dodgeball &amp; Netball
*2014: Floor Hockey &amp; [[Tchoukball]]
*2015: European Handball &amp; [[Schtick (disc game)|Schtick Disc]]
*2016: Dodgeball &amp; Floor Ringette
*2017: Korfball &amp; DBL Ball
*2018: [[Quidditch]] &amp; [[Tchoukball]]
*2019: Tsegball &amp; D-Hoops

===Social===

Each social team has 4 students - two males and two females. The social portion of the JDC West competition is arguably the most arduous on its competitors who are on-call for ten social challenges to be completed in less than 48 hours at any time of day or night. These entertaining challenges are known to include spirit, mental and physical challenges that bring the 4 students together in a way no team sport could. These challenges test students adaptability, enthusiasm and team work to the extreme.

===Additional awards===

Participation - Focuses on the spirit of each school during the competition weekend. The team that cheers the hardest, shows up for the most events, and is the life of the party takes the prize.

Charity - Has two awards. One for the number of hours that school commits to their charities of choice and the second for the amount of dollars raised for their charity of choice.

==History of the Games==
===History of JDC and JDC West===   
The original '''[[:fr:Jeux du Commerce|Jeux du Commerce]]''', French for "Commerce Games" started as a Business Student Competition in 1989 in [[Eastern Canada]]. They were created in 1988 thanks to the initiative of some students of HEC MONTREAL who wanted to strengthen the links between the students of business administration through the province of Quebec. Mister Patrice Bourbonnais was the student heading a team of co-founders, including Patrick Bérard and Benoît Lessard, as well as others students. The School of Hautes Etudes Commerciales (French business school) of Montreal was the first institution host of the Games (Sets) of the Business in January, 1989.  [[:fr:Jeux du Commerce|Jeux du Commerce]] grew throughout the years and became one of the largest events hosted by [[:fr:regroupement étudiant des facultés d'administration de l'Est du Canada (RÉFAEC)|REFAEC]].  In 2003, Yannick Denis-Trudel, the president of [[:fr:regroupement étudiant des facultés d'administration de l'Est du Canada (RÉFAEC)|REFAEC]] at the time had a vision to expand "the games" to the rest of Canada.  In an attempt to unify the country under the [[:fr:Jeux du Commerce|Jeux du Commerce]] banner, he took on the task of inviting a group of delegates from across Canada to visit the games and see what they were all about.  Students returned to their schools excited, but lacked a bit of direction in terms of establishing the games in their own regions.  The year after, Yannick made another attempt to get the rest of Canada excited about the games and created a competing team called "Team Rest of Canada" or "Team ROC".  The intention was to allow those visiting the games to actively take part in the games, rather than just watch from the sidelines.  Student's went back to their respective schools with an excitement to bring [[:fr:Jeux du Commerce|Jeux du Commerce]] to their respective regions.  At Roundtable 2005, one bid to host the event in the Western Region by students from the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia, Co-Led by Jeff Potter and Nik Laufer-Edel.  Another bid was put forth for the Ontario region by Guelph Humber.  The Western bid was approved by the presidents of the western business schools of the Canadian Business School Council and allowed JDC West to take its first steps to be actualized.

In 2006, over 1,200 business students from 13 Eastern universities in Canada chose to compete. Since its inauguration, the JDC has become a prestigious annual event noted for its academic excellence and superior teamwork development.  Like JDC West, JDC consists of Athletic, Social, Debate and community involvement components. 

The JDC legacy expanded to Ontario schools in 2009, in a competition branded as JDC Central.
    
Following the success of '[[:fr:Jeux du Commerce|Jeux du Commerce]]' a desire was expressed to create similar games in Western Canada, ultimately leading to a Commerce Competition on a national scale.  The Western Games were dubbed ''JDC West''. JDC West has exemplified professionalism and excellence, while focusing on the unique challenges facing a Western Canadian business student.  The academic structure of the competition is maintained, encouraging students to strive for excellence and professionalism, while continuing the goodwill and good sportsmanship that JDC has been known for.

The JDC West Business Competition was incorporated as a not-for-profit in 2010 prior to JDC West 2011. In 2011, a volunteer Board of Directors was voted in by the Presidents of the participating business schools' students societies in collaboration with their JDC West Team Captains. This board is composed of active JDC West alumni and the current Organizing Committee's External Co-Chair. The board's main roles are to oversee the long-term strategy, risk mitigation, relationship management and high level financial health of the competition to ensure its long-term sustainability.

Piasecka Johnson "often physically and emotionally abused her husband", trial adversaries said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20093724,00.html Kristin McMurran, "The Band-Aid Heir Left All He Owned to His Widow, but His Children Claim It Was Just Seward's Folly",] ''People'', May 26, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&amp;dat=19860228&amp;id=dPMPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yYwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5649,10288166 "Jury gets two views of widow",] ''Boca Raton News'', February 28, 1986, p. 2A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19860228&amp;id=qp0rAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KPwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4094,6151187 Samuel Maull, "Lawyers' speeches portray Johnson widow as shrew",] ''The Telegraph'' February 28, 1986, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; He signed his final will on April 14, 1983, leaving the bulk of his fortune to her.

The exclusion of the rest of his family from the will led to at least three highly publicized legal battles: One in which his six children from his first two marriages sued on grounds that he wasn't mentally competent at the time he signed the will.

Today, the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution is the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, a research institute within Florida Atlantic University. The governing board of the former Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution then became the governing board of the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Foundation which retained other parcels of land and an endowment funded by the J.

The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Foundation exists today with a mission to support Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute.

He founded ''Xian Janssen Pharmaceutical'', the Sino-Belgian joint venture of [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]], a Flemish pharmaceutical company in Belgium.

==Career==
For almost 25 years, he was responsible for chemical manufacturing and international production at [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]], and together with Chinese partners, he established Xian Janssen Pharmaceutical. After the opening of China in 1978, their first factory was set up by Joos Horsten in [[Hanzhong]], after which a second and larger factory followed in [[Xi'an]].

From 1992 to 1997, he continued his career at [[Solvay (company)|Solvay Pharmaceuticals]], a Belgian chemical and pharmaceutical multinational, as Vice-President Technical Affairs, and in 1997 established his own company, as a consultant to Chinese pharmaceutical companies. His contacts led to other companies doing business in China: Xian Thiebaut Pharmaceutical Packaging Co, and Xian Flanders Innovation Services (XFIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trends.be%2Fnl%2Farchief%2F2004%2F18%2520November%25202004%2FVerover%2BChina%2Bvia%2BXian-6484-223009.html&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;history_state0=| title=FLEMISH SMEs pave the way | author=Erik Bruyland | work=Trends Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13389">'''Kenneth D. Mackenzie''' (born 1937) is an American organizational theorist, former Professor at the [[University of Kansas]] and  management consultant. He is known for his early work on the "Theory of Group Structures"&lt;ref&gt;Wilke, Henk AM, and Roel W. Meertens. "Group performance." (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; and his later work on [[organizational design]]&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Thomas W.

Management science 33.10 (1987): 1317-1332.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Mackenzie received his BA in Mathematics with a minor in Physics in 1960 from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where in 1964 he also obtained his Ph.D. in Business Administration.&lt;ref name="IWKM"&gt;[http://www.kuonlinedirectory.org/endacott/data/OralHistoryTranscripts/KENNETH%20MACKENZIE.pdf AN INTERVIEW WITH KENNETH MACKENZIE Interviewer: Jewell Willhite]. at kuonlinedirectory.org. Accessed 04.02.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his graduation Mackenzie started his academic career in 1964 at the Carnegie-Mellon University as Assistant Professor of Economics. In 1967 he moved to the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="IWKM"/&gt; In 1972 he moved to the  [[University of Kansas]], where he was appointed Edmund P. Learned Distinguished Professor from January 1972 to January 2006. He further taught at U.C. Berkeley, [[University of Waterloo]], and KU. In 2000 Mackenzie founded the consultancy firm EMAC Assessments, LLC.

Mackenzie has served on numerous editorial boards including ''[[Management Science]],'' ''[[Organizational studies]],'' ''International Journal of Organizational Analysis,'' ''[[Journal of Management Inquiry]],'' Human Systems Management,'' and ''Engineering Management Research.''

He has published 19 books and over 100 articles.

== Work ==
Mackenzie research interests have been in the fields of [[organization theories]], [[organization design]] processual models, [[organizational leadership]], multi-level research and the discoverer of the [[organizational hologram]].

=== Approach to Research ===
Mackenzie’s research is based on his bed rock belief that there are only three fates of any theory:  to be (a) ignored, (b) rejected, and (c) revised.  Consequently, it is self-evident and unreasonable for him to expect any of his theories to escape these fates.  Therefore, he is not interested in "proving" or justifying them.  He knows that they somehow must be wrong.  What he chooses to publish is his current best effort but only after finally failing to find grievous fault.  The goal is to improve theories rather than to defend them.  The best way to do this is to actively search for and highlight hidden flaws and inconsistencies.  Finding these flaws provides vital clues for making improvements in the theory.  Fixing them paves the path to improvements.

To this end, Mackenzie never begins any research project if he already has a clear understanding of how to solve it.  What would be the point?  In fact he only works on projects for which he does not know the results.  This way he is frequently surprised and grateful to witness new wonders.  Surprises refocus thinking and provide information about how one of his theories is wrong.  Surprise stimulates the necessity for more improvements.  The constant goal is seeking disconfirmations.  The motto is "Always Failing Forward!"  Obtaining a confirmation adds no new information, does nothing to improve a theory, and uses up scarce resources.  Confirming what is already known is thus viewed as an ineffective strategy for theory improvement.  But a disconfirmation is a stimulus, a call to action which impels one to stumble forward in order to seek improvements.  One succeeds by failing.

Mackenzie is keenly interested in discovering and enhancing explanations of patterned behavior.  Thus, he values theory.  He is especially interested in the patterns of behavior within groups and organizations.

His approach to research is both deliberate and naïve.  There are steps he follows in performing an empirical or conceptual study.  However, he tries to ignore any latent preconceived specific theory or a fixed toolkit of methods.  To him the phenomena is paramount and not the literature.  He always wants a fresh, independent look at a problem whenever possible.  The first step is to "wallow" in the phenomena until reaching an intuitive feel for them.  (Please note:  to wallow in the phenomena is not the same thing as wallowing in the literature about the phenomena).  Next is the effort to formulate the research questions, taking care to always to be "anchored" in the phenomena.  This formulation provides a narrative and means to begin the development of some explanation for the phenomena.  Once an explanation is developed, the question becomes:  how can this be refuted?  The next step is to refute it.  This is the easiest step!  This basic research process iterates until one runs out of new ideas for refuting the explanation.  Stopping to write up results is the next step.  These developments are merged into a wider stream of his past research work and where feasible, the relevant literatures.  Because of the importance he places on counterexamples, he eschews the use of mathematical statistics in favor of strong inference.  His purpose is to use each research adventure to help erect a less ramshackle theoretical edifice for the group and organizational sciences.

He usually works on many questions simultaneously and moves quickly to reject unpromising avenues of research.  He strives to avoid the Type III error of working on the wrong problem.  Ideas pop up all over and the trick to give each a chance and then discard the bad ones.  In the pungent language of hunters, "do not feed the dog that won’t hunt."

Mackenzie sometimes works as a management consultant in order to hear of new problems and thus new questions and to fund his research.  However, he never accepts a consulting project if he thinks that he already knows the answer.  He does not offer recommendations for organizational changes unless the client agrees he knows enough to run the organization.  He is always an advocate for the well-being of the organization itself.

=== Representing Group and Organizational Structures and Processes ===
As a researcher, a teacher, an author, and an editor, he frequently encounters the difficulty of how to represent fundamental concepts such as leadership, structure, and process.  In particular, the representations of structure and group and organizational processes are especially interesting and important because they cut across the group and organizational sciences.

In this regard, he has learned two things worth mentioning produced over a course of many years of research into organizational phenomena:  the representation of group and organizational (a) structures and (b) processes.  Both concepts are central to discussions of group and organizational processes (GOPs).  And neither is represented consistently among scholars and practitioners.  The result is confusion and barriers to cumulation.  For how can one build on another’s results when the other’s methods and concepts are inconsistent with one’s own?

=== Representing Group and Organizational Structures ===
A structure, S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, of a group or organization of n agents, '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, …, x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) can be represented by this equation:

::'''S'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = ('''X'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;; '''R''') 					                                              (Equation 1)

where the matrix '''R''' has n rows and n columns and entries r&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; where row i corresponds to the "sender," x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; , the column j corresponds to the "receiver," x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; , and the value of an entry r&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; is a measure of an interaction from x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.  The value of r&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; can range from a binary relation such as a boss-subordinate to how many thousands of board feet of douglas fir, 4-side finished, eight foot 2 x 4’s were sold by wholesaler i to retailer j during a specified time period.

The x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ϵ '''X''' are engaged Processual Agents such as individuals, groups (e.g. committees, task forces, virtual teams, etc.), and even organizations.  The dimension and measures for the entries, r&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; , are chosen for the purposes of an analysis.  It is important to realize that in this representation of group and organizational structures, the entries r&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; reflect the '''actual''' relationship between its members relevant to the purposes of the study.  Please note the asymmetry:  r&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; rarely equals r&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt; .  Also, in some applications, not all of the Processual Agents x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ϵ '''X''' are, in fact, human.

Given this representation of group and organizational structures, the following conclusions have strong empirical support:
#Structures are more accurately viewed as effects rather than causes of behavior.
#Different tasks may have different structures.
#Groups and organizations have multiple structures.
#These structures are interdependent.
#Structures can and do change.
#A structure represents a need satisfying interaction pattern.  As needs change, so will the structures to satisfy them as long as there is net benefit for the change.
#These structural change processes can be modeled and explained.
#Most group and organizational behavior takes place "outside" of the formal lines of authority.  Departures from the organizational chart are normal.
#Processes and their structures are independent.

=== Representing Group and Organizational Processes ===
Any group and organizational process (GOP) can be represented as:

::'''Y''' = '''F'''('''C''') 							                                                (Equation 2)

where '''C''' is a vector of considerations or steps in a GOP, '''F''' is a network illustrating the linkages between each of the considerations or steps, and '''Y''' is the set of outcomes of the GOP.

Intuitively, a GOP is a time dependent sequence of behaviors governed by a process framework given by equation (2).  The GOP representation of equation (2) is derived from these six ontological axioms:

#A GOP involves one or more processual agents.
#A GOP involves two or more linked process elements.
#A GOP is not random.
#A GOP is linked to at least one other GOP.
#A GOP representation requires process resources and involves their characteristics-in-use.
#A GOP has more than one level.

{{confuse|Michel Estevan}}

'''Michel Antoine Gaston Esteban''' (born 7 May 1951) is a French [[record producer]], [[record label|record company executive]], [[cultural center]] director and former [[magazine editor]], who founded the Paris shop Harry Cover in 1973, was influential in the early development of [[punk rock]], and, together with [[Michael Zilkha]], established the [[New York City|New York]]-based [[record label]] [[ZE Records]] in 1978.

== Life and career==
Esteban was born in Paris. From 1968, he studied [[graphic arts]] at L'École d'Arts Graphiques in the city, and in 1973 founded a shop in the [[Les Halles|Rue des Halles]], Harry Cover, which specialised in [[rock music|rock]] merchandise, magazines and books as well as imported records from the US and UK.  The basement was used as a rehearsal space by bands, particularly as the [[punk rock]] scene developed in the mid 1970s.  In 1974 Esteban travelled around the US, returning to New York where he studied under [[Milton Glaser]] at the [[School of Visual Arts]].  He became a friend of [[Patti Smith]], [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[Richard Hell]] and [[Tom Verlaine]] of [[Television (band)|Television]], and [[John Cale]], and was a regular visitor to the [[CBGB]] music club.&lt;ref name=ink&gt;[http://www.zerecords.com/2010/about_interview_3.php INK 19: Interview with Michel Esteban, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916210724/http://www.zerecords.com/2010/about_interview_3.php |date=2010-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=strangedays&gt;[http://www.zerecords.com/2010/about_interview_1.php ''Strange Days'' magazine: interview with Michel Esteban, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916210655/http://www.zerecords.com/2010/about_interview_1.php |date=2010-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Returning to Paris in 1975, he founded the magazine ''Rock News'', which began chronicling the emergence of the punk music scene in the US, UK and France, coming into contact with [[Lester Bangs]], Richard and Lisa Robinson, and [[Danny Fields]] in the US, and [[Malcolm McLaren]] and [[Vivienne Westwood]] in England.&lt;ref name=ink/&gt;  Together with then-girlfriend [[Lizzy Mercier Descloux]],&lt;ref name=strangedays/&gt; he attended many of the early punk performances in [[England]], and published Mercier Descloux's first book of poems, ''Desiderata'', as well as Patti Smith's ''[[Witt (book)|Witt]]'' and ''The Night''.  He helped promote the first punk rock concerts in France, with the [[Sex Pistols]] in September 1976, and promoted the French band [[Stinky Toys]] in England.

In 1977, Esteban shared his time between Paris and New York, forming Rebel Records and recording French band [[Marie &amp; les Garçons]].  In New York, he worked with John Cale, who introduced him to British-born entrepreneur and writer [[Michael Zilkha]].  They set up Cale's record label, SPY, before Esteban and Zilkha left to set up another label, [[ZE Records]].&lt;ref name=vman&gt;[http://www.zerecords.com/2010/about_interview_2.php VMAN magazine: John Norris: interview with Michel Esteban, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916210703/http://www.zerecords.com/2010/about_interview_2.php |date=2010-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, Esteban was in a relationship with fashion editor [[Anna Wintour]].&lt;ref name=strangedays/&gt; Over the next four years, ZE became one of the most influential and fashionable record labels in the world, recording such artists as [[Kid Creole &amp; the Coconuts]], [[Was (Not Was)]], [[Bill Laswell]], [[Lydia Lunch]], and [[Suicide]], and bringing together aspects of punk rock, the art of the [[Lower East Side]] such as [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] and [[Keith Haring]], and the disco scene.&lt;ref name=vman/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/5978110/Mutant-disco-from-planet-ZE.html  Thomas H Green, "Mutant disco from planet ZE", ''Daily Telegraph'', 13 August 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Esteban left New York after differences with Zilkha in 1982.&lt;ref name=ink/&gt;   In 1983 he produced the album ''Paolino Parc'' by French [[New wave music|new wave]] band Octobre.  He also continued to work closely with Lizzy Mercier Descloux, visiting, recording and undertaking promotional work in Asia, Africa, and South America.  He produced her successful single "Mais où sont passées les gazelles?", and the albums ''Lizzy Mercier Descloux'' (1984) and ''One For The Soul'' (1986). In 1986, he began working with the Portuguese-born Belgian singer [[Lio]], producing her albums ''Pop Model'' (1986) and ''Cancan'' (1988); their daughter was born in 1987 but they separated in 1989.&lt;ref name=strangedays/&gt;

During the 1990s, Esteban retreated from the music business and studied esoteric disciplines including [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Sufism]].  Later in the decade he recorded musicians in [[Cuba]].  In 2003 he re-established ZE Records, based in Paris, which has reissued many of the label's original recordings as well as new material, including [[Glasgow]] band Michael Dracula.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;  He now lives in [[Salvador da Bahia]], Brazil, where he has a cultural arts center project including galleries and recording studios.&lt;ref&gt;http://en-afabrica.tumblr.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Baccaglini''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[United States|America]]n [[entrepreneur]], [[investor]], and former chairman of [[U.S. Città di Palermo]], football (soccer) club based in [[Palermo]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="ywf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Baccaglini reveals Palermo owners|url=http://www.football-italia.net/101326/baccaglini-reveals-palermo-owners|publisher=Football Italia|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baccaglini is an eccentric personality, known for his career in television.&lt;ref name="lemons"&gt;{{cite web|title=Said &amp; Done: ‘He will be a serious president. I leave Palermo in safe hands’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/12/said-and-done-football-diary-carlo-tavecchio-fifa-palermo|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, he made news by attempting to acquire the Palermo soccer club from former owner [[Maurizio Zamparini]]; the takeover, originally agreed in March 2017, was called off by June of the same year before being finalized.

== Biography ==
Raised in the [[United States]] with an [[United States|American]] father and [[Italy|Italian]] mother, Baccaglini was born in [[Chicago]] but spent most of his youth in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Baccaglini's mother came to the [[United States]] to study [[Neuroscience|Neurobiology]] at [[Harvard University]], while his father is from Washington. His parents separated when he was 15 years old.&lt;ref name="biog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Il Palermo? Come una bella donna da conquistare|url=https://www.vanityfair.it/news/sport/17/03/22/paul-baccaglini-chi-presidente-palermo-iene-pif-intervista|language=it|publisher=Vanity Fair Italia|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from high school, Baccaglini later moved to his mother's native Italy to pursue a career in [[Basketball]]. Baccaglini played two years with the Serie C Gold Unione Basket Padova basketball club from 2002 to 2003,&lt;ref name="basketball"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Baccaglini Player Profile|url=http://basketball.eurobasket.com/player/Paul-Baccaglini/Italy/Unione-Basket-Padova/50810|publisher=Euro Basket|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluding his brief career with the Solesino basketball club.

=== Television Personality ===
Leaving behind his sporting career, Baccaglini transitioned into work in radio, working for [[Radio Padova]] as host of the program "The Groove" for three years on RTL 102.5. Following his success in radio, Baccaglini began work for [[MTV]] and [[Italia 1]], appearing regularly on the program Le Iene, on which he interviewed numerous personalities in politics. Baccaglini was known for his use of sarcasm and irony, and the program was well-known for deploying its hosts to dupe public figures for comic effect.&lt;ref name="leIene"&gt;{{cite web|title=Palermo chaos continues despite Zamparini supposedly stepping back|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/20/palermo-maurizio-zamparini-chaos-serie-a|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baccaglini claimed in an interview with ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' that he has more than 60 tattoos.&lt;ref name="negoc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Baccaglini: 'Palermo collaboration'|url=http://www.football-italia.net/99841/baccaglini-palermo-collaboration|publisher=Football Italia|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Città di Palermo===

Baccaglini negotiated the purchase of [[U.S. Città di Palermo]] in secret for more than one year before finally coming to terms with former owner [[Maurizio Zamparini]] in March 2017.&lt;ref name="negoc" /&gt; As part of the agreement, he was named as club chairman until the takeover was not finalized. In his initial press conference, he declared that his goal was to bring Palermo to be one of the best teams in [[Serie A]], and to compete in the [[UEFA Champions League]].

Baccaglini claims that an investment in the club is better than investing in [[Chelsea F.C.]] due to the potential higher return on investment.&lt;ref name="chelsea"&gt;{{cite web|title=Palermo are a better investment than Premier League leaders Chelsea, says new club president Paul Baccaglini|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4309904/Better-invest-Palermo-Chelsea-says-Baccaglini.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his initial enthusiasm for the potential takeover, Palermo's win-loss record did not improve enough to prevent the club from relegating to [[Serie B]] for the 2017-18 season.

On 4 July 2017, Baccaglini resigned as Palermo chairman, falling back into the hands of Zamparini, after the necessary funds were not in place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.football-italia.net/105234/baccaglini-resigns-palermo-president&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peopleware''' is a term used to refer to one of the three core aspects of computer technology, the other two being [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]]. Peopleware can refer to anything that has to do with the role of people in the development or use of computer software and hardware systems, including such issues as developer productivity, teamwork, group dynamics, the psychology of programming, project management, organizational factors, human interface design, and human-machine-interaction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Larry Constantine]] ''Constantine on Peopleware'' Prentice Hall, 1995, p. xxi. ({{ISBN|0-13-331976-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The concept of peopleware in the software community covers a variety of aspects:&lt;ref&gt;Silvia T. Acuna (2005). ''A Software Process Model Handbook for Incorporating People's Capabilities''. pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Development of productive persons
* Organizational culture
* Organizational learning
* Development of productive teams, and	
* Modeling of human competencies.

== History ==
The neologism, first used by [[Peter G. Neumann]] in 1977&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter G. Neumann]] "Peopleware in Systems." in ''Peopleware in Systems.'' Cleveland, OH: Assoc. for Systems management, 1977, pp 15–18. ({{ISBN|0-934356-13-0}})&lt;/ref&gt; and independently coined by Meilir Page-Jones in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;Page-Jones, M. ''Practical Guide to Structured Systems Design.'' New York: Yourdon Press. ({{ISBN|0-13-690769-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; was popularized in the 1987 book ''[[Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams]]'' by [[Tom DeMarco]] and Timothy Lister.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom DeMarco]] and Timothy Lister. ''[[Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams]].'' New York: Dorset House, 1987. ({{ISBN|0-932633-43-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Peopleware" also became the title and subject matter of a long-running series of columns by [[Larry Constantine]] in Software Development magazine, later compiled in book form.&lt;ref&gt;[[Larry Constantine]] ''The Peopleware Papers'' Prentice Hall, 2001. ({{ISBN|0-13-060123-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personal selling''' occurs when a sales representative meets with a potential client for the purpose of transacting a [[Sales|sale]]. Many sales representatives rely on a sequential sales process that typically includes nine steps. Some sales representatives develop scripts for all or part of the sales process. The sales process can be used in face-to-face encounters and in [[telemarketing]].

==Definition==

Personal selling can be defined as "the process of person-to-person communication between a salesperson and a prospective customer, in which the former learns about the customer's needs and seeks to satisfy those needs by offering the customer the opportunity to buy something of value, such as a good or service."&lt;ref&gt;Cant, M.C. and van Heerde, C.V., ''Personal Selling,'' Juta, 2004, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The term may also be used to describe a situation where a company uses a sales force as one of the main ways it communicates with customers.

==Brief history==

The earliest forms of exchange involved bartering systems. However, the advent of coinage enabled exchange to occur more efficiently and over much larger distances. The earliest references to selling, involving coin-based exchange, comes from [[Herodotus]] who noted that "The [[Lydians]] were the first people we know of to use a gold and silver coinage and to introduce the retail trade."  &lt;ref&gt;Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, "A History of Marketing Thought,"  in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Barton A Weitz and Robin Wensley (eds), Sage, 2003, p. 41, Online: https://www.researchgate.netpublication235362475_A_History_of_Marketing_Thought&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that selling and buying, originated in the 7th century BCE, in the area now known as Turkey. From there, selling spread along Mediterranean, and then diffused throughout the civilized world.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, "A History of Marketing Thought,"  in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Barton A Weitz and Robin Wensley (eds), Sage, 2003, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The Socratic philosophers expressed some concerns about the new type of selling in around the 4th century BCE. Their commentary was primarily concerned with potential disruption of the more social aspects of selling. Traditional forms of exchange encouraged a social perspective - emphasising the social bonds that united members of a society. For example, during periods of drought or famine, individuals shared in the plight of their neighbours. However, the advent of this new form of selling encouraged a focus on the individual such that in times of scarcity, sellers raised their prices.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, E.H. and Jones, D.G.B, "A History of Marketing Thought,"  in ''Handbook of Marketing,'' Barton A Weitz and Robin Wensley (eds), Sage, 2003, pp 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Medieval period, trade underwent further changes. Localised trading based on transactional exchange and bartering systems was slowly transformed as transportation improved and new geographic markets were opened.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., ''The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century,'' Berkely, CA, University of California Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; From the 11th century, the [[Crusades]] helped to open up new trade routes in the Near East, while the adventurer and merchant, [[Marco Polo]] stimulated interest in the far East in the 12th and 13th centuries. Medieval merchants began to trade in exotic goods imported from distant shores including spices, wine, food, furs, fine cloth, notably silk, glass, jewellery and many other luxury goods. As trade between countries or regions grew, trade networks became more complex and different types of sellers filled in the spaces within the network. During the thirteenth century, European businesses became more permanent and were able to maintain sedentary merchants in a home office and a system of agents who operated in different geographic markets.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, M. and Lee, J., "The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective," ''Business History Review,'' Vol 85, Spring, 2011, doi:10.1017/S0007680511000018, pp 22–26&lt;/ref&gt; Exchange was often conducted at arm's length, rather than face-to-face.

Local market traders and itinerant peddlers continued to supply basic necessities, but permanent retail shops gradually emerged from the 13th century, especially in the more populous cities.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, N. and Hubbard, E., ''The Buildings of England: Cheshire'' Penguin, 1978, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; By the 17th century, permanent shops with more regular trading hours were beginning to supplant markets and fairs as the main retail outlet. Provincial shopkeepers were active in almost every English market town. These shopkeepers sold a very broad range of general merchandise, much like a contemporary general store.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England,'' Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p,. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Large business houses involved in import and export often offered additional services including finance, bulk-breaking, sorting and risk-taking. In the 17th century, the public began to make mental distinctions between two types of trader; local traders (Dutch: ''meerseniers'') which referred to local merchants including bakers, grocers, sellers of dairy products and stall-holders, and the merchants (Dutch: ''koopman''), which described a new, emergent class of trader who dealt in goods or credit on a large scale. With the rise of a European merchant class, this distinction was necessary to separate the daily trade that the general population understood from the rising ranks of merchants who operated on a world stage and were seen as quite distant from everyday experience.&lt;ref&gt;Honig, E.A., ''Painting &amp; the Market in Early Modern Antwerp,'' Yale University Press, 1998, pp 6-10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 18th century England, large industrial houses, such as [[Wedgewood]], began mass-producing certain goods such as pottery and ceramics and needed a form of mass distribution for their products. Some [[peddler]]s were employed by these industrial producers to act as a type of travelling sales representative, calling on retail and wholesale outlets in order to make a sale.&lt;ref&gt;Tadajewski, M. and Jones, D.G.B., "Historical research in marketing theory and practice: a review essay," ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vol. 30, No. 11-12, 2014 [Special Issue: Pushing the Boundaries, Sketching the Future], pp 1239-1291&lt;/ref&gt; In England, these peddlers were known as ''Manchester men'' because of the prevalence of the practice in the sale of cotton cloth manufactured in [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;Silver, A.W., ''Manchester Men and Indian Cotton, 1847-1872,'' pp 54-58 and p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Employed by a factory or entrepreneur, they sold goods from shop to shop rather than door to door and were thus operating as a type of wholesaler or distribution intermediary.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, M. and Lee, J., "The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective," ''Business History Review,'' Vol 85, Spring, 2011, doi:10.1017/S0007680511000018, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  They were the precursors to the field sales representative.

==Selling roles and situations==

Sales activity can occur in many types of situations. Field representatives call on clients, who are typically business clients; door-to-door sales teams call on householders, sales staff may work in a [[retail]] or [[Wholesaling|wholesale]] environment where sales personnel attend to customers by processing orders or sales may occur in a telemarketing environment where the sales person makes telephone calls to prospects. In terms of number of transactions, most selling occurs at the retail level; but in terms of value, most selling occurs at the high-end business-to-business level.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, P.E., "George E Brenkert- Marketing Ethics," [Book Review], ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews,'' 24 May 2009 &lt;Online:http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/marketing-ethics/&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of sales roles can be identified:
* ''Order takers'' refers to selling that occurs primarily at the wholesale or retail levels. Order processing involves determining the customer needs, pointing to inventory that meets the customer needs and completing the order.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, L.E. and Kurtz, K.L., ''Contemporary Marketing,'' Stamford, CT, Cengage, 2014, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Order getters'' refers to the in-field sales activity where a sales representative travels to the client's home or work place to makes a [[sales presentation]] in order to win new business or to maintain relations with existing clients.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, L.E. and Kurtz, K.L., ''Contemporary Marketing,'' Stamford, CT, Cengage, 2014, p. 580&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Missionary selling'' is often seen as a sales support role. The missionary sales person distributes information about products or services, describes product attributes and leaves materials but does not normally close the sale. The missionary sales person often prepares the way for a field sales person. For example, a pharmaceutical sales representative may call on doctors and leave samples, manufacturer information such as results of clinical trials, copies of relevant journal articles etc. in an effort to persuade doctors to prescribe a medication or course of treatment.
* ''Cold calling'' refers to a situation when a sales representative telephones or visits a customer without a prior appointment. [[Cold calling]] is often considered to be the most challenging of the sales activities. In a cold calling situation, the sales representative is likely to be more conscious of the client's time, and may seek to condense the sales process by combining the approach and the sales presentation into a single step.&lt;ref&gt;Boyan, L., ''Successful Cold Call Selling,'' American Management Association, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Relationship selling'' (also known as ''consultative selling'') refers to a sales practice that involves building and maintaining interactions with customers in order to enhance long term relationships. Relationship selling often involves a problem solving approach where the sales representative acts in a consultative role and becomes a partner in the client's problem-solving exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, C.W.L., Hair, J.F. and McDaniel, C., ''Marketing,'' South-Western, 2011, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Relationship selling is often found in high-tech selling environments.

==The sales process==

{{See also|Lead generation|Lead management|Sales presentation|Sales promotion}}
[[File:Steps in sales process.jpg|thumb|Steps in the sales process]]
The first text to outline the steps in the selling process was published in 1918 by Norval Watkins.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, W.A., ''Birth of a Salesman: The Transformation of Selling in America,'' p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; The basic steps, which have changed only a little since Watkins first proposed them, are prospecting, qualifying leads, preapproach, approach, need assessment, presentation, meeting objections, closing the sale and following up.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, L.E. and Kurtz, K.L., ''Contemporary Marketing,'' Stamford, CT, Cengage, 2014, p. 583&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Steve Jobs Presentation 1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Steve Jobs delivers one of his impressive sales presentations]]
:''Prospecting''–Identifying prospects or prospecting occurs when the sales person seeks to identify leads or prospects (i.e., people who are likely to be in the market for the offer). To identify prospects, sales representatives might use a variety of sources such as business directories (for corporate clients), commercial databases or mailing lists or simply look at internal records such as lists of lapsed customers. The aim of prospecting is to increase the likelihood that sales staff spend time with potential clients who have an interest in the product or service.

:''Qualifying leads''–After identifying potential customers, the sales team must determine whether prospects represent genuine potential customers. This part of the process is known as qualifying leads, or leads who are likely to buy. Qualified leads are those who have a need for the product, a capacity to pay and a willingness to pay for the product, and are willing to be contacted by the salesperson.&lt;ref name="Spiro2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=Management of a Sales Force|year=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin|author=Spiro, Roseann|edition=12th|author2=Gregory Rich |author3=Stanton, William }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Pre-approach''–Refers to the process of preparing for the presentation. This consists of customer research, goal planning, scheduling an appointment and any other tasks necessary to prepare for the sales presentation.

:''Approach''–Refers to the stage when the salesperson initially meets with the customer. Since first contact leaves an impression on the buyer, professional conduct, including attire, a handshake, and eye contact, is advised.&lt;ref name="Spiro2008" /&gt;

:''Need assessment''–An important component of the sales presentation is the assessment of the customer's needs.  Salespeople should evaluate the customer based on the need for the product. Sales representatives typically ask questions designed to reveal the prospective client's current situation, the source of any problems, the impact of the problems, the benefits of the solution, the client's prior experience with the brand or the category, the prospect's general level of interest and readiness to purchase.&lt;ref name="Spiro2008" /&gt; In the case of corporate clients, it may be necessary to ascertain any limitations on the prospect's authority to make a purchase (e.g. financial restrictions).

:''Sales presentation''–Once the salesperson knows the needs, he or she is ready for the presentation. Sales representatives often follow the [[AIDA (marketing)|AIDA]] model, which allows them to lead the prospect through the standard stages of the [[buyer decision process|purchase decision process]]. The steps in the AIDA process are to grab the customer’s '''A'''ttention, ignite '''I'''nterest, create '''D'''esire, and inspire '''A'''ction (AIDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Alex |url=http://www.udel.edu/alex/chapt20.html |title=Chapter 20, Personal Selling and Sales Management, Class Notes |deadurl=no |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The salesperson can do this through [[product demonstration]]s and presentations that show the features, advantages and benefits of the product.

:''Handling objections''–After the presentation, the sales person must be ready to handle any objections. Customers who are interested will voice their concerns, usually in one of four ways. They might question the price or value of the product, dismiss the product/service as inadequate, avoid making a commitment to buy, or refuse because of an unknown factor.&lt;ref name="Spiro2008"/&gt; Salespeople should do their best to anticipate objections and respectfully respond to them.

:''Closing''–When the sales person feels that the prospect is ready, they will seek to gain commitment and close the sale. If the sales person is unsure about the prospect's readiness to buy, they might consider using a 'trial close.' The salesperson can use several different techniques to close the sale; including the ‘alternative close’, the ‘assumptive close’, the ‘summary close’, or the ‘special-offer close’, among others.

:''Follow-up''–Finally, the salesperson must remember to follow up after the sale has been concluded. Following up will ensure customer satisfaction and help establish a relationship with the customer.

==Sales scripts==

[[File:A French itinerant medicine vendor on stage selling his ware Wellcome L0032279.jpg|thumb|Historically, itinerant medicine salesmen used tightly written scripts that induced audiences to buy]]
The use of tightly written sales scripts has been known for hundreds of years. Itinerant medicine salesmen were known to use sales scripts in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Experienced sales representatives soon recognise that specific words and phrases have the capacity to elicit desirable behaviours on the part of the prospect. Research studies can also be carried out to determine the most effective words/phrases or the optimal sequence of words/phrases for use in effective sales scripts. A number of research studies have focussed on the types of the use of verbal persuasive techniques that can be used to convince prospects such as information exchange, the use of recommendations, requests, promises, or ingratiation.&lt;ref&gt;Fennis, B.M. and Stel, M., "The Pantomime of Persuasion: Fit Between Nonverbal Communication and Influence Strategies," ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,'' 2011, doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2011.02.01&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has focused on influence techniques employed. Well-known examples include the:

:Door-In-The-Face–technique (DITF): where the target request is presented as a concession to an unreasonably large initial request&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B., Vincent, J. E., Lewis, S. K. Catal
an, J., Wheeler, D., &amp; Darby, B.L., "Reciprocal concessions procedure for inducing compliance: The Door-In-The-Face technique," ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,'' Vol. 31, pp 206-215&lt;/ref&gt;

:Disrupt-Then-Reframe–technique (DTR): where a conventional sales script is interrupted by a subtle, odd element (i.e., a disruptive element) and then followed by a persuasive phrase that concludes the script (i.e., “reframing”)&lt;ref&gt;Price-Davis, B.  and Knowles, E.S., "A Disrupt-Then-Reframe Technique of Social Influence,"  ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,'' Vol. 76, No. 2,  1999, pp 192-199&lt;/ref&gt;

Once identified, these words, phrases and techniques can be used to build highly effective sales scripts that are known to work.&lt;ref&gt;Niblick, J., ''The Profitable Consultant: Starting, Growing, and Selling Your Expertise,'' Wiley, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The most effective sales scripts can be codified and used by other sales persons or in sales training.

[[File:Borstelkoopman op de fiets - A brush salesman and his bicycle (4416872302).jpg|thumb|A brush salesman and his bicycle in the 1950s]]
Many sales scripts are designed to move the prospect sequentially through the cognitive, affective and behavioural stages of the purchase decision process and are designed around the AIDA model (attention →interest →desire →action). Most sales representatives include a greeting, closing and [[Call to action (marketing)|call to action]] in their scripts. A ''call to action'' (CTA) is simply an instruction to the prospect designed to prompt an immediate response. It often involves the use of an [[imperative verb]] such as "try it now" or  "find out more."&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, B., ''CALL TO ACTION: Secret Formulas to Improve Online Results,'' Nashville, Tennessee, Thomas Nelson, 2006, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of calls-to-action might provide consumers with strong reasons for purchasing immediately such an offer that is only available for a limited time, e.g. 'Limited stocks available' or a special deal usually accompanied by a time constraint, e.g. 'Order before midnight to receive a free gift with your order'. The key to a powerful call-to-action is to provide consumers with compelling reasons to purchase promptly rather than defer purchase decisions.

Sales representatives also learn to recognise specific verbal and non-verbal cues that potentially signal the prospect's readiness to buy. For instance, if a prospect begins to handle the merchandise, this may indicate a state of buyer interest. Clients also tend to employ different types of questions throughout the sales process. General questions such as, "Does it come in any other colours (or styles)? indicate only a moderate level of interest. However, when clients begin to ask specific questions, such as "Do you have this model in black?" then this indicates that the prospect is approaching readiness to buy.&lt;ref&gt;Cant, M.C. and van Heerden, C.H., ''Personal Selling,'' Juta Academic, 2008, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; When the sales person believes that the prospective buyer is ready to make the purchase, a ''trial close'' might be used to test the waters. A trial close is simply any attempt to confirm the buyer's interest in finalising the sale. An example of a trial close, is "Would you be requiring our team to install the unit for you?" or "Would you be available to take delivery next Thursday?"

Sales scripts are used for both inbound and outbound sales. Sales scripts are commonly used in cold calling, especially phone-based cold calling such as telemarketing (outbound selling) and can also be found in chat-based customer care centres (inbound calling). In such cases, the sales script might be confined to a simple list of talking points that the sales person uses as a reference during their conversation with the prospect.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, P., "What are Sales Scripts?," Tenfold Blog, &lt;Online: https://www.tenfold.com/what-is/sales-scripts-definition&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===

[[File:The Rawleigh Man.JPG|thumb|By 1915, an estimated 2,000 "Rawleigh men" distributed Rawleigh products while visiting approximately 20,000 customers daily]]
Some sales pitches are entirely scripted while others are only partially scripted allowing the individual sales representatives the flexibility to vary the presentation according to their assessment of the client's needs and interests. However, most effective sales representatives develop scripts for handling common objections and almost always have a number of different trial closes at hand.

There are three broad types of sales script:&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, M. R., Surprenant, C. F., Czepiel, J.A. and Suprenant, C.F. "A Role Theory Perspective on Dyadic Interactions: The Service Encounter” (1991) in Bateson, J, Managing Services Marketing: Text, Cases and Readings, Dryden, Orlando, Fl, pp 106- 122&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prescribed scripts====

Prescribed scripts are highly detailed scripts which specify precise phrases to be used in given situations. Prescribed scripts are widely used in a variety of contexts including direct selling, market research, fast food service.

The main advantages of prescribed scripts are:
* can enable speedy transactions
* provides uniform delivery. 
The main disadvantages of a prescribed script are:
* tendency for the delivery to become robotic and lacking in authenticity

====Goal-driven scripts====

Goal driven scripts are more flexible. This type of script defines the goals for each type of transaction and allow employees to use their own phrases during the encounter. Provided that employees have a clear picture of the goals and purpose, goal-driven scripts can appear more natural and authentic. However the use of goal-driven scripts requires employees with well developed communication skills.

====Hybrid approach====

The hybrid approach offers a choice within a range of scripts. This approach is neither prescribed nor totally flexible. It provides a range of scripts from which employees select an option with which they feel comfortable.

'''Pery Igel''' (November 27, 1921 – September 24, 1998) was a Brazilian businessman. Igel was [[Ultrapar|Ultra]]'s second president, succeeding his father and company's founder, [[Ernesto Igel]].

==Biography==
Igel was the administrator and second president of Ultra. He took over the company created by his father, [[Ernesto Igel]], in 1959. After two years as president, Igel moved the headquarters from Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo, Brazil.&lt;ref name=DiskBrasilGas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diskbrasilgas.com.br/historia/index.htm|title=História|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Pery’s administration, [[Oxiteno]] and Ultracargo were founded, two of the five divisions of Ultra, along with [[Ultragaz]] (first division of Ultra), as well as [[Petróleo Ipiranga|Ipiranga]] and [[Extrafarma]], which were incorporated to the group respectively in 2007 and 2014.

Under his administration, the company created and also dissociated a number of other activities that have stopped being related to Ultra's long-term strategy, such as a domestic appliances retailer (Ultralar), an engineering company (Ultratec), a frozen food organization (Supergel,) and the fertilizer industry (Ultrafértil.)&lt;ref name=EconomiaiG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economia.ig.com.br/com-acordo-de-acionista-prorrogado-ultra-planejara-seu-futuro-nos-proximos-dois-anos/n1237575355745.html |title=Com acordo de acionista prorrogado,Ultra planejará seu futuro dos próximos dois anos|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Igel stepped down as CEO in 1981 and appointed Vice President [[Paulo Cunha (businessman)|Paulo Cunha]] to the position. Igel became president of the Ultra's Board of Directors and remained its main [[shareholder]].&lt;ref name=Valor&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valor.com.br/sites/default/files/upload_element/22-02_ultrapar_balanco_ok_todos.pdf|title=Ultrapar em 2012 |accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Após deixar a presidência executiva, Pery seguiu como presidente do Conselho Administrativo do Ultra e seu principal acionista.&lt;ref name=GoogleNews&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1246&amp;dat=19980926&amp;id=imYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-rcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6513,1677535&amp;hl=pt-BR|title=País perde um de seus maiores empresários |accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his death in September 1998, Igel transferred the controlling shares of Ultra to his family and to a small group of Ultra executives through the creation of a holding company.&lt;ref name="PacíficoGestãodeRecursos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pagr.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pacifico-Acoes-1T14.pdf|title=Pacífico Ações |accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Administradores&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.administradores.com.br/artigos/economia-e-financas/sucessao-empresarial-como-manter-o-negocio-nas-proximas-geracoes/36933/|title=Sucessão empresarial: como manter o negócios nas próximas gerações. |accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geein.fclar.unesp.br/jornais_det.php?codigo=7781|title=Igel faz madeira plástica com reciclados |accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rashid Lombard''' (born 1951) is known as both a jazz photographer and political photojournalist. Lombard is the CEO of espAfrika, an events management company which he started in 1997. espAfrika is responsible for staging the [[Cape Town International Jazz Festival]], formerly known as the North Sea Jazz Cape Town.

&lt;!-- If you need section use == Section_title == as below --&gt;

==Background ==

Rashid Lombard was born in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, South Africa on 10 April 1951. His family moved to Cape Town in the early 1960s. Lombard trained as an architectural draughtsman and then worked as an industrial photographer for the construction company, Murray and Roberts, before becoming a photojournalist covering Africa, and, particularly, South Africa where he focussed on photographing the rise of the democratic movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South African History|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/rashid-lombard|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
In the 1980s he worked for the BBC, NBC, AFP and a number of progressive publications such as ''Grassroots'' and ''South''. His work has been part of exhibitions all over southern Africa, including the University of Zimbabwe in 1983 and the [[Staffrider]] exhibitions of 1984 and 1985. In 1985 his work formed part of the exhibition and book, ''South Africa: The Cordoned Heart, Essays by Twenty South African Photographers'', edited by [[Omar Badsha]] and published in New York. He was a member of the ''Vukalisa'' artists' collective which promoted community-based cultural activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South African History Online|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/rashid-lombard|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cape Town International Jazz Festival==
In the mid 1990s he became station manager at [[Fine Music Radio]], and then programming manager at P4 Smooth Jazz Radio. In 1998 Lombard approached the director of the North Sea Jazz Festival to stage a local festival in Cape Town. This was the start of the Cape Town International Jazz Festival, now in its 14th year. The Mandela Bay Music Festival was launched in Port Elizabeth, his home town, in 2011 with George Benson playing to a 28 000 strong crowd. Similar jazz festivals have been held in Mozambique and Angola and there are plans to expand into the rest of Africa including Namibia, Tanzania and Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Daily Maverick|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-04-03-maverick-interview-rashid-lombard/#.UXZX4aJmiSo|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cape Town International Jazz Festival brings more than 40 musicians to perform over two days attracting in excess of 30 000 people. It has been ranked in 2007 fourth in the world, below Montreaux and New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and above the North Sea jazz Festival.  Part of the week-long program focuses on workshops, training and mentoring sessions to develop music appreciation and performance. Top performers at the 2013 festival included the Buena Vista Social Club, Mi Casa, Jimmy Dludlu, Jill Scott, and Gregory Porter.

==Jazz Photography==
Lombard has photographed both local and international musicians, and has paid particular attention to recording South African musicians-in-exile like [[Hugh Masekela]], [[Miriam Makeba]] and [[Abdullah Ibrahim]]. In 2010, he contributed to the exhibition at the Duotone Gallery at the Cape Town International Jazz Festival which paid tribute to South African saxophonist, Hugh Masekela.

His book of jazz photographs, ''Jazz Rocks'', was published in 2010 by espAfrika and Highbury/Safika Media.  [[James Matthews (writer)|James Matthews]], South African poet and writer, in the foreword to the book observed that "Lombard's collection of photographs...is an ode to South Africa's jazz musicians...Each and every lovingly taken photo displays its empathy with the music and the players. As a photographer I don't think Rashid was ever really objective, he is far too personally engaged with his subjects for that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lombard|first=Rashid|title=Jazz Rocks|year=2010|publisher=Highbury Safika Media|location=Cape Town|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jazz Rocks'' was edited by fellow photographer, [[George Hallett (Cape Town)|George Hallett]], who amongst others has won an award for his photographs of [[Nelson Mandela]] and worked on the [[Nobel Peace Centre]] project. The book chronicles the period from the early 1980s to roughly 2004. It is intended as a tribute to some of the musicians who Lombard has worked with and the important role that music played in the anti-apartheid struggle.

In his own words: "Over the years I have spent so much time backstage that the space behind the music is a part of me. Many of the musicians I photographed were far more than just subjects to me. The musicians became my friends and family. We spent many hours honing our skills and teaching each other the politics of the arts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lombard|first=Rashid|title=Jazz Rocks|year=2010|publisher=Highbury Safika Media|location=Cape Town|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rear Admiral '''Richard Wainwright''' (17 December 1849 – 6 March 1926), son of Commander [[Richard Wainwright (naval officer, Civil War)|Richard Wainwright]], was an officer in the [[United States Navy]] during the [[Spanish–American War]].

==Biography==
===Early life and ancestors===
Born in [[Washington, D.C.]], the son of Sarah Franklin Bache and [[Richard Wainwright (American Civil War naval officer)|Richard Wainwright]]. He was the grandson of [[Richard Bache Jr. (Texas politician)|Richard Bache, Jr.]], who served in the [[Republic of Texas]] Navy and was elected as a Representative to the Second Texas Legislature in 1847 and Sophia Burrell Dallas, the daughter of Arabella Maria Smith and [[Alexander J. Dallas (statesman)|Alexander J. Dallas]] an American statesman who served as the U.S. Treasury Secretary under President [[James Madison]]. He was great-grandson of [[Sarah Franklin Bache]] and [[Richard Bache]], the great-great-grandson of [[Benjamin Franklin]], and a nephew of [[George Mifflin Dallas]] the 11th [[Vice President of the United States]] who served under [[James K. Polk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Descendants of Signers of the Declaration of Independence|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1911-07-02/ed-1/seq-50/|accessdate=20 May 2015|work=Evening star.|date=2 July 1911|location=Washington, D.C.|page=6 (Part 4)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Wainwright was appointed to the [[US Naval Academy]] in 1864 by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and graduated near the top of his class in 1868. Wainwright's early career is not well documented.  From 1890 to 1893 he commanded the {{USS|Alert|AS-4|2}}, and in 1896 he became the [[Office of Naval Intelligence|Chief Intelligence Officer of the Navy]]. In November 1897, he was ordered to the Armored Cruiser {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|2}}, to serve as executive officer under Captain [[ Charles Dwight Sigsbee|Charles D. Sigsbee]].&lt;ref name=Princeton/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fighting Dick"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fighting Dick Wainwright on Navy Retired List|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045433/1911-12-17/ed-1/seq-2/|accessdate=20 May 2015|work=The Washington Herald|date=17 December 1911|location=Washington, D.C.|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish–American War==
On the night the ''Maine'' was blown up in [[Havana]] harbor, Wainwright stood beside Sigsbee on the quarterdeck as the vessel was sinking. It was Wainwright who issued the order to lower the lifeboats in which the surviving crew escaped. From the beginning, Wainwright believed the ''Maine'' was not blown up by accident and he was impatient to avenge the death of the officers, bluejackets and Marines who died as a result.

In the interval between the blowing up of the Maine and the [[ Spanish–American War|declaration of war]] against [[Spain]], Wainwright was assigned command of the tender {{USS|Fern|1871|2}} and placed in charge of the salvage survey and recovery of the bodies of the victims.&lt;ref name=DANFS2&gt;{{Cite DANFS|title=Wainwright|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/w/wainwright-i.html|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Wrecked Maine: Board of Survey Will Determine Her Final Disposition|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058130/1898-03-28/ed-1/seq-2/|accessdate=21 May 2015|work=The Salt Lake Herald|date=28 March 1898|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed aboard throughout the seven weeks long [[USS Maine (ACR-1)#1898 Sampson Board's Court of Inquiry|Sampson court of inquiry]], never setting foot in ashore. As the initial salvage closed, for concern about oncoming war, Wainwright remained. On the day that the last salvage team was ordered home, the Spanish naval commander in Havana, [[Admiral Vincente Manterola]], ordered the American flag, which was still flying from the rigging of the wrecked ''Maine'', [[Striking the colors|struck]]. Wainwright heard of the order and, calling an interpreter, issued an order that immediately made him famous,&lt;ref name=Princeton&gt;{{cite news|title=Wainwright to Leave the Navy|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83016758/1911-12-21/ed-1/seq-10/|accessdate=20 May 2015|work=The Princeton Union|date=21 December 1911|location=Princeton, Minnesota|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 {{pull quote|Tell the officer in charge of the guard that if any Spaniard touches the flag that flies from that wreck, there will be another wreck in Havana harbor. Tell him I will sink his barge myself if he attempts to carry out that order.}}

When Wainwright did finally leave Havana, he hauled down the flag himself. On his arrival in Washington, the U. S. Navy was in the process of purchasing vessels that could be used in the war. Among them was a yacht, the ''Corsair'', owned by [[J. P. Morgan]]. She was converted into a gunboat, renamed the {{USS|Gloucester|1891|2}}, and commissioned with Wainwright in command. In the [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]] he engaged the Spanish [[torpedo-boat destroyers|torpedo boats]] [[Spanish destroyer Furor|''Furor'']] and [[Spanish destroyer Plutón|''Plutón'']], driving them ashore as wrecks with her battery of 6-pounders.&lt;ref name=MEL&gt;{{cite journal |year=1898 |title=Armed Yacht vs. Torpedo-Boat Destroyers |journal=Marine Engineering |volume=2 |issue=August 1898 |page=15 |publisher=Marine Publishing Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=otg2AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA6-PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victory came with no casualties, which was attributed to "The accuracy and rapidity of her fire, making the proper service of the guns on the [[Spain|Spanish]] ships impossible." Wainwright was commended for his valor in this action&lt;ref name=Princeton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gloucester&gt;{{Cite DANFS|title=Gloucester (Gbt) i|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/g/gloucester-i.html|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was advanced by ten numbers on the promotion seniority list.&lt;ref name=Tucker&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Tucker|editor1-first=Spencer C.|editor2-last=Arnold|editor2-first=James|editor3-last=Wiener|editor3-first=Roberta|editor4-last=Pierpaoli Jr.|editor4-first=Paul G.|editor5-last=McCallum|editor5-first=Jack|editor6-last=Murphy|editor6-first=Justin D.|title=The Encyclopedia of the Spanish–American and Philippine–American Wars a Political, Social, and Military History|date=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=9781851099528|page=685|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYfSbFGFWlUC|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ordering his heavily damaged flagship [[Spanish cruiser Infanta Maria Teresa|''Infanta Maria Teresa'']] to run aground, Spanish fleet commander [[Pascual Cervera y Topete|Spanish Admiral Cervera]], was picked up by the ''Gloucester''.  Wainwright was there to greet him as he was brought aboard. "I congratulate you, sir," said the American, "on having made as gallant a fight as was ever seen on the sea."&lt;ref name=Princeton/&gt;

==1900-1911==
From 1900–1902, Wainwright was Superintendent of United States Naval Academy. During this time, the submarine boat {{USS|Holland|SS-1|2}} was in Annapolis to train crews for submarines then under construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Holland Off for Annapolis|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1900-10-20/ed-1/seq-6/|accessdate=4 June 2015|work=New-York Tribune|date=October 20, 1900|location=New York, NY|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wainwright, having this opportunity to observe their operation, fully endorsed them for their planned harbor defense role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Submarine Boats for Harbor Defense|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84020274/1902-06-11/ed-1/seq-8/|accessdate=4 June 2015|work=The St. Louis Republic|date=June 11, 1902|location=[[St. Louis, Missouri]]|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 he commanded American forces during the [[Santo Domingo Affair]] in which his ships shelled rebel troops and supported an [[amphibious assault]]. Later, promoted to rear admiral, he commanded the Second Division of the [[Great White Fleet]] during that fleet's historic voyage around the world from 1907-1909.&lt;ref name=DANFS2/&gt;

'''Dr. Sadad Ibrahim Al Husseini''' is a leading [[Saudis|Saudi]] oil and gas industry expert.  He is most widely known for his achievements during his tenure at Saudi Aramco as the Senior and Executive Vice President for Exploration and Producing, and his current work on supply side risk; referred to by the New York Times as “one of the most respected and accomplished oilmen in the world”.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, Aug. 21, 2005,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/21/magazine/the-breaking-point.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
He is credited with launching the field modernization and state of art reservoir management and development of Saudi Arabia’s giant oil fields,&lt;ref&gt;Aramco World Magazine, May–June 1984&lt;/ref&gt; the upgrading of the company’s drilling, environmental, and upstream safety standards, the discovery and development of its Paleozoic oil and gas reservoirs,&lt;ref&gt;The Arabian Sun, November 29, 1989 and AIME, www.aimehq.org&lt;/ref&gt; the discovery of its Red Sea oil and condensate fields,&lt;ref&gt;The Arabian Sun, Special Issue Commemorating Saudi Aramco’s 60th Year, May 26, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; the initiation of its upstream advanced degree and specialists professional programs, and the development of its leading edge reservoir modelling and simulation capabilities at its purpose built Exploration and Petroleum Engineering Center,EXPEC.&lt;ref&gt;Al Youm Newspaper, Dammam, March 28, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Arabian Sun, Special Issue Commemorating Saudi Aramco’s 60th Year, May 26, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Arabian Sun, September 22, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 he launched Aramco’s mothballing program for 3.5 million barrels of oil production capacity and in 1990, as a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, he led the Aramco team that re-activated the mothballed capacity thereby increasing Kingdom’s oil production from 5 million bd to 8.5 million bd within six months.&lt;ref&gt;Miscellaneous Report, Executive Committee, Saudi Arabia Oil Company, February 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 he launched the intensified non-associated Saudi gas exploration program which increased the Kingdom’s non-associated gas reserves by 30 Tcf within 4 years.

In 1996,Al Husseini was called upon by HM King Abdullah ibn Abdul Aziz to provide advisory support to the Kingdom’s leadership for the purpose of expanding its economy through a broader exploitation of its proven gas reserves. This culminated in the Kingdom’s Natural Gas Initiative in 1999&lt;ref&gt;Shell in the Middle East, No.15 – Oct. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  which invited international oil companies to participate in the development of the Kingdom’s non-associated gas reservoirs and the expansion of its power generation, desalination and petrochemical sectors. Following on his retirement from Saudi Aramco in 2004, Dr.Al Husseini co-founded and is president of Husseini Energy Company, a highly specialized oil and gas consulting firm based in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.

In July 30, 2018, Al Hussenini said, “Rather than allowing these hostile maneuvers to go unnoticed in the eyes of the world, the Saudi (energy) minister has placed Iran’s subversions of the whole global economy under the spotlight for everyone to see,” “The capture of the port of Hodeidah will go a long way towards putting an end to these disruptions".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-oil-explainer/why-is-saudi-halting-oil-shipments-through-the-red-sea-idUSKBN1KK1ND&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Dr Sadad Al Husseini was born in Damascus in 1946 to Col. Ibrahim Abdulrahman Al Husseini and Myassar BachImam. His father was a leading Syrian nationalist and member of the Syrian military and political leadership until 1957.  Al Husseini attended primary and secondary education at Notre Dame International School in Rome, Italy between 1955 and 1964. He and his family moved to Saudi Arabia in 1961 when King Faisal bin Abdul Aziz invited Col. Ibrahim Al Husseini to advise the Saudi Arabian Council of Ministers on national security matters and to support Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud as his special advisor in the establishment of the modern Saudi Arabian National Guard.&lt;ref&gt;A Soldier in Arabia: A British Military Memoir from Jordan to Saudi Arabia. Author: Nigel Bromage and the WSJ article&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wikileaks==
On February 8, 2011 The Guardian newspaper published US cables from Saudi Arabia that were obtained by WikiLeaks. The cables were based on a conversation attributed to Dr Sadad Al Husseini in 2007 claiming Dr Husseini thought Aramco’s reserves were overstated by as much as 300 billion barrels.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, February 8, 2011, https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/feb/08/saudi-oil-reserves-overstated-wikileaks&lt;/ref&gt; The story gained traction in the press and caused tremendous damage to Dr Husseini’s reputation within the Kingdom. Dr Sadad Al Husseini maintained that the US cable gravely misrepresented his opinion and that the report was full of errors and rooky mistakes including quoting resource figures as reserve figures.Subsequently, Dr Sadad Al Husseini’s firm published a press release on February 9, 2011 in response to the significant errors in the cable and clarified Dr Sadad’s position on Saudi Arabia’s reserves and production capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Husseini Energy website,http://www.husseinienergy.com/media-center/in-the-press/press-release-by-dr-sadad-al-husseini/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6675">'''Senior peer counseling, a.k.a. Peer counseling for seniors,''' provides [[Senior Citizens|senior citizens]] with a trained volunteer counselor to provide assistance with [[emotional support]] and encouragement to those who are experiencing life changes that often accompany [[Ageing|aging]].  Seniors typically use counseling to discover ways to deal with [[grief]], loss, physical limitations, financial issues, mild [[Depression (mood)|depression]], family relationships, [[loneliness]], isolation, housing situations, [[anxiety]], change in [[cognitive function]], and [[Caregiving|care giving]] for a spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garcia|first=Y.|title=A senior peer counseling program: Evaluation of training and benefits to counselors|journal=Educational Gerontology|date=1997|volume=23 |page=329|issue=4 |doi=10.1080/0360127970230403 |last2=Metha |first2=Arlene |last3=Perfect |first3=Maureen C.|last4=McWhirter|first4=J. Jeffries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The original idea of Senior Peer Counseling was developed in 1977 by Evelyn Freeman, Ph.D. (1917–2013). She first created a program called Senior Health and Peer Counseling of [[Santa Monica, California]]. In 1986 in collaboration with others, she produced "Peer Counseling for Seniors: A Trainer's Guide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mai-Duc|first=Christine|title=Evelyn Freeman dies at 96; therapist was pioneer in aging issues|url=https://a1seniorcare.com/evelyn-freeman-dies-at-96/ |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 4, 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, various groups utilized her trainer's guide and Senior Peer Counseling programs became available in many California counties as well as in South Carolina, Colorado, Oregon, New Mexico, and Washington. The program is also available in Europe, Canada, and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaspc-programs.org/storyofspc.html|title=The Story of SPC|publisher=American Association of Senior Peer Counseling|accessdate=August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sponsorship of the program in those locations comes from county health services, interfaith councils, senior citizen advocacy groups, and non-profit organizations. These Senior Peer Counseling programs vary widely in their methods, and no one program is alike. However, they all operate in the spirit of Evelyn Freeman's vision of Senior Peer Counseling. In addition, even though no two programs are exactly alike, there is an organization called the American Association of Senior Peer Counseling that tries to bring together all of the various Senior Peer Counseling agencies to share opportunities for networking and information.

== Program design characteristics ==

In general, Senior Peer Counseling volunteers are trained to provide one-on-one, (counselor and client) confidential counseling to other persons 50 years of age or older.&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Evelyn|title=Peer Counseling for Seniors:A Trainer's Guide|date=1995|publisher=Senior Health and Peer Counseling|location=Santa Monica, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counseling sessions are [[goal-oriented]] or [[Supportive psychotherapy|supportive]] and are in general one hour per week. The sessions are held in the client's home, a senior citizen center, or another confidential setting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grady|first=S.|title=Senior Centers: An Environment for Counseling|journal=Generations: Journal of the American Society on Aging|date=1990|volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=15–18|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~leisure/module2/unit3_LA2/readings/Grady.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are closely supervised by professionals, i.e., psychologists, marriage and family therapists, or social workers, who intervene, as appropriate, with suggestions about how to handle situations with clients or to provide resources.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;
Confidentiality is only broken in exceptional circumstances, such as when there is suspected [[Child abuse|child]] or [[elder abuse]] or when the client reports he or she is at risk of [[suicide]], [[homicide]], or [[grave disability]]. In these events, counselings have specific reporting instructions to assure the safety of everyone concerned.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;
Referrals to Senior Peer Counseling programs are often made by [[Adult Protective Services]] agencies, [[Home health nursing|home health]] workers, hospitals, [[Social work|social workers]], registered nurses, [[Retirement home|senior housing]], or other agencies serving senior citizens. Elders may become aware of the program through postings in senior citizen centers, senior housing, or other agencies serving senior citizens, and may self-refer into the program.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;

== Effectiveness ==

Seniors counseling can be effective because the counselors often have had life experiences similar to their clients. In contrast, professional counselors may unintentionally create a power imbalance with older clients unfamiliar with formal counseling and many senior clients will not seek formal counseling due to cost or perceived [[Social stigma|stigma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratter|first=B.|title=The Maturing of Peer Counseling|journal=Generations|date=1990|volume=14 |issue=1 |page=49|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1990-20670-001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior peer counseling programs, therefore, may provide a more comfortable and supportive environment for the client.

In 2010-2011, Applied Survey Research (ASR) conducted a study of 43 senior peer counseling clients in [[San Mateo County, California]]. The study concluded that the clients had discussed personal issues in their lives more often with their senior peer counselors than with anyone else including family, friends, and neighbors. The study also found that 75% of the clients had reported the senior peer counseling had "helped a lot", especially with their concerns about food, health, loneliness, and sadness. Twenty-three percent reported it had "helped a little bit" and 3% reported it "had not helped at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Peninsula Family Service Senior Peer Counseling Program: Results of the 2010-2011 Client Survey|url=http://www.appliedsurveyresearch.org/storage/database/health/peninsulafamilyservice/ThePeninsulaFamilyServiceSeniorPeerCounseling.pdf|publisher=Applied Survey Research (ASR)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108184355/http://www.appliedsurveyresearch.org/storage/database/health/peninsulafamilyservice/ThePeninsulaFamilyServiceSeniorPeerCounseling.pdf|archivedate=2014-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32241">'''Small and medium-sized enterprises''' ('''SMEs''') or '''small and medium-sized businesses''' ('''SMBs''') are [[business]]es whose personnel numbers fall below certain limits. The abbreviation "SME" is used by international organizations such as the [[World Bank]], the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).

SMEs outnumber large companies by a wide margin and also employ many more people. For example, Australian SMEs make up 97% of all Australian businesses, produced one third of total GDP, and employ 4.7 million people. In Chile, in the commercial year 2014, 98.5% of the firms were classified as SMEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Chile|date=2016-04-14|url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/industry-and-services/financing-smes-and-entrepreneurs-2016/chile_fin_sme_ent-2016-11-en|work=Financing SMEs and Entrepreneurs|pages=155–173|publisher=OECD Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1787/fin_sme_ent-2016-11-en|isbn=9789264249462|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tunisia, the self-employed workers alone account for about 28% of the total non-farm employment and firms with fewer than 100 employees account for about 62% of total employment.&lt;ref&gt;Rijkers et al (2014): "Which firms create the most jobs in developing countries?", ''Labour Economics'', Volume 31, December 2014, pp.84–102&lt;/ref&gt; In developing countries, smaller (micro) and informal firms, have a larger share than in developed countries&lt;!-- need citations --&gt;. SMEs are also said to be responsible for driving innovation and competition in many economic sectors. Although they create more jobs, there is also a majority of job destruction/contraction.&lt;ref&gt;Aga et al (2015): [https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/~/media/GIAWB/EnterpriseSurveys/Documents/ResearchPapers/SMEs-age-and-jobs.pdf SMEs, Age, and Jobs: A Review of the Literature, Metrics, and Evidence], World Bank Group, November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}
SMEs are important for economic and social reasons, given the sectors role in employment. Due to their sizes, SME are heavily influenced by their Chief Executive Officers, a.k.a. CEOs. The CEOs of SMEs often are the founders, owners, and manager of the SMEs. The duties of a CEO in SME is difficult just like the CEOs of big companies. A CEO needs to strategically allocate her/his time, energy, and assets to direct the SMEs. Typically, the CEO Is the strategist, champion and leader for developing the SME or the prime reason for the business failing{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

At the employee level, Petrakis and Kostis (2012) explore the role of interpersonal trust and knowledge in the number of small and medium enterprises. They conclude that knowledge positively affects the number of SMEs, which in turn, positively affects interpersonal trust. Note that the empirical results indicate that interpersonal trust does not affect the number of SMEs. Therefore, although knowledge development can reinforce SMEs, trust becomes widespread in a society when the number of SMEs is greater.&lt;ref&gt;P.E. Petrakis, P.C. Kostis (2012), “[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13132-012-0115-6 Τhe Role of Knowledge and Trust in SMEs]”, Journal of the Knowledge Economy, DOI: 10.1007/s13132-012-0115-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SME leadership ===
SMEs' top management teams' leadership styles have an essential effect on business success and the development of SMEs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Jianhong|last2=Nadkarni|first2=Sucheta|date=2017-03-01|title=It’s about Time! CEOs’ Temporal Dispositions, Temporal Leadership, and Corporate Entrepreneurship|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839216663504|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|language=en|volume=62|issue=1|pages=31–66|doi=10.1177/0001839216663504|issn=0001-8392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many SMEs do not have a board and rely on its top management team (TMT), the top managers of a firm, to make the strategic decisions.

== SME strategies ==
To thrive in our changing and complex business world, the modern SME must formulate strategies on where it wants to be in its marketplace. Its leadership then needs to acquire, and use wisely, the right human, financial and other resources to get there.

=== Flexibility ===
SMEs face a lot of uncertainty and need to be flexible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nadkarni|first=Sucheta|last2=Herrmann|first2=Pol|date=2010-10|title=CEO Personality, Strategic Flexibility, and Firm Performance: The Case of the Indian Business Process Outsourcing Industry|url=https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMJ.2010.54533196|journal=Academy of Management Journal|language=en|volume=53|issue=5|pages=1050–1073|doi=10.5465/amj.2010.54533196|issn=0001-4273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ambidexterity ===
SMEs need to balance many things at the same time, and being ambidextrous at tasks is key.

===[[Dynamic capabilities|Dynamic capability]]===
In our changing and complex business world, the modern SME should have the ability to change themselves.

=== Innovation/[[corporate entrepreneurship]]===
While startups are known for their innovation, SMEs often are small and focused enough to bring out innovation as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chin|first=M. K.|last2=Zhang|first2=Stephen Xu|last3=Afshar Jahanshahi|first3=Asghar|last4=Nadkarni|first4=Sucheta|date=2018-07|title=The Effect of Two Dimensions of CEO Political Ideology on Corporate Entrepreneurship|url=https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMBPP.2018.39|journal=Academy of Management Proceedings|language=en|volume=2018|issue=1|pages=12910|doi=10.5465/ambpp.2018.39|issn=0065-0668}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===[[Bribery]]===
Bribery is an often-quiet but prevalent strategies of SMEs in many parts of the world.

===[[E-commerce|E-Commerce]] and online strategy ===
In the internet and mobile world, SMEs face unique motivation and barriers in their [[e-commerce]] and online strategy. SMEs find an "enhanced company brand and corporate image" to be the most important e-commerce advantage, whereas "doubts about the security and privacy" is the most important barrier for SMEs to have an e-commerce and online strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Afshar Jahanshahi|first=Asghar|last2=X.

=== Africa ===
{{refimprove section|date = May 2015}}

==== Egypt ====
Most of Egypt's businesses are small-sized, with 97 percent employing fewer than 10 workers, according to census data released by state-run statistics body CAPMAS.

Medium-sized enterprises with 10 to 50 employees account for around 2.7 percent of total businesses. However, big businesses with over 50 employees account for 0.4 percent of all enterprises nationwide.

The data is part of Egypt's 2012/13 economic census on establishments ranging from small stalls to big enterprises. Economic activity outside the establishments – like street vendors and farmers, for example – were excluded from the census.

The results show that Egypt is greatly lacking in medium-sized businesses.

Seventy percent of the country's 2.4 million businesses have only one or two employees. But less than 0.1 percent – only 784 businesses – employ between 45 and 49 people.

==== Kenya ====
In Kenya, the term changed to MSME, which stands for "micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises".

For micro enterprises, the maximum number of employees is up to 10 employees. For small enterprises, it is from 10 to 50. For medium enterprises, it is from 50 to 100.

==== Nigeria ====
The [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] defines small and medium enterprises in Nigeria according to asset base and number of staff employed. The criteria are an asset base that is between [[Naira|N5]]&amp;nbsp;million to [[Naira|N500]] million, and a staff strength that is between 11 and 100 employees.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2010/publications/guidelines/dfd/GUIDELINES%20ON%20N200%20BILLION%20SME%20CREDIT%20GUARANTEE.pdf|title=N200 BILLION SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES CREDIT GUARANTEE SCHEME(SMECGS)|last=Central Bank Of Nigeria|first=|date=March 30, 2010|website=|publisher=Central Bank of Nigeria|access-date=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Somalia ====
In Somalia, the term is SME (for "small, medium, and micro enterprises"); elsewhere in Africa, MSME stands for "micro, small, and medium enterprises". An SME is defined as a small business that has more than 30 employees but less than 500 employees.

==== South Africa ====

In the National Small Business Amendment Act 26 0f 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Republic of South Africa, National Small Business Amendment Act|url=http://www.thedti.gov.za/business_regulation/acts/small_business_amendment_act.pdf|publisher=www.thedti.gov.za|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''micro-businesses''' in the different sectors, varying from the manufacturing to the retail sectors, are defined as businesses with five or fewer employees and a turnover of up to R100,000 [[South African Rand|ZAR]]. '''Very small businesses''' employ between 6 and 20 employees, while '''small businesses''' employ between 21 and 50 employees. The upper limit for turnover in a small business varies from R1 million in the Agricultural sector to R13 million in the Catering, Accommodations and other Trade sector as well as in the Manufacturing sector, with a maximum of R32 million in the Wholesale Trade sector.

'''Medium-sized businesses''' usually employ up to 200 people (100 in the Agricultural sector), and the maximum turnover varies from R5 million in the Agricultural sector to R51 million in the Manufacturing sector and R64 million in the Wholesale Trade, Commercial Agents and Allied Services sector.

A comprehensive definition of an SME in South Africa is therefore any enterprise with one or more of the following characteristics: 
* Fewer than 200 employees
* Annual turnover of less than R64 million
* Capital assets of less than R10 million
* Direct managerial involvement by owners&lt;ref&gt;Du Toit.Erasmus.&amp; Strydom "Definition of a small business" ''Introduction to business management, 7th Edition'' Oxford University press,2009, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===

==== India ====
Under section 7 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006, the Indian government defined the size of micro, small, and medium enterprises as:&lt;ref name="MSMED-Act"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.msmeodisha.gov.in/PDF/MSMED_Act.pdf | title=THE MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT ACT, 2006 | journal=The Gazette of India |date=June 2006  | volume=31 | pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|(a) in the case of the enterprises engaged in the manufacture of goods pertaining to any industry specified in the First Schedule to the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951, as—

(i) a micro enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery does not exceed twenty-five lakh rupees

(ii) a small enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery is more than twenty-five lakh rupees but does not exceed five crore rupees; or

(iii) a medium enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery is more than five crore rupees but does not exceed ten crore rupees;

(ii) a small enterprise, where the investment in equipment is more than ten lakh rupees but does not exceed two crore rupees; or

(iii) a medium enterprise, where the investment in equipment is more than two crore rupees but does not exceed five crore rupees.}}

Businesses that are declared as MSMEs and within specific sectors and criteria can then apply for "priority sector" lending to help with business expenses; banks have annual targets set by the Prime Minister's Task Force on MSMEs for year-on-year increases of lending to various categories of MSMEs.&lt;ref name=MSMED-RBI&gt;{{cite web|title=Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/commonman/English/scripts/FAQs.aspx?Id=966|publisher=Reserve Bank of India|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indonesia ====

In Indonesia, the government defines micro, small, and medium enterprises ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Usaha Mikro Kecil dan Menengah'', UMKM) based on their assets and revenues according to Law No. 20/2008:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesian Government Law No. 20 of 2008|url=http://eng.kppu.go.id/newkppu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LAW-OF-THE-REPUBLIC-OF-INDONESIA-20-OF-2008.pdf|publisher=Commission for the Supervision of Business Competition|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| Medium || 10,000,000,000 || 50,000,000,000
|}

An annual revenue of Rp 50 billion is approximately equal to USD 3.7 million as of November 2017.

==== Bangladesh ====

In Bangladesh, Bangladesh Bank defines Small and medium enterprises based on Fixed Asset, Employed Manpower and Yearly turn over and they are definitely not Public Limited Co. and requires these characteristics -

==== Singapore ====

With effect from 1 April 2011, the definition of SMEs is businesses with annual sales turnover of not more than $100 million or employing no more than 200 staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet on New SME Definition|url=https://www.spring.gov.sg/NewsEvents/PR/Documents/Fact_Sheet_on_New_SME_Definition.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===

==== European Union ====
The criteria for defining the size of a business differ from country to country, with many countries having programs of [[business rate]] reduction and financial subsidy for SMEs. According to the [[European Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is an SME? - Small and medium sized enterprises (SME) - Enterprise and Industry |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/index_en.htm |website=ec.europa.eu |accessdate=2015-06-12 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208090338/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/index_en.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the SME are the enterprises that meet the following definition of staff headcount and either the turnover or balance sheet total definitions:

{| class="wikitable"
! Company category
! Staff headcount
! Turnover 
! Balance sheet total
|-
| Medium-sized
| &lt; 250
| ≤ €50 million
| ≤ €43 million
|-
| Small
| &lt; 50
| ≤ €10 million
| ≤ €10 million
|-
| [[Micro-enterprise|Micro]]
| &lt; 10
| ≤ €2 million
| ≤ €2 million
|}

In July 2011, the European Commission said it would open a consultation on the definition of SMEs in 2012. In Europe, there are three broad parameters which define SMEs:
* [[Micro-enterprise]]s have up to 10 employees
* Small enterprises have up to 50 employees
* Medium-sized enterprises have up to 250 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = European Commission | authorlink = European Commission | title = Recommendation 2003/361/EC: SME Definition | date = 2003-05-06 | url = http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/index_en.htm | accessdate = 2012-09-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150208090338/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/index_en.htm | archivedate = 2015-02-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The European definition of SME follows: "The category of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is made up of enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding 50 million euro, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 43 million euro."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/files/sme_definition/sme_user_guide_en.pdf Enterprise and Industry Publications: The new SME definition, user guide and model declaration], Extract of Article 2 of the Annex of Recommendation 2003/361/EC&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prepare for an evaluation and revision of some features of the small and medium-sized enterprises definition European Union established public consultation period from 6 February 2018 to 6 May 2018. Public consultation is available for all EU member country citizens and organizations. Especially, national and regional authorities, enterprises, business associations or organizations, venture capital providers, research and academic institutions, and individual citizens are expected as the main contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/consultations/public-consultation-review-sme-|title=Consultations|website=European Commission - European Commission|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EU member states have had individual definitions of what constitutes an SME. For example, the definition in [[Germany]] had a limit of 255 [[employee]]s, while in [[Belgium]] it could have been 100.  The result is that while a Belgian business of 249 employees would be taxed at full rate in Belgium, it would nevertheless be eligible for SME subsidy under a European-labelled programme.

SMEs are a crucial element in the supplier network of large enterprises which are already on their way towards [[Industry 4.0]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sommer|first1=Lutz|title=Industrial revolution - industry 4.0: Are German manufacturing SMEs the first victims of this revolution?|journal=Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management|date=28 November 2015|volume=8|issue=5|doi=10.3926/jiem.1470}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to German economist [[Hans-Heinrich Bass]], "empirical research on SME as well as policies to promote SME have a long tradition in [West] Germany, dating back into the 19th century. Until the mid-20th century most researchers considered SME as an impediment to further economic development and SME policies were thus designed in the framework of social policies. Only the [[Ordoliberalism]] school, the founding fathers of Germany's [[social market economy]], discovered their strengths, considered SME as a solution to mid-20th century economic problems (mass unemployment, abuse of economic power), and laid the foundations for non-selective (functional) industrial policies to promote SMEs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwim.uni-bremen.de/publikationen/pdf/b101.pdf Hans-Heinrich Bass: KMU in der deutschen Volkswirtschaft: Vergangenheit, Gegenwart, Zukunft, ''Berichte aus dem Weltwirtschaftlichen Colloquium der Universität Bremen'' Nr. 101, Bremen 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215101921/http://www.iwim.uni-bremen.de/publikationen/pdf/b101.pdf |date=2017-12-15 }} (PDF; 96&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Poland =====
The SME sector in Poland generates almost 50% of the GDP, and out of that, for instance, in 2011, micro companies
generated 29.6%, small companies 7.7%, and medium companies 10.4% (big companies 24.0%; other entities 16.5%,
and revenues from customs duties and taxes generated 11.9%). In 2011, out of the total of 1,784,603 entities operating in Poland, merely 3,189 were classified as "large", so 1,781,414 were micro, small, or medium.
Companies of the SMEs sector employed 6.3 million people out of the total of 9.0 million of labour employed in the
private sector. In Poland in 2011 was 36.2 SMEs per 1,000 of inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcser.org/journal/index.php/mjss/article/view/1144/1173 D. Walczak, G. Voss, New Possibilities of Supporting Polish SMEs within the Jeremie Initiative Managed by BGK, Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences, Vol 4, No 9, p. 760-761].&lt;/ref&gt;

===== United Kingdom =====
In the UK a company is defined as being an SME if it meets two out of three criteria: it has a turnover of less than £25m, it has fewer than 250 employees, it has gross assets of less than £12.5m.&lt;ref name="BIS SME definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/mid-sized-businesses|website=gov.uk|publisher=Department of Business, Innovation and Skills|title=Mid-sized businesses|accessdate=11 June 2015|ref=bis_sme_definition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many small and medium-sized businesses form part of the UK's currently growing ''[[Mittelstand]]'', or ''Brittelstand'' as it is also often named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/7bbbf9e8-1f35-11e5-ab0f-6bb9974f25d0|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are businesses in Britain that are not only small or medium but also have a much broader set of values and more elastic definition.

The [[Department for Business Innovation and Skills]] estimated that at the start of 2014, 99.3% of UK [[private sector]] businesses were SMEs, with their £1.6 trillion annual [[revenue|turnover]] accounting for 47% of private sector turnover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridging loans UK can be used for many purposes|url=http://konnectfinancial.co.uk/loan-products/bridging-loans/|website=www.konnectfinancial.co.uk|publisher=Konnect Financial|accessdate=10 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011052641/http://konnectfinancial.co.uk/loan-products/bridging-loans/|archive-date=11 October 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ukbis-"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/377934/bpe_2014_statistical_release.pdf | title=Statistical Release: Business Population Estimates for the UK and Regions 2014 | publisher=Department for Business Innovation and Skills | date=26 November 2014 | accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to support SMEs, the UK government set a target in 2010 "''that 25% of government’s spend, either directly or in supply chains, goes to SMEs by 2015''"; it achieved this by 2013.&lt;ref name="ukgov-SMEspend"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-government-buying/2010-to-2015-government-policy-government-buying#appendix-1-making-sure-government-gets-full-value-from-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises | title=2010 to 2015 government policy: government buying | date=20 February 2013 | accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Switzerland ====

In [[Switzerland]], the [[Federal Statistical Office (Switzerland)|Federal Statistical Office]] defines small and medium-sized enterprises as companies with less than 250 employees.&lt;ref name=BFS&gt;{{fr icon}} [https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/fr/home/statistiques/industrie-services/entreprises-emplois/structure-economie-entreprises/taille-forme-juridique-secteurs-repartition-regionale.html Taille, forme juridique, secteurs, répartition régionale], [[Federal Statistical Office (Switzerland)|Swiss Federal Statistical Office]] (page visited on 24 October 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The categories are the following:&lt;ref name=BFS/&gt;
* Microentreprises: 1 to 9 employees.
* Small enterprises: 10 to 49 employees.
* Medium-sized enterprises: 50 to 249  employees.
* Large enterprises: 250 employees or more.

=== North America ===

==== Canada ====
[[Industry Canada]] defines a small business as one with fewer than 100 paid employees and a medium-sized business as one with at least 100 and fewer than 500 employees.  As of December 2012, there were 1,107,540 employer businesses in Canada, of which 1,087,803 were small. Small businesses make up 98.2 percent of employer businesses, medium-sized businesses make up 1.6 percent of employer businesses and large businesses make up 0.1 percent of employer businesses. In 2012, over 7.7 million employees, or 69.7 percent of the total private labour force, worked for small businesses and 2.2 million employees, or 20.2 percent of the labour force, worked for medium-sized businesses. In total, SMEs employed about 10 million individuals, or 89.9 percent of employees. Canadian high-growth firms are present in every economic sector and are not just concentrated in knowledge-based industries. In terms of employment, the highest concentrations of high-growth firms in Canada during the 2006–2009 period were in construction (4.9 percent of all firms); business, building and other support services (4.6 percent); and professional, scientific and technical services (4.5 percent). In 2011, only 10.4 percent of SMEs exported. Nonetheless, they were responsible for $150 billion, or about 41.0 percent, of Canada's total value of exports.&lt;ref name="CAstats-Aug13"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/061.nsf/eng/h_02800.html | title=Key Small Business Statistics - August 2013 | publisher=Industry Canada | work=ic.gc.ca | date=2013-09-13 | accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations in Canada are generally taxed at 29% federally.  Canadian Controlled private corporations receive a 17% reduction in the tax rate on taxable income from active businesses up to $500,000.  This small business deduction is reduced for corporations whose taxable capital exceeding $10M, and is completely eliminated for corporations whose taxable capital exceeds $15M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=T2 Corporation - Income Tax Guide - Chapter 4: Page 4 of the T2 return|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/t4012/t4012-06-e.html|publisher=Canada Revenue Agency|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been estimated that almost $2 trillion of Canadian SMEs will be coming up for sale over the next decade which is twice as large as the assets of the top 1,000 Canadian pension plans and approximately the same size as Canadian annual GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equicapita.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Equicapita_May_050214.pdf|title=Equicapita May 2014 - Who Will Buy Baby Boomer Businesses?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mexico ====
The small and medium-sized companies in Mexico are called [[Small and medium enterprises in Mexico|PYMEs]], which is a direct translation of SMEs. But there's another categorization in the country called MiPyMEs. The MiPyMEs are micro, small and medium-sized businesses, with an emphasis on micro which are one man companies or a type of freelance.

==== United States ====
In the [[United States]], the [[Small Business Administration]] sets [[small business]] criteria based on industry, ownership structure, revenue and number of employees (which in some circumstances may be as high as 1500, although the cap is typically 500).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Small Business Administration|title=Size Standards|accessdate=2011-08-21|url=http://www.sba.gov/category/navigation-structure/contracting/contracting-officials/size-standards}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both the US and the EU generally use the same threshold of fewer than 10 employees for [[small office]]s (SOHO).{{Citation needed|reason=A citation is needed for the claim that the European Union and Small Business Administration have a size-standard classification for the term small office or SOHO|date=February 2014}}

Also in the [[United States]], small and medium-sized manufacturers are referred to as SMMs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy|title=Targeting Small and Medium-Sized Manufacturers|accessdate=2017-04-03|url=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/mep/data/ACEE.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the US Department of Energy classifies as having gross annual sales below $100 million, fewer than 500 employees at the plant site, and annual energy bills more than $100,000 but less than $2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Industrial Assessment Center Small-Mid Size Manufacturer Criteria|title=Industrial Assessment Centers|accessdate=2017-04-03|url=https://energy.gov/eere/amo/industrial-assessment-centers-iacs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4267">'''TREX''' is a search engine in the [[NetWeaver|SAP NetWeaver]] integrated technology platform produced by [[SAP SE]] using [[columnar storage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://db.csail.mit.edu/pubs/abadi-column-stores.pdf|doi=10.1561/1900000024|title=The Design and Implementation of Modern Column-Oriented Database Systems|author1=Daniel Abadi|author2=Peter Boncz|author3=Stavros Harizopoulos|author4=Stratos Idreos|author5=Samuel Madden|journal=Foundations and Trends in Databases|volume=5|issue=3|year=2012|pages=197–280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TREX engine is a standalone component that can be used in a range of system environments but is used primarily as an integral part of SAP products such as Enterprise Portal, Knowledge Warehouse, and '''Business Intelligence (BI, formerly [[SAP Business Information Warehouse]]).''' In SAP NetWeaver BI, the TREX engine powers the BI Accelerator, which is a plug-in appliance for enhancing the performance of [[online analytical processing]]. The name "TREX" stands for '''Text Retrieval and information EXtraction''', but it is not a registered trademark of SAP and is not used in marketing collateral.

==Search functions==

TREX supports various kinds of text search, including exact search, boolean search, wildcard search, linguistic search (grammatical variants are normalized for the index search) and fuzzy search (input strings that differ by a few letters from an index term are normalized for the index search). Result sets are ranked using term frequency-inverse document frequency ([[tf-idf]]) weighting, and results can include snippets with the search terms highlighted.

TREX supports text mining and classification using a [[vector space model]]. Groups of documents can be classified using query based classification, example based classification, or a combination of these plus keyword management.

TREX supports structured data search not only for document metadata but also for mass business data and data in SAP [[Business Objects]]. Indexes for structured data are implemented compactly using [[data compression]] and the data can be aggregated in linear time, to enable large volumes of data to be processed entirely in memory.

Recent developments include:
* A join engine to join structured data from different fields in business objects
* A fast update capability to write a delta index beside a main index and to merge them offline while a second delta index takes updates
* A [[data mining]] feature pack for advanced mathematical analysis

==History==

The first code for the engine was written in 1998 and TREX became an SAP component in 2000. The SAP NetWeaver BI Accelerator was first rolled out in 2005. As of Q1 2013, the current release of TREX is SAP NW 7.1.

== Security ==
A security vulnerability in TREX was first identified and fixed in 2015 (see SAP Security Note [https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2234226 2234226])[https://www.scmagazineuk.com/bugs-in-sap-hana-allowed-remote-code-execution/article/530856/]. The vulnerability occurred due to lack of authentication in TREXnet, an internal communication protocol. The aforementioned patch fixed the problem by removing some critical functionality.

Later on, ERPScan head of threat intelligence Mathieu Geli continued to look into the vulnerability and found that the vulnerability was still exploitable [https://erpscan.com/press-center/press-release/critical-vulnerability-affects-sap-hana-dozen-sap-applications/]. Moreover, in case of successful attack, the vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to get full control over the server without authorization [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/13/sap_trex_patch/]. The vulnerability has been finally patched via SAP Security Note 2419592.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5532">[[File:VanWestendorp1.svg|thumb|Price Sensitivity Meter (van Westendorp)]]
The '''Price Sensitivity Meter (PSM)''' is a market technique for determining [[consumer]] price preferences. It was introduced in 1976 by Dutch economist [[Peter van Westendorp]]. The technique has been used by a wide variety of researchers in the [[market research]] industry. The PSM approach has been a staple technique for addressing pricing issues for the past 20 years. It historically has been promoted by many professional market research associations in their training and professional development programs. The PSM approach continues to be used widely throughout the market research industry and descriptions can be easily found in many market research websites.

==Assumptions==
The assumption underlying PSM is that respondents are capable of envisioning a pricing landscape and that price is an intrinsic measure of value or [[utility]]. Participants in a PSM exercise are asked to identify price points at which they can infer a particular value to the product or service under study. PSM claims to capture the extent to which a product has an inherent value denoted by price.

==Approach==
[[File:Van Westendorp survey example.png|thumb|right|Example Van Westendorp questionnaire performed on [https://run.conjoint.ly/study/4462/y483s002fm Conjoint.ly].]]
The traditional PSM approach asks four price-related questions, which are then evaluated as a series of four cumulative distributions, one distribution for each question. The standard question formats can vary, but generally take the following form:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

* At what price would you consider the product to be so expensive that you would not consider buying it? (Too expensive)
* At what price would you consider the product to be priced so low that you would feel the quality couldn’t be very good? (Too cheap)
* At what price would you consider the product starting to get expensive, so that it is not out of the question, but you would have to give some thought to buying it? (Expensive/High Side)
* At what price would you consider the product to be a bargain—a great buy for the money? (Cheap/Good Value)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cumulative frequencies are plotted, and PSM advocates claim interpretive qualities exist for any intersecting of the cumulative frequencies for each of the four price categories. Note that the standard method requires that two of the four cumulative frequencies must be inverted in order to have the possibility of four intersecting points. Conventional practice inverts the cumulative frequencies for "too cheap" and "cheap".

The general explanation of intersecting cumulative frequencies varies. A common description of the intersections is that the crossing of "too cheap" and "expensive" can be the lower bound of an acceptable price range. Some describe this as the "point of marginal cheapness" or PMC. Similarly, the intersection of the "too expensive" and "cheap" lines can be viewed as the upper bound of an acceptable price range. An alternative description is the "point of marginal expensiveness" or PME.

Intersections where there is generally more agreement is the point at which the "expensive" line crosses the "cheap" line. This is described as the "indifference price point" or IPP. The IPP refers to the price at which an equal number of respondents rate the price point as either "cheap" or "expensive".

Finally, the intersection of the "too cheap" and "too expensive" lines represents an "optimal price point" or OPP. This is the point at which an equal number of respondents describe the price as exceeding either their upper or lower limits. Optimal in this sense refers to the fact that there is an equal tradeoff in extreme sensitivities to the price at both ends of the price spectrum.

While Van Westendorp himself did not attempt to solve the demand estimation problem (only pricing) three important extensions to the technique Newton/Miller/Smith (NMS), Martin Rayner Interpolation (MRI) and Roll/Achterberg (RA) were subsequently developed to address this problem and estimate demand.

'''WGBN''' (AM 1360) is a [[gospel music|gospel]] [[radio station]] that serves the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] market. Owned by Pentecostal Temple Development Corporation, the station operates at 1360&amp;nbsp;[[Kilohertz|kHz]] with a power of 5,000 watts daytime, 1,000 watts nighttime, and is licensed to [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania]].

==History==

===As WMCK===
The station began broadcasting April 30, 1947, with the call letters WMCK, and under the ownership of the Mon-Yough Broadcasting Company.  George Raikes served as company president, and Jack Craddock as general manager.  Studios were located at 517 Market Street in McKeesport.  Its initial programming included Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WMCK on Air|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1947/1947-05-12-BC.pdf|accessdate=27 September 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=May 12, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these early years, the station broadcast at a full-time power of 1,000 watts, day and night, changing to a directional antenna pattern during the nighttime hours.

===As WIXZ===

It was a [[Top 40]] station with the [[call letters]] ''WIXZ'' ("Wick-zee 1360") beginning in 1969, following its acquisition by WWZ Corporation and the move of its studios and offices to the recently completed [[Monroeville Mall]]. Among its disc jockeys during the Top 40 era was Jeff Christie, better known today by his real name, [[Rush Limbaugh]].

On June 19, 1974, the station was sold to Renda Broadcasting Corporation.  Anthony F. Renda served as the company president and Melvin Abramovitz was appointed as station manager.  By the end of the decade, the station changed its format to country and the studios and offices were moved to 400 Lincoln Highway in East McKeesport.

On July 16, 1985, Renda Broadcasting Corporation sold WIXZ to Serena Communications, a company owned by Renda executive Alan C. Serena.  Renda had acquired Pittsburgh stations [[WJAS]] and [[WSHH]] the year before and was required to sell off WIXZ to comply with more stringent FCC ownership requirements at the time that limited owners to possess no more than one AM and one FM property in any given market.  Serena maintained the format until September 1997, when Renda Broadcasting bought back the station after FCC ownership rules were relaxed.

===As WPTT and WMNY===

Shortly after the re-acquisition, WIXZ switched to a [[Talk radio|talk]] format, then took the WPTT call letters (formerly on [[WPNT|channel 22]] in Pittsburgh).  On August 19, 2008, [[Renda Broadcasting]] announced that WPTT would be switching formats from talk to financial advice;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Roth, "[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08232/905263-42.stm Format change will take Cullen off WPTT]," ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' (August 19, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; this was accompanied by a call change to WMNY.  In all of its incarnations since WMCK, the radio station has positioned itself as a Pittsburgh outlet, rather than directly addressing the suburb of McKeesport, despite a weak nighttime signal.

On September 19, 2011, Renda Broadcasting announced that WMNY would return to its "AM News Talk 1360" format.  This format contains numerous popular talk programs from the Talk Radio Network based radio network.

===As WGBN===

In July 2013, Renda Broadcasting announced that WMNY would be donated to Pentecostal Temple Development Corporation, licensee of [[WMNY|WGBN]] in New Kensington.  The transaction was completed on October 9, 2013. 1360 went off the air for about a month to allow engineering adjustments that would allow it to simulcast 1150's programming. The stations swapped call signs on March 1, 2014.

[[File:The Cathedral of St Giles, Edinburgh - geograph.org.uk - 505970.jpg|300px|thumb| Walter Chepman was a patron of The High Kirk of Edinburgh, also known as Saint Giles' Cathedral.]]

'''Walter Chepman''' was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[merchant]], [[Notary public|notary]] and civil servant active in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Chepman served at the Scottish [[Court (royal)|court]] during the reigns of [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] and [[James V of Scotland|James V]]. 
In partnership with [[Androw Myllar]] he established [[Chepman and Myllar Press|Scotland's first printing press]] in 1508.&lt;ref name="C and M prints"&gt;[http://digital.nls.uk/firstscottishbooks/index.html The Chepman and Myllar Prints at the National Library of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NLS Breviary"&gt;[http://digital.nls.uk/74487406 The Aberdeen Breviary at the National Library of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; Chepman was also a significant patron of [[St Giles' Cathedral|Saint Giles' Kirk]] in [[Edinburgh]].

==Biography==
[[File:Memorial to Walter Chepman.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Walter Chepman in [[St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh|St. Giles' Cathedral]] erected in 1879 by William Chambers LLD.]]
Chepman's first appearance in the historical record is in the accounts of the [[Lord High Treasurer of Scotland]] for 1494 in which he is recorded as receiving payment for clerical work at the royal court.&lt;ref name="ALHTS"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/accountsoflordhi03scot Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol.3 (1901), see index, p.470]&lt;/ref&gt; He would continue to receive such payments for the remainder of his life.

The impression that Chepman was well-educated is supported by the fact that he acted as a notary in and around Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Chepman, Walter|volume=10|pages=186-187|first=Aeneas James George |last=Mackay}}&lt;/ref&gt; His service at court also suggests that he was trusted by King James IV. In 1503, to coincide with the King's marriage, James presented Chepman with a suit of clothes of English fabric.&lt;ref name="ALHTS"/&gt;

Walter Chepman traded in imported textiles and timber and regularly supplied goods to the King.&lt;ref name="ALHTS"/&gt;
He appears to have been a prosperous man. He owned [[tenement]]s in Edinburgh's Blackfriars Wynd&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; and, at the southern end of this wynd where it joined the Southgait, he and Androw Myllar would establish their press.

Chepman was married twice. His first wife was Margaret Kerkettle and, after being widowed, he married Agnes Cockburn.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Chepman died at an unknown point after 1528 and was buried in the chapel he had established at the Kirk of Saint Giles in Edinburgh, now known as the Chepman Aisle.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==The Southgait Press==
[[File:Goldyn Targe.gif|upright|thumb|Walter Chepman's device in his print of The Goldyn Targe.]]
In September 1507 King James IV authorised Walter Chepman and Androw Myllar to establish a printing press and awarded the two partners a monopoly in printed books within Scotland.&lt;ref name="Privy Seal"&gt;The Register Of the Privy Seal of Scotland, 15 September 1507. Scottish National Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Androw Myllar was also a burgess of Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="Privy Seal"/&gt; He was a bookseller who had previously published books, printed in Rouen, intended for sale in England.

Chepman and Myllar's press was functional by the following Spring and was based in the [[Cowgate|Southgait]] of Edinburgh. Its works included a liturgical text known as [[Aberdeen Breviary|The Aberdeen Breviary]]&lt;ref name="NLS Breviary"/&gt; and 'The Chepman and Myllar Prints'&lt;ref name="C and M prints"/&gt; which were a series of pamphlets containing popular literature in [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[English language|English]].

The press did not have a long working life. The latest surviving example of its work is an edition of the Aberdeen Breviary dating to 1510.&lt;ref name="Dawson"&gt;Jane E. A. Dawson, ''Scotland Re-formed'', The New Edinburgh History of Scotland, Volume 6. Edinburgh University Press, 2007, p.81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious Patronage==

Walter Chepman paid for the foundation of two chapels at the Kirk of Saint Giles in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

The first chapel, founded in 1513 and abutting to the south of the church, offered [[Office of the Dead|masses for the souls]] of Chepman, his first wife and of the King and [[Margaret Tudor|Queen]]. The equivalent part of the modern church is now known as 'The Chepman Aisle'. It contains the seventeenth century tomb of [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|The Marquess of Montrose]] and a memorial plaque in honour of Walter Chepman donated by the nineteenth century publisher [[William Chambers (publisher)|William Chambers]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1528 Chepman established a mortuary chapel, now lost, in the cemetery of Saint Giles' Kirk. It was dedicated to the performance of masses in honour of Chepman, both his wives, King James V, King James IV and all the Scots who had died at [[Battle of Flodden|Flodden]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Willy Naessens''' is a well known industrialist in [[Belgium]]. Born around [[World War II]] in [[Wortegem-Petegem]] (between [[Oudenaarde]] and [[Ghent]]), [[East Flanders]], Naessens grew up in a modest family.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

At young age, he started a construction business called "Naessens Constructions", specializing in constructing big - but rather economised - industrial buildings and swimming pools. He became one of the most powerful Belgian industrialists. Nowadays, his corporate group participates in many branches of the construction sector, and in non-construction businesses, such as restaurants and sports-teams.
Nevertheless, he always gave a share to charity. For instance, he became very popular by paying a very expensive organ transplantation for a Belgian child. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
