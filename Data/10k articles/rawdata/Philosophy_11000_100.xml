'''Akrodha''' ([[Sanskrit]]: अक्रोध) literally means "free from anger".&lt;ref name=apte/&gt; It is considered an important virtue in Indian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Mohapatra (1993), Hinduism: Analytical Study, South Asian Books, {{ISBN|978-81-7099-388-9}}, page 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Akrodha is a fusion word ''a'' (अ, without, non) and ''krodha'' (क्रोध, anger),&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=krodha&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 krodha] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; or 'without anger'. A related word is ''Akrodhah'' ([[Sanskrit]]: अक्रोध:), which also means 'absence of anger'.&lt;ref name=apte&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%A7&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
''Akrodha'' is considered a virtue and desirable ethical value in Hinduism. When there is cause of getting angry but even then there is absence of anger, it is non-anger or ''akrodha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Integrated Development Plan for India|author=Shanti Swarup Gupta|publisher=Concept Publishing|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UY7vr_CF_WcC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=Akrodha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgsEU67JJuSS7AaPwIG4Bw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Akrodha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absence of anger (''akrodha'') means being calm even when insulted, rebuked or despite great provocation. ''Akrodha'' does not mean absence of causes of anger, it means not getting angry and keeping an even, calm temper despite the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita|author=Dharmdeo Singh|publisher=Llumina Press|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eixNr74-MggC&amp;pg=PT69&amp;dq=Akrodha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgsEU67JJuSS7AaPwIG4Bw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Akrodha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Krodha'' ('anger') is excessive mental turmoil on account of the obstacles in the gratification of some desire; it is manifestation of the quality of [[Tamas (philosophy)|tamas]] (dark, negative, destructive), an undesirable psychological state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shrimad Bhagavad Gita|author=Pushpa Anand|publisher=Arpana publications|pages=874–875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rl8pAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Akrodha&amp;dq=Akrodha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgsEU67JJuSS7AaPwIG4Bw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of ''Krodha'' is ''Akrodha'', and this is a productive, positive and constructive state.

Bhawuk states that ''akrodha'' is necessary to any process of peace. Peace and happiness is a state of contentment (santustah), where there is absence of spite or envy (advestah), absence of anger (akrodhah), and absence of violence ([[ahimsa]]).&lt;ref&gt;DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology, Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, page 138&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dharma]]'' relies on ''Akrodha'', because it creates an environment of serenity, a rational principle of life, and because it is a moral virtue inspired by love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism: Analytical Study|author=Amulya Mohapatra|publisher=Mittal Publications|pages=40–41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpiU9m7T_tQC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=Akrodha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgsEU67JJuSS7AaPwIG4Bw&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Akrodha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
According to [[Vedic]] sages, when work becomes akin to a ''[[yajna]]'' (a worship ceremony), the effect of that work is transformed into ''[[apurva]]'', that is, it becomes something unique, unprecedented and empowering. In contrast, anger clouds reason, which results in the loss of discrimination between right and wrong and virtue and vice. When the discriminating faculty is ruined, the person loses self-identity and the inner good perishes. With freedom from anger, a person reaches an ''apurva'' state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hindu Mind|author=Bansi Pandit|publisher=New Age Books|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XA9zEw93KXEC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=Akrodha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0Q0EU5LQEsiN7QbkmoGoBQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Akrodha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Upanishads===
Narada Parivrajaka Upanishad states the nature of ''akrodha'' for a person who seeks self-knowledge and liberation ([[moksha|kaivalya]]) as follows,

{{quote|All cruel words should be endured. None should be treated with disrespect. No anger should be directed in turn towards one who is angry. Only soft words should be spoken, even when violently pulled by another.|[[Narada Parivrajaka Upanishad]], Atharva Veda|&lt;ref&gt;KN Aiyar (Translator), Thirty Minor Upanishads, Madras (1914), page 138–140, {{oclc|23013613}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Akrodha'', states Manickam,&lt;ref name=lssm&gt;L. Sam S. Manickam, [http://www.indigenouspsych.org/Interest%20Group/Manickam/Y-5f-Sam.pdf Sahya: The Concept in Indian Philosophical Psychology and Its Contemporary Relevance], in Yoga and Indian Approaches to Psychology, (Editors: Joshi, Cornelissen et al.) Centre for the Study of Civilizations, pages 426–435, {{oclc|466687885}}&lt;/ref&gt; is related to the concept ''Sahya'' (Sanskrit: सह्य) in the Upanishads. ''Sahya'' means, depending on the context, to bear, endure, suffer, and put up with.&lt;ref name=lssm/&gt; The quality to ''Sahya'' is considered an ethical value in Hinduism, not out of weakness to react, but for the cause of the ultimate "Truth". It is the attribute by which a person willingly bears negative cognitive inputs in order to "win over" the opponent or whatever is offensive, in the pursuit of holding on to Truth, in order to achieve oneness with Brahman, the ultimate Truth. This endurance, this strive to overcome the adversaries, through ''akrodha'' and ''[[ahimsa]]'', is recommended as the constructive way in one's pursuit of "Truth".&lt;ref name=lssm/&gt;

===The Epics===
The Hindu epic Mahabharata repeatedly emphasizes the virtue of ''akrodha''. For example, in [[Adi Parva]], it states&lt;ref name=mndap/&gt;

{{quote|If wronged, you should not wrong in return. One's anger, if not subdued, burns one's own self; if subdued, it procures the virtues of the doers of good acts. You should never give pain to others by cruel words. Never defeat your enemies by despicable means. Never utter sinful and burning words as may give pain to others.|The [[Mahabharata]], Adi Parva, Chapter LXXXVII, verses 7–8|&lt;ref name=mndap&gt;MN Dutt (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/aproseenglishtr00duttgoog#page/n139/mode/2up Adi Parva], Chapter LXXXVII, Page 129&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Vana Parva]], the Mahabharata states&lt;ref name=mndap2/&gt;

{{quote|Anger is in this world, the root of the destruction of mankind. The angry man commits a sin; the angry man murders his preceptor; the angry man insults with harsh words. The angry man cannot distinguish what should be and should not be said by him; there is nothing which cannot be said or done by an angry man. From anger, a man may kill one who should not be killed and adore one that should be slain; an angry man may even despatch his own self to the abode of [[Yama]]. Beholding these evils, anger must be conquered.|The [[Mahabharata]], Vana Parva, Chapter XXIX, verses 3–7|&lt;ref name=mndap2&gt;MN Dutt (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/aproseenglishtr00duttgoog#page/n487/mode/2up Vana Parva], Chapter LXXXVII, Page 129&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Shanti Parva]], the Mahabharata states&lt;ref name=mndap3/&gt;

{{quote|That [[Yogin]] who is freed from attachment and pride, who transcends all pairs of opposites such as pleasure and pain, who never gives way to '''wrath''' or hate, who never speaks an untruth, who though slandered or struck still shows friendship for the slanderer or the striker, who never thinks of doing ill to others, who restrains these three, viz. speech, acts and mind, and who behaves uniformly towards all creatures, succeeds in approaching [[Brahman]] (true self).|The [[Mahabharata]], Shanti Parva, Chapter CCXXXVI|&lt;ref name=mndap3&gt;MN Dutt (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri07royp#page/260/mode/2up Shanti Parva], Chapter CCXXXVI, Page 260&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] (Slokas XVI.1–3), in the Mahabharata, gives a list of twenty-six divine attributes beginning with ''abhayam'' ('fearlessness') and ''sattva sansuddhih'' ('purity of mind'), ending with ''adroha'' ('bearing enmity to none') and ''naatimaanita'' ('absence of arrogance'):&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=nAtimAnin&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes नातिमानिन्] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

:अभयं सत्त्वसंशुध्दिर्ज्ञानयोगव्यवस्थितिः|

:अहिंसा '''सत्यमक्रोधस्त्यागः''' शान्तिरपैशुनम् |

''Akrodha'' is one of the twenty six divine attributes a person can have, states Bhagavad Gita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadgita Tattvavivecani|author=Jayadayal Goyandaka|publisher=Gita Press, Gorakhpur|pages=621–623|quote=Quote: Non-violence in thought, word and deed, truthfulness and geniality of speech, '''absence of anger even on provocation''', disclaiming doership in respect of actions, quietude or composure of mind, abstaining from malicious gossip compassion towards all creatures, absence of attachment to the objects of senses even during their contact with the senses, mildness, a sense of shame in transgressing against the scriptures or usage, and abstaining from frivolous pursuits; (XVI.2)|url= https://www.amazon.ca/Srimadbhagavadgita-Tattvavivecani-With-English-Commentary/dp/B003FCYKVU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharmasastra===
[[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] has listed ''Akrodha'' ('absence of anger') among the ten primary virtues. The ''Apastambhadharmasutra'' (I.iii.22) rules that a student be not given to anger,  and that a house-holder is required to abstain from anger and abstain from action or words that would provoke someone else to anger (II.xviii.2). The ''Baudhayanadharmasutra'' (I.xv.30) requires a house-holder never to be angry, and the ''Gautamdharmasutra'' (II.13) advises that he must not feel angry. The ''Vashisthadharmasutra'' (IV.4) avers that refraining from anger is a virtue like truthfulness, charity among others.&lt;ref name=rp&gt;{{cite book|title=A Conceptual-analytic Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals|author=Rajendra Prasad|publisher=Concept Publishing|page=319|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D5Hk8EkmQBcC&amp;pg=PA319&amp;dq=Akrodha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgsEU67JJuSS7AaPwIG4Bw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Akrodha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manu mentions ten ''Dharma Lakshanas'', ''akrodha'' is one of these ''[[lakshana]]'' (attribute, sign of a dharmic person). The other nine are: Dhriti (patience), Kshama (forgiveness), Damah (temperance), Asteya (non-stealing), Shaucham (purity), Indriyaigraha (freedom from sensual craving), Dhi (reason), Vidya (knowledge), and Satyam (truth).&lt;ref&gt;Karanam Nagaraja Rao and Krishna Kishore, Electronic Journal of Business Ethics and Organization Studies, Vol. 19, No. 2 (2014), pages 4–8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shaivism===
The [[Shaivite]] doctrine considers four ''[[yamas]]'' for the ''[[Pashupata Shaivism|Pashupata]]'' ascetic who smears on his body ''bhasam''; the four ''yamas'' are – non-injury, celibacy, truthfulness and non-stealing; the ''[[niyama]]s'' consist of non-irritability (''akrodha''), attendance on the teachers, purity, lightness of diet and carefulness (''[[apramada]]''). ''Akrodha'' is a virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Philosophy Vol.5|author=Surendranath Dasgupta |publisher= Motilal Banarsidass |page=134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aohGsuUuXuMC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=Akrodha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgsEU67JJuSS7AaPwIG4Bw&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Akrodha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universalism==
[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] both suggest ten freedoms needed for good life.&lt;ref name=ms/&gt; These are – ''[[Ahimsa]]'' ('freedom from violence'), ''[[Asteya]]'' ('freedom from want, stealing'), ''[[Aparigraha]]'' ('freedom from exploitation'), ''Amritava'' ('freedom from early death') and ''Arogya'' ('freedom from disease'), ''Akrodha'' ('freedom of anger'), ''[[Jnana]]'' or ''Vidya'' ("freedom from ignorance"), ''Pravrtti'' ("freedom of conscience"), ''Abhaya'' ('freedom from fear') and ''[[Dhrti]]'' ('freedom from frustration and despair').&lt;ref name=ms&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Human Rights|author=[[Micheline Ishay]]|publisher=University of California Press|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTh22XQrtlQC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Akrodha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5gwEU8eGHMG47AbmzoH4Cw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Akrodha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked as a full professor of philosophy at Graz from 1878, then at [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] (from 1882 as a replacement for [[Wilhelm Windelband]]),&lt;ref name=DB/&gt; [[University of Kiel|Kiel]] and [[University of Halle|Halle]], and finally at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], where he commissioned [[Mies van der Rohe]] to design his house in Neu[[babelsberg]].

For Riehl, philosophy was not the teaching of ''[[Weltanschauung]]'', but principally a criticism of perception.

He was the doctoral advisor of [[Paul Hensel]].

Riehl died in Neubabelsberg, near [[Potsdam]],&lt;ref name=DB&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz105830.html Riehl, Alois (Aloys)] at Deutsche Biographie&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried in the Alter Friedhof in [[Klein-Glienicke]].

His wife Sofie, was the aunt of Frieda Gross, the wife of the [[Austria]]n [[medical doctor]], [[scientist]] and [[revolutionary]], [[Otto Gross]].

'''Antoine Louis Claude Destutt, comte de Tracy''' ({{IPA-fr|dəsty də tʁasi|lang}}; 20 July 1754{{snd}}9 March 1836) was a [[France|French]] [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] and [[philosopher]] who coined the term "[[ideology]]".

==Biography==
The son of a distinguished soldier, Claude Destutt, he was born in [[Paris]]. His family was of Scottish descent, tracing its origin to Walter Stutt, who in 1420 had accompanied the Earls of Buchan and Douglas to the court of France, and whose family afterwards rose to be counts of Tracy. He was educated at home and at the [[University of Strasbourg]], where he was noted for his athletic skill. He went into the army, and when the [[French Revolution]] broke out, he took an active part in the provincial assembly of Bourbonnais. Elected a deputy of the nobility to the states-general, he sat alongside his friend, the [[Marquis de La Fayette]]. In the spring of 1792, he received the rank of ''maréchal de camp'' in command of the cavalry in the army of the north; but the influence of the extremists becoming predominant he took indefinite leave of absence, and settled at [[Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy|Auteuil]], where, with [[Marquis de Condorcet|Condorcet]] and [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis|Cabanis]], he devoted himself to scientific studies.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Tracy, Antoine Louis Claude Destutt, Comte de |volume=27 |pages=126–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Reign of Terror]], he was arrested and imprisoned for nearly a year, during which he studied [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]] and [[John Locke|Locke]], and abandoned the natural sciences for philosophy.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1795, he was named associate of the [[Institut de France]];&lt;ref name="Byrnes2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph F. Byrnes|title=Catholic and French Forever: Religious and National Identity in Modern France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ayrAG5YjUEC&amp;pg=PA83|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04779-8|pages=83–}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was the year when the ''Institut'' was established. On the motion of Cabanis, he was named in the class of the moral and political sciences. He soon began to attract attention by the memoires which he read before his colleagues—papers which formed the first draft of his comprehensive work on [[ideology]], named ''Eléments d'idéologie''. He conceived of ideology as the "science of ideas."  The society of "ideologists" at Auteuil embraced, besides Cabanis and Tracy, [[Constantin-François de Chassebœuf, Comte de Volney]] and [[Dominique Joseph Garat]], professor in the National Institute.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Along with some of these colleagues, he was a member of the cultural society ''[[Les Neuf Sœurs]]''.

Under the [[First French Empire|Empire]], Tracy was a member of the senate, but took little part in its deliberations. Under the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Restoration]] he became a [[peer of France]], but protested against the reactionary split of the government, and remained in opposition. In 1808, he was elected a member of the [[Académie française]] in place of Cabanis, and in 1832, he was also named a member of the Academy of Moral Sciences on its reorganization. He appeared, however, only once at its conferences, owing to his age and to disappointment at the comparative failure of his work. Destutt de Tracy was one of the principal advocates of [[liberalism]] during and after the Revolution. He died in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Philosophy==
[[File:David d'Angers - Destutt de Tracy.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Destutt de Tracy by [[David d'Angers]] (1837).]]

Destutt de Tracy was the last eminent representative of the sensualistic school which Condillac founded in France upon a one-sided interpretation of Locke. In full agreement with the materialist views of Cabanis, de Tracy pushed the sensualist principles of Condillac to their most necessary consequences. While the attention of Cabanis was devoted mostly to the physiological side of man, Tracy's interests concerned the then newly determined "ideological," in contrast to "psychological," sides of humanity. His grounding notion of ideology, he frankly stated, fell as "a part of zoology" (biology). The four faculties into which de Tracy divides the conscious life—perception, memory, judgment, volition—are all varieties of sensation. Perception is sensation caused by a present affection of the external extremities of the nerves; memory is sensation caused, in the absence of present excitation, by dispositions of the nerves which are the result of past experiences; judgment is the perception of relations between sensations, and is itself a species of sensation, because if we are aware of the sensations we must be aware also of the relations between them; and volition he identifies with the feeling of desire, and is therefore included as a type of sensation.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Considered for the influences of his philosophy, de Tracy minimally deserves credit for his distinction between active and passive touch, which ultimately fed the development of psychological theories of muscular sense. His account of the notion of external existence, as it derived not from pure sensation, but from the experience of action on the one hand and resistance on the other, stands in this light to be compared with the works of [[Alexander Bain]] and later psychologists.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

His chief works are the five-volume ''Eléments d'idéologie'' (1817–1818), the first volume of which was presented as "Ideology Strictly Defined," and which completed the arguments made in earlier completed monographs; ''Commentaire sur l'esprit des lois de Montesquieu'' (1806), and ''Essai sur le génie, et les ouvrages de Montesquieu'' (1808).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The fourth volume of the ''Eléments d'idéologie'' the author regarded as the introduction to a ''second'' section of the planned nine-part work,&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, Antoine Louis Claude Destutt de, ''[http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=121&amp;chapter=37845&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 A Treatise on Political Economy]'', trans. edited by Thomas Jefferson (Georgetown: Joseph Milligan, 1817; reprinted New York: Augustus M.

==Legacy==
Tracy advanced a rigorous use of deductive method in social theory, seeing economics in terms of actions ([[praxeology]]) and exchanges ([[catallactics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klein |first=Daniel |title=Deductive economic methodology in the French Enlightenment: Condillac and Destutt de Tracy |journal=[[History of Political Economy]] |year=1985 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=51–71 |doi=10.1215/00182702-17-1-51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy's influence can be seen both on the Continent, particularly on [[Stendhal]], [[Augustin Thierry]], [[Auguste Comte]], and [[Charles Dunoyer]], and in America, where the general approach of the [[French Liberal School]] of political economy competed evenly with British [[Classical economics|classical political economy]] well until the end of the 19th century, as evidence in the work and reputation of [[Arthur Latham Perry]] and others. In his political writings,&lt;ref&gt;de Tracy, Antoine Louis Claude Destutt, ''A Commentary and Review of Montesquieu's Spirit of Laws'', trans. Thomas Jefferson (1811) (New York: Burt Franklin, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy rejected monarchism, favoring the American republican form of government. This republicanism, as well as his advocacy of reason in philosophy and [[laissez-faire]] for economic policy, lost him favor with [[Napoleon]], who turned Tracy's coinage of "ideology" into a term of abuse; [[Karl Marx]] followed this vein of invective to refer to Tracy as a "fischblütige Bourgeoisdoktrinär"—a "fish-blooded bourgeois doctrinaire."

Thomas Jefferson, on the other hand, thought highly enough of Destutt de Tracy's work to ready two of his manuscripts for American publication. In his preface to the 1817 publication, Jefferson wrote, "By diffusing sound principles of Political Economy, it will protect the public industry from the parasite institutions now consuming it. . . ."&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Willisam F. "[http://www.phillysoc.org/campwilm.htm Liberty, Peace, and Self-Interest Properly Understood] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908093412/http://www.phillysoc.org/campwilm.htm |date=September 8, 2008 }}", speech before The Philadelphia Society, Regional Meeting, Wilmington, Delaware, October 10, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy's criticism of [[Montesquieu]] and his endorsement of representative democracy were influential on Jefferson's thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dahl|first1=Robert|title=On Democracy|date=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stendhal]] was much influenced by de Tracy's enlightenment ideals, and attended the de Tracy salon regularly, in the 1820s, as he described in ''[[Memoirs of an Egotist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Josephison, ''Stendhal'', p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; Destutt de Tracy was important to the liberals of the 1820s; Richard Stites writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Franco Venturi noted that the ''Commentary'' "resounded throughout the whole period of the liberal revolutions, from the Spain of 1820 to the Russia of 1825." An American historian wrote that "the Russian Decembrists, along with numerous other liberals, ''Carbonari'', and revolutionaries of the 1820s used this ''Commentary'' as their political Bible." The Decembrist Mikhail Orlov recalled that his circle considered it "the epitome of wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Stites, ''The Four Horsemen: Riding to Liberty in Post-Napoleonic Europe'' (Oxford University Press, 2014; {{ISBN|0199978085}}), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theory was first described by [[William Bateson]] in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bateson|first=William|title=Heredity and variation in modern lights|journal=Darwin and Modern Science|year=1909|pages=85–101|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511693953.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; then independently described by [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dobzhansky |first=Theodosius |title=Studies on Hybrid Sterility.

The model states that genetic incompatibility is most likely evolved by alternative fixation of two or more loci instead of just one, so that when hybridization occurs, it is the first time for some of the alleles to co-occur in the same individual. For example, imagine two populations that only recently separated geographically. Both sides are starting with the same genotype ''AABB''. One population can then evolve to ''aaBB'', through the transition state ''AaBB'', while the other evolves to ''AAbb'', through the transition state ''AABb''. During these processes, ''a'' allele will co-occur with ''A'' and ''B'' alleles, and ''b'' will co-occur with ''A'' and ''B'' alleles, without fitness consequences. When hybridization occurs, it is the first time ''a'' and ''b'' alleles co-occur, and they are the alleles that are incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution|author=[[Douglas J.

'''Buddha-nature''' or '''Buddha Principle''' refers to several related terms,{{refn|group=note|Buddha-dhatu, mind, tathagatagarbha, Dharma-dhatu, suchness (tathata).{{sfn|Lusthaus|1998|p=84}}}} most notably ''tathāgatagarbha'' and ''buddhadhātu''.{{refn|group=note|Sanskrit; Jp. ''Busshō'', "Buddha-nature".}} ''Tathāgatagarbha'' means "the womb" or "embryo" (''garbha'') of the "thus-gone" (''tathagata''),{{refn|group=note|Enlightened one, a/the Buddha}} or "containing a tathagata", while ''buddhadhātu'' literally means "Buddha-realm" or "Buddha-substrate".{{refn|group=note|Kevin Trainor: "a sacred nature that is the basis for [beings'] becoming buddhas."{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=207}}}}

''Tathāgatagarbha'' has a wide range of (sometimes conflicting) meanings in Indian and later East Asian and Tibetan Buddhist literature. Debates on what the term means continues to be a major part of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhist]] scholastics.

For example, the Tibetan scholar [[Gö Lotsawa Zhönnu-pel|Go Lotsawa]] outlined four meanings of the term ''Tathāgatagarbha'' as used by Indian Buddhist scholars generally: (1) As an [[Rangtong-Shentong#Rangtong|emptiness that is a nonimplicative negation]], (2) the [[Luminous mind|luminous nature of the mind]], (3) [[Alaya-vijnana|alaya-vijñana]] (store-consciousness), (4) all [[bodhisattva]]s and sentient beings.&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 54"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

===Tathāgatagarbha===
The term ''tathāgatagarbha'' may mean "embryonic tathāgata",{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=44}} "womb of the tathāgata",{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} or "containing a tathagata".{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=45}} Various meanings may all be brought into mind when the term ''tathagatagarbha'' is being used.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=45}}

====Compound====
The Sanskrit term ''tathāgatagarbha'' is a compound of two terms, ''[[tathāgata]]'' and ''garbha'':{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}

====Asian translations====
The Chinese translated the term ''tathāgatagarbha'' as ({{CJKV|t=如来藏|p=rúláizàng}},{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} or "Tathāgata's (''rúlái'') storehouse" (''zàng'').{{sfn|King|1991|p=48}}{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=45}} According to Brown, "storehouse" may indicate both "that which enfolds or contains something",{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=45}} or "that which is itself enfolded, hidden or contained by another."{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=45}} The Tibetan translation is ''de bzhin gsegs pa'i snyin po'', which cannot be translated as "womb" (''mngal'' or ''lhums''), but as "embryonic essence", "kernel" or "heart".{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=45}} The term "heart" was also used by Mongolian translators.{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=45}}

====Western translations====
The term ''tathagatagarbha'' is translated and interpreted in various ways by western translators and scholars:
* According to Sally King, the term ''tathāgatagarbha'' may be understood in two ways:{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}
# "embryonic tathāgata", the incipient Buddha, the ''cause'' of the Tathāgata,
# "womb of the tathāgata", the ''fruit'' of Tathāgata. 
:According to King, the Chinese ''rúláizàng'' was taken in its meaning as "womb" or "fruit".{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} 
* Wayman &amp; Wayman also point out that the Chinese regularly takes ''garbha'' as "womb",{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=ix}} but prefer to use the term "embryo".
* According to Brown, following Wayman &amp; Wayman, "embryo" is the best fitting translation, since it preserves "the dynamic, self-transformative nature of the ''tathagatagarbha''."{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=44}}
* According to Zimmerman, ''garbha'' may also mean the interior or center of something,{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=40}} and its essence or central part.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=41}} As a ''[[tatpurusa]]''{{refn|group=note|In [[Sanskrit grammar]] a '''{{IAST|tatpuruṣa}}''' (तत्पुरुष) compound is a dependent determinative [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]], i.e. a compound XY meaning a type of Y which is related to X in a way corresponding to one of the grammatical cases of X.}} it may refer to a person ''being'' a "womb" for or "container" of the tathagata.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=44}} As a ''[[bahuvrihi]]''{{refn|group=note|A '''bahuvrihi compound''' (from Sanskrit बहुव्रीहि, ''bahuvrīhi'', literally meaning "much rice" but denoting a rich man) is a type of compound that denotes a referent by specifying a certain characteristic or quality the referent possesses.}} it may refer to a person as ''having'' an embryonic tathagata inside.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=44}} In both cases, this embryonic tathagata still has to be developed.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=44}} Zimmerman concludes that ''tathagatagarbha'' is a ''bahuvrihi'', meaning "containing a tathagata",{{refn|group=note|In the ''Maraparinirvana Sutra'' the term ''tathagatagarbha'' replaces the term ''buddhadhatu'', which originally referred to relics. Worship of the physical relics of the Buddha was reshaped into worship of the inner Buddha.{{sfn|Jikido|2000|p=73}}}} but notes the variety of meanings of ''garbha'', such as "containing", "born from", "embryo", "(embracing/concealing) womb", "calyx", "child", "member of a clan", "core", which may all be brought into mind when the term ''tathagatagarbha'' is being used.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2002|p=45}}

===Buddha-nature===
The term "Buddha-nature" ({{CJKV|t=佛性|p=fóxìng}}, {{CJKV|j=busshō}}{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}) is closely related in meaning to the term ''tathāgatagarbha'', but is not a translation of this term.{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}}{{refn|group=note|For the various equivalents of the Sanskrit term "''tathāgatagarbha''" in other languages (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese), see [[Glossary of Buddhism]], "tathagatagarbha"}} It refers to what is essential in the human being.{{sfn|King|1991|p=5}}

The corresponding Sanskrit term is ''buddhadhātu''.{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} It has two meanings, namely the nature of the Buddha, equivalent to the term [[dharmakāya]], and the cause of the Buddha.{{sfn|King|1991|p=4}} The link between the cause and the result is the nature (''dhātu'') which is common to both, namely the dharmadhātu.{{sfn|King|1991|p=5}}

Matsumoto Shirō also points out that "Buddha-nature" translates the Sanskrit-term buddhadhātu, a "place to put something," a "foundation," a "locus."{{sfn|Shirō|1997|p=169}} According to Shirō, it does not mean "original nature" or "essence," nor does it mean the "possibility of the attainment of Buddhahood," "the original nature of the Buddha," or "the essence of the Buddha."{{sfn|Shirō|1997|p=169}}

In the [[Vajrayana]], the term for Buddha-nature is ''sugatagarbha''.

==Indian Sutra sources==
===Earliest sources===
According to Wayman, the idea of the tathagatagarbha is grounded on sayings by the Buddha that there is something called the [[luminous mind]]{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=42}} (''prabhasvara citta''{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=288-289}}), "which is only adventitiously covered over by defilements ([[Kleshas (Buddhism)|agantukaklesa]])"{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=288-289}} The luminous mind is mentioned in a passage from the [[Anguttara Nikaya]]:{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=56}} "Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is defiled by incoming defilements."&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, trans. (1995). [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an01/an01.049.than.html Pabhassara Sutta: Luminous], (Anguttara Nikaya 1.49-52)&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Harvey mentions AN 1.10: "Monks, this mind (''[[citta]]'') is brightly shining (''pabhassara''), but it is defiled by defilements which arrive". AN 1.49-52 gives a similar statement}} The [[Mahāsāṃghika]] school coupled this idea of the luminous mind with the idea of the [[Eight Consciousnesses|mulavijnana]], the substratum consciousness that serves as the basis consciousness.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=42}}

From the idea of the luminous mind emerged the idea that the awakened mind is the pure (''visuddhi''), undefiled mind. In the [[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras|tathagatagarbha-sutras]] it is this pure consciousness that is regarded to be the seed from which Buddhahood grows:
{{quote|When this intrinsically pure consciousness came to be regarded as an element capable of growing into [[Buddhahood]], there was the "embryo (''garbha'') of the Tathagata (&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;Buddha)" doctrine, whether or not this term is employed.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=42}}}}Karl Brunnholzl writes that the first probable mention of the term is in the ''Ekottarika [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agama]]'' (though here it is used in a different way then in later texts). The passage states:&lt;blockquote&gt;If someone devotes himself to the Ekottarikagama, Then he has the ''tathagatagarbha''. Even if his body cannot exhaust defilements in this life, In his next life he will attain supreme wisdom.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This tathāgatagarbha idea was the result of an interplay between various strands of Buddhist thought, on the nature of human consciousness and the means of awakening.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=161}}{{sfn|Lusthaus|1998}}{{sfn|Lai}} Gregory comments on this origin of the Tathagatagarba-doctrine: "The implication of this doctrine [...] is that enlightenment is the natural and true state of the mind."{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=288-289}}

===''Avatamsaka Sutra''===
According to Wayman, the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]'' (1st-3rd century CE) was the next step in the development of the Buddha-nature thought after the concept of the luminous mind:

{{quote|[W]here it is taught that the Buddha's divine knowledge pervades sentient beings, and that its representation in an individual being is the substratum consciousness.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=42}}}}
The ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra'' does not contain a "singular discussion of the concept",{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=44}} but the idea of "a universal penetration of sentient beings by the wisdom of the Buddha (''buddhajñāna'')" was complementary to the concept of the Buddha-womb.{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=44}}
The basic idea of the ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra '' is the unity of the absolute and the relative:

{{quote|All in One, One in All. The All melts into a single whole. There are no divisions in the totality of reality [...] [I]t views the cosmos as holy, as "one bright pearl," the universal reality of the Buddha. The universal Buddhahood of all reality is the religious message of the Avatamsaka-sutra.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=46-47}}{{refn|group=note|Each part of the world reflects the totality of the cosmos:&lt;br&gt;
quote|In each dust-mote of these worlds&lt;br&gt;
Are countless worlds and Buddhas...&lt;br&gt;
From the tip of each hair of Buddha's body&lt;br&gt;
Are revealed the indescribable Pure Lands...&lt;br&gt;
The indescribable infinite Lands&lt;br&gt;
All ensemble in a hair's tip [of Buddha].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=47}}}}}}

All levels of reality are related and interpenetrated. This is depicted in the image of [[Indra's net]]. This "unity in totality allows every individual entity of the phenomenal world its uniqueness without attributing an inherent nature to anything".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=47}}

===''Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra'' ===
The ''[[Lotus Sutra]] (''Skt'': Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra)'', written between 100 BCE and 200 CE, does not mention Buddha-nature, but shares other themes and ideas with the later [[tathāgatagarbha sūtras]] like the ''tathāgatagarbha sūtra'' and some scholars theorize that it was an influence on these texts.&lt;ref name="Reeves"&gt;{{harvnb|Reeves|2008|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenth chapter emphasizes, in accordance with the Bodhisattva-ideal of the Mahayana teachings, that everyone can be liberated. All living beings can become a buddha, not only  monks and nuns, but also laypeople, [[śrāvaka]]s, [[bodhisattva]]s, and non-human creatures.&lt;ref name="Reeves" /&gt; It also details that all living beings can be a 'teacher of the Dharma'.

The twelfth chapter of the ''Lotus Sutra'' details that the potential to become enlightened is universal among all people, even the historical [[Devadatta]] has the potential to become a buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reeves|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Devadatta is followed by another story about a [[Longnü|dragon princess]] who is both a [[nāga]] and a female, whom the bodhisattva [[Manjusri|Mañjuśrī]] proclaims will reach enlightenment immediately, in her present form.

===''Tathāgatagarbha Sūtras''===
{{Main|Tathāgatagarbha sūtras}}
There are several major Indian texts which discuss the idea of Buddha-nature and they are often termed the [[tathāgatagarbha sūtras]]. According to Brunnholzl "the earliest [[mahayana sutras]] that are based on and discuss the notion of tathagatagarbha as the buddha potential that is innate in all sentient beings began to appear in written form in the late second and early third century."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their ideas became very influential in [[East Asian Buddhism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Mahayana sutras which mention this doctrine include the [[Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra|''Tathāgatagarbha sūtra'']], ''[[Anunatva-Apurnatva-Nirdesa]],'' ''[[Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra]],'' ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]], [[Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra]]'' and the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;''

The ''[[Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra]]'' (200-250 CE) is considered (...) "the earliest expression of this (the tathāgatagarbha doctrine) and the term ''tathāgatagarbha'' itself seems to have been coined in this very sutra."{{sfn|Zimmermann|1999|p=143–168}} It states that one is already or primordially awakened and that all beings already have perfect [[buddhahood]] within themselves but do not recognize it because it is covered over by afflictions.&lt;ref&gt;Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' 2008. pp. 152&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=47-48}}{{sfn|Zimmermann|2002|p=39 ff. and 50 ff.}}&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another one of these texts, the ''Ghanavyuha Sutra'' (as quoted by [[Longchenpa]]) states that the tathāgatagarbha is the ground of all things:

{{quote|... the ultimate universal ground also has always been with the Buddha-Essence (Tathagatagarbha), and this essence in terms of the universal ground has been taught by the Tathagata. The fools who do not know it, because of their habits, see even the universal ground as (having) various happiness and suffering and actions and emotional defilements. Its nature is pure and immaculate, its qualities are as wishing-jewels; there are neither changes nor cessations. Whoever realizes it attains Liberation&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Thondup Rinpoche, Tulku (1989). ''Buddha Mind''. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion: p.218&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra''===
The ''Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra'' (3rd century CE{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=2}}), also named ''The Lion's Roar of Queen Srimala'', centers on the teaching of the tathagatagarbha as "ultimate soteriological principle".{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=10}} Regarding the tathāgatagarbha, it states:

{{quote|Lord, the Tathagatagarbha is neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality. The Tathagatagarbha is not the domain of beings who fall into the belief in a real personality, who adhere to wayward views, whose thoughts are distracted by voidness. Lord, this Tathagatagarbha is the embryo of the Illustrious Dharmadhatu, the embryo of the Dharmakaya, the embryo of the supramundane ''dharma'', the embryo of the intrinsically pure ''dharma''.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=106}}}}

In the ''Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra'' there are two possible states for the tathāgatagarbha:

{{quote|[E]ither covered by defilements, when it is called only "embryo of the Tathagata"; or free from defilements, when the "embryo of the Tathagata" is no more the "embryo" (potentiality) but the Tathagata (actuality).{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=45}}}}

The sutra itself states it this way:

{{quote|This Dharmakaya of the Tathagata when not free from the store of defilement is referred to as the Tathagatagarbha.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=98}}}}

===''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra''===
[[File:Sui Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra.JPG|thumb|A [[Sui dynasty]] manuscript of the ''Nirvāṇa Sūtra'']]
The early Buddha-nature concept as expressed in the seminal 'tathagatagarbha sutra' named the ''Nirvana Sutra'' is, according to Kevin Trainor, as follows: "Sentient beings are said to possess a sacred nature that is the basis for them becoming buddhas [...] this buddha-nature is in fact our true nature [...] universal and completely unsullied by whatever psychological and karmic state an individual may be in."{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=207}}

The ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' (written 2nd century CE) was very influential in the Chinese reception of the Buddhist teachings.{{sfn|Lai}} The ''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' linked the concept of tathāgatagarbha with the buddhadhātu.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} Kosho Yamamoto points out that the ''Nirvana Sutra'' contains a series of equations: "Thus, there comes about the equation of: Buddha Body &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; Dharmakaya &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; eternal body &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; eternal Buddha &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; Eternity."{{sfn|Yamamoto|1975}} According to Shimoda Masahiro, the authors of the ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' were  leaders and advocates of stupa worship. The term ''buddhadhātu'' originally referred to relics. In the ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'', it came to be used in place of the concept of ''tathāgatagārbha''. The authors used the teachings of the ''Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra'' to reshape the worship of the physical relics of the Buddha into worship of the inner Buddha as a principle of salvation.{{sfn|Jikido|2000|p=73}} Sasaki, in a review of Shimoda, conveys a key premise of Shimoda's work, namely, that the origins of Mahayana Buddhism and the ''Nirvana Sutra'' are entwined.{{sfn|Sasaki|1999}}

The Buddha-nature is always present, in all times and in all beings. This does not mean that sentient beings are at present endowed with the qualities of a Buddha, but that they will have those qualities in the future.{{sfn|Liu|1982|p=66-67}} It is obscured from worldly vision by the screening effect of tenacious negative mental afflictions within each being.{{refn|group=note|The most notable of which are greed 貪, hatred 嗔, delusion 癡, and pride 慢}} Once these negative mental states have been eliminated, however, the Buddha-dhatu is said to shine forth unimpededly and the Buddha-sphere (Buddha-dhatu/ visaya) can then be consciously "entered into", and therewith deathless Nirvana attained:{{sfn|Yamamoto|1975|p=94–96}}

{{quote|[T]he tathagatagarbha is none but Thusness or the Buddha Nature, and is the originally untainted pure mind which lies overspread by, and exists in, the mind of greed and anger of all beings. This bespeaks a Buddha Body that exists in a state of bondage.{{sfn|Yamamoto|1975|p=87}}}}

According to Sallie B. King, it does not represent a major innovation, and is rather unsystematic,{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} which made it "a fruitful one for later students and commentators, who were obliged to create their own order and bring it to the text".{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} According to King, its most important innovation is the linking of the term ''buddhadhatu'' with ''tathagatagarbha''.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} The sutra presents the Buddha-nature or tathagatagarbha as a "Self". The ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' refers to a true self.  "The ''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṅa Sūtra'', especially influential in East Asian Buddhist thought, goes so far as to speak of it as our true self (ātman). Its precise metaphysical and ontological status is, however, open to interpretation in the terms of different Mahāyāna philosophical schools; for the Madhyamikas it must be empty of its own existence like everything else; for the Yogacarins, following the Laṅkāvatāra, it can be identified with store consciousness, as the receptacle of the seeds of awakening.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=52}}  Paul Williams states: "[...] it is obvious that the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' does not consider it impossible for a Buddhist to affirm an atman provided it is clear what the correct understanding of this concept is, and indeed the sutra clearly sees certain advantages in doing so."{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=163-164}} but it speaks about Buddha-nature in so many different ways, that Chinese scholars created a list of types of Buddha-nature that could be found in the text.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} Paul Williams also notes:

{{quote|Nevertheless the sutra as it stands is quite clear that while [...] we can speak of [the tathagatagharba] as Self, actually it is not at all a Self, and those who have such Self-notions cannot perceive the tathagatagarbha and thus become enlightened (see Ruegg 1989a: 21-6).{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=163-164}}}}

===''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra''===
The ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'' (compiled 350-400 CE&lt;ref name="KaluPhy"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.fi/books?id=SlDArya3YvcC&amp;lpg=PA275&amp;ots=ISCxmxGp_c&amp;dq=A%20history%20of%20Buddhist%20philosophy&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20history%20of%20Buddhist%20philosophy&amp;f=false|title=A History of Buddhist Philosophy: Continuities and Discontinuities|last1=Kalupahana|first1=David J.|date=1992|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824814021|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) synthesized the tathagatagarba-doctrine and the [[Eight Consciousnesses#Ālayavijñāna|ālāya-vijñāna]] doctrine. The Lankavatara Sutra "assimilates Tathagata-garbha thought to the Yogacara-viewpoint, and this assimilation is further developed in [...] The Treatise on the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana".{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=114}} According to the Lankavatara Sutra ''tathāgatagarbha'' is identical to the ''ālaya-vijñāna'', known prior to awakening as the storehouse-consciousness or 8th consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, D.T., trans. (1932) ''The Lankavatara Sutra''. London: Routledge &amp; Kegen Paul: Section LXXXII, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The ālāya-vijñāna is supposed to contain the pure seed, or tathagatagarbha, from which awakening arises.{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=288-289}}

The Lankavatara-sutra contains tathagata-garba thought, but also warns against reification of the idea of Buddha-nature, and presents it as an aid to attaining awakening:

{{quote|Is not this Tathagata-garbha taught by the Blessed One the same as the ego-substance taught by the philosophers? The ego as taught by the philosophers is an eternal creator, unqualified, omnipresent, and imperishable.&lt;br&gt;
The Blessed One replied: [...] it is emptiness, reality-limit, Nirvana, being unborn, unqualified, and devoid of will-effort; the reason why the Tathagatas [...] teach the doctrine pointing to the Tathagata-garba is to make the ignorant cast aside their fear when they listen to the teaching of egolessness and to have them realise the state of non-discrimination and imagelessness&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, D.T. (1956), ''The Lankavatara Sutra. A Mahayana Text.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd. p.69&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Alex and Hideko Wayman, the equation of tathagatagarbha and ālāya-vijñāna in the Lankavatara fails:

{{quote|It is plain that when the ''Lankavatara-sutra'' identifies the two terms, this scripture necessarily diverges in the meaning of one or both of the terms from the usage of the term Tathagatagarbha in the earlier ''Sri-Mala'' or of the term ''ālāya-vijñāna '' in the subsequent Yogacara school.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|In the [[Menngagde|Seminal Heart]] series of [[Dzogchen]] a distinction is made between ''kun gzhi'', c.q. ''ālaya'', "the base of it all", the samsaric basis of consciousness, of all the samsaric appearances; and ''[[Ground (Dzogchen)|gzhi]]'', "the nirvanic basis known as the ground."{{sfn|Schaik|2004}} Sam van Schaik: "....the Seminal Heart distinction between two types of basis, the nirvanic basis known as the ground (gzhi) and the samsaric basis of consciousness, the ālaya (kun gzhi).{{sfn|Schaik|2004}} [[Philip Kapleau]], in "The Three Pillars of Zen", drawing from Harada roshi, discerns a "Pure Consciousness" or "Formless Self" underlying the ālāya-vijñāna.{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}} This 9th consciousness was also mentioned by Paramārtha, a 6th century Indian translator working in China.{{sfn|Lusthaus|1998|p=84}}}}}}

==In Indian commentaries==
The ''tathāgatagarbha'' doctrine was also widely discussed by Indian Mahayana scholars in treatises or commentaries, called [[shastra|śāstra]], the most influential of which was the [[Ratnagotravibhāga]] (5th century CE).

===''Ratnagotravibhāga'' or ''Uttaratantraśāstra''===
The [[Ratnagotravibhāga]], also called ''Uttaratantraśāstra'' (5th century CE), is an Indian [[shastra|śāstra]] in which synthesised all the major elements and themes of the tathāgatagārbha theory.{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=44}} It gives an overview of authoritative tathāgatagarbha sutras, mentioning the ''Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra'', the ''Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra'', ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'', the ''[[Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra]]'', the ''[[Anunatva-Apurnatva-Nirdesa]]'' and the ''Mahābherīharaka-sūtra''.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=43}} It presents the tathāgatagarbha as "an ultimate, unconditional reality that is simultaneously the inherent, dynamic process towards its complete manifestation".{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=46}} Mundane and enlightened reality are seen as complementary:

{{quote|Thusness [''tathata''] defiled is the Tathagatagarbha, and Thusness undefiled is Enlightenment.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=45}}}}

In the ''Ratnagotravibhāga'', the tathāgatagarbha is seen as having three specific characteristics: (1) [[Dharmakāya|dharmakaya]], (2) [[suchness]], and (3) disposition, as well as the general characteristic (4) non-[[Conceptual proliferation|conceptuality]].&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 54"/&gt;

According to the ''Ratnagotravibhāga'', all sentient beings have "the embryo of the Tathagata" in three senses:{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=46}}

# the Tathāgata's dharmakāya permeates all sentient beings;
# the Tathāgata's ''[[tathatā]]'' is omnipresent (''avyatibheda'');
# the Tathāgata's species (''gotra'', a synonym for tathagatagarbha) occurs in them.

The Ratnagotravibhāga equates enlightenment with the nirvāṇa-realm and the dharmakāya.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=45}} It gives a variety of synonyms for ''garbha'', the most frequently used being ''gotra'' and ''dhatu''.{{sfn|Brown|1994|p=46}}

This text also explains the tathāgatagarbha in terms of [[luminous mind]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;The luminous nature of the mind Is unchanging, just like space.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Madhyamaka school ===
Indian [[Madhyamaka]] philosophers interpreted the theory as a description of [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] and as a non implicative negation. [[Bhāviveka|Bhaviveka]]'s ''Tarkajvala'' states:&lt;blockquote&gt;[The expression] “possessing the tathagata heart” is [used] because emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, and so on, exist in the mind streams of all sentient beings. However, it is not something like a permanent and all-pervasive person that is the inner agent. For we find [passages] such as “All phenomena have the nature of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. What is emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness is the Tathagata.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Chandrakirti|Candrakirti]]'s ''Madhyamakāvatārabhāsya'' states:&lt;blockquote&gt;One should know that since [the alaya-consciousness] follows the nature of all entities, it is nothing but emptiness that is taught through the term “alaya-consciousness.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Gö Lotsawa Zhönnu-pel|Go Lotsawa]] states that this statement is referencing the tathāgatagarbha doctrine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Candrakirti's ''Madhyamakāvatārabhāsya'' also argues, basing itself on the Lankavatara sutra, that "the statement of the emptiness of sentient beings being a buddha adorned with all major and minor marks is of expedient meaning".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Kamalaśīla|Kamalasila]]'s (c. 740-795) ''Madhyamakaloka'' associates tathāgatagarbha with [[Luminous mind|luminosity]] and luminosity with [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;This statement “All sentient beings possess the tathāgata heart” teaches that all are suitable to attain the state of unsurpassable completely perfect awakening since it is held that the term tathāgata expresses that the dharmadhātu, which is characterized by personal and phenomenal identitylessness, is natural luminosity.&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 56"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Uniquely among [[Madhyamaka]] texts, some texts attributed to [[Nagarjuna]], mainly poetic works like the ''[[Dharmadhātustava|Dharmadhatustava]], Cittavajrastava'', and ''Bodhicittavivarana'' associate the term tathāgatagarbha with the [[Luminous mind|luminous nature of the mind]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Yogacara scholars===
{{See also|Eight Consciousnesses#Transformations of consciousness|l1=Transformations of consciousness}}

According to Brunnholzl, "all early Indian Yogacara masters (such as [[Asanga]], [[Vasubandhu]], [[Sthiramati]], and Asvabhava), if they refer to the term tathāgatagarbha at all, always explain it as nothing but [[Tathātā|suchness]] in the sense of twofold identitylessness".&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 56"/&gt;

Some later Yogacara scholars spoke of the tathāgatagarbha in more positive terms, such as Jñanasrimitra who in his ''Sakarasiddhi'' equates it with the appearances of lucidity (prakasarupa). Likewise, Brunnholzl notes that "[[Ratnākaraśānti|Ratnakarasanti]] generally describes the tathagata heart as being equivalent to naturally luminous mind, nondual self-awareness, and the perfect nature (which he considers to be an implicative negation and not a nonimplicative negation)."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alaya-vijñana ===
The Yogacara concept of the [[Eight Consciousnesses|alaya-vijñana]] (store consciousness) also came to be associated by some scholars with the tathāgatagarbha. This can be seen in sutras like the Lankavatara, the Srimaladevi and in the translations of [[Paramartha]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the ālaya-vijñāna originally meant defiled consciousness: defiled by the workings of [[Ayatana|the five senses and the mind]]. It was also seen as the mūla-vijñāna, the base-consciousness or "stream of consciousness" from which awareness and perception spring.&lt;ref name="KaluPsy"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Principles%20of%20Buddhist%20Psychology_Kalupahana.pdf|title=The Principles of Buddhist Psychology|last1=Kalupahana|first1=David J.|date=1987|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=9780887064043|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To account for the notion of Buddha-nature in all beings, with the Yogacara belief in the [[Yogacara#Five Categories of Beings|Five Categories of Beings]], Yogacara scholars in China such as Tz'u-en (慈恩, 632-682) the first patriarch in China, advocated two types of nature: the latent nature found in all beings (理佛性) and the Buddha-nature in practice (行佛性). The latter nature was determined by the innate [[Bīja|seeds]] in the alaya.&lt;ref name="groner"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Establishment of the Tendai School|last=Groner|first=Paul|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2000|isbn=0824823710|pages=97–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trikaya doctrine===
Around 300 CE, the Yogacara school systematized the prevalent ideas on the nature of the Buddha in the [[Trikaya]] or ''three-body doctrine''. According to this doctrine, Buddhahood has three aspects:{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=126}}
# The Nirmana-kaya, or ''Transformation-body'', the earthly manifestation of the Buddha;
# The [[Sambhogakāya]], or ''Enjoyment-body'', a subtle body, by which the Buddha appears to bodhisattvas to teach them;
# The Dharmakāya, or ''Dharma-body'', the ultimate nature of the Buddha, and the ultimate nature of reality.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

They may be described as follows:
{{quote|The first is the 'Knowledge-body' (''Jnana-kaya''), the inner nature shared by all Buddhas, their Buddha-ness (''buddhata'')&lt;br&gt;[...] The second aspect of the ''Dharma-body'' is the 'Self-existent-body' (''Svabhavika-kaya''). This is the ultimate nature of reality, thusness, emptiness: the non-nature which is the very nature of ''dharmas'', their ''dharma''-ness (''dharmata''). It is the ''Tathagata-garbha'' and ''[[bodhicitta]]'' hidden within beings, and the transformed 'storehouse-consciousness'.}}

==In Chinese Buddhism==
The [[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras|tathāgatagarbha]] idea was extremely influential in the development of [[East Asian Buddhism]].{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=161}} When Buddhism was introduced to China, in the 1st century CE, Buddhism was understood through comparisons of its teachings to Chinese terms and ways of thinking. Chinese Buddhist thinkers like Zhi Mindu, Zhidun, and Huiyuan (d. 433) interpreted Buddhist concepts in terms of the Chinese [[Xuanxue|neo-daoist]] philosophy called ‘dark learning’ (''xuanxue'').&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Hurley, Scott, The doctrinal transformation of twentieth-century Chinese Buddhism: Master Yinshun’s interpretation of the tathagatagarbha doctrine, Contemporary Buddhism, Vol. 5, No. 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency was only later countered by the work of [[East Asian Mādhyamaka|Chinese Madhyamaka]] scholar-translators like [[Kumārajīva|Kumarajiva]].

The buddha nature idea was introduced into China with the translation of the [[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra|Mahaparanirvana sutra]] in the early fifth century and this text became the central source of buddha nature doctrine in Chinese Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Liu , Ming-Wood. The Yogaacaaraa and Maadhyamika Interpretation of the Buddha-nature Concept in Chinese Buddhism, Philosophy East and West, Volume 35, no. 2, April 1985 P.171-192 © by University of Hawaii Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra some Chinese Buddhists supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.{{sfn|Lai|p=11}} This idea was interpreted as being similar to the ideas of [[Tao|Dao]] and [[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|Principle (Li)]] in Chinese philosophy.

===The Awakening of Faith===
[[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana|The Awakening of Faith]] was very influential in the development of Chinese Buddhism {{sfn|Lai}} said to have been translated by [[Paramartha]] (499-569). While the text is traditionally attributed to [[{{IAST|Aśvaghoṣa}}]], no Sanskrit version of the text is extant. The earliest known versions are written in Chinese, and contemporary scholars believe that the text is a Chinese composition.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan. The Heart Sūtra: A Chinese Apocryphal Text? ''Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'' Vol. 15 (2), 180-81, 1992. [http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8800/2707 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chinese Buddhist Apocrypha'' by Robert E. Buswell. University of Hawaii Press: 1990. {{ISBN|0-8248-1253-0}}. pgs 1-29&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana'' offers a synthesis of Chinese buddhist thinking.{{sfn|Lai|p=11-12}} It sees the Buddha-nature doctrine as a cosmological theory, in contrast to the Indo-Tibetan tradition, where the soteriological aspect is emphasized.{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=109-110}} It described the "One Mind" which "includes in itself all states of being of the phenomenal and transcendental world".{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=109-110}} It tried to harmonize the ideas of the tathāgatagarbha and ālāya-vijñāna:
{{quote|In the words of the Awakening of Faith — which summarizes the essentials of Mahayana — self and world, mind and suchness, are integrally one. Everything is a carrier of that a priori enlightenment; all incipient enlightenment is predicated on it. The mystery of existence is, then, not, "How may we overcome alienation?" The challenge is, rather, "Why do we think we are lost in the first place?"{{sfn|Lai}}}}

In the Awakening of Faith the 'one mind' has two aspects, namely tathata, suchness, the things as they are, and samsara, the cycle of birth and death.{{sfn|Lai|p=11-12}} This text was in line with an essay by [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wu]] of the [[Liang dynasty]] (reign 502-549 CE), in which he postulated a pure essence, the enlightened mind, trapped in darkness, which is ignorance. By this ignorance the pure mind is trapped in samsara. This resembles the tathāgatagarba and the idea of the defilement of the luminous mind.{{sfn|Lai|p=11-12}} In a commentary on this essay [[Shen Yue]] stated that insight into this true essence is awakened by stopping the thoughts - a point of view which is also being found in the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'' of [[Huineng]].{{sfn|Lai|p=11-12}}

The joining together of these different ideas supported the notion of the [[ekayāna]], the one vehicle: absolute oneness, all-pervading Buddha-wisdom and [[hongaku|original enlightenment]] as a holistic whole. This synthesis was a reflection of the unity which was attained in China with the united [[Song dynasty]].{{sfn|Lai|p=12-13}}

=== In Chinese Yogacara and Madhyamaka ===
By the 6th century CE buddha nature had been well established in Chinese Buddhism and a wide variety of theories developed to explain it.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; One influential figure who wrote about buddha nature was Ching-ying Hui-yuan (523-592 CE), a [[East Asian Yogācāra|Chinese Yogacarin]] who argued for a kind of idealism which held that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"All dharmas without exception originate and are formed from the true[-mind], and other than the true[-mind], there exists absolutely nothing which can give rise to false thoughts."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Ching-ying Hui-yuan equated this 'true mind' with the alaya-vijñana, the tathāgatagarbha and "Buddha-nature" (''fóxìng'') and held that it was an essence, a true consciousness and a metaphysical principle that ensured that all sentient beings will reach enlightenment.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; According to Ming-Wood Liu "Hui-yuan's interpretation of the Buddha-nature doctrine represents the culmination of a long process of transformation of the "Buddha-nature" from a basically practical to an ontological concept."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The Chinese Yogacara school was also split on the relationship between the tathāgatagarbha and ālayavijñāna. Fa-shang (495-580), representing the southern Yogacara, asserted that they were separate, that the alaya was illusiory and impure while buddha nature was the ultimate source of all phenomenal reality.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Seong-Uk Kim, Understanding Tsung-Mi's view on Buddha nature, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern school meanwhile, it was held that the alaya and buddha nature were the same pure support for all phenomena.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; In the sixth and seventh centuries, the Yogacara theory became associated with a substantialist non-dual metaphysics which saw buddha nature as an eternalistic ground. This idea was promoted by figures like [[Fazang]] and Ratnamati.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In contrast with the Chinese Yogacara view, the [[East Asian Mādhyamaka|Chinese Madhyamaka]] scholar [[Jizang]] (549–623 CE) sought to remove all ontological connotations of the term as a metaphysical reality and saw buddha nature as being synonymous with terms like "[[Tathātā|tathata]]," "[[dharmadhatu]]," "ekayana," "wisdom, &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; "ultimate reality," "middle way" and also the wisdom that contemplates [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In formulating his view, Jizang was influenced by the earlier Chinese Madhyamaka thinker [[Sengzhao]] (384–414 CE) who was a key figure in outlining an understanding of emptiness which was based on the Indian sources and not on Daoist concepts which previous Chinese Buddhists had used.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Jizang used the compound “Middle Way-buddha nature” (''zhongdao foxing'' 中道佛 性) to refer to his view.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;CHIH-MIEN ADRIAN TSENG, A COMPARISON OF THE CONCEPTS OF BUDDHA-NATURE AND DAO-NATURE OF MEDIEVAL CHINA.&lt;/ref&gt; Jizang was also one of the first Chinese philosophers to famously argue that plants and insentient objects have Buddha nature, which he also termed true reality and universal principle (''dao'').&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In the 20th century, the influential Chinese master [[Yin Shun]] drew on Chinese Madhyamaka to argue against any Yogacara influenced view that buddha nature was an underlying permanent ground of reality and instead supported the view that buddha nature teachings are just an expedient means.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Yin Shun, drawing on his study of Indian Madhyamaka promoted the emptiness of all things as the ultimate Buddhist truth, and argued that the buddha nature teaching was a provisional teaching taught in order to ease the fear of some Buddhists regarding emptiness as well as to attract those people who have an affinity to the idea of a Self or [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Later after taking up the Buddhist path, they would be introduced to the truth of emptiness.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== In Tiantai ===
In the [[Tiantai]] school, the primary figure is the scholar [[Zhiyi]]. According to Paul L. Swanson, none of Zhiyi's works discuss buddha nature explicitly at length however. Yet it is still an important concept in his philosophy, which is seen as synonymous with the [[Ekayāna|ekayana]] principle outlined in the [[Lotus Sutra]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Swanson, Paul L, T'ien-t'ai Chih-i's Concept of Threefold Buddha Nature-A Synergy of Reality, Wisdom, and Practice&lt;/ref&gt; Swanson argues that for Zhiyi, buddha nature is:&lt;blockquote&gt;an active threefold process which involves the way reality is, the wisdom to see reality as it is, and the practice required to attain this wisdom. Buddha Nature is threefold: the three aspects of reality, wisdom, and practice are interdependent--one aspect does not make any sense without the others.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Buddha nature for Zhiyi therefore has three aspects which he bases on passages from the [[Lotus Sutra|Lotus sutra]] and the Nirvana sutra:&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

# The direct cause of attaining Buddhahood, the innate potential in all sentient beings to become Buddhas, which is the aspect of 'true nature', the way things are.
# The complete cause of attaining Buddhahood, which is the aspect of wisdom that illuminates the true nature and the goal of practice.
# The conditional causes of attaining Buddhahood, which is the aspect of the practices and activities that lead to Buddhahood.

The later Tiantai scholar [[Zhanran]] would expand the Tiantai view of buddha nature, which he saw as synonymous with [[Tathātā|suchness]], to argue for the idea that insentient rocks and plants also have buddha nature.&lt;ref&gt;Shuman Chen. Buddha-Nature of Insentient Beings. Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion , 2nd ed., vol. 1, pp. 208-212, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Chan Buddhism===
In [[Chan Buddhism]], buddha nature tends to be seen as the (non-substantial) essential nature of all beings. But the Zen tradition also emphasizes that buddha nature is [[śūnyatā]], the absence of an independent and substantial "self".{{sfn|Lai}}

''Ch'an and Zen Teaching First Series''.  Berkeley, CA.: Shambala publications: Part I: ''Master Hsu Yun's Discourses and Dharma Words'': pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; have all taught that the process of awakening begins with the light of the mind turning around within the 8th consciousness, so that the ''ālayavijñāna'', also known as the ''tathāgatagarbha'', is transformed into the "bright mirror wisdom". The ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' presents the Chan/Zen Buddhist view of the ''tathāgatagarbha'':
{{quote|[The Buddha said,] Now, Mahāmati, what is perfect knowledge? It is realised when one casts aside the discriminating notions of form, name, reality, and character; it is the inner realisation by noble wisdom. This perfect knowledge, Mahāmati, is the essence of the Tathāgata-garbha.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, D.T., trans. (1932) ''The Lankavatara Sutra''. London: Routledge &amp; Kegen Paul: p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When this active transformation is complete, the other seven consciousnesses are also transformed. The 7th consciousness of delusive discrimination becomes transformed into the "equality wisdom". The 6th consciousness of thinking sense becomes transformed into the "profound observing wisdom", and the 1st to 5th consciousnesses of the five sensory senses become transformed into the "all-performing wisdom".

The Chan master [[Mazu Daoyi]] (709–788) developed a radical interpretation of buddha nature, famously stating that it was nothing less than ordinary mind and that all beings were already enlightened from the start.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

The influential Chan patriarch [[Guifeng Zongmi]] (780–841) interpreted Buddha nature as “empty tranquil awareness” (''k’ung-chi chih''), which he took from the Ho-tse school of Chan.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Following the Srimala sutra, he interpreted the theory of emptiness as presented in the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñaparamita]] sutras as provisional and saw buddha nature as the definitive teaching of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

According to Heng-Ching Shih, the teaching of the universal Buddha-nature does not intend to assert the existence of substantial, entity-like self endowed with excellent features of a Buddha. Rather, Buddha-nature simply represents the potentiality to be realized in the future.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;Heng-Ching Shih, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130807082256/http://budsas.org/ebud/ebdha191.htm The Significance Of 'Tathagatagarbha' -- A Positive Expression Of 'Sunyata']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hsing Yun]], forty-eighth patriarch of the [[Linji school]], equates the Buddha-nature with the dharmakāya in line with pronouncements in key tathāgatagarbha sūtras. He defines these two as:
{{quote|the inherent nature that exists in all beings. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, enlightenment is a process of uncovering this inherent nature … The Buddha nature [is] identical with transcendental reality. The unity of the Buddha with everything that exists.&lt;ref&gt;Hsing Yun, Master; tr. by Tom Graham (1999). ''Being Good: Buddhist Ethics for Everyday Life''. New York: Weatherhill: pp. 152-153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BJ010/bj010146307.pdf 現代禪宗心性思想研究的幾點評論]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Korean Buddhism==
In the Korean ''[[Vajrasamadhi-sutra|Vajrasamādhi Sūtra]]'' (685 CE), the tathāgatagarbha is presented as being possessed of two elements, one essential, immutable, changeless and still, the other active and salvational:
{{quote|This "dharma of the one mind", which is the "original tathagatagarbha", is said to be "calm and motionless" ... The ''Vajrasamadhi'''s analysis of tathagatagarbha also recalls a distinction the Awakening of Faith makes between the calm, unchanging essence of the mind and its active, adaptable function [...] The tathagatagarbha is equated with the "original edge of reality" (''bhutakoti'') that is beyond all distinctions - the equivalent of original enlightenment, or the essence. But tathagatagarbha is also the active functioning of that original enlightenment - 'the inspirational power of that fundamental faculty' .... The tathagatagarbha is thus both the 'original edge of reality' that is beyond cultivation (&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; essence) as well as the specific types of wisdom and mystical talents that are the byproducts of enlightenment (&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; function).&lt;ref&gt;Buswell, Robert E. Jr. (2007). ''Cultivating Original Enlightenment''. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press: p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Japanese Buddhism==

===Nichiren Buddhism===
[[Nichiren]] (1222–1282) was a Buddhist monk who taught devotion to the ''Lotus Sutra'' as the exclusive means to attain enlightenment, and the chanting of [[Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō]] as the essential practice of the teaching. [[Nichiren Buddhism]] includes various schools with diverging interpretations of Nichiren's teachings.

Nichiren Buddhism views the Buddha nature as "The inner potential for attaining Buddhahood", common to all people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=The English Buddhist Dictionary Committee |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism |publisher=Soka Gakkai |year=2002 |location=Tōkyō |pages= |url=http://www.sgilibrary.org/dict.html |doi= |id= |isbn=978-4-412-01205-9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530075716/http://www.sgilibrary.org/dict.html |archivedate=May 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on the ''Lotus Sutra'', Nichiren maintained that "all living being possess the Buddha nature",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=584&amp;m=3&amp;q=all%20living%20beings%20possess%20the%20Buddha%20nature. All Living Beings Possess Buddha Nature]&lt;/ref&gt; being the inherent potential to attain Buddhahood: "The Buddha nature refers to the potential for attaining Buddhahood, a state of awakening filled with compassion and wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sokaspirit.org/study/new-light/buddhism-in-new-light-chapter-17-freeing-the-caged-bird-within?set_language=es Freeing the caged bird within] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729152739/http://www.sokaspirit.org/study/new-light/buddhism-in-new-light-chapter-17-freeing-the-caged-bird-within?set_language=es |date=July 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis in Nichiren Buddhism is on "revealing the Buddha nature" - or attaining Buddhahood – in this lifetime &lt;ref&gt;The Gosho Translation Committee: [http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=3 ''The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, Volume I''], Tokyo: Soka Gakkai, 2006.  {{ISBN|4-412-01024-4}}; pp.3 - 5 (On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime)&lt;/ref&gt; through chanting the name of the Dharma of the Lotus Sutra: "[T]the Buddha nature within us is summoned forth and manifested by our chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=887&amp;m=3&amp;q=When%20we%20revere%20Myoho-renge-kyo%20inherent When we rever Myoho-renge-kyo inherent]&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential for Buddhahood exists in the whole spectrum of the [[Ten spiritual realms|Ten Worlds]] of life, and this means that all people, including evil doers, have Buddha nature,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=923&amp;m=3&amp;q=all the beings Sokai Gakka International: All the beings]&lt;/ref&gt; which remains as a dormant possibility or a theoretical potential in the field of emptiness or non-substantiality until it is materialized in reality through Buddhist practice.

In his letter "Opening the Eyes of Wooden and painted Images" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=85 Opening the Eyes of Wooden and painted Images]&lt;/ref&gt; Nichiren explains that insentient matter (such as trees, mandalas, images, statues) also possess the Buddha nature, because they serve as objects of worship. This view regards the Buddha nature as the original nature of all manifestations of life – sentient and insentient – through their interconnectedness:

The founder of the [[Sōtō school]] of [[Zen Buddhism]], [[Dōgen Zenji]], held that Buddha-nature (''busshō'' 佛性) was simply the true nature of reality and Being. This true nature was just impermanence, becoming and 'vast emptiness'. Because he saw the whole universe as an expression of Buddha-nature, he held that even grass and trees are Buddha nature. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, the very impermanency of grass and tree, thicket and forest is the Buddha nature. The very impermanency of men and things, body and mind, is the Buddha nature. Nature and lands, mountains and rivers, are impermanent because they are the Buddha nature. Supreme and complete enlightenment, because it is impermanent, is the Buddha nature.&lt;ref name=Dumoulin&gt;Dumoulin, Heinrich. Zen Buddhism, Volume 2: A History, "Section 2, Dogen" p. 51-119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The founder of [[Sanbō Kyōdan]] lineage of Zen Buddhism, [[Hakuun Yasutani|Yasutani Haku'un Roshi]], also defined Buddha-nature in terms of the emptiness and impermanence of all dharmas:
{{quote|Everything by its very nature is subject to the process of infinite transformation - this is its Buddha- or Dharma-nature. 
What is the substance of this Buddha- or Dharma-nature? In Buddhism it is called ''ku'' (shunyata). Now, ''ku'' is not mere emptiness. It is that which is living, dynamic, devoid of mass, unfixed, beyond individuality or personality--the matrix of all phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Kapleau. ''Three Pillars of Zen''. Anchor books, Doubleday. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A famous reference to Buddha-nature in the Zen-tradition is the [[Mu (negative)|Mu-koan]]:
{{quote|A monk asked [[Zhaozhou Congshen]], a Chinese Zen master (known as ''Jōshū'' in Japanese), "Has a dog Buddha-nature or not?" Zhaozhou answered, "It does not."

===Shin Buddhism===
The founder of the [[Jōdo Shinshū]] of [[Pure Land Buddhism]], [[Shinran]], equated Buddha-Nature with [[shinjin]].&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of Shinran, 1997, Jodo Shinshu Hongwanji-ha&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tibetan Buddhism==
{{Main|Rangtong|Shentong}}
In [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] scholastics, there are two main camps of interpreting buddha nature. There are those who argue that ''tathāgatagarbha'' is just emptiness (described either as [[dharmadhatu]], the nature of phenomena, or a nonimplicative negation) and there are those who see it as the union of the mind's emptiness and luminosity (which includes the buddha qualities).&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gelug]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] favors what is called the ''[[Rangtong-Shentong|rangtong]]'' interpretation of [[Prasaṅgika]] Madhyamaka philosophy.{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=107-108}} They thus interpret Buddha nature as an expedient term for the emptiness of inherent existence. Other schools, especially the [[Jonang]],{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=107}} and [[Kagyu]] have tended to accept the [[shentong]], "other-empty", Madhyamaka philosophy, which discerns an Absolute which "is empty of adventitious defilements which are intrinsically other than it, but is not empty of its own inherent existence".{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=108}}

These interpretations of the tathagatagarbha-teachings has been a matter of intensive debates in Tibet.{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=105-109}}

===Gelug===
An early Tibetan translator, [[Ngok Loden Sherab|Ngok Lotsawa]] (1050-1109) argues in his commentary to the Uttaratantra that Buddha nature is a non-implicative negation, which is to say that it is emptiness, as a ''total negation'' of inherent existence (''svabhava'') that does not imply that anything is left un-negated (in terms of its ''svabhava''). Another early figure, Chaba Chokyi Senge also argued that Buddha nature was a non-implicative negation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadampa]] tradition generally followed [[Ngok Loden Sherab|Ngok Lotsawa]] by holding that Buddha nature was a nonimplicative negation. The [[Gelug]] school, which sees itself as a continuation of the Kadampas, also hold this view, while also holding, as Chaba did, that Buddha nature teachings are of expedient meaning.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

[[Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama|Kedrub Jé Geleg Balsang]] (1385-1438), one of the main disciples of Tsongkhapa, defined the tathāgatagarbha thus:&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is the emptiness of mind’s being empty of being really established that is called “the naturally pure true nature of the mind.” The naturally pure true nature of the mind in its phase of not being free from adventitious stains is called “sugata heart” or “naturally abiding disposition."&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Brunnholzl states that the view of [[Gyaltsab Je|Gyaltsab Darma Rinchen]] (1364-1432) is "that the tathàgata heart is the state of a being in whom mind's emptiness is obscured, while buddhas by definition do not possess this tathàgata heart."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The [[14th Dalai Lama]] sees the Buddha-nature as the "original clear light of mind", but points out that it ultimately does not exist independently, because, like all other phenomena, it is of the nature of emptiness:
{{quote|Once one pronounces the words "emptiness" and "absolute", one has the impression of speaking of the same thing, in fact of the absolute. If emptiness must be explained through the use of just one of these two terms, there will be confusion. I must say this; otherwise you might think that the innate original clear light as absolute truth really exists.&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama, the (1999). ''Buddha Heart, Buddha Mind''. New York: Crossroad: p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Sakya ===
[[Sakya Pandita]] (1182-1251) sees the buddha nature as the [[dharmadhatu]] free from all reference points, and states that the teaching that buddha nature exists in all beings is of expedient meaning and that its basis is emptiness, citing [[Chandrakirti|Candrakirti]]'s ''Madhyamakāvatārabhāsya''.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sakya scholar Rongtön meanwhile, argued that buddha nature is [[Tathātā|suchness]], with stains, or [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] of the mind with stains.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakya scholar [[Buton Rinchen Drub]] (1290–1364), like the Gelugpas, held that the Buddha nature teachings were of expedient meaning and that that the naturally abiding disposition is nothing but emptiness, however unlike them, his view was that the basis for these teachings is the alaya-vijñana and also that buddha nature is the dharmakaya of a buddha but "never exists in the great mass of sentient beings".&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 68"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Brunnholzl, in the works of the influential Sakya scholar [[Gorampa|Gorampa Sonam Senge]] (1429-1489), buddha nature is &lt;blockquote&gt;"nondual unity of minds lucidity and emptiness or awareness and emptiness free from all reference points. It is not mere emptiness because sheer emptiness cannot be the basis of both samsára and nirvána. However, it is not mere lucidity either because this lucidity is a conditioned entity and the tathágata heart is unconditioned."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Sakya Chokden]] meanwhile argues that the ultimate buddha nature is "minds natural luminosity free from all extremes of reference points, which is the sphere of personally experienced wisdom and an implicative negation."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jonang===
The [[Jonang]] school, whose foremost historical figure was the Tibetan scholar-monk [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]] (1292–1361), sees the Buddha-nature as the very ground of the Buddha himself, as the "permanent indwelling of the Buddha in the basal state".&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Jeffrey, trans. (2006). ''Mountain Doctrine: Tibet's Fundamental Treatise on Other-Emptiness and the Buddha-Matrix.'' NY: Snow Lion: p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brunnholzl, Dolpopa, basing himself on certain ''tathāgatagarbha'' sutras, argued that the buddha nature is "ultimately really established, everlasting, eternal, permanent, immutable (therzug), and being beyond dependent origination."&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 68"/&gt; This is the foundation of what is called the [[Rangtong-Shentong|Shentong]] view.

Moreover, the Buddhist tantric scripture entitled ''Chanting the Names of Mañjuśrī ({{IAST|Mañjuśrī-nāma-saṅgīti}})'', repeatedly exalts, as portrayed by Dolpopa, not the non-Self but the Self, and applies the following terms to this ultimate reality : 'The Buddha-Self, the beginningless Self, the solid Self, the diamond Self'. These terms are applied in a manner which reflects the cataphatic approach to Buddhism, typical of much of Dolpopa's writings.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hopkins, Jeffrey, trans. (2006). ''Mountain Doctrine: Tibet's Fundamental Treatise on Other-Emptiness and the Buddha-Matrix.'' NY: Snow Lion: pp.279-280&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Cyrus Stearns writes that Dolpopa's attitude to the 'third turning of the wheel' doctrines (i.e. the Buddha-nature teachings) is that they "are the final definitive statements on the nature of ultimate reality, the primordial ground or substratum beyond the chain of dependent origination, and which is only empty of other, relative phenomena."&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Cyrus Stearns, ''The Buddha from Dolpo: A Study of the Life and Thought of the Tibetan Master Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen'', State University of New York Press, Albany, 1999, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nyingma===
In the [[Nyingma]] school doctrines on buddha nature are generally marked by the tendency to align the idea with [[Dzogchen]] views as well as with [[Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction|Prasangika]] [[Madhyamaka]], beginning with the work of [[Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo|Rongzom]] (1042-1136) and continuing into the work of [[Longchenpa]] (1308-1364) and [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham (1846- 1912)]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham Rinpoche]], the most authoritative figure in modern Nyingma, adopted a view of buddha nature as the unity of appearance and emptiness, relating it to the descriptions of the Ground in Dzogchen as outlined by Longchenpa. This ground is said to be primordially pure (ka dag) and spontaneously present (Ihun grub).&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germano writes that Dzogchen "represents the most sophisticated interpretation of the so-called "Buddha nature" tradition within the context of Indo-Tibetan thought".&lt;ref&gt;Germano, David Francis (1992). [https://web.archive.org/web/20120301185505/http://vajrayana.faithweb.com/Poetic%20thought%20-%20The%20Tantric%20synthesis%20of%20Dzogs%20Chen.pdf ''Poetic thought, the intelligent Universe, and the mystery of self: The Tantric synthesis of'' rDzogs Chen ''in fourteenth century Tibet''], The University of Wisconsin, Madison. Doctoral thesis. pp.viii - ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th/20th-century Nyingma scholar, Shechen Gyaltsap Gyurme Pema Namgyal, sees the Buddha nature as ultimate truth,&lt;ref&gt;Rabjam, Shechen (2007). ''The Great Medicine: Steps in Meditation on the Enlightened Mind''. Boston: Shambhala: p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; nirvana, which is constituted of profundity, primordial peace and radiance:

{{quote|Buddha-nature is immaculate. It is profound, serene, unfabricated suchness, an uncompounded expanse of luminosity; nonarising, unceasing, primordial peace, spontaneously present nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;Rabjam, Shechen (2007). ''The Great Medicine: Steps in Meditation on the Enlightened Mind''. Boston: Shambhala: p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]] sees an identity between the Buddha-nature, [[Dharmadhatu|dharmadhātu]] (essence of all phenomena and the noumenon) and the [[Three Vajras]], saying:
{{quote|Dharmadhatu is adorned with dharmakaya, which is endowed with dharmadhatu wisdom. This is a brief but very profound statement, because "dharmadhatu" also refers to sugata-garbha or buddha nature. Buddha nature is all-encompassing ... This buddha nature is present just as the shining sun is present in the sky. It is indivisible from the three vajras [i.e. the Buddha's Body, Speech and Mind] of the awakened state, which do not perish or change.&lt;ref&gt;Urgyen Rinpoche, Tulku (1999). ''As It Is''. Hong Kong: Rangjung Yeshe Books: p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The Nyingma meditation masters, [[Palden Sherab|Khenchen Palden Sherab]] and Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal, emphasise that the essential nature of the mind (the Buddha-nature) is not a blankness, but is characterized by wonderful qualities and a non-conceptual perfection that is already present and complete, it's just obscured and we fail to recognize it.&lt;ref&gt;Sherab, Khenchen Palden and Dongyal, Khenpo Tsewang (2006). ''Opening to Our Primordial Nature''. New York: Snow Lion: pp. 3, 9, 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in the context of Nyingma, [[Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche|Dzogchen Ponlop]] expresses the view that there exists within vajrayana Buddhism the doctrine that we are already buddha: ‘... in the vajrayana, we are buddha ''right now'', in this very moment’&lt;ref&gt;Dzogchen Ponlop, Mind Beyond Death, Snow Lion publications, New York, 2006, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is legitimate to have ‘vajra pride’ in our buddha mind and the already present qualities of enlightenment with which it is replete:
{{quote|Vajra pride refers to our pride and confidence in the absolute nature of our mind as buddha: primordially, originally pure, awake and full of the qualities of enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Dzogchen Ponlop, ''Mind Beyond Death'', Snow Lion Publications, New York, 2006, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Kagyu====
According to Brunnholzl,&lt;blockquote&gt;Virtually all [[Kagyu]] masters hold the teaching on buddha nature to be of definitive meaning and deny that the tathagata heart is just sheer emptiness or a nonimplicative negation. Though the Kagyu approach has certain similarities with Dolpopa's view, it is generally less absolute than the latter's and shows several significant differences, such as not claiming that the buddha qualities exist in their full-blown form even in confused sentient beings and not making such an absolute distinction between the two realities as Dolpopa does (the exception is [[Jamgon Kongtrul|Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Taye]], who largely follows [[Taranatha]] and Dolpopa but at times blends their positions with the [[Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama|Third Karmapa's]] view).&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2014, page 68"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In Kagyu the view of the Third Karmapa is generally seen as the most authoritative. This is the view that buddha nature is "mind's luminous ultimate nature or nondual wisdom, which is the basis of everything in samsara and nirvana."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 72.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Thrangu Rinpoche]] sees the Buddha nature as the indivisible oneness of wisdom and emptiness:
{{quote|The union of wisdom and emptiness is the essence of Buddha-hood or what is called Buddha-nature (Skt. ''Tathagata-garbha'') because it contains the very seed, the potential of Buddhahood. It resides in each and every being and because of this essential nature, this heart nature, there is the possibility of reaching Buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;Thrangu Rinpoche, Khenchen. [http://www.simhas.org/teaching14.html ''Buddha Nature and Buddhahood: the Mahayana and Tantra Yana''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230142513/http://www.simhas.org/teaching14.html |date=December 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The Rimé movement===
The Rimé movement is an ecumenical movement in Tibet which started as an attempt to reconcile the various Tibetan schools in the 19th century. In contrast to the Gelugpa, which adheres to the ''rang stong'', "self-empty", or Prasaṅgika point of view,{{refn|Which states that all existences are empty of a "self-nature"}} the Rimé movement supports ''shen tong'' (''gzhan tong''), "other-empty", an essential nature which is "pure radiant non-dual consciousness".{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=107}} [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] says about the two systems:{{quote|Madhyamika philosophies have no differences in realising as 'Shunyata', all phenomena that we experience on a relative level. They have no differences also, in reaching the meditative state where all extremes (ideas) completely dissolve. Their difference lies in the words they use to describe the [[Dharmata]]. Shentong describes the Dharmata, the mind of Buddha, as 'ultimately real'; while Rangtong philosophers fear that if it is described that way, people might understand it as the concept of 'soul' or 'Atma'. The Shentong philosopher believes that there is a more serious possibility of misunderstanding in describing the Enlightened State as 'unreal' and 'void'. Kongtrul finds the Rangtong way of presentation the best to dissolve concepts and the Shentong way the best to describe the experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/A%20-%20Tibetan%20Buddhism/Authors/Ringu%20Tulku/The%20Rime%20Movement/THE%20RIME%20(%20Ris-med%20)%20MOVEMENT.htm Ringu Tulku: The Rimé (Ris-med) movement of Jamgon Kongtrul the Great]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Modern scholarship==
Modern scholarship points to the various possible interpretations of Buddha Nature as either an essential self, as [[Sunyata]], or as the ''inherent possibility'' of awakening.

===Essential self===
Shenpen Hookham, Oxford Buddhist scholar and Tibetan lama of the Shentong tradition writes of the Buddha-nature or "true self" as something real and permanent, and already present within the being as uncompounded enlightenment. She calls it "the Buddha within", and comments:
{{quote|In scriptural terms, there can be no real objection to referring to Buddha, Buddhajnana [Buddha Awareness/ Buddha Knowledge], Nirvana and so forth as the True Self, unless the concept of Buddha and so forth being propounded can be shown to be impermanent, suffering, compounded, or imperfect in some way ... in Shentong terms, the non-self is about what is ''not'' the case, and the Self of the Third Dharmachakra [i.e. the Buddha-nature doctrine] is about what truly IS.&lt;ref&gt;Hookham, Shenpen (1991). ''The Buddha Within''. State University of New York Press: p.&amp;nbsp;104, p.&amp;nbsp;353&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Buddhist scholar and chronicler, Merv Fowler, writes that the Buddha-nature really is present as an essence within each being. Fowler comments:
{{quote|The teaching that Buddha-nature is the hidden essence within all sentient beings is the main message of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, the earliest of which is the ''Tathagatagarbha Sutra''. This short sutra says that all living beings are in essence identical to the Buddha regardless of their defilements or their continuing transmigration from life to life... As in the earlier traditions, there is present the idea that enlightenment, or nirvana, is not something which has to be achieved, it is something which is already there... In a way, it means that everyone is really a Buddha ''now''.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Merv (1999). ''Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices''. Sussex Academic Press: pp.&amp;nbsp;100–101&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sunyata===
According to Heng-Ching Shih, the ''tathāgatagarbha''/Buddha-nature does not represent a substantial self (''ātman''). Rather, it is a positive language expression of emptiness (''śūnyatā''), which emphasizes the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. The intention of the teaching of ''tathāgatagarbha''/Buddha nature is soteriological rather than theoretical.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

[[Paul Williams (British professor)|Paul Williams]] puts forward the Madhyamaka interpretation of the Buddha-nature as emptiness in the following terms:
{{quote|… if one is a Madhyamika then that which enables sentient beings to become buddhas must be the very factor that enables the minds of sentient beings to change into the minds of Buddhas. That which enables things to change is their simple absence of inherent existence, their emptiness. Thus the tathagatagarbha becomes emptiness itself, but specifically emptiness when applied to the mental continuum.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=164-165}}}}

===Critical Buddhist interpretation===
Several contemporary Japanese Buddhist scholars, headed under the label [[Critical Buddhism]] (''hihan bukky''ō, 批仏教), have been critical of Buddha-nature thought. According to Matsumoto Shiro and Hakamaya Noriaki of [[Komazawa University]], essentialist conceptions of Buddha-nature are at odds with the fundamental Buddhist doctrine of [[dependent origination]] and non-self ([[Anatta|''anātman'']]'')''.&lt;ref&gt;Matsumoto Shirõ (1997). ''The Doctrine of Tathagata-garbha Is Not Buddhist. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hakamaya Noriaki (1997). ''Critical Philosophy Versus Topical Philosophy'', in: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha nature doctrines which they label as ''dhātuvāda'' (“substantialism,”sometimes rendered “locus theory” or “topicalism”) and “generative monism” is not Buddhism at all.&lt;ref&gt;Sharf, Robert H. Buddha-nature, Critical Buddhism,and Early Chan, 불교학리뷰 (Critical Review for Buddhist Studies) 22권 (2017. 12) 105p~150p.&lt;/ref&gt; As defined by Matsumoto, this "locus" theory or ''dhātuvāda'' which he rejects as un-buddhist is:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the theory that the single (''eka, sama'') existent “locus” (''dhatu'') or basis is the cause that produces the manifold phenomena or “super-loci” (''dharmah'').&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Shiro Matsumoto, Critiques of Tathagatagarbha Thought and Critical Buddhism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Matsumoto further argues that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Tathagatagarbha thought was a Buddhist version of [[Advaita Vedanta|Hindu monism]], formed by the influence of [[Hinduism]] gradually introduced into Buddhism, especially after the rise of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other Japanese scholars responded to this view leading to a lively debate in Japan. Takasaki Jikido, a well known authority on ''tathagathagarbha'' thought, accepted that Buddha nature theories are similar to Upanishadic theories and that ''dhātuvāda'' is an accurate expression of the structure of these doctrines'','' but argues that the Buddha nature texts are aware of this and that Buddha nature is not necessarily un-Buddhist or anti-Buddhist.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Swanson, Paul L. Why They Say Zen is Not Buddhism: Recent Japanese Critiques of Buddha-Nature. http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/CriticalZen/What_and_why_of_Critical_Buddhism_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Likewise, Hirakawa Akira, sees Buddha nature as the potential to attain Buddhahood which not static but ever changing and argues that "''dhātu''" does not necessarily mean substratum (he points to some [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]] which identify ''dhatu'' with [[Pratītyasamutpāda|''pratitya-samutpada'']]).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Western scholars have reacted in different ways to this idea. Sallie B. King objects to their view, seeing the Buddha-nature as a metaphor for the potential in all beings to attain Buddhahood, rather than as an ontological reality.&lt;ref name="nanzan-u.ac.jp2"&gt;Sallie B. King (1997), ''The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist''. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997, pp. 174-179. {{ISBN|0824819497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert H. Sharf notes that the worries of the Critical Buddhists is nothing new, for "the early ''tathāgatagarbha'' scriptures betray a similar anxiety, as they tacitly acknowledge that the doctrine is close to, if not identical with, the heretical ātmavāda teachings of the non- Buddhists."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Sharf, Robert H. Buddha-nature, Critical Buddhism,and Early Chan, 불교학리뷰 (Critical Review for Buddhist Studies) 22권 (2017. 12) 105p~150p. http://www.academia.edu/27749171/Buddha-nature_Critical_Buddhism_and_Early_Chan&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes how the [[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra|''Nirvāṇa-sūtra'']] "tacitly concedes the non-Buddhist roots of the ''tathāgatagarbha'' idea."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Sharf also has pointed out how certain Southern Chan masters were concerned with other interpretations of Buddha nature, showing how the tendency to critique certain views of Buddha nature is not new in East Asian Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Peter N. Gregory has also argued that at least some East Asian interpretations of Buddha nature are equivalent to what Critical Buddhists call ''dhātuvāda,'' especially the work of [[Guifeng Zongmi|Tsung-mi]], who "emphasizes the underlying ontological ground on which all phenomenal appearances (''hsiang'') are based, which he variously refers to as the nature (''hsing''), the one mind (''i-hsin'')...".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Peter N. Is Critical Buddhism Really Critical? in ''Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism'' https://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/CriticalZen/Critical_Buddhism_Gregory.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dan Lusthaus]], certain [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist]] ideologies which became dominant in the 8th century promoted the idea of an "underlying metaphysical substratum" or "underlying, invariant, universal metaphysical 'source'" and thus do seem to be a kind of ''dhātuvāda.'' According to Lusthaus "in early T’ang China (7th–8th century) there was a deliberate attempt to divorce Chinese Buddhism from developments in India." Lusthaus notes that the Huayen thinker [[Fazang|Fa-tsang]] was influential in this theological trend who promoted the idea that true Buddhism was about comprehending the "One Mind that alone is the ground of reality" (''wei- hsin).''&lt;ref&gt;Lusthaus, Dan, Critical Buddhism and Returning to the Sources&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Williams too has criticised this view, saying that Critical Buddhism is too narrow in its definition of what constitutes Buddhism. According to Williams, "We should abandon any simplistic identification of Buddhism with a straightforward not-Self definition".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism'', Routledge, London, 2nd Edition, 2009, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple meanings===
Sutton agrees with Williams' critique on the narrowness of any single interpretation. In discussing the inadequacy of modern scholarship on Buddha-nature, Sutton states, 
{{quote|One is impressed by the fact that these authors, as a rule, tend to opt for a single meaning disregarding all other possible meanings which are embraced in turn by other texts".&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Florin Giripescu (1991).

He goes on to point out that the term ''tathāgatagarbha'' has up to six possible connotations. Of these, he says the three most important are:
#an underlying ontological reality or essential nature (''tathāgata-tathatā-'vyatireka'') which is functionally equivalent to a ''self'' (''ātman'') in an ''[[Upanishad]]ic'' sense,
#the ''dharma-kāya'' which penetrates all beings (''sarva-sattveṣu dharma-kāya-parispharaṇa''), which is functionally equivalent to [[brahman]] in an ''Upanishadic'' sense
#the womb or matrix of Buddhahood existing in all beings ''(tathāgata-gotra-saṃbhava''), which provides beings with the possibility of awakening.&lt;ref&gt;Takasaki, Jikido (1991). ''A Study on the Ratnagotravibhāga''. ISMEO 1966: p.198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Florin Giripescu Sutton, ''Existence and Enlightenment in the Laṅkāvatāra-sūtra'', SUNY({{ISBN|0-7914-0172-3}}): p.53&lt;/ref&gt;
Of these three, Sutton claims that only the third connotation has any soteriological significance, while the other two posit Buddha-nature as an ontological reality and essential nature behind all phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex (1981).

'''Caodong school''' ({{zh|c=曹洞宗 |p=Cáodòng zōng |w=Ts'ao-tung-tsung}}) is a [[Chinese Chan]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] sect, one of the [[Five Houses of Chán]].

==Etymology==
Some attribute the name "Cáodòng" as a union of "Dongshan" and "Caoshan" from one of his Dharma-heirs, [[Caoshan Benji]];&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fo.ifeng.com/changshi/200906/0603_22_56306.shtml|title=Origin of Caodong School|publisher=[[ifeng.com]]|date=June 3, 2009| accessdate=August 9, 2012|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the "Cao" much more likely came from ''Cáoxī'' (曹溪), the "mountain-name" of [[Huineng]], the Sixth Ancestor of Chan, as Caoshan was of little importance unlike his contemporary and fellow Dharma-heir, [[Yunju Daoying]]. The school emphasised [[sitting meditation (Zen)|sitting meditation]], and later "[[Shikantaza|silent illumination]]" techniques.

==History==
The Caodong school was founded by [[Dongshan Liangjie]] (807-869) and his Dharma-heir Caoshan Benji (840-901)
(Ts'ao-shan Pen-chi, Jpn. Sōzan Honjaku). Dongshan traced back his lineage to [[Shitou Xiqian]] (700-790), a contemporary of [[Mazu Daoyi]] (709–788). Sayings to the effect that Shitou and Mazu were the two great masters of their day date from decades after their respective deaths. Shítóu's retrospective prominence owes much to the importance of [[Dongshan Liangjie]].{{sfn|Poceski| 2007|p=97–98}} Shítóu does not appear to have been influential or famous during his lifetime: 
{{quote|He was a little-known teacher who led a reclusive life and had relatively few disciples. For decades after Shitou's death, his lineage remained an obscure provincial tradition.{{sfn|Poceski|2007}}}}

In the 11th century the Caodong-school nearly extinguished.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=79}} [[Dayang Jingxuan]] (942-1027), the last descendant of the Caodong-lineage passed on his dharma-transmission via Fushan Fayuan, a teacher from the [[Linji school]], to Fayuan's student [[Touzi Yiqing]] (1032-1083),{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=80}} who was born five years after Jingxuan's death.

During the [[Northern Song]] (960-1127) the Caodong was not successful in the social elite. The [[Linji school]] and [[Yunmen school]] dominated Chán.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=79}} It was Touzi Yiqing's student [[Furong Daokai]] (1043-1118) who was a successful monastic, and revived the Caodong school.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=79-81}}

His dharma "grandson" [[Hongzhi Zhengjue]] (1091-1157) became very successful among elite literati in the [[Southern Song]] (1127-1279), when the Imperial Court decreased their influence on society, and Chán schools became dependent on elite literati for support. This success drew opposition of [[Dahui Zonggao]], who promoted the [[Hua Tou]] method of [[Koan|koan-study]] as an accessible means for Chán-practice, and attacked the [[Shikantaza|silent illumination]] of Hongzhi.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008}}

In 1227 [[Dōgen Zenji]], a former [[Tendai]] student, studied Caodong Buddhism under [[Tiantong Rujing]], and returned to [[Japan]] to establish the [[Sōtō]] sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://read.goodweb.cn/news/news_view.asp?newsid=44543|script-title=zh:道元和日本曹洞宗|publisher=|accessdate= |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lineage incorporates not only the dharma-transmission via Fushan Fayuan, but also Linji dharma-transmissions via [[Eisai]] and his student Myozen, a teacher of Dogen, and the Linji dharma-transmission of Dahui Zonggao via the [[Nōnin|Nōnin school]].{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=428}}

==Lineage chart==
via Shitou the Caodong traces back its origins to Huineng.

The '''Church of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God''' is a predominantly [[African American]]  [[Pentecostal]] [[holiness movement|holiness]] [[spirituality|spiritual]] church. It began as a breakaway congregation of the Detroit branch of the southern based, nationwide Triumph the Church and Kingdom of God in Christ in the 1940s. It was founded by [[James F. Jones (minister)|James F. Jones]], often known as Prophet Jones.

Universal Triumph, Dominion of God positions itself theologically as the 'fulfillment' of and the true successor to 'the mission' of its former Mother Church. Its self-designation is not as a [[Christian]] 'Holiness' [[church (building)|Church]] but as a Christian 'Holiness' Kingdom or a literal 'Dominion of God' into which members, known as '[[citizens]]', have to 'register' not 'join'.

Once registered into the Dominion, citizens are admonished to strictly abide by the 'Dominion rules', i.e. no smoking, alcoholic drinks, coffee, tea, drugs or games of any kind as specified in the 'Dominion constitution' as set up by the 'Dominion Ruler'. The Dominion Ruler is the Head of the Dominion or Kingdom.

==Objectives and purposes==
The Dominion was founded, it states, by direct message to its founder by God to disseminate the "whole truth of God throughout the world". Thus divine messages of guidance and revelation through the Dominion founder are the underscoring foundation of Universal Triumph Dominion of God. Its sacred text is the Christian [[Bible]].

Dominion publications that interpret and explain the Bible in light of the [[divine revelation]]s of the Dominion founder, Prophet Jones, are 'The Mind Awakener' and 'The Message'. The procedure to properly conduct weekly Dominion services are in 'The ritual'. Further instructions for citizens and auxiliaries and other components that make up the Dominion of God are in 'The Dominion Constitution'. The Dominion consists of numerous 'churches' called "Thankful Centers" around the United States and abroad.

==Hierarchy==
The Dominion is led by the Dominion Ruler. The founding Dominion Ruler, James F. Jones, is known to the citizens of the Dominion of God as 'God's only Holy Prophet'. The Dominion Ruler is assisted in his duties by The First Dominion Lady and the Dominion Chief Secretary known as the Universal Dominion Executor. The Universal Dominion Executor presides over the Diocean Administers. The Diocean Administers preside over the various districts, or Diocese, that compose the Dominion. Several Thankful Centers make up a Dominion district. The local Thankful Center is led by a Dominion minister called the Local Administrator. The Local Administrator oversees weekly Dominion services as well as the local activities of the Dominion auxiliary clubs.

==General Assembly==
An annual international Dominion conference called the 'General Assembly' is convened by the Dominion hierarchy, the [[board of directors]] and the [[board of trustees]] of the Dominion, to oversee the world activities of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God. The activities and duties of the General Assembly when convened are to review the efforts of the Dominion workers to establish Thankful Centers, Dominion schools and seminaries throughout the world, to ordain and appoint missionaries and evangelists to head up the work and to appoint and ordain all dignitaries and officials of the Dominion under the direct direction and leadership of the Universal Dominion Ruler.

==Clergy and auxiliary leaders==
The Dominion clergy, workers and auxiliary leaders make up the dignitaries and officials of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God. Both men and women citizens in the Dominion are eligible to serve as auxiliary club and/or laity leaders as well as members of the clergy. Leaders in the work of the Dominion earn and are given [[royal titles]] such as sir, prince, princess, lord, and lady by designation from the Dominion Ruler.

==Dominion auxiliary clubs==
The auxiliary clubs of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God are the Universal Missionary Society, the Universal Praise Bands, the Universal Rescue Workers and the Universal Young Peoples Union. The Universal Missionary Society's duties include establishing thankful centers, Universal Triumph, Dominion of God schools and seminaries throughout the world. The Universal Rescue Workers Union's duties are "to provide for the widows and orphans, the poor and the needy". The Universal Young Peoples Union is the youth auxiliary of the Dominion.

==Founding prophet, teachings and celebrations==
[[File:Prophet Jones LIFE Nov 1944.jpg|thumb|Prophet Jones preaching in November 1944]]
The Dominion was organized and founded in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] between 1938 and its formation in 1944 by a former Pastor &amp; missionary for Triumph the Church and Kingdom of God in Christ, [[James F. Jones (minister)|James F. Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simmons|first=Zena|title=Detroit's Flamboyant Prophet Jones|url=http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=182|publisher=Detroit News|accessdate=13 January 2012|date=13 September 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/ear_01/ear_01_00072.html |title=Black Holiness |publisher=Novelguide |date=2002-03-19 |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones, known as "Prophet Jones", claimed to be a [[faith healing]] minister, and ran a [[fundamentalist]] [[Christian]], radio and television ministry. Jones further claimed that he was the [[second coming of Christ]] with the divine power to heal, forecast, bless and curse.

Jones, as Dominion founder, was the Dominion Ruler from 1944 till his death in 1971. His successor as Dominion Ruler was [[James Schaffer (pastor)|James Schaffer]].

The Universal Triumph Dominion of God's teachings revolve around heralding the incoming [[millennialism|millennial]] rule of 'perfect bliss' under the 'universal triumph' of the 'kingdom of God', in which the wicked, and death itself, will be destroyed but the Dominion faithful will live forever in incorruptible physical bodies right here on Earth. Those in the Dominion that are faithful now, it teaches, can and do have heaven right here on earth by recognizing the 'divine' calling of the Dominion ruler and by strictly obeying his 'divine' wisdom and rules. When this stage of understanding is adhered too the Dominion declares "All Is well": which is the Dominion's signature phrase.

The Dominion of God holds its founder and first Dominion Ruler, Jones, in the highest esteem. It annually celebrates the week of his birth, beginning November 24, his birthday, called Philamethyu and ending December 1, called Hushdomcalama. For the Dominion this is the sacred time of the year and the celebrations take the place of Christmas as practiced in much of Christianity.

==Dominion rulers==

The Dominion Ruler in the Church of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God is the head [[religious leader]], [[pastor]], and [[wikt:overseer|overseer]] of the church and movement. The Dominion Ruler (the Head of the Dominion, or colloquially, the Kingdom) is understood by the Dominion citizens to be the Universal Divine Ruler similar to a [[divine king]] who is in direct contact with God.

===Duties===
The Dominion Ruler serves as top leader, chief teacher, top trustee and final judge as the 'divine ruler' in the Church of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God. He oversees the international Dominion conference called the General Assembly convened by the Dominion hierarchy, the [[board of directors]] and the [[board of trustees]]. He also awards high-level and active leaders in the Dominion  with [[royal titles]] such as sir, prince, princess, lord and lady.

===Honorary titles===
*[[His Holiness]]
*[[The Right Reverend]]
*[[Reverend]] [[Lord]], ''Lord'' comes from how ''Prophet Jones''  blessed his inner circle with royal and noble titles, such as "Sir," "Prince" and "Princess," "Lord" and "Lady" and other majestic appellations.

'''Dayang Jingxuan''' ({{zh|t=大陽警玄|s=大阳警玄}}; {{CJKV|j=Taiyo Keigen}}) was a [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] monk during the early [[Song Dynasty]]. During his life, he was apparently the only living teacher representing [[Caodong]]/[[Sōtō]] school, and he was the last monk of that tradition to be mentioned in the influential ''[[Transmission of the Lamp]]'', compiled in 1004. However, as that work was compiled during his lifetime, it lacked biographical information. A biography did not appear until the ''Xudeng lu'' of 1101.&lt;ref name=Fer&gt;{{citation|last=Ferguson|first=Andrew E.|title=Zen's Chinese heritage: the masters and their teachings|year=2000|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-163-5|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sch&gt;{{citation|last=Schlütter|first=Morten|title=How Zen Became Zen: The Dispute Over Enlightenment and the Formation of Chan Buddhism in Song-Dynasty China|year=2010|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-3508-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79, 80, 91}} He left his birth city to become a monk at Chongxiao Temple in [[Nanjing|Jinling]]. His teacher there was named Zhitong, but Dayang soon left when he was 19. He studied with Yuanjiao Liaoyi for a time, but eventually moved on, finally settling on [[Liangshan Yuanguan]] as his teacher.&lt;ref name=Fer/&gt;

Dayang Jingxuan is an important figure in the [[Caodong]]/[[Sōtō]] Zen lineage because he was apparently the only remaining representative of the [[Caodong]]/[[Sōtō]] tradition during his lifetime. Furthermore, he is significant because the lineage effectively died out with him, but through highly unusual means, the lineage was passed on to someone he had never met. Juefan Huihong's biographical compilation of 1119, the ''Chanlin sengbao zhuan'' (Chronicle of the Sangha Treasure in the Groves of Chan), suggests that [[Touzi Yiqing]] was the "true son", or student, of Dayang. The ''Xudeng lu'' of 1101 lists Touzi and nine others as disciples of Dayang. However, it explains that Touzi did not actually receive [[dharma transmission]] from Dayang, but from [[Fushan Fayuan]]. Fushan had been a student of Dayang, but he himself had not received dharma transmission from Dayang either. The scholar Morten Schlütter notes that this form of lineage transfer "has no real parallel in early Chan literature". This refers to the fact that Touzi was able to be considered the immediate heir to Dayang's lineage without having met him, and that Fayuan was able to hold Dayang's lineage "in trust" without actually being a bona fide heir. Schlütter further interprets Huihong's likely embellished account as an attempt to strengthen the rather weak link between Touzi and the last Caodong monk recorded in the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp]]'' in order to solidify the legitimacy of the lineage.&lt;ref name=sch/&gt;{{rp|93–94,210}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18741">'''Devolution''', '''de-evolution''', or '''backward evolution''' is the notion that [[species]] can revert to supposedly more [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]] forms over time. The concept is related to the idea that [[evolution]] has [[teleology|a purpose (teleology)]] and [[orthogenesis|is progressive (orthogenesis)]], for example that feet might be better than [[hoof|hooves]] or [[lung]]s than [[gill]]s. However, [[evolutionary biology]] makes no such assumptions, and [[natural selection]] shapes [[adaptation]]s with no foreknowledge of any kind. It is possible for small changes such as in the frequency of a single gene to be reversed by chance or selection, but this is no different from the normal course of evolution.

In the 19th century, when belief in orthogenesis was widespread, the idea of devolution was advocated by zoologists such as [[Ray Lankester]] and [[Anton Dohrn]],  and the palaeontologists [[Alpheus Hyatt]] and [[Carl H. Eigenmann]]. The idea was used in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s 1985 novel ''[[Galápagos (novel)|Galápagos]]'', where he portrays a society that has evolved backwards to have small brains.

[[Dollo's law of irreversibility]], first stated in 1893 by the palaeontologist [[Louis Dollo]], denies the possibility of devolution. The evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] explains Dollo's law as being simply a statement about the [[probability|improbability]] of evolution's following precisely the same path twice.

==Context==
[[File:Lamarck's Two-Factor Theory.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Lamarck's theory of evolution involved a complexifying force that [[orthogenesis|progressively]] drives animal [[body plan]]s towards higher levels, creating a ladder of [[phylum|phyla]], as well as an adaptive force that causes animals with a given body plan to [[inheritance of acquired characteristics|adapt to circumstances]]. The idea of progress in such theories permits the opposite idea of decay, seen in devolution.]]
{{see|Orthogenesis}}

The idea of devolution is based on the presumption of [[orthogenesis]], the view that [[evolution]] has a [[teleology|purposeful]] direction towards [[Evolution of biological complexity|increasing complexity]]. Modern evolutionary theory, beginning with Darwin at least, poses no such presumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McShea D |title=Complexity and evolution: What everybody knows |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=303–324 |year=1991 |doi=10.1007/BF00132234}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the concept of evolutionary change is independent of either any increase in complexity of organisms sharing a gene pool, or any decrease, such as in [[vestigiality]] or in loss of genes.&lt;ref name=sciam&gt;Dougherty, Michael J. [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=is-the-human-race-evolvin Is the human race evolving or devolving?] ''[[Scientific American]]'' July 20, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier views that species are subject to "cultural decay", "drives to perfection", or "devolution" are practically meaningless in terms of current (neo-)Darwinian theory.&lt;ref name=Glossary&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/precursors/glossary.html |title=Darwin's precursors and influences: Glossary |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early scientific theories of [[transmutation of species]] such as [[Lamarckism]] perceived species diversity as a result of a purposeful internal drive or tendency to form improved adaptations to the environment. In contrast, Darwinian evolution and its elaboration in the light of subsequent advances in biological research, have shown that [[adaptation]] through [[natural selection]] comes about when particular heritable attributes in a population happen to give a better chance of successful reproduction in the reigning environment than rival attributes do. By the same process less advantageous attributes are less "successful"; they decrease in frequency or are lost completely. Since Darwin's time it has been shown how these changes in the frequencies of attributes occur according to the mechanisms of [[genetics]] and the laws of inheritance originally investigated by [[Gregor Mendel]].  Combined with Darwin's original insights, genetic advances led to what has variously been called the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]&lt;ref name="Huxley1974"&gt;{{cite book |author=Huxley, Julian |authorlink=Julian Huxley |title=Evolution: the modern synthesis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sIkoAQAAMAAJ |year=1974 |publisher=Allen and Unwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the neo-Darwinism of the 20th century. In these terms evolutionary adaptation may occur most obviously through the natural selection of particular [[allele]]s. Such alleles may be long established, or they may be new [[mutation]]s. Selection also might arise from more complex [[epigenetic]] or other [[Chromosome|chromosomal]] changes, but the fundamental requirement is that any adaptive effect must be [[heritable]].&lt;ref name="Koonin2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Koonin, Eugene V. |title=The Logic of Chance: The Nature and Origin of Biological Evolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvmv2kU6PrYC&amp;pg=PA16 |date=23 June 2011 |publisher=FT Press |isbn=978-0-13-262317-9 |pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of devolution on the other hand, requires that there be a preferred hierarchy of structure and function, and that evolution must mean "progress" to "more advanced" organisms. For example, it could be said that "feet are better than [[hoof|hooves]]" or "[[lung]]s are better than [[gill]]s", so their development is "evolutionary" whereas change to an inferior or "less advanced" structure would be called "devolution". In reality an evolutionary biologist defines all heritable changes to relative frequencies of the genes or indeed to [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] states in the gene pool as evolution.&lt;ref name="Futuyma2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Futuyma, Douglas |title=Evolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkrRlwEACAAJ |date=31 March 2013 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=978-1-60535-115-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; All gene pool changes that lead to increased fitness in terms of appropriate aspects of reproduction are seen as (neo-)Darwinian adaptation because, for the organisms possessing the changed structures, each is a useful adaptation to their circumstances. For example, hooves have advantages for running quickly on plains, which benefits horses, and feet offer advantages in climbing trees, which some ancestors of humans did.&lt;ref name=sciam/&gt;

The concept of devolution as regress from progress relates to the ancient ideas that either life came into being through special creation or that humans are the ultimate product or goal of evolution. The latter belief is related to [[anthropocentrism]], the idea that human existence is the point of all universal existence. Such thinking can lead on to the idea that species evolve because they "need to" in order to adapt to environmental changes. Biologists refer to this misconception as [[teleology]], the idea of [[intrinsic finality]] that things are "supposed" to be and behave a certain way, and naturally tend to act that way to pursue their own good. From a biological viewpoint, in contrast, if species evolve it is not a reaction to necessity, but rather that the population contains variations with traits that favour their [[natural selection]]. This view is supported by the fossil record which demonstrates that roughly ninety-nine percent of all species that ever lived are now extinct.&lt;ref name=sciam/&gt;

People thinking in terms of devolution commonly assume that progress is shown by increasing complexity, but biologists studying the [[evolution of complexity]] find evidence of many examples of decreasing complexity in the record of evolution. The lower jaw in fish, reptiles and mammals has seen a decrease in complexity, if measured by the number of bones. Ancestors of modern horses had several toes on each foot; modern horses have a single hooved toe. Modern humans may be evolving towards never having [[wisdom teeth]], and already have lost most of the [[Human vestigiality#Coccyx|tail]] found in many other mammals - not to mention other [[vestigial]] structures, such as the [[vermiform appendix]] or the [[nictitating membrane]].&lt;ref name=sciam/&gt; In some cases, the [[:de:Organisationsstufe|level of organization]] of living creatures can also “shift” downwards (e.g., the [[multicellularity#Evolutionary history|loss of multicellularity]] in some groups of protists and fungi).&lt;ref&gt;Seravin L. N. (2001) The principle of counter-directional morphological evolution and its significance for constructing the megasystem of protists and other eukaryotes. ''Protistology'' 2: 6-14, [http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/the-principle-of-counter-directional-morphological-evolution-and-its-significance-for-construction-the-megasystem-of-protists-and-other].&lt;/ref&gt;

A more rational version of the concept of devolution, a version that does not involve concepts of "primitive" or "advanced" organisms, is based on the observation that if certain genetic changes in a particular combination (sometimes in a particular sequence as well) are precisely reversed, one should get precise reversal of the evolutionary process, yielding an [[atavism]] or "throwback", whether more or less complex than the ancestors where the process began.&lt;ref&gt;Medawar, P. B., Medawar, J. S.; Aristotle to Zoos: A Philosophical Dictionary of Biology; Harvard University Press 1985, {{ISBN|978-0-674-04537-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a trivial level, where just one or a few mutations are involved, selection pressure in one direction can have one effect, which can be reversed by new patterns of selection when conditions change. That could be seen as reversed evolution, though the concept is not of much interest because it does not differ in any functional or effective way from any other adaptation to selection pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Majerus, Michael E. N. (ed:Fellowes, M, et al.); The Peppered Moth: Decline of a Darwinian Disciple; Insect Evolutionary Ecology (Royal Entomological Society) CABI 2005  {{ISBN|978-0-85199-812-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the number of genetic changes rises however, one combinatorial effect is that it becomes vanishingly unlikely that the full course of adaptation can be reversed precisely. Also, if one of the original adaptations involved complete loss of a gene, one can neglect any probability of reversal. Accordingly, one might well expect reversal of peppered moth colour changes, but not reversal of the loss of limbs in snakes.

==History==
[[File:Bénédict Augustin Morel (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bénédict Morel]] (1809–1873) suggested a link between the environment and [[social degeneration]].]]
{{see|Degeneration theory}}

The concept of degenerative evolution was used by scientists in the 19th century, at this time it was believed by most [[biologists]] that evolution had some kind of direction.

In 1857 the physician [[Bénédict Morel]] influenced by [[Lamarckism]] claimed that environmental factors such as taking [[drugs]] or [[alcohol]] would produce [[social degeneration]] in the offspring of those individuals, and would revert those [[offspring]] to a primitive state.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, James Richard. History, Humanity and Evolution: Essays for John C. Greene, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; Morel, a devout [[Catholic]], had believed that mankind had started in perfection, contrasting modern humanity to the past, Morel claimed there had been "Morbid deviation from an original type".&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Daniel. Renovating Russia: the human sciences and the fate of liberal modernity, 1880-1930, 2008, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; His theory of devolution was later advocated by some biologists.

According to Roger Luckhurst:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Darwin soothed readers that evolution was progressive, and directed towards human perfectibility. The next generation of biologists were less confident or consoling. Using Darwin's theory, and many rival biological accounts of development then in circulation, scientists suspected that it was just as possible to ''devolve'', to slip back down the evolutionary scale to prior states of development.&lt;ref&gt;Luckhurst, Roger. Late Victorian Gothic tales, 2005, p. 20 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CpTCyV4uD4IC&amp;pg=PR20&amp;dq=Ray+Lankester+devolution&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dLWdTsq6LYuhOoO6uecE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ray%20Lankester%20devolution&amp;f=false Link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the first biologists to suggest devolution was [[Ray Lankester]], he explored the possibility that evolution by [[natural selection]] may in some cases lead to devolution, an example he studied was the regressions in the life cycle of [[sea squirts]]. Lankester discussed the idea of devolution in his book ''Degeneration: A Chapter in Darwinism'' (1880). He was a critic of progressive evolution, pointing out that higher forms existed in the past which have since degenerated into simpler forms. Lankester argued that "if it was possible to evolve, it was also possible to devolve, and that complex organisms could devolve into simpler forms or animals".&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Gregory; Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm. Darwin's Screens: Evolutionary Aesthetics, Time and Sexual Display in the Cinema By Barbara Creed, 2009, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, biology, and metaphor, 2002, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anton Dohrn]] also developed a theory of degenerative evolution based on his studies of [[vertebrates]]. According to Dohrn many [[chordates]] are degenerated because of their environmental conditions. Dohrn claimed [[cyclostomes]] such as [[lampreys]] are degenerate fish as there is no evidence their jawless state is an ancestral feature but is the product of environmental adaptation due to [[parasitism]]. According to Dohrn if cyclotomes would devolve further then they would resemble something like an [[Amphioxus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, Peter J. Life's splendid drama: evolutionary biology and the reconstruction of life's ancestry 1860-1940, 1996, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian of biology [[Peter J. Bowler]] has written that devolution was taken seriously by proponents of [[orthogenesis]] and others in the late 19th century who at this period of time firmly believed that there was a direction in evolution. [[Orthogenesis]] was the belief that evolution travels in internally directed trends and levels. The [[paleontologist]] [[Alpheus Hyatt]] discussed devolution in his work, using the concept of ''racial senility'' as the mechanism of devolution. Bowler defines ''racial senility'' as "an evolutionary retreat back to a state resembling that from which it began."&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Bowler|Bowler, Peter J.]] ''The eclipse of Darwinism: anti-Darwinian evolution theories in the decades around 1900'', 1992, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyatt who studied the [[fossils]] of [[invertebrates]] believed that up to a point [[ammonoids]] developed by regular stages up until a specific level but would later due to unfavourable conditions descend back to a previous level, this according to Hyatt was a form of lamarckism as the degeneration was a direct response to external factors. To Hyatt after the level of degeneration the species would then become extinct, according to Hyatt there was a "phase of youth, a phase of maturity, a phase of senility or degeneration foreshadowing the extinction of a type".&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, Peter J. ''Evolution: the history of an idea'', 1989, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information'', Volume 20, Hugh Chisholm, The Encyclopædia britannica company, 1911, p. 590&lt;/ref&gt; To Hyatt the devolution was predetermined by internal factors which organisms can neither control or reverse. This idea of all evolutionary branches eventually running out of energy and degenerating into [[extinction]] was a pessimistic view of [[evolution]] and was unpopular amongst many scientists of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, Peter J. Evolution: the history of an idea, 1989, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl H. Eigenmann]] an [[ichthyologist]] wrote ''Cave vertebrates of America: a study in degenerative evolution'' (1909) in which he concluded that [[cave]] [[evolution]] was essentially degenerative.&lt;ref&gt;Romero Diaz, Aldemaro. ''The biology of hypogean fishes'', 2001, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The [[entomologist]] [[William Morton Wheeler]]&lt;ref&gt;Lustig, Abigail; Richards, Robert John; Ruse, Michael. ''Darwinian heresies'', 2004, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lamarckian]] [[Ernest MacBride]] (1866–1940) also advocated degenerative evolution. According to Macbride [[invertebrate]]s were actually degenerate [[vertebrate]]s, his argument was based on the idea that "crawling on the seabed was inherently less stimulating than swimming in open waters."&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, Peter J. ''Life's splendid drama: evolutionary biology and the reconstruction of life's ancestry 1860-1940'', 1996, p. 432&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dollo's law==
{{Main|Dollo's law}}

Complex organs evolve in a lineage over many generations, and once lost they are unlikely to re-evolve.  This observation is sometimes generalized to a hypothesis known as ''Dollo's law'', which states that evolution is not reversible.  This does not mean that similar engineering solutions cannot be found by natural selection. For instance the tail of the [[cetacea]]—whales, dolphins and porpoises which are evolved from formerly land-dwelling mammals—is an adaptation of the spinal column for propulsion in water.  Unlike the tails of the mammal's marine ancestor, the [[Sarcopterygii]], and of the [[teleostei|teleosts]], which move from side to side, the cetacean's tail moves up and down as it flexes its mammalian spine, but the function of the tail in providing propulsion is remarkably similar.

{{Attributes of God}}

In [[theology]], '''divine providence''', or just '''providence''', is [[God]]'s intervention in the [[Universe]]. The term ''Divine Providence'' (usually capitalized) is also used as a [[names of God|title of God]]. A distinction is usually made between "general providence", which refers to God's [[God the Sustainer|continuous upholding]] of the existence and [[natural law|natural order]] of the Universe, and "special providence", which refers to God's extraordinary intervention in the life of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Providence.aspx#1O101-Providence |title=Providence |work=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions |publisher=[[Encyclopedia.com]] |date= |access-date=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miracle]]s generally fall in the latter category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Creation, Providence, and Miracle |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/creation-providence-and-miracle |publisher=[[Reasonable Faith]] |access-date=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word comes from Latin ''providentia'' "foresight, [[prudence]]", from ''pro-'' "ahead" and ''videre'' "to see". The current use of the word has the sense of "knowledge of the future" or [[omniscience]], understood as an [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attribute of God]].

==Catholic theology==
[[Augustine of Hippo]] is perhaps most famously associated with the doctrine of divine providence in the Latin West. Augustine held that since God's governance takes place in the universe comprising a vast multitude of relatively independent individuals differing in nature, function, and end, this implies the continuous control and unifying governance of a single supreme Being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm Walker, Leslie. "Divine Providence." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 19 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, Christian teaching on providence in the [[High Middle Ages]] was most fully developed by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. The concept of providence as care exercised by God over the [[universe]], his foresight and care for its future is extensively developed and explained both by Aquinas himself and modern [[Thomism|Thomists]]. One of the foremost modern Thomists, [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] father [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]], wrote a study of providence entitled "Providence: God's loving care for man and the need for confidence in Almighty God." In it, he presents and solves, according to Catholic doctrine, the most difficult issues as related to providence.

==Reformed theology==
{{See also|Reformed theology}}
This term is an integral part of [[John Calvin]]'s theological framework known as [[Calvinism]], which emphasizes the [[total depravity]] of man and the complete sovereignty of God. God's plan for the world and every soul that he has created is guided by his will, or providence. According to Calvin, the idea that man has [[free will]] and is able to make choices independently of what God has already determined is based on our limited understanding of God's perfection and the idea that God's purposes can be circumvented. In this mode of thought, providence is related to absolute free will. This concept remains prominent among many [[Protestant]] denominations that identify with Calvinism, the [[Reformed churches]].

==Lutheran theology==
{{See also|Lutheranism}}
In [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] theology, divine providence refers to God's preservation of [[ex nihilo|creation]], his cooperation with everything that happens, and his guiding of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, J.T., ''Christian Dogmatics''. Concordia Publishing House. 1934. pp. 189-195 and Fuerbringer, L., ''[https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' Concordia Publishing House. 1927. p. 635 and [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=P&amp;word=PROVIDENCE Christian Cyclopedia] article on Divine Providence.

God concurs with an act's effect, but he does not cooperate in the corruption of an act or the evil of its effect.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Steven P.,''Called to Believe, Teach, and Confess''. Wipf and Stock. 2005. pp. 122-123.&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans believe everything exists for the sake of the Christian Church, and that God guides everything for its welfare and growth.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, J.T., ''Christian Dogmatics''. Concordia Publishing House: 1934. pp. 190 and Edward. W. A.,''A Short Explanation of Dr. Martin Luther's Small Catechism''. Concordia Publishing House. 1946. p. 165. and [http://www.wlsessays.net/node/1122 Divine Providence and Human Adversity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707130929/http://www.wlsessays.net/node/1122 |date=2010-07-07 }} by Markus O. Koepsell&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Martin Luther]], divine providence began when God created the world with everything needed for human life, including both physical things and [[natural laws]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/luthersworksvolu009862mbp Luther's Works Vol. 1 Lectures on Genesis Chapters 1-5] page 25, 47&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Luther's Small Catechism]], the explanation of the first article of the [[Apostles' Creed]] declares that everything people have that is good is given and preserved by God, either directly or through other people or things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.com/smallcatechism.html#creed |title=Luther's Small Catechism, The Apostle's Creed |publisher=Bookofconcord.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the services others provide us through family, [[government]], and work, he writes, "we receive these blessings not from them, but, through them, from God."&lt;ref name="bookofconcord1"&gt;[http://www.bookofconcord.org/largecatechism/3_tencommandments.html Luther's Large Catechism, First Commandment]&lt;/ref&gt; Since God uses everyone's useful tasks for good, people should look not down upon some useful vocations as being less worthy than others. Instead people should honor others, no matter how lowly, as being the means God uses to work in the world.&lt;ref name="bookofconcord1"/&gt;

==Eastern Orthodox theology==
The doctrine of providence in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] is set out by St [[John of Tobolsk]]:
"St. John Damascene describes it thus: 'Providence is Divine will which maintains everything and wisely rules over everything' ... It was not by chance that the iniquitous Israeli King Ahab was struck by an arrow that flew in between the seams of his armor. Truly that arrow was directed by the hand of God, just as was the one which struck Julian the Apostate; only for the soldier who let fly the arrow was it accidental. It was not by chance that swallows flew into the home of Tobit and blinded the righteous man. This happened at God’s command, in order to hold Tobit up as an example to succeeding generations, as we learn from the Angel who accompanied his son Tobias. Nothing happens by chance. It was not by chance that Caesar Augustus ordered the census to be taken in the year of Christ’s Nativity. It was not by chance that Christ met with the Samaritan woman at the well in Sychar and spoke with her. All this was foreseen and written down in the books of Divine Providence before the beginning of time.”&lt;ref&gt;http://livingorthodoxfaith.blogspot.co.za/2009/11/divine-providence-by-st-john-of-tobolsk.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swedenborgian theology==
{{See also|The New Church}}
''Divine Providence'' is a book published by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] in 1764 which describes his [[systematic theology]] regarding providence, free will, [[theodicy]], and other related topics. Both meanings of providence are applicable in Swedenborg's theology, in that providence encompasses understanding, intent and action. Divine providence relative to man is 'foresight', and relative to the Lord is 'providence'.&lt;ref&gt;S. Warren, Compendium of Swedenborg's Theological Writings, page 480&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg proposes that one law of divine providence is that man should act from freedom according to reason, and that man is regenerated according to the faculties of rationality and liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. Divine Providence, note 71-73&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Jewish thought==
{{Main|Divine providence (Judaism)}}
Divine providence ({{lang-he-n|השגחה פרטית}} ''Hashgochoh Protis'' / ''Hashgachah Pratit'' lit. [Divine] supervision of the individual) is discussed throughout [[Rabbinic literature]], and in particular by the classical Jewish philosophers. These writings maintain that divine providence means that God is directing (or even recreating) every minute detail of creation. This analysis thus underpins much of [[Orthodox Judaism]]'s [[world view]], particularly as regards questions of interaction with the natural world.

==LDS theology==
There is little theological literature on the terms '''provenance''' or '''providence''' in LDS studies. As stated above, Reformed theology relates these terms to predestination, which does have more prominence in LDS theology, if only as a polemical term. 

One particular text that could be interpreted as being related to such terms is in the Book of Abraham. As Abraham is shown the heavens, he is also shown the pre-mortal spirits of mankind. &lt;blockquote&gt;And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng|title=Abraham 3|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The "making of rulers" above is explained as foreordination (in the chapter summary) as opposed to "predestination"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1990/12/i-have-a-question?lang=eng|title=I Have a Question - Ensign Dec. 1990 - ensign|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This differentiation balances free will (or free agency in LDS theology) against Divine intervenion. Noted LDS scholar Richard Draper has described the church's position thusly, "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints rejects the belief in predestination-that God predetermines the salvation or the damnation of every individual ... The LDS position is based in part on the teachings of Paul that God "will render to every man according to his deeds" and that "there is no respect of persons with God" (Rom. 2:6, 11). These two principles provide a basis for understanding Paul's use of the term "predestination." The term apparently connoted "to be ordained beforehand for godly labor." In the sense that one's potential or calling has been recognized and declared, this interpretation conforms with the Greek term Paul used, ''proorizo'', and does not denote an irreversible or irresistible predetermination."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Predestination|title=Predestination - The Encyclopedia of Mormonism|website=eom.byu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this does not imply a passive God. In fact, LDS theology favours a more active, interventionist God. In its more recent General Conferences of the church, Elder Ronald A. Rasband of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, clearly articulates this, "Our lives are like a chessboard, and the Lord moves us from one place to another"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/by-divine-design?lang=eng|title=By Divine Design - By Elder Ronald A. Rasband|last=Rasband|first=By Elder Ronald A.|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rasband continues by citing a well-known text from in the Book of Mormon&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4?lang=eng|title=1 Nephi 4|last=|first=|date=|website=www.lds.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in which Nephi finds his nemesis unconscious from inebriation in front of him, he concludes, "Was he fortunate to just happen upon Laban? Or was it by “divine design”?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although the text itself limits the interaction of the Divine to the "Spirit" to commanding Nephi to "Slay him."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is important to note, though, that God also limits his involvement. Rasband interprets one particular passage from the Book of Mormon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/4.24-25?lang=eng#23|title=Helaman 4|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as saying that God (through his Spirit) will only intervene based on righteousness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rasband concludes that, "When we are righteous, willing, and able, when we are striving to be worthy and qualified, we progress to places we never imagined and become part of Heavenly Father’s “divine design.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Specific examples==

===Text of Scripture===
Those who believe in the [[biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] of the original [[biblical manuscript]]s often accompany this belief with a statement about how the biblical text has been preserved so that what we have today is at least substantially similar to what was written. That is, just as God "divinely inspired the text," so he has also "divinely preserved it throughout the centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.quodlibet.net/weil-inerrancy.shtml |title=Inerrancy and its Implications for Authority: Textual Critical Considerations in Formulating an Evangelical Doctrine of Scripture |journal=[[Quodlibet (journal)|Quodlibet]] |volume=4 |issue=4 |date=November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] states that the Scriptures, "being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical."&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Confession of Faith]], I.viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an important argument in the [[King James Only movement|King James Only]] debates. [[Edward F. Hills]] argues that the principle of providentially preserved transmission guarantees that the printed [[Textus Receptus]] must be the closest text to the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[autograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward F. Hills]], ''King James Version Defended!'', pp. 199-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enver Halil Hoxha''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɔː|dʒ|ɑː}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hoxha "Hoxha"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-sq|ɛnˈvɛɾ ˈhɔdʒa|lang|Sq-Enver Hoxha.ogg}}; 16 October 1908{{spaced ndash}}11 April 1985)&lt;ref&gt;There is uncertainty over Hoxha's true date of birth. [[#CITEREFFevziu2016|Fevziu (2016)]], p.&amp;#8239;10) notes: "No fewer than five different dates are to be found in the Central State Archives [of Albania] alone."&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Albania]]n [[Communism|communist]] politician who served as the head of state of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] from 1944 until his death in 1985, as the [[Secretary (title)#Secretary-General|First Secretary]] of the [[Party of Labour of Albania]].  He was chairman of the [[Democratic Front of Albania]] and commander-in-chief of the armed forces from 1944 until his death. He served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Albania|22nd]] [[Prime Minister of Albania]] from 1944 to 1954 and at various times served as foreign minister and defence minister as well.

Born in [[Gjirokastër]] in 1908, Hoxha became a teacher in grammar school in 1936. Following Italy's [[Italian invasion of Albania|invasion of Albania]], he entered into the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] at its creation in 1941. Hoxha was elected First Secretary in March 1943 at the age of 34. The [[Yugoslav Partisans]] assisted the Albanians. Less than two years after [[Liberation Day (Albania)|the liberation of the country]], the monarchy was abolished, [[Zog I of Albania|King Zog]] was deposed and Hoxha rose to power as the head of state of Albania.

During his 40-year-rule, he focused on rebuilding the country, which was left in ruins after World War II, building Albania's first [[railway line]], raising the adult literacy rate from 5% to 98%, and leading Albania towards becoming agriculturally self-sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;''40 Years of Socialist Albania'', Dhimiter Picani&lt;!-- publishing info, ISSN/ISBN, page(s), year(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, detractors criticize him for a series of [[political repression]]s which included the establishment and use of [[Forced labour camps in Communist Albania|forced labor camps]], [[extrajudicial killing]]s and [[Capital punishment|executions]] that targeted and eliminated [[anti-communism|anti-communists]], a large number of which was carried out by the [[Sigurimi]] [[secret police]].

Hoxha's government was characterized by his proclaimed firm adherence to [[anti-revisionism|anti-revisionist]] [[Marxism–Leninism]] from the mid-1970s onwards. After his [[Sino-Albanian split|break]] with [[Maoism]] in the 1976–1978 period, numerous Maoist parties around the world declared themselves [[Hoxhaism|Hoxhaist]]. The [[International Conference of Marxist–Leninist Parties and Organizations (Unity &amp; Struggle)]] is the best-known association of these parties today.

==Early life==
[[File:Hodza house.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The house where Hoxha grew up in [[Gjirokastër]]]]
Hoxha was born in [[Gjirokastër]], a city in southern Albania (then a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]), the son of Halil Hoxha, a [[Muslim]] [[Tosks|Tosk]] cloth merchant who travelled widely across Europe and the United States, and Gjylihan (Gjylo) Hoxha née ''Çuçi''.

The Hoxha family was attached to the [[Bektashi Order]]; in 1916 his father brought him to seek the blessing of Baba Selim of the [[Zall Teqe]].&lt;ref name="tekke"&gt;[http://www.bektashi.net/bio-babarexheb.html Biography of Baba Rexheb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907165219/http://www.bektashi.net/bio-babarexheb.html |date=7 September 2008 }}: "[Enver Hoxha was] from the Gjirokastër area and [he] came from [a family] that [was] attached to the Bektashi tradition. In fact, fourteen years before Enver set off for France to study, his father brought him to seek the blessing of Baba Selim. The ''baba'' ([[dervish]]) was not one to refuse the request of a petitioner and he made a benediction over the boy."&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[maktab]], he followed his studies in the city senior high school "Liria". He started his studies at the Gjirokastër Lyceum in 1923. After the lyceum was closed, thanks to the intervention of [[Eqrem Libohova]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fevziu|2017|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoxha was awarded a state scholarship for the continuation of his studies in [[Korçë]], at the French language [[Albanian National Lyceum]] until 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dervishi|2012|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Enver Hoxha aged 18 1927.jpg|thumb|right|Enver Hoxha at age 18]]
In 1930, Hoxha went to study at the [[University of Montpellier]] in France on a state scholarship for the faculty of [[natural science]]. He never took an exam staying four years in Montpellier, against the Albanian laws of the time. He never returned the scholarship. He later went to Paris, where he presented himself to anti-Zogist immigrants as the brother-in-law of [[Bahri Omari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dervishi|2016|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 1935 to 1936, he was employed as a secretary at the Albanian consulate in [[Brussels]]. After returning to Albania, he worked as a contract teacher in the Gymnasium of Tirana. Hoxha taught morals in the Korça Liceum from 1937 to 1939 and also served as the caretaker of the school library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dervishi|2016|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 1939, Albania was [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded]] by [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1974|p=32, note 1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Italians established a puppet government, the [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–43)]], under [[Shefqet Vërlaci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1974|pp=34, 35, note 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoxha was indifferent regarding the invasion. 
In the summer of 1939 he went to Italy on vacation. At the end of 1939, he was transferred to the Gjirokastra Gymnasium, but he soon returned to Tirana. He was helped by his best friend, Esat Dishnica, who introduced Hoxha to Dishnica's cousin [[Ibrahim Biçakçiu]]. Hoxha started to sleep in Biçakçiu's tobacco factory "Flora", and after a while Dishnica opened a shop with the same name, where Hoxha started to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dervishi|2016|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a sympathizer of Korça's Communist Group&lt;ref&gt;[[Liri Belishova]], interviewed by Elisabeta Ilnica, ''E vërteta për Enverin'' (The truth about Enver), Panorama Newspaper, 13 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Partisan life==
[[File:Hoxha at Odrican 1944.jpg|thumb|250px|Hoxha as a partisan]]
On 8 November 1941, the Communist Party of Albania (later renamed the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] in 1948) was founded. Hoxha was chosen from the "Korca group" as a [[Muslim]] representative by the two [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] envoys as one of the seven members of the provisional [[Central Committee]]. The First Consultative Meeting of Activists of the Communist Party of Albania was held in Tirana from April 8 to 11, 1942,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1974|p=3, note 1}},&lt;/ref&gt; with Hoxha himself delivering the main report on 8 April 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1974|pp=3-30, "Report Delivered to the 1st Consultative Meeting of the Activists of the Communist Party of Albania"}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1942, Hoxha wrote "Call to the Albanian Peasantry", issued in the name of the Communist Party of Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1974|pp=31-38, "Call to the Albanian Peasantry"}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The call sought to enlist support in Albania for the war against the fascists.  The peasants were encouraged to hoard their grain and refuse to pay taxes or livestock levies brought by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1974|p=36, "Call to the Albanian Peasantry"}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the September 1942 Conference at [[Pezë]], the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Movement]] was founded with the purpose of uniting the [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] Albanians, regardless of ideology or class.

By March 1943, the first National Conference of the Communist Party elected Hoxha formally as First Secretary. During [[World War II]], the [[Soviet Union]]'s role in Albania was negligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=Of Enver Hoxha And Major Ivanov|date=1985-04-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-29|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 July 1943, the [[Albanian resistance during World War II|Albanian partisans]] were organised in regular units of companies, battalions and brigades and named the Albanian National Liberation Army. The organization received military support from the British intelligence service, [[Secret Intelligence Service|SOE]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernd J Fischer. "Resistance in Albania during the Second World War: Partisans, Nationalists and the S.O.E.", ''East European Quarterly'' 25 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The General Headquarters was created, with [[Spiro Moisiu]] as the commander and Hoxha as political [[commissar]]. The [[Yugoslav Partisans]] had a much more practical role, helping to plan attacks and exchanging supplies, but communication between them and the Albanians was limited and letters would often arrive late, sometimes well after a plan had been agreed upon by the National Liberation Army without consultation from the Yugoslav partisans.

Within Albania, repeated attempts were made during the war to remedy the communications difficulties which faced partisan groups. In August 1943, a secret meeting, the [[Mukje Conference]], was held between the anti-communist [[Balli Kombëtar]] (National Front) and the Communist Party of Albania. The result of this was an agreement to:

# Unite in a single struggle against the fascist invader.
# Cease all attacks between the two parties signing the agreement.
# Form a joint operational staff to coordinate military actions within Albania.
# Recognize that the democratically elected national liberations councils are the state power in Albania.
# Recognize that the goal for the post-war era is an independent, democratic Albania where the people themselves will decide the form of government.
# Recognize and respect the [[Atlantic Charter]], the London and Washington Treaties between the USSR, Great Britain and the United States in connection with the question of Kosovo and Çamëria. Be it resolved that the populations of Kosovo and Camëria will themselves decide their future in accordance with their wishes.
# Unite with any political group, whatever their beliefs, in a common military effort against the fascist invaders.
# However, the Communist Party of Albania will not collaborate with any group of the National Front that continues to maintain contacts with the fascist invaders.
# The Communist Party of Albania will unite with any group that used to have contacts with the fascist invaders, but has now terminated those contacts and is willing to now fight against the fascist invaders, provided those groups have not committed any crimes against the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1974|pp=167-168, "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Albania to the Vlora Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Albania"}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To encourage the Balli Kombëtar to sign, the [[Greater Albania]] sections that included Kosovo (part of [[Yugoslavia]]) and [[Chamëria]]  were made part of the Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disagreement with Yugoslav communists ===
A problem developed when the [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] Communists disagreed with the goal of a Greater Albania and asked the Communists in Albania to withdraw their agreement. According to Hoxha, [[Josip Broz Tito]] had not agreed that "Kosovo was Albanian" and that [[Serbs|Serbian]] opposition made the transfer an unwise option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Beloff|1985|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Albanian Communists repudiated the Greater Albania agreement, the Balli Kombëtar condemned the Communists, who in turn accused the Balli Kombëtar of siding with the Italians. The Balli Kombëtar, however, lacked support from the people. After judging the Communists as an immediate threat, the Balli Kombëtar sided with [[Nazi Germany]], fatally damaging its image among those fighting the Fascists. The Communists quickly added to their ranks many of those disillusioned with the Balli Kombëtar and took centre stage in the fight for liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|pp=10–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Jacques|1995|pp=491–493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Partisans in Tirana.jpg|thumb|right|Enver Hoxha following the liberation of Tirana in 1944]]
The Permet National Congress held during that time called for a "new democratic Albania for the people". Although the monarchy was not formally abolished, King Zog was barred from returning to the country, which further increased the Communists' control. The Anti-Fascist Committee for National Liberation was founded, chaired by Hoxha. On 22 October 1944, the Committee became the [[Democratic Government of Albania]] after a meeting in [[Berat]] and Hoxha was chosen as interim Prime Minister. Tribunals were set up to try alleged war criminals who were designated "[[enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and were presided over by [[Koçi Xoxe]].

After liberation on 29 November 1944, several Albanian partisan divisions crossed the border into German-occupied Yugoslavia, where they fought alongside Tito's partisans and the Soviet [[Red Army]] in a joint campaign which succeeded in driving out the last pockets of German resistance. Marshal Tito, during a Yugoslavian conference in later years, thanked Hoxha for the assistance that the Albanian partisans had given during the War for National Liberation (''Lufta Nacionalçlirimtare''). The [[Democratic Front of Albania|Democratic Front]], dominated by the Albanian Communist Party, succeeded the National Liberation Front in August 1945 and the first post-war election was the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1945|held on 2 December]]. The Front was the only legal political organisation allowed to stand in the elections, and the government reported that 93% of Albanians voted for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Jacques|1995|p=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Vickers|1999|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 1946, Zog was officially deposed and Albania was proclaimed the People's Republic of Albania (renamed the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]] in 1976). As First Secretary, Hoxha was ''de facto'' head of state and the most powerful man in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|title=Europa World Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGA4o-UhAfgC&amp;pg=PA441|accessdate=10 January 2012|date=September 2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-85743-254-1|page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albanians celebrate their independence day on 28 November (which is the date on which they declared their independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912), while in the former People's Socialist Republic of Albania the national day was 29 November, the day the country was liberated from the Italians. Both days are currently national holidays.

}}

Hoxha declared himself a [[Marxist–Leninist]] and strongly admired Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]]. During the period of 1945–1950, the government adopted policies which were intended to consolidate power. The Agrarian Reform Law was passed in August 1945. It confiscated land from [[beys]] and large landowners, giving it without compensation to peasants. 52% of all land was owned by large landowners before the law was passed; this declined to 16% after the law's passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Marmullaku|1975|pp=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illiteracy, which was 90–95% in rural areas in 1939 went down to 30% by 1950 and by 1985 it was equal to that of a Western country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+al0059) Library of Congress Country Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[State University of Tirana]] was established in 1957, which was the first of its kind in Albania. The [[Medieval]] [[Gjakmarrja]] (blood feud) was banned. [[Malaria]], the most widespread disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Gjonça|2001|p=15}} "20.1% of the population was infected."&lt;/ref&gt; was successfully fought through advances in health care, the use of [[DDT]], and through the draining of swamplands. From 1965 to 1985, no cases of malaria were reported, whereas previously Albania had the greatest number of infected patients in Europe.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Cikuli|1984|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; No cases of [[syphilis]] had been recorded for 30 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By 1949, the United States and British intelligence organisations were working with [[King Zog]] and the mountain men of his personal guard. They recruited Albanian refugees and émigrés from Egypt, Italy and Greece, trained them in Cyprus, Malta and the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), and infiltrated them into Albania. [[Albanian Subversion|Guerrilla units entered Albania in 1950 and 1952]], but they were killed or captured by Albanian security forces. [[Kim Philby]], a Soviet double agent working as a liaison officer between the British intelligence service and the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]], had leaked details of the infiltration plan to Moscow, and the security breach claimed the lives of about 300 infiltrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Jacques|1995|p=473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relations with Yugoslavia ===
[[File:Miladin Popović i Enver Hodža.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Miladin Popović]], an unknown partisan, and Enver Hoxha]]
At this point, relations with [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] had begun to change. The roots of the change began on 20 October 1944 at the Second Plenary Session of the Communist Party of Albania. The Session considered the problems that the post-independence Albanian government would face. However, the Yugoslav delegation led by Velimir Stoinić accused the party of "sectarianism and opportunism" and blamed Hoxha for these errors. He also stressed the view that the Yugoslav Communist partisans spearheaded the Albanian partisan movement.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell, p. 19"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Yugoslav members of the Albanian Communist Party had begun to think that this was a plot by Tito who intended to destabilize the Party. [[Koçi Xoxe]], [[Sejfulla Malëshova]] and others who supported Yugoslavia were looked upon with deep suspicion. Tito's position on Albania was that it was too weak to stand on its own and that it would do better as a part of Yugoslavia. Hoxha alleged that Tito had made it his goal to get Albania into Yugoslavia, firstly by creating the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and Mutual Aid in 1946. In time, Albania began to feel that the treaty was heavily slanted towards Yugoslav interests, much like the Italian agreements with Albania under Zog that made the nation dependent upon Italy.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell, p. 19" /&gt;

The first issue was that the [[Albanian lek]] became revalued in terms of the [[Yugoslav dinar]] as a [[customs union]] was formed and Albania's economic plan was decided more by Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Pano|1968|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albanian economists H. Banja and V. Toçi stated that the relationship between Albania and Yugoslavia during this period was exploitative and that it constituted attempts by Yugoslavia to make the Albanian economy an "appendage" to the Yugoslav economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Banja|Toçi|1979|p=66}} "...&amp;nbsp;Albania didn't need to create its national industry, but should limit her production to agricultural and mineral raw materials, which were to be sent for industrial processing to Yugoslavia. In other words, they wanted the Albanian economy to be a mere appendage of the Yugoslav economy."&lt;/ref&gt; Hoxha then began to accuse Yugoslavia of misconduct:
{{Quote
| text = We [Albania] were expected to produce for the Yugoslavs all the raw materials which they needed. These raw materials were to be exported to the metropolitan Yugoslavia to be processed there in Yugoslav factories. The same applied to the production of cotton and other industrial crops, as well as oil, bitumen, asphalt, chrome, etc. Yugoslavia would supply its 'colony', Albania, with exorbitantly priced consumer goods, including even items such as needles and thread, and would provide us with petrol and oil, as well as glass for the lamps in which we burn the fuel extracted from our subsoil, processed in Yugoslavia and sold to us at high prices&amp;nbsp;... The aim of the Yugoslavs was, therefore, to prevent our country from developing either its industry or its working class, and to make it forever dependent on Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Ranko Petković, "Yugoslavia and Albania," in ''Yugoslav-Albanian Relations'', trans. Zvonko Petnicki and Darinka Petković (Belgrade: Review of International Affairs, 1984, 274–275.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
[[Joseph Stalin]] advised Hoxha that Yugoslavia was attempting to annex Albania: "We did not know that the Yugoslavs, under the pretext of 'defending' your country against an attack from the Greek fascists, wanted to bring units of their army into the PRA [People's Republic of Albania]. They tried to do this in a very secretive manner. In reality, their aim in this direction was utterly hostile, for they intended to overturn the situation in Albania."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1981|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By June 1947, the Central Committee of Yugoslavia began publicly condemning Hoxha, accusing him of talking an individualistic and anti-Marxist line. When Albania responded by making agreements with the Soviet Union to purchase a supply of agricultural machinery, Yugoslavia said that Albania could not enter into any agreements with other countries without Yugoslav approval.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell, p. 22"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Koçi Xoxe]] tried to stop Hoxha from improving relations with [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], reasoning that Albania would be more stable with one trading partner rather than with many. [[Nako Spiru]], an anti-Yugoslav member of the Party, condemned Xoxe and vice versa. With no one coming to Spiru's defense, he viewed the situation as hopeless and feared that Yugoslav domination of his nation was imminent, which caused him to commit suicide in November.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell, p. 22" /&gt;

At the Eighth Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party which lasted from 26 February to 8 March 1948, Xoxe was implicated in a plot to isolate Hoxha and consolidate his own power. He accused Hoxha of being responsible for the decline in relations with Yugoslavia and stated that a Soviet military mission should be expelled in favor of a Yugoslav counterpart. Hoxha managed to remain firm and his support had not declined. When Yugoslavia publicly broke with the Soviet Union, Hoxha's support base grew stronger. Then, on 1 July 1948, Tirana called on all Yugoslav technical advisors to leave the country and unilaterally declared all treaties and agreements between the two countries null and void. Xoxe was expelled from the party and on 13 June 1949, he was executed by hanging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Jacques|1995|p=467}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relations with the Soviet Union ===
After the break with Yugoslavia, Hoxha aligned himself with the Soviet Union, for which he had a great admiration. From 1948 to 1960, $200 million in Soviet aid was given to Albania for technical and infrastructural expansion. Albania was admitted to the [[Comecon]] on 22 February 1949 and remained important both as a way to pressure Yugoslavia and to serve as a pro-Soviet force in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. A submarine base was built on the island of [[Sazan]] near [[Vlorë]], posing a possible threat to the [[United States Sixth Fleet]]. Relations remained close until the death of Stalin on 5 March 1953. His death was met with 14 days of national mourning in Albania—more than in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fevziu|2016|p=146}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoxha assembled the entire population in the capital's largest square featuring a statue of Stalin, requested that they kneel, and made them take a two-thousand word oath of "eternal fidelity" and "gratitude" to their "beloved father" and "great liberator" to whom the people owed "everything".&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'' 179 (16 June 1956): 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], Stalin's successor, aid was reduced and Albania was encouraged to adopt Khrushchev's specialization policy. Under this policy, Albania would develop its agricultural output in order to supply the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Warsaw Pact]] nations while these nations would be developing specific resource outputs of their own, which would, in theory, strengthen the Warsaw Pact by greatly reducing the lack of certain resources that many of the nations faced. However, this also meant that Albanian industrial development, which was stressed heavily by Hoxha, would have to be significantly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;On the "socialist division of labor" see: [http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=1163 The International Socialist Division of Labor (7 June 1962)], German History in Documents and Images.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Partia e Punës e Shqipërisë.svg|thumb|Symbol of the Party of Labour of Albania]]
From 16 May to 17 June 1955, [[Nikolai Bulganin]] and [[Anastas Mikoyan]] visited Yugoslavia and Khrushchev renounced the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the Communist bloc. Khrushchev also began making references to [[Palmiro Togliatti]]'s [[wikt:polycentric|polycentrism]] theory. Hoxha had not been consulted on this and was offended. Yugoslavia began asking for Hoxha to rehabilitate the image of [[Koçi Xoxe]], which Hoxha steadfastly rejected. In 1956 at the [[Twentieth Party Congress]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], Khrushchev [[Secret Speech|condemned]] the [[Stalin's cult of personality|cult of personality]] that had been built up around [[Joseph Stalin]] and also denounced him for many grave mistakes. Khrushchev then announced the theory of [[peaceful coexistence]], which angered Hoxha greatly. The Institute of Marxist–Leninist Studies, led by Hoxha's wife [[Nexhmije Hoxha|Nexhmije]], quoted [[Vladimir Lenin]]: "The fundamental principle of the foreign policy of a socialist country and of a Communist party is [[proletarian internationalism]]; not peaceful coexistence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|The Institute of Marxist–Leninist Studies at the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania|1982|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoxha now took a more active stand against perceived [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]].

Unity within the [[Albanian Party of Labour]] began to decline as well, with a special delegate meeting held in Tirana in April 1956, composed of 450 delegates and having unexpected results. The delegates "criticized the conditions in the party, the negative attitude toward the masses, the absence of party and socialist democracy, the economic policy of the leadership, etc." while also calling for discussions on the cult of personality and the Twentieth Party Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griffith|1963|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Movement towards China and Maoism ====
[[File:Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha.jpg|thumb|[[Mao Zedong]] and Hoxha in 1956]]
In 1956, Hoxha called for a [[conflict resolution|resolution]] which would uphold the current leadership of the Party. The resolution was accepted, and all of the delegates who had spoken out were expelled from the party and imprisoned. Hoxha stated that this was yet another of many attempts to overthrow the leadership of Albania which had been organized by Yugoslavia. This incident further consolidated Hoxha's power, effectively making Khrushchev-esque reforms nearly impossible. In the same year, Hoxha traveled to the [[People's Republic of China]], which was then enduring the [[Sino-Soviet split]], and met [[Mao Zedong]]. Relations with China improved, as evidenced by Chinese aid to Albania being 4.2% in 1955 before the visit, and rising to 21.6% in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biberaj|1986|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to keep Albania in the Soviet sphere, increased aid was given but the Albanian leadership continued to move closer towards China. Relations with the Soviet Union remained at the same level until 1960, when Khrushchev met [[Sofoklis Venizelos]], a left-wing Greek politician. Khrushchev sympathized with the concept of an autonomous Greek [[North Epirus]] and he hoped to use Greek claims to keep the Albanian leadership in line with Soviet interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoxha reacted by only sending [[Hysni Kapo]], a member of the Albanian Political Bureau, to the Third Congress of the [[Romanian Workers' Party]] in [[Bucharest]], an event that heads of state were normally expected to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; As relations between the two countries continued to deteriorate in the course of the meeting, Khrushchev said:
{{Quote
| text = Especially shameless was the behavior of that agent of Mao Zedong, Enver Hoxha. He bared his fangs at us even more menacingly than the Chinese themselves. After his speech, Comrade [[Dolores Ibárruri]] [a Spanish Communist], an old revolutionary and a devoted worker in the Communist movement, got up indignantly and said, very much to the point, that Hoxha was like a dog who bites the hand that feeds it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Talbott|1970|pp=475–476}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
&lt;!-- [[File:Enver &amp; Mao Tse Dung.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Hoxha and Mao shaking hands in a Chinese Communist propaganda poster]] --&gt;

==== Friction with the Soviet Union ====
Relations with the Soviet Union began to decline rapidly. A [[hardline]] policy was adopted and the Soviets reduced aid shipments, specifically grain, at a time when Albania needed them due to the possibility of a flood-induced [[famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1980b}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1960, a plot to overthrow the Albanian government was discovered. It was to be organized by Soviet-trained Rear Admiral [[Teme Sejko]]. After this, two pro-Soviet members of the Party, [[Liri Belishova]] and [[Koço Tashko]], were expelled, with a humorous incident involving Tashko pronouncing ''[[Wiktionary:точка#Russian|tochka]]'' (Russian for "[[full stop]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1976|pp=109 note 2, 110,"This ridiculous action of Koço Tashko made it quite evident that the text of his contribution had been dictated by an official of the Soviet Embassy and during the translation he had become confused, failing to distinguish between the text and the punctuation marks."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, the Party's Central Committee sent a letter of protest to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, stating its displeasure at having an anti-Albanian Soviet Ambassador in Tirana. The Fourth Congress of the Party, held from 13 to 20 February 1961, was the last meeting that the Soviet Union or other Eastern European nations attended in Albania. During the congress, the Soviet Union was condemned while China was praised. [[Mehmet Shehu]] stated that while many members of the Party were accused of [[tyranny]], this was a baseless charge and unlike the Soviet Union, Albania was led by genuine Marxists.

The Soviet Union retaliated by threatening "dire consequences" if the condemnations were not retracted. Days later, Khrushchev and [[Antonín Novotný]], [[President of Czechoslovakia]] (which was Albania's largest source of aid besides the Soviets), threatened to cut off economic aid. In March, Albania was not invited to attend the meeting of the [[Warsaw Pact]] nations (Albania had been one of its founding members in 1955) and in April all Soviet technicians were withdrawn from the nation. In May nearly all Soviet troops on the [[Orikum]] naval base were withdrawn, leaving the Albanians with 4 submarines and other military equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|The Institute of Marxist–Leninist Studies at the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania|1982|pp=451–474|Chapter 13: The Final Act}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 November 1961, Hoxha made a speech in which he called Khrushchev a "revisionist, an anti-Marxist and a defeatist". Hoxha portrayed Stalin as the last Communist leader of the Soviet Union and he began to stress Albania's independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|The Institute of Marxist–Leninist Studies at the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania|1982|p=359, "...&amp;nbsp;the Albanian people and their Party of Labour will even live on grass if need be, but they will never sell themselves 'for 30 pieces of silver',&amp;nbsp;... They would rather die honourably on their feet than live in shame on their knees."}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 11 November, the USSR and every other Warsaw Pact nation broke relations with Albania. Albania was unofficially excluded (by not being invited) from both the [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[Comecon]]. The Soviet Union also attempted to claim control of the [[Vlorë]] port due to a lease agreement; the Albanian Party then passed a law prohibiting any other nation from owning an Albanian port through lease or otherwise. The [[Soviet–Albanian split]] was now complete.

== Later rule ==
[[File:Albania bunkers.jpg|thumb|[[Bunkers in Albania]] built during Hoxha's rule to avert the possibility of external invasions. By 1983 approximately 173,371 concrete bunkers were scattered throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shqiptarja.com/speciale/2751/ekskluzive-hapet-dosja-ja-harta-e-bunkereve-e-tuneleve-sekrete-257289.html Hapet dosja, ja harta e bunkerëve dhe tuneleve sekretë]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As Hoxha's leadership continued, he took on an increasingly [[theoretical]] stance. He wrote criticisms based both on current events at the time and on theory; most notably his condemnations of [[Maoism]] post-1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major achievement under Hoxha was the advancement of [[Women's rights in Albania|women's rights]]. Albania had been one of the most, if not the most, [[patriarchal]] countries in Europe. The ''[[Code of Lekë]]'', which regulated the status of women, states, "A woman is known as a sack, made to endure as long as she lives in her husband's house."&lt;ref&gt;''Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit'' [The Code of Lekë Dukagjini] (Prishtinë, Kosove: Rilindja, 1972): bk. 3, chap. 5, no. 29, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were not allowed to inherit anything from their parents, and discrimination was even made in the case of the murder of a pregnant woman:
{{Quote
| text =...&amp;nbsp;the dead woman [is] to be opened up, in order to see whether the fetus is a boy or a girl. If it is a boy, the murderer must pay 3 purses [a set amount of local currency] for the woman's blood and 6 purses for the boy's blood; if it is a girl, aside from the three purses for the murdered woman, 3 purses must also be paid for the female child.&lt;ref&gt;''Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit'' [The Code of Lekë Dukagjini], bk. 10, chap. 22, no. 130, secs. 936–937, 178.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Women were forbidden from obtaining a divorce, and the wife's parents were obliged to return a runaway daughter to her husband or else suffer shame which could even result in a generations-long [[blood feud]]. During [[World War II]], the Albanian Communists encouraged women to join the partisans&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Papajorgi|1970|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; and following the war, women were encouraged to take up menial jobs, as the education necessary for higher level work was out of most women's reach. In 1938, 4% worked in various sectors of the economy. In 1970, this number had risen to 38%, and in 1982 to 46%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Begeja|1984|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cultural and Ideological Revolution (discussed below), women were encouraged to take up ''all'' jobs, including government posts, which resulted in 40.7% of the People's Councils and 30.4% of the People's Assembly being made up of women, including two women in the Central Committee by 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Jacques|1995|p=557}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, 15.1 times as many females attended eight-year schools as had done so in 1938 and 175.7 times as many females attended secondary schools. By 1978, 101.9 times as many women attended higher schools as in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;The Directorate of Statistics at the State Planning Commission, ''35 Years of Socialist Albania'' (Tirana: 8 Nëntori Publishing House, 1981), 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoxha said of women's rights in 1967:&lt;blockquote&gt;The entire party and country should hurl into the fire and break the neck of anyone who dared trample underfoot the sacred edict of the party on the defense of women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Logoreci|1978|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1969, direct taxation was abolished&lt;ref&gt;''An Outline of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania''. Tirana: The 8 Nëntori Publishing House, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and during this period the quality of schooling and health care continued to improve. An electrification campaign was begun in 1960 and the entire nation was expected to have electricity by 1985. Instead, it achieved this on 25 October 1970, making it the first nation with complete electrification in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Pollo|Puto|1981|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source | date=October 2015}} During the Cultural &amp; Ideological Revolution of 1967–1968 the [[Military of Albania|military]] changed from traditional Communist army tactics and began to adhere to the [[Maoist]] strategy known as [[people's war]], which included the abolition of [[military rank]]s, which were not fully restored until 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Vickers|1999|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehmet Shehu said of the country's health service in 1979:'

{{Quote
| text =...&amp;nbsp;[T]he health service is free of charge for all and has been extended to the remotest villages. In 1960 we had one doctor per every 3,360 inhabitants, in 1978 we had one doctor per every 687 inhabitants, and this despite the rapid growth of the population. The natural increase of the population in our country is 3.5 times higher than the annual average of European countries, whereas mortality in 1978 was 37% lower than the average level of mortality in the countries of Europe, and the average life expectancy in our country has risen, from about 38 years in 1938 to 69 years. That is, for each year of the existence of our people's state power, the average life expectancy has risen by about 11 months. That is what socialism does for man! Is there a loftier humanism than socialist humanism, which, in 35 years, doubles the average life expectancy of the whole population of the country?&lt;ref&gt;Mehmet Shehu, "The Magnificent Balance of Victories in the Course of 35 Years of Socialist Albania", Speech (Tirana: 8 Nëntori Publishing House, 1979), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[File:Mali i Shpiragut.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Hoxha's first name engraved on the side of Shpiragu Mountain]]
Hoxha's legacy also included a [[Bunkers in Albania|complex of 750,000 one-man concrete bunkers]] across a country of 3 million inhabitants, to act as look-outs and gun emplacements along with [[chemical weapon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A61698-2005Jan9?language=printer Albania's Chemical Cache Raises Fears About Others]", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Monday 10 January 2005, Page A01&lt;/ref&gt; The bunkers were built strong and mobile, with the intention that they could be easily placed by a crane or a helicopter in a previously dug hole. The types of bunkers vary from machine gun pillboxes, beach bunkers, to underground naval facilities, and even Air Force Mountain and underground bunkers.

Hoxha's internal policies were true to Stalin's paradigm which he admired, and the [[Cult of personality|personality cult]] developed in the 1970s organized around him by the [[Albanian Party of Labour|Party]] also bore a striking resemblance to that of Stalin. At times it even reached an intensity similar to the [[Kim Il-sung's cult of personality|personality cult]] surrounding [[Kim Il-sung]] (which Hoxha condemned&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1979b|p=517, "In [[Pyongyang]], I believe that even Tito will be astonished at the proportions of the cult of his host, which has reached a level unheard of anywhere else, either in past or present times, let alone in a country which calls itself socialist."}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with Hoxha being portrayed as a genius commenting on virtually all facets of life from culture to economics to military matters. Each schoolbook required one or more quotations from him on the subjects being studied.&lt;ref&gt;Kosta Koçi, interview with James S. O'Donnell, ''A Coming of Age: Albania under Enver Hoxha'', Tape recording, Tirana, 12 April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The Party honored him with titles such as Supreme Comrade, Sole Force and Great Teacher.

Hoxha's governance was also distinguished by his encouragement of a high birthrate policy. For instance, a woman who bore an above-average number of children would be given the government award of ''Heroine Mother'' (in Albanian: ''Nënë Heroinë'') along with cash rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medals.org.uk/albania/albania-pr/albania-pr021.htm|title=ODM of Albania: Title "Mother Heroine"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion was essentially restricted (to encourage high birth rates), except if the birth posed a danger to the mother's life, though it was not completely banned; the process was decided by district medical commissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ash|1974|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/albani1.doc Albania – ABORTION POLICY – United Nations]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Demographics of Albania|population of Albania]] tripled from 1 million in 1944 to around 3&amp;nbsp;million in 1985.

=== Relations with China ===
[[File:Mao-Hoxha CR Poster.jpg|thumb|A [[Cultural Revolution]] poster promoting Albanian-Chinese cooperation featuring Hoxha and Mao. The caption at the bottom reads, "Long live the great union between the Parties of Albania and China!" Despite what the painting may suggest, the two leaders met only twice—first in 1956 during Hoxha's visit to China, and again in 1957 at the Moscow meeting of communist and workers' parties—before the Sino-Albanian alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1980b|pp=231-234, 240-250, "My First and Last Visit to China"}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In Albania's [[Third Five Year Plan]], China promised a loan of $125&amp;nbsp;million to build twenty-five chemical, electrical and metallurgical plants called for under the Plan. However, the nation experienced a difficult transition period, because Chinese technicians were of a lower quality than Soviet ones and the great distance between the two nations, plus the poor relations which Albania had with its neighbors, further complicated matters. Unlike Yugoslavia or the USSR, China had less economic influence on Albania during Hoxha's leadership. The previous fifteen years (1946–1961) had at least 50% of the economy under foreign commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biberaj|1986|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the 1976 Constitution was promulgated, which prohibited foreign debt, aid and investment, Albania had basically become self-sufficient although it was lacking in modern technology. Ideologically, Hoxha found Mao's initial views to be in line with [[Marxism-Leninism]]. Mao condemned [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s alleged [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]] and he was also critical of Yugoslavia. Aid given from China was interest-free and it did not have to be repaid until Albania could afford to do so.&lt;ref name="Hamm, 45"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hamm|1963|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China never intervened in what Albania's economic output should be, and Chinese technicians worked for the same wages as Albanian workers, unlike Soviet technicians who sometimes made more than three times the pay of Hoxha.&lt;ref name="Hamm, 45" /&gt; Albanian newspapers were reprinted in Chinese newspapers and read on Chinese radio. Finally, Albania led the movement [[China and the United Nations|to give the People's Republic of China a seat]] on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]], an effort which would prove successful in 1971 when it replaced the [[Taiwan|Republic of China's]] seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Pearson|2006|p=628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, Albania became the second largest producer of [[chromium]] in the world, which was considered an important export for Albania. Strategically, the [[Adriatic Sea]] was also attractive to China, and the Chinese leadership had hoped to gain more allies in [[Eastern Europe]] with Albania's help, although this effort failed. [[Zhou Enlai]] visited Albania in January 1964. On 9 January, "The 1964 Sino-Albanian Joint Statement" was signed in Tirana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biberaj|1986|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The statement said of relations between socialist countries:
{{Quote
| text = Both [Albania and China] hold that the relations between socialist countries are international relations of a new type. Relations between socialist countries, big or small, economically more developed or less developed, must be based on the principles of complete equality, respect for territorial sovereignty and independence, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and must also be based on the principles of mutual assistance in accordance with proletarian internationalism. It is necessary to oppose great-nation chauvinism and national egoism in relations between socialist countries. It is absolutely impermissible to impose the will of one country upon another, or to impair the independence, sovereignty and interests of the people, of a fraternal country on the pretext of 'aid' or 'international division of labour.'&lt;ref&gt;"Sino-Albanian Joint Statement," ''Peking Review'' (17 January 1964) 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Like Albania, China defended the "purity" of [[Marxism]] by attacking both [[American imperialism|US imperialism]] and "Soviet and Yugoslav revisionism", both equally as part of a "dual adversary" theory.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell, p. 68"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|p=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yugoslavia was viewed as both a "special detachment of U.S. imperialism" and a "saboteur against world revolution."&lt;ref name="O'Donnell, p. 68" /&gt; These views, however, began to change in China, which was one of the major issues which Albania had with the alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biberaj|1986|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also unlike Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, the Sino-Albanian alliance lacked "...&amp;nbsp;an organizational structure for regular consultations and policy coordination, and it was also characterized by an informal relationship which was conducted on an ''ad hoc'' basis." Mao made a speech on 3 November 1966 in which he claimed that Albania was the only [[Marxist-Leninist]] state in Europe and in the same speech, he also stated that "an attack on Albania will have to reckon with great People's China. If the U.S. imperialists, the modern Soviet revisionists or any of their lackeys dare to touch Albania in the slightest, nothing lies ahead for them but a complete, shameful and memorable defeat."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hamm|1963|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Hoxha stated that "You may rest assured, comrades, that come what may in the world at large, our two parties and our two peoples will certainly remain together. They will fight together and they will win together."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biberaj|1986|p=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shift in Chinese foreign policy after the Cultural Revolution ====
China entered into a four-year period of relative diplomatic isolation following the [[Cultural Revolution]] and at this point relations between China and Albania reached their zenith. On 20 August 1968, the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] was condemned by Albania, as was the [[Brezhnev doctrine]]. Albania then officially withdrew from the Warsaw Pact on 5 September. Relations with China began to deteriorate on 15 July 1971, when United States President [[Richard Nixon]] agreed to visit China to meet with [[Zhou Enlai]]. Hoxha felt betrayed and the government was in a state of shock. On 6 August a letter was sent from the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, calling Nixon a "frenzied anti-Communist". The letter stated:
{{Quote
| text = We trust you will understand the reason for the delay in our reply. This was because your decision came as a surprise to us and it was taken without any preliminary consultation between us on this question, so that we would be able to express and thrash out our opinions. This, we think, could have been useful, because preliminary consultations, between close friends, determined co-fighters against imperialism and revisionism, are useful and necessary, and especially so, when steps which, in our opinion, have a major international effect and repercussions are taken.

...Considering the Communist Party of China as a sister party and our closest co-fighter, we have never hidden our views from it. That is why on this major problem which you put before us, we inform you that we consider your decision to receive Nixon in Beijing as incorrect and undesirable, and we do not approve or support it. It will also be our opinion that Nixon's announced visit to China will not be understood or approved of by the peoples, the revolutionaries and the communists of different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1982|pp=666–668}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The result was a 1971 message from the Chinese leadership stating that Albania could not depend on an indefinite flow of further Chinese aid and in 1972, Albania was advised to "curb its expectations about further Chinese contributions to its economic development".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biberaj|1986|p=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1973, Hoxha wrote in his diary ''Reflections on China'' that the Chinese leaders:
{{Quote
| text =...&amp;nbsp;have cut off their contacts with us, and the contacts which they maintain are merely formal diplomatic ones. Albania is no longer the 'faithful, special friend'...&amp;nbsp;They are maintaining the economic agreements though with delays, but it is quite obvious that their 'initial ardor' has died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1979b|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
In response, trade with COMECON (although trade with the Soviet Union was still blocked) and Yugoslavia grew. Trade with Third World nations was $0.5&amp;nbsp;million in 1973, but $8.3&amp;nbsp;million in 1974. Trade rose from 0.1% to 1.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biberaj|1986|pp=98–99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Mao's death on 9 September 1976, Hoxha (who attended Mao's funeral in Beijing) remained optimistic about Sino-Albanian relations, but in August 1977, [[Hua Guofeng]], the new leader of China, stated that Mao's [[Three Worlds Theory]] would become official foreign policy. Hoxha viewed this as a way for China to justify having the U.S. as the "secondary enemy" while viewing the Soviet Union as the main one, thus allowing China to trade with the U.S. "the Chinese plan of the 'third world' is a major diabolical plan, with the aim that China should become another superpower, precisely by placing itself at the head of the 'third world' and the 'non-aligned world'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoxha|1979b|p=656}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 30 August to 7 September 1977, [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] visited [[Beijing]] and was welcomed by the Chinese leadership. At this point, the Albanian Party of Labour had declared that China was now a revisionist state akin to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and that Albania was the only Marxist–Leninist state on Earth. Hoxha stated:

{{Quote
| text = The Chinese leaders are acting like the leaders of a 'great state'. They think, 'The Albanians fell out with the Soviet Union because they had us, and if they fall with us, too, they will go back to the Soviets,' therefore they say, 'Either with us or the Soviets, it is all the same, the Albanians are done for.' But to hell with them! We shall fight against all this trash, because we are Albanian Marxist–Leninists and on our correct course we shall always triumph!&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1979b|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

On 13 July 1978, China announced that it was cutting off all aid to Albania. For the first time in modern history, Albania did not have either an ally or a major trading partner.

=== Political repressions and emigration ===
[[File:Former political prison in Girokaster.jpg|thumb|Former political prison in Girokaster. During Hoxha's regime political executions were common, and as a result possibly as many as 25,000 people were killed by the regime and many more were sent to labour camps or persecuted.]]
[[File:Tirana Park+Statues.jpg|thumb|Checkpoint memorial in Tirana featuring a bunker, walls from [[Spaç Prison]], and a fragment of the [[Berlin Wall]].]]
Certain clauses in the 1976 constitution effectively circumscribed the exercise of political liberties which the government interpreted as contrary to the established order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|p=129}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the government denied the population access to information other than that disseminated by the government-controlled media.  Internally, the [[Sigurimi]] followed the repressive methods of the [[NKVD]], [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]], [[KGB]], and the [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] [[Stasi]].  At one point, every third Albanian had either been interrogated by the Sigurimi or incarcerated in [[Forced labor camps in Communist Albania|labour camps]].&lt;ref&gt;Raymond E. Zickel &amp; Walter R. Iwaskiw. ''Albania: A Country Study''. Washington, D.C.: Federal Research Division of the United States Library of Congress. p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

To eliminate dissent, the government imprisoned thousands in forced-labour camps or executed them for crimes such as alleged treachery or for disrupting the [[Dictatorship of the Proletariat|proletarian dictatorship]]. Travel abroad was forbidden after 1968 to all but those who were on official business. [[Western culture|Western European culture]] was looked upon with deep suspicion, resulting in arrests and bans on any unauthorised foreign material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4379499.stm Dance fever reaches Albania] "The former student, now the mayor of Tirana, said that he would cower beneath the bedclothes at night listening to foreign radio stations, an activity punishable by a long stretch in a labour camp. He became fascinated by the saxophone. Yet, because such instruments were considered to be an evil influence and were thus banned, he had never seen one. "&lt;/ref&gt; Art was required to reflect the styles of [[socialist realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Keefe, Eugene K. ''Area Handbook for Albania''. Washington, D.C.: The American University (Foreign Area Studies), 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Beards were banned as unhygienic in order to curb the influence of [[Islam]] (many [[Imam]]s and [[Bektashi|Babas]] had beards) and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] faith.

The justice system regularly degenerated into [[show trial]]s. An American [[human rights]] group described the proceedings of one trial:  "...&amp;nbsp;[The defendant] was not permitted to question the witnesses and that, although he was permitted to state his objections to certain aspects of the case, his objections were dismissed by the prosecutor who said, 'Sit down and be quiet. We know better than you.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Minnesota Lawyers International Human Rights Committee|1990|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to lessen the threat of political dissidents and other exiles, relatives of the accused were often arrested, [[ostracised]], and accused of being "[[enemies of the people]]".&lt;ref&gt;James S. O'Donnell, "Albania's Sigurimi: The ultimate agents of social control" ''Problems of Post-Communism'' #42 (Nov/Dec 1995): 5p.&lt;/ref&gt; Political executions were common, and as a result at least 5,000 people—possibly as many as 25,000—were killed by the regime.&lt;ref&gt;15 Feb 1994 Washington Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"WHPSI": The World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators by Charles Lewis Taylor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;8 July 1997 NY Times&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Torture]] was often used to obtain confessions:&lt;blockquote&gt;One émigré, for example, testified to being bound by his hands and legs for one and a half months, and to being beaten with a belt, fists or boots for periods of two to three hours every two or three days. Another was detained in a cell one meter by eight meters large in the local police station and kept in [[solitary confinement]] for a five-day period punctuated by two beating sessions until he signed a confession; he was taken to ''Sigurimi'' headquarters, where he was again tortured and questioned, despite his prior confession, until his three-day trial. Still another witness was confined underground for more than a year in a three-meter square cell. During this time he was interrogated at irregular intervals and subjected to various forms of physical and psychological torture. He was chained to a chair, beaten, and subjected to electric shocks. He was shown a bullet that was supposedly meant for him and told that car engines starting within his earshot were driving victims to their executions, the next of which would be his.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Minnesota Lawyers International Human Rights Committee|1990|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;During Hoxha's rule, "[t]here were six institutions for political prisoners and fourteen labour camps where political prisoners and common criminals worked together. It has been estimated that there were approximately 32,000 people imprisoned in Albania in 1985."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|p=134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 47 of the Albanian Criminal Code stated that to "escape outside the state, as well as refusal to return to the Fatherland by a person who has been sent to serve or has been permitted temporarily to go outside the state" was an act of [[treason]], a crime punishable by a minimum sentence of ten years and a maximum sentence of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Minnesota Lawyers International Human Rights Committee|1990|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Albanian government went to great lengths in order to prevent people from defecting by leaving the country:&lt;blockquote&gt;An electrically-wired metal fence stands 600 meters to one kilometer from the actual border. Anyone touching the fence not only risks electrocution, but also sets off alarm bells and lights which alert guards stationed at approximately one-kilometer intervals along the fence. Two meters of soil on either side of the fence are cleared in order to check for footprints of escapees and infiltrators. The area between the fence and the actual border is seeded with booby traps such as coils of wire, noise makers consisting of thin pieces of metal strips on top of two wooden slats with stones in a tin container which rattle if stepped on, and flares that are triggered by contact, thus illuminating would-be escapees during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Minnesota Lawyers International Human Rights Committee|1990|pp=50–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Further|State atheism#Albania|Religion in Albania#Communist Albania}}
Albania, the only predominantly [[Muslim]] country in Europe at that time, largely owing to Turkish influence in the region, had not, like the [[Ottoman Empire]], identified religion with ethnicity. In the Ottoman Empire, Muslims were viewed as Turks, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] were viewed as Greeks, and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] were viewed as Latins. Hoxha believed this was a serious issue, feeling that it both fueled Greek separatists in southern Albania and that it also divided the nation in general. The Agrarian Reform Law of 1945 confiscated much of the church's property in the country. Catholics were the earliest religious community to be targeted since the [[Holy See|Vatican]] was seen as being an agent of [[Fascism]] and [[anti-Communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Logoreci|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946 the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]] was banned and the [[Franciscans]] were banned in 1947. ''Decree No. 743'' (On religion) sought a [[State religion|national church]] and forbade religious leaders to associate with foreign powers.

The Party focused on atheist education in schools. This tactic was effective, primarily due to the high birthrate policy encouraged after the war. During what the religious consider "holy periods," such as [[Lent]] and [[Ramadan]], many foods which are scorned by them (dairy products, meat, etc.) were distributed in schools and factories, and those who refused to eat those foods were denounced.

Starting on 6 February 1967, the Party began to promote [[secularism]] over [[Abrahamic religions]]. Hoxha, who had declared a "Cultural and Ideological Revolution" after being partly inspired by China's [[Cultural Revolution]], encouraged communist students and workers to use more forceful tactics to discourage religious practices, although violence was initially condemned.&lt;ref&gt;Enver Hoxha, "The Communists Lead by Means of Example, Sacrifices, Abnegation: Discussion in the Organization of the Party, Sector C, of the 'Enver' Plant", 2 March 1967, in Hoxha, E., Vepra, n. 35, Tirana, 1982, pp. 130–1. "In this matter violence, exaggerated or inflated actions must be condemned. Here it is necessary to use persuasion and only persuasion, political and ideological work, so that the ground is prepared for each concrete action against religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hoxha, the surge in [[Antitheism|anti-theist]] activity began with the youth. The result of this "spontaneous, unprovoked movement" was the closing of all 2,169 [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[mosque]]s in Albania. [[State atheism]] became official policy, and Albania was declared the world's first atheist state. Town and city names which echoed Abrahamic religious themes were abandoned for neutral secular ones, as well as personal names. During this period religiously based names were also made illegal. The ''Dictionary of People's Names'', published in 1982, contained 3,000 approved, secular names. In 1992, Monsignor Dias, the Papal Nuncio for Albania appointed by [[Pope John Paul II]], said that of the three hundred Catholic priests present in Albania prior to the Communists coming to power, only thirty were still active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/27/world/albania-s-clerics-lead-a-rebirth.html|title=ALBANIA'S CLERICS LEAD A REBIRTH|last=Kamm|first=Henry|date=1992-03-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-29|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotion of religion was banned and all clerics were outlawed as reactionaries. Those religious figures who refused to embrace the principles of [[Marxism–Leninism]] were either arrested or carried on their activities in hiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Jacques|1995|pp=489, 495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultivating nationalism ===
{{Main article|Albanian nationalism}}

Enver Hoxha had declared during the anti-religious campaign that "the only religion of Albania is Albanianism",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Reynolds|2001|p=233 "... the country." Henceforth, Hoxha announced, the only religion would be "Albanianism. ... "}}&lt;/ref&gt; a quotation from the poem ''O moj Shqiperi'' ("O Albania") by the 19th-century Albanian writer [[Pashko Vasa]].

[[Muzafer Korkuti]], one of the dominant figures in post-war Albanian archaeology and now Director of the Institute of Archaeology in Tirana, said this in an interview on 10 July 2002:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Galatia|Watkinson|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Archaeology is part of the politics which the party in power has and this was understood better than anything else by Enver Hoxha. Folklore and archaeology were respected because they are the indicators of the nation, and a party that shows respect to national identity is listened to by other people; good or bad as this may be. Enver Hoxha did this as did Hitler. In Germany in the 1930s there was an increase in Balkan studies and languages and this too was all part of nationalism.}}

Efforts were focused on an [[Illyrians|Illyrian]]-Albanian continuity issue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
An Illyrian origin of the Albanians (without denying ''Pelasgian'' roots&lt;ref name="schwandner2"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schwandner-Sievers|Fischer|2002|p=96}} "but when Enver Hoxha declared that their origin was Illyrian (without denying their Pelasgian roots), no one dared participate in further discussion of the question".&lt;/ref&gt;) continued to play a significant role in Albanian nationalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Eya|1997|p=196}} "From time to time the state gave out lists with pagan, supposed Illyrian or newly constructed names that would be proper for the new generation of revolutionaries."&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a revival of given names supposedly of "Illyrian" origin, at the expense of given names associated with [[Christianity]]. At first, Albanian nationalist writers opted for the Pelasgians as the forefathers of the Albanians, but as this form of nationalism flourished in Albania under Enver Hoxha, the Pelasgians became a secondary element&lt;ref name="schwandner2" /&gt; to the Illyrian theory of [[Albanian origins]], which could claim some support in scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Madgearu|Gordon|2008|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Illyrian descent theory soon became one of the pillars of Albanian nationalism, especially because it could provide some evidence of continuity of an Albanian presence both in [[Kosovo]] and [[Southern Albania]], i.e., areas that were subject to [[ethnic conflict]]s between [[Albanians]], [[Serbs]] and [[Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schwandner-Sievers|Fischer|2002|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the government of Enver Hoxha, an [[Indigenism|autochthonous]] [[ethnogenesis]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; was promoted and physical anthropologists&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; tried to demonstrate that Albanians were different from any other [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] populations, a theory now disproved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belledi|first=Michele|last2=Poloni|first2=Estella S.|last3=Casalotti|first3=Rosa|last4=Conterio|first4=Franco|last5=Mikerezi|first5=Ilia|last6=Tagliavini|first6=James|last7=Excoffier|first7=Laurent|date=2000|title=Maternal and paternal lineages in Albania and the genetic structure of Indo-European populations|url=https://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v8/n7/pdf/5200443a.pdf|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|publisher=Macmillan|volume=8|pages=480–486|via=|doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5200443}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They claimed that the Illyrians were the most ancient people&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Bideleux|Jeffries|2007|p=23}} "they thus claim to be the oldest indigenous people of the western Balkans".&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Balkans]] and greatly extended the age of the [[Illyrian language]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Bideleux|Jeffries|2007|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejecting Western mass media culture===
Hoxha and his government were hostile to Western (American and British-led) [[popular culture]] as it manifested in the [[mass media]], along with the [[consumerism]] and [[social liberalism]] associated with it. In a speech on the Fourth Plenum of the Central Committee of the PLA (PLA-CC) on 26 June 1973, Hoxha declared a definitive break from any such Western bourgeois influence and what he described as its ''[[degeneration theory|degenerated]] bourgeois culture''.&lt;ref name="bon"/&gt; In a speech in which he also criticised the "spread of certain vulgar, alien tastes in music and art", which ran "contrary to socialist ethics and the positive traditions of our people", including "degenerate importations such as long hair, extravagant dress, screaming jungle music, coarse language, shameless behaviour and so on",&lt;ref name="bon"/&gt; Hoxha declared; 

{{quote|It is precisely this culture, coated with a glossy veneer, accompanied by sensational advertisement, handled in the most commercial way and back up and financed by the bourgeoisie, that inundates the cinema and television screens, magazines, newspapers and radio broadcasts, all the mass information and propaganda media. Its objective is to turn the ordinary man into a passive consumer of poisonous bourgeois ideas, and to make this consumption an addiction. Not only have we nothing to learn from this culture, no reason to impart it to our masses and youth, but we must reject it contemptuously and fight it with determinism.&lt;ref name="bon"&gt;{{harvnb|Bönker|2016|p=238}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Later life and death ==
[[File:Albania in 1978 1.jpg|thumb|250px|Propaganda (photographed in 1978): ''The fatherland is defended by all of the people'']]
A new Constitution was decided upon by the Seventh Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour on 1–7 November 1976. According to Hoxha, "The old Constitution was the Constitution of the building of the foundations of socialism, whereas the new Constitution will be the Constitution of the complete construction of a socialist society."&lt;ref&gt;Enver Hoxha, ''Report on the Activity of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania'' (Tirana: 8 Nëntori Publishing House, 1977), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-reliance was now stressed more than ever. Citizens were encouraged to train in the use of weapons, and this activity was also taught in schools. This was to encourage the creation of quick [[Partisan (military)|partisans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gadling.com/2008/06/26/letter-from-albania-enver-hoxhas-legacy-and-the-question-of-t/ Letter from Albania: Enver Hoxha's legacy, and the question of tourism]: "The bunkers were just one component of Hoxha's aim to arm the entire country against enemy invaders. Gun training used to be a part of school, I was told, and every family was expected to have a cache of weapons. Soon, Albania became awash in guns and other armaments{{spaced ndash}}and the country is still dealing with that today, not just in its reputation as a center for weapons trading but in its efforts to finally decommission huge stockpiles of ammunition as part of its new NATO obligations."&lt;/ref&gt;

Borrowing and foreign investment were banned under Article 26 of the Constitution, which read: "The granting of concessions to, and the creation of foreign economic and financial companies and other institutions or ones formed jointly with bourgeois and revisionist capitalist monopolies and states as well as obtaining credits from them are prohibited in the People's Socialist Republic of Albania."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biberaj|1986|loc=162n}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bjoerna.dk/dokumentation/Albanian-Constitution-1976.htm|title=The Albanian Constitution of 1976|last=Andersen|first=Bjoern|date=|website=bjoerna.dk|access-date=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoxha said of borrowing money and allowing investment from other countries:
{{Quote
| text = No country whatsoever, big or small, can build socialism by taking credits and aid from the bourgeoisie and the revisionists or by integrating its economy into the world system of capitalist economies. Any such linking of the economy of a socialist country with the economy of bourgeois or revisionist countries opens the doors to the actions of the economic laws of capitalism and the degeneration of the socialist order. This is the road of betrayal and the restoration of capitalism, which the revisionist cliques have pursued and are pursuing.&lt;ref&gt;Hoxha, ''Report on the Activity of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania'', 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

During this period Albania was the most isolated and poorest country in Europe and socially backwards by European standards. It had the lowest standard of living in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Bessemer|2006|pp=54 ,72}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a result of economic self-sufficiency, Albania had a minimal foreign debt. In 1983, Albania imported goods worth $280&amp;nbsp;million but exported goods worth $290&amp;nbsp;million, producing a trade surplus of $10&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;The Directorate of the Intelligence of the Central Intelligence Agency, ''[[The World Factbook]]'' (Washington: [[Government Printing Office]], 1986), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fall of Communism in Albania.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Fall of Hoxha's statue in Tirana's Skanderbeg Square amid student demonstrations]]
In 1981, Hoxha ordered the execution of several party and government officials in a new purge. Prime Minister [[Mehmet Shehu]], the second-most powerful man in Albania and Hoxha's closest comrade-in-arms for 40 years, was reported to have committed suicide in December 1981. He was subsequently condemned as a "traitor" to Albania and was also accused of operating in the service of multiple [[intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]]. It is generally believed that he was either killed or shot himself during a power struggle or over differing foreign policy matters with Hoxha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|pp=198–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Vickers|1999|pp=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Jacques|1995|pp=510–512}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoxha also wrote a large assortment of books during this period, resulting in over 65 volumes of collected works, condensed into six volumes of selected works.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/18/books/the-truest-believer.html?sec=&amp;spon= NYtimes.com] "Hoxha, who died in 1985, was one of the most verbose statesmen of modern times and pressed more than 50 volumes of opinions, diaries and dogma on his long-suffering people, the poorest in Europe."&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Hoxha suffered a heart attack in 1973 from which he never fully recovered. In increasingly precarious health from the late 1970s onward, he turned most state functions over to [[Ramiz Alia]]. In his final days he was confined to a [[wheelchair]] and suffering from [[diabetes]], which had developed in 1948, and [[cerebral ischemia]], from which he had suffered since 1983.  On 9 April 1985, he was struck by [[ventricular fibrillation]]. Over the next forty-eight hours, he had repeated episodes of this arrhythmia, and he died in the early morning of 11 April 1985 at the age of 76.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Jacques|1995|p=520}} "...&amp;nbsp;there was a detailed medical report by a distinguished medical team. Enver Hoxha had suffered since 1948 with diabetes which gradually caused widespread damage to the blood vessels, heart, kidneys and other organs. In 1973, as a consequence of this damage, a myocardial infarction occurred with rhythmic irregularity. During the following years a serious heart disorder developed. On the morning of 9 April 1985, an unexpected ventricular fibrillation occurred. Despite intensive medication, repeated fibrillation and its irreversible consequences in the brain and kidneys caused death at 2:15&amp;nbsp;am on 11 April 1985."&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[Ramiz Alia]].

Hoxha's death left Albania with a legacy of isolation and fear of the outside world. Despite some economic progress made by Hoxha,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|p=186}}: "On the positive side, an objective analysis must conclude that Enver Hoxha's plan to mobilise all of Albania's resources under the regimentation of a central plan was effective and quite successful&amp;nbsp;... Albania was a tribal society, not necessarily primitive but certainly less developed than most. It had no industrial or working class tradition and no experience using modern production techniques. Thus, the results achieved, especially during the phases of initial planning and construction of the economic base were both impressive and positive."&lt;/ref&gt; the country was in [[economic stagnation]]; Albania had been the poorest European country throughout much of the [[Cold War]] period. Following the [[Fall of Communism in Albania|transition to capitalism]] in 1992, Hoxha's legacy diminished, so that by the early 21st century very little of it was still in place in Albania.

== Family ==
[[File:EnverHoxhaHouse.jpg|thumb|Former residence of Enver Hoxha in the secluded area of Blloku (the Block) in Tirana]]
The surname ''Hoxha'' is the Albanian variant of [[Hodja]] (from {{lang-tr|hoca}}), a title given to his ancestors due to their efforts to teach Albanians about [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beepworld.de/members/pashtriku/dossier.htm "Ju Tregoj Pemën e Familjes të Enver Hoxhës", ''Tirana Observer'' 15 June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, among the population, he was widely known by his nickname of ''Dulla'', a short form for the Muslim name Abdullah stemming from his Muslim roots.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Hoxha's parents were Halil and Gjylihan (Gjylo) Hoxha, and Hoxha had three sisters named Fahrije, Haxhire and Sanije. [[Hysen Hoxha]] ({{IPA|[hyˈsɛn ˈhɔdʒa]}}) was Enver Hoxha's uncle and was a militant who campaigned vigorously for the independence of Albania, which occurred when Enver was four years old. His grandfather Beqir was involved in the Gjirokastër section of the [[League of Prizren]].&lt;ref&gt;Pero Zlatar. ''Albanija u eri Envera Hoxhe'' Vol. II. Zagreb: Grafički zavod Hrvatske. 1984. pp. 23–24.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoxha's son Sokol Hoxha was the CEO of the Albanian Post and Telecommunication service and is married to Liliana Hoxha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lilianahoxha.com/ Liliana Hoxha personal website]. 25 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The later democratic president of Albania [[Sali Berisha]] was often seen socializing with Sokol Hoxha and other close relatives of leading communist figures in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albanian.com/v4/showthread.php?t=30610] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326193809/http://www.albanian.com/v4/showthread.php?t=30610 |date=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoxha's daughter, Pranvera, is an [[architect]]. Along with her husband, Klement Kolaneci, she designed the Enver Hoxha Museum in [[Tirana]], a white-tiled [[pyramid]]. Some sources have referred to the edifice, said to be the most expensive ever constructed in Albanian history, as the "Enver Hoxha Mausoleum", though this was not an official appellation. The museum opened in 1988, three years after her father's death, and in 1991 was transformed into a conference centre and exhibition venue renamed [[Pyramid of Tirana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Wheeler|2010|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assassination attempt ==
{{Main article|Banda Mustafaj}}
[[Banda Mustafaj]] was a group of four Albanian émigrés, led by Xhevdet Mustafa, who wanted to assassinate Enver Hoxha in 1982. The gang was connected to counter-revolutionary elements such as the [[Albanian mafia]] and members of the royal [[House of Zogu]]. The plan failed and two of its members were killed and another one was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shqiperia.com/lajme/lajm/nr/9174/Zbulohen-dokumentet-e-CIA-s-dhe-FBI-se-per-Xhevdet-Mustafen|title=Zbulohen dokumentet e CIA-s dhe FBI-se per Xhevdet Mustafen|publisher=Shqiperia.com|accessdate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeriikosoves.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=842:zbuluesi-ushtarak-xhevdet-mustafa-do-vendoste-monarkine&amp;catid=27:dossier&amp;Itemid=31|title=Zbuluesi ushtarak: Xhevdet Mustafa do vendoste monarkinë|publisher=Zeriikosoves.org|accessdate=13 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521131611/http://www.zeriikosoves.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=842:zbuluesi-ushtarak-xhevdet-mustafa-do-vendoste-monarkine&amp;catid=27:dossier&amp;Itemid=31|archivedate=21 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the only real effort to kill Hoxha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lajme4.shqiperia.com/lajme/artikull/iden/1047107151/titulli/Xhevdet-Mustafa-sot-29-vite-nga-zbarkimi-ne-Divjake-zbulohet-biseda-me-kunatin-e-Hazbiut |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710221826/http://lajme4.shqiperia.com/lajme/artikull/iden/1047107151/titulli/Xhevdet-Mustafa-sot-29-vite-nga-zbarkimi-ne-Divjake-zbulohet-biseda-me-kunatin-e-Hazbiut |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 July 2012 |title=Xhevdet Mustafa, sot 29 vite nga zbarkimi në Divjakë, zbulohet biseda me kunatin e Hazbiut Panorama |publisher=Lajme4.shqiperia.com |date=25 September 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lajme4.shqiperia.com/lajme/artikull/iden/1047086512/titulli/Rrefimi-i-Halit-Bajramit-Une-njeriu-i--Hazbiut-ne--banden-e-Xhevdet-Mustafes |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709194428/http://lajme4.shqiperia.com/lajme/artikull/iden/1047086512/titulli/Rrefimi-i-Halit-Bajramit-Une-njeriu-i--Hazbiut-ne--banden-e-Xhevdet-Mustafes |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 July 2012 |title=Rrëfimi i Halit Bajramit: Unë, njeriu i Hazbiut në bandën e Xhevdet Mustafës Panorama |date=12 August 2011 |publisher=Lajme4.shqiperia.com |accessdate=13 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francesc Pi i Margall''' ({{lang-es|Francisco Pi y Margall}}) (29 April 1824 &amp;ndash; 29 November 1901) was a Spanish politician, [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[Federalism|federalist]] and [[libertarian socialist]]&lt;ref&gt;"The first movement of the Spanish workers was strongly influenced by the ideas of Pi i Margall, leader of the Spanish Federalists and disciple of Proudhon. Pi y Margall was one of the outstanding theorists of his time and had a powerful influence on the development of ''libertarian'' ideas in Spain. His political ideas had much in common with those of [[Richard Price]], [[Joseph Priestly]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], and other representatives of the Anglo-American liberalism of the first period. He wanted to limit the power of the state to a minimum and gradually replace it by a ''Socialist'' economic order." [http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/rudolf-rocker-anarchosyndicalism "Anarchosyndicalism" by [[Rudolf Rocker]]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's." George Woodcock. ''Anarchism: a history of libertarian movements''. p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; statesman, historian, and political philosopher and [[romanticism|romanticist]] writer. He was briefly president of the short-lived [[First Spanish Republic]] in 1873.

==Early life==
Pi was the son of a working-class textile worker in [[Barcelona]] and was born on 29 April 1824. Pi's father enrolled him in a religious school in 1831 where he acquired an education in the humanities and the [[classics]]. He was a member of the ''Societat Filomàtica'', enabling him to meet some of the main thinkers and writers of the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[romanticism|romanticist]] movement. In 1837, he left to study law, graduating with a law degree in 1847. He moved to [[Madrid]] that year and began writing as a theater critic for the journal ''El Renacimiento'' and for ''El Correo,''  in which Pi's first political article was published. In need of further income, Pi also took a job for Martí, a [[catalonia|Catalan]] bank.

In 1848, Pi completed the unfinished ''Memories and Beauties of Spain'' by the poet [[Pau Piferrer]], contributing to the sections on [[Catalonia]], [[Seville]], and [[Granada]]. At this time, he connected himself with the Republican faction in Spanish politics. In 1851, he wrote a monumental and highly popular history of painting, though it was eventually condemned by the Church and the Spanish state for heterodoxy.

==Political life under the monarchy==
Pi was involved in the revolution of 1854 that brought the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[caudillo]] [[Baldomero Espartero, Prince of Vergara|Baldomero Espartero, Count of Luchana]] back to power. He published ''La reacción y la revolución'' in that year, influenced by [[G.W.F. Hegel]]'s [[philosophy of history]] and the thinking of the French [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. In 1856 he established a new journal, ''La Razón'', that was closed when the moderate [[Leopoldo O'Donnell, Duke of Tetuan|O'Donnell]] government was overthrown by the [[reactionary]] [[Ramón María Narváez, 1st Duke of Valencia]]. Pi fled to [[Guipúzcoa]] in the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque country]] until 1857, when [[Nicolás María Rivero]] asked him to return to [[Madrid]] to contribute to the Republican newspaper ''La Discusión''. At ''La Discusión'', Pi became acquainted with a number of leaders of the Spanish republican movement, including another future president of the [[First Spanish Republic|First Republic]], [[Estanislau Figueras|Estanislau Figueras i de Moragas]]. In 1864 he became the director of the newspaper.

After the sergeants' revolt at [[San Gil, Spain|San Gil]] in 1866, Pi fled to Paris, where he gave lectures and translated several of Proudhon's works and became familiar with French [[positivism]]. He developed ideas about revolutions and the philosophy of history, including a belief in an inevitable, progressive, and permanent movement in history toward greater freedom, embodied in [[federalism|federal]] constitutions. Throughout his life he would promote republicanism and social objectives through the federal idea.

Pi returned from Paris in 1868 after the success of the [[Glorious Revolution (1868)|Glorious Revolution]]. He was elected deputy on behalf of [[Barcelona]] and was part of the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] that wrote the [[Spanish Constitution of 1869]]. During this time Pi became respected as a leader of the Republican party in the Cortes; he is officially named the head of the party in March 1870. He was replaced shortly thereafter by internal strife over the party's policy toward the [[Paris Commune]], conciliatory policy toward opposition groups, and electoral setbacks. He continued to adamantly promote the establishment of a [[federal republic]] in place of a monarchy. He opposed the liberal monarchy of King [[Amadeo I of Spain]] during its short rule.

==Presidency and later political life==
{{Libertarian socialism |People}}
When the [[First Spanish Republic]] was established in 1873 after the abdication of King Amadeo, the first president, Estanislao Figueras, named Pi Minister of the Interior. During his tenure as Interior Minister, Pi was responsible for the struggle against the ''[[Cantonal Revolution|cantonalist]]'' movement in the provinces. On Figueras's resignation on 11 June, Pi was named [[President of the Government of Spain|president]]. Pi presented to the Cortes an ambitious plan of reform, including a law formalizing a stricter [[separation of church and state]], the reorganization of the army, reduction of the working day to eight hours, regulation of [[child labor]], enhancements to the relationship between business and labor, new laws regarding the autonomy of the regions of Spain, and a program of universal education. His acquaintance with Proudhon enabled Pi to warm relations between the Republicans and the socialists in Spain. However, Pi was unable to rein in the instability of the Republic; on the 1 July, the more radical elements of the Republican party and federalists broke off and declared the government illegitimate, and new insurrections appeared in [[Alcoy, Spain|Alcoy]] and [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] only a week later. Under pressure from the Cortes and many leading Republicans who accused him of dangerous weakness, Pi resigned the presidency on 18 July, only a little more than a month after he assumed the office.

After the end of the Republic in 1874, Pi left political life for a decade. During this time, he returned his attentions to his writings; only a few months after the end of the Republic, he wrote a treatise on its events, ''La República de 1873''. He followed this with ''Las Nacionalidades'' and ''Joyas Literarias'' in 1876. The first volume of his ''Historia General de América'' was published in 1878, ''La Federación'' in 1880, and ''Las luchas de nuestros días'' and ''Observaciones sobre el carácter de don Juan Tenorio'' in 1884. In 1886, he returned to politics and was elected deputy for [[Figueres]], in [[Catalonia]], and again in 1891 and 1893. He was involved in the fragmentation of the Spanish Republican movement in this period together with Estanislao Figueras, [[Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla]], [[Emilio Castelar y Ripoll]], and [[Valentí Almirall]]. Pi was involved in the 1883 Republican [[Congress of Zaragoza]] that proposed a federal republican constitution for Spain; in 1894, he was instrumental in reforming the republican movement with a new manifesto for the Federal Party. In 1890, Pi founded the newspaper ''El Nuevo Régimen'', which campaigned for Cuban independence. Pi's promotion of federalism and regional autonomy earned him popularity among Catalan [[anarchism|anarchists]]. He was also a supporter of [[Iberian Federalism]].

Pi died in Madrid on 29 November 1901.

== Political thought, practice and later influence ==
Pi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish&lt;ref&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: a history of libertarian movements''. p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party. According to [[George Woodcock]], "These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's."&lt;ref&gt;George Woodcock. ''Anarchism: a history of libertarian movements''. p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' "During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi i Margall [[Cantonal Revolution|attempted to establish a decentralized, or “cantonalist,” political system]] on Proudhonian lines."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22753/anarchism/66525/Anarchism-in-Spain#ref539322 "Anarchism" at the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pi i Margall was a dedicated theorist in his own right, especially through book-length works such as ''La reacción y la revolución'' (en:"Reaction and revolution" from 1855), ''Las nacionalidades'' (en:"Nationalities" from 1877), and ''La Federación'' from 1880. For prominent [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Rudolf Rocker]] "The first movement of the Spanish workers was strongly influenced by the ideas of Pi i Margall, leader of the Spanish Federalists and disciple of Proudhon. Pi i Margall was one of the outstanding theorists of his time and had a powerful influence on the development of libertarian ideas in Spain. His political ideas had much in common with those of [[Richard Price]], [[Joseph Priestly]] (sic), [[Thomas Paine]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], and other representatives of the Anglo-American liberalism of the first period. He wanted to limit the power of the state to a minimum and gradually replace it by a Socialist economic order."&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/rudolf-rocker-anarchosyndicalism "Anarchosyndicalism" by [[Rudolf Rocker]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gift wrapping''' is the act of [[Packaging and labelling|enclosing]] a [[gift]] in some sort of material. '''Wrapping paper''' is a kind of [[paper]] designed for gift wrapping. An alternative to gift wrapping is using a gift [[box]] or bag. A wrapped or boxed gift may be held closed with [[ribbon]] and topped with a decorative bow (an ornamental [[knot]] made of ribbon).

==History==
[[File:Chinese hemp paper western han.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hemp]] [[wrapping paper]], China, circa 100 BC.]]
The use of wrapping paper is first documented in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], where paper was invented in 2nd century BC.&lt;ref name="Tsien"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tsien|first=Tsuen-Hsuin |authorlink=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |series=Joseph Needham, Science and Civilisation in China, Chemistry and Chemical Technology |volume= 5 part 1|title=Paper and Printing|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Southern Song]] dynasty, monetary gifts were wrapped with paper, forming an [[envelope]] known as a ''chih pao''. The wrapped gifts were distributed by the Chinese court to government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Needham|title=Science and Civilisation in China: Paper and Printing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx-9mS6Aa4wC&amp;pg=PA122|accessdate=16 April 2013|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-08690-5|page=122|quote=In the Southern Sung dynasty, gift money for bestowing upon officials by the imperial court was wrapped in paper envelopes (chih pao)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Chinese text ''Thien Kung Khai Wu'', Sung Ying-Hsing states that the coarsest wrapping paper is manufactured with rice straws and [[bamboo]] fiber.&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the Hall brothers Rollie and Joyce Hall, founders of [[Hallmark Cards]], did not invent gift wrapping, their innovations led to the development of modern gift wrapping. They helped to popularize the idea of decorative gift wrapping in the 20th century, and according to [[Joyce Hall]], "the decorative gift-wrapping business was born the day Rollie placed those French envelope linings on top of that showcase."&lt;ref name="Regan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Regan|title=Hallmark: A Century of Giving|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwczWM4D9o4C&amp;pg=PA45|date=15 December 2009|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=978-0-7407-9240-3|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology ==
Gift wrapping has been shown to positively influence the recipient who are more likely to rate their gifts positively if they had traditional gift wrapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/129687-why-do-we-wrap-gifts-a-brief-history-of-wrapping-paper|title=Why Do We Wrap Gifts? A Brief History Of Wrapping Paper|last=Feinn|first=Lily|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By culture==
[[File:Gifts xmas.jpg|thumb|left|Gift wrapped presents beneath the Christmas tree]]
===Western cultures===
In Western culture, gifts are often wrapped in wrapping paper and accompanied by a gift note which may note the occasion, the receiver's name and the giver's name.

Modern patterned wrapping paper was introduced to the American market by the [[Hall Brothers]] in 1917.  The Kansas City stationery store had run out of traditional white, red, and green monocolor tissue papers, and started selling colorful envelope liners from France. Proving popular, the company promoted the new designs in the subsequent decades, adding ribbons in the 1930s, and Hallmark remains one of the largest American producers of gift wrap.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2017/12/23/573217009/the-history-of-gift-wrap "The History Of Gift Wrap"]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waste====
In the United States, an additional five million tons of waste are generated over the [[Christmas]] gift-giving period; four million tons of this is wrapping paper and [[shopping bag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleanair.org/Waste/wasteFacts.html |title=Waste Facts and Figures |website=cleanair.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some people attempt to avoid this by unwrapping gifts with care to hopefully allow the paper to be reused, while others use decorated [[cloth]] gift sacks that can be easily reused many times; both of these concepts are part of the [[Green Gifting]] trend that encourages [[recycling]]. Additionally, some people use old newspapers instead of wrapping paper.

===Asian cultures===
In Chinese culture, [[Color in Chinese culture|red wrapping]] denotes luck.

In Japanese culture, wrapping paper and boxes are common. However, the traditional cloth wrapping called ''[[furoshiki]]'' is increasing in popularity, particularly as an [[Environmental movement|ecologically friendly]] alternative to wrapping paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.env.go.jp/en/focus/060403.html Minister Koike created the "Mottainai Furoshiki" as a symbol of Japanese culture to reduce wastes], [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Korean culture, ''[[bojagi]]'' are sometimes used for gift wrapping. A ''yedanbo'' is a ceremonial gift bojagi used to wrap wedding gifts from the bride's family to the members of the groom's.&lt;ref name="koreanet"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080527124028/http://www.korea.net/korea/kor_loca.asp?code=H080406 About Korea - Bojagi], korea.net&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5267">'''Hanitu''' or '''qanitu''' is the [[Bunun people|Bunun]] of [[Taiwan]]'s term for spirit, but it does not exactly equate with terms from other cultures, and is one of three domains of Bunun spiritual thought, another being ''isang'', which equates more to the soul, breath, and heart.&lt;ref name="anu"/&gt;  It may refer to the spirit of any living creature as well as forms animate or not, such as land, rocks, plants, animals, and humans.&lt;ref name="nccu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nccur.lib.nccu.edu.tw/bitstream/140.119/38946/10/92402210.pdf|format=PDF|title=Chapter 3 - The Bunun People|website=Nccur.lib.nccu.edu|accessdate=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All objects contained ''hanitu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rdbusser.com/pub/DeBusser2009TowardsAGrammarOfTakivatanBunun%5BFinalVers_20091027_Online%5D.pdf|format=PDF|title=Towards a grammar of Takivatan Bunun Selected Topics|author=Rik L.J. De Busser|website=Rdbusser.com|accessdate=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; n Malay and Indonesian, the term for ghost, ''hantu'', may be of related origin.

As opposed to other religions and belief systems, multiple spirits can exist in one object/creature, as in the case of humans.  They believed bad souls brought illness.  With the adoption of Christianity these terms changed, with ''makuang'' being equated to ''devil''.&lt;ref name="nccu"/&gt;  Nevertheless, some scholars believe the native concepts were not replaced, but rather Christian thought was ''added on''.&lt;ref name="anu"/&gt;  Strength of hanitu were innate.

==Etymology==
''Hanitu'' or ''hanidu'' is derived from [[Proto-Austronesian]] ''*qaNiCu'' ("ghost", "spirit of the dead"). In other [[Austronesian people|Austronesian cultures]], [[cognate]]s of ''hanitu'' include the  [[Filipino people|Filipino]] and [[Tao people|Tao]] ''[[anito]]'', [[Malaysian people|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian people|Indonesian]] ''[[Hantu Demon|hantu]]'' or ''antu'', [[Polynesian people|Polynesian]] ''[[aitu]]'' and ''[[aitu]]'', and [[Micronesian people|Micronesian]] ''aniti''.&lt;ref name="funk"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leberecht Funk|editor = Y. Musharbash &amp; G.H. Presterudstuen |title =Monster Anthropology in Australasia and Beyond|chapter =Entanglements between Tao People and Anito on Lanyu Island, Taiwan|publisher =Palgrave Macmillan|year =2014|pages=143-159|isbn =9781137448651|url =https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9781137448651_9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Hanitu==
* Left or right spirits of people. 
* Wandering spirits 
* Spirits of land and objects that predated humans
* Ancestral spirits
* Agitator spirits
&lt;ref name="anu"/&gt;

===Land Hanitu===
The land contained spirits before human habitation, and governed hunting, agriculture, and inhabitation.  There were human spirit mediums who communicated with these formless ''hanitu''.&lt;ref name="anu"/&gt;

===Hanitu of Objects===
Objects, such as guns, had formless ''hanitu''.  The ''hanitu'' of such objects were 'invited' by ritual to take lives of animals and people.  It was believed a person could not force a gun to take a life, that it was the work of the ''hanitu'' of the gun.  If the killing was not intentional, the shooter was not seen as guilty, rather the gun itself was evil, and would be buried.&lt;ref name="anu"/&gt;

===Of people===
Human hanitu came from the father.  There was a formless hanitu on each shoulder, as well as an ''isang'' or soul in the middle of the chest.  The ''isang'' was unrelated to the parents.  The Bunun believed that each person had two spirits, one good/amicable/communal (''masial'') one bad/irritable/self-serving (''makuang''), but the ultimate arbiter was the ''isang''/soul, which grew stronger with maturity and taboo observance.  These would leave after death, and could act independently of the person's will, and could cause conflict or indecisiveness.  The hanitu left the body during dreams, and could communicate with other hanitu during dreams (incl. objects).&lt;ref name="anu"/&gt;

===Of ancestors===
''Hanitu'' of ancestors depended upon how descendents treated them during life.  Violent death could cause wandering spirits.&lt;ref name="anu"/&gt;  These ''hanitu'' were fed but not worshipped.

===No abode spirits===
''Hanitu'' with no set abode were malevolent spirits that have specific forms, and could produce objects such as bamboo needles to stab people and cause disease, or scare out the soul (isang) from a person, who would then die if the soul was gone too long.  Qanasilis were giant spirits, Mamantainga were big-eared spirits with giant torsos who like to eat children.  Spirit mediatiors could negotiate ''palinanutu hanitu'' with agitators to heal disease.&lt;ref name="anu"/&gt;

==Death==
''Hanitu'' were believed to dwell in a homeland to the west, named ''Lamungan'' or ''Mai-asang'', to which they returned upon the death of an animate being.&lt;ref name="anu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/104114/1/Fang%20Thesis%202016.pdf|format=PDF|title=Transforming Tradition in Eastern Taiwan : Bunun Incorporation of Christianity in their Spirit Relationships|website=Openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au|accessdate=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ippaso di Metaponto.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Hippasus of Metapontum as imagined in a XIX century depiction]]
'''Hippasus of [[Metapontum]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɪ|p|ə|s|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἵππασος ὁ Μεταποντῖνος}}, ''Híppasos''; fl. 5th century BC), was a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] [[philosopher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Iamblichus |edition=1918 translation |title=The life of Pythagoras |year=1918 |url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofpythagoras00iamb |page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about his life or his beliefs, but he is sometimes credited with the discovery of the existence of [[irrational numbers]]. The discovery of irrational numbers is said to have been shocking to the Pythagoreans, and Hippasus is supposed to have drowned at sea, apparently as a punishment from the [[Greek gods|gods]] for divulging this. However, the few ancient sources which describe this story either do not mention Hippasus by name (e.g. Pappus)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/pappus/PappusBookX.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively tell that Hippasus drowned because he revealed how to construct a [[dodecahedron]] inside a [[sphere]]. The discovery of irrationality is not specifically ascribed to Hippasus by any ancient writer. Some modern scholars though have suggested that he discovered the irrationality of [[Square root of 2|{{radic|2}}]], which is believed to have been discovered around the time that he lived.

==Life==
Little is known about the life of Hippasus. He may have lived in the late 5th century BC, about a century after the time of [[Pythagoras]]. [[Metapontum]] in [[Italy]] ([[Magna Graecia]]) is usually referred to as his birthplace,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0052:book=1:section=984a&amp;highlight=Hippasus%2CMetapontum|title=Aristotle, Metaphysics I.3: 984a7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tufts1"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D6|title=Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers VIII,84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], ''Physica'' 23.33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] I.5.5 (Dox. 292)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Protrepticus (Clement)|Protrepticus]] 64.2&lt;/ref&gt; although according to Iamblichus some claim Metapontum to be his birthplace, while others the nearby city of [[Crotone|Croton]].&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vita Pythagorica'', 18 (81)&lt;/ref&gt; Hippasus is recorded under the city of [[Sybaris]] in [[Iamblichus]] list of each city's Pythagoreans.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, Vita Pythagorica, 34 (267)&lt;/ref&gt; He also states that Hippasus was the founder of a sect of the Pythagoreans called the [[Pythagoreanism#Two schools|''Mathematici'']] ({{lang|grc|μαθηματικοί}}) in opposition to the [[Pythagoreanism#Two schools|''Acusmatici'']] ({{lang|grc|ἀκουσματικοί}});&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''De Communi Mathematica Scientia'', 76&lt;/ref&gt; but elsewhere he makes him the founder of the ''Acusmatici'' in opposition to the ''Mathematici''.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vita Pythagorica'', 18 (81); cf. Iamblichus, ''In Nic.'' 10.20; ''De anima'' ap. [[Stobaeus]], i.49.32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iamblichus]] says about the death of Hippasus
:''It is related to Hippasus that he was a Pythagorean, and that, owing to his being the first to publish and describe the [[dodecahedron|sphere from the twelve pentagons]], he perished at sea for his impiety, but he received credit for the discovery, though really it all belonged to HIM (for in this way they refer to Pythagoras, and they do not call him by his name).''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Iamblichus |editor1-first=Thomas |title=On the Pythagorean Life |date=1939 |page=88 |chapter=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Iamblichus (ca. 245-325 AD, 1918 translation) in ''The life of Pythagoras'', by [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Iamblichus |title=The life of Pythagoras |year=1918 |url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofpythagoras00iamb}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''There were also two forms of philosophy, for the two genera of those that pursued it: the ''Acusmatici'' and the ''Mathematici''. The latter are acknowledged to be Pythagoreans by the rest but the Mathematici do not admit that the Acusmatici derived their instructions from Pythagoras but from Hippasus. The philosophy of the Acusmatici consisted in auditions unaccompanied with demonstrations and a reasoning process; because it merely ordered a thing to be done in a certain way and that they should endeavor to preserve such other things as were said by him, as divine dogmas. Memory was the most valued faculty. All these auditions were of three kinds; some signifying what a thing is; others what it especially is, others what ought or ought not to be done.'' (p. 61)

==Doctrines==
[[Aristotle]]  speaks of Hippasus as holding the element of [[fire (classical element)|fire]] to be the cause of all things;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0052:book=1:section=984a&amp;highlight=Hippasus%2Cfire|title=Aristotle, Metaphysics (English translation)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sextus Empiricus]] contrasts him with the Pythagoreans in this respect, that he believed the ''[[arche]]'' to be material, whereas they thought it was incorporeal, namely, number.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''ad Phys.'' i. 361&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diogenes Laërtius]] tells us that Hippasus believed that "there is a definite time which the changes in the universe take to complete, and that the universe is limited and ever in motion."&lt;ref name="tufts1"/&gt; According to one statement, Hippasus left no writings,&lt;ref name="tufts1"/&gt; according to another he was the author of the ''Mystic Discourse'', written to bring [[Pythagoras]] into disrepute.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D1&amp;highlight=Hippasus|title=Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, viii. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[scholium]] on [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'' notes him as an early experimenter in [[music theory]], claiming that he made use of [[bronze]] disks to discover the fundamental musical ratios, 4:3, 3:2, and 2:1.&lt;ref&gt;Scholium on Plato's ''Phaedo'', 108d&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irrational numbers===
Hippasus is sometimes credited with the discovery of the existence of [[irrational numbers]], following which he was [[drown]]ed at sea. Pythagoreans preached that all numbers could be expressed as the ratio of integers, and the discovery of irrational numbers is said to have shocked them. However, the evidence linking the discovery to Hippasus is confused.

[[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] merely says that the knowledge of irrational numbers originated in the Pythagorean school, and that the member who first divulged the secret perished by drowning.&lt;ref&gt;Pappus, ''Commentary on Book X of Euclid's Elements''. A similar story is quoted in a Greek [[scholium]] to the tenth book.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iamblichus]] gives a series of inconsistent reports. In one story he explains how a Pythagorean was merely expelled for divulging the nature of the irrational; but he then cites the legend of the Pythagorean who drowned at sea for making known the construction of the regular [[dodecahedron]] in the [[sphere]].&lt;ref name="iamblichus246"&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vita Pythagorica'', 34 (246)&lt;/ref&gt; In another account he tells how it was Hippasus who drowned at sea for betraying the construction of the dodecahedron and taking credit for this construction himself;&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vita Pythagorica'', 18 (88), ''De Communi Mathematica Scientia'', 25&lt;/ref&gt; but in another story this same punishment is meted out to the Pythagorean who divulged knowledge of the irrational.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vita Pythagorica'', 34 (247)&lt;/ref&gt; Iamblichus clearly states that the drowning at sea was a punishment from the [[Greek gods|gods]] for impious behaviour.&lt;ref name="iamblichus246"/&gt;

These stories are usually taken together to ascribe the discovery of irrationals to Hippasus, but whether he did or not is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur Richard Knorr (1975), ''The Evolution of the Euclidean Elements: A Study of the Theory of Incommensurable Magnitudes and its Significance for Early Greek Geometry'', pages 21-2, 50-1. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; In principle, the stories can be combined, since it is possible to discover irrational numbers when constructing dodecahedrons. Irrationality, by infinite reciprocal subtraction, can be easily seen in the [[Golden ratio]] of the regular [[pentagon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]] (1972), ''Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism'', page 459. Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern scholars prefer to credit Hippasus with the discovery of the irrationality of [[Square root of 2|{{radic|2}}]]. [[Plato]] in his ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Theaetetus'', 147d ff&lt;/ref&gt; describes how [[Theodorus of Cyrene]] (c. 400 BC) proved the irrationality of {{radic|3}}, {{radic|5}}, etc. up to {{radic|17}}, which implies that an earlier mathematician had already proved the irrationality of {{radic|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. L. Heath|Thomas Heath]] (1921) ''A History of Greek Mathematics, Volume 1, From Thales to Euclid'', p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] referred to the method for a proof of the irrationality of {{radic|2}},&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Prior Analytics'', I-23&lt;/ref&gt; and a full proof along these same lines is set out in the proposition interpolated at the end of [[Euclid]]'s Book X,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Heath (1921) ''A History of Greek Mathematics, Volume 1, From Thales to Euclid'', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that the proof was certainly ancient.&lt;ref name="heath168"&gt;Thomas Heath (1921) ''A History of Greek Mathematics, Volume 1, From Thales to Euclid'', p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; The method is a proof by contradiction, or [[reductio ad absurdum]], which shows that, if the diagonal of a [[Square (geometry)|square]] is assumed to be [[commensurability (mathematics)|commensurable]] with the side, then the same number must be both odd and even.&lt;ref name="heath168"/&gt;

In the hands of modern writers this combination of vague ancient reports and modern guesswork has sometimes evolved into a much more emphatic and colourful tale. Some writers have Hippasus making his discovery while on board a ship, as a result of which his Pythagorean shipmates toss him overboard;&lt;ref&gt;[[Morris Kline]] (1990), ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'', page 32. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; while one writer even has [[Pythagoras]] himself "to his eternal shame" sentencing Hippasus to death by drowning, for showing "that {{radic|2}} is an irrational number."&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Singh]] (1998), ''[[Fermat's Enigma]]'', p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jamie Whyte''' is a New Zealand politician who is a former leader of [[ACT New Zealand]], a [[free market]] political party of New Zealand, and unsuccessfully contested the [[Pakuranga (New Zealand electorate)|Pakuranga electorate]] in the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|2014 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/election-2014/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503581&amp;objectid=11195810 | title=Act leader set to play it straight | newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=3 February 2014 | accessdate=3 February 2014 | author=Young, Audrey}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the election, Whyte held the first position on the party list, but Act did not achieve enough party votes to secure any list seats.&lt;ref name="JamieWhyte"&gt;Act. [http://www.act.org.nz/jamie-whyte "Jamie Whyte"], ''[[Act New Zealand]]'', 27 October 2005. Retrieved on 18 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the 2014 general election, he resigned from the leadership of ACT.&lt;ref name="Whyte resigns"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10576531/ACTs-Jamie-Whyte-quits-as-leader | title=ACT's Jamie Whyte quits as leader | work=Stuff | date=3 October 2014 | accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whyte is a former philosophy lecturer, currency trader and management consultant. He has written books and newspaper columns about reasoning and politics.

== Early life and academia ==
Whyte was born in [[Auckland, New Zealand]]. He received his undergraduate degree from the [[University of Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11195695 | title=Jamie Whyte elected Act leader | newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=2 February 2014 | accessdate=18 September 2014 | author=Young, Audrey}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to the UK to study for an M.Phil and Ph.D at [[St John's College, Cambridge]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Upon graduation, Whyte remained at Cambridge University for three years as a research fellow at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi College]] and temporarily lectured in the Philosophy faculty. He won the ''Analysis'' journal prize for the best article by a philosopher under the age of 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://philosophynow.org/issues/101/News_March_April_2014|title = Philosopher becomes party leader|last = Roberts|first = Sue|date = March 2014|journal = Philosophy Now|accessdate = 18 September 2014|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Whyte then took up a job with the New York-based management consultancy firm [[Oliver Wyman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lse.ac.uk/publicEvents/events/2011/20110726t1830vOT.aspx|title=Keynes v Hayek |date= 8 August 2011| publisher=London School of Economics}}
&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked as a foreign currency trader.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Writing and media==
Since 2004, Whyte has written books for general audiences and newspaper columns, aiming to expose shoddy reasoning, especially by politicians. In 2006 he won the [[Reason Foundation]] Bastiat Prize for journalism (jointly with Tim Harford of the ''[[Financial Times]]'') and in 2010 he was named runner up.&lt;ref&gt;Previous Bastiat Prize Winners from [http://reason.org/news/show/1012830.html Reason Foundation], accessed June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, Whyte won the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] Arthur Seldon Memorial Award for Excellence for ''Quack Policy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.iea.org.uk/in-the-media/press-release/political-party-leader-wins-prestigious-seldon-award|title = Political party leader wins prestigious Seldon Award|last = |first = |date = 27 June 2014|work = |accessdate = 18 Sep 2014|publisher = IEA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author of ''Crimes Against Logic'' (titled ''Bad Thoughts: A Guide to Clear Thinking'' in the UK; 2004), ''A Load of Blair'' (2005), ''Free Thoughts'' (2012) and ''Quack Policy'' (2013) and has also written columns for many notable publications, including ''[[The Times]]'', [[City A.M.|City A.M]]., [[Standpoint (magazine)|Standpoint]], ''Financial Times'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Whyte has also occasionally broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] and television.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

== Political career ==
In his youth, Whyte was a campaign volunteer for [[Bob Jones (New Zealand)|Bob Jones]]' [[New Zealand Party]] in the [[New Zealand general election, 1984|1984 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11283858|title=Leaders' first trip to ballot box|author=Cherie Howie|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite no prior experience in political office, at a board meeting in February 2014, Whyte was elected to the ACT party's leadership, beating former MP, [[John Boscawen]]. At the same meeting, [[David Seymour (politician)|David Seymour]] was chosen as ACT's candidate for the [[Epsom (New Zealand electorate)|Epsom electorate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/ACT-choices-huge-risk-for-party/tabid/1607/articleID/330702/Default.aspx|title=ACT choices huge risk for party|author=Sabin |date= 2 February 2014| publisher=3 News|first = Brook}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kenneth Wang was later elected as Whyte's deputy leader in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9944101/Kenneth-Wang-elected-Act-deputy-leader|title = Kenneth Wang elected Act deputy leader|last = Dastgheib|first = Shabnam|date = 15 April 2014|work = |accessdate = 18 Sep 2014|publisher = Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2014 general election, ACT only won enough votes to be represented by David Seymour in the [[Epsom (New Zealand electorate)|Epsom electorate]]. After the election, on 3 October 2014 Whyte resigned from the leadership of the party, saying: "Clearly, I make this announcement with regret, however the election result is clear, and I must now turn to my career and my family." He was replaced as ACT leader by David Seymour on the day of his resignation.&lt;ref name="Whyte resigns"/&gt;

In February 2017, Whyte joined the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] as Director of Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IEA appoints new Director of Research &amp; a new Chief Economist|url=https://iea.org.uk/media/institute-of-economic-affairs-unveils-major-new-appointments/|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whyte's political philosophy is [[classical liberalism]], in the tradition of [[Friedrich Hayek]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayek vs Keynes at the LSE (Cobden Centre), accessed June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3650">'''Jevrem Jezdić''' (March 13, 1916 – December 9, 1997) was a [[Serbia]]n historian, publicist and writer. Most of his books were not published in Serbian. [[File:Jevrem Jezdic.JPG|thumb|alt=A Jevrem Jezdic|Jevrem Jezdić in 1947]]

==Biography==

Jezdić was born in [[Polača]], at the time in [[Austria-Hungary]], today’s [[Croatia]].

At the end of the 1950s Jezdić illegally fled to the [[USSR]] together with his wife and daughter, as a part of the so-called "[[informbiro]]" emigration. As a sympathizer of [[Joseph Stalin]] he was forced to escape to avoid persecution. When he arrived in [[Moscow]], he was arrested under the allegation that he was a spy of the Communistic Party of [[Yugoslavia]]. He spent three months in the notorious prison [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka]] in [[Moscow]]. He was released thanks to the initiative of some influential members of the [[NKVD]] secret police. Ana Jezdić, his wife, spent more than five months in the prison. Her health was greatly damaged in the prison, so she died by the end of 1951 from pneumonia. Jezdić remained a true communist, but he never forgave the [[USSR]] authorities for the death of his wife.

He died in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].

==Philosophical work of Jevrem Jezdić==

During his long carrier, Jezdić wrote several dozens of philosophical discussions, of which only a few were published. Criticism of the authorities was one of his dominant motives. One of his crucial works is a discussion entitled, "Instead of the Law", which has an idealistic view on anarchism. It was published only in French. 
One of Jezdić's early role-models was the Russian revolutionist and philosopher [[Mikhail Bakunin]], because of his tempestuous life.
The most colorful character from Jezdić’s novel "Contempt" is a mysterious old man Aleksei Krinkop, who shouts: "Where authorities exist, freedom is gone", which is a motto of several anarchistic groups. This character was based upon the Russian philosopher, historian, and writer [[Peter Kropotkin]]. Jezdić also wrote the analysis of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], and the [[Russian revolution of 1905]].

'''Joseph Bédier''' (28 January 1864 – 29 August 1938) was a French writer and scholar and historian of medieval France.

==Biography==
Bédier was born in [[Paris]], France to Adolphe Bédier, a lawyer of [[Brittany|Breton]] origin, and spent his childhood in [[Réunion]]. He was a professor of medieval French literature at the [[Université de Fribourg]], [[Switzerland]] (1889–1891) and the [[Collège de France]], Paris (c. 1893).

Modern theories of the ''[[fabliaux]]'' and the ''[[chansons de geste]]'' are based on two of Bédier's studies.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Bédier revived interest in several important old French texts, including ''[[Le roman de Tristan et Iseut]]'' (1900), ''[[La chanson de Roland]]'' (1921), and ''[[Les fabliaux]]'' (1893). He was a member of the [[Académie française]] from 1920 until his death.

His ''Tristan et Iseut'' was translated into [[Cornish language|Cornish]] by [[A. S. D. Smith]], into [[English language|English]] by [[Hilaire Belloc]] and [[Paul Rosenfeld]], and into [[German language|German]] by [[Rudolf G. Binding]]. In 2013, a new English translation by Edward J. Gallagher was published by Hackett Publishing Company.

Bédier was also joint editor of the two-volume ''[[Littérature française]]'', one of the most valuable modern general histories of French literature. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1929.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bédier died in [[Le Grand-Serre]], France. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Military diaries===
Bédier used the [[diary|diaries]] (''Kriegstagebücher'') of [[German people|German]] soldiers of different [[military rank]]s in [[World War I]] as a source for various articles dealing with what he describes as [[war crime|atrocities]] inflicted upon [[Belgian people|Belgian]] civilians and French soldiers. Some of these diaries had been kept for military reasons: in order to provide daily accounts of troop movements, orders, engagements, losses etc. Others were private diaries. From them Bédier connected together accounts of thirty-six incidents of what he saw as [[sexual crime|sexual]] and [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] crimes by the German soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Horne, John, and Alan Kramer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8008">A '''''Lex Julia''''' (or: '''Lex Iulia''', plural: '''Leges Juliae'''/'''Leges Iuliae''') is an [[Roman law|ancient Roman law]] that was introduced by any member of the [[Julii|Julian family]]. Most often, "Julian laws", ''Lex Iulia'' or ''Leges Iuliae'' refer to moral legislation introduced by [[Augustus]] in 23 BC, or to a law from the [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]] of [[Julius Caesar]].

== Lex Iulia de Civitate Latinis et Sociis Danda (90 BC) ==
Apart from Augustus's laws on marriage, this 90 BC Lex Julia is probably the best known of the laws under this name. It was introduced by the consul [[Lucius Julius Caesar (consul 90 BC)|Lucius Julius Caesar]]. It granted [[Roman citizenship]] to all citizens of [[Italic people|Italic]] towns which had not raised arms against Rome in the [[Social War (91–88 BC)]]. This war was a rebellion against Rome by some of her Italic [[socii]] (allies) which was caused by Rome's refusal to grant them Roman citizenship. During the war, the Roman introduced this law which granted Roman citizenship to those who had not taken part in the war (especially [[Etruria]] and [[Umbria]]) to prevent them from joining the rebellion. The next year, the Romans introduced the [[Lex Plautia Papiria|de Civitate Sociis Danda]], which granted Roman citizenship to the allies which had rebelled, in an attempt to stem the rebellion. &lt;ref&gt;Pallottino, M., A History of Earliest Italy, Routledge Revivals, (2014), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lex Iulia de Repetundis (59 BC) ==
This law restricted the number of 'gifts' that a [[Roman governor|governor]] could receive during his term in a [[Roman province|province]], and also ensured that governors balanced their accounts before leaving a province.

== Lex Iulia Municipalis (45 BC) ==
Sets regulations for the Italian municipalities. See [[Tables of Heraclea]].

== Moral legislation of Augustus (18–17 BC)==
Under Augustus, the ''Leges Juliae'' of 18–17 BC attempted to elevate both the morals and the numbers of the upper classes in Rome and to increase the population by encouraging marriage and having children (''Lex Julia de maritandis ordinibus''). They also established [[Marriage in ancient Rome#Adultery|adultery]] as a private and public crime (''Lex Julia de adulteriis'').

To encourage population expansion, the Leges Juliae offered inducements to marriage and imposed disabilities upon the [[celibate]]. Augustus instituted the "Law of the three sons" which held those in high regard who produced three male&lt;ref&gt;"The Romans: From Village to Empire: A History of Rome from Earliest Times to the End of the Western Empire" by M. Boatwright, et al. 2nd edition. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; offspring. Marrying-age celibates and young widows who wouldn't marry were prohibited from receiving inheritances and from attending public games.

===Augustan ''Leges Iuliae''===
* ''Lex Iulia de Ambitu'' (18 BC): Penalising bribery when acquiring political offices.
* ''Lex Iulia de Maritandis Ordinibus'' (18 BC): Limiting marriage across social class boundaries (and thus seen as an indirect foundation of [[concubinage]], later regulated by [[Justinian]], see also below).
*''Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis'' (17 BC): This law punished  adultery with banishment.&lt;ref name="UNRV History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrv.com/government/julianmarriage.php |title=The Julian marriage laws |publisher=Unrv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two guilty parties were sent to different islands ("dummodo in ''diversas'' insulas relegentur"), and part of their property was confiscated.&lt;ref name="UNRV History" /&gt; Fathers were permitted to kill daughters and their partners in adultery.&lt;ref name="Woolf2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&amp;dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=18BCE+flagrante|year=2007|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Husbands could kill the partners under certain circumstances and were required to divorce adulterous wives.&lt;ref name="Woolf2007"/&gt; Augustus himself was obliged to invoke the law against his own daughter, [[Julia the Elder|Julia]] (relegated to the island of [[Pandateria]]) and against her eldest daughter ([[Julia the Younger]]). [[Tacitus]] adds the reproach that Augustus was stricter for his own relatives than the law actually required (''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' III 24)
* ''[[Inheritance tax#Ancient Rome|Lex Iulia de vicesima hereditatum]]'' (5 AD): (on [[inheritance tax]]) instituted a 5 percent tax on testamentary inheritances, exempting close relatives.
* ''[[Lex Papia Poppaea]]'' (9 AD):  (to encourage and strengthen marriage) is usually seen as an integral part of Augustus' [[Julian Laws]]. The ''Lex Papia Poppaea'' also explicitly promoted offspring (within lawful marriage), thus also discriminating against celibacy.

==Later updates to the Julian laws==
The extracts below are from later legal codes and textbooks, but are also valuable in the sense that they are based on, and frequently quote from, the actual text of Augustus' laws.

===Ulpian (3rd century)===
As written down by [[Ulpian]]
;The Lex Julia relating to marriage: (''[[Epitome]]'' 13-14) By the terms of the Lex Julia, senators and their descendants are forbidden to marry freedwomen, or women who have themselves followed the profession of the stage, or whose father or mother has done so; other freeborn persons are forbidden to marry a common prostitute, or a procuress, or a woman manumitted by a procurer or procuress, or a woman caught in adultery, or one condemned in a public lawsuit, or one who has followed the profession of the stage....

===Justinian (6th century)===
Under the rule of [[Emperor Justinian]]
;The Lex Julia on adultery: (''[[Institutes of Justinian|Institutes]]'' 4, 18, 2-3) Public prosecutions are as follows....the Lex Julia for the suppression of adultery punishes with death not only those who dishonour the marriage bed of another but also those who indulge in unspeakable lust with males. The same Lex Julia also punishes the offence of seduction, when a person, without the use of force, deflowers a virgin or seduces a respectable widow. The penalty imposed by the statute on such offenders is the confiscation of half their estate if they are of respectable standing, corporal punishment and banishment in the case of people of the lower orders.

:(''[[Pandects|Digest]]'' 4, 4, 37) But as regards the provisions of the Lex Julia....a man who confesses that he has committed the offence [i.e. adultery] has no right to ask for a remission of the penalty on the ground that he was under age; nor, as I have said, will any remission be allowed if he commits any of those offences which the statute punishes in the same way as adultery; as, for example, if he marries a woman who is detected in adultery and he declines to divorce her, or where he makes a profit from her adultery, or accepts a bribe to conceal illicit intercourse which he detects, or lends his house for the commission of adultery or illicit intercourse within it; youth, as I said, is no excuse in the face of clear enactments, when a man who, though he appeals to the law, himself transgresses it.

'''Mauro Ceruti''' (born July 16, 1953 in [[Cremona, Italy]]) is an Italian philosopher.

He is one of the pioneers and developers of Complex Systems Theories, Methods and Epistemologies, and of the trans-disciplinary research line usually called “Complex Thinking”, which aims at the innovation of the paradigms of (scientific) rationality.

Ceruti’s philosophical reflections and productions are at the intersection between a plurality of research domains, among which they stimulate inter- and trans-disciplinary debate on complexity: Epistemology (Philosophy and History of Science, History of Ideas, Noology,…), Natural Sciences (Physics, Biology, Cosmology, …), Human Sciences (Anthropology, Sociology, Psychology, History, …), Sciences of Organization and Management, among others.

His writings have been published in Italian, English, French, German, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, and Turkish.

== Research profile ==
Mauro Ceruti studied Philosophy at the [[University of Milan]] (Italy) with Ludovico Geymonat, focusing on Philosophy and History of Science, and, in particular, on Jean Piaget’s Genetic Epistemology. In this period, Ceruti produced on the latter topic an in-depth study and interpretation, which was published later in a book that he wrote together with [[Gianluca Bocchi]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Bocchi,M. Ceruti, Disordine e costruzione, Feltrinelli, Milano 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1981 to 1986 Ceruti worked at the University of Geneva, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, and at the Genetic Epistemology International Centre founded by Jean Piaget. In these years, he developed the definition of an innovative research line within Philosophy of Science, based on analyses and elaborations of the epistemological implications of the Evolutionary Sciences. Within this framework, Ceruti developed a research program in Evolutionary Epistemology that draws on contemporary theories of biological evolution, history of ideas and genetic psychology.

Starting from the 80s, Ceruti had been collaborating with Alberto Munari and Donata Fabbri at the Cultural Psychology Center of Geneva, Ilya Prigogine at Université Libre of Brussels, Henri Atlan and Francisco Varela at CREA (Research Center in Applied Epistemology, Paris), Jean-Louis Le Moigne at the MCX (Modelisation of Complexity) Program, and Ervin Laszlo and GERG (General Evolution Research Group, San Diego).

Between 1986 and 1993, Ceruti started to collaborate with Edgar Morin at the CETSAP (Research Center in Transdisciplinary Studies, Sociology, Anthropology, Politics, Paris), developing and expanding his Evolutionary Epistemology project to create a new trans-disciplinary research program, dedicated to structure an Anthropology and Epistemology of Complex Systems, as well as a Complex Anthropology and Epistemology.

Since 1985 Ceruti has been organizing a series of symposia, as well as structuring a wide research network on the main research topics of the emerging Sciences of Complex Systems. They included, besides the already mentioned pioneers of these domains of inquiry, also Jerome Bruner, Heinz von Foerster, Ernst von Glasersfeld, Susan Oyama, Isabelle Stengers, William Thompson, Lynn Margulis, James Lovelock, Stephen J. Gould, Niles Eldredge, Brian Goodwin, Evan Thompson, Giulio Giorello, Paul Feyerabend, Paul Watzlawick, and René Thom, among others. These collaborations and synergies found their expression in collective publications,&lt;ref&gt;L'altro Piaget. Strategie delle genesi, Emme Edizioni, Milano, 1983, with G. Bocchi, D. Fabbri, A. Munari; Dopo Piaget. Aspetti teorici e prospettive per l’educazione, Edizioni Lavoro, Roma, 1985, with D. Fabbri e A. Munari; La sfida della complessità, with G. Bocchi, Feltrinelli, Milano, 1985, Bruno Mondadori, Milano, 2007; Physis. Abitare la Terra, Feltrinelli, Milano, 1988, with E. Laszlo, Evoluzione e cognizione. L’eredità dell’epistemologia genetica di Jean Piaget, Lubrina, Bergamo, 1990; Che cos’è la conoscenza, Laterza, Roma-Bari, 1990, with L. Preta,  Epistemologia e psicoterapia, Raffaello Cortina, Milano, 1998, with G. Lo Verso; Le radici prime dell'Europa. Gli intrecci genetici, linguistici, storici, Bruno Mondadori, Milano, 2000, with G. Bocchi; Le origini della scrittura. Genealogie di un’invenzione, Bruno Mondadori, Milano, 2001, with G. Bocchi)&lt;/ref&gt; among which is ''La sfida della complessità''.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bocchi, M. Ceruti, La sfida della complessità, Mondadori, Milano, 2007 (2nd edition)&lt;/ref&gt;  This work, edited by Ceruti with Gianluca Bocchi, initiated in Italy one of the most relevant philosophical debates of the last decades, and, at the international level, contributed to connect innovative lines of inquiry within the Sciences of Complex Systems in a unitary trans-disciplinary research direction that, since the late 80s, is commonly called “Epistemology of Complex Systems”. Together with Ceruti’s following books, this work stimulated epistemological reflections on the paradigms of contemporary sciences, and the emergence of new research perspectives in many different disciplines and social practices: from Architecture to Sociology and Anthropology, from Clinical Psychology to Management and Organization Sciences, from Educational Sciences to the Cognitive Sciences and Philosophy of Mind, from History to the Sciences of Globalization.

Between the 80s and the 90s Ceruti founded and directed three scientific journals dedicated to the development of “Complex Thinking”: ''La Casa di Dedalo, Oikos'' and ''Pluriverso.''

Since 1994 Ceruti has been Professor in the domain of Epistemology and Philosophy of Science in different Italian universities: the University of Parma, the Polytechnic of Milan, the University of Palermo, the Bicocca University of Milan, the University of Bergamo (where he founded the Research Center on Complex Systems CERCO, as well as a Doctoral School in Anthropology and Epistemology of Complex Systems), and the IULM University of Milan.

Currently he is member of the following Scientific Committees and Advisory Boards:

'''Very Rev. Michelangelo Tamburini, S.J.''' (27 September 1648 – 28 February 1730) was an Italian [[Jesuit]], who was elected fourteenth [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus]] from January 31, 1706 to February 28, 1730.

[[Image:MTamburini.jpg|left|thumb|Very Rev. Michelangelo Tamburini, S.J.]]
After having taught [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophy and theology for twelve years, he was successively made rector of several colleges, was chosen by Cardinal Reynold of Este as his private theologian, held the offices of secretary general and vicar to [[Thyrsus Gonzalez]], and finally, on the latter's death, was elected general on 3 January 1706, a post which he occupied for 24 years.

The reputation for solid virtue, patience, and courage, which he had acquired in the different grades of his order, was by no means dimmed in the long years of his generalate. During Tamburini's superiorship, the apostolic activity of the Society was at its best; but, at the same time, could be seen signs of the storm which was, half a century later, to annihilate it.

The Reductions of Paraguay were beginning to bear fruit; missionaries were laying down their lives for the pest-stricken in the Levant or were pushing into the steppes of [[Tibet]] amid untold hardships. [[Peter the Great]] admitted the Jesuits into Russia. [[Jansenism]], the Society's bitterest foe, received its death-blow in 1708 by a Bull of [[Clement XI]] ordering the suppression of [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royal]]. The destruction of Port Royal was coupled with the condemnation of the errors of [[Pasquier Quesnel]] by the [[papal bull]] ''Unigenitus'' (1711).

Three Jesuits, [[Tolomei]], [[Cienfuegos]], and [[Salerno]], were, in short succession, raised to the dignity of the cardinalate.

At this period the debate over the [[Chinese Rites]] was at its height. The Jesuit missionaries in [[China]] had been accused of not obeying the orders of the Pope. Tamburini, though naturally of a gentle disposition, could be firm when the honour of the Society was at stake. He protested energetically, and when in 1711 the procurators of all the provinces of the Society were assembled in Rome, he had them sign a protest which he dedicated to Pope Clement XI. In the name of all the assistants and procurators gathered at Rome, he protested the fidelity and obedience of the whole Society to the Vicar of Christ.

In France, the long reign of [[Louis XIV]], so favorable to the Jesuits in many respects, saw the beginning of those hostile movements which were to lead to the suppression of the Order. This was seen at his death, 1715, when the regent banished the once influential father confessor [[Le Tellier]], while the gallicanizing [[archbishop of Paris]], [[Cardinal de Noailles]], laid them under an interdict (1716–1729).

During his generalate the mission of [[Paraguay]] reached its highest degree of success; in one year no fewer than 77 missionaries left for it; the missionary labors of St. [[Francis de Geronimo]] and Blessed [[Anthony Baldinucci]] in Italy, and Venerable [[Manuel Padial]] in Spain, enhanced the reputation of the Society.

Tamburini died at the age of 82.

[[File:Peraldus Knight.jpg|thumb|An early example of the ''miles christianus'' allegory in a manuscript of the ''Summa Vitiorum'' by [[William Peraldus]], mid 13th century. The knight is equipped with a detailed [[Armour of God]], including an early depiction of the [[Shield of the Trinity]], and he is crowned by an angel holding the gloss ''non coronabuntur nisi qui legitime certaverint'' "none will be crowned but those who truly [[:wikt:certo#Latin|struggle]]" and in the other hand a list of the seven [[beatitudes]], matched with the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] and the [[seven heavenly virtues]] which in turn are set against the [[seven cardinal vices]].]]
[[File:Ghent Altarpiece E - Knights of Christ.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Christi milites''  to the left of the "Adoration of the Mystic Lamb" in the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] (c. 1430)]]

The '''''miles Christianus''''' ([[Christian]] soldier) or "'''''miles Christi'''''" (soldier of [[Jesus in Christianity|Christ]]) is a Christian [[allegory]] based on [[New Testament military metaphors]], especially the [[Armor of God]] metaphor of military equipment standing for Christian virtues &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ephesians|6:14-17|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on certain passages of the Old Testament from the [[Latin Vulgate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Job|7:1|4}} ([[Vulgate]]): ''Militia est vita hominis super terram''...&lt;/ref&gt;

By the fifth century, the Church had started to develop doctrines that allowed for Christian participation in battle, though this was limited by a requirement that the fighting must be undertaken to convert [[infidel]]s or spread the [[Christ in Majesty|glory of Christ]]. Christians were not to fight for conquest or personal glory.&lt;ref name=ideal&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 1449-9320| volume = 8| issue = Journal Article| pages = 77–| last = Iwanczak| first = Wojciech| title = Miles Christi: the medieval ideal of knighthood| journal = Journal of the Australian Early Medieval Association| date = 2012| url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GPS&amp;sw=w&amp;u=wikipedia&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA454359740&amp;asid=b7bcab1e0aab147ff62b696318501ae7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of ''miles Christi'' and ''militia Christi'' can be traced back to the first century AD.&lt;ref name=ideal/&gt; The phrase ''miles Christi'', derived from a letter from [[Paul the Apostle]] and much employed by [[Pope Gregory VII]], also appeared in the ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' in reference to the young [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Prince Tancred]], [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond]], [[Godfrey of Bouillon|Godfrey]] and [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Count Raymond of Toulouse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQEM2MzGP58C&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Kostick |first=Conor |year=2008 |title=The Social Structure of the First Crusade |location=Leiden, Netherlands |publisher=Koninklijnke Brill NV |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; each of whom were Christian leaders in the [[First Crusade]].

The metaphor has its origins in early Christianity of the Roman Empire, and gave rise to the contrasting term ''[[pagan]]us'' (hitherto used in the sense of "civilian", "one lacking discipline") for its opposite, i.e. one who was not a soldier of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Weekley, ''Etymological Dictionary of English'', s.v. "pagan".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chivalry]] as the idealized image of [[knighthood]] was a common [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|moral allegory]] in early Christian literature.&lt;ref name=ideal/&gt; Knighthood emerged as a concept during the time of [[Charlemagne]]. During the [[Saxon Wars]], Charlemagne's Christian knights attended mass, surrounded by relics, before battles.&lt;ref name=ideal/&gt;

Fragments from 15th c. Polish chronicler [[Jan Długosz]] describe the [[sanctification]] of weapons and a concept of knighthood that was grounded in religion.&lt;ref name=ideal/&gt; It became a theme in [[medieval art|art]] during the [[High Middle Ages]], with depictions of a [[knight]] with his various pieces of equipment identified with various [[virtue]]s. This parallels the development of the understanding in medieval [[Christendom]] of the armed nobility as defenders of the faith, first emphasized by [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] in the context of the [[Investiture controversy]] and later made even more explicit with the actual military expeditions of the [[crusades]]. 
Depictions of the ''miles christianus'' with the emblematic Armour of God however remained very rare in the medieval period and only became prominent after the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;"depictions of the miles christianus in emblematic armour are extremely rare before the Reformation" (Evans p. 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early modern period, the understanding of the term again became more metaphorical, but it survives in various Christian orders or confessions; it is especially pronounced among the [[Jesuits]] and in the [[Salvation Army]], and it is the central theme of the 18th century hymn "[[Soldiers of Christ, Arise]]" and the 19th century hymn "[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]."

''''Mushin'''' in Japanese and ''''Wuxin'''' in Chinese (無心 "no mind") is a mental state. [[Zen]] and [[Daoist meditation|Daoist meditators]] are said to reach this state, as well as artists and trained [[Martial arts|martial artists]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of the Martial Arts''. Louis Frederic (author), Paul H Crompton (editor). 2006. Dover Publications Inc.. {{ISBN|978-0486444024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, Manual Of Zen Buddhism, p. 80, http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/manual_zen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, Livia (2010), ''Sitting in Oblivion: The Heart of Daoist Meditation'', Three Pines Press. pp 73-100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steve Odin. Artistic Detachment in Japan and the West: Psychic Distance in Comparative Aesthetics. University of Hawaii Press, 2001, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; They also practice this mental state during everyday activities.

==Etymology==
The term contains the character for negation, "not" or "without" ([[無]]), along with the character for [[Xin (concept)|heart-mind]] ([[心]]). The term is shortened from  {{nihongo|'''''mushin no shin'''''|無心の心}}, a [[Zen]] expression meaning ''the mind without mind'' and is also referred to as the state of "no-mindness".  That is, a mind not fixed or occupied by thought or emotion and thus open to everything. It is translated by [[D.T. Suzuki]] as "being free from mind-attachment".&lt;ref&gt;Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, Manual Of Zen Buddhism, p. 80, http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/manual_zen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
Mushin is achieved when a person's mind is free from thoughts of anger, fear, or ego during combat or everyday life.  There is an absence of discursive thought and judgment, so the person is totally free to act and react towards an opponent without hesitation and without disturbance from such thoughts.  At this point, a person relies not on what they ''think'' should be the next move, but what is their trained natural reaction (or instinct) or what is ''felt'' intuitively. It is not a state of relaxed, near-sleepfulness, however. The mind could be said to be working at a very high speed, but with no intention, plan or direction.

Some masters believe that mushin is the state where a person finally understands the uselessness of techniques and becomes truly free to move. In fact, those people will no longer even consider themselves as "fighters" but merely living beings moving through space.

The legendary Zen master [[Takuan Sōhō]] said:&lt;ref&gt;Soho, Takuan. ''The Unfettered Mind''. Trans. William Scott Wilson. Tokyo: Kodansha International Ltd., 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The mind must always be in the state of 'flowing,' for when it stops anywhere that means the flow is interrupted and it is this interruption that is injurious to the well-being of the mind. In the case of the swordsman, it means death.&lt;br&gt; 
When the swordsman stands against his opponent, he is not to think of the opponent, nor of himself, nor of his enemy's sword movements. He just stands there with his sword which, forgetful of all technique, is ready only to follow the dictates of the subconscious. The man has effaced himself as the wielder of the sword. When he strikes, it is not the man but the sword in the hand of the man's subconscious that strikes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Applications==
However, mushin is not just a state of mind that can be achieved during combat.  Many martial artists train to achieve this state of mind during [[kata]] so that a flawless execution of moves is accomplished — that they may be achieved during combat or at any other time. Once mushin is attained through the practice or study of martial arts (although it can be accomplished through other arts or practices that refine the mind and body), the objective is to then attain this same level of complete awareness in other aspects of the practitioner's life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57878">The '''nature versus nurture''' debate involves whether human behavior is determined by the environment, either [[prenatal development|prenatal]] or during a person's life, or [[behavioral genetics|by a person's genes]]. The alliterative expression "nature and nurture" in English has been in use since at least the Elizabethan period&lt;ref&gt;In English at least since Shakespeare (''[[The Tempest]]'' 4.1: ''a born devil, on whose nature nurture can never stick'') and [[Richard Barnfield]] (''Nature and nurture once together met / The soule and shape in decent order set.''); in the 18th century used by [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke]] (''Roach v. Garvan'', "I appointed therefore the mother guardian, who is properly so by nature and nurture, where there is no testamentary guardian.")&lt;/ref&gt; and goes back to [[medieval French]].&lt;ref&gt;English usage is based on a tradition going back to medieval literature, where the opposition of ''nature'' ("instinct, inclination")  ''norreture'' ("culture, adopted mores") is a common motif, famously in [[Chretien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail|Perceval]]'', where the hero's effort to suppress his natural impulse of compassion in favor of what he considers proper courtly behavior leads to catastrophe. 
Lacy, Norris J. (1980) ''The Craft of Chrétien de Troyes: An Essay on Narrative Art'', Brill Archive, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GekUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 5].&lt;/ref&gt;
The combination of the two concepts as complementary is ancient ([[Classical Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἁπό φύσεως καὶ εὐτροφίας}}&lt;ref&gt;in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' 351b; an opposition is made by Protagoras' character between ''art'' on one hand and ''constitution and fit nurture'' (nature and nurture) of the soul on the other, ''art'' (as well as ''rage and madness'';  ἀπὸ τέχνης  ἀπὸ θυμοῦ γε καὶ ἀπὸ μανίας) contributing to ''boldness'' (θάρσος), but ''nature and nurture'' combine to contribute to ''courage'' (ἀνδρεία). "Protagoras, in spite of the misgiving of Socrates, has no scruple in announcing himself a teacher of virtue, because virtue in the sense by him understood seems sufficiently secured by nature and nurture." Mackay, R. W. (1869) "Introduction to the ''Meno'' in comparison with the ''Protagoras''" [https://books.google.com/books?id=bHHJoQoeIS0C&amp;pg=PA138 p. 138] in ''Meno: A Dialogue on the Nature and Meaning of Education''.&lt;/ref&gt;). Nature is what we think of as pre-wiring and is influenced by genetic inheritance and other biological factors. Nurture is generally taken as the influence of external factors after conception e.g. the product of exposure, experience and learning on an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://simplypsychology.org/naturevsnurture.html|title=Nature Nurture in Psychology {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=simplypsychology.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase in its modern sense was popularized by the English Victorian polymath [[Francis Galton]], the modern founder of [[eugenics]] and [[behavioral genetics]], discussing the influence of [[heredity]] and &lt;!--social--&gt;environment on social advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_uE-bpGo2N4C&amp;pg=PA227 |title=Proceedings, Volume 7 |publisher=Royal Institution of Great Britain |date=1875}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CCepY1AJYNQC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Nature+versus+nurture+galton&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=English Men of Science: Their Nature and Nurture|author= Francis Galton |publisher=  D.

The view that humans acquire all or almost all their behavioral traits from "nurture" was termed ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("blank slate") by [[John Locke]] in 1690. A "blank slate view" in human developmental psychology assuming that human behavioral traits develop almost exclusively from environmental influences, was widely held during much of the 20th century (sometimes termed "blank-slatism").
The debate between "blank-slate" denial of the influence of heritability, and the view admitting both environmental and heritable traits, has often been cast in terms of nature ''versus'' nurture. These two conflicting approaches to human development were at the core of an ideological dispute over research agendas throughout the second half of the 20th century. As both "nature" and "nurture" factors were found to contribute substantially, often in an extricable manner, such views were seen as naive or outdated by most scholars of human development by the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, David S. (2003).

The strong dichotomy of nature ''versus'' nurture has thus been claimed to have limited relevance in some fields of research. Close [[feedback]] loops have been found in which "nature" and "nurture" influence one another constantly, as seen in [[self-domestication]]. In [[ecology]] and behavioral genetics, researchers think nurture has an essential influence on nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Powledge, Tabitha M. |title=Behavioral Epigenetics: How Nurture Shapes Nature|journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=588–592 |date=August 2011 |doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.8.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Normile, Dennis |title=Nature From Nurture |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=351 |issue=6276 |pages=908–910 |date=February 2016|subscription=yes |doi=10.1126/science.351.6276.908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in other fields, the dividing line between an inherited and an acquired trait becomes unclear, as in [[epigenetics]]&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=David S.|title=The Developing Genome: An Introduction to Behavioral Epigenetics|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199922345|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Prenatal development|fetal development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25365 Edge.org: Nature Versus Nurture]. edge.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gutiérrez, Luci (January 24, 2014)  [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304302704579334954138196792 Time to Retire The Simplicity of Nature vs. Nurture], ''Wall Street Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the debate==
[[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) is often cited as the foundational document of the "blank slate" view. Locke was criticizing [[René Descartes]]'s claim of an [[innate idea]] of [[God]] universal to humanity.
Locke's view was harshly criticized in his own time. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]], complained that by denying the possibility of any innate ideas, 
Locke  "threw all order and virtue out of the world", leading to total [[moral relativism]].
Locke's was not the predominant view in the 19th century, which on the contrary tended to focus on "[[instinct]]".
Leda Cosmides and John Tooby noted that [[William James]] (1842–1910) argued that humans have ''more'' instincts than animals, and that greater freedom of action is the result of having more psychological instincts, not fewer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html Cosmides &amp; Tooby, Evolutionary Psychology: A Primer]. psych.ucsb.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of "innate ideas" or "instincts" were of some importance in the discussion of [[free will]] in [[moral philosophy]]. In 18th-century philosophy, this was cast in terms of "innate ideas" establishing the presence of a universal virtue, prerequisite for objective morals. In the 20th century, this argument was in a way inverted, as some philosophers now argued that the evolutionary origins of human behavioral traits forces us to concede that there is no foundation for ethics ([[J. L. Mackie]]), while others treat ethics as a field in complete isolation from evolutionary considerations ([[Thomas Nagel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metanexus.net/metanexus_online/show_article2.asp?ID=6008 |first=John |last=Mizonni |title=Ruse's Darwinian ethics and Moral Realism |publisher=Metanexus Institute |work=metanexus.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001133708/http://www.metanexus.net/metanexus_online/show_article2.asp?id=6008 |archivedate=2006-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, there was an increased interest in the role of the environment, as a reaction to the strong focus on pure heredity in the wake of the triumphal success of Darwin's theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Craven, Hamilton (1978) ''The Triumph of Evolution:  The Heredity-Environment Controversy, 1900–1941'': 
"While it would be inaccurate to say that most American experimentalists concluded as the result of the general acceptance of Mendelism by 1910 or so that heredity was all powerful and environment of no consequence, it was nevertheless true that heredity occupied a much more prominent place than environment in their writings."&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the [[social sciences]] developed as the project of studying the influence of culture in clean isolation from questions related to "biology".
[[Franz Boas]]'s  ''[[The Mind of Primitive Man]]'' (1911) established a program that would dominate American anthropology for the next fifteen years. In this study he established that in any given population, biology, language, material and symbolic culture, are autonomous; that each is an equally important dimension of human nature, but that no one of these dimensions is reducible to another.

The tool of [[twin study|twin studies]] was developed as a research design intended to exclude all confounders based on [[behavioural genetics|inherited behavioral traits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rende|first=R. D.|last2=Plomin|first2=R.|last3=Vandenberg|first3=S. G.|date=March 1990|title=Who discovered the twin method?|journal=Behavior Genetics|volume=20|issue=2|pages=277–285|issn=0001-8244|pmid=2191648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such studies are designed to decompose the variability of a given trait in a given population into a genetic and an environmental component.

[[John B. Watson]] in the 1920s and 1930s established the school of purist [[behaviorism]] that would become dominant over the following decades. Watson is often said to have been convinced of the complete dominance of cultural influence over anything that heredity might contribute, based on the following quote which is frequently repeated without context:
:"Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in and I'll guarantee to take any one at random and train him to become any type of specialist I might select – doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and, yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors. I am going beyond my facts and I admit it, but so have the advocates of the contrary and they have been doing it for many thousands of years"  (''Behaviorism'', 1930, p. 82).

The last sentence of the above quote is frequently omitted, leading to confusion about Watson's position. 

During the 1940s to 1960s, [[Ashley Montagu]] was a notable proponent of this purist form of behaviorism which allowed no contribution from heredity whatsoever: 

:"Man is man because he has no instincts, because everything he is and has become he has learned, acquired, from his culture ... with the exception of the instinctoid reactions in infants to sudden withdrawals of support and to sudden loud noises, the human being is entirely instinctless."&lt;ref&gt;''Man and Aggression'' (1968) cited after Pinker, Steven (2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature'', Penguin, New York, {{ISBN|1501264338}}, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Calvin Hall&lt;ref&gt;Hall, C. S. (1951) "The Genetics of Behavior", pp. 304–329 in ''Handbook of Experimental Psychology'', S. S. Stevens (Ed.), New York, NY, USA: John Wiley and Sons&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the dichotomy opposing nature to nurture is ultimately fruitless.

[[Robert Ardrey]] in the 1960s argued for innate attributes of human nature, especially concerning [[territoriality]], in the widely read ''African Genesis'' (1961) and ''[[The Territorial Imperative]]''. [[Desmond Morris]] in ''[[The Naked Ape]]''  (1967) expressed similar views.
Organised opposition to Montagu's kind of purist "blank-slatism" began to pick up in the 1970s, notably led by [[E. O. Wilson]] (''[[On Human Nature]]'' 1979).
Twin studies established that there was, in many cases, a significant heritable component. 
These results did not in any way point to overwhelming contribution of heritable factors, with heritability typically ranging around 40% to 50%, so that the controversy may not be cast in terms of purist behaviorism vs. purist nativism. Rather, it was purist behaviorism which was gradually replaced by the now-predominant view that both kinds of factors usually contribute to a given trait, anecdotally phrased by [[Donald O. Hebb|Donald Hebb]] as an answer to the question  "which, nature or nurture, contributes more to personality?" by asking in response, "Which contributes more to the area of a rectangle, its length or its width?"&lt;ref&gt;Meaney M. (2004) "The nature of nurture: maternal effects and chromatin remodelling", in ''Essays in Social Neuroscience'', Cacioppo, J. T. &amp; Berntson, G. G. (eds.) MIT press. {{ISBN|0-262-03323-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a comparable avenue of research,  anthropologist Donald Brown in the 1980s surveyed hundreds of anthropological studies from around the world and collected a set of [[cultural universals]]. He identified approximately 150 such features, coming to the conclusion there is indeed a "universal human nature", and that these features point to what that universal human nature is.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker (2002), pp. 435–439.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the controversy, during the 1970s to 1980s, the debate was highly ideologised. In ''[[Not in Our Genes: Biology, Ideology and Human Nature]]'' (1984), [[Richard Lewontin]], [[Steven Rose]] and [[Leon Kamin]] criticise "[[genetic determinism]]" from a [[Marxist]] framework, arguing that "Science is the ultimate legitimator of bourgeois ideology ... If [[biological determinism]] is a weapon in the struggle between classes, then the universities are weapons factories, and their teaching and research faculties are the engineers, designers, and production workers." The debate thus shifted away from whether heritable traits exist to whether it was politically or ethically permissible to admit their existence. The authors deny this, requesting that evolutionary inclinations be discarded in ethical and political discussions regardless of whether they exist or not.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A. (2008) ''The Brighter Side of Human Nature''. Basic Books. {{ISBN|078672465X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritability studies became much easier to perform, and hence much more numerous, with the advances of genetic studies during the 1990s. By the late 1990s, an overwhelming amount of evidence had accumulated that amounts to a refutation of the extreme forms of "blank-slatism" advocated by Watson or Montagu.

This revised state of affairs was summarized in books aimed at a popular audience from the late 1990s. In ''[[The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do]]'' (1998), [[Judith Rich Harris]] was heralded by [[Steven Pinker]] as a book that "will come to be seen as a turning point in the [[history of psychology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harris, Judith Rich |title=The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do, Revised and Updated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uKBJRMJBjcC&amp;pg=PR21|date=24 February 2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-0165-0|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but Harris was criticized for exaggerating the point of "parental upbringing seems to matter less than previously thought" to the implication that "parents do not matter".&lt;ref&gt;A position not actually taken by the author, but apparently it was feared that "lay readers" would still interpret the book in this way, as in  "Will it free some to mistreat their kids, since 'it doesn't matter'?", with this fear being attributed to "psychologist Frank Farley of Temple University, president of the APA division that honored Harris" by {{cite news |last=Begley |first=Sharon |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/newsweek/parent090798a.htm |title=The Parent Trap |newspaper=Newsweek |date=1998-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation as it presented itself by the end of the 20th century was summarized in ''[[The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature]]'' (2002) by [[Steven Pinker]]. The book became a best-seller, and was instrumental in bringing to the attention of a wider public the paradigm shift away from the behaviourist purism of the 1940s to 1970s that had taken place over the preceding decades. Pinker portrays the adherence to pure blank-slatism as an ideological [[dogma]] linked to two other dogmas found in the dominant view of human nature in the 20th century, which he termed "[[noble savage]]" (in the sense that people are born good and corrupted by bad influence) and 
"[[ghost in the machine]]"  (in the sense that there is a human soul capable of moral choices completely detached from biology). Pinker argues that all three dogmas were held onto for an extended period even in the face of evidence because they were seen as ''desirable'' in the sense that if any human trait is purely conditioned by culture, any undesired trait (such as crime or aggression) may be engineered away by purely cultural (political means). Pinker focuses on reasons he assumes were responsible for unduly repressing evidence to the contrary, notably the fear of (imagined or projected) political or ideological consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pinker, Steven |url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/index.html |title=Steven Pinker – Books – The Blank Slate |publisher=Pinker.wjh.harvard.edu |accessdate=2011-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510091413/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/index.html |archivedate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritability estimates==
{{main|Heritability}}
[[File:Sibling-correlation-422.png|422px|thumb|right|This chart illustrates three patterns one might see when studying the influence of genes and environment on traits in individuals. Trait A shows a high sibling correlation, but little heritability (i.e. high shared environmental variance ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; low heritability ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Trait B shows a high heritability since correlation of trait rises sharply with the degree of genetic similarity. Trait C shows low heritability, but also low correlations generally; this means Trait C has a high nonshared environmental variance ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, the degree to which individuals display Trait C has little to do with either genes or broadly predictable environmental factors—roughly, the outcome approaches random for an individual. Notice also that even identical twins raised in a common family rarely show 100% trait correlation.]]

It is important to note that the term ''heritability'' refers only to the degree of genetic variation between people on a trait.  It does not refer to the degree to which a trait of a particular individual is due to environmental or genetic factors. The traits of an individual are always a complex interweaving of both.&lt;ref name=PinkerBlankSlate&gt;Pinker, Steven (September 30, 2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''.  Viking; 1st edition. {{ISBN|978-0670031511}}. [http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ff0616s.pdf Lay summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226054452/http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ff0616S.pdf |date=2014-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For an individual, even strongly genetically influenced, or "obligate" traits, such as eye color, assume the inputs of a typical environment during ontogenetic development (e.g., certain ranges of temperatures, oxygen levels, etc.).

In contrast, the "heritability index" statistically quantifies the extent to which variation ''between individuals'' on a trait is due to variation in the genes those individuals carry. In animals where breeding and environments can be controlled experimentally, heritability can be determined relatively easily. Such experiments would be unethical for human research. This problem can be overcome by finding existing populations of humans that reflect the experimental setting the researcher wishes to create.

One way to determine the contribution of genes and environment to a trait is to [[twin study|study twins]]. In one kind of study, [[identical twins]] reared apart are compared to randomly selected pairs of people. The twins share identical genes, but different family environments. In another kind of twin study, identical twins reared together (who share family environment and genes) are compared to [[fraternal twins]] reared together (who also share family environment but only share half their genes). Another condition that permits the disassociation of genes and environment is [[adoption]]. In one kind of [[adoption study]], biological siblings reared together (who share the same family environment and half their genes) are compared to adoptive siblings (who share their family environment but none of their genes).

In many cases, it has been found that genes make a substantial contribution, including psychological traits such as intelligence and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Neill, J. T. |year=2004 |url=http://www.wilderdom.com/personality/L4-1IntelligenceNatureVsNurture.html |title=Nature vs Nurture in Intelligence |website=wilderdom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet heritability may differ in other circumstances, for instance environmental deprivation. Examples of low, medium, and high heritability traits include:

&lt;center&gt;
{|class="wikitable" style="width:60%;"
|-
!Low heritability!!Medium heritability!!High heritability
|-
|align=center|Specific language||align=center|Weight||align=center|Blood type
|-
|align=center|Specific religion||align=center|Religiosity||align=center|Eye color
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Twin and adoption studies have their methodological limits.  For example, both are limited to the range of environments and genes which they sample.  Almost all of these studies are conducted in Western, first-world countries, and therefore cannot be extrapolated globally to include poorer, non-western populations.  Additionally, both types of studies depend on particular assumptions, such as the [[equal environments assumption]] in the case of twin studies, and the lack of pre-adoptive effects in the case of adoption studies.

Since the definition of "nature" in this context is tied to "heritability", the definition of "nurture" has necessarily become very wide, including any type of causality that is not heritable. The term has thus moved away from its original connotation of "cultural influences" to include all effects of the environment, including; indeed, a substantial source of environmental input to [[human nature]] may arise from stochastic variations in prenatal development and is thus in no sense of the term "cultural".&lt;ref name="pmid9331275"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rice D.

==Interaction of genes and environment==

{{rquote|right|Many properties of the brain are genetically organized, and don't depend on information coming in from the senses.|[[Steven Pinker]]}}
Heritability refers to the origins of differences between people. Individual development, even of highly heritable traits, such as eye color, depends on a range of environmental factors, from the other genes in the organism, to physical variables such as temperature, oxygen levels etc. during its development or ontogenesis.

The variability of trait can be meaningfully spoken of as being due in certain proportions to genetic differences ("nature"), or environments ("nurture"). For highly [[wikt:penetrant|penetrant]] [[Mendelian]] genetic disorders such as [[Huntington's disease]] virtually all the incidence of the disease is due to genetic differences. Huntington's animal models live much longer or shorter lives depending on how they are cared for {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

At the other extreme, traits such as [[native language]] are environmentally determined: linguists have found that any child (if capable of learning a language at all) can learn any human language with equal facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jespersen|first=Otto|title=Language, its nature, development, and origin|year=1922|publisher=H. Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt; With virtually all biological and psychological traits, however, genes and environment work in concert, communicating back and forth to create the individual.

At a molecular level, genes interact with signals from other genes and from the environment. While there are many thousands of single-gene-locus traits, so-called [[complex traits]] are due to the additive effects of many (often hundreds) of small gene effects. A good example of this is height, where variance appears to be spread across many hundreds of loci.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ng.608 |pmid=20562875 |title=Common SNPs explain a large proportion of the heritability for human height |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=565–9 |year=2010 |last1=Yang |first1=Jian |last2=Benyamin |first2=Beben |last3=McEvoy |first3=Brian P |last4=Gordon |first4=Scott |last5=Henders |first5=Anjali K |last6=Nyholt |first6=Dale R |last7=Madden |first7=Pamela A |last8=Heath |first8=Andrew C |last9=Martin |first9=Nicholas G |last10=Montgomery |first10=Grant W |last11=Goddard |first11=Michael E |last12=Visscher |first12=Peter M |pmc=3232052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme genetic or environmental conditions can predominate in rare circumstances—if a child is born mute due to a genetic mutation, it will not learn to speak any language regardless of the environment; similarly, someone who is practically certain to eventually develop Huntington's disease according to their genotype may die in an unrelated accident (an environmental event) long before the disease will manifest itself.

Harvard Online PDF Pinker, Steven. 2004. Why nature &amp; nurture won't go away.

:concrete behavioral traits that patently depend on content provided by the home or culture—which language one speaks, which religion one practices, which political party one supports—are not heritable at all. But traits that reflect the underlying talents and temperaments—how proficient with language a person is, how religious, how liberal or conservative—are partially heritable.

When traits are determined by a complex interaction of [[genotype]] and environment it is possible to measure the [[heritability]] of a trait within a population. However, many non-scientists who encounter a report of a trait having a certain percentage heritability imagine non-interactional, additive contributions of genes and environment to the trait. As an analogy, some laypeople may think of the degree of a trait being made up of two "buckets," genes and environment, each able to hold a certain capacity of the trait. But even for intermediate heritabilities, a trait is always shaped by both genetic dispositions and the environments in which people develop, merely with greater and lesser plasticities associated with these heritability measures.

Heritability measures always refer to the degree of ''variation between individuals in a population''. That is, as these statistics cannot be applied at the level of the individual, it would be incorrect to say that while the heritability index of personality is about 0.6, 60% of one's personality is obtained from one's parents and 40% from the environment. To help to understand this, imagine that all humans were genetic clones. The heritability index for all traits would be zero (all variability between clonal individuals must be due to environmental factors). And, contrary to erroneous interpretations of the heritability index, as societies become more egalitarian (everyone has more similar experiences) the heritability index goes up (as environments become more similar, variability between individuals is due more to genetic factors).

One should also take into account the fact that the variables of heritability and environmentality are not precise and vary within a chosen population and across cultures. It would be more accurate to state that the degree of heritability and environmentality is measured in its reference to a particular phenotype in a chosen group of a population in a given period of time. The accuracy of the calculations is further hindered by the number of coefficients taken into consideration, age being one such variable. The display of the influence of heritability and environmentality differs drastically across age groups: the older the studied age is, the more noticeable the heritability factor becomes, the younger the test subjects are, the more likely it is to show signs of strong influence of the environmental factors.

Some have pointed out that environmental inputs affect the expression of genes&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; (see the article on [[epigenetics]]). This is one explanation of how environment can influence the extent to which a genetic disposition will actually manifest.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The interactions of genes with environment, called [[gene–environment interaction]]s, are another component of the nature–nurture debate. A classic example of gene–environment interaction is the ability of a diet low in the amino acid [[phenylalanine]] to partially suppress the genetic disease [[phenylketonuria]]. Yet another complication to the nature–nurture debate is the existence of [[gene–environment correlation]]s. These correlations indicate that individuals with certain genotypes are more likely to find themselves in certain environments. Thus, it appears that genes can shape (the selection or creation of) environments. Even using experiments like those described above, it can be very difficult to determine convincingly the relative contribution of genes and environment.

A study conducted by T. J. Bouchard, Jr. showed data that has been evidence for the importance of genes when testing middle-aged twins reared together and reared apart. The results shown have been important evidence against the importance of environment when determining, happiness, for example. In the Minnesota study of twins reared apart, it was actually found that there was higher correlation for monozygotic twins reared apart (0.52)than monozygotic twins reared together (0.44). Also, highlighting the importance of genes, these correlations found much higher correlation among monozygotic than dizygotic twins that had a correlation of 0.08 when reared together and −0.02 when reared apart.&lt;ref name=lykken1996&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00355.x |url=http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/courses/psyc5112/Readings/psnHappiness_Lykken.pdf|title=Happiness is a Stochastic Phenomenon|journal=Psychological Science|volume=7|issue=3|pages=186–189|year=1996|last1=Lykken|first1=David|last2=Tellegen|first2=Auke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social pre-wiring===
{{One source section|date=December 2017}}
'''The social pre-wiring hypothesis''' refers to the [[ontogeny]] of [[social relation|social interaction]]. Also informally referred to as, "wired to be social." The theory questions whether there is a propensity to [[social actions|socially oriented action]] already present ''before'' birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique [[genetics|genetic]] wiring to be social.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951360/ Umberto Castiello, et al: National Institutes of Health&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for [[social relation|social interaction]]. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of [[socialization]] or [[social construction]]. Rather, newborns most likely [[heredity|inherit]] to some extent [[social behavior]] and [[identity (social science)|identity]] through [[genetics]].&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

Principal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are [[social behavior]]s that are [[heredity|inherited]] and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form of [[social relation|social interaction]] before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

The social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct, "The central advance of this study is the demonstration that '[[social actions]]' are already performed in the second trimester of [[gestational age|gestation]]. Starting from the 14th week of [[gestational age|gestation]] twin foetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of [[social behavior]]: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin foetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions.".&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

===Obligate vs. facultative adaptations===
Traits may be considered to be adaptations (such as the umbilical cord), byproducts of adaptations (the belly button) or due to random variation (convex or concave belly button shape).&lt;ref name=Buss2011/&gt;
An alternative to contrasting nature and nurture focuses on  "obligate vs. facultative" adaptations.&lt;ref name=Buss2011&gt;Buss, D. M. (2011). Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind (4 ed.). New York: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptations may be generally more obligate (robust in the face of typical environmental variation) or more facultative (sensitive to typical environmental variation).  For example, the rewarding sweet taste of sugar and the pain of bodily injury are obligate psychological adaptations—typical environmental variability during development does not much affect their operation.&lt;ref&gt;Symons, D. (1979). The evolution of human sexuality. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, facultative adaptations are somewhat like "if-then" statements.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, K. (2013).  [http://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-12-heritability.html Explainer: What is Heritability?].  MedicalXpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a facultative psychological adaptation may be adult [[attachment style]]. The attachment style of adults, (for example, a "secure attachment style," the propensity to develop close, trusting bonds with others) is proposed to be conditional on whether an individual's early childhood caregivers could be trusted to provide reliable assistance and attention. An example of a facultative physiological adaptation is tanning of skin on exposure to sunlight (to prevent skin damage). Facultative social adaptation have also been proposed. For example, whether a society is warlike or peaceful has been proposed to be conditional on how much collective threat that society is experiencing &lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers |isbn=978-1-78374-403-9 |doi=10.11647/OBP.0128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Advanced techniques===

Quantitative studies of heritable traits throw light on the question.

Developmental genetic analysis examines the effects of genes over the course of a human lifespan. Early studies of intelligence, which mostly examined young children, found that [[heritability]] measured 40–50%. Subsequent developmental genetic analyses found that variance attributable to additive environmental effects is less apparent in older individuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Plomin |first=R. |last2=Spinath |first2=F. M. |year=2004 |title=Intelligence: genetics, genes, and genomics |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=112–129 |pmid=14717631 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.1.112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGue, M.; Bouchard Jr., T.

Multivariate genetic analysis examines the genetic contribution to several traits that vary together. For example, multivariate genetic analysis has demonstrated that the genetic determinants of all specific cognitive abilities (e.g., memory, spatial reasoning, processing speed) overlap greatly, such that the genes associated with any specific cognitive ability will affect all others. Similarly, multivariate genetic analysis has found that genes that affect scholastic achievement completely overlap with the genes that affect cognitive ability.

Extremes analysis examines the link between normal and pathological traits. For example, it is hypothesized that a given behavioral disorder may represent an extreme of a continuous distribution of a normal behavior and hence an extreme of a continuous distribution of genetic and environmental variation. Depression, phobias, and reading disabilities have been examined in this context.

For a few highly heritable traits, studies have identified loci associated with variance in that trait, for instance in some individuals with [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harrison | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Owen | first2 = M. J. | year = 2003 | title = Genes for schizophrenia?

===Entrepreneurship===
Through studies of identical twins separated at birth, one-third of their creative thinking abilities come from genetics and two-thirds come from learning.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, Jeffrey H., Hal B. Gregersen, and Clayton M. Christensen. (2009). Harvard Business Review.&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that between 37 and 42 percent of the explained variance can be attributed to genetic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2009.07.002|title=The genetic basis of entrepreneurship: Effects of gender and personality|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=110|issue=2|pages=93–107|year=2009|last1=Zhang|first1=Zhen|last2=Zyphur|first2=Michael J.|last3=Narayanan|first3=Jayanth|last4=Arvey|first4=Richard D.|last5=Chaturvedi|first5=Sankalp|last6=Avolio|first6=Bruce J.|last7=Lichtenstein|first7=Paul|last8=Larsson|first8=Gerry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learning primarily comes in the form of human capital transfers of entrepreneurial skills through parental role modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Lindquist, Matthew J., Sol, Joeri and Van Praag, Mirjam. (2012). [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2119047 Why Do Entrepreneurial Parents Have Entrepreneurial Children?] Institute for the Study of Labor.&lt;/ref&gt; Other findings agree that the key to innovative entrepreneurial success comes from environmental factors and working “10,000 hours” to gain mastery in entrepreneurial skills.&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm. (2008) ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers: The Story of Success]]''. Little, Brown and Company. {{ISBN|978-0316017923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritability of intelligence==
{{Main|Heritability of IQ}}
Evidence from [[behavioral genetics|behavioral genetic]] research suggests that family environmental factors may have an effect upon childhood [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]], accounting for up to a quarter of the variance. The American Psychological Association's report "[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]" (1995) states that there is no doubt that normal child development requires a certain minimum level of responsible care. Here, environment is playing a role in what is believed to be fully genetic (intelligence) but it was found that severely deprived, neglectful, or abusive environments have highly negative effects on many aspects of children's intellect development. Beyond that minimum, however, the role of family experience is in serious dispute. On the other hand, by late adolescence this correlation disappears, such that adoptive siblings no longer have similar IQ scores.&lt;ref name=Plomin2008&gt;Plomin, R., DeFries, J. C., McClearn, G. E., &amp; McGuffn, P. (2008). ''Behavioral Genetics'' (5th edition). New York: Worth Publishers. {{ISBN|978-1429205771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, adoption studies indicate that, by adulthood, adoptive siblings are no more similar in IQ than strangers (IQ correlation near zero), while full siblings show an IQ correlation of 0.6. Twin studies reinforce this pattern: monozygotic (identical) twins raised separately are highly similar in IQ (0.74), more so than dizygotic (fraternal) twins raised together (0.6) and much more than adoptive siblings (~0.0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=41465638|pmid=9549239|year=1998|author1=Bouchard Jr|first1=T. J.|title=Genetic and environmental influences on adult intelligence and special mental abilities|journal=Human Biology|volume=70|issue=2|pages=257–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent adoption studies also found that supportive parents can have a positive effect on the development of their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.89.2.381|title=Same-age unrelated siblings: A unique test of within-family environmental influences on IQ similarity|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=89|issue=2|pages=381–390|year=1997|last1=Segal|first1=Nancy L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality traits==
{{Main|Personality psychology#Genetic basis of personality}}
[[Personality]] is a frequently cited example of a heritable trait that has been studied in twins and adoptees using [[behavioral genetics|behavioral genetic]] study designs. The most famous categorical organization of heritable personality traits were created by Goldberg (1990) in which he had college students rate their personalities on 1400 dimensions to begin, and then narrowed these down into "[[Big Five personality traits|''The Big Five'']]" factors of personality—Openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The close genetic relationship between positive personality traits and, for example, our happiness traits are the mirror images of comorbidity in psychopathology. These personality factors were consistent across cultures, and many studies have also tested the heritability of these traits.

Identical twins reared apart are far more similar in personality than randomly selected pairs of people. Likewise, identical twins are more similar than fraternal twins. Also, biological siblings are more similar in personality than adoptive siblings. Each observation suggests that personality is heritable to a certain extent. A supporting article had focused on the heritability of personality (which is estimated to be around 50% for subjective well-being) in which a study was conducted using a representative sample of 973 twin pairs to test the heritable differences in subjective well-being which were found to be fully accounted for by the genetic model of the Five-Factor Model’s personality domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Weiss A., Bates T. C., Luciano M. |title=Happiness is a personal(ity) thing: the genetics of personality and well-being in a representative sample |journal=[[Psychological Science]] |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=205–10 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18315789 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02068.x |url=http://pss.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18315789 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these same study designs allow for the examination of environment as well as genes.

Adoption studies also directly measure the strength of shared family effects. Adopted siblings share only family environment.  Most adoption studies indicate that by adulthood the personalities of adopted siblings are little or no more similar than random pairs of strangers.  This would mean that shared family effects on personality are zero by adulthood.

In the case of personality traits, non-shared environmental effects are often found to out-weigh shared environmental effects. That is, environmental effects that are typically thought to be life-shaping (such as family life) may have less of an impact than non-shared effects, which are harder to identify. One possible source of non-shared effects is the environment of pre-natal development. Random variations in the genetic program of development may be a substantial source of non-shared environment. These results suggest that "nurture" may not be the predominant factor in "environment". Environment and our situations, do in fact impact our lives, but not the way in which we would typically react to these environmental factors. We are preset with personality traits that are the basis for how we would react to situations. An example would be how extraverted prisoners become less happy than introverted prisoners and would react to their incarceration more negatively due to their preset extraverted personality.&lt;ref name=PinkerBlankSlate/&gt;{{rp|Ch 19}} Behavioral genes are somewhat proven to exist when we take a look at fraternal twins. When fraternal twins are reared apart, they show the same similarities in behavior and response as if they have been reared together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://explorable.com/nature-vs-nurture-debate|title=Nature and Nurture Debate - Genes or Environment?|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics ==

===Genomics===
{{main|Genomics}}
The relationship between personality and people's own well-being is influenced and mediated by genes (Weiss, Bates, &amp; Luciano, 2008). There has been found to be a stable set point for happiness that is characteristic of the individual (largely determined by the individual's genes). Happiness fluctuates around that setpoint (again, genetically determined) based on whether good things or bad things are happening to us ("nurture"), but only fluctuates in small magnitude in a normal human. The midpoint of these fluctuations is determined by the "great genetic lottery" that people are born with, which leads them to conclude that how happy they may feel at the moment or over time is simply due to the luck of the draw, or gene. This fluctuation was also not due to educational attainment, which only accounted for less than 2% of the variance in well-being for women, and less than 1% of the variance for men.&lt;ref name=lykken1996/&gt;

They consider that the individualities measured together with personality tests remain steady throughout an individual’s lifespan. They further believe that human beings may refine their forms or personality but can never change them entirely. Darwin's Theory of Evolution steered naturalists such as George Williams and William Hamilton to the concept of personality evolution. They suggested that physical organs and also personality is a product of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herschkowitz, Herschkowitz, &amp; Kagan|first1=Norbert, M. &amp; Kagan|title=A Good Start In Life|date=2002|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[genomic sequencing]], it has become possible to search for and identify specific gene polymorphisms that affect traits such as IQ and personality. These techniques work by tracking the association of differences in a trait of interest with differences in specific molecular markers or functional variants. An example of a visible human trait for which the precise genetic basis of differences are relatively well known is [[eye color]]. For traits with many genes affecting the outcome, a smaller portion of the variance is currently understood: For instance for height known gene variants account for around 5–10% of height variance at present.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
When discussing the significant role of genetic heritability in relation to one's level of happiness, it has been found that from 44% to 52% of the variance in one's well-being is associated with genetic variation. Based on the retest of smaller samples of twins studies after 4,5, and 10 years, it is estimated that the heritability of the genetic stable component of subjective well-being approaches 80%.&lt;ref name=lykken1996/&gt; Other studies that have found that genes are a large influence in the variance found in happiness measures, exactly around 35–50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0033291705005374|pmid=16219116|title=Heritability of life satisfaction in adults: A twin-family study|journal=Psychological Medicine|volume=35|issue=11|pages=1581|year=2005|last1=Stubbe|first1=J.

In contrast to views developed in 1960s that gender identity is primarily learned (which led to policy-based surgical sex changed in children such as [[David Reimer]]), genomics has provided solid evidence that both sex and gender identities are primarily influenced by genes:

{{Quote|text=It is now clear that genes are vastly more influential than virtually any other force in shaping sex identity and gender identity…[T]he growing consensus in medicine is that…children should be assigned to their chromosomal (i.e., genetic) sex regardless of anatomical variations and differences—with the option of switching, if desired, later in life.|sign=[[Siddhartha Mukherjee]]|source=The Gene: An Intimate History}}

=== Linkage and association studies ===
In their attempts to locate the genes responsible for configuring certain phenotypes, researches resort to two different techniques.
Linkage study facilitates the process of determining a specific location in which a gene of interest is located. This methodology is applied only among individuals that are related and does not serve to pinpoint specific genes. It does, however, narrow down the area of search, making it easier to locate one or several genes in the genome which constitute a specific trait.

Association studies, on the other hand, are more hypothetic and seek to verify whether a particular genetic variable really influences the phenotype of interest. In association studies it is more common to use case-control approach, comparing the subject with relatively higher or lower hereditary determinants with the control subject.

Prof. Dr (hc). Mr. Drs. Raden Mas Tumenggung '''Sukamto Notonagoro''' (10 December 1905 – 23 September 1981) was an Indonesian legal scholar and thinker. He is credited as being the first to approach the state philosophy of [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] philosophically.{{sfn|Bahari|2011|p=25}}

==Biography==
Notonagoro was born Sukamto in [[Sragen Regency|Sragen]], [[Central Java]], Indonesia on 10 December 1905. After marrying Gusti Raden Ayu Koostimah, daughter of [[Pakubuwono X]], [[Susuhunan]] of [[Surakarta]], as civil servant ('"abdi dalem"') of the '"Kasunanan"' kingdom, he was promoted to the rank of '"Bupati Anom"', given the royal title '"Raden Mas Tumenggung"' and given an 'adult' name of '"Notonagoro"'.{{sfn|Bahari|2011|p=25}}

Notonagoro graduated from the ''Rechtshogeschool'' in [[Jakarta]] in 1929, receiving the title ''Meester in de Rechten''.{{sfn|Bahari|2011|p=25}} He later received a ''Doctorandus in de indologie'' from [[Leiden University]], [[Netherlands]], in 1932.{{sfn|Bahari|2011|p=25}}{{sfn|Kompas 2006, 100 Tahun Notonagoro}} After graduating, he found work in the Central Economics Office in Surakarta from 1932 to 1938. At roughly the same time, from 1933 to 1939, he taught at the Particuliere Algemene Middelbare School in Jakarta.{{sfn|Bahari|2011|p=25}}

A year after [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesia's independence]], Notonagoro was asked to join the Ministry of Prosperity; the following year, he began teaching at the Faculty of Agriculture in [[Klaten]], [[Central Java]].{{sfn|Bahari|2011|p=25}} In 1949 he assisted in the founding of [[Gadjah Mada University]] in [[Yogyakarta]],{{sfn|Kompas 2006, 100 Tahun Notonagoro}} later becoming a guest lecturer teaching agrarian law. By 1952 he had become dean of the faculty of law.{{sfn|Bahari|2011|p=25}}

Notonagoro became the founder of Gadjah Mada University's faculty of philosophy in 1968.{{sfn|Kompas 2006, 100 Tahun Notonagoro}} For his work with the university and thoughts on Pancasila, Notonagoro was given an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate in philosophy]] from Gadjah Mada University on 19 December 1973. He died on 23 September 1981.{{sfn|Bahari|2011|p=25}}

==Views==

===On Pancasila===
Notonagoro viewed the Indonesian people and culture as the [[material cause|''causa materialis'']] of Pancasila.{{sfn|Notonagoro|1987|p=28}} He believed that Pancasila, no matter how phrased, kept the same basic meaning, namely as the state philosophy,{{sfn|Notonagoro|1988|p=8}} and that it is not a political concept but a world view.{{sfn|Notonagoro|1988|p=3}} As he considered Pancasila a central tenet of the Indonesian political system, Notonagoro considered it unchangeable, with the same meaning and same aspirations conveyed to each generation of Indonesians.{{sfn|Notonagoro|1987|pp=31–32}}

He saw three fundamental aspects of Pancasila: political, socio-cultural, and religious.{{sfn|Notonagoro|1988|p=6}} In Notonagoro's system, the three aspects, as well as the five individual tenets of Pancasila, are a compound unit ({{lang-id|majemuk-tunggal}}).{{sfn|Notonagoro|1987|p=10}} Notonagoro also saw Pancasila as existing in a pyramidal hierarchy, with each tenet being a refinement of the one before it; this hierarchy ensured that Pancasila should be taken as a whole, as Notonagoro viewed the abandonment of one or more tenets as destabilizing the whole system.{{sfn|Notonagoro|1988|p=60}} For example, the first tenet (Belief in the one and only God), is implicitly the belief in the one and only God, complete with just and civilized humanity, the unity of Indonesia as well as democracy guided by the inner wisdom in the unanimity arising out of deliberations amongst representatives and full of social justice for all of the people of Indonesia.{{Cref2|A}}{{sfn|Notonagoro|1987|p=10}} According to Notonagoro, the first two tenets, belief in the one and only God and just and civilized humanity, covered all aspects of humanity and served as the basis for the other three tenets.{{sfn|Notonagoro|1988|pp=61–62}}

===On government===
Notonagoro viewed the Indonesian government as a "monodualist" state, keeping both the cultural norms as well as national safety, peace, and order.{{sfn|Notonagoro|1987|p=17}} He saw the priorities of government as follows, in descending order:{{sfn|Notonagoro|1987|p=17}}
#The public good, defined as the good of the State
#The public good, defined as the good of the collective population
#The needs of groups of individual citizens, including ones unable to be met by the citizens themselves
#The needs of individual citizens, including ones unable to be met by the citizens themselves; this includes the poor, and abandoned children

According to Notonagoro, the government derives its powers from its citizens.{{sfn|Notonagoro|1987|p=153}} He identified his views on the subject as being related to [[social democracy]].{{sfn|Notonagoro|1987|p=153}}

==Legacy==
According to Mustofa Anshori, assistant rector at Gadjah Mada University in 2006, Notonagoro helped establish the philosophical conceptualizations in the contextualization of Pancasila.{{sfn|Kompas 2006, 100 Tahun Notonagoro}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15784">'''Organizational ethics''' is the [[ethics]] of an [[organization]], and it is how an organization responds to an internal or external stimulus. Organizational ethics is interdependent with the [[organizational culture]]. Although it is akin to both '''[[organizational behavior]]''' (OB) and [[industrial and organizational psychology]] as well as '''[[business ethics]]''' on the micro and macro levels, organizational ethics is neither OB or I/O psychology, nor is it solely business ethics (which includes corporate governance and [[corporate ethics]]). Organizational ethics express the values of an organization to its employees and/or other entities irrespective of governmental and/or regulatory laws.

Ethics are the principles and values used by an individual to govern his or her actions and decisions.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurship.org"&gt;Matthews, J. (n.d.). Eight Elements of an Ethical Organization. Retrieved November 30, 2014, from http://www.entrepreneurship.org/resource-center/eight-elements-of-an-ethical-organization.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; An organization forms when individuals with varied interests and different backgrounds unite on a common platform and work together towards predefined goals and objectives.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurship.org"/&gt; A code of ethics within an organization is a set of principles that is used to guide the organization in its decisions, programs, and policies.&lt;ref name="smallbusiness.chron.com"&gt;Kelchner, L. (n.d.). The Importance of Ethics in Organizations. Retrieved November 30, 2014, from http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-ethics-organizations-20925.html&lt;/ref&gt; An ethical organizational culture consists of leaders and employees adhering to a code of ethics.&lt;ref name="smallbusiness.chron.com"/&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Business ethics.jpg|thumb]]
An organization's ethical philosophy can affect the organization in many ways including its reputation, productivity, and the bottom line of the organization.&lt;ref name="smallbusiness.chron.com"/&gt; Ethics within an organization can offer many benefits. A positive ethical corporate culture improves the morale among the workers in an organization, which could increase productivity and employee retention.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} More productivity improves the efficiency of the organizations and increased employee retention reduces the cost of replacing employees.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) restricts the United States business firms from engaging in bribery and other illegal practices internationally. There are laws that have the same type of prohibition for European companies which create a disadvantage competitively for both European and U.S. firms.&lt;ref name="qje"&gt;Svensson, Jakob, “Who Must Pay Bribes and How Much? Evidence from a Cross-Section of Firms,” ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 118(2003), page 207&lt;/ref&gt; Such laws are not a restricting element to organizations that have highly elevated ethical behavior as part of their values. Organizations that lack ethical practices as a mandatory basis of their business structure and corporate culture, have commonly been found to fail due to the absence of business ethics. Corporate downfalls would include, but are not limited to, the recent [[Enron]] and [[WorldCom]] scandals, two primary examples of unethical business practices concerning questionable accounting transactions. 

Organizations focusing on encouraging ethical practices are commonly viewed with respect by their employees, the community, and corresponding industries.&lt;ref name="man"&gt;Managing with Soul: Combining Corporate Integrity with the Bottom Line,” November 14, 2003, www.hreonline.com/HRE.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical business practices of organizations have resulted in a solid financial bottom-line. This has been seen through greater sales and increased revenue by companies retaining talented personnel and attracting new skilled employees. More importantly, an ethical organization will have the ability to retain employees that are experienced and knowledgeable (generally referred to as [[human capital]]).  This human capital results in less employee turnover, less training time for new employees, and greater output regarding [[Service (economics)|services]] (or production of [[good (economics)|goods]]).

==Basic ethical elements==

There are at least four elements that aim to create an ethical culture and behavior of employees within an organization. These elements are: 
# a written code of ethics and standards ([[ethical code]])
# ethics [[training]] for executives, managers, and employees
# the availability of ethical situational advice (i.e. advice lines or offices)
# confidential reporting systems&lt;ref name="hrm"&gt;Clark, Margaret M., JD., SPHR, "Corporate Ethics Programs Make a Difference, but not the only difference", ''HR Magazine'', July 1, 2003, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations are constantly striving for a better ethical atmosphere within the business climate and culture. Businesses must create an ethical business climate in order to develop an ethical organization. Otherwise said, companies must focus on the ethics of employees in order to create an ethical business. Employees must know the difference between what is acceptable and unacceptable in the workplace. These standards are found in the written code of ethics or may be referred to as the [[employee handbook]]. These standards are a written form of employee conduct and performance expectations.

Employee handbooks also commonly include rules concerning expectations and consequences that follow misconduct. Handbooks normally will clearly state the rules, guidelines, and standards of an organization as well as possible rules, regulations, and laws that they are bound by. Many company handbooks will include laws regarding [[sexual harassment]], [[alcohol abuse]], and [[substance abuse|drug/substance abuse]].
&lt;br&gt;For more information regarding situational ethical principles, refer to "[[Situational ethics#Situational ethics outlined|Situational Ethics]]."

==Intrinsic and extrinsic organizational rewards==
The [[intrinsic]] and [[extrinsic]] rewards of an ethical organization are bound to an organization's culture and ethics. Based on the reliability and support structure of each of the four areas needed for ethical behavior, the organizational ethics will be evident throughout the organization. The organization including the employees, managers, suppliers, customers, and other entities, will receive '''intrinsic and extrinsic rewards'''. Actions of employees can range from [[whistleblower|whistle blowing]] (intrinsic) to the extraordinary actions of hourly employee purchasing all the recently produced peanut butter (as produced by his [[employer]]), that has no resale value due to mislabeled jars. This employee was aware that his employer (extrinsic) would reimburse him in full for purchasing the mislabeled peanut butter.&lt;ref name="pfe"&gt;Peters, T.J., and Austin, N. ,(1985), Passion for Excellence: The Leadership difference. New York: Ballantine.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;For more information regarding intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, see "[[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation]]."

==Ethical theory and leadership empowerment==
There are many theories and [[organizational studies]] that are related to “organizational ethics,” but "[[organization]]s" and "ethics" are wide and varied in application and scope. These theories and studies can range from [[individual]](s), [[team]](s), [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]], [[management]], [[leadership]], [[human resources]], [[Group (sociology)|group]](s) interaction(s), as well as the [[psychological]] framework behind each area to include the distribution of [[job (role)|job]] tasks within various types of organizations. As among these areas, the influence of '''leadership''' in any organization cannot go unexamined, because of a clear understanding of the [[Wikibooks:Development Cooperation Handbook/The development aid organization/The Organization’s Vision|organization’s vision]], goals (to include immediate and long-term strategic plans), and values. Leadership sets the tone for organizational management (strategic actions taken by an organization to create a positive image to both internal and external public). In turn, leadership directly influences the organizational symbolism (which reflects the culture, the language of the members, any meaningful objects, representations, and/or how someone may act or think within an organization). The values and ideals within an organization generally center upon “values for business” as the theoretical approach most leaders use to present to their "co-members" (which in truth maybe subordinates).
&lt;br&gt;In fact, an examination of business reveals that most leaders approach the X(?) from the perspective of values for the business.&lt;ref name="DH1"&gt;Dricscoll, Dawn-Marie and Hoffman, W. Michael (2002). Ethics Matters: How to Implement Values-Driven Management&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McD"&gt;McDaniel, Charlotte, (2004), Organizational Ethics: Research and Ethical Environments, page 39&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside presenting the vision, values, and goals of the organization, the leader should infuse [[empowerment]] and [[motivation]] to its members. Leaders using '''empowerment''' to motivate their subordinates, is based upon the view of: “Achieving organizational ownership of company values is a continuous process of communication, discussion, and debate throughout all areas of the organization”&lt;ref name="DH2"&gt;Dricscoll, Dawn-Marie and Hoffman, W. Michael, (2002), Ethics Matters: How to Implement Values-Driven Management, page 172&lt;/ref&gt; as.
&lt;br&gt;For more information about organization theory, refer to "[[Organizational theory|Organizational Theory]]."

==Stakeholder theory==
Whether it is a team, small group, or a large international entity, the ability for any organization to reason, act rationally, and respond ethically is paramount. Leaders must have the ability to recognize the needs and desires of members (or called “'''stakeholders'''” in some theories or models), and how they correspond to the organization. It is the [[stakeholder theory]] that implies that all '''stakeholders''' (or individuals) must be treated equally, regardless of the fact that some individuals will contribute more than others to the organization.&lt;ref name="DAG"&gt;D.A. Gioia, (1999), "Practicability, Paradigms, and Problems in Stakeholder Theorizing," Academy of Management Review, 24(2), pp. 228–232.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Leaders who motivate others must present the goals of an organization to the stakeholders with respect to particular benefits of the stakeholders. Leaders must set aside individual (or personal) ambitions (along with any prejudice) in order to present these goals properly. Furthermore, it is leadership that influences '''stakeholders''' towards ethical behavior for the organization. They must step behind a [[veil of ignorance]] and treat every stakeholder as a means with equal weight. Importantly, the leader (or [[stakeholder management]]) must possess the necessary skills and rank to ensure that each stakeholders voice is respected and heard within the organization to ensure that other voices are not expressing views (or needs as in respects to [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]]). Therefore, stakeholder management must ensure an ethical system for their own management styles, personalities, systems, performances, plans, policies, strategies, productivity, [[openness]], and even risk(s) within their cultures or industries.

==Ethical system implementation==
The function of developing and implementing business ethics into an organization is difficult. Due to each organization's culture and atmosphere being different, there is no clear or specific way to implement a code of ethics to an existing business. Business ethics implementation can be categorized into two groups; formal and informal measures. Formal measures include training and courses pertaining to ethics. Informal measures are led by example from either the manager or the social norm of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belak |first=Jernej|date=2011|title=Informal and Formal Institutional Measures of Business Ethics Implementation at Different Stages of Enterprise Life Cycle |url=http://uni-obuda.hu/journal/Belak_Milfelner_27.pdf |journal=Acta Polytechnica Hungarica |volume=8 |number=1 |pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several steps to follow when trying to implement an ethical system. Some of these steps include obtaining a commitment from the board of directors and senior managers, developing resources for ethics initiatives, and determining ethical risks and developing contingency plans. Other steps include developing an ethics program that addresses risks while still maintaining compliance with the ethical standards, providing insight for implementation and audits of the ethical programs, and communicating with stakeholders to create shared commitment and values for ethical conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Cases|last=Fraedrich|first=John|publisher=South Western College |year=1990 |isbn=9781111825164|location=|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation should be performed to the entirety of the business including all areas of operations. If it is not implemented pragmatically and with caution for the needs, desires, and personalities (consider the [[Big Five personality traits]]) of the stakeholders, the culture, and the employees, then problems may arise. Although a great deal of time may be required, stakeholder management should consider the [[Rational Decision-Making Model]] for implementation of various aspects, details, and standards of an ethical system to the stakeholders. If an implementation has been performed successfully, then all stakeholders have accepted the newly designed ethics system for the organization.With the implementation of an ethical system comes the implementation of new tasks and responsibilities. The responsibilities include leadership in ethics, delegating, and communicating as well as motivating the company’s ethical position to its employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy |first=Patrick |date=1998 |title=Implementing Business Ethics |hdl=10822/827633 |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |volume=7 |pages=907-915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olscamp''' (August 29, 1937 – October 14, 2014) was a Canadian-American academic and university administrator, born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. While attending the [[University of Western Ontario]], Olscamp was a member of the [[Delta Upsilon]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://duwestern.org/notable-alumni|title=Delta Upsilon at the University of Western Ontario|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926104041/http://duwestern.org/notable-alumni|archivedate=2010-09-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] and Master of Arts degrees in 1958 and 1960, respectively. He received his [[doctorate]] in [[philosophy]] from the [[University of Rochester]] in 1962, the first such degree awarded there. His continuing love of the subject was evident during his time at [[Bowling Green State University]] (BGSU) because he taught a philosophy course almost every semester, despite managing all his duties as president.

He served as Dean of Faculties at Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois, from 1970 to 1972.  He also taught one course each semester, including seminars on the philosophy of George Berkeley.

Olscamp served as president of [[Western Washington University]] for seven years, from 1975 to 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://westerntoday.wwu.edu/news/in-memoriam-paul-olscamp|title=In memoriam: Paul Olscamp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While president of BGSU, he held a position on the [[board of directors]] of the [[American Association of State Colleges and Universities]]. He was appointed to the National Council on the Humanities by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1987.

The '''processing fluency theory of aesthetic pleasure'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0804_3|pmid=15582859|title=Processing Fluency and Aesthetic Pleasure: Is Beauty in the Perceiver's Processing Experience?|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|volume=8|issue=4|pages=364–382|year=2004|last1=Reber|first1=Rolf|last2=Schwarz|first2=Norbert|last3=Winkielman|first3=Piotr}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a theory in [[psychological aesthetics]] on how people experience [[beauty]]. [[Processing fluency]] is the ease with which information is processed in the human mind.

==Overview==
The [[theory]] is based on four basic assumptions:

#Objects differ in the fluency with which they can be processed. Variables that facilitate fluent processing include objective features of [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]], like [[Principles of grouping#Good Form|goodness of form]], [[Gestalt psychology#Pr.C3.A4gnanz|symmetry]], [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure-ground contrast]], as well as experience with a stimulus, like [[Mere-exposure effect|repeated exposure]] or prototypicality. 
#Processing fluency is itself hedonically marked (that is, it possesses an inherent [[Affective|affective quality]]) and high fluency is subjectively experienced as positive.&lt;ref&gt;Winkielman, P., Schwarz, N., Fazendeiro, T., &amp; Reber, R. (2003). The hedonic marking of processing fluency: Implications for evaluative judgment. In J. Musch &amp; K. C. Klauer (Eds.), ''The Psychology of Evaluation: Affective Processes in Cognition and Emotion''. (pp. 189-217). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#In line with the "feelings-as-information" account,&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, N., &amp; Clore, G. L. (2007). Feelings and phenomenal experiences. In E. T. Higgins &amp; A. W. Kruglanski (Eds.), ''Social Psychology: Handbook of basic principles'' (2nd ed., pp. 385-407). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; processing fluency feeds into judgments of aesthetic appreciation because people draw on their subjective experience in making evaluative judgments, unless the informational value of the experience is called into question. 
#The impact of fluency is moderated by expectations and [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]]. On one hand, fluency has a particularly strong impact on affective experience if there are no expectations (that is, its source is unknown and fluent processing comes as a surprise). On the other hand, the fluency-based affective experience is discounted as a source of relevant information when the perceiver attributes the experience to an irrelevant source. This helps explain the inverted U-shaped function often found in research on the effect of complexity on preferences:&lt;ref&gt;Berlyne, D. E. (1971). ''Aesthetics and psychobiology''. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt; very complex patterns are not judged as beautiful because they are disfluent, and patterns are judged as more beautiful when they become less complex. When viewers perceive a simple pattern, they are often able to detect the source of fluency—the pattern's simplicity—and do not use this experience of ease for judging the beauty of the pattern.

The processing fluency theory of aesthetic pleasure emphasizes the interaction between the viewer and an object in that it integrates theories and a wide range of [[empirical evidence]] that focus on effects of objective stimulus attributes on perceived beauty&lt;ref&gt;[[George David Birkhoff|Birkhoff, G. D.]] (1933). ''Aesthetic measure''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with those that emphasize the role of experience, for example by invoking prototypicality.&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C., &amp; Moore, K. (1988). Priming, prototypicality, and preference. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance'', ''14'', 661–670.&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, beauty is seen as an experience that has nothing to do with artistic merit: Beautiful works of art may be without any merit whereas good art is not necessarily beautiful.

The theory resolves the apparent paradox of [[Nature versus nurture|inborn and acquired preferences]]. For instance, infants prefer consonant melodies. According to the fluency account, this is because infants share perceptual equipment that make them process consonance in music more easily than dissonance. When children grow up, they are exposed to the music of their culture, resulting in culture-specific musical fluency. This familiarization explains why individuals from different cultures have different musical tastes. In addition, the theory helps explain why beauty (in a wide sense; perhaps the term ''elegance'' is more apt) is a cue for truth in mathematical problem solving and scientific discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, N. (2006). On judgments of truth &amp; beauty. ''Daedalus'', ''135'', 136–138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3758/PBR.15.6.1174|title=The use of heuristics in intuitive mathematical judgment|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=15|issue=6|pages=1174–1178|year=2008|last1=Reber|first1=Rolf|last2=Brun|first2=Morten|last3=Mitterndorfer|first3=Karoline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17189">The phrase '''Reverence for Life''' is a translation of the [[German language|German]] phrase: '''"{{lang|de|Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben}}"'''.  These words came to [[Albert Schweitzer]] on a boat trip on the [[Ogooué River]] in [[French Equatorial Africa]] (now [[Gabon]]), while searching for a universal concept of [[ethics]] for our time.

Schweitzer made the phrase the basic tenet of an ethical [[philosophy]], which he developed and put into practice. He gave expression to its development in numerous books and publications during his life and also in manuscripts which have recently been published; the main work being his unfinished four-part "[[Philosophy of culture]]" ({{lang-de|Kulturphilosophie}}) subtitled: "The World-view of Reverence for Life". He also used his [[Albert Schweitzer Hospital|hospital]] in [[Lambaréné]] in [[Gabon]] (Central Africa) to demonstrate this philosophy in practice.

He believed that '''Reverence for Life''' is a concept that develops from observation of the world around us. In 'Civilization and Ethics' he expressed this in these words:

{{quote |"Ethics is nothing other than Reverence for Life.

Reverence for Life affords me my fundamental principle of morality, namely, that good consists in maintaining, assisting and enhancing life, and to destroy, to harm or to hinder life is evil." | Albert Schweitzer}}

James Brabazon (Author of the  Biography of [[Albert Schweitzer]]) defined Reverence for Life with the following statement:

{{quote |"Reverence for Life says that the only thing we are really sure of is that we live and want to go on living. This is something that we share with everything else that lives, from elephants to blades of grass—and, of course, every human being. So we are brothers and sisters to all living things, and owe to all of them the same care and respect, that we wish for ourselves."| James Brabazon}}

[[Albert Schweitzer]] hoped that the ethic of Reverence for Life would make its way in the world on the basis of his explanation of it in his books and talks, the example of his life and the force of its own argument based on the depth of fundamental thought. To some extent this is taking place as is evidenced by the growth of the environmental movement. (The book ''[[Silent Spring]]'', by [[Rachael Carson]], which is widely credited with helping launch the environmental movement,&lt;ref&gt;Josie Glausiusz. (2007), Better Planet: Can A Maligned Pesticide Save Lives? ''Discover Magazine''.  Page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; was dedicated to [[Albert Schweitzer]]).

==Origins of Albert Schweitzer’s "Reverence for Life"==

Albert Schweitzer believed that ethical values which could underpin the ideal of true [[civilization]] had to have their foundation in deep thought and be world- and life-affirming. He therefore embarked on a search for [[ethical value]]s in the various major religions and world-views accessible to him, but could not find any that were able, unequivocally, to combine ethics with life-affirmation. It was not until two years after moving out to [[Gabon]] to establish the [[hospital|Albert Schweitzer Hospital]] that he finally found the simple statement which answered his quest.

In his autobiography "Out of My Life and Thought," Schweitzer explains this process.

"Having described how at the beginning of the summer of 1915 he awoke from some kind of mental daze, asking himself why he was only criticizing civilization and not working on something constructive.".&lt;ref&gt;''Out of My Life and Thought : An Autobiography.'' [''Aus meinem Leben und Denken''.] Albert Schweitzer, author.  Antje Bultmann Lemke , translator. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; 60th Anniversary Edition (June 11, 2009). p147. {{ISBN|0801894123}}&lt;/ref&gt; He relates how he asked himself the question:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But what is civilization?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The essential element in civilization is the ethical perfecting of the individual as well as society. At the same time, every spiritual and every material step forward has significance for civilization. The will to civilization is, then, the universal will to progress that is conscious of the ethical as the highest value. In spite of the great importance we attach to the achievements of science and human prowess, it is obvious that only a humanity that is striving for ethical ends can benefit in full measure from material progress and can overcome the dangers that accompany it.....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The only possible way out of chaos is for us to adopt a concept of the world based on the ideal of true civilization.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;But what is the nature of that concept of the world in which the will to the general progress and the will to the ethical progress join and are linked?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It consists in an ethical affirmation of the world and of life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is affirmation of the world and of life?....&lt;ref&gt;''Out of My Life and Thought : An Autobiography.'' [''Aus meinem Leben und Denken''.] Albert Schweitzer, author.  Antje Bultmann Lemke , translator. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; 60th Anniversary Edition (June 11, 2009). p148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For months on end, I lived in a continual state of mental agitation. Without the least success I concentrated - even during my daily work at the hospital - on the real nature of the affirmation of life and of ethics, and on the question of what they have in common. I was wandering about in a thicket where no path was to be found. I was pushing against an iron door that would not yield....&lt;ref&gt;''Out of My Life and Thought : An Autobiography.'' [''Aus meinem Leben und Denken''.] Albert Schweitzer, author.  Antje Bultmann Lemke , translator. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; 60th Anniversary Edition (June 11, 2009). p154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In that mental state, I had to take a long journey up the river . . . Lost in thought, I sat on deck of the barge, struggling to find the elementary and universal concept of the ethical that I had not discovered in any philosophy. I covered sheet after sheet with disconnected sentences merely to concentrate on the problem. Two days passed. Late on the third day, at the very moment when, at sunset, we were making our way through a herd of hippopotamuses, there flashed upon my mind, unforeseen and unsought, the phrase : “'''Reverence for Life'''”. [lang|de| Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben] The iron door had yielded. The path in the thicket had become visible. Now I had found my way to the principle in which affirmation of the world and ethics are joined together!” &lt;ref&gt;''Out of My Life and Thought : An Autobiography.'' [''Aus meinem Leben und Denken''.] Albert Schweitzer, author.  Antje Bultmann Lemke , translator. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; 60th Anniversary Edition (June 11, 2009). pp154-55. Emphasis added. [This edition leaves out the original German phrase, so another edition needs to be cited as well which contains the German phrase as shown above.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;-- [[Albert Schweitzer]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

According to some authors, Schweitzer's thought, and specifically his development for reverence for life, was influenced by [[Indian religions|Indian religious]] thought and in particular [[Jain]] principle of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (non-violence).&lt;ref&gt;Ara Paul Barsam (2002) "Albert Schweitzer, jainism and reverence for life" in:''Reverence for life: the ethics of Albert Schweitzer for the twenty-first century'' Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8156-2977-1}} p. 207-08&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Schweitzer has noted the contribution of Indian influence in his book ''Indian Thought and Its Development'':&lt;ref&gt;Albert Schweitzer and Charles Rhind Joy (1947) ''Albert Schweitzer: an anthology'' Beacon Press&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The laying down of the commandment to not kill and to not damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history of mankind. Starting from its principle, founded on world and life denial, of abstention from action, ancient Indian thought - and this is a period when in other respects ethics have not progressed very far - reaches the tremendous discovery that ethics know no bounds. So far as we know, this is for the first time clearly expressed by Jainism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It should not be overlooked, however, that as a child he felt deeply for the suffering of all the creatures around him. It beat upon him. He wrote, "As far back as I can remember I was saddened by the amount of misery I saw in the world around me. Youth's unqualified joie de vivre I never really knew...One thing especially saddened me was that the unfortunate animals had to suffer so much pain and misery....It was quite incomprehensible to me -- this was before I began going to school -- why in my evening prayers I should pray for human beings only. So when my mother had prayed with me and had kissed me good-night, I used to add silently a prayer that I composed myself for all living creatures. It ran thus: "O heavenly Father, protect and bless all things that have breath guard them from all evil, and let them sleep in peace...." &lt;ref&gt;''Albert Schweitzer: Essential Writings'', compiled by James Brabazon. p. 117-120&lt;/ref&gt;

Schweitzer twice went fishing with some boys "because they asked [him] to" and "this sports was soon made impossible for me by the treatment of the worms that were put on the hook...and the wrenching of the mouths of the fishes that were caught. I gave it up...From experiences like these, which moved my heart....there slowly grew up in me an unshakeable conviction that we have no right to inflict suffering and death on another living creature, and that we ought all of us to feel what a horrible thing it is to cause suffering and death..." &lt;ref&gt;''Albert Schweitzer: Essential Writings'', compiled by James Brabazon. p. 117–120&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Reverence for Life was incipient in Schweizer almost from birth.

This awareness affected him throughout his life, as when he would carefully, gently scoop a spider out of a hole it had fallen into before planting a crop there, to feed his patients and their families who also worked on the hospital farm. He wrote that, just as our own existence is significance to each of us, "[a creature's] existence is significant to it."&lt;ref&gt;''Reverence for Life: The Words of Albert Schweitzer''. compiled by Harold E. Robles. Pub. Harpercollins; 1st edition (October 1993). {{ISBN|0060670983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote that "...my relation to my own being and to the objective world is determined by reverence for life. This reverence for life is given as an element of my will-to-live..." and this will-to-live existed in all creatures and was to be respected.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophy of Civilization.'' Albert Schweitzer. Prometheus Books (March 1, 1987). {{ISBN|0879754036}}. p xv. See also this same topic of will-to-live in ''Out of My Life and Thought.''&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child he was taught, and later as an adult taught his congregations, the "fundamental truths of the religion of Jesus as something not hostile to reason, but, on the contrary, as strengthening them." &lt;ref&gt;''Out of My Life and Thought : An Autobiography.'' [''Aus meinem Leben und Denken''.] Albert Schweitzer, author.  Antje Bultmann Lemke, translator. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; 60th Anniversary Edition (June 11, 2009). p 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many later thanked him, saying that this teaching had "helped them to keep their religion in later life."  A great mind, he went through "heaps of books" which were piled so high he had to make aisles to get through them.&lt;ref&gt;''Out of My Life and Thought : An Autobiography.'' [''Aus meinem Leben und Denken''.] Albert Schweitzer, author.  Antje Bultmann Lemke, translator. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; 60th Anniversary Edition (June 11, 2009). pp 46 and 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied the life of Jesus in a depth few have ever achieved. His own philosophy, which came to be encapsulated in the phrase Reverence for Life, had this bedrock in the Four Gospels of the New Testament.

In his book ''The Philosophy of Civilization'', Schweitzer wrote, "Ethics are responsibility without limit toward all that lives....Love means more, since it includes fellowship in suffering, in joy, and in effort...&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophy of Civilization.'' Albert Schweitzer. Prometheus Books (March 1, 1987). {{ISBN|0879754036}}. p  317.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Will to Live==

The word ‘will’ in the sense of determination or firmness of purpose is rarely used today and therefore Schweitzer’s use of the word as translated from the German word ‘Wille’ may appear unfamiliar. However, it is a significant part of Schweitzer’s message. He held the view in the 1920s that people had largely lost touch with their own will, having subjugated it to outside authority and sacrificed it to external circumstances.

He therefore pointed back to that elemental part of ourselves that can be in touch with our ‘will’ and can exercise it for the good of all.

In ''Out of My Life and Thought'' Schweitzer wrote:

{{Quote|The most immediate fact of man’s consciousness is the assertion "I am life that wills to live in the midst of life that wills to live"|Albert Schweitzer&lt;ref&gt;A. Schweitzer, ''Out of my Life and Thought'' (Johns Hopkins University Press 1998), 156.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Affirmation of life is the spiritual act by which man ceases to live thoughtlessly and begins to devote himself to his life with reverence in order to give it true value. To affirm life is to deepen, to make more inward, and to exalt the will to live.

At the same time the man who has become a thinking being feels a compulsion to give to every will to live the same reverence for life that he gives to his own.[....] This is the absolute, fundamental principle of ethics, and is a fundamental postulate of thought.| Albert Schweitzer&lt;ref&gt;A. Schweitzer, ''Out of my Life and Thought'' (Johns Hopkins University Press 1998), 157.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his search for an answer to the problems posed by what was to him the obvious decline of western civilization, Albert Schweitzer was not prepared to give up the belief in progress which is so much taken for granted by people of European descent. Rather, he sought to identify why this ‘will to progress’ was seemingly going off the rails and causing the disintegration of European civilization.

He came to the following conclusion: (''Out of my Life and Thought'')

{{Quote|By itself, the affirmation of life can only produce a partial and imperfect civilization. Only if it turns inward and becomes ethical can the will to progress attain the ability to distinguish the valuable from the worthless. We must therefore strive for a civilization that is not based on the accretion of science and power alone, but which cares most of all for the spiritual and ethical development of the individual and of humankind.|Albert Schweitzer&lt;ref&gt;A. Schweitzer, ''Out of my Life and Thought'' (Johns Hopkins University Press 1998), 152.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Standing, as all living beings are, before this dilemma of the will to live, a person is constantly forced to preserve his own life and life in general only at the cost of other life. If he has been touched by the ethic of reverence for life, he injures and destroys life only under a necessity he cannot avoid, and never from thoughtlessness. |Albert Schweitzer&lt;ref&gt;A. Schweitzer, ''Out of my Life and Thought'' (Johns Hopkins University Press 1998), 236.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5734">'''Robert Frodeman''' Professor and former Chair, Dept of [[Philosophy]] and Religion Studies, [[University of North Texas]], previously at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], is Director of UNT's Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity. A student of [[Alphonso Lingis]] and [[Stanley Rosen]], Frodeman works in the areas of [[environmental ethics]] and [[environmental philosophy]], the philosophy of geology, and the philosophy of science policy, and has written an extensive body of peer-reviewed academic work in these areas. Throughout his work he emphasizes the role that philosophy can play in addressing ongoing societal controversies such as [[acid mine drainage]], [[global climate change]], and [[Hurricane Katrina]]. His most recent work focuses on the theory and practice of interdisciplinary approaches to knowledge. Frodeman also is part of UNT's emphasis on 'field philosophy' where philosophers emphasize working with scientists, engineers, and policy makers rather than an extensive focus on writing and working with other philosophers.

As of the fall of 2008 Frodeman is the founding director of UNT's Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity (CSID). CSID focuses on identifying best practices for interdisciplinary research and education, and views the last 100 years of disciplinarity across the academy as breaking down under the pressure of complex problems and the overproduction of knowledge. Frodeman is also the editor of the Oxford Handbook of Interdisciplinarity (2010), second edition forthcoming 2015.

==Biography==
Frodeman attended [[St. Louis University]], where he gained degrees in History and Philosophy, [[Pennsylvania State University]], where he obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Philosophy]], and the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], where he then obtained a [[Master's degree|M.S. degree]] in [[Geology]]. In the 1990s he consulted for the [[US Geological Survey]] on questions of science policy.

His research focuses on environmental philosophy and public policy and the theory and practice of interdisciplinary research and education. The UNT PhD program in Philosophy that he directs emphasizes 'field' approaches to philosophy where philosophers work with scientists, engineers, and policy makers.

He has written 100 articles, has authored or edited 10 books, and has held grants and awards totaling $2 million. From 2001 he directed the interdisciplinary project New Directions: Science, Humanities, Policy [http://www.ndsciencehumanitiespolicy.org/]—absorbed by CSID in 2008. CSID was closed in 2014.

He is the author or editor of:

'''Sannyasa''' ({{IAST|saṃnyāsa}}) is the life stage of renunciation within the [[Hindu]] philosophy of four age-based life stages known as [[ashrama (stage)|ashrama]]s, with the first three being [[Brahmacharya]] (bachelor student), [[Grihastha]] (householder) and [[Vanaprastha]] (forest dweller, retired).&lt;ref name="rks"/&gt; Sannyasa is traditionally conceptualized for men or women in late years of their life, but young brahmacharis have had the choice to skip the householder and retirement stages, renounce worldly and materialistic pursuits and dedicate their lives to spiritual pursuits.

Sannyasa is a form of asceticism, is marked by renunciation of material desires and prejudices, represented by a state of disinterest and detachment from material life, and has the purpose of spending one's life in peaceful, love-inspired, simple spiritual life.&lt;ref&gt;S. Radhakrishnan (1922), The Hindu Dharma, International Journal of Ethics, 33(1): 1-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DP Bhawuk (2011), The Paths of Bondage and Liberation, in Spirituality and Indian Psychology, Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, pages 93-110&lt;/ref&gt; An individual in Sanyasa is known as a '''Sannyasi''' (male) or '''Sannyasini''' (female) in [[Hinduism]],{{refn|group=note|An alternate term for either is sannyasin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alessandro Monti|title=Hindu Masculinities Across the Ages: Updating the Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OlvXAAAAMAAJ|year=2002|publisher=L'Harmattan Italia|isbn=978-88-88684-03-1|pages=41, 101–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} which in many ways parallel to the [[Sadhu]] and Sadhvi traditions of [[Jain monasticism]], the [[bhikkhu]]s and [[Bhikkhunī|bhikkhunis]] of [[Buddhism]] and the [[monk]] and [[nun]] traditions of [[Christianity]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey J. Sindima (2009), Introduction to Religious Studies, University Press of America, {{ISBN|978-0761847618}}, pages 93-94, 99-100&lt;/ref&gt;

Sannyasa has historically been a stage of renunciation, [[ahimsa]] (non-violence) peaceful and simple life and spiritual pursuit in Indian traditions. However, this has not always been the case. After the invasions and establishment of Muslim rule in India, from the 12th century through the [[British Raj]], parts of the [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] and [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] ascetics metamorphosed into a military order, to rebel against persecution, where they developed martial arts, created military strategies, and engaged in guerrilla warfare.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; These warrior ''sanyasis'' (ascetics) played an important role in helping European [[colonialism|colonial powers]] establish themselves in India.&lt;ref name=pinch/&gt;

==Etymology and synonyms==
''{{IAST|Saṃnyāsa}}'' in [[Sanskrit]] nyasa means purification, sannyasa means "Purification of Everything".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html saMnyAsa] Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; It is a composite word of [[copulative a|{{IAST|saṃ-}}]] which means "together, all", ''ni-'' which means "down" and ''{{IAST|āsa}}''  from the root ''{{IAST|as}}'', meaning "to throw" or "to put".&lt;ref name=asmw/&gt; A literal translation of Sannyāsa is thus "to put down everything, all of it". Sannyasa is sometimes spelled as ''Sanyasa''.&lt;ref name=asmw&gt;Angus Stevenson and Maurice Wait (2011), Concise Oxford English Dictionary, {{ISBN|978-019-9601080}}, page 1275&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Saṃnyasa'' makes appearance in the [[Samhita]]s, [[Aranyaka]]s and [[Brahmana]]s, the earliest layers of [[Vedas|Vedic literature]] (2nd millennium BCE), but it is rare.&lt;ref name=olivelleshs265/&gt; It is not found in ancient Buddhist or Jaina vocabularies, and only appears in Brahmanical literature of the 1st millennium BCE, in the context of those who have given up ritual activity and taken up non-ritualistic spiritual pursuits discussed in the [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref name=olivelleshs265/&gt; The term ''Sannyasa'' evolves into a rite of renunciation in ancient [[Sutra]] texts, and thereafter became a recognized, well discussed stage of life (Ashrama) by about the 3rd and 4th century CE.&lt;ref name=olivelleshs265/&gt;

In Dravidian languages, "sannyasi" is pronounced as "sanyasi" and also "sannasi" in colloquial form. Sanyasis are also known as Bhiksu, Pravrajita/Pravrajitā,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=pravrajitA&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 pravrajitA] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Yati,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=yatin&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 yatin] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Sramana and Parivrajaka in Hindu texts.&lt;ref name=olivelleshs265&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1981), Contributions to the Semantic History of Saṃnyāsa, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 101, No. 3, pages 265-274&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jamison and [[Michael Witzel|Witzel]] state&lt;ref name=jamwitz&gt;Jamison and Witzel (1992), [http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/vedica.pdf Vedic Hinduism], Harvard University Archives, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; early Vedic texts make no mention of ''Sannyasa'', or ''Ashrama system'', unlike the concepts of [[Brahmacharya|Brahmacharin]] and [[Grihastha]] which they do mention.&lt;ref&gt;JF Sprockhoff (1981), Aranyaka und Vanaprastha in der vedischen Literatur, Neue Erwägungen zu einer alten Legende und ihren Problemen. Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde Südasiens und Archiv für Indische Philosophie Wien, 25, pages 19-90&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]] uses the term ''Antigriha'' (अन्तिगृह) in hymn 10.95.4, still part of extended family, where older people lived in ancient India, with an outwardly role.&lt;ref name=jamwitz/&gt; It is in later Vedic era and over time, ''Sannyasa'' and other new concepts emerged, while older ideas evolved and expanded. A three-stage Ashrama concept along with [[Vanaprastha]] emerged about or after 7th Century BC, when sages such as [[Yajnavalkya|Yājñavalkya]] left their homes and roamed around as spiritual recluses and pursued their ''Pravrajika'' (wanderer) lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;JF Sprockhoff (1976), Sanyāsa, Quellenstudien zur Askese im Hinduismus I: Untersuchungen über die Sannyåsa-Upaninshads, Wiesbaden, {{oclc|644380709}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explicit use of the four stage Ashrama concept, appeared a few centuries later.&lt;ref name=jamwitz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Olivelle]] (1976), Vasudevåśrama Yatidharmaprakåśa: a treatise on world renunciation, Brill Netherlands, {{oclc|4113269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, early Vedic literature from 2nd millennium BC, mentions ''[[Rishi|Muni]]'' (मुनि, monks, mendicants, holy man), with characteristics that mirror those found in later ''Sannyasins'' and ''Sannyasinis''. [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]], for example, in Book 10 Chapter 136, mentions munis as those with ''Kesin'' (केशिन्, long haired) and ''Mala'' clothes (मल, soil-colored, yellow, orange, saffron) engaged in the affairs of ''Mananat'' (mind, meditation).&lt;ref name=gsg&gt;GS Ghurye (1952), Ascetic Origins, Sociological Bulletin, Vol. 1, No. 2, pages 162-184;&lt;br&gt;For Sanskrit original: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.१३६ Rigveda] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;For English translation: [https://archive.org/stream/hymnsrigveda00unkngoog#page/n588/mode/2up Kesins] Rig Veda, Hymn CXXXVI, Ralph Griffith (Translator)&lt;/ref&gt; Rigveda, however, refers to these people as ''Muni'' and ''Vati'' (वति, monks who beg).

{{quote|
&lt;nowiki&gt;केश्यग्निं केशी विषं केशी बिभर्ति रोदसी । केशी विश्वं स्वर्दृशे केशीदं ज्योतिरुच्यते ॥१॥

मुनयो वातरशनाः पिशङ्गा वसते मला । वातस्यानु ध्राजिं यन्ति यद्देवासो अविक्षत ॥२॥&lt;/nowiki&gt;

He with the long loose locks (of hair) supports Agni, and moisture, heaven, and earth; He is all sky to look upon: he with long hair is called this light. The '''Munis''', girdled with the wind, wear garments of soil hue; They, following the wind's swift course, go where the Gods have gone before.|Rig Veda|Hymn 10.CXXXVI.1-2&lt;ref name=gsg/&gt;}}

These ''Munis'', their lifestyle and spiritual pursuit, likely influenced the Sannyasa concept, as well as the ideas behind the ancient concept of [[Brahmacharya]] (bachelor student). One class of ''Munis'' were associated with Rudra.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Llewellyn Basham]], ''The Origins and Development of Classical Hinduism'', {{oclc|19066012}}, {{ISBN|978-0807073001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another were ''Vratyas''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Lifestyle and goals==
[[File:People of Varanasi 006.jpg|thumb|A Hindu Sannyasi. In ancient and medieval literature, they are usually associated with forests and remote hermitages in their spiritual, literary and philosophical pursuits.]]
[[File:Sunrise, Dinajpur, Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|A Hindu monk is walking during sunrise in a mango garden Dinajpur, Bangladesh.]]
Hinduism has no formal demands nor requirements on the lifestyle or spiritual discipline, method or deity a Sanyasin or Sanyasini must pursue – it is left to the choice and preferences of the individual.&lt;ref name=mk&gt;M Khandelwal (2003), Women in Ochre Robes: Gendering Hindu Renunciation, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791459225}}, pages 24-29&lt;/ref&gt; This freedom has led to diversity and significant differences in the lifestyle and goals of those who adopt Sannyasa. There are, however, some common themes. A person in ''Sannyasa'' lives a simple life, typically detached, itinerant, drifting from place to place, with no material possessions or emotional attachments. They may have a walking stick, a book, a container or vessel for food and drink, often wearing yellow, [[Saffron (color)|saffron]], orange, [[ochre]] or soil colored clothes. They may have long hair and appear disheveled, and are usually vegetarians.&lt;ref name=mk/&gt; Some minor Upanishads as well as monastic orders consider women, children, students, fallen men (those with a criminal record) and others as not qualified to become ''Sannyasa''; while other texts place no restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;In practice, women for example, entered Sannyasa in enough numbers that Chanakya's [[Arthashastra]] in 3rd century BC, mentions women ascetics (प्रव्रजिता, ''pravrajitā'') in several chapters; see for example, R. Shamasastry (Translator) [https://archive.org/stream/Arthasastra_English_Translation/Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_-_English#page/n159/mode/2up Chapter 23] page 160; also page 551&lt;/ref&gt; The dress, the equipage and lifestyle varies between groups. For example, Sannyasa Upanishad in verses 2.23 to 2.29, identifies six lifestyles for six types of renunciates.&lt;ref name=aar&gt;A. A. Ramanathan, [http://merki.lv/vedas/Upanishadas/Sannyasa%20Upanishad%20_eng_.pdf Sannyasa Upanishad] The Theosophical Publishing House, Chennai, verses 2.23 - 2.29&lt;/ref&gt; One of them is described as living with the following possessions,&lt;ref name=mdh2&gt;Mariasusai Dhavamony (2002), Hindu-Christian Dialogue: Theological Soundings and Perspectives, {{ISBN|978-9042015104}}, page 97&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
Pot, drinking cup and flask – the three supports, a pair of shoes,&lt;br&gt;
a patched robe giving protection – in heat and cold, a loin cloth,&lt;br&gt;
bathing drawers and straining cloth, triple staff and coverlet.
|Sannyasa Upanishad|1.4&lt;ref name=mdh2/&gt;}}

Those who enter Sannyasa may choose whether they join a group (mendicant order). Some are [[anchorite]]s, homeless mendicants preferring solitude and seclusion in remote parts, without affiliation.&lt;ref name=ht1/&gt; Others are [[Cenobitic monasticism|cenobites]], living and traveling with kindred fellow-Sannyasi in the pursuit of their spiritual journey, sometimes in Ashramas or Matha/Sangha (hermitages, monastic order).&lt;ref name=ht1&gt;SS Subramuniyaswami, {{Google books|9XC9bwMMPcwC|The Two Paths of Dharma|page=102}}, in What Is Hinduism? (Editors of Hinduism Today), Jan-Mar 2006, {{ISBN|978-1934145005}}, page 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Hindu ascetics adopt [[celibacy]] when they begin Sannyasa. However, there are exceptions, such as the Saiva Tantra school of asceticism where ritual sex is considered part of liberation process.&lt;ref name=gavin&gt;[[Gavin Flood]] (2005), The Ascetic Self: Subjectivity, Memory and Tradition, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521604017}}, Chapter 4 with pages 105-107 in particular&lt;/ref&gt; Sex is viewed by them as a transcendence from a personal, intimate act to something impersonal and ascetic.&lt;ref name=gavin/&gt;

===The goal===
The goal of the Hindu Sannyasin is [[moksha]] (liberation).&lt;ref&gt;A Bhattacharya (2009), Applied Ethics, Center for Applied Ethics and Philosophy, Hokkaido University, {{ISBN|978-4990404611}}, pages 63-64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Fort and Patricia Mumme (1996), Living Liberation in Hindu Thought, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2706-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of what that means varies from tradition to tradition.

{{Quote|
Who am I, and in what really do I consist? What is this cage of suffering?|Jayakhya [[Samhita]]|Verse 5.7&lt;ref name=gavin/&gt;}}

For the [[Bhakti]] (devotion) traditions, liberation consists of union with the Divine and release from [[Saṃsāra]] (rebirth in future life);&lt;ref&gt;NE Thomas (1988), Liberation for Life: A Hindu Liberation Philosophy, [[Missiology: An International Review]], 16(2): 149-162&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Yoga]] traditions, liberation is the experience of the highest [[Moksha#S.C4.81mkhya.2C Yoga and mok.E1.B9.A3a|Samādhi]] (deep awareness in this life);&lt;ref&gt;Knut Jacobsen (2011), in Jessica Frazier (Editor), The Bloomsbury companion to Hindu studies, Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1472511515}}, pages 74-83&lt;/ref&gt; and for the [[Advaita]] tradition, liberation is [[Moksha#Vedanta and mok.E1.B9.A3a|jivanmukti]] – the awareness of the Supreme Reality ([[Brahman]]) and Self-realization in this life.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (1985), Mokṣa and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, 35(1): 61-71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Fort (1998), Jivanmukti in Transformation, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-3904-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sannyasa is a means and an end in itself. It is a means to decreasing and then ultimately ending all ties of any kind. It is a means to the soul and meaning, but not ego nor personalities. Sannyasa does not abandon the society, it abandons the ritual mores of the social world and one's attachment to all its other manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Denton (2004), Female Ascetics in Hinduism, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791461808}}, page 100&lt;/ref&gt; The end is a liberated, content, free and blissful existence.&lt;ref&gt;M Khandelwal (2003), Women in Ochre Robes: Gendering Hindu Renunciation, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791459225}}, pages 34-40, 173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P Van der Veer (1987), Taming the ascetic: Devotionalism in a Hindu monastic order, Man, 22(4): 680-695&lt;/ref&gt;

===The behaviors and characteristics===
{{Hinduism}}
The behavioral state of a person in ''Sannyasa'' is described by many ancient and medieval era Indian texts. Bhagavad Gita discusses it in many verses, for example:&lt;ref name=jeaneane/&gt;

{{Quote|
ज्ञेयः स नित्य'''संन्यासी''' यो न द्वेष्टि न काङ् क्षति &lt;nowiki&gt;। निर्द्वन्द्वो हि महाबाहो सुखं बन्धात्प्रमुच्यते ॥५-३॥&lt;/nowiki&gt;

He is known as a permanent '''Sannyasin''' who does not hate, does not desire, is without dualities (opposites). Truly, Mahabaho ([[Arjuna]]), he is liberated from bondage.|[[Bhagavad Gita]]|Hymn 5.3&lt;ref name=jeaneane&gt;English Translation 1: Jeaneane D. Fowler (2012), The Bhagavad Gita: A Text and Commentary for Students, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1845193461}}, page 93;&lt;br&gt;English Translation 2: Edwin Arnold, [[s:The Bhagavad Gita (Arnold translation)/Chapter 5|Bhagavad Gita]] Chapter 5, Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other behavioral characteristics, in addition to renunciation, during Sannyasa include: [[ahimsa]] (non-violence), [[akrodha]] (not become angry even if you are abused by others), disarmament (no weapons), chastity, bachelorhood (no marriage), avyati (non-desirous), amati (poverty), self-restraint, truthfulness, sarvabhutahita (kindness to all creatures), [[asteya]] (non-stealing), [[aparigraha]] (non-acceptance of gifts, non-possessiveness) and [[shaucha]] (purity of body speech and mind).&lt;ref name=mdh&gt;Mariasusai Dhavamony (2002), Hindu-Christian Dialogue: Theological Soundings and Perspectives, {{ISBN|978-9042015104}}, page 96-97, 111-114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Powell (2010), Windows Into the Infinite: A Guide to the Hindu Scriptures, Asian Humanities Press, {{ISBN|978-0875730714}}, pages 292-297&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hindu monastic orders require the above behavior in form of a vow, before a renunciate can enter the order.&lt;ref name=mdh/&gt; Tiwari notes that these virtues are not unique to ''Sannyasa'', and other than renunciation, all of these virtues are revered in ancient texts for all four ''Ashramas'' (stages) of human life.&lt;ref&gt;KN Tiwari (2009), Comparative Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802933}}, pages 33-35&lt;/ref&gt;

Baudhayana [[Dharmasutra|Dharmasūtra]], completed by about 7th century BC, states the following behavioral vows for a person in ''Sannyasa''&lt;ref name=mmbd2&gt;[[Max Muller]] (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/pt2sacredlawsof14bhuoft#page/278/mode/2up Baudhayana Dharmasūtra Prasna II, Adhyaya 10, Kandika 18], The [[Sacred Books of the East]], Vol. XIV, Oxford University Press, pages 279-281&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
These are the vows a Sannyasi must keep –

Abstention from injuring living beings, truthfulness, abstention from appropriating the property of others, abstention from sex, liberality (kindness, gentleness) are the major vows. There are five minor vows: abstention from anger, obedience towards the guru, avoidance of rashness, cleanliness, and purity in eating. He should beg (for food) without annoying others, any food he gets he must compassionately share a portion with other living beings, sprinkling the remainder with water he should eat it as if it were a medicine.
|[[Baudhayana]]|Dharmasūtra, II.10.18.1-10&lt;ref name=mmbd2/&gt;}}

Ashrama Upanishad identified various types of Sannyasi renouncers based on their different goals:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=fB8uneM7q1cC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;sig=P6KLLIhkzqHKk0fR9HeLtT5xXdE|title=The Samnyasa Upanisads: Hindu Scriptures on Asceticism and Renunciation|publisher=|pages=98–99|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kutichaka – seeking atmospheric world; Bahudaka – seeking heavenly world; Hamsa – seeking penance world; [[Paramahamsa]] – seeking truth world; and Turiyatitas and Avadhutas seeking liberation in this life.

In some texts, such as Sannyasa Upanishad,&lt;ref name=aar/&gt; these were classified by the symbolic items the Sannyasins carried and their lifestyle. For example, Kutichaka sannyasis carried triple staffs, Hamsa sannyasis carried single staffs, while Paramahamsas went without them. This method of classification based on emblematic items became controversial, as anti-thematic to the idea of renunciation. Later texts, such as Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad stated that all renunciation is one, but people enter the state of Sannyasa for different reasons – for detachment and getting away from their routine meaningless world, to seek knowledge and meaning in life, to honor rites of Sannyasa they have undertaken, and because he already has liberating knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=fB8uneM7q1cC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;sig=P6KLLIhkzqHKk0fR9HeLtT5xXdE|title=The Samnyasa Upanisads: Hindu Scriptures on Asceticism and Renunciation|publisher=|page=99|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Other classifications
There were many groups of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist Sannyasis co-existing in pre-Maurya Empire era, each classified by their attributes, such as:&lt;ref&gt;MM Singh (1967), {{Google books|O-00Ip4W1BUC|Life in North-Eastern India in Pre-Mauryan Times}}, Motilal Banarsidass, pages 131-139&lt;/ref&gt; Achelakas (without clothes), Ajivika, Aviruddhaka, Devadhammika, Eka-satakas, Gotamaka, Jatilaka, Magandika, Mundasavaka, Nigrantha (Jains), Paribbajaka, Tedandikas, Titthiya and others.

==Literature==
[[Image:Swami Vivekananda 1896.jpg|thumb|[[Swami Vivekananda]] (1894) was a sannyasi.]]
The [[Dharmaśāstra#Principal Root Texts|Dharmasūtra]]s and [[Dharmaśāstra#The Dharma.C5.9B.C4.81stras|Dharmaśāstra]]s, composed about mid 1st millennium BC and later, place increasing emphasis on all four stages of ''Ashrama system'' including ''Sannyasa''.&lt;ref name=bhold/&gt; The [[Baudhayana]] Dharmasūtra, in verses 2.11.9 to 2.11.12, describes the four Ashramas as "a fourfold division of [[Dharma]]". The older Dharmasūtras, however, are significantly different in their treatment of ''Ashramas'' system from the more modern Dharmaśāstras, because they do not limit some of their Ashrama rituals to ''[[dvija]]'' men, that is, the three ''varnas'' – Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas.&lt;ref name=bhold&gt;Barbara Holdrege (2004), Dharma, in The Hindu World (Editors: Sushil Mittal and Gene Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|0 41521527-7}}, page 231&lt;/ref&gt; The newer Dharmaśāstra vary widely in their discussion of ''Ashrama'' system in the context of classes (castes),&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Olivelle|1993|pp=25–34}} translates them as classes, e.g. see footnote 70; while other authors translate them as castes&lt;/ref&gt; with some mentioning it for three, while others such as ''Vaikhānasa Dharmasūtra'' including all four.&lt;ref name=paol/&gt;

The [[Dharmasutra|Dharmasūtra]]s and [[Dharmaśāstras]] give a number of detailed but widely divergent guidelines on renunciation. In all cases, Sannyasa was never mandatory and was one of the choices before an individual. Only a small percentage chose this path. Olivelle&lt;ref name=paol&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1993), The Ashrama System: The History and Hermeneutics of a Religious Institution, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195344783}}&lt;/ref&gt; posits that the older Dharmasūtras present the ''Ashramas'' including ''Sannyasa'' as four alternative ways of life and options available, but not as sequential stage that any individual must follow.&lt;ref name=bhold/&gt; Olivelle also states that ''Sannyasa'' along with the Ashrama system gained mainstream scholarly acceptance about 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1993), The Ashrama System: The History and Hermeneutics of a Religious Institution, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195344783}}, page 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism consider ''Grihastha'' (householder) stage as the most important of all stages in sociological context, as human beings in this stage not only pursue a virtuous life, they produce food and wealth that sustains people in other stages of life, as well as the offsprings that continues mankind.&lt;ref name=rks&gt;RK Sharma (1999), Indian Society, Institutions and Change, {{ISBN|978-8171566655}}, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alban Widgery (1930), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2377977 The Principles of Hindu Ethics], International Journal of Ethics, 40(2): 232-245&lt;/ref&gt; However, an individual had the choice to renounce any time he or she wanted, including straight after student life.&lt;ref name=wih&gt;What is Hinduism? (Editors of Hinduism Today), {{Google books|9XC9bwMMPcwC|Two noble paths of Dharma|page=101}}, Family Life and Monastic Life, Chapter 10 with page 101 in particular&lt;/ref&gt;

===When can a person renounce?===
Baudhayana Dharmasūtra,&lt;ref name=mmbd/&gt; in verse II.10.17.2 states that anyone who has finished [[Brahmacharya]] (student) life stage may become ascetic immediately, in II.10.17.3 that any childless couple may enter Sannyasa anytime they wish, while verse II.10.17.4 states that a widower may choose Sannyasa if desired, but in general, states verse II.10.17.5, Sannyasa is suited after the completion of age 70 and after one's children have been firmly settled.&lt;ref name=mmbd&gt;[[Max Muller]] (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/pt2sacredlawsof14bhuoft#page/272/mode/2up Baudhayana Dharmasūtra Prasna II, Adhyaya 10, Kandika 17], The Sacred Books of the East, Vol. XIV, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Other texts suggest the age of 75.&lt;ref&gt;Dharm Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology: Lessons from the Bhagavad-Gita, Springer Science, {{ISBN|978-1441981097}}, page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''{{IAST|Vasiṣṭha}}'' and ''Āpastamba Dharmasūtra''s, and the later ''{{IAST|[[Manusmṛti]]}}'' describe the ''āśrama''s as sequential stages which would allow one to pass from Vedic studentship to householder to forest-dwelling hermit to renouncer.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Olivelle|1993|pp=84–106}} discussion of the development of the ''āśrama'' system in "Renouncer and Renunciation in the ''Dharmaśāstras''."&lt;/ref&gt; However, these texts differ with each other. [[Yājñavalkya Smṛti]], for example, differs from Manusmṛti and states in verse 3.56 that one may skip [[Vanaprastha]] (forest dwelling, retired) stage and go straight from the ''Grihastha'' (householder) stage to ''Sannyasa''.

===Who may renounce?===
The question as to which ''{{IAST|vaṛṇa}}'' may, or may not, renounce is never explicitly stated in ancient or medieval dharma literature, the more modern Dharmaśāstras texts discuss much of renunciation stage in context of ''[[dvija]]'' men.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Olivelle|1993|p=111}}, "Renouncer and Renunciation in the ''Dharmaśāstras.''" p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Dharmaśāstra texts document people of all castes as well as women, entered ''Sannyasa'' in practice.&lt;ref&gt;For more references to renunciation by Śūdras and women, see {{harv|Olivelle|1993|pp=111–115}}, "Renouncer and Renunciation in the ''Dharmaśāstras.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

===What happened to renouncers' property and human rights?===
After renouncing the world, the ascetic's financial obligations and property rights were dealt by the state, just like a dead person.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Olivelle|1993|pp=89–91}}, ''{{IAST|Saṃnyāsa Upaniṣads}}''&lt;/ref&gt; Viṣṇu Smriti in verse 6.27, for example, states that if a debtor takes ''Sannyasa'', his sons or grandsons should settle his debts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/institutesvishn00jollgoog#page/n88/mode/2up Law of Debt] Vishnu Smriti, Julius Jolly (Translator), page 45&lt;/ref&gt; As to the little property a Sannyasin may collect or possess after renunciation, Book III Chapter XVI of Kautiliya's [[Arthashastra]] states that the property of hermits (vánaprastha), ascetics (yati, sannyasa), and student bachelors (Brahmachári) shall on their death be taken by their ''guru'', disciples, their ''dharmabhratri'' (brother in the monastic order), or classmates in succession.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Arthashastra/Book III|Arthashastra - CHAPTER XVI: RESUMPTION OF GIFTS, SALE WITHOUT OWNERSHIP AND OWNERSHIP]] Book III, Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a renouncer's practitioner's obligations and property rights were reassigned, he or she continued to enjoy basic human rights such as the protection from injury by others and the freedom to travel. Likewise, someone practicing Sannyasa was subject to the same laws as common citizens; stealing, harming, or killing a human being by a Sannyasi were all serious crimes in Kautiliya's Arthashastra.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [[s:Arthashastra/Book IV|Arthasastra - CHAPTER X: Fines in Lieu of Mutilation of Limbs]] Book IV, Wikisource; see also Book IV, Chapter XI which declared murder of an ascetic as a capital crime.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renunciation in daily life===
Later Indian literature debates whether the benefit of renunciation can be achieved (''moksha,'' or liberation) without asceticism in the earlier stages of one's life. For example, [[Bhagavad Gita]], Vidyaranya's ''Jivanmukti Viveka,'' and others believed that various alternate forms of [[yoga]] and the importance of yogic discipline could serve as paths to spirituality, and ultimately ''moksha''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew O. Fort and Patricia Y. Mumme (1996), Living Liberation in Hindu Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791427057}}, pages 8-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (2005), The Ascetic Self: Subjectivity, Memory and Tradition, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521604017}}, pages 60-74&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, four paths to liberating spirituality have emerged in Hinduism: Jñāna yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Rāja yoga.&lt;ref&gt;Thor Johansen (2009), Religion and Spirituality in Psychotherapy: An Individual Psychology Perspective, Springer, {{ISBN|978-0826103857}}, pages 148-154&lt;/ref&gt; Acting without greed or craving for results, in Karma yoga for example, is considered a form of detachment in daily life similar to ''Sannyasa''. Sharma&lt;ref name=ash/&gt; states that, "the basic principle of Karma yoga is that it is not what one does, but how one does it that counts and if one has the know-how in this sense, one can become liberated by doing whatever it is one does", and "(one must do) whatever one does without attachment to the results, with efficiency and to the best of one's ability".&lt;ref name=ash&gt;A Sharma (2000), Classical Hindu Thought: An Introduction, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195644418}}, pages 24-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warrior ascetics==
[[File:Basawan. Battle of rival ascetics. Akbarnama, ca. 1590, V&amp;A Museum.jpg|200px|thumb|The [[Mughal Army]] commanded by Akbar attack members of the Sannyasa during the [[Battle of Thanesar]].]]
Ascetic life was historically a life of renunciation, non-violence and spiritual pursuit. However, in India, this has not always been the case. For example, after the Mongol and Persian Islamic invasions in the 12th century, and the establishment of [[Delhi Sultanate]], the ensuing Hindu-Muslim conflicts provoked the creation of a military order of Hindu ascetics in India.&lt;ref name=david&gt;David N. Lorenzen (1978), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/600151 Warrior Ascetics in Indian History], Journal of the American Oriental Society, 98(1): 61-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pinch&gt;William Pinch (2012), Warrior Ascetics and Indian Empires, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-1107406377}}&lt;/ref&gt; These warrior Ascetics, formed paramilitary groups called ‘‘[[Akhara]]s’’ and they invented a range of martial arts.&lt;ref name=david/&gt;

''Nath Siddhas'' of the 12th century AD, may have been the earliest Hindu monks to resort to a military response after the Muslim conquest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alf Hiltebeitel]], Their name is Legion, in Rethinking India's Oral and Classical Epics, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226340500}}, page 332-334 and footnote 104 on page 333&lt;/ref&gt; Ascetics, by tradition, led a nomadic and unattached lifestyle. As these ascetics dedicated themselves to rebellion, their groups sought stallions, developed techniques for spying and targeting, and they adopted strategies of war against Muslim nobles and the Sultanate state. Many of these groups were devotees of Hindu deity [[Shiva|Mahadeva]], and were called ''Mahants''.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; Other popular names for them was ''Sannyasis'', ''Yogis'', ''Nagas'' (followers of Shiva), ''Bairagis'' (followers of Vishnu) and ''[[Gosains]]'' from 1500 to 1800 AD; in some cases, these Hindu monks cooperated with Muslim fakirs who were Sufi and also persecuted.&lt;ref name=pinch/&gt;

Warrior monks continued their rebellion through the Mughal Empire, and became a political force during the early years of [[British Raj]]. In some cases, these regiments of soldier monks shifted from guerrilla campaigns to war alliances, and these Hindu warrior monks played a key role in helping British establish themselves in India.&lt;ref&gt;P van der Veer (2007), Book Review, The American Historical Review, 112(1): 177-178,{{doi|10.1086/ahr.112.1.177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of warrior ascetics rapidly declined with the consolidation of British Raj in late 19th century, and with the rise in non-violence movement by [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref name=david/&gt;

Novetzke states that some of these Hindu Warrior Ascetics were treated as folk heroes, aided by villagers and townspeople, because they targeted figures of political and economic power in a discriminatory state, and some of these warriors paralleled [[Robin Hood]]'s lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Novetzke (2011), Religion and Public Memory: A Cultural History of Saint Namdev in India, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231141857}}, pages 173-175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sannyasa Upanishads==
Of the 108 [[Upanishad]]s of the [[Muktika]], the largest corpus is dedicated to ''Sannyasa'' and to [[Yoga]], or about 20 each, with some overlap. The renunciation-related texts are called the Sannyasa Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1998), Upaniṣhads. Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199540259}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are as follows:

Among the thirteen major or [[Principal Upanishads]], all from the ancient era, many include sections related to ''Sannyasa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Patrick| last=Olivelle|year=1992|title= The Samnyasa Upanisads|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 978-0195070453| pages=x-xi, 4–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the motivations and state of a ''Sannyasi'' are mentioned in [[Maitrayaniya Upanishad|Maitrāyaṇi Upanishad]], a classical major Upanishad that Robert Hume included among his list of "Thirteen Principal Upanishads" of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Robert Ernest|last=Hume|title=[https://archive.org/details/thirteenprincipa028442mbp ''The Thirteen Principal Upanishads'']|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maitrāyaṇi starts with the question, "given the nature of life, how is joy possible?" and "how can one achieve [[moksha]] (liberation)?"; in later sections it offers a debate on possible answers and its views on Sannyasa.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen (Translator), Sixty Upanisads of the Veda, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 327-386&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
In this body infected with passions, anger, greed, delusion, fright, despondency, grudge, separation from what is dear and desirable, attachment to what is not desirable, hunger, thirst, old age, death, illness, sorrow and the rest - how can one experience only joy? – Hymn I.3

The drying up of great oceans, the crumbling down of the mountains, the instability of the pole-star, the tearing of the wind-chords, the sinking down, the submergence of the earth, the tumbling down of the gods from their place - in a world in which such things occur, how can one experience only joy ?! – Hymn I.4

{{Quote|
Dragged away and polluted by the river of the ''[[Guṇa|Gunas]]'' (personality), one becomes rootless, tottering, broken down, greedy, uncomposed and falling in the delusion of I-consciousness, he imagines: "I am this, this is mine" and binds himself, like a bird in the net. – Hymn VI.30

Just as the fire without fuel comes to rest in its place,&lt;br&gt;
so also the passive mind comes to rest in its source;&lt;br&gt;
When it (mind) is infatuated by the objects of sense, he falls away from truth and acts;&lt;br&gt;
Mind alone is the ''[[Saṃsāra|Samsara]]'', one should purify it with diligence;&lt;br&gt;
You are what your mind is, a mystery, a perpetual one;&lt;br&gt;
The mind which is serene, cancels all actions good and bad;&lt;br&gt;
He, who, himself, serene, remains steadfast in himself - he attains imperishable happiness. – Hymn VI.34

Six of the Sannyasa Upanishads – Aruni, Kundika, Kathashruti, Paramahamsa, Jabala and Brahma – were composed before the 3rd-century CE, likely in the centuries before or after the start of the common era, states Sprockhoff; the Asrama Upanishad is dated to the 3rd-century, the Naradaparivrajaka and Satyayaniya Upanishads to around the 12th-century, and about ten of the remaining Sannyasa Upanishads are dated to have been composed in the 14th- to 15th-century CE well after the start of Islamic Sultanates period of South Asia in late 12th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Patrick| last=Olivelle|year=1992|title= The Samnyasa Upanisads|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 978-0195070453| pages=x-xi, 8–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Joachim F|last=Sprockhoff|year=1976|title=Samnyasa: Quellenstudien zur Askese im Hinduismus|publisher=Wiesbaden: Kommissionsverlag Franz Steiner|language=German| isbn=978-3515019057|pages=277–294, 319–377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sedona''''' is a 2011 comedy-drama film directed by Tommy Stovall. The plot concerns the experiences of an advertising executive and a lawyer in [[Sedona, Arizona]]. Released theatrically in 2012, the film's cast includes [[Frances Fisher]], [[Seth Peterson]], [[Barry Corbin]], [[Christopher Atkins]], [[Lin Shaye]], and [[Beth Grant]].&lt;ref name="Sedona"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allmovie.com/movie/sedona-v551563/  | publisher=[[AllMovie]] | title=Sedona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film contains two stories that take place in [[Sedona, Arizona]]. One story involves a successful advertising executive named Tammy ([[Frances Fisher]]) who, on her birthday, is driving from Portland to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] to land the biggest client of her career until a wrong turn gets her lost and takes her into Sedona by mistake, where she is run off the highway by a tour plane making an emergency landing and right in the middle of town, and so she is forced to wait in Sedona while her damaged car is being repaired. Across town, a lawyer named Scott ([[Seth Peterson]]) is hiking in the woods with his partner Eddie (Matt Williamson) and their two young sons. Eddie brought the workaholic Scott to Sedona for some rest and relaxation, but wind up in an unexpected adventure when 7-year-old Denny (Trevor Sterling Stovall) gets lost. The ensuing frantic search for Denny sends Scott into a profound life-changing journey that forces him to examine his own priorities and determine what's truly important in his life. Meanwhile, Tammy unwittingly begins a spiritual transformation of her own as she encounters an array of the townspeople, each of them touching her in different meaningful ways. A chain of coincidences spirals her out of control, leaving her haunted by her past and forcing her to face her demons head on. Letting her guard down, she confronts the implausible possibility that she has been brought to Sedona for a reason.

'''Simon L'vovich Soloveychik''' (1930-1996) was a Russian publicist, educator and social philosopher.

== Brief biography ==

Simon Soloveychik was born in a [[Jewish]] family. His father, Lev I. Soloveychik, was editor, writer and administrator at the ''Krasnaya Zvezda'' ("Red Star") newspaper, and later managed the Moscow-based Voienizdat publishing house. After graduating from the Philology Department of [[Moscow State University]] in 1953 Simon worked as a boys and girls scouts leader, a secondary school teacher, and a correspondent of ''Pioneer'' magazine.
In 1960 he worked for the newspaper ''Komsomolskaya Pravda'', where he launched a wide theme named "Aly parus" (Scarlet Sail), where he published articles on [[humanism]] and [[morality]].

In mid-1980 he initiated a new scientific-practical pedagogical movement - pedagogy of cooperation. From that perspective upbringing of a child was considered not as an influence upon a child but as a dialog between educator and a student. He also regularly published pedagogical articles in the ''Novoe vremya'' (''New Time'') magazine.

In 1992 Soloveychik founded and lead the newspaper ''Pervoe sentyabrya'' (''First of September''), which promoted humanistic pedagogical ideas.

In 1994 Simon Soloveychik wrote the manifest "Chelovek Svobodny" ([http://www.parentingforeveryone.com/freeman "Free Man"]), in which he briefly and clearly wrote the basic philosophical ideas of upbringing of a free man, and he gave definitions of such concepts as internal [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]] and [[conscience]], explained what a free child is, what a free school is, and what the way to raising free men is.

== [[Parenting For Everyone]] ==

The main work of his life is his book ''Pedagogika dlya vseh'' ([[Parenting For Everyone]]) (1977-1986), where he shared his philosophical insights on the [[Objective (goal)|goal]]s, means and conditions of [[parenting]] free children; he explained how to raise the [[heart]], [[intelligence]] and [[spirit]] of a free man, and underlined the faults of conventional approaches to parenting.
According to Soloveychik, parenting is the science about the art of upbringing children. The main idea in upbringing is that parents by all means should increase a child's [[dignity]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Soloveychik was a classic member of the Russian intelligentsia, focused on underlying ideas and their significance, rather than on what was practical or expedient. He wrote always in defense of teachers and their work... Perhaps the organizing idea of Soloveychik's work was expressed in a remark he … made to a visiting American educator who wanted Soloveychik's reaction to some new psychological theory. "You know," said Simon L'vovich, "everyone thinks that the essence of pedagogy is in [[psychology]], but it's not. The essence of pedagogy is in [[ethics]]." It would be a fitting epitaph for this courageous writer and intellectual." — '' from obituary by Stephen Kerr 10/18/96

'''Stephen Gaukroger''', (born 9 July 1950) is a British/Australian [[Philosophy#History of philosophy|historian of philosophy]] and [[History of science|science]]. He is Emeritus Professor of History of Philosophy and [[History of Science]] at the [[University of Sydney]]. 

== Life ==
Stephen Gaukroger was born in Oldham, Lancashire, and educated at Cardinal Langley Grammar School. He studied Philosophy at Birkbeck College, University of London, where he was awarded first class honours with the official congratulations of the Board of Examiners. He was a graduate student at Darwin College, Cambridge, completing his PhD in 1977 in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science.

In 1977 he was elected to a research fellowship at Clare Hall, Cambridge, and at the end of 1978 moved to a research fellowship at the University of Melbourne. In 1981 he took up a lectureship in philosophy at the University of Sydney. He married Helen Irving in 1980 and they have two children, Cressida (born 1986), and Hugh (born 1989). He divides his time between Sydney and London.

== Work ==
Gaukroger’s first publication was on Gaston Bachelard, and in the 1970s and early 1980s he wrote a number papers on classical philosophy and science, as well as on Marx, Euler, and Vico. But between the late 1970s and late 1990s he focused primarily on early modern philosophy, with books on Descartes and Bacon, including an intellectual biography of Descartes which placed his metaphysics and epistemology in the context of his natural philosophy. From the late 1990s onwards he has been concerned with a large-scale project on the emergence of a scientific culture, i.e. one in which all cognitive values come to be centred around scientific ones. Three volumes devoted to this question have appeared — ''The Emergence of a Scientific Culture: Science and the Shaping of Modernity, 1210-1685'' (2006), ''The Collapse of Mechanism and the Rise of Sensibility: Science and the Shaping of Modernity, 1680-1760'' (2010), and ''The Natural and the Human: Science and the Shaping of Modernity, 1739-1841'' (2016). The fourth and final volume, ''Civilization and The Culture of Science: Science and the Shaping of Modernity, 1795-1935'' will be published in 2019.

== Honours ==
Gaukroger was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Humanities in 1992, a Fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales in 2016, a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society in 2016, corresponding member of l’Académie Internationale d’Histoire des Sciences in 2007 and full member in 2016. In 2003 he was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal for contributions to history of philosophy and history of science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7736">"'''What is it like to be a bat?'''" is a paper by American philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]], first published in ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'' in October 1974, and later in Nagel's ''Mortal Questions'' (1979). In it, Nagel argues that [[Materialism|materialist]] [[Theory of mind|theories of mind]] omit the essential component of [[consciousness]], namely that there is something that it is (or feels) like to be a particular, conscious thing.&lt;ref name="Thomas Nagel 2010, p. 637"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Ted |editor-last=Honderich|title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=bJFCAwAAQBAJ|page=637}}|date=10 March 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-103747-4|first=Thomas |last=Nagel|p= 637}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that an organism has conscious mental states, "if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like ''for'' the organism to be itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nagel | first1 = Thomas | year = 1974 | title = What Is It Like to Be a Bat? | journal = The Philosophical Review | volume = 83 | issue = 4| pages = 435–450 | doi=10.2307/2183914 | jstor=2183914 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=fBGPBRX3JsQC|page=165}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]], a critic of Nagel's argument, nevertheless called this paper "the most widely cited and influential thought experiment about consciousness."&lt;ref name=Dennett1991&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel C.|title=[[Consciousness Explained]]|date=1991|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|441}}

==Summary==

The thesis attempts to refute [[reductionism]] (the philosophical position that a complex system is nothing more than the sum of its parts). For example, a [[physicalism|physicalist]] reductionist's approach to the [[mind–body problem]] holds that the mental process humans experience as [[consciousness]] can be fully described via physical processes in the brain and body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wimsatt|first=William C|title=Reductionism, Levels of Organization, and the Mind-Body Problem|year=1976|publisher=Springer US|isbn=978-1-4684-2198-9|pages=205–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nagel begins by arguing that the conscious experience is widespread, present in many animals (particularly [[mammal]]s), and that for an organism to have a conscious experience it must be special, in the sense that its [[qualia]] or "subjective character of experience" are unique. Nagel stated, “An organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism – something that it is like for the organism to be itself.”&lt;ref name="Thomas Nagel 2010, p. 637"/&gt;

The paper argues that the subjective nature of consciousness undermines any attempt to explain consciousness via objective, reductionist means. A subjective character of experience cannot be explained by a system of functional or intentional states. Consciousness cannot be explained without the subjective character of experience, and the subjective character of experience cannot be explained by a reductionist being; it is a mental phenomenon that cannot be reduced to [[materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Qualia {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/qualia/|website = www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for consciousness to be explained from a reductionist stance, the idea of the subjective character of experience would have to be discarded, which is [[Reductio ad absurdum|absurd]]. Neither can a physicalist view, because in such a world each phenomenal experience had by a conscious being would have to have a physical property attributed to it, which is impossible to prove due to the subjectivity of conscious experience. Nagel argues that each and every subjective experience is connected with a “single point of view,” making it unfeasible to consider any conscious experience as “objective”.

Nagel uses the metaphor of [[bat]]s to clarify the distinction between [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] concepts. Bats are mammals, so they are assumed to have conscious experience. Nagel used bats for his argument because of their highly evolved and active use of a biological sensory apparatus that is significantly different from that of many other organisms. Bats use [[Echolocation (animal)|echolocation]] to navigate and perceive objects. This method of perception is similar to the human sense of vision. Both [[sonar]] and vision are regarded as perceptional experiences. While it is possible to imagine what it would be like to fly, navigate by sonar, hang upside down and [[entomophagy|eat insects]] like a bat, that is not the same as a bat's perspective. Nagel claims that even if humans were able to metamorphose gradually into bats, their brains would not have been wired as a bat's from birth; therefore, they would only be able to experience the life and behaviors of a bat, rather than the mindset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Preester | first1 = Helena | year = 2007 | title = The deep bodily origins of the subjective perspective: Models and their problems | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 604–618 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2007.05.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such is the difference between subjective and objective points of view. According to Nagel, “our own mental activity is the only unquestionable fact of our experience”, meaning that each individual only knows what it is like to be them ([[Subjectivism]]). Objectivity, requires an unbiased, non-subjective state of perception. For Nagel, the objective perspective is not feasible, because humans are limited to subjective experience.

Nagel concludes with the contention that it would be wrong to assume that physicalism is incorrect, since that position is also imperfectly understood. Physicalism claims that states and events are physical, but those physical states and events are only imperfectly characterized. Nevertheless, he holds that physicalism cannot be understood without characterizing objective and subjective experience. That is a necessary precondition for understanding [[the mind-body problem]].

==Criticisms==

Dennett denies Nagel's claim that the bat's consciousness is inaccessible, contending that any "interesting or theoretically important" features of a bat's consciousness would be amenable to third-person observation.&lt;ref name=Dennett1991 /&gt;{{rp|442}} For instance, it is clear that bats cannot detect objects more than a few meters away because echolocation has a limited range. He holds that any similar aspects of its experiences could be gleaned by further scientific experiments.&lt;ref name=Dennett1991 /&gt;{{rp|443}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5482">'''William H. Goetzmann''' (July 20, 1930 – September 7, 2010) was an American historian and emeritus professor in the American Studies and American Civilization Programs at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. He attended [[Yale University]] as a graduate student and was friends with [[Tom Wolfe]] while there. His work on the American West won him the highest prizes for historians, the Parkman Prize and the Pulitzer Prize. He has written and published extensively on American philosophy, American political history, and the American arts.  An advocate for the importance of history as a public discussion, he has served in various capacities in television and film production, notably for [[PBS]]. He was most recently the Jack S. Blanton, Sr., Chair Emeritus in History and American Studies.  His last book published during his lifetime was ''Beyond the Revolution:  A History of American Thought From [[Thomas Paine|Paine]] to Pragmatism'' (2009).&lt;ref name="AAS01" /&gt;

==Biography==
William H. Goetzmann was born in Washington&lt;ref name="NYT01" /&gt; and raised in the American Midwest, notably in St. Paul, Minnesota, where his family once rented an apartment previously occupied by the bank robber [[John Dillinger]].&lt;ref name="AAS01"&gt;Jeff Salamon, "William H. Goetzmann Discusses "Beyond the Revolution," ''Austin American-Statesman'', April 12, 2009 , [http://www.statesman.com/life/content/life/stories/books/04/12/0412goetzmann.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dillinger-apartment experience was one of many that drew him to the study of history as a dramatic narrative populated by colorful individuals and sweeping movements. Educated at [[Yale University]] where he received BA and Ph.D. degrees, he taught at Yale from 1955 to 1964, with his interest in the history of the West sparked by the historian [[Howard R. Lamar]].&lt;ref name="NYT01" /&gt; He then moved to [[The University of Texas at Austin]] to develop its fledgling American Studies and American Civilization Programs.  His early writing concerned American diplomacy and American expansionism; in 1966, Alfred A. Knopf published his ''Exploration and Empire:  The Explorer and the Scientist in the Winning of the American West'', which rapidly won the two most prestigious prizes in American historical writing, the Parkman Prize and the Pulitzer Prize. Over the next 5 decades, he published widely, establishing himself as one of the nation's premiere historians, and ranging widely among intellectual history, cultural history, art history, history of science, and history of philosophy.  &lt;br /&gt;A devoted and influential teacher, he was mentor to [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur "Genius Award"]] winner [[Stephen J.

== Early life and education ==
Norman Fischer was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]] in 1946, and was raised in [[Pittston, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lQrFusMMVH0C&amp;pg=PA257&amp;lpg=PA257&amp;dq=Pittston+Pennsylvania+norman+fischer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oQnXj-nfRq&amp;sig=saSyursyEyhcoiO4fRPxZzsCNCw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiynMKw8M3UAhVP-GMKHRc2DeoQ6AEISTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Pittston%20Pennsylvania%20norman%20fischer&amp;f=false|title=The Three-Pound Enigma: The Human Brain and the Quest to Unlock Its Mysteries|last=Moffett|first=Shannon|date=2006-01-20|publisher=Algonquin Books|isbn=9781565128903|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child he attended services with his parents at a [[Conservative]] [[synagogue]].&lt;ref name="loundon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Loundon |first=Sumi |title=The Buddha's Apprentices: More Voices of Young Buddhists |publisher=Wisdom Publications |year=2006 |location=Boston |pages=125–130 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=CdCBgXgnXukC&amp;pg=PA125 |isbn=086171332X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a B.A. from [[Colgate University]], where he studied religion, philosophy, and literature, an M.F.A. in poetry from the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]],  and an M.A. in history and phenomenology of religion at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and the [[Graduate Theological Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.normanfischer.org/reviews-interviews-all/john-wright-language-and-emptiness-an-interview-with-norman-fischer|title=Language and emptiness: John Wright interviews Norman Fischer|work=Norman Fischer Books|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious practice ==

=== Zen training, service and teaching ===
From 1970 through 1976, Fischer trained at the [[Berkeley Zen Center]], a temple in the lineage of [[Shunryū Suzuki|Shunryu Suzuki]], under the guidance of [[Mel Weitsman|Sojun Mel Weitsman]]. In 1976, he and his wife moved to [[Tassajara Zen Mountain Center|Tassajara]], a training monastery near [[Big Sur]], where they lived as residential monastics for five years. In 1980, they were both ordained as Zen priests by [[Zentatsu Richard Baker]], from whom Fischer received the dharma name Zoketsu Rinsho. In 1981, they moved to [[Green Gulch Farm Zen Center]] in [[Marin County, California]], where Fischer served in various monastic positions including Director, Tanto (Head of Practice), and Co-Abbot from 1981 to 2000. During that time, in 1988, he received [[Dharma transmission]] from his longtime teacher, Sojun Mel Weitsman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfzc.org/zc/display.asp?catid=1,5&amp;pageid=426 San Francisco Zen Center: Lineage]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1995 to 2000, Fischer served as co-abbot of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] (SFZC), first with Sojun Mel Weitsman, and then with Zenkei [[Blanche Hartman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Prebish |first=Charles S. |author2=Martin Baumann  |title =Westward Dharma: Buddhism Beyond Asia |publisher=University of California Press |year =2002 |location=Berkeley |pages =226 |oclc=48871649 |isbn=0520226259}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his abbacy, Fischer supported the research, drafting and formal institution of a women’s lineage chant, alongside the traditional men’s lineage chant, during services. Later, with poet and translator [[Peter Levitt]], he supported the drafting of an official women’s lineage paper—the first female lineage document in the history of any major world religion—which traces the line of female practitioners from the Buddha’s time to the present and recognizes the important historical role of the Zen women ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/roused-dream/|title=Roused from a Dream|last=Fowles|first=Mary|work=Tricycle|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a senior Dharma teacher, Fischer continues to participate at the San Francisco Zen Center and its affiliate temples, giving talks and leading practice events. In 2000, he founded the Everyday Zen Foundation, which has practice groups in Canada, the United States and Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfzc.org/city-center/zen-meditation-practice/teachers/guest-teachers-lecturers/zoketsu-norman-fischer-senior-dharma-teacher|title=Zoketsu Norman Fischer (Senior Dharma Teacher) {{!}} San Francisco Zen Center|website=www.sfzc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer has also integrated Buddhist contemplative practices in business, law, and education—specifically for hospice workers, software engineers, and conflict resolution specialists. In 1987, Fischer founded (among others) the [[Zen Hospice Project]] at the San Francisco Zen Center, for which he served as board chair for over 20 years, and is now emeritus chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ramdass.org/norman-fischer/|title=RamDass: Norman Fischer|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a faculty member of the Metta Institute, a training institute for hospice caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mettainstitute.org/EOLfaculty.html|title=Metta : EOL Faculty|website=www.mettainstitute.org|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he developed (along with [[Chade-Meng Tan]], Mirabai Bush, Daniel Golemen and [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]]) the course on mindfulness and emotional intelligence, [[Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute|“Search Inside Yourself”]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/googles-chade-meng-tan-wants-you-to-search-inside-yourself-for-inner-and-world-peace/|title=Google's Chade-Meng Tan Wants You to Search Inside Yourself for Inner (and World) Peace - Knowledge@Wharton|work=Knowledge@Wharton|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was originally taught at Google’s program for employees, and has now been taught to over 20,000 people in more than 100 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://siyli.org/about|title=siyli.org {{!}} About|date=2017-06-21|website=siyli.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer is currently involved with conflict resolution work at Gary Friedman and Jack Himmelstein’s [http://understandinginconflict.org/ Center for Understanding in Conflict], where he trains conflict resolution professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://understandinginconflict.org/our-trainers/|title=Our Trainers {{!}} The Center for Understanding in Conflict|website=understandinginconflict.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also consulted with [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] chaplains about incorporating Zen practices into their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mountainx.com/arts/art-news/zen_judaism/|title=Zen Judaism|work=Mountain Xpress|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has taught and lectured at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Brown University|Brown]] and [[Stanford University|Stanford]] universities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ptreyesbooks.com/events/norman-fischer-0|title=Norman Fischer|last=uw|date=2016-01-03|website=Point Reyes Books|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014, he gave the baccalaureate address at Stanford University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/june/fischer-baccalaureate-text-061414.html|title=Prepared text of Zoketsu Norman Fischer's Baccalaureate address|work=Stanford University|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;He has also served as mentor to teenage boys; this experience is chronicled in his book ''Taking Our Places: The Buddhist Path to Truly Growing Up'' ([[HarperOne]], 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-050551-6|title=Book Review: Taking Our Places: The Buddhist Path to Truly Growing Up by Norman Fischer, Author  HarperOne $23.95 (208p)|ISBN=978-0-06-050551-6|work=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer also teaches Zen workshops and retreats on the importance of compassion practice, as modeled in his book, ''Training in Compassion: Zen Teachings on the Practice of Lojong'' ([[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Meditation|first=Seattle Insight|title=Training in Compassion: Zen Teachings on the Practice of Lojong|date=2013-09-11|url=https://vimeo.com/74347362|accessdate=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the subject of a Spring 2016 online course taught by Fischer, and offered through [[Tricycle Magazine]], in collaboration with San Francisco Zen Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.normanfischer.org/readings-workshops/2016/3/7/tricycle-online-courses-training-in-compassion|title=Tricycle Online Courses: Training in Compassion|website=Norman Fischer Books|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interreligious dialogue ===
Fischer is a proponent of [[interreligious dialogue]] between the worlds' religions, stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;"I feel that in our period it is the challenge of religious traditions to do something more than simply reassert and reinterpret their faiths, hoping for loyal adherents to what they perceive to be the true doctrine. Looking back at the last century, with its devastating wars and holocausts and the shock of ecological vulnerability, I have the sense that religious traditions must now have a wider mission, and it is in the recognition of this mission, I believe, that interreligious dialogue becomes something not only polite and interesting, but also essential."&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47136534|title=Purity of heart and contemplation : a monastic dialogue between Christian and Asian traditions|last=1931-|first=Barnhart, Bruno,|last2=Yuese.|first2=Huang,|date=2001|publisher=Continuum|isbn=082641348X|oclc=47136534}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He currently sits on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the [[Elijah Interfaith Institute]], an interreligious dialogue organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://elijah-interfaith.org/world-religious-leaders-activity/the-elijah-board-of-world-religious-leaders/buddhist-leaders|title=Buddhist Leaders|date=2015-04-27|work=Elijah Interfaith|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1996, he attended a five-day meeting between members of different religions held at [[Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani|The Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani]] in Trappist, Kentucky, where he gave a talk about [[Dōgen|Dogen]], [[zazen]], and the importance of religions coming together—despite their different philosophies—to serve humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/746900315|title=The Gethsemani encounter : a dialogue on the spiritual life by Buddhist and Christian monastics|last=1943-|first=Mitchell, Donald W.

Fischer has been active in the [[Jewish meditation]] movement since the 1990s, working at first with Rabbi Alan Lew, and now with rabbis and Jewish meditation teachers from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/2010/06/25/june-25-2010-norman-fischer-on-meditation/6533/|title=June 25, 2010 ~ Norman Fischer on Meditation {{!}} June 25, 2010 {{!}} Religion &amp; Ethics NewsWeekly {{!}} PBS|date=2010-06-25|work=Religion &amp; Ethics NewsWeekly|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2000, he and Rabbi Lew founded Makor Or, a Jewish Meditation Center in San Francisco, which Fischer now continues to direct, in the wake of Rabbi Lew’s 2009 death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jccsf.org/adult/adult-classes/makor-or-jewish-meditation/|title=JCCSF - Makor Or: Jewish Meditation|website=www.jccsf.org|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/2001/06/08/meditation-deepens-judaism-for-makor-or-participants/|title=Meditation deepens Judaism for Makor Or participants|last=admin|date=2001-06-08|website=J.|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer has written about the concept of [[God]] being integral to [[Judaism]] and many other religions. In his book ''Opening to You: Zen-Inspired Translations of the Psalms'' ([[Viking Press|Viking]], 2002), Fischer replaced the words "God", "King", and "Lord" with the word "You." He explains:&lt;blockquote&gt;"For many of the religious seekers I encounter, the word God has been all but emptied of its spiritual power. The relationship to God that is charted out in the Psalms is a stormy one, co-dependent, passionate, confusing, loyal, petulant, sometimes even manipulative. I wanted to find a way to approach these poems so as to emphasize the relational aspect, while avoiding the major distancing pitfalls that words like God, King, Lord and so on create."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/living/article/Buddhist-translation-of-biblical-Psalms-2772601.php|title='Buddhist' translation of biblical Psalms|work=SFGate|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Writing ==

=== Poetry ===
During Fischer’s years at The Iowa Writers’ Workshop, he met poets associated with the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry movement]] of the seventies and eighties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Miscellaneous/Language_and_Emptiness.html|title=thezensite:Language and emptiness: An interview with Norman Fischer|website=www.thezensite.com|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving his MFA in poetry from the University of Iowa&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://poetry.arizona.edu/people/norman-fischer|title=Norman Fischer|date=2015-01-28|work=Poetry Center|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1970, he moved to San Francisco where he remained associated with the movement, writing language-centered avant-garde poetry with a spiritual bent and publishing his first poems in 1979. His first collection ''Like a Walk Through a Park'' (Open Books, 1980) comprises poems written at Tassajara Zen Mountain Monastery, where he was in residence with poets [[Jane Hirshfield]] and [[Philip Whalen]]. After Whalen’s death in 2003, Fischer became his literary executor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/norman-fischer|title=Norman Fischer|date=2017-06-20|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer has since published over fifteen volumes of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.normanfischer.org/books-of-poetry/|title=Books of Poetry|website=Norman Fischer Books|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; His poetry has been published in literary magazines such as ''Talisman'', ''Jacket,'' ''Mag City, Fracture, Tinfish, Bezoar, Periodics, Bombay Gin, Raddle Moon, Gallery Works, Crayon'', and ''Antenym,'' among others, and anthologized in ''The Wisdom Anthology of North American Poetry,'' and ''Basta Azzez enough''.

[[Charles Bernstein]] has called Fischer’s poetry “illuminating and essential”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upaya.org/2015/10/norman-fischer-to-share-from-new-book-in-dharma-talk-tomorrow/|title=Norman Fischer to Share From New Book in Dharma Talk Tomorrow - Upaya Zen Center|date=2015-10-13|work=Upaya Zen Center|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ron Silliman]] says “nobody gives more completely of himself in the act of writing than Norman Fischer...I am in awe of this gift.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.normanfischer.org/books-poetry/the-strugglers|title=The Strugglers|work=Norman Fischer Books|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer is a founding board member of Poets in Need, an organization that grants emergency funds to poets in financial distress.

=== Non-fiction ===
Fischer has written nine books on Zen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.normanfischer.org/books-on-zen/|title=Books on Zen|website=Norman Fischer Books|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous essays and books on writing, poetry, and spirituality. His essays have been published in magazines such as ''Buddhadharma'', ''Tricycle'' and ''[[Shambhala Sun]]'', and in collections such as ''Radical Poetics and Secular Jewish Culture'' ([[University of Alabama Press]], 2010) and ''The Best Buddhist Writing'' (Shambhala Sun).

== Personal life ==

'''Žarko Puhovski''' (15 December 1946 in [[Zagreb]]) is a [[Croats|Croatian]] professor, political analyst, philosopher and intellectual, former president of the [[Croatian Helsinki Committee]].

==Biography==
Puhovski was born in [[Zagreb]] on 15 December 1946. He was born to a [[Jews|Jewish]] mother although he has never been an active Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2002/05/21/8915/CroatianJewsupset |title=Croatian paper demands Jews blast Israel |author=Vlasta Kovač |date=21 May 2002 |work=[[Vjesnik]] |publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] |accessdate=31 March 2013}}{{dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puhovski became well-known public figure at a very early age, for almost a trivial reason: When he became the president of his [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] committee of the Alliance of Socialist Youth a directive arrived to revitalise the political work with more vivacious subjects. Having discovered an article on [[Birth control|contraception]] in the magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' bought by his grandma, Puhovski found it a suitably "vivacious" subject and has on the school youth conference in 1964, in front of 400 students and all the teachers read an essay titled ''Love, sex and contraception''. Before the essay was read to the end, all the professors left the solemnly decked hall. After everything was over, Puhovski was expelled from the [[League of Communists of Croatia]]. [[Miko Tripalo]], the newly elected secretary of the City Committee of the League of Communists called for him, and told him: "''I also had adventures here and there, but I was never punished by the Party, not even by a reprimand! What have you, for god's sake, in this age managed to achieve that you're being expelled from the Party because of sex?''". After Tripalo realised what happened, he did his best to whitewash the halo of martyr of Puhovski and the punishment has been canceled.

After studying [[physics]] for two years he heads for [[Germany]], but returns in 1968 enrolling to the Faculty of Political Sciences. In December 1969 he was appointed as the editor-in-chief of the ''Omladinski tjednik'' ("Youth weekly"), taking only 4 months to be discharged. The newspapers he edited were banned for insulting the President of the Republic. It was in March 1970 that he published on the third page of the newspaper a critical introductory on the 10th assembly of the Central Committee of the Communists of Croatia, and on the last page he reprinted a text of the [[Ljubljana]]'s periodical ''[[Delo]]''. In the cinema shows schedule ''Delo'' has behind the title ''Filmske novosti - [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] u Tanzaniji'' ("Film news - Tito in Tanzania") brought a summary of film's plot, bu without the film's title. The summary went: ''Veliki boss sakupio je svoj tim - stručnjake za oružje, drogu i prostituciju - i krenuo u osvajanje svijeta.'' ("The great boss has gathered his team - experts for weapons, drug and the prostitution - and went to conquer the world"). Puhovski translated, magnified and published that text.

In 1971 he was a witness on the trial of Croatian student leaders ([[Dražen Budiša]], [[Ivan Zvonimir Čičak]]). Twenty years later, in a charged nationalist atmosphere, Puhovski has been for this trial depicted as an "anti-Croat" and "traitor" of his colleagues. However, Budiša stated some time later that there was nothing contentious in the testimony of Puhovski, and according to the words of [[Duško Čizmić Marović]]:
:''Puhovski told nothing that was not already known to the court before, he didn't charge us with some fabricated facts. He simply provided a lengthy account of his own, already known viewpoints... But I was shocked by this gesture of him: when he, in one moment, started to quote me by his memory, I interrupted him with words "I didn't say that!". In that moment Puhovski turned towards me - me who was on trial! - raised his hand asking me "Wanna bet?"''.{{cite quote|date=October 2017}}

From 1973 Puhovski works as an assistant in the Institute for Philosophy at the [[University of Zagreb]], and since 1975 he teaches [[political philosophy]] at the [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Philosophy]]. As a professor he held guest lectures at the Universities of [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], [[University of London|London]], [[University of Brighton|Brighton]], [[University of Klagenfurt|Klagenfurt]] and [[University of Valencia|Valencia]]. He is a member of The [[Ethikon Institute]] in [[Los Angeles]]. He is the scientific director of the [[European University Center for Peace Studies]] in [[Stadtschlaining]].

He served as an editor in various periodicals: ''[[Ideje]]'' (1970–1973); ''[[Kulturni radnik]]'' (1971–1982); ''[[Praxis (magazine)|Praxis]]'' (1973–1975); ''[[Teka (magazine)|Teka]]'' (1975); ''[[Filozofska istraživanja]]'' (1980–1986). He translated numerous books and studies from [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]], published about two hundred works in political philosophy, [[ethics]], philosophy of [[culture]], [[jurisprudence]] and [[social sciences]]. He is the co-founder of the first alternative Yugoslav political organisation UJDI (''Udruženje za Jugoslavensku demokratsku inicijativu'', "[[Association for Yugoslav Democratic Initiative]]") in 1988, and the [[Croatian Helsinki Committee]] (HHO) in 1993, of which he is president in the period 2000-2007. He was awarded with European Club of Rectors Extraordinary Award for Peace and against Xenophobia 1993.
