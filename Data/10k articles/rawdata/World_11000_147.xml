The '''1998 [[Lignes Aériennes Congolaises (1997-2003)|Lignes Aériennes Congolaises]] crash''' refers to a non-scheduled domestic [[Kindu]]–[[Kinshasa]] passenger service that was shot down by rebel forces, just after [[takeoff]] from [[Kindu Airport]], during climbout, on 10 October 1998.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt; All 41 occupants of the aircraft perished in the incident.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt;

==Aircraft==
The aircraft involved was a [[Lignes Aériennes Congolaises (1997-2003)|Lignes Aériennes Congolaises]] [[Boeing 727-30]], [[Aircraft registration|registration]] 9Q-CSG, that had its maiden flight on 10 March 1965.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FI"/&gt; The airframe was {{Age|1965|3|10|1998|10|10}} years old at the time of the crash.

==Description of the event==
The [[Lignes Aériennes Congolaises (1997-2003)|Lignes Aériennes Congolaises]] [[Boeing 727-30]] took off from [[Kindu]] Airport (KND/FZOA) on a domestic non-scheduled passenger flight to [[N'djili Airport]] in [[Kinshasa]] with 38 passengers and 3 crew on board. Only 3 minutes into the flight, the rear of the aircraft was struck by a Russian-made shoulder-fired [[Strela 2]] [[surface-to-air missile]]. The captain attempted an emergency landing, but the 727 crashed into a dense [[jungle]] near [[Kindu]]. All 41 people on board perished.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1824">The '''Second Soviet Antarctic Expedition''' was led by [[Aleksei Treshnikov]] on the continent; the marine expedition on the "Ob" was led by I. V. Maksimov. The "Ob" left Kaliningrad on 7 November, 1956.

Three ships were used to transport the expedition, all [[Marine_propulsion#Reciprocating_diesel_engines|diesel-electric]]. The two main ships were as for the first expedition: RV ''Ob'' (flagship; captain I. A. Man) and RV "Lena" (captain A. I. Vetrov). The third ship was ''Kooperatsiya'' (captain A. S. Yantselevich), used mainly as a transport vessel.

The tasks of the expedition were:

# Relief of the first expedition
# Full scale scientific work for the [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY) This included glacier mapping and wildlife tracking, among other things.
# Organisation of two IGY scientific stations near the south geomagnetic pole and pole of relative inaccessibility
# An inland tractor-sledge traverse for glaciology
# Oceanography

** '''Conectar Igualdad''': ARSAT is also in charge of leveraging the RFFO for this digital divide program.
** '''TDA''': ARSAT is also in charge of connecting the TDA terrestrial network through the RFFO.
* '''Data Center''': In its Benavidez ground station ARSAT has built and operates a {{convert|4200|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} TIER III certified [[data center]].
* '''[[CEATSA]]''': An environmental testing laboratory. While it is physically connected to [[INVAP]]'s satellite manufacturing facility, ARSAT holds a majority ownership (80% as of 2015).&lt;ref name=ceatsa-aboutus /&gt;

* '''''Libre.ar''' (cancelled)'': In December 2012, gave ARSAT a mandate to set up a [[cellular network]] that would be open to small operators.&lt;ref name=arglaw-decpres20122426 /&gt; This was possible because the Government had kept a set of frequency bands for a national network operator.&lt;ref name=telam-2013027064 /&gt; The program never materialized and just 18 months later the frequencies were put up for auction.&lt;ref name=arglaw-decpres20140671 /&gt;&lt;ref name=infobae-1564189 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3844">The '''Asat Trust''' is a business in [[Liechtenstein]] which represents the interests of other businesses in that state.

== History ==

{{expand section|date=November 2012}}

== People ==

{{expand section|date=November 2012}}

* [[Erwin Wachter]] - company head as of 2003&lt;ref name="perelman_oil"/&gt;
* [[Martin Wachter]] - director as of 2003&lt;ref name="perelman_trail"/&gt;
* [[Prince Emanuel of Liechtenstein (1908-1987)|Prince Emanuel of Liechtenstein]] - board member (1970–1987)

== Notable Relationships ==

=== Al Taqwa ===

The Asat Trust has represented [[Al Taqwa Bank]], a business of [[Youssef Nada]] and [[Ali Ghaleb Himmat]],
which has been accused of financing [[al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref name="perelman_trail"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://forward.com/articles/6853/terror-fund-trail-leads-to-alpine-kingdom/
|title=Terror Fund Trail Leads To Alpine Kingdom
|first=Marc
|last=Perelman
|date=17 October 2003
|accessdate=24 November 2012
|publisher=Jewish Daily Forward
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawsuit filed by the family of [[John P. O'Neill]] describes Asat as a "money laundering organization" founded by [[Youssef Nada]]. &lt;ref name="oneill_suit"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://cryptome.org/oneill-v-iraq.htm
|title=Estate of John Patrick O'Neill v. Republic of Iraq, et al
|date=20 August 2003
|accessdate=24 November 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LGT Bank ===

Asat has a close relationship with [[LGT Group|the bank of the Liechtenstein royal family]] and has printed the name of that bank on its own letterhead.&lt;ref name="perelman_trail"/&gt;

It is common practice that a legal representative prints the name of a local bank on its own letterhead, indicating its own business account;

=== Galp Energia ===

The Asat Trust represented Portuguese energy company [[Galp Energia]] in its business dealings with Iraq in the [[Oil-for-Food Programme]]. When the US placed sanctions on Asat, Galp continued this business through [[Sercor Treuhand Anstalt]], a company closely related to Asat.&lt;ref name="perelman_oil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/issues/2003/03.06.20/news2.html |title=Oil for Food Sales Seen As Iraq Tie To Al Qaeda |first=Marc |last=Perelman |date=20 June 2003 |accessdate=24 November 2012 |publisher=Jewish Daily Forward |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308100115/http://www.forward.com/issues/2003/03.06.20/news2.html |archivedate=March 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sercor Treuhand Anstalt does not represent Galp Energia;

=== Wachter businesses ===
[[Sercor Treuhand Anstalt]], also known as SerMont Asset Management SA, is the business of Asat Trust directors [[Erwin Wachter]] and [[Martin Wachter]].

Martin Wachter also owns [[Turicon Asset Management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.quantscreener.com/CH/Interviews/20120718.php
|title=Mit Martin Wachter von Turicon Asset Management, Zurich
|first=Thomas
|last=Caduff
|date=18 July 2012
|accessdate=24 November 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sercor is not the business of "Asat" directors; Sercor Treuhand Anstalt and SerMont Asset Management are different companies; 
Erwin Wachter died November 2013;

=== Alleged Hamas relationship ===
[[File:FBI Special Agent Lara Burn's testimony.pdf|thumb|[[FBI Special Agent]] Lara Burn's testimony]]

Asat represented K &amp; A Overseas Trading, a business of [[Khairy H. Al-Agha]] and [[Saleh Kamel Jibreel]], which the US government alleged to finance [[Hamas]] in the [[Holy Land Foundation]] trial.&lt;ref name="mb_report_2007_aug_10"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://globalmbreport.org/?p=145
|title=Holy Land Documents Point to Hamas/Al Taqwa Relationship
|publisher=Global Muslim Brotherhood Report
|date=12 August 2007
|accessdate=24 November 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asat never represented the above companies; Asat was not involved in any financing as described above;

'''Bata Airport''' {{Airport codes|BSG|FGBT}} is an airport serving [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]] in [[Litoral (Equatorial Guinea)|Litoral]], [[Equatorial Guinea]]. It is the second largest airport in Equatorial Guinea after [[Malabo Airport]].

==Overview==
[[File:CEIBA Intercontinental ATR 42-500 SDV-1.jpg|thumb|[[CEIBA Intercontinental]] [[ATR 42]]s at Bata Airport]]
The airport is {{convert|4|km}} north of Bata and {{convert|3.8|km}} south of Utonde. It has a 2440-metre runway that operates only during the daytime and in good light. The state carrier and four other private companies make up the majority of Bata's industry, transporting passengers from Bioko's [[Malabo International Airport]] or the airports at [[Annobón Airport|Annobón]] or [[Mongomo]]. The airport is large enough to accommodate a [[Boeing 737]]. Bata served 15,000 passengers in 2001.

The Bata [[VOR-DME]] (ident: '''BTA''') and the Bata [[non-directional beacon]] (ident: '''BT''') are located on the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://skyvector.com/?ll=1.905469,9.805681&amp;chart=301&amp;zoom=1|title=SkyVector: Flight Planning / Aeronautical Charts|website=skyvector.com|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2002, all staff at the airport were arrested for allowing the leader of the Popular Union, an opposition party, to board a flight to [[Gabon]].

The '''Battle of Shimbra Kure''' ("[[chickpea]] swamp") was fought in March 1529 between the forces of [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]] led by [[Imam]] [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]], and the [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopian]] army, under [[Dawit II of Ethiopia|Dawit II]] (Lebna Dengel). The army of Imam Ahmad prevailed, and were in control of the field at the end of the battle. Both sides suffered heavy casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pankhurst, ''The Ethiopian Borderlands'' (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1997), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this success, and his desire to capture and hold the Emperor's palace at [[Badeqe]], Imam Ahmad, in part to appease his restive men, withdrew from the highlands and did not return to directly engage the Ethiopian army for two years.&lt;ref&gt;Sihab ad-Din Ahmad bin 'Abd al-Qader, ''Futuh al-Habasa: The conquest of Ethiopia'', translated by Paul Lester Stenhouse with annotations by Richard Pankhurst (Hollywood: Tsehai, 2003),p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authorities, such as [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]], attribute Imam Ahmad's success to the presence amongst his followers of an elite company of [[matchlock]]men. If this is the case, then this battle was the first time Ethiopian forces had to fight against a force armed with firearms.&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, ''Borderlands'', p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of India 1906 (Calcutta Flag).svg|thumb|220px|The Calcutta Flag]]
The '''Calcutta Flag''' was one of the first unofficial [[Flag of India|flags of India]]. It was designed by [[Sachindra Prasad Bose]] and [[Hemchandra Kanungo]] and unfurled on 7 August 1906 at Parsi Bagan Square (Grish Park), [[Calcutta]].

The flag had three horizontal bands of equal width with the top being orange, the centre yellow and the bottom green in colour. It had eight half-opened lotus flowers on the top stripe representing the eight provinces of India and a picture of the sun and a crescent moon on the bottom stripe. वन्दे मातरम् (''[[Vande Mataram]]'', meaning "I do homage to the mother") was inscribed in the center in [[Sanskrit]].

'''"Call Me"''' was the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian and Herzegovinian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]], performed in [[English Language|English]] by [[Feminnem]].

As Bosnia-Herzegovina had pre-qualified for the final, the song was performed twenty-first in the final (following [[Russia]]'s [[Natalia Podolskaya]] with [[Nobody Hurt No One]] and preceding [[Switzerland]]'s [[Vanilla Ninja]] with [[Cool Vibes]]). At the close of voting, it had received 79 points, placing 14th in a field of 24 and giving Bosnia-Herzegovina a spot to qualify through the semi-final at their next Contest.

The song is an up-tempo number, paying tribute to the Contest itself which was celebrating its 50th anniversary at the time ("50 candles on the party cake, for the many years of happiness"). The performance was likened to a radio jingle by some fans before the Contest took place.

It was succeeded as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Eurovision Song Contest|Bosnian and Herzegovinian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 Contest]] by "[[Hari Mata Hari]]" with [[Lejla (Hari Mata Hari song)|Lejla]].

'''Claudine de Culam''' (d. 1601), was a sixteen-year-old girl who was tried and hanged for the act of [[bestiality]] with a dog in [[Rognon, Doubs|Rognon]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Hastings Donnan, Fiona Magowan, ''Transgressive sex: subversion and control in erotic encounters'', 2009, pp. 95 and 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge appointed female assistants in order to put the dog and the girl to the test. As the women undressed Claudine, the dog attempted to mount her. On the basis of this evidence both the dog and the young woman were strangled to death, their bodies burned and their ashes scattered 'that as little trace as possible might remain to remind mankind of their monstrous deeds.'&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. L. Masters, ''The hidden world of erotica: forbidden sexual behaviour and morality'', 1973, pp. 16 and 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

They live around the Gabraoun oasis, at the town of [[Murzuk]], where they harvest [[brine shrimp]] in the salty lakes. They dry the brine shrimp and sell them to caravans. The name Dawada means "worm-folk" in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] due to this practice. The appearance of the Dawada is distinctive and has been likened to the [[Khoisan]], perhaps a [[relict]] population.

'''Drâa-El-Gamra''' is an archaeological site in [[Tunisia]], the site of the ancient city of '''Gor'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trismegistos.org/place/17913  Drâa-El-Gamra] at [[Tunisia]] (Africa).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Barrington Atlas'', 2000, pl. 32 E4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mapcarta.com/17292982/Map  Drâa-El-Gamra].&lt;/ref&gt; It remains a Latin Catholic [[titular see]].

== History ==
In Antiquity the location was known as Gor. It was originally a [[Punic]] city. The [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] ''[[civitas]]'', mentioned by [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]],&lt;ref&gt;By Edward White Benson, ''Cyprian: His Life, His Times, His Work'' (Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2004) p. 580&lt;/ref&gt; was located beside the [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] to [[Carthage]].

Drâa-El-Gamra was the [[cathedra|seat]] of an ancient episcopal see of the [[Roman province]] of [[Africa Proconsularis]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Antonio Morcelli, ''Africa Christiana'', Volume I, (Brescia, 1816), p.175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Mesnage, ''L'Afrique chrétienne'', (Paris, 1912), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Only two bishops are historically known. Victor took part in the council held at [[Carthage]] in 256 by [[Cyprian|Saint Cyprian]] to discuss the question of the [[Lapsi (Christianity)|''lapsi'']]. Restitutus intervened at the [[Council of Carthage (411)]].
 
Like most of the many suffragans of [[Carthage (episcopal see)|Carthage]], it faded.

== Titular see ==
Gor was nominally restored as a Latin [[titular bishopric]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pius Bonifacius Gams]], ''Series Episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae'', (Leipzig, 1931), p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flag of the Organization of American States''' is one of the official symbols of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.oas.org/legal/spanish/memoadm/MEMADM85.pdf Memorandun 85]. www.oas.org {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
==History==
It was adopted in 1965 and has been amended several times as new members have joined the OAS. The flag of the Organization of American States was used for the first time during the administration of Secretary General [[Jose Antonio Mora]]. The flag consists of the seal of the Organization, which represents the flags of all the Member States, on a royal blue background. This stamp with the flags is seen for the first time on memorandum paper in the twenties, during the General Direction of Mr. Leo S. Rowe. The flag was ordered to the company [[Annin &amp; Co.]], of New York, in April 1961. The color of the fund that was chosen was real blue that was neither light blue, nor dark blue. In the center are the flags of all the member countries placed in a circular shape, with ten masts at the bottom and framed by a circle. The design was updated for the last time in 1991 when Belize and Guyana joined the Organization of American States. Each time a new Member State enters, its flag is incorporated into the design. The use of the flag has been established in accordance with the traditions and customs in exercise throughout the years in the Organization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Vexillological description==
Its design consists of a rectangle of blue background with a white circle, bordered in gold, in its center. Inserted in this circle is the organization shell consisting of a grouping of flags of all member states, which are currently 35, hoisted in mast in gold color. The order of the flags is given in alphabetical order in the Spanish language, starting with Antigua and Barbuda in the lower left, following clockwise until Venezuela in the lower right.

'''The Global Health Delivery Project''' is a project at [[Harvard University]], United States, that aims to improve health among disadvantaged populations worldwide by studying global health delivery and delivering that knowledge to practitioners.

GHD was founded in 2007 by [[Dr. Jim Yong Kim]], [[Paul Farmer|Dr. Paul Farmer]] and Harvard Business School Professor [[Michael Porter]]. It operates with guidance from four pillars: [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Harvard School of Public Health]], [[Brigham and Women’s Hospital]] and [[Partners in Health]].

The Global Health Delivery Project shares the knowledge it generates to enable practitioners to design, implement and improve delivery programs that maximize health benefits for vulnerable communities. Closing this gap between knowledge and practice requires building a field of study in health delivery. GHD’s contribution to this research is based on principles developed by the organization’s co-founder, Michael Porter:&lt;ref&gt;Porter, ME. "What is Strategy?" Harvard Business Review. http://hbr.org/product/what-is-strategy/an/96608-PDF-ENG?Ntt=what%2520is%2520strategy&amp;referral=00269&amp;cm_sp=endeca-_-spotlight-_-link&lt;/ref&gt;

* Program case studies are primary tools for analysis and teaching.
* Field research focuses on the role of organizational leaders and their choices.
* Analytic frameworks are developed that can guide practice; frameworks are tested and refined in collaboration with practitioners delivering programs in their country.

==Projects==

===GHD case studies===
GHD develops global health case studies for the GHD curriculum and education programs, as well as contributing research tools in developing frameworks for health care delivery. GHD has developed more than 26 cases on topics, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, polio, maternal and child health, nutrition and tobacco control. The case studies follow the Harvard Business School model&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business School Learning in Practice http://www.hbs.edu/learning/case.html&lt;/ref&gt; to explore successes and failures in health care delivery.

===GHD education===
GHD offers a health care delivery course for Harvard undergraduates, and graduate courses at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health. The Global Health Effectiveness Program, piloted in 2009, consists of a 3-week session with classes in epidemiology, management science and GHD case studies. The inaugural class included 26 students and six visiting faculty from 17 countries. At Harvard Business School, the GHD curriculum has been included in health care delivery immersion and global health management courses. GHD also teamed up with the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] on its  Global Entrepreneurship Lab course.

===GHDonline===
GHDonline is an open collaboration platform developed by and for global health implementers and practitioners. GHDonline members share proven practices, connect with colleagues, and find tools to improve health outcomes in resource-limited settings.

===GHD research===
GHD research focuses on understanding and exploring solutions to the complex biological, social, economic and political problems involved in health care delivery.

GHD was part of the World Health Organization’s  Maximizing Positive Synergies Project,&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. Maximizing Positive Synergies. http://www.who.int/healthsystems/GHIsynergies/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;” that investigated the interactions between global health initiatives and health systems. In preparation for the G8 Summit in July 2009, [[Julio Frenk]], Dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, presented results from the consortium’s work to a global audience of Ministers of Health.

The '''global silver trade''' between the Americas and [[Europe]] from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries was a spillover of the [[Columbian Exchange]] which had a profound effect on the world economy. In fact, many scholars consider the [[silver]] trade to mark the beginning of a genuinely [[global economy]], with one historian noting that silver "went round the world and made the world go round."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age|last=Frank|first=Andre G.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although global, much of that silver ended up in the hands of the Chinese, as they accepted it as a form of currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Glahn|first=Richard|date=1996|title=Myth and Reality of China’s Seventeenth Century Monetary Crisis|url=|journal=Journal of Economic History|volume=2|pages=132|quote=... silver wanders throughout all the world... before flocking to China, where it remains as if at its natural center.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the global economic changes the silver trade engendered, it also put into motion a wide array of political transformations in the early modern era. "New World mines," concluded several prominent historians "supported the Spanish empire," acting as a linchpin of the Spanish economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=1995|title=Born with a 'Silver Spoon'|url=|journal=Journal of World History|volume=2|pages=210|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spaniards at the time of the [[Age of Discovery|Age of Exploration]] discovered vast amounts of silver, much of which was from the [[Potosí]] silver mines, to fuel their trade economy. Potosí's deposits were rich and Spanish American silver mines were the world's cheapest sources of it. The Spanish acquired the silver, minting it into the peso de ocho (a currency) to then use it as a means of purchase; that currency was so widespread that even the United States accepted it as valid until the [[Coinage Act of 1857]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=011/llsl011.db&amp;recNum=184|title=A Century of Lawmaking|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Spanish need for silver increased, new innovations for more efficient extraction of silver were developed, such as the amalgamation method of using [[mercury (element)|mercury]] to extract silver from ore.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In the two centuries that followed the discovery of Potosí, the Spanish silver mines in the Americas produced 40,000 tons of silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Silver, Trade, and War: Spain and America in the Making of Early Modern Europe|last=Stein|first=Stanley J.|last2=Stein|first2=Barbara H.|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, more than 150,000 tons of silver were shipped from Potosí by the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/potosi-silver-mines|title=Potosí Silver Mines|website=Atlas Obscura|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1500 to 1800, Mexico and Peru produced about 80%&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|date=1995|title=Born with a "Silver Spoon": The Origin of World Trade in 1571|url=http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/journals/jwh/jwh062p201.pdf|journal=Journal of World History|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the world's silver with 30% of it eventually ending up in China (largely because of British merchants who used it to purchase exotic Chinese commodities).  In the late 16th and early 17th century, Japan was also exporting heavily into China and the foreign trade at large.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As has been demonstrated, China dominated silver imports. The market value of silver in the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] territory was double its value elsewhere, which provided great arbitrage profit for the Europeans and Japanese.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The abundance of silver in China made it easy for the country to mint it into coinage. That process was so widespread that local Chinese government officials would demand taxes to be paid in silver to the point that silver eventually backed all of [[China's economy]].

==First paper money==
The world's first [[paper money]] ("[[flying money]]") was invented by the Chinese&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Weksel: Bill of Exchange and Promissory Note|last=Moshenskyi|first=Sergii|publisher=Xlibris|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they needed some commodity to back it. Traditional coins were useful, but the amount of coins needed for large purchases could be bulky and dangerous to transport. That problem was solved when the Chinese created small pieces of paper with pictures of the coin printed on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Money|last=Weatherford|first=Jack|publisher=Crown Business|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=125–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the nature of their geography, China had no real amount of precious metals of their own to back the paper money they invented. Because the Spaniards didn't find gold but did find copious amounts of silver, the Spaniards and the rest of Europe used this silver to purchase the commodities of choice from China, solving both of their problems.&lt;ref name="columbia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/chinawh/web/s5/s5_4.html |title=China and Europe, 1500–2000 and Beyond: What is Modern? |publisher=Afe.easia.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Silver in the Americas ==
[[File:Philip V Coin silver, 8 Reales Mexico.jpg|thumb|Silver Peso of Philip V]]
A result of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] was the discovery, production, and trade of precious metals. The Spanish, along with other European nations, had a great desire for Chinese goods such as [[silk industry in China|silk]] and [[porcelain]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giráldez|first2=Arturo|date=1995|title=Born with a "Silver Spoon": The Origin of World Trade in 1571|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078638|journal=Journal of World History|volume=6|issue=2|pages=201–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Europeans did not have any goods or commodities which China desired, so they traded silver to make up for their trade deficit.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reorient|last=Frank|first=Andre|publisher=|year=July 1998|isbn=9780520214743|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most important mining colonies of the [[Spanish Empire]] were Peru and Mexico, who were estimated to have provided one-hundred thousand tons of silver from the mid 16th Century to the end of the colonial period.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garner|first=Richard L.|date=1988|title=Long-Term Silver Mining Trends in Spanish America: A Comparative Analysis of Peru and Mexico|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1863529|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=93|issue=4|pages=898–935|doi=10.2307/1863529}}&lt;/ref&gt; The richest, and most productive mine in the Americas was that of [[Potosí]] in what is modern day Bolivia.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The richest camp in Mexico was in the city of Zacatecas, however the production of this mine was far less than that of Potosi.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Mining Processes in the Americas ===
More simplistic native mining techniques dominated American mining for the early part of the 16th Century.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brading|first=D. A.|last2=Cross|first2=Harry E.|date=1972|title=Colonial Silver Mining: Mexico and Peru|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2512781|journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=52|issue=4|pages=545–579|doi=10.2307/2512781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mining in the Americas became formally industrialized when the process of mercury amalgamation became popularized. Mercury amalgamation was invented by a Spaniard in central Mexico in the 1550s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Historians dispute what individual was the first to invent the process, however most agree that it was a Spaniard. Mercury was the one of the highest costs of production for the Americas, since much of it had to be shipped.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The ratio of Mercury to silver produced was about two to one.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, German miners introduced the [[stamp mill]] and [[lead smelting]] in the 1530s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Gunpowder was often used to blast of large holes to create the mine shafts, although there were not many deep shafts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Potosí had the most amount of ore, however it was lower quality than that of Mexico.

Mining production in the Americas largely depended on native labor in both Mexico and Peru.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In Mexico, many of the natives worked as wage laborers by the middle of the 17th Century.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48249030|title=Mexico : from the beginning to the Spanish Conquest|last=1946-|first=Knight, Alan,|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=052181474X|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=48249030}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the labor system known as the [[repartimiento]] still existed in some places.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Silver production in Mexico was relatively cheap when compared to that of Peru, and the general trend of Mexican labor systems was that towards waged labor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In Peru mines, the [[Mit'a|mit'a system]] was a dominant form of native labor subjection, although waged laborers worked on the mines as well.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Natives under the mit'a system were paid much less, and this was necessary for the production of silver to continue in Peru where costs were relatively high.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Global Flow of Silver ==
The ultimate destination for the mass amounts of silver produced in the Americas and Japan was China.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giráldez|first2=Arturo|date=2002|title=Cycles of Silver: Global Economic Unity through the Mid-Eighteenth Century|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078977|journal=Journal of World History|volume=13|issue=2|pages=391–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver from the Americas flowed mostly across the Atlantic and made its way to the far east.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A popular route was around the Cape of Good Hope into the east, and sometimes it came over land.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Major outposts for the silver trade were located in Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=1996|title=Silk for Silver: Manila-Macao Trade in the 17th Century|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42634185|journal=Philippine Studies|volume=44|issue=1|pages=52–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Manilla served as a primary outpost of the exchange of goods between the Americas, Japan, and China.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However, there is a large amount of silver that crossed across the Pacific Ocean directly from the Americas as well.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There are not many records of the amount of silver which crossed the Pacific due to it being discouraged by the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]], so estimates highly vary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Silver also found its way across other parts of the world as well. India and Europe both received a fair amount of silver.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This silver was often locally traded for other commodities, such as gold or crops. In India, silver flowed from the south to the north, and gold flowed the opposite way.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Often silver and gold were manufactured into jewelry or hoarded as treasure.

=== China and the Demand for Silver ===
China was the ultimate destination in which silver would flow towards. In exchange, the Chinese traded their popular goods such as [[silk]] and [[porcelain]]. China had a high demand for silver due to its shift from paper money to coins in the early period of the Ming Dynasty.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Glahn|first=Richard|date=1996|title=Myth and Reality of China's Seventeenth-Century Monetary Crisis|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123972|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=56|issue=2|pages=429–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ming paper currency eventually failed due to self-imposed inflation along with an inability to stop the production of counterfeit bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Shikuan|date=|title=The Sung and Ming Paper Monies: Currency Competition and Currency Bubbles|url=|journal=National Taiwan University|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ming attempted to produce copper coins as a new form of currency, but production was inconsistent.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Hence silver became of high value because it was a valid currency that could be processed abroad. The bimetallic ratio of silver to gold was about two to one, which meant that European and Japanese merchants made a large amount of profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atwell|first=William S.|date=2005|title=Another Look at Silver Imports into China, ca. 1635-1644|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20079347|journal=Journal of World History|volume=16|issue=4|pages=467–489}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1640s, the bimetallic ratios in China converged with the rest of the world, before experiencing another population boom.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The new population boom was a product of the introduction of New World crops into China, mainly sweet potatoes, which could be more easily grown.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; By this time, the silver mines in Japan were largely depleted and the New World became China's primary source for silver.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Initially, Japan served as China's primary source for silver in the 16th Century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In exchange for silver, China would provide Japan with silk and gold.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Japan and China did not directly trade with each other, due to political tensions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This meant that European entities and countries, such as the Dutch and Portuguese served as a middle man between the two countries.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== China's Silver Dominance ===
In the famed ''[[The Wealth of Nations]],'' [[Adam Smith]] noted the sheer force and great reach of the global silver trade. He was impressed by its market value but more intrigued with the way this single item of commerce brought together new and old worlds i.e. the Americas and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53006965|title=The wealth of nations|last=1723-1790.|first=Smith, Adam,|date=2003|publisher=Bantam Classic|others=Cannan, Edwin, 1861-1935.|isbn=0553585975|edition=Bantam classic|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=53006965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although China acted as the cog running the wheel of global trade, Japan's huge contribution of silver exports to China were critical to the world economy and China's liquidity and success with the commodity. Historians posit Europeans would have been left out of world trade, and China may have fallen prey to conquest by settlers of the Americas if not for Japanese silver mining. Silver was paramount to East Asia's introduction into the global trade market.&lt;ref name="Flynn 2002 391–427"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis Owen|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=2002|title=Cycles of Silver: Global Economic Unity through the Mid-Eighteenth Century|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jwh.2002.0035|journal=Journal of World History|volume=13|issue=2|pages=391–427|doi=10.1353/jwh.2002.0035|issn=1527-8050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] empires, China hoarded silver to boost its economy and increase its trading power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Southeast Asia in the Early Modern Era Trade, Power, and Belief.|last=Reid|first=Anthony J.S.|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historians argue that silver was responsible for the birth of global economics and trade. According to this view, global trade commenced in 1571 when [[Manila]] was founded and became the first trading post linking America and Asia due to the expansive and profitable silver trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=1995-01-01|title=Arbitrage, China, and World Trade in the Early Modern Period|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568520952600308|journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient|volume=38|issue=4|pages=429–448|doi=10.1163/1568520952600308|issn=0022-4995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, research shows the amount of silver traveling from Manila to China was approximately three million [[peso]]s or 94,000 kilograms in the early 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atwell, wen-t'i|first=William S., Ch'ing-shih|date=December 1977|title=Notes on Silver, Foreign Trade, and the Late Ming Economy|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/398568|journal=3|volume=|pages=1–33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rarity of silver production was seen as an opportunity for China to control the currency's value and support its own national currency. Silver was one of the only accepted trade items from Europeans and its value in China was astronomical compared to rest of the world. In fact, its value was twice that of [[Spain]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Flynn 2002 391–427"/&gt; Between 1600 and 1800 China received 100 tons of silver on average per year. A large populace near the [[Yangtze River Delta|Lower Yangzte]] averaged a hundreds of [[tael]]s of silver per household in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Huang|first=Ray|title=Financial management|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511735400.011|work=Taxation and Governmental Finance in Sixteenth-Century Ming China|pages=266–305|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511735400|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver even played a large role when defending [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s attemptive take over of Ming ruled [[Joseon|Joseon Korea]]. The Ming Ministiry of War sent approximately 140,000 liang of silver to its soldiers and required provinces to provide silver as tax for the war effort as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/843883049|title=A dragon's head and a serpent's tail : Ming China and the first great East Asian war, 1592-1598|last=Kenneth.|first=Swope,|date=2009|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806185026|location=Norman|oclc=843883049}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sixteenth century, the [[Daimyō|daimyos]] of Southwest Japan hoped for unhinged global trade but were stopped due to Ming China trade policies. Still, Japan became a player in the global economy via frequent Ming merchant ships arriving to extract Japan's abundance of silver and exchange goods. Japan increased its wealth through successful trilateral trade with [[Portugal]] and China as Japan now had Chinese goods to offer the Portuguese who had silver mines of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kobata|first=A.|date=1965|title=The Production and Uses of Gold and Silver in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Japan|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2592093|journal=The Economic History Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=245|doi=10.2307/2592093|issn=0013-0117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Founder of the Ming China dynasty, [[Hongwu Emperor|Hongwu,]] actually sought to eliminate silver from the market due to his fear of inflation which he previously experienced in the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] dynasty. His attempt involved imposing harsh limits on silver mining to stop its flow into the market and subsequently replaced it with baochao or paper money. However, the currency never popularized and silver proved its mainstay as a global currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDermott|first=Joseph P.|last2=Brook|first2=Timothy|date=1999|title=The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2672136|journal=Pacific Affairs|volume=72|issue=2|pages=267|doi=10.2307/2672136|issn=0030-851X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opium Wars==
{{Main|Opium Wars}}
Despite some restrictions, silver continued to drive trade through its popularity in Europe. This, combined with a high British demand for [[Chinese tea]], created chronic trade deficits for European governments, which were forced to risk silver deficits to supply merchants in Asia.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Immobile Empire—The first great collision of East and West—the astonishing history of Britain's grand, ill-fated expedition to open China to Western Trade, 1792–94|last=Peyrefitte|first=Alain|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As supplies of silver decreased in Europe, Europeans had less ability to purchase highly coveted Chinese goods. Merchants were no longer able to sustain the China trade through profits made by selling Chinese goods in the West and were forced to take bullion out of circulation in Europe to buy goods in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rebellions and Revolutions: China from the 1800s to 2000|last=Gray|first=Jack|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=22–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, American merchants began to introduce opium to Chinese markets. The demand for opium rose rapidly and was so profitable that Chinese opium dealers began to seek out more suppliers of the drug, thus inaugurating the opium trade; one merchant declared that Opium "is like gold. It can sell any time."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From 1804 to 1820, a period when the Qing Dynasty needed to finance the suppression of the [[White Lotus Rebellion]], Chinese merchants were soon exporting silver to pay for opium rather than Europeans paying for Chinese goods with the precious metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Voyage of the 'Frolic': New England Merchants and the Opium Trade|last=Layton|first=Thomas N.|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qing imperial court debated whether and how to end the opium trade, eventually settling on regulations on consumption. That measure, however, resulted in an increase in drug smuggling by Europeans and Chinese traders. In 1810, the Daoguang Emperor issued an edict concerning the matter, declaring, "Opium has a harm. Opium is a poison, undermining our good customs and morality. Its use is prohibited by law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Documentary Chronicle of Sino-Western relations|last=Fu|first=Lo-shu|publisher=|year=1966|isbn=|volume=1|location=|pages=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a debate at court in 1836 on whether to legalize the drug or crack down on its use, the emperor decided on the latter. An upright official, Commissioner Lin Zexu led the campaign against opium as a kind of "drug czar." The British, offended by the seizure of their property in opium, sent a large naval expedition to China to end the restrictive conditions under which they had long traded with that country. Thus began the first Opium War, in which Britain's industrialized military might was proven in China's rout. The [[Treaty of Nanking]], which ended the war in 1842 largely on British terms, imposed numerous restrictions on Chinese sovereignty and opened five ports to European traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Taking of Hong Kong: Charles and Clara Elliot in China Waters|last=Hoe|first=Susanna|last2=Roebuck|first2=Derek|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taube was first constructed in 1909-1910 by Austrian [[Igo Etrich]] and later developed into a two-seater military aircraft in 1912. Many Taubes were built under licence by a wide array of manufacturers but most were produced by the [[Rumpler Flugzeugwerke]]. By 1912 the design had evolved to a 2-seater reconnaissance aircraft for military use

Built by Rumpler as a 2-seat Taube floatplane, '''''Start''''' was the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]]'s very first [[aeroplane]], bought in [[Germany]] and arriving in [[Horten]] on 25 May 1912, at a cost of 30,000 [[Norwegian kroner]]. Funding came from private contributions after a speedy initiative from the commander and officers of the submarine [[HNoMS Kobben (1909)|HNoMS ''Kobben'']], Norway's first submarine; one of the largest contributors was H.M. King [[Haakon VII of Norway]]. 

The first flight was made on 1 June 1912&lt;ref&gt;Official Norwegian Defense Force website: [http://www.mil.no/luft/start/omlf/historikk/ History of the Royal Norwegian Air Force] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507100725/http://www.mil.no/luft/start/omlf/historikk/ |date=2006-05-07 }} {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; by ''Secondløytnant'' [[Hans Dons|Hans Fleischer Dons]] (who was also second in command on the [[submarine]] HNoMS Kobben). He took off from Gannestad in [[Borre, Norway|Borre]], flew over [[Karljohansvern naval station]] and [[Moss, Norway|Moss]] before landing in Øra, not far from [[Fredrikstad]]. The flight was 48&amp;nbsp;km long and took 35 minutes. Dons was congratulated by both the King and the [[Government of Norway|government]]. 

Start was officially given as a gift to the navy on 1 August 1912 and is today displayed at the [[Norwegian Armed Forces Aircraft Collection]].

This is a list of [[sovereign state]]s by the date in which they adopted their current [[national flag]].

For most [[sovereign state]]s, the date of flag adoption is obvious, but for others it is more contested. The exact date or year of flag adoption can be unknown or disputed because of design changes. This list defines the moment of flag adoption as the year since when the current flag had a continuous use to represent a nation, [[Autonomy|autonomous]] region or [[Military occupation|occupied]] state. Only countries that currently form a sovereign state are listed although the flag can be adopted before the countries gained [[independence]]. The listed countries may have gone through fundamental [[regime change]]s, big [[Political geography|geographical]] changes or even temporary lost [[autonomy]], joint bigger [[Political union|unions]] or [[Secession|split up]]. If the flag remained in use during such a period the original adoption date is used. Changes that do not alter the basic design of the flag; like the changes in ratio or colour shade, restyling of emblems or inscriptions or the addition or removal of stars, are listed in the last column. The current flag design often evolved over the years (e.g. the [[flag of the United States]]) or can be a re-adoption of an earlier, historic flag (e.g. the [[flag of Libya]]). The year the current flag design first came into use is listed in the middle column.

"'''Locksley Hall'''" is a poem written by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] in 1835 and published in his 1842 collection of ''[[Poems (Tennyson, 1842)|Poems]]''. It narrates the emotions of a rejected suitor come to his childhood home, the apparently fictional Locksley Hall, though in actuality Tennyson was a guest of the Arundel family in their stately home named Locksley Hall where he spent much of his time writing whilst on his visits.

According to Tennyson, the poem represents "young life, its good side, its deficiencies, and its yearnings".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Tennyson's son [[Hallam Tennyson|Hallam]] recalled that his father said the poem was inspired by Sir [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]]'s prose translation of the Arabic [[Mu'allaqat]].

==Poetic form==
[[File:Works (1895) (14576782198).jpg|thumb|Locksley Hall (illustrated)]]
"Locksley Hall" is a [[dramatic monologue]] written as a set of 97 [[rhyming]] [[couplets]]. Each line follows a modified version of [[trochaic octameter]] in which the last unstressed syllable has been eliminated; moreover, there is generally a [[caesura]], whether explicit or implicit, after the first four [[trochee]]s in the line. Each couplet is separated as its own [[stanza]]. The [[University of Toronto]] library identifies this form as "the old 'fifteener' line," quoting Tennyson, who claimed it was written in trochaics because the father of his friend [[Arthur Hallam]] suggested that the English liked the meter.&lt;ref&gt;Hill; [http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/2161.html Rpo.library.utoronto.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415174847/http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/2161.html |date=15 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The meter is reminiscent of that of the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''.

==Plot summary==
The poem opens with the unnamed protagonist asking his friends to continue ahead and leave him alone to muse about the past and the future. He reveals that the place he has stopped at is called Locksley Hall, and he spent his childhood there. The rest of the poem, though written as rhymed metered verse, follows the [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] of its [[protagonist]] as an [[interior monologue]]. The protagonist struggles to reach some sort of [[catharsis]] on his childhood feelings.

In his monologue, the protagonist begins with fond memories of his childhood sweetheart, but those memories quickly lead to a burst of anger as he relates that the object of his affections abandoned him due to her parents' disapproval. He proceeds to offer a biting criticism of her husband who supplanted him in her affections, interspersed with personal reflection. This criticism is only really interrupted when he reflects that she will eventually have a child, and will be more concerned with her child than about the protagonist. The protagonist promptly continues his angry tirade, this time directed at the mother–child relationship.

The protagonist seeks escape from his depression by thinking he might immerse himself in some sort of work that would distract him, but finds this impossible, saying:

: ''What is that which I should turn to, lighting upon days like these?''
: ''Every door is barr'd with gold, and opens but to golden keys.''
: ''Every gate is throng'd with suitors, all the markets overflow.''
: ''I have but an angry fancy; what is that which I should do?''
: ''I had been content to perish, falling on the foeman's ground,''
: ''When the ranks are roll'd in vapour, and the winds are laid with sound. '' (lines 99–104)

To be free of his depression, the protagonist continues into a grand description of the world to come, which he views as somewhat [[utopia]]n. He relapses into anger briefly again when he hears a bugle call from his comrades telling him to hurry up.

Tennyson also predicts the rise of both [[civil aviation]] and [[military aviation]] in the following words:

: ''Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,''
: ''Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales;''
: ''Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rain’d a ghastly dew''
: ''From the nations’ airy navies grappling in the central blue;''

In the 20th century, Marshal of the Royal Air Force [[Sir John Slessor]] was to use Tennyson's expression "the central blue" as the title for his autobiography.

Much of the remainder of the poem is built up of an odd contrast between the beauty of [[civilisation]] and the beauty of the [[noble savage]]. He recalls the land where he was born (which he only says is somewhere in the [[Orient]]), and lovingly notes its lack of civilisation, describing it as "Summer isles of Eden" and "knots of Paradise."

In the end, he rejects the ideal of the noble savage, preferring the progress that civilisation has made. He also immediately thereafter turns his back on Locksley Hall, and marches forth to meet his comrades.

==The main character==
Tennyson neither identifies the protagonist as a [[hero]] nor an [[anti-hero]]. The first half of the poem portrays him as a victim, but the second reveals that the protagonist holds views that are now recognised as remarkably racist and [[sexist]]; for example:

: ''Weakness to be wroth with weakness! woman’s pleasure, woman’s pain--''
: ''Nature made them blinder motions bounded in a shallower brain:''
: ''Woman is the lesser man, and all thy passions, match’d with mine,''
: ''Are as moonlight unto sunlight, and as water unto wine'' (lines 149–152)

This is contrasted however with Tennyson's known feminist views, making a lot of his similar works a satire on men of the views he wrote about.

The narrator is also remarkably emotionally volatile through the poem. A good example&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/patterson.html Victorianweb.org]&lt;/ref&gt; occurs when he reminisces about his love for his cousin Amy; while recalling the wonderful experiences of love, he immediately becomes infuriated with her, even going so far as to throw insults:

: ''Many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately ships,''
: ''And our spirits rush’d together at the touching of the lips.''
: ''O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my Amy, mine no more!''
: ''O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren shore!'' (lines 37–40)

In the narrator, Tennyson captures and displays many strong emotions—placid insightfulness, wonder, love, jealousy, despair, and eventually a sort of catharsis. Tennyson also uses the narrator to speculate on what the world might become: he presents a vision of human advance and conflict, of aerial commerce and combat, resolving in a world of federation, peace, and universal law.  As many of these predictions have since been realised, Tennyson's work now seems prescient in many ways.

==Cultural influence==
The historian [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]], writing in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]],'' quoted the poem to illustrate "a noble dream" that modern US policy decisions may have been neglecting, and he also stated that [[Winston Churchill]] considered it "the most wonderful of modern prophecies" and [[Harry S. Truman]] carried the words in his wallet.&lt;ref name=Schlesinger&gt;Schlesinger, Arthur Jr. "Bye, bye, Woodrow." ''Wall Street Journal. (Eastern edition)''. New York, N.Y.: 27 October 1993. pg. A16&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Tennyson wrote a sequel to Locksley Hall in 1886, "[[Locksley Hall Sixty Years After]]". In the sequel Tennyson describes how the industrialised nature of Britain has failed to fulfil the expectations of the poem of 1842.

A line in "Locksley Hall" would inspire the title of the historian [[Paul Kennedy]]'s 2006 book on the United Nations, ''[[The Parliament of Man]]: The Past, Present, and Future of the United Nations''.

Locksley Hall was parodied, not without beauty, to the foxhunter at least, by the Victorian English foxhunting MP William Bromley Davenport (1821–1884) in his poem "[[Lowesby Hall]]", named after a famous hunting seat in Leicestershire, the pre-eminent fox-hunting county. It describes the revived emotion in a jaded and spend-thrift city MP as he recalls the excitement of his youth foxhunting in Leicestershire, and foresees the end of his Victorian aristocratic society:

:Can I but regain my credit can I spend spent cash again
:Hide me from my deep emotion O thou wonderful champagne
:Make me feel the wild pulsation I have often felt before
:When my horse went on before me and my hack was at the door

later:&lt;br /&gt;
:Saw the landlords yield their acres after centuries of wrongs
:To the Cotton Lords to whom it's proved all property belongs
:Queen Religion State abandoned and all flags of party furled
:In the government of [[Richard Cobden|Cobden]] and the dotage of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Poems of the Chase, collected and recollected by Sir Reginald Graham, Bart. London, 1912. Lowesby Hall, by W. Bromley Davenport, pp.120–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a scene from the American film ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'', graduate student Thomas "Babe" Levy (portrayed by actor [[Dustin Hoffman]]) attends an exclusive seminar at [[Columbia University]]. During the seminar, his irritable professor, played by [[Fritz Weaver]], quotes the line "Let us hush this cry of 'Forward' till ten thousand years have gone" from "Locksley Hall Sixty Years After" and then asks if anyone recognises it. Hoffman's character is the only one who does (he writes down the title in his notes) but does not reveal this to the class. The professor calls him out on this after dismissing the other students.

In the television programme ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', the dedication plaque of the ''[[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS. Voyager]]'' quotes from the poem:
"For I dipt in to the future, far as human eye could see; Saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be."

Track two of the album [[Exit_(Tangerine_Dream_album)|Exit]] by [[electronic music]] ensemble [[Tangerine Dream]] is called "Pilots of Purple Twilight" in homage --- as discussed in the Wikipedia entry on the band, British poetry was an extramusical source of inspiration, particularly to band leader [[Edgar Froese]].

"Locksley Hall" is also the source of the title of [[Colum McCann]]'s 2009 novel, ''Let the Great World Spin''.

Also, it includes one of the most famous lines in all of English poetry, the last of the following four, albeit very few are aware of the poem whence it came, and it is often, perhaps usually, misquoted:

:In the spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast
:In the spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest
:In the spring a livelier iris changes on the burnished dove
:In the spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.

[[James Thurber]] illustrated this poem for ''[[Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated]]''.

[[Elizabeth Gaskell]] mentions the poem in her 1853 novel ''[[Cranford_(novel)|Cranford]]''. Lines from it are quoted in [[Cranford_(TV_series)|the 2007 adaptation]] of the novel.

The '''Lordship of Berat''' was a county created by [[Despot (court title)|despot]] [[Andrea II Muzaka]] of the [[Muzaka]] noble family with its capital at [[Berat]]. In 1385, during the [[Battle of Savra]], the Ottomans captured Berat from [[Balša II]], together with [[Kroje]] and [[Ulcinj]]. They soon retreated from all of thos towns keeping only Castoria under their permanent control.&lt;ref name="Pitcher1968"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pitcher|first=Donald Edgar|title=An Historical Geography of the Ottoman Empire: From Earliest Times to the End of the Sixteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gs4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA45|year=1968|publisher=Brill Archive|page=45|id=GGKEY:4CFA3RCNXRP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources explain that Ottomans probably remained in Berat with intention to use it as foothold to capture Valona.&lt;ref name="Gibbons2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibbons|first=Herbert Adam|title=The Foundation of the Ottoman Empire: A History of the Osmanlis Up To the Death of Bayezid I 1300-1403|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQiAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159|date=21 August 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-02982-1|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1396 [[Muzaka family]] took over control of Berat.&lt;ref name="FineFine1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fine|first1=John V.

The '''one hundred thousand lei''' was the largest-denomination coin ever issued in [[Romania]]. It was minted only in 1946, to mark the end of [[World War II]] the previous year.

It was made of 70% silver and 30% copper. The obverse featured a portrait of King [[Michael I of Romania]] with the inscription ''MIHAI I REGE AL ROMANIEI'' (Michael I King of the Romanians). The portrait was done by an H. Ionescu, whose name was marked below. On the reverse, a [[dove]] bearing an [[olive branch]] was pictured bringing the branch to a woman. On the bottom right of the reverse was the coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. The sculptor's name, A. Romanescu, was placed in the bottom right.

The coin had a mintage of 2.002 million from the Bucharest Mint. There are anomalies from specimen to specimen concerning the written inscription on the edge, with it starting from different points. In addition, writing can face the obverse or reverse on different coins. There are also editions without the name of A. Romanescu on its reverse. Counterfeit versions of the coin were also produced on materials of a lower value than silver and thus weigh 18.36 g instead of 25. However, the counterfeits were produced within the mint, a practice which had been frequent in Romania since the end of the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;http://romaniancoins.org/100000lei1946.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The denomination was made obsolete on 15 August 1947 after a monetary reform which redenominated 20,000 old lei to one new leu, thus giving a new value of five lei.&lt;ref&gt;http://romaniancoins.org/50bani1947.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Sandcastle''' was a United Kingdom non-combat military operation conducted between 1955–1956. Its purpose was to dispose of [[chemical weapon]]s by dumping them in the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Time bomb under the sea|first=David|last=Hencke|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=28 March 1995|pages=1, 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The British possessed almost 71,000 air-dropped bombs of 250 kilograms in weight, each of which was filled with [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]]. These had been seized from German [[ammunition dump]]s during the final months of [[World War II]]. A total of 250,000 tons of German chemical weapons had been discovered, the majority of which were destroyed because they comprised warfare agents which the allies already possessed in great abundance e.g. [[mustard gas]]. However, the stocks of [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]] and [[sarin]] were considered more valuable because the allies did not possess [[nerve agent]] technology at that time. As a result, captured stocks of German nerve agents were divided between Britain and the United States after discussion, with the Americans taking the sarin. The British transferred their 14,000 tons of ordnance containg tabun in October 1945, via [[Hamburg]] and [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], to temporary storage at the RAF strategic reserve ammunition store at [[Llanberis]]. Longer term facilities were prepared at [[RAF Llandwrog]] where the bombs were to be stored in stacks, out in the open, on the runways of the disused airfield. The intention was that any leaks of nerve agent would be dispersed by the prevailing winds. The bombs were transported to [[Llandwrog]] by truck from August 1946 to July 1947.

In July 1947 it was discovered that the bombs were [[fuze]]d and a number of them were leaking nerve agent. The fact that the bombs had fuzes inserted meant that they were inherently unsafe: to reduce the risk of accidental detonation, standard practice is to avoid installing the fuze in any air-dropped bomb until shortly before it is loaded onto an aircraft to be used in combat. For similar reasons bomb fuzes are always stored separately, well away from bombs. Unfortunately, this was not the case with the 250 kilogram tabun bombs at RAF Landwrog. Not only had the bombs been left with fuzes inserted for a considerable amount of time (possibly years), but they were also left exposed to the elements creating a corrosion risk, together with the inevitable temperature fluctuations which resulted from changing weather. None of these factors were accepted practice regarding the safe, long-term storage of bomb fuzes or explosive ordnance in general.

At a rate of 500 bombs a week they were defuzed and individually coated in a waxy preservative to seal them. Seventy-two irreparable devices were neutralised on-site by being drained into individual pits filled with [[caustic soda]] crystals. Despite being given a preservative covering the bombs continued to suffer in the damp Welsh climate and in 1951 twenty-one 'Bellman' hangars were erected on the site to store the bombs. Finally in June 1954 it was decided to dispose of the entire stock because by then it was recognised that not only did the weapons have no military value but they had actually become a liability, which could only become worse as time passed.

==Logistics==
Operation Sandcastle was divided into two sections, a sea voyage to [[Cairnryan]] and then a transfer to suitable hulks there for later sinking north-west of Ireland beyond the [[continental shelf]]. It was intended to process 16,000 bombs in the first attempt in mid-1955.

The work began with the construction of a road between Llandwrog and the nearby port of [[Fort Belan]] where six [[tank landing craft]] were assembled. Loading trials in June indicated only 400 bombs could be loaded on each craft, fewer than hoped. It was then decided to remove the tail-fins from the bombs to reduce their length, and to pack them in new boxes. This work increased each craft's load to 800 bombs and by mid-July all 16,000 devices had been safely carried to Cairnryan.

==Disposal at sea==
The {{SS|Empire Claire}} was the first scuttling ship. Its loading began in late June, and by 23 July all 16,000 bombs were aboard, although an ill-considered loading plan had given it a noticeable list to starboard. The three scuttling charges of TNT were positioned to ensure its sinking would be steady and flat, and the nine-man crew embarked. Departure was delayed by [[industrial action]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]] preventing the departure of the ocean-going [[tugboat]] ''Forester''.

On 25 July 1955 the SS ''Empire Claire'', SS ''Forester'', and navy escorts ''Mull'' and ''Sir Walter Campbell'' left Cairnryan. The ''Empire Claire'' soon broke down and was taken under tow. They reached the scuttling point ({{coord|56|30|00|N|12|00|00|W}}) in the early morning of 27 July, but waited until 10:00am for the arrival of an RAF photo-reconnaissance aircraft to observe the operation. The initial two scuttling charges blew and dramatically increased the vessel's starboard list, forcing the use of the emergency charge to open its stern and cause it to sink rapidly, bows up, to a depth of around {{convert|2500|m}}.

The later sinking went without any problems. MV ''Vogtland'' was scuttled on 30 May 1956 at the same site, taking 28,737 bombs with it, and on 21 July 1956 the SS ''Kotka'' was sunk (at {{coord|56|31|00|N|12|05|00|W}}) with 26,000 bombs, 330 tons of [[Organoarsenic chemistry|arsenial compounds]], and three tons of toxic seed dressings.

[[File:World citizen badge.svg|thumb|150px|[[World citizen]] badge]]

[[Global studies]] – interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary academic study of globalizing forces and trends. Global studies may include the investigation of one or more aspects of globalization, but tend to concentrate on how globalizing trends are redefining the relationships between states,  organizations, societies, communities, and individuals, creating new challenges that cannot be solved by nations or markets alone.&lt;ref&gt;Harth, Chris. (2005). [http://www.globalstudiesfoundation.org/downloads/gsf_research_report.pdf  'Struggling to Grasp a Moving Target: Global Studies in the US and Emergent International Landscapes.'] Interim Report Prepared for Presentation at the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Study of the factors contributing to globalization may originate in many academic concentrations, such as [[political science]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], and many others.

==History==
[[File:Colonisation2.gif|thumb|300px|Animated map showing the development of [[colonial empire]]s from 1492 to present]]

[[History of globalization]] &amp;ndash; generally broken-down into three periods: [[Archaic globalization|Archaic]], [[Proto-globalization]], and Modern.

* The [[Archaic globalization|Archaic]] period is defined as events and developments from the time of the earliest civilizations until roughly 1600.
* The period of [[Proto-globalization]] roughly spans the years between 1600 and 1800.  It was largely shaped in this era by the operations of [[colonialism]].
* The '''Modern''' period of [[globalization]] covers from the 19th century until the present time.  [[Imperialism]] and [[industrialization]] have figured largely in shaping modern globalizing forces and trends.

==Globalization concepts==

Links below are to articles, unless otherwise specified.

===Globalization-related theories===

Since globalization is not an independent phenomenon but is highly interrelated with world views, products, ideas, and other aspects of culture, '''explanations of why globalization occurs and what the effects of globalization are or can be expected''' are related to theories ranging from [[economic development]] to [[revolutionary socialism]].

== Aspects of globalization ==

===Global business organization===
{{Main|International business|International trade}}

[[International business development]] and the '''organization of business and trade worldwide''' are fundamental aspects of globalization and the development of globalizing systems.

* {{c|Global economic indicators}}'(category)

===Sociocultural globalization===
All aspects of globalization are essentially '''sociocultural''' in nature.  Here, aspects of the [[Cultural globalization|globalization of culture]] are detailed, including [[cultural diversity]], [[cultural homogenization]] and its backlash, as well as [[multiculturalism]], [[multilingualism]], [[global civics]], [[World government|world governance]] and other [[politics|political]] developments and [[social movements]] related to globalization.

===Workforce globalization===

Along with the globalization of business comes a [[New international division of labour|new spatial division of labor]], which occurs when production processes are no longer confined to national economies and [[Labour economics|labor]] becomes sourced from different parts of the globe. This '''[[global workforce]]''' has implications ranging from [[immigration policy]] to basic [[human rights|human]] and [[labor rights]].

[[File:Mall dubai.jpg|thumb|About 85% of [[Dubai]]'s population consists of migrant workers, a majority of whom are from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Migrants demand labour rights in Gulf |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7266610.stm |newspaper=BBC |date=27 February 2008 |first=Roger |last=Hardy}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Global natural environment===

The [[natural environment]] can be contrasted with the [[built environment]], comprising the areas and components that are strongly influenced by humans. In the age of globalization, few ''absolutely natural'' environments remain. [[Human ecology|Human challenges]] to the natural environment, such as [[climate change]], cross-boundary water and air [[pollution]], [[over-fishing]] of the ocean, and the spread of [[invasive species]] require at least transnational and, often, global solutions.

'''Realising Freedom's Capability''', also known as '''Uwezo''' (''Leadership''), was a political party in the [[Comoros]].

==History==
The party was established in [[Paris]] by former Foreign Minister [[Abdallah Mouazoir]] in 1984 as the '''Union for a Democratic Republic in the Comoros''' (''Union pour une République Démocratique aux Comores'', URDC).&lt;ref name=HD&gt;Martin Ottenheimer &amp; Harriet Ottenheimer (1994) ''Historical Dictionary of the Comoro Islands'', Scarecrow Press, p86&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 it was reorganised as UWEZO.&lt;ref name=HD/&gt; The party was part of the "no" camp for the [[Comorian constitutional referendum, 1992|1992 constitutional referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:WR8Skg6uIBMJ:www.africaintelligence.fr/ION/politics/1992/05/30/referendum-eve-confusion,15160-ART+&amp;cd=4&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk Comoros Islands: Referendum-eve confusion] African Intelligence, 30 May 1992&lt;/ref&gt; It won a single seat in the [[Comorian legislative election, 1992|1992 elections]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africaintelligence.com/ION/politics/1992/12/26/unlucky-for-some%2C17969-ART?CXT=CANP&amp;country=COMOROS%20ISLANDS Comoros Islands: Unlucky for some] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130041209/https://www.africaintelligence.com/ION/politics/1992/12/26/unlucky-for-some%2C17969-ART?CXT=CANP&amp;country=COMOROS%20ISLANDS |date=2016-11-30 }} African Intelligence, 26 December 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and retained it in [[Comorian legislative election, 1993|early elections]] the following year.

The party nominated Mouazoir as its candidate for the [[Comorian presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential elections]]. Abdallah failed to make the second round.

The '''SS state of Burgundy''' (in [[German language|German]]: «SS-Staat Burgund») or '''Order-State of Burgundy''' (in [[German language|German]]: «Ordensstaat Burgund», a historical reference to the [[State of the Teutonic Order]]) was a proposed state which the leadership of [[Nazi Germany]] hoped to create in certain areas of [[Western Europe]] during World War II.

==History==
The name "[[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]" itself (derived from the [[Burgundians]], an ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]]) is a vague term, geographically speaking. A wide number of different countries and regions throughout history have been referred to by this name or controlled by a Burgundy-based state.

The most outspoken proponent of re-creating a German-controlled Burgundian state was [[Heinrich Himmler]], leader of the [[SS]]. According to Himmler, Burgundy, which he called "an ancient economic and cultural centre", had been "reduced to nothing more than a French appendage, known only for its [[Burgundy wine|wine production]]". This plan entailed the transformation of Burgundy into a model-state nominally located outside of the [[Greater Germanic Reich|Greater German Reich]], but nevertheless ruled by a [[National Socialist]] government, and which would also have its own army, laws, and postal services. It was supposed to encompass [[French Swiss|French Switzerland]] ([[Romandy]]), [[Picardy]] with [[Amiens]], the [[Champagne (province)|Champagne district]] with [[Reims]] and [[Troyes]], the [[Franche-Comté]] with [[Dijon]], [[Chalon-sur-Saône|Chalons]], and [[Nevers]], [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] and [[Luxembourg (Belgium)]]. It was also to have a [[Transport corridor|connection]] to both the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as well as the [[English Channel]]. The capital and administrative seat was tentatively proposed as either [[Dijon]] or [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] (''Nanzig'') as its capital.&lt;ref&gt;''Books: If Hitler Had Won''. [[Time Magazine]], Monday, Mar. 24, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; Its official language was to become [[German language|German]], but would initially be also [[French language|French]].

Whether these were merely the dreams of Himmler personally or, as he so claimed, enjoyed [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]’s full support is inconclusive from the historical record. Hitler's own objective towards France was to eliminate it permanently as a strategic threat to German security. The [[Battle of France|1940 campaign]] in [[Western Europe]] was in fact carried out entirely so that its western flank could be secured before Germany would commit its armies to conquering ''[[Lebensraum]]'' in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman Rich (1973). ''Hitler's War Aims: Ideology, the Nazi State, and the Course of Expansion''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, New York. p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; With this in mind, extensive plans were made so that France could be reduced to a minor state and a permanent German [[Vassal state|vassal]] kept firmly in the state of dependence that she had found herself in after the [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|1940 armistice]] and which it would thus have no further reason to fear.

At Hitler’s request a plan was produced after the [[fall of France]] in 1940 that would provide for the outright [[annexation]] into Germany of a large strip of Eastern France by reducing it to its late medieval borders with the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. This memo, produced by the [[Reich Interior Ministry]] forms the basis for the so-called ''northeast line'' which separated the 'forbidden zone' of [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupied France]] from the rest of the areas under military control.&lt;ref&gt;Schöttler, Peter (2003). "'Eine Art „Generalplan West“: Die Stuckart-Denkschrift vom 14. Juni 1940 und die Planungen für eine neue deutsch-französische Grenze im Zweiten Weltkrieg." (in ger). Sozial.Geschichte 18 (3): 83–131.&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed the [[Forced resettlement|deportation]] of its [[French people|French]] inhabitants and the settlement of a million German peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, Heinrich August; Sager, Alexander (2007). ''Germany: The Long Road West. 1933-1990''. [[Oxford University Press]]. p. 74. {{ISBN|0199265984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered these areas, as well as [[Wallonia]] to be "in reality German" and should therefore be re-integrated.&lt;ref&gt;John Frank Williams (2005).'' Corporal Hitler and the Great War 1914-1918: the List Regiment''. Frank Cass, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942 Hitler did mention that the former area of the [[Kingdom of Burgundy]], which France "had taken from Germany in her weakest moment" would also have to be annexed to Nazi Germany ''after'' the incorporation of the forbidden zone, but to which areas he referred by this statement remains unclear.&lt;ref name="Rich"&gt;Norman Rich (1974). ''Hitler's War Aims: the Establishment of the New Order''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company Inc, New York. p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brittany State==
There were also proposals for an [[Breton nationalism and World War II|independent Brittany]] state.&lt;ref name="Rich"/&gt; Hitler himself mentioned this intention on at least one occasion to his military leaders,&lt;ref&gt;Janusz Gumkowski and Kazimierz Leszczynski. ''Hitler's Plans for Eastern Europe''. Selections from ''Poland under Nazi Occupation''. Retrieved 5 November 2010 [https://archive.is/20120527021449/http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; but ultimately seemed to have taken little interest in the project.&lt;ref name="Rich"/&gt;

'''Thales Optronics''' is a [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[optronics]] manufacturer and a [[Division (business)|division]] of [[Thales Group]]. It has three main subsidiaries: the United Kingdom-based Thales Optronics Limited, the France-based Thales Optronique SA and the Netherlands-based Thales Optronics B.V.

==History==
Thales' optronics businesses in the UK trace their origins to Pilkington Optronics, which was formed by [[Pilkington]] plc in 1988 to take control of the company's optronics businesses: Pilkington PE located in North Wales(formed in 1966) and [[Barr and Stroud]], which was based in [[Glasgow]]. Pilkington PE later became Thales Optics Ltd., which was divested from Thales in December 2005 as Qioptiq Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Rolston Gordon Communications | year = 2005 | month = | title =Dates for the Diary | journal = Microscopy and analysis| volume = | issue =80-81  | pages =1988 | id = | doi = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TptVAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Qioptiq+thales&amp;dq=Qioptiq+thales&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7kPWMsOP59&amp;sig=RojquO52xbxwpQ6cTjXuFFkN4WU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vz49UNK3Noel0AXGzoGQCg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Thomson-CSF acquired 50% of Pilkington Optronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Directory of multinationals - Volume 2|first1=John|last1=Stopford|publisher=Macmillan|year=1992|isbn=9781561590537|page=1345|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=29wbAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Pilkington+Thorn+Optronics&amp;dq=Pilkington+Thorn+Optronics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gOTEUkY2fx&amp;sig=R7HcA-aOJebkZlE_ZoNkGUJfvj4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JTY9ULXkN-eU0QW9_YHYBQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAjgU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Pilkington Optronics acquired [[Thorn EMI]] Electro Optics which was renamed Pilkington Thorn Optronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Royal Aeronautical Society | year = 1995 | month = | title = Who's Growing | journal = Aerospace| volume = 22 | issue =  | pages =51 | id = | doi = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=S01KAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Pilkington+Thorn+Optronics&amp;dq=Pilkington+Thorn+Optronics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=44cUz-sizI&amp;sig=9Z2Ozh0bkY0d8GwKhkg5S8h0SvM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NTg9UOqUOsLX0QXK6YGQDQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Thomson-CSF purchased another 40% of Pilkington Optronics from Pilkington and the remainder in 2000 to make it a wholly owned subsidiary. In 2000 Thomson-CSF was renamed Thales and Pilkington Optronics Ltd. became Thales Optronics Ltd.  Soon after, Thomson-CSF acquired [[W Vinten Ltd]], a British reconnaissance equipment manufacturer, including the [[Joint Reconnaissance Pod]], who now operate as Thales Optronics (Bury St Edmunds) Ltd.

In November 2006 Thales Optronics Limited announced the closure of its manufacturing facility in Taunton, Somerset, with the loss of 180 jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/6133272.stm|title=Defence jobs to be cut from depot |accessdate=28 August 2012|publisher=BBC News| date=9 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007 Thales sold the beryllium mirrors and structures business of Thales Optronics Limited to GSI Group Inc. for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/06/04/thalesoptronics-takeover-gsi-idUKWNAS308320070604|title=GSI Group buys Thales Optronics beryllium business|accessdate=28 August 2012|publisher=Reuters| date=4 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thales Optronics Limited was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/news-editors-picks/glasgow-defence-firm-earns-royal-approval.14236923|title=Thales Glasgow defence firm earns royal approval|accessdate=28 August 2012|publisher=Evening Times| date=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1149">'''Vrmac Tunnel''' ({{lang-cnr|Тунел Врмац}}) is a vehicular tunnel in southern [[Montenegro]].

[[File:Vrmac.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the tunnel]]

The tunnel, which is 1,637 m long, connects town of [[Kotor]] with the [[Adriatic Motorway]] and the rest of Montenegro. It passes under [[Vrmac|Mount Vrmac]], thus eliminating the journey along the old curvy road that passes over the mountain.

The tunnel was half-finished in 1991, but was then opened to the public as it was, because of the lack of funding to finish it. In 2004 work began to finish the tunnel, and to bring it up to European standards. The construction works, undertaken by [[Austria]]n company [[Strabag]], were finished early in 2007, and the tunnel is now equipped with up-to-date lighting, ventilation and security systems.

'''Šavnik''' ([[Montenegrin Cyrillic|Montenegrin]] Cyrillic: Шавник, {{IPA-sh|ʃǎv̞niːk|pron}}) is a town in [[Montenegro]] and administrative center of the [[Šavnik Municipality]]. It is located at the confluence of three rivers - [[Bukovica (river)|Bukovica]], Bijela and [[Šavnik (river)|Šavnik]], at an altitude of 840 meters. It is the lowest lying settlement in the municipality.

==History==
Unlike most settlements in the area, which date back several centuries, Šavnik is relatively new, founded only in 1861. It was populated by migrants from other parts of [[Montenegro]] and [[Old Herzegovina|Herzegovina]], mostly craftsmen, merchants, riflers and blacksmiths, which were needed by local farmers. The area was overgrown with [[Willow|willows]], which the newly formed town was named after (šavice – willow branches or seams, which were used as a roof covering).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://portalanalitika.me/clanak/264880/nepokretna-bastina-crne-gore-savnik|title=Nepokretna baština Crne Gore - ŠAVNIK|work=https://portalanalitika.me|access-date=2018-11-07|language=bs-Latn}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before the construction of first houses on the site of today's town, there were two mills on [[Šavnik (river)|Šavnik River]]. The first three houses that were built in Šavnik were a tavern with a shop, rifle repair shop and a blacksmith shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.savnik.me/index.php?page=istorija|title=Opština Šavnik {{!}} Istorija|website=www.savnik.me|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town quickly became a center for the [[Drobnjaci]] region, and incorporated a post office, school, primary court, and military post.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ekozona.wordpress.com/savnik/|title=Savnik|date=2011-02-26|work=Eko zona Durmitor|access-date=2018-11-07|language=sr-RS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrialization during the [[SFR Yugoslavia]] era mostly bypassed Šavnik, so did all major transit road or rail links, and economy of town went into stagnation. Population of Šavnik and entire municipality is since in slow but steady decline. Most of the residents are migrating to [[Nikšić]] and southern Montenegro, and Šavnik is often a synonym for a poor and deteriorating town.

The [[M-6 highway (Montenegro)|new road]] [[Risan]] - Nikšić - Šavnik - [[Žabljak]] (P5), and proximity of Žabljak as a main mountain tourist resort in Montenegro may boost Šavnik's economic prospects.

==Transport==

Šavnik is situated on a regional road halfway between [[Nikšić]] and [[Žabljak]], and it is its only link with the rest of Montenegro.

==Population==
Šavnik is administrative centre of Šavnik municipality, which in 2011 had a population of 2,070. The town of Šavnik itself has 472 citizens.
