'''Alexander Bengt Magnus Bard''' (born 17 March 1961) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] songwriter, record producer, TV personality, religious and political activist, and one of two founders of [[Syntheism|Syntheistic religious movement]] alongside with [[Jan Söderqvist]].

==Background and education==
Bard was born in [[Medevi]], [[Motala Municipality]], [[Sweden]] on 17 March 1961. After he completed his upper secondary education, Bard studied in the United States and in [[Amsterdam]], Netherlands. While living in Amsterdam, he earned part of his living as a [[sex worker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Fredrik |last=Strage |authorlink=Fredrik Strage |title=Åsiktsmaskinen Alexander Bard |url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=2198&amp;a=525795&amp;previousRenderType=6 |publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |date=3 March 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-22 |language=Swedish|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426083719/http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=2198&amp;a=525795&amp;previousRenderType=6|archivedate=26 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bard returned to Sweden to study at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] from 1984 to 1989. In addition to his studies in economics, he took a strong interest in philosophy and [[social theory]] with the explicit aim of becoming a philosophy writer and lecturer. Bard has been a judge on [[Idol (Swedish TV series)|''Swedish Idol'']], a spin-off of ''[[Pop Idol]]'', since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWHktVPbH5s YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and lecturing==
Bard has written three books on the Internet revolution, collectively known as ''The Futurica Trilogy'', together with media theorist [[Jan Söderqvist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stockholmtext.com/titles/the-futurica-trilogy/ |title=The Futurica Trilogy |publisher=Stockholm Text |date=28 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first collaboration ''The Netocrats'' was originally released in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] in 2000, became available in English in 2003, and has since been translated to a further 16 languages with total worldwide sales exceeding 340,000 copies.

The second book ''The Global Empire'' was originally released in Swedish in 2003, while the third installment of the trilogy ''The Body Machines'' was originally published in Swedish in 2009. These latter two works were released in English in 2012, completing ''The Futurica Trilogy'', in which the authors present their philosophical vision for a [[global society|global]] and increasingly [[Virtuality (philosophy)|virtual society]], as a consequence of [[Interactivity|the Internet revolution]]. A fourth book from Bard &amp; Söderqvist, ''Syntheism - Creating God in The Internet Age'', was released in October 2014. The book focuses on [[participatory culture]] as the spirituality of the digital age and advocates a [[relationalism]] inspired by philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and physicist [[Niels Bohr]] as the antidote to the [[individualism]] of the collapsing capitalist age.

Bard has given public lectures since 1997, including three TEDx presentations (as of 2013), with a major focus on the social implications of the [[Internet|Internet revolution]] and has become one of the leading speakers on the international [[Management science|management theory]] lecturing circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speakersnet.se |title=Speakersnet – exclusive speakers – Speakersnet |publisher=Speakersnet.se |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical career ==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2014}}
Bard began his musical career in 1982 with the single ''Life in a Goldfish Bowl'' released under the name Baard, a synth-punk fusion project he had formed together with two female striptease dancers. He later had some minor success as Barbie, which saw Bard performing ironic [[bubblegum pop]] songs [[Crossdressing|crossdressed]].

After abandoning work on a second Barbie album, Bard formed [[Army of Lovers]] with two of Barbie's entourage, [[Jean-Pierre Barda]] and [[Camilla Henemark|La Camilla]]. Army of Lovers had over 20 pan-European hits, the biggest being [[Crucified (Army of Lovers song)|''Crucified'']], ''Obsession'', and ''Sexual Revolution'', while their presence in the US and the UK was limited to repeated club chart successes. They released five studio albums, made over 20 music videos, and became phenomenally successful across Eastern Europe, before Bard disbanded the group in 1996. Army of Lovers have later earned a widespread iconic status in the gay culture, often referred to as a perfect example of the postmodern take on the ideals of [[camp (style)|camp]]. Alexander Bard also worked on the production &amp; composition of Swedish girlgroup [[Midi, Maxi &amp; Efti]].

Following the demise of Army of Lovers, Bard founded [[Vacuum (band)|Vacuum]], a symphonic [[synthpop]] project featuring Bard, [[Marina Schiptjenko]] (formerly of synthpop group Page), and newcomer [[Mattias Lindblom]]. Their debut single ''I Breathe'' was one of the fastest selling singles in [[Sweden]] in 1997 and also topped the singles chart in Italy. Further releases did not do as well, except in Russia and [[Ukraine]], and Bard left after only two albums. He reformed Army of Lovers briefly in 2000 for a handful of new tracks and a greatest hits collection, and later co-wrote and co-produced the first two [[Alcazar (band)|Alcazar]] albums.

In 2005, Bard launched a new music project called [[Bodies Without Organs|BWO]] (short for Bodies Without Organs), together with Marina Schiptjenko and new vocalist [[Martin Rolinski]]. Their debut album ''Prototype'' generated seven top 20 hit singles in Scandinavia and across Eastern Europe and reached platinum status. A second album ''Halcyon Days'', was released in April 2006, which shipped gold and generated four additional hit singles. 2007 saw the release of a third album, ''Fabricator'', followed by a 2008 compilation album and the 2009 release of a fourth studio album, ''Big Science''.

In April 2010, Bard announced that he was working with co-producer [[Henrik Wikström]] on a new project called [[Gravitonas]], signed to [[Universal Music]] worldwide. The project, described as electro-rock, and fronted by Bard himself and vocalist [[Andreas Öhrn]], released a first digital EP in May 2010 and had its first charts hits in Sweden and Russia in the autumn of 2010. Since they refuse to release physical records tied to traditional promotional media campaigns and instead strictly release their music through streaming and downloads and in EP rather than album format, Gravitonas have been dubbed "The World's First [[Spotify]] Band" by bloggers and the music press. Bard's public friendship with Spotify founder [[Daniel Ek]] has played into this narrative. In addition to several No. 1 hit records across the European continent, Gravitonas have also achieved a considerable following as dance act in the U.S., with three hit records to date in the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Top 50 Club Play Chart.

Besides the groups mentioned above, Alexander Bard has also worked as a songwriter and producer for several Swedish artists, in the 1980s mainly with [[Ola Håkansson]] and [[Tim Norell]], in the early 1990s with [[Anders Wollbeck]] and [[Per Adebratt]]—especially on the early 1990s [[Columbia Records]]—signed African cult act [[Midi Maxi &amp; Efti]]—and more recently mainly with [[Anders Hansson (songwriter)|Anders Hansson]] and Henrik Wikström.

Bard was a co-founder of [[Stockholm Records]] and runs several internet and music-related businesses. In August 2011, Bard joined the jury of the Swedish version of the [[Idol (Sweden)|Idol TV show]], sharing the stage with [[Celine Dion]]'s record producer [[Anders Bagge]], quickly being referred to as ''The Scandinavian Simon Cowell'' due to his famously and characteristically harsh and straightforward commenting of the contestants.

[[Army of Lovers]] reunited in 2013, releasing a new compilation album titled ''Big Battle of Egos'' featuring four brand new tracks including lead single and video ''Signed on My Tattoo'', a duet with [[Gravitonas]]. The band cited political reasons, including their outspoken opposition to increased [[homophobia]] and [[antisemitism]] in Europe, for the reunification, after which they headlined both the [[Gay pride|Pride]] festivities of 2013 in [[Copenhagen]] and [[Belgrade]] and several major TV shows in [[Sweden]], [[Poland]], Russia and [[Ukraine]].

He is one of the jury in [[Talang 2017]] which is broadcast on [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]].

== Politics ==

Alexander Bard has for long been a vocal opponent of laws against personal drug consumption and laws against [[Prostitution in Sweden|prostitution in Sweden]]. Having earlier been a member of — or worked closely with members of — [[The Liberals (Sweden)|The Liberals]], [[Centerpartiet|the Center party]] and the [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]], he joined the newly founded [[Citizens' Coalition]] in 2018. He considers himself to be a [[Libertarian Marxism|Libertarian Marxist]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/bardissimo/status/944831547126853637?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.trendingtopics.at/digital-libido-alexander-bard-interview-alpbach/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[demonology]], '''Amaymon''' (also '''Amaimon''', or '''Amoymon''') is a [[Prince]] of [[Hell]], and, according to some [[Grimoire]]s, the only one who has power over [[Asmodai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Goetia: The Lesser Key of Solomon the King|author1=Aleister Crowley |author2=Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers |author3=Hymenaeus Beta |year=1995|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5XtJ_Go8euwC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Amaymon&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html|publisher=Red Wheel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A curious characteristic of this Spirit is shown during the Evocation of Asmodai to visible appearance, when the [[Exorcist]] must stand upright with his Cap or Headdress removed in a show of respect; for if he does not it is Amaymon who will deceive him and doom all his work.

Amaymon is said to have a deadly poisonous breath.

''[[The Lesser Key of Solomon]]'' states the Exorcist or conjurer must be in possession of a Silver Ring, duly consecrated and worn on the middle finger as a form of protection against this poisonous astral breath.

According to [[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]] he is the King of the West, although for some translations of ''The Lesser Key of Solomon'' he is King of the East (Although some translations of ''The Lesser Key of Solomon'' consider [[Belial]], [[Beleth]], [[Asmodai]] and [[Gaap]] kings of the four cardinal directions, though not giving detail on the cardinal point each rule).

According to the [[grimoire]] ''[[The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage]]'' translated by [[S.L. MacGregor Mathers]], Amaymon (as Amaimon) was one of the eight Sub-Princes, described as an Egyptian devil whom Abramelin restrained from working evil from the third hour till noon and from the ninth till evening.

In 2014, Keegan founded Full Circle, a community spiritual center based out of [[Venice Beach]], California.&lt;ref name="vulture1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lauren Bans |url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/andrew-keegan-encounter.html |title=Om-ing by the Beach With Andrew Keegan |publisher=Vulture |date= |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' characterized the organization as a "new religion",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mv55wa/andrew-keegan-started-a-new-religion-814|title=One of the Stars of '10 Things I Hate About You' Started a Religion|last=Dodge|first=Shyam|date=2014-08-14|work=Vice|access-date=2018-05-16|last2=Wakefield|first2=Shanrah|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other outlets called it a cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jezebel.com/andrew-keegan-cult-leader-today-im-here-to-activate-1690269134|title=Andrew Keegan, Cult Leader: 'Today, I'm Here to Activate High Vibes'|last=Shechet|first=Ellie|work=Jezebel|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Keegan described the group as a "non-denominational spiritual community center where people of all beliefs and backgrounds come together to meditate, practice yoga, and engage artistically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.allaccess.com/qa-with-actor-and-co-founder-of-full-circle-venice-andrew-keegan-talks-bringing-music-spirituality-and-love-to-the-community/ |title=Q&amp;A with Actor and Co-Founder of Full Circle Venice, ANDREW KEEGAN – Talks Bringing Music, Spirituality and Love to the community.|publisher=Music.AllAccess.com |date=2015-01-22 |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' reported in March 2015 that "the actual theology of the group is tough to pin down, but it seems to loosely follow Hinduism—or at least Russell Brand's Sanskrit-tattoo version of it."&lt;ref name="vulture1" /&gt; In May 2015, the Full Circle temple was raided by Californian Alcohol Beverage Control officers.&lt;ref name="Kombucha"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearl|first1=Mike|title=The Guy From '10 Things I Hate About You' Who Started a Religion Had His Temple Raided for Kombucha|url=https://www.vice.com/read/law-enforcement-raided-andrew-keegans-temple-in-los-angeles-for-kombucha|website=Vice|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raid was apparently related to Full Circle's distribution of [[kombucha]], a fermented beverage made from sweet black tea.&lt;ref name="Kombucha" /&gt; A spokesperson for the temple stated that they were unaware that they needed a license to distribute kombucha.&lt;ref name="Kombucha" /&gt; The organization closed its doors in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/fullcirclevenice/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2018}}

==Career==
He was first recognized for his performance of teen rebel Zack Dell in the film ''[[Camp Nowhere]]'' (1994). Keegan was cast in a minor role in the 1996 film ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]''. He also played a love interest for Stephanie Tanner in the television series ''[[Full House]]'' for an episode. He had guest parts on numerous television shows before being cast on the TV drama ''Party of Five'' (1994). That same year, he landed another recurring role on ''7th Heaven'' (1996), where he played a single teenaged father in love with [[Jessica Biel|Jessica Biel's]] character Mary. Keegan was then cast in two modern-day Shakespearean film adaptations: as the antagonist of Heath Ledger in the 1999 comedy ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]'' (adapted from ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'') and as [[Mekhi Phifer|Mekhi Phifer's]] best friend in 2001's ''[[O (film)|O]]'', adapted from ''[[Othello]]''.

Keegan then took a role in Greg Berlanti's ''[[The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy]]'' (2000), which won Best Picture that year at the [[GLAAD Awards]]. In 2009, Keegan made his theatrical stage debut in the play ''He Asked For It'', playing Rigby, a character tackling the emotional issues of being HIV-positive in modern-day society. In 2010, Keegan played Strayger, a drug-smuggling pilot in the 2010 action film ''Kill Speed''.  Keegan took on a role as a sadistic and sociopathic vampire named Blake in the film ''Living Among Us'' (2015).

'''Ariobarzanes''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]] Ἀριoβαρζάνης), ([[Old Persian]]: Ariyabrdhna, ''Ariyaubrdhna'') ''Ariobarzan'' or spelled as '''Ario Barzan''' or '''Aryo Barzan''', perhaps signifying "''exalting the Aryans''" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Dandamayev |first=M. A. |author2=A. Sh. Shahbazi|author3=P. Lecoq | title=Ariobarzanes | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica | accessdate=9 May 2013|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ariobarzanes-greek-form-of-old-iranian-proper-name-arya-brzana}}&lt;/ref&gt; (death: crucified in c. 362 BCE), sometimes known as Ariobarzanes I of Cius, was a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] [[Satrap]] of [[Phrygia]] and military commander, leader of an independence revolt, and the first known of the line of rulers of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] town of [[Cius]] from which were eventually to stem the kings of [[List of Kings of Pontus|Pontus]] in the 3rd century BCE.
Ariobarzanes was apparently a cadet member of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaimenid]] dynasty, specifically its branch which had settled to hold [[Dascylium]] of Hellespont in the 470s BCE. Cius is located near Dascylium, and Cius seemingly was a share of family holdings for the branch of Ariobarzanes.

Ariobarzanes' one predecessor was a (kinsman) named Mithradates (possibly [[Mithradates, Satrap of Cappadocia]]). The archaeologist [[Walther Judeich]] claims that Ariobarzanes was that Mithradates' son, but [[Brian C. McGing]] refutes that specific filiation. Seemingly, no classical source itself calls them son and father, the filiation being a later reconstruction on basis of successorship.

[[Pharnabazus (5th century BC)|Pharnabazus]], Satrap of Phrygia ([[floruit|fl.]] 413{{snd}}373 BCE), son of [[Pharnaces of Phrygia]], is indicated to have shared his rule and territories with his brothers in the late 5th century BCE when Pharnabazos had recently succeeded to the position. Mithradates, Satrap of Cappadocia, might have been one of such brothers. Ariobarzanes of Cius might have also been one of those brothers.

The classical source [[Appian]]us relates that Ariobarzanes was of a cadet line of the family of the Persian Great King [[Darius I|Dareios (Darius the Great)]].

It is highly probable he is the same Ariobarzanes who, around 407 BCE, was the Persian envoy to the Greek city-states and cultivated the friendship of [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]]. 
Ariobarzanes conducted the [[Athens|Athenian]] ambassadors, in 405 BCE, to his sea-town of Cius in [[Mysia]], after they had been detained three years by order of [[Cyrus the Younger]].{{r|xen2_1.4.7}}

Ariobarzanes was mentioned as under-satrap in Anatolia in late 5th century BCE. He then apparently succeeded his presumed kinsman (possibly elder brother)  [[Pharnabazus (5th century BC)|Pharnabazus]] (fl. 413{{snd}}373 BCE) as satrap of Phrygia and Lydia, assigned by Pharnabazos himself when he departed to the Persian court to marry Apama, daughter of the Persian king. Thus Ariobarzanes became the satrap of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]], in what is now the northwest of Turkey. Pharnabazos lived well into the 370s BCE, having obtained higher positions in the Persian monarchy than merely the Phrygian satrapship.

Ariobarzanes assisted [[Antalcidas]] in 388 BCE.{{r|xen2_5.1.28}} He appears to have still held some high office in the Persian court in 368 BCE, as we find him, apparently on behalf of the king, sending an embassy to [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] in that year.{{r|xen_7.1.27}} Ariobarzanes, who is called by [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]]{{r|diod_15.90}} [[satrap]] of [[Phrygia]], and by [[Cornelius Nepos|Nepos]]{{r|nepos_2}} satrap of [[Lydia]], [[Ionia]], and Phrygia, revolted against [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] in 362. [[Demosthenes]] speaks of Ariobarzanes and his three sons having been lately made [[Athens|Athenian]] citizens.{{r|dem1}} He mentions him again{{r|dem2}} in the following year and says, that the Athenians had sent [[Timotheus (general)|Timotheus]] to his assistance; but that when the Athenian general saw that Ariobarzanes was in open revolt against the king, he refused to assist him.

When Pharnabazos' son, [[Artabazos II of Phrygia]], wanted to regain his father's satrapy from their kinsman, Ariobarzanes refused. Ultimately, in about 366 BCE, Ariobarzanes joined an unsuccessful revolt of the satraps of western [[Anatolia]] against the Achamenian King [[Artaxerxes II]] ([[Revolt of the Satraps]]).  Several other satraps sided with Ariobarzanes, including [[Mausolus]] of [[Caria]] (briefly), [[Orontes I]] of [[Armenia]], [[Autophradates]] of [[Lydia]] and [[Datames]] of [[Cappadocia]]. The rebel satraps also received support from the pharaoh of Egypt, [[Teos]], as well as from some of the Greek city states, with the Spartan king [[Agesilaus II]] coming to their assistance with a mercenary force.  As signal of sympathy in the effort, Athens made Ariobarzanes and three of his sons citizens of Athens. Ariobarzanes was betrayed by his son [[Mithridates I of Cius|Mithridates]] to his overlord, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] king,{{r|xen1_8.8.4_aris_5.8.15}} who had Ariobarzanes crucified.

'''Arthur Paunzen''' (4 February 1890 &amp;ndash; 9 August 1940?) was a [[Jewish]] [[Austria]]n artist.

==Biography==

Paunzen was born on 4 February in [[fin de siecle]], [[Vienna]], to Leopold Paunzen and Hermine née Kuhn. His parents were [[Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;Vienna index of Jewish records&lt;/ref&gt; He studied with [[Ludwig Koch (painter)|Ludwig Koch]] in Vienna. He also studied in [[France]] at [[Académie Julian]] under [[Jean Pierre Laurens]] and traveled [[Italy]] studying art and architecture, which was very common for his time. In 1918 Paunzen married the [[Jewish]] Cornelia Westreich in Vienna.
Paunzen created a number of works that make bold symbolic attempts to convey music as images. For instance, depicting [[Beethoven]]’s [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]] (Third) Symphony as nude horse backed trumpeters in the sky surrounded by clouds, flanked by a "stony faced" trumpeter who might very well be death. Also, his series based on [[Gustav Mahler]]'s song cycle, the "[[Song of the Earth]]" or the etchings he created for [[Raskolnikov]].

Many of his pieces were collected by the [[British Museum]], the [[Stockholm Engraving Collection]] and the [[Albertina Museum]] in Vienna.

In 1938, as [[Hitler]] rose to power, Paunzen moved to [[Great Britain]].

==Later life and death==

Arthur Paunzen died on 9 August 1940, in [[Central Internment Camp]], Douglas, Isle of Man. (In a panic measure, the British authorities interned all [[German people|German]] and [[Austrian people|Austrian]] citizens in the country, including all those who were Jews fleeing Nazi oppression, in May 1940.) His death is described by his friend and fellow-internee, the composer [[Hans Gál]], in his internment diary.&lt;ref&gt;'Musik hinter Stacheldraht', Peter Lang, Bern, 2003, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; He died of severe [[bronchial pneumonia]], exacerbated, according to Gál's account, by neglect on the part of the authorities. He is buried in the Jewish section of Douglas Borough Cemetery, Isle of Man &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishgen.org/JCR-uk/community/Iom/Isle_of_Man_Cemetery.htm&lt;/ref&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2258">The '''auguraculum''' (plural: auguracula), was a roofless temple oriented to the cardinal points, in which the priests of ancient Rome practiced [[augury]] and [[ornithomancy]].&lt;ref&gt;Platner, Samuel Ball. A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome. London: Oxford UP, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The priest observer was positioned at the center of the temple, in a tent or a hut, and watched portions of the sky from which came the birds, which were marked out by stones placed along the perimeter of the temple. From this observation, the priest was believed to be able to predict the future.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], The Religious Experience of the Roman People (London, 1922), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

The auguraculum was structurally a very simple device, a small thatched hut, which appears to have been regularly renewed. There were three permanent auguracula in Rome: on the [[Arx (Roman)|citadel]], on the [[Quirinal Hill]], and on the [[Palatine Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;Auguraculum on the Quirinal: Varro, Lingua Latina, Book V&lt;/ref&gt; [[Festus (historian)|Festus]] said that originally the auguraculum was just the arx. It faced east, situating the north on the augur's left or lucky side. This auguraculum the elected monarch, during the [[Roman Kingdom]], was seated by the augurs with his face to the south.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.lb/books?id=f8spAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=roman+arx&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BtOLT8ybIJHB8QPYvvTPCQ&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=roman%20arx&amp;f=false "An Elementary Manual of Roman Antiquities"], (Griffin, 1859, from Harvard University), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; A magistrate who was serving as a military commander also took daily auspices, and thus a part of camp-building while on campaign was the creation of a tabernaculum augurale. This augural tent was the center of religious and legal proceedings within the camp.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Scheid]], An Introduction to Roman Religion (Indiana University Press, 2003), pp. 113–114; Jerzy Linderski, "The Augural Law", Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt II.16 (1986), pp. 2164–2288, especially p. 2174 on the military auguraculum.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ben Davies''' (1864 - 1937) was a 19th century Welsh poet, and an Independent minister. He grew up in the [[Dolgam]] area, where he received some early education at the local school. At the age of 13 however he entered employment as a miner in a local coal mine.

He began writing poetry at quite a young age, and was awarded prizes at various local literary competitions and Eisteddfodau. At 21 he won the bardic chair at the [[Tredegar]] Eisteddfod for his awdl on Virtue (Rhinwedd). He was also competent at the art of composing [[cynghanedd]].

From 1886-8 he studied at [[Bala, Gwynedd|Bala]] Independent College, before becoming minister of [[Bwlchgwyn]] and Llandegla (1888–91), and then [[Panteg]], Ystalyfera (1891-1926).

He continued his Eisteddfod successes, often winning the chief prizes. In 1896 he published a volume of lyrics, 'Caneuon Bywyd'. He also frequently gave lectures on Welsh literary personalities.

He spent his later years living in [[London]] with his children and died in January 1937.

{{TheravadaBuddhism}}
'''[[Buddhism]]''' is the primary religion of '''[[Laos]]'''. The Buddhism practiced in Laos is of the [[Theravada]] tradition. Lao Buddhism is a unique version of Theravada Buddhism and is at the basis of [[Culture of Laos|Lao culture]].  Buddhism in Laos is often closely tied to [[animism|animist]] beliefs and belief in ancestral spirits, particularly in rural areas.&lt;ref name="locstudy"&gt;{{ cite book|title=Laos: A Country Study|author=Savada, Andrea Matles|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|year=1994|url=http://countrystudies.us/laos/|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The percentage of the population that adheres to Buddhism in modern Laos is variously reported, the [[CIA World Factbook]] estimates 65% of the total population identify as Buddhist.&lt;ref name="ciafactbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/la.html|title=CIA World Factbook- Laos|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The creation of accurate estimates of the number of Buddhists in Laos is complicated by the paucity of information made available by the Laotian government, and the close connection between [[Tai folk religion|Buddhist and animist practices]] in Laos could make the numbers of nominal adherents of both Buddhism-Animism as high as over 90%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90142.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Laos]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also significant numbers of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] or [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] Mahayana Buddhists.

== History ==

=== Early histories of Lao Buddhism ===
Theravada Buddhism is believed to have first reached Laos during the 7th - 8th Centuries CE, via the kingdom of [[Dvaravati]].&lt;ref name="locstudy"/&gt;  During the 7th Century, [[tantra|tantric]] Buddhism was also introduced to Laos from the kingdom of [[Nan-chao]], an ethnically Tai kingdom centered in modern-day [[Yunnan]], China.  The Nan-chao kingdom also likely introduced the political ideology of the king as defender and protector of Buddhism, an important ideological tie between the monarchy and the ''sangha'' in much of Southeast Asia.  We also know very little about the transfer of Buddhism to the region which today is called Laos, but the current state of research suggests that Buddhism did not come in a single movement. According to Michel Lorrillard "the conditions surrounding this penetration remain very imprecise, due to the long duration of this process".{{sfn|Lorrillard |2006|p=144}} From a general perspective, research on the early history of Lao Buddhism had advanced slowly, but recent studies are also signalling progress.{{sfn|Lorrillard |2006|p=}}

During the 11th &amp; 12th Century, rulers took control of [[Muang Sua]], the historical region of the kingdom of [[Luang Prabang]] in northern Laos.  During this period, [[Mahayana]] Buddhism replaced Theravada Buddhism as the dominant religious ideology of the ruling classes.&lt;ref name="locstudy"/&gt;  Epigraphical sources confirm that the early Lao kingdoms display the first clear signs of the Buddhicization of royal power around the middle of the fifteenth century when kings were labeled ''cakkavatti'' (Pali for king as the 'turner of the wheel of the Buddhist dhamma').{{sfn|Lorrillard |2006|p=141}}

Historically, the Lao state is regarded as beginning in 1353 CE with the coronation of [[Fa Ngum]] at Luang Prabang.&lt;ref name="bilaos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/laos-txt.htm" |author=Reat, Noble Ross |accessdate=2007-04-12 |title=Buddhism in Laos |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526092429/http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/laos-txt.htm |archivedate=May 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to local historiography, Fa Ngum brought his [[Khmer people|Khmer]] Theravada teacher with him to act as adviser and head priest of the new kingdom. This Khmer monk named Phramaha Pasaman also brought to the kingdom a revered image of the Buddha that became known as the [[Phra Bang]], the namesake of the city of Luang Prabang and the symbol of the Lao kingdom.&lt;ref name="bilaos"/&gt;  However, Michel Lorrillard asserts the "complete artificial nature of this narrative" and is rather critical of the historical value of the Fa Ngum story.{{sfn|Lorrillard |2006|p=140}} He instead emphasizes the influence of Buddhism from Chiang Mai. Subsequent alliances with [[Burma]] and Thailand helped cement the primacy of Theravada Buddhism in the Laotian kingdom.  As attested in inscriptions, King Photisarath (1501–1547) tried to suppress the worship of spirits and further Buddhicize the population. However, the "animistic" elements of Lao Buddhism have over time survived all purification efforts and are still today of crucial importance.{{sfn|Holt |2009|p=}} Local spirit cults and rituals associated with indigenous ideas of "soul substance" (''khwan'') are in most cases seamlessly integrated into Buddhism, and practitioners rarely see them as contradictive. Faced with rugged, isolating geography and the absence of a strong central government, Theravada Buddhism became one of the primary unifying features of Lao culture.&lt;ref name="bilaos"/&gt;

=== Lao Buddhism and Monastic Education under French Colonialism ===
The French colonial regime from early on sponsored Buddhism and its educational institutions. New curricula were set up, several monasteries were renovated and the educational system for monks was transformed so that it could serve colonial demands.{{sfn|Kourilsky|2006|p=}}{{sfn|McDaniel|2008|p=}} During the 1920s, the administration of Buddhism in Laos was further reorganized by Prince [[Phetsarath]] and the French colonial regime.&lt;ref name="locstudy" /&gt;  In order to subvert the dominance of Thai monastic education in the region, and use Lao and Khmer Buddhism for enhancing colonial control, the French set up institutes for the training of Buddhist monks under the auspices of EFEO. On 24 November 1914 the ''Ecole de Pali'' was founded by royal decree in Phnom Penh and renamed ''Ecole Supérieure de Pali'' in 1922. Having the aim to enhance the study of Buddhism through teaching monks "proper" Pali and Sanskrit, two Cambodian monks were in 1922 sent to EFEO Hanoi for language training.

Lao monks first went to Phnom Penh to study at the Buddhist Institute, but Lao branches were finally opened in 1931, reflecting the peripheral position of Laos in the colonial project. The French introduced new curricula based on the study of selected and appropriate texts, awarded monks with certificates and printed Buddhist books.{{sfn|Kourilsky|2006|p=30f}} Gregory Kourilsky and Soren Ivarsson have explored this restructuring of Buddhist education under French colonialism.{{sfn|Ivarsson |2008|p=93f}}{{sfn|Kourilsky|2006|p=64f}} They argue that the agendas behind this reorganization of Buddhism in Cambodia and Laos were similar: In order to build a national Buddhism within the context of Indochina, Siamese influence had to be curtailed. Instead of Bangkok, the Khmer and the Lao branches of the Buddhist Institute were to become centers for the higher education for monks. This sponsorship and control of Buddhism was also grounded in Buddhism's potential for anti-colonial resistance: During the early phase of French colonialism Buddhist millennial movements caused major troubles for the French regime,{{sfn|Ladwig |2014|p=}}{{sfn|Baird |2013|p=}}{{sfn|Moppert |1978|p=}} and parts of the Khmer sangha also opposed French influence. The influence of these colonial reforms in the field of monastic education were somewhat neutralized by the increasing political struggles during the 1950s, and finally the socialist revolution in 1975. However, during the first years of independence until 1975, signs of secularization also became visible in the domain of monastic education: While a state school system was spreading, monastic education became an increasingly specialized subfield.{{sfn|Taillard |1974|p=}}{{sfn|Ladwig |2011|p=}}

=== Political Struggles and the coming of the revolution: Buddhism and the Pathet Lao ===

The Communist treatment of religion in Laos has diverged from the experience of many other countries which have had a communist regime. Instead of repressing or banning religion outright, the Communists in Laos used the Buddhist [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] as a vehicle to achieve political aims. Officially, Marxist theory rejects religion because it is seen as a tool used by the ruling classes to mislead the oppressed classes and to keep them subservient. Even though the [[Pathet Lao]] saw Buddhism as an antithesis of [[Marxism]], they were able to reconcile aspects of Buddhism with Marxism.{{sfn|Lafont |1982|p=150}}{{sfn|Brown |1986|pp=228–299}}   
The Pathet Lao saw Buddhism and Marxism conflicting on these principles:
*Marxism rejects all forms of religion;
*Buddhism's spiritual vision of the universe conflicts with Marxism's materialistic vision;
*Buddhism regards material attachment as the cause of suffering whereas Marxism bases its utopian vision on the material world;
*Buddhism strives for harmony whereas the Marxists see a constant class struggle between different classes; and
*Buddhism eschews the use of violence while Marxism approves the use of violence where necessary.{{sfn|Lafont |1982|p=150}}{{sfn|Brown|1986|p=230}}
The Pathet Lao re-interpreted Buddhism by affirming that there was no conflict between the teaching of the [[Gautama Buddha]] and revolutionary aims.{{sfn|Morev|1998|pp=33–34}} They focused on the life story of the Gautama Buddha. Gautama's rejection of royal status and his choice of becoming a mendicant could be considered revolutionary as he rejected the trappings of wealth and the privilege of the ruling elite. People were not accorded status based on caste or wealth but were accepted as long as they accepted the [[Dhamma]]. The Pathet Lao claimed that Buddha had already envisioned a [[classless society]] because of his rejection of class distinction. The Pathet Lao also pointed out Buddhism had a strong dimension of social justice as the Gautama Buddha was interested in the material welfare of people and he wanted to relieve the lot of the poor. {{sfn|Brown |1986|p=228}} Poverty was seen as a root of evil and as a cause of crime. A minimal level of material well-being was necessary before the Dhamma could be practised. This was not too different from the Pathet Lao's aim of redistributing wealth. The Pathet Lao also pointed out both Buddhism and Marxism were interested in the ultimate happiness of people; they both aimed  to help people escape from suffering;  the only difference was in their method of achieving happiness.{{sfn|Morev |1998|p=34}}{{sfn|Lafont |1982|p=150}}{{sfn|Brown |1986|p=228}}  Both Buddhism and Marxism rejects the capitalist system.{{sfn|Pholsena |2006|p=71}}

According to the Pathet Lao, Buddhism and Marxism advocated different solutions because they were the evolutionary product of societies at different stages of development. Buddhism was a historical product of a pre-industrial age while Marxism was the scientific ideology of the industrial age. Buddhism was acceptable and it was useful as a tool of the revolution if it was purged of superstitious practices which had accrued over time.{{sfn|Lafont|1982|p=150}}

'''Politicisation of the Sangha'''

The Pathet Lao's choice to co-opt Buddhism into its revolutionary struggle had a historical basis. Traditionally, the [[monarchy]] and the Sangha had a reciprocal relationship. The Sangha aimed to remain on good terms with the state.{{sfn|Morev |1998|p=32}}  The king's right to rule was based on his submission to the Dhamma. He only ruled through the power of the [[Three Jewels]] of Buddhism: [[Buddha]], the Dhamma and the Sangha. In return for the Sangha's support and legitimation of his rule, the king had to support the upkeep of the Sangha and promote the Dhamma in the kingdom. This was a relationship based on mutual benefits.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|pp=68–69}}{{sfn|Grabowsky |2007|p=133}}  The role of the king was to run the secular affairs of the country while the Sangha also derived its moral authority by being detached and aloof from mundane affairs.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=72}}

French colonial rule resulted in the marginalization of the Sangha. It was during the Japanese occupation of [[French Indochina]] that a nascent Lao nationalist movement began to pay attention to traditional Lao culture. The nationalist movement focused on the role of Buddhism in Lao society and on the Sangha as a repository of traditional Lao values.{{sfn|Pholsena |2006|p=67}} Many young monks became involved in this resurgence of nationalism. It also meant that the traditional role of the Sangha was changing. The Sangha was no longer purely occupied with the spiritual realm; it had crossed into the secular realm.{{sfn|Ladwig |2011|p=}} With the exile of the [[Lao Issara]] government in Thailand after the resumption of French control in 1946, the Sangha played a significant role in fanning nationalist sentiment in Laos. They also provided financial support by using Buddhist festivals as fundraisers.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=88}} In 1950, the Lao Issara movement split into two factions. The moderate faction supported independence within the [[French Union]] while the radical faction supported the armed struggle of the [[Viet Minh]]. Some monks actually joined the Pathet Lao, while other monks used Buddhist teachings to bolster the liberation struggle.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=88}} This was effective because of the great moral impact of the Sangha on Lao society.{{sfn|Brown|1986|p=221}}{{sfn|Lafont |1982|p=148}} As a result, both the government in [[Vientiane]] and the Pathet Lao sought to use the Sangha as a vehicle for their political aims.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=88}}{{sfn|Brown|1986|p=220}}

In the First Coalition government of 1957, the Pathet Lao held religious affairs as one of their two portfolios.  The Minister for Religious Affairs, [[Phoumi Vongvichit]] was a communist and there was a tactical reason for the Pathet Lao to take this portfolio.{{sfn|Brown |1986|p=223}} The Ministry of Religious Affairs supervised the Sangha directly, a function it inherited from its colonial predecessor. Information and instructions could be transmitted via the Sangha ranks without recourse to the civil administration. This meant that the communists were now in control of a communication network which fanned out from Vientiane to the most inaccessible villages.{{sfn|Ladwig |2009|p=}} The ministry funds were also used to pay for monastic meetings where pro-communist ideas could be promulgated. This technique was so effective that even though the Coalition government collapsed in a matter of months, many monks had already been won to the side of the Pathet Lao.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=88}} Communist propaganda was also incorporated into Buddhism sermons: the right wing forces were equated with evil and the Communists were seen as the forces of good.{{sfn|Brown |1986|p=223}}

'''Rightist Attempt to Co-Opt the Sangha'''

The success of the Pathet Lao in using the Sangha for their political aims goaded the government in Vientiane and their American supporters into action by trying to bring the Sangha firmly under their control. The rightist government of [[Phoui Sananikone]], which took power after the failure of the First Coalition government, tried to control the Sangha by passing legislation in the form of Royal Ordinance number 160 on 25 May 1959.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=89}}{{sfn|Evans|1998|p=52}} It defined government control of the internal affairs of the Sangha. Government officials could veto elections of abbots and elders and candidates for higher positions in the Sangha required Cabinet consent. Correspondence between the various administrative divisions of the Sangha had to go via the civil administration. This was an attempt to turn the Sangha into another branch of the executive. This resulted in tension between the Sangha and the government and led to unrest in the Sangha.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=89}}{{sfn|Brown |1986|p=222}} This proved to be opportune for the Pathet Lao who were quick to exploit these tensions to their own interests. The Americans trained some of the monks, who were then expected to speak against the Communists. Lao-speaking monks from Thailand were also sent to Laos to join the ideological battle against the Communists.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=89}}{{sfn|Brown|1986|p=222}} These monks were from the Thammanyut-nikay sect, a reform sect which had been founded in Thailand. The Thammanyut-nikay sect was a minority sect in Laos, as opposed to the majority Maha-nikay sect. The immediate consequences of all these actions led to further tensions between the government and the Sangha.{{sfn|Brown|1986|p=222}} This was quickly exploited by the Pathet Lao.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=89}} Two underground movements, with Pathet Lao support was founded to fight against American and government influence in the affairs of the Sangha. They were the "Movement of Young Monks against the Thai Thammanyut monks" and the "Movement of Novices to Demand their Rights".{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=90}}

In addition, many members of the Sangha were already pre-disposed to anti-government propaganda of the Communists due to the "inverse class structure" of the Sangha.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=90}}{{sfn|Brown|1986|p=222}} Under the French administration, the Lao elite was educated in secular schools. The poor could only be educated in the monasteries. Jobs in the government were offered to the French-educated elite; those who were educated in monasteries were denied jobs in the government on the grounds that their religious education was irrelevant for government jobs. Many of those students who were educated in the monasteries had to remain as monks and they harboured grudges against the government.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=90}}{{sfn|Brown|1986|p=222}} This was aggravated by the fact that many members of the Sangha, especially those in rural areas only received a rudimentary education and were ill-disciplined. They only had a flimsy knowledge of the Dhamma and were susceptible to Marxist manipulations of Buddhism.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=91}}{{sfn|Brown|1986|p=223}}{{sfn|Morev|2002|p=396}}

'''Sangha as an organ of propaganda'''

During the Lao Civil War, the Pathet Lao actively used members of the Sangha in their [[propaganda]] campaign.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=93}}{{sfn|Brown |1986|p=221}} For example, a seized Pathet Lao document dated 14 January 1968 reports how the Pathet Lao had sent out thirty-three monks "to preach revolutionary ethics….to protect Buddhism, to revive the real morality, to explain the revolutionary tasks to the people, and to resist the psychological warfare of the American imperialists and their reactionary lackeys".{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=93}} According to the Pathet Lao, members of the Sangha could be transformed into revolutionaries.{{sfn|Ladwig |2009|p=}} This is because the monk has renounced material possessions and is no longer motivated by selfish personal interests. The monk was seeking the betterment of humanity.  As such, the monk could not stand idly by and allow the oppression of the common people. To allow such injustice was a betrayal of Buddhism. The Pathet Lao also officially accepted Buddhism in the zones under their control.{{sfn|Brown |1986|p=220}}{{sfn|Lafont |1982|p=151}}

With the proclamation of the [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]] on 2 Dec 1975, the Pathet Lao needed to establish their legitimacy to rule, especially in zones that used to be controlled by the rightists. They actively promoted an eighteen-point political programme with the slogan "Laos: Peaceful, Independent, Neutral, Democratic, United and Prosperous".{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=95}}  The liberal democratic tone of the document appealed to most people. These included unity and equality of all Lao nationals of all ethnic groups, free elections, freedom of speech and the right to free enterprise and property ownership. The fifth point included a call to respect and protect all religions, especially Buddhism. Naturally, the Sangha supported these eighteen points.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=94}}{{sfn|Brown |1986|p=221}} They recruited as many monks as possible to preach these eighteen points in the rural areas.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=95}}{{sfn|Evans|1998|p=61}} The Pathet Lao message benefited from the goodwill felt by the people towards the Sangha as this message was promoted via the monks. At the same time it must be noted that the monks were accompanied by armed Pathet Lao cadres on their preaching tours, supposedly for their protection. Their sermons were also tape-recorded to ensure that they kept to the official party line.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=99}} Monks who did not support the eighteen point political programme were criticised.{{sfn|Baird|2012|p=662}}

The [[Sangharaja]] or the Supreme Patriarch of Buddhism in Laos also urged the monks to work with the revolutionaries for the good of the nation. A booklet entitled "Action Plan for the Lao Sangha" was prepared. It noted the importance of the Sangha and emphasised the importance of the Sangha as mediators  in Lao society. This indicated how the Pathet Lao intended to use the ecclesiastical weight of the Sangha to settle disputes they may face in their transition to power. Monks were to serve as a channel of communication between the Party and the people.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=95}}

=== The Sangha under Communist Rule – 1975 to 1979 ===
Monks were the first to attend Pathet Lao political seminars. At first, they attended voluntarily but as these seminars became protracted re-education classes, monks had to be forced to attend. In these seminars, the monks were taught the Pathet Lao interpretation of Buddhism.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=96}} Monks were taught Marxism-Leninism in Buddhist institutes.{{sfn|Brown |1986|p=229}}{{sfn|Morev|1998|p=33}} Both Marxism and Buddhism taught the equality of all men. The Sangha, as a community of men who lived and worked together without individual ownership of property, was similar to a Marxist collective. Both Marxism and Buddhism at an abstract level, aimed to liberate mankind from suffering and to attain happiness.  The Pathet Lao tried to purge Buddhism of such superstition as belief in the existence of demons, or of life after death in one of the Buddhist heavens or hells.  The accumulation of merit was downplayed; and karma was denounced as leading to fatalism and pacifism.{{sfn|Holt |2009|p=146}}

While proclaiming that Buddhism and Marxism was compatible, the Pathet Lao also sought actively to replace the Dhamma with [[Marxism-Leninism]].  They also sought to discourage merit making, as it was seen as a diversion of scarce resources.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=97}}{{sfn|Brown |1986|p=224}} To the Pathet Lao, religion still conflicted with the formation of an orthodox Marxist-Leninist state. Ironically, the Pathet Lao's attack on the popular aspects of Lao Buddhist practice such as spirit worship and use of special amulets may have actually led to an increased orthodoxy in Lao Buddhism as it is reverting closer to Buddha's original teachings.{{sfn|Brown |1986|p=229}}{{sfn|Lafont |1982|p=159}} Thai followers of [[Buddhadasa]] are of the opinion that Lao Buddhism has freed itself from false beliefs and local accretions. They point out that spirit worship and the blessing of amulets, which were not part of Buddha's teachings, have been prohibited.{{sfn|Lafont |1982|p=159}}

More importantly, the Sangha remained as an alternative route to social advancement outside the Lao People's Revolutionary Party or [[LPRP]], the political wing of the Pathet Lao. The Pathet Lao sought to make the Sangha an instrument of party policy. It was also important to control the Sangha as it was one of the few organisations that had penetrated every village in Laos.{{sfn|Evans|1998|p=57}} The sectarian divisions between Maha-nikay and Thammanyut-nikay was abolished and  the Sangha was restructured as the Lao United Buddhists Association.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=99}}{{sfn|Brown|1986|p=225}}{{sfn|Morev|2002|p=398}}{{sfn|Baird|2012|p=662}}  This association was placed under the auspices of the Department of Religious Affairs in the Ministry of Education.{{sfn|Lafont |1982|p=152}} The traditional Sangha hierarchy, including the Sangharaja was abolished and their elaborate fans which were the symbols of their ranks, were smashed. Executive positions in the Lao United Buddhists Association were filled by Party appointees.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=99}}{{sfn|Brown |1986|p=225}} All high ranking monks had to attend month long political indoctrination classes. Theravada monks have to attend a fortnightly recitation of the patimokha or the 227 verses of monastic discipline in [[Pali]]. This became transformed as a forum to criticise monks who had strayed from the Party line. Monks began to leave the Sangha or flee to Thailand.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=99}}{{sfn|Baird |2012|p=662}}

At the beginning of 1976, a number of attacks were mounted against Buddhism. The teaching of religion and Buddhist morality was prohibited in primary schools. Buddhist monks were harassed by local cadres.{{sfn|Lafont |1982|p=152}} These attacks did not last as it led to great public opposition.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=101}} The Pathet Lao also realised that they still needed the monks for their propaganda objectives. By the end of 1976, these pressures on the Sangha ceased.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=101}} These pressures also ceased at the same time that the Pathet Lao completed the reorganisation of the Sangha. Monks are still invited to attend all secular state occasions, such as National Day.{{sfn|Brown |1986|p=225}}{{sfn|Morev |1998|p=32}} Official government delegations have attended major Buddhist festivals such as the [[Pha That Luang Festival|That Luang Festival]].{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=107}} (Trankell 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;198).  Although monks are not harassed, they have to use their sermons to encourage the people to support the Party and its policies.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=106}}{{sfn|Brown |1986|p=226}} This also had the effect of reducing the prestige of the Sangha in the eyes of the laity.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=98}} Traditionally, the independence of the Sangha acted as the foundation of its moral authority; it was aloof and detached from mundane affairs. By using the monks as a vehicle of political indoctrination, the moral authority of the Sangha was weakened.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=107}}

Refugee Lao monks and anti-communist informants have reported that the situation in Laos was much more serious.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=104}} Pressure against the Sangha increased between 1976 and 1979. One monk who left Vientiane in December 1976 said that pressure was only subtle and indirect. Monks who did not toe the party line were disciplined by the Sangha and monks were sent on re-education courses but none had been executed.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=105}} By 1979, 1000 monks were reported to have been confined to re-education camps.{{sfn|Brown |1986|p=227}} Another monk who fled Southern Laos in May 1978 reported more heavy-handed methods. There were unverified reports that monks had been arrested and shot.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=105}} In March 1979, the eighty-seven-year-old Sangharaja of Laos, Venerable Thammayano, fled to Thailand by floating across the [[Mekong]] on a raft of inflated car inner tubes. He had been confined to his monastery and was not allowed to preach (Zago 1978). He stated that youths were dissuaded from joining the Sangha and that monastic teachings had to adhere to government guidelines.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=105}}{{sfn|Brown |1986|p=225}} There was a serious decrease in the number of monks in the Lao Sangha during this period.{{sfn|Brown |1986|p=227}}{{sfn|Morev|2002|p=396}} Some monks left the Sangha, many fled and some were sent to labour camps. Young novices were persuaded by the government to leave the Sangha with offers of secular training and education and special vocational schools were set up for them.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=105}} This was not aided by the loss of prestige of the Lao Sangha, which was being seen as a tool of government policy.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=98}} The significant number of monks who had escaped to Thailand and monks who aided the anti-communist insurgents demonstrates that the regime's attempt to co-opt the Sangha was not completely successful.{{sfn|Baird |2012|p=}}

=== The Situation of Buddhism after 1979 ===
The official attitudes towards Buddhism began to liberalise, in tandem with economic liberalization in the late 1980s.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=107}} The Buddhist Sangha has expanded their traditional roles. Previously, they focused on teaching Buddhism but they also assist in adult literacy programs after the formation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic. They teach the Lao language and other subjects in places where schools are not available or where teachers are not available. They play a prominent role in education, especially early education.{{sfn|Morev|1998|p=34}} They continue their role as traditional healers in a country where doctors are scarce. However, they are prohibited from issuing cures of a spiritualist nature. They can dispense traditional herbal cures and Western medicines.{{sfn|Lafont |1982|p=153}}{{sfn|Morev|1998|p=35}} In this sense, the Buddhist Sangha have had to re-invent themselves by emphasising their utilitarian roles in Lao society.{{sfn|Lafont |1982|p=153}}{{sfn|Ladwig |2007|p=}} The Sangha has become seen as a preserver of national culture, especially in the maintenance of [[wat]]s and monasteries.{{sfn|Morev|1998|p=35}} Buddhism has survived because it remains central to the cultural identity of Laos, and Buddhism is inextricably interwoven with Lao culture.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=108}}

=== Contemporary Lao Buddhism and the Current Situation ===
By the early 1990s, Buddhism was on the resurgence. The wat still remained as an important focus of social life. Lines of monks could accept morning offerings from the faithful without interference and attendance at Buddhist ceremonies increased again. At the annual [[Pha That Luang Festival]], most members of the Politburo could be seen making offerings to monks.{{sfn|Stuart-Fox|1996|p=107}} (Trenkell 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;198). Now party officials also engage more visibly in the worship of the relics enshrined in this monument and thereby reaffirm the relationship between Buddhism and the state  - a long-standing feature of Buddhism, its cosmology and the political sphere.{{sfn|Ladwig |2015|p=}} Moreover, in 2003 and 2010 the Ministry of Information and Culture inaugurated statues of King Fa Ngum and King Anouvong''.'' The rituals surrounding the worship of relics and statues have become displays of the patronage power of the Lao government that thereby is intending to connect itself to a glorious Buddhist past in order to increase its legitimacy in the present.{{sfn|Ladwig |2015|p=}} However, many state rituals have also been carefully re-engineered since 1975.

While government policy towards religion has liberalized, the Sangha remains under Party control and monks have to study official government policy.{{sfn|Pholsena |2006|p=89}} Since the 1990s, the Sangha has been re-oriented as a primarily religious organisation.{{sfn|Morev|2002|p=397}}  With Buddhist institutions being still firmly integrated into the Party State, Buddhism and the language, moral values and lifestyles associated with it, are now again promoted as "national culture". Vatthana Pholsena describes this as "a secularized image of Buddhism in order to reconcile the official ideology and the religion."{{sfn|Pholsena |2006|p=70}} A process of the Buddhification of the political sphere, but also everyday culture and is observable, at least in regions with a high proportion of ethnic Lao.{{sfn|Evans|1998|p=67}}

Buddhist institutes for the training of monks have been devoting more time to the teaching of religious disciplines such as the foundation of the Dhamma, the disciplinary code, Pali, the life of the Buddha and the Buddhist canon.{{sfn|Morev|2002|p=398}} Monks appear to give talks on television and radio and they are allowed to give talks in schools and have access to patients in hospitals.{{sfn|Morev|2002|p=398}} Lately, a kind of socially engaged Buddhism has also developed in Laos. Monks are now active in HIV-and drug-prevention programs and expand into other areas that mix social work, environmental protection and education.{{sfn|Ladwig |2008|p=}} The UNESCO world heritage status of Luang Prabang has also led to more global engagements of its Buddhist institutions: The highest ranking monk of Luang Prabang Maha Khamchan Virachitto (1920-2007) kept his transnational networks even during the time of socialism active, and has had a major impact on the resurgence of Buddhism in Laos (Boulyaphonh 2014, Sengsoulin 2014). The large collection of photos he left after his death, and those of other laypeople and monks taken over the last hundred years, are now being transformed into an archive that will be of great value for documenting the past of the religious culture of the city.

== Buddhism in Laotian Culture ==

Lao Buddhist are very devout and almost every Lao man joins a [[monastery]], or temple, for at least a short period of time. Many men also become monks for the rest of their lives. Most people donate food to the monks to gain merit and improve their [[karma]].  The temples of Laos were once seen as "Universities" for monks. Lao [[Buddhist monk|monks]] are highly respected and revered in Lao communities.  Based on 
Laotian Buddhism, the [[women of Laos]] are taught that they can only attain [[nirvana]] after they have been reborn as men.&lt;ref name=Active&gt;[http://www.activetravellaos.com/country/?p=66 Women in Laos], activetravellaos, 2005. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903065518/http://www.activetravellaos.com/country/?p=66 |date=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art and Architecture ===
The [[Pha That Luang]], [[Wat Sisakhet]], [[Wat Xieng Thong]], and [[That Dam]] are all Buddhist structures in Laos. Lao Buddhism is also famous for [[Lao Buddhist sculpture|images]] of the [[Buddha Shakyamuni|Buddha]] performing uniquely Lao [[mudras]], or gestures, such as calling for rain, and striking uniquely Lao poses such as showing the Buddha lying down and welcoming [[death]], after which he would achieve Nirvana. During the colonial era, Henri Parmentier undertook a massive survey of Lao arts and architecture that remains of crucial value for the general documentation of this field before the destruction that took place in the 1960s and 1970s (Parmentier 1988).

=== Literature ===
In the [[Pra Lak Pra Lam]], the Lao [[Ramayana]], instead of having [[Rama]] portrayed as an [[incarnation]] of [[Vishnu]], Rama is  an incarnation of the Buddha. Lao people have also written many versions of the [[Jataka Tales]]. See the study by Sahai (1973) and Ladwig (2016) for more specific accounts of these narratives and their associated rituals, and especially Peltier (1987) for an excellent overview of the rich literary tradition of Laos. Louis Finot's extensive overview of Lao Buddhist manuscripts is somewhat dated, but remains one of the best studies ever undertaken on this subject (Finot 1917).

'''Buddhism in Wales''' has a relatively short history, having only really established a presence in the country in the 20th Century. 9,117 people in [[Wales]] declared themselves [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] in the 2011 Census, representing a number of Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Census: KS209EW Religion, local authorities in England and Wales |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262|publisher=ons.gov.uk|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tibetan Buddhism]] is particularly well represented with branches of several different traditions and lineages, notably [[Shenpen Hookham|Lama Shenpen Hookham]]'s Awakened Heart Sangha, based in North Wales. [[Zen]] Buddhism has several groups in Wales and three [[Soto Zen]] masters are currently resident and actively teaching. The [[Samatha]] Trust, a lay [[Theravada]] group, have their headquarters in Wales as does the Tibetan group, Awakened Heart Sangha. The [[Triratna Buddhist Community]] have a number of groups and a large [[Cardiff]] Buddhist Centre. The Nyingma Aro gTér Lineage has been active in Wales since 1981. The Aro gTér Lineage Holders, Ngak’chang Rinpoche and Khandro Déchen, are resident in Wales and have written a large number of publications about Vajrayana Buddhist practice (see Aro Books worldwide and Aro Books Inc). Another Welsh author of this lineage is Ngakma Nor’dzin Pamo who is a teacher at Aro Ling Cardiff.

The Buddhist Council of Wales [http://www.buddhistcouncilofwales.org.uk] has a growing number of Buddhist organisations and groups listed on their website. The Council is active in representing Buddhism and has two delegates on the [[National Assembly for Wales]] Faith Communities Forum and two on the Interfaith Council for Wales.

One notable Welsh person to have converted to Buddhism is former rugby star [[Ricky Evans (rugby union)|Ricky Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3368673.stm Rugby star on Buddhist life] BBC News, 5 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Duk-Duk''' is a [[secret society]], part of the traditional culture of the [[Tolai people|Tolai]] people of the [[Rabaul]] area of [[New Britain]], the largest [[island]] in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] of [[Papua New Guinea]], in the South Pacific. 
 
==Description==
The society has religious and political as well as social objectives.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Duk-Duk|volume=8|page=650}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents a form of law and order through its presiding spirits. In ritual dances, members of the society invoke the male spirit ''duk duk'' and female spirit ''tubuan'' depending on which mask the dancer wears.&lt;ref name="D'Alleva"&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Alleva|first=Anne|title=Arts of the Pacific Islands|date=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=978-0-300-16412-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dancers are always male despite the fact that some are performing the role of female spirits.&lt;ref name="D'Alleva" /&gt;  Women and children were forbidden to look at these figures.&lt;ref name="AM Blog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Christmas, Costumes and Ceremonies|url=http://blog.aucklandmuseum.com/2012/12/christmas-costumes-and-ceremonies/|work=Auckland Museum Blog|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both types of mask are cone-shaped and are constructed of cane and fibre, with short, bushy capes of leaves. Traditionally the ''duk duk'' was taller than the ''tubuan'' and was faceless. The ''tubuan'' had circular eyes and a crescent-shaped mouth painted on a dark background. In addition to the mask, leaves cover the torso of the dancers so that only their legs are visible.&lt;ref name="D'Alleva" /&gt;

Only males could belong to Duk-Duk, with an entrance fee (in [[dewarra]], small [[cowry]] shells strung on strips of cane, often 100 metres or more).

The society has its secret signs and rituals, and festivals which were in past times closed to strangers on pain of death. Duk-Duk only appeared with the full moon.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Justice was executed, fines extorted, taboos, feasts, taxes and all tribal matters arranged by the Duk-Duk members, wearing  masks or chalk on their faces. In carrying out punishments, they were allowed to burn houses and even kill people.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Dancers wearing the ''tubuan'' masks were regarded as divine beings whose judgment and actions could not be questioned.&lt;ref name=Salisbury&gt;{{cite book|last=Salisbury|first=Richard Frank|title=Vunamami: Economic Transformation in a Traditional Society|date=1970|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society's practice has been dying out since around the start of the 20th century, but Duk-Duk dancers are now featured as tourist attractions.

&lt;!--as Edward Hoch redirects here--&gt;

'''Edward Dentinger Hoch''' (February 22, 1930 &amp;ndash; January 17, 2008) was an American writer of [[detective fiction]].  Although he wrote several novels, he was primarily known for his vast output of over 950 short stories.

==Biography==
Hoch (pronounced ''hoke'') was born in [[Rochester, New York]] and  began writing in the 1950s; his first story appeared in 1955 in ''[[Famous Detective Stories]]'' and was followed by stories in ''[[The Saint Mystery Magazine]]''.  In January 1962 he began appearing in ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine]]''.  In December 1962 he kicked off his most successful collaboration, with the appearance of his first story in ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]''; in the years since ''EQMM'' has published over 450 of Hoch's stories, roughly half of his total output.  In May 1973 ''EQMM'' began publishing a new Hoch story in every monthly issue; as of May 2007 the author had gone an astonishing 34 years without missing a single issue.

Other magazines Hoch wrote for included ''[[Adventure (magazine)|Adventure]]'', ''[[Double-Action Detective]]'',
''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'', 
''[[Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine]]'', ''[[Robert A. W. Lowndes|The Magazine of Horror]]'' and ''[[Web Detective Stories]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Francis M. Nevins Jr., "Hoch, Edward D(entinger)", in ''Twentieth Century Crime and Mystery Writers'', edited by James Vinson and D.L. Kirkpatrick. St. James Press, 1985. pp. 452-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoch was a master of the classic detective story, emphasizing mystery and deduction rather than suspense and fast action; ''EQMM'' has called him "The King of the Classical [[Whodunit]]."  His stories are very well written and are usually tightly plotted puzzles, with carefully and fairly presented clues, both physical and psychological.  He was particularly partial to "impossible crime" tales, where to all appearances the crime (usually a murder) could not have been committed at all; he invented numerous variants on the [[locked room mystery]] popularized by [[John Dickson Carr]] and others.  For instance, in "The Second Problem of the Covered Bridge", a man is shot at close range while alone on a covered bridge, while crowds of witnesses watch both ends of the bridge. Hoch cited [[Graham Greene]], John Dickson Carr, 
[[Ellery Queen]] and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] as influences on his fiction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Hoch also published magazine stories under the names "Stephen Dentinger", "R. L. Stevens", "Pat McMahon", "Anthony Circus", "Irwin Booth", "R. E. Porter", "Mr. X" and the House Name "Ellery Queen".  In many cases he also had a story under his own name in the same magazine issue.  Hoch also wrote a novel published as Ellery Queen, under the supervision and editing of Manfred Lee, half of the writing partnership known as Ellery Queen.

In 2001 Hoch was named a [[MWA Grand Master Award|Grand Master]] by the [[Mystery Writers of America]], the first time a Grand Master was known primarily for short fiction rather than novels.

Hoch, a Catholic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somethingisgoingtohappen.net/2012/05/30/memories-of-ed-by-doug-greene/ |title="Memories of Ed" (by Doug Greene) |publisher=Somethingisgoingtohappen.et |date=2012-05-30 |accessdate=2015-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; died at home in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] of a heart attack, aged 77. His wife, née Patricia McMahon, was his only immediate survivor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/24/arts/24hoch.html|title=Edward D. Hoch, Writer of Over 900 Mystery Stories, Is Dead at 77|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series stories==
The overwhelming majority of Hoch's stories feature series characters.  He has created at least a dozen different series of stories for ''EQMM'' alone.  His Captain Leopold series reached over 100 stories.

Since his first appearance in ''EQMM'' in September 1966, he has stolen such things as an old spiderweb (which he was then obliged to replace), a day-old newspaper, and a used teabag.  His original fee for a theft was $20,000.  In 1980 he raised it to $25,000 at the urging of his long-time girlfriend Gloria (who met Nick in 1965 when he was burgling her New York apartment); in the 21st century his fee has risen to $50,000.  Unlike many fictional thieves, Nick usually works alone on his thefts&amp;mdash;in fact, until 1979 Gloria believed that Nick worked for the U.S. government.

:The Nick Velvet [[caper story|caper stories]] generally combine a near-impossible theft with the mystery of why someone would pay $20,000 to have an apparently valueless item stolen.  Although Nick often appears as devoid of curiosity as his targets are of value, circumstances usually force him to identify his clients' true motives, making him as much of a detective as Hoch's more conventional characters.  Most of the Nick Velvet stories have a light and humorous tone reminiscent of [[Leslie Charteris]]' early stories of [[Simon Templar|the Saint]].  The fundamental immorality of Nick's chosen profession is frequently offset by the larger justice resulting from his detective work.

:A Nick Velvet story, "The Theft of the Circus Poster" in May 1973, began Hoch's unbroken string of monthly appearances in ''EQMM''.  Another story, "The Theft of the Rusty Bookmark" in January 1998 featured the real-life Mysterious Bookshop of New York City, and its real-life owner (and Edgar-winning publisher and editor), [[Otto Penzler]].  "The Theft of Gloria's Greatcoat" (May 1998), which describes the first meeting of Nick and Gloria, is unusual in that it is told in the [[first-person narrative|first person]] by Gloria; all of the other Nick Velvet stories (and indeed the majority of Hoch's stories) are [[third-person narrative]]s.

===Captain Leopold===
:Captain Jules Leopold is a police detective, the head of the Violent Crimes Squad of the police department for the fictional city of Monroe, [[New York (state)|New York]], a city apparently modeled on Hoch's own home town, [[Rochester, New York]].  Along with his colleagues Lieutenant Fletcher and Sergeant Connie Trent, he is one of Hoch's most conventional characters.  The Leopold stories are [[police procedural]]s on the surface, showing the interaction of the officers as they investigate crimes, but the crimes themselves are frequently unusual and reflect Hoch's skill at plotting and placement of clues.  The story outcomes usually depend on the deductive ability of Leopold and his comrades rather than on straightforward police work, and sometimes feature impossible crimes and locked rooms.

:The Leopold stories best illustrate one of the attractions of Hoch's series tales:  The characters age and alter realistically with time.  In the course of the series, Leopold has divorced, remarried, retired, returned to work, and retired a second time.  Lieutenant Fletcher has been promoted to captain to replace him, and Connie Trent has been promoted to Lieutenant.  In some of the recent stories, the focus is on Fletcher and Trent, with Leopold only acting as a respected adviser.

:Leopold first appeared as a subsidiary character in a 1957 story.  In "The Theft of Leopold's Badge" in March 1991, Hoch brought Captain Leopold and Nick Velvet together in the same story.

:''EQMM'' has published the majority of the Leopold stories, but a number have appeared in ''AHMM'' as well.  The [[Edgar Award|Edgar]]-winning "The Oblong Room," perhaps the most frequently reprinted Leopold story, was first published in ''The Saint Magazine''.

===Dr. Sam Hawthorne===
:Dr. Sam Hawthorne is a retired family practitioner who is also a specialist in impossible murders.  His tales are told as reminiscences of his small-town medical practice in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s.  Sam Hawthorne tries to live a quiet life in the fictional New England town of Northmont, but wherever he goes someone always seems to die in a most improbable way.

:First appearing in 1974, the Dr. Sam Hawthorne stories are carefully researched historical pieces, rich with period details about Sam's cars, medical practices of the times, politics, and clothing.  The stories of this series are among Hoch's most humane tales:  Sam himself is a cheerful fellow and tells his tales with humor, but his first-person narratives give readers a close look at his distress at the murders he investigates and his sympathy for the survivors.  Because most of the tales take place in a single small town, the series has a larger-than-usual cast of recurring minor characters.

:Each Hawthorne story is a "[[locked room mystery]]", where an impossible crime occurs, usually a murder.

:The earlier tales of the series include one peculiar device:  Each one ends with a hint about the next story's central puzzle, and each one begins with a reference to the previous story's hint.  Such a device is sometimes inserted when stories are anthologized, to make them seem more like a continuous narrative, but it is very unusual in the initial publication of independent stories in a series.

:In "The Problem of Suicide Cottage" (''EQMM'', July 2007), it is revealed old Sam is 80 years old, and has a daughter named Samantha.  He is telling his stories in 1976, and was born in 1896.

===Rand===
:Jeffery (sometimes Jeffrey) Rand is a code and cipher expert, formerly with the Department of Concealed Communications of British intelligence.  The Rand stories take place in exotic locations around the world, and frequently feature secret messages or codes.  After he left Concealed Communications, many of his stories involved his half-Egyptian, half-Scots wife, Lella Gaad, who Rand met in "The Spy and The Nile Mermaid".  Rand met another Hoch character, Michael Vlado, in "The Spy and the Gypsy".

===Simon Ark===
:Simon Ark was the protagonist of Hoch's first published story and ultimately featured in 39 short stories, the best of which Hoch collected in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Edward D. Hoch, ''The Quests of Simon Ark'' (New York: Mysterious Press, 1984) ({{ISBN|0892961139}})&lt;/ref&gt;  Ark appears to be an ordinary man in his sixties, tall and stout, but many of the stories contain suggestions that he is actually over 2000 years old, a [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] priest who travels the world looking for evil&amp;mdash;specifically, Satan.  It is said that he is cursed by God, that when Jesus carrying the cross wanted to rest, Ark refused him rest and in turn has never known rest himself, doomed to wander the globe forever (although at least one story suggests Ark was instead the author of a fraudulent [[gospel]] so pious that God was unable to punish him with [[hell]] or reward him with [[heaven]], and so left him on the Earth instead). However the immortality element is not played up in any way and is just incidental. The Simon Ark stories have supernatural themes, although the crimes in them are always found to have been committed by mundane means.  In the introduction to his 1984 collection, Hoch left the matter of Simon Ark's real nature a matter for the reader to ponder.  The 1984 volume presents what Hoch deemed to be the nine best of the 39 stories that he devoted to Simon Ark; it concludes with a list of all 39 stories, giving details of their original publications. (It's worth bearing in mind that there were 39 stories as of 1984. He wrote others subsequently.)

===Ben Snow===
:Ben Snow features in a series of [[American Old West]] mysteries set around the start of the 20th century.  Like the Dr. Sam Hawthorne series, these tales are carefully researched historical pieces, sometimes including real historical characters such as [[Butch Cassidy]].  He met another Hoch character, Sam Hawthorne, in "The Problem of the Haunted Teepee".

:The first Ben Snow series appeared in 1961 in ''The Saint Mystery Magazine''; the series has since been continued in ''EQMM''.

===Stanton and Ives===
:Walt Stanton and Juliet Ives are two Princeton graduates turned international couriers that have appeared in newer stories, beginning with "Courier and Ives" in November 2002.  The pair are often sent to pick up or retrieve an item, and end up picking up the mystery around it.

===Sir Gideon Parrot===
:Sir Gideon Parrot (pronounced ''parroe'') is Hoch's humorous tribute to the  detectives of the Golden Age of mystery fiction, particularly [[Agatha Christie]]'s [[Hercule Poirot]] and [[John Dickson Carr]]'s Dr. [[Gideon Fell]].  These stories are gentle parodies of classic mystery devices, the ones so overused they have become cliches.

===Michael Vlado===
:Michael Vlado is the young king of a [[Romani (people)|Romany]] (Gypsy) tribe in contemporary eastern Europe.

===Alexander Swift===
:Alexander Swift, one of Hoch's more recent creations, is an intelligence agent for General [[George Washington]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  The stories comprise more nearly a serial than a series, as Swift probes ever deeper into rumors that the fort of [[West Point, New York|West Point]], commanded by General [[Benedict Arnold]], houses a traitor who will betray the fort to the British Army.  In the last Swift story, "Swift Among the Pirates", Swift travels to England, to discover Benedict Arnold is dead.

===Barney Hamet===
:Barney Hamet is a mystery writer who stumbles into real mysteries when he attends mystery conventions.  Hamet also featured in Hoch's 1969 novel ''The Shattered Raven''.

===Susan Holt===
:Susan Holt is a minor executive, in charge of promotions for a department store chain.

===Interpol===
:The [[Interpol]] stories are an apparently discontinued series from the 1970s and 1980s.  Interpol officers Sebastian Blue and Laura Charme investigated cases of international crime in Europe.

===Al Darlan===
:Al Darlan (originally Al ''Diamond''; Hoch decided to change the character's name after the earliest stories to avoid confusion with radio/TV detective ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective|Richard Diamond]]'') is a private investigator whose appearances have been sparse.  His last appearance was in the May 2008 issue of ''EQMM''.

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Elena Aiello''' (10 April 1895 – 19 June 1961) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Nun|professed religious]] and the founder of the Minim Sisters of the Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name=MC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysticsofthechurch.com/2011/09/blessed-elena-aiell-mystic-stigmatic.html|title=Blessed Elena Aiello – Mystic, Stigmatic &amp; Foundress|publisher=Mystics of the Church|date=|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aiello joined the [[Religious Sisters|Sisters]] of the Most Precious Blood but was forced to leave due to grave health that soon kept her confined to her home where she began experiencing visions of both [[Jesus Christ]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Madonna]] as well as saints such as [[Francis of Paola|Saint Francesco di Paola]].&lt;ref name=MU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montaltouffugo.net/elenaaiello.html|title=Blessed Elena Aiello|date=|publisher=Montalto Uffugo.net|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/91338|title=Blessed Elena Aiello|date=|publisher=Santi e Beati|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her beatification was celebrated on 14 September 2011.

==Life==
Elena Aiello was born on 10 April 1895 during [[Lent]] in [[Cosenza]] to Pasquale Aiello (22 February 1861 – 16 November 1955) – a tailor – and Tereseina Paglilla (d. 1905) as the third of eight children – one died aged one; she received her [[baptism]] from Father Francesco Benincasa on 15 April in the church of San Domenico as "Elena Emilia Santa Aiello" with her godmother being Maria Genise. During the Procession of Rogations her mother said if she had a daughter she would name her in honor of [[Helena (empress)|Saint Elena]].&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Her paternal grandparents were Francesco Antonio Maria Aiello (1833 – February 1902) and Teresa Nardi (29 November 1826–???); she had seven paternal aunts and uncles. The eldest sibling of hers was Emma (b. 1889) and so followed Fernando (b. 1892), Evangelina Isabella Rosina (b. 1896), Elisa Emilia Geltrude (b. 1898) and Ida (b. 1903) in addition to two others.&lt;ref name=MU/&gt;

Aiello made her [[First Communion]] on 21 June 1904 (the [[Passionist]] priest Timoteo presided) after a spiritual retreat in preparation for that and she and some other girls later obtained permission to wear a penitential belt. En route to receive the belt she had an accident that saw two front teeth lost but she put them in her handkerchief and continued on the path to receive it despite the pain.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Another occasion saw her inhale water from a glass she had in her hand while laughing and this caused a constant cough for over fourteen months at night and her voice volume decreased due to this; treatment made it worse. Aiello begged that the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Madonna]] heal her and she came to her in a vision at night and assured her that it would be so. Her mother died in 1905. She received her Confirmation aged eleven from Bishop Camillo Sorgente and her sponsor was Donna Agnesina Turano.&lt;ref name=MU/&gt;

Her desire to become a nun was stalled for her father asked her to stall this until a more appropriate time due to [[World War I]] which was raging in [[Europe]] at the time; she instead focused on aiding refugees and on impacted victims. On one occasion she met a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] named Alessandro and failed to persuade him to receive the sacraments; she continued to persuade him but he instead took a bottle and flung it at her which struck her neck that bled.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Aiello held a cloth to it and told him his soul was in danger and would not leave the room until he called for a priest to come in. Alessandro became so moved that he told her he'd receive the sacraments on the condition she continue to tend to him which she did for another three months.

In 1920 she joined the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood – her father directed her to that specific order for an unknown reason – but was later forced to leave that order due to a [[Necrosis|necrotic]] shoulder.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Aiello had her shoulder operated on without anesthetic while holding a small wooden cross and looking at a Marian image but the inept doctor cut nerves that caused her lockjaw and a vomiting spell for several weeks. Aiello could not partake in the vesting, for her superior saw her situation to be so bad she could not participate in it, thus forcing her departure. The doctor told her father to sue the order for her ailments (her shoulder now had [[gangrene]] setting in) but she convinced him not to do so.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Aiello also was diagnosed with [[stomach cancer]] and couldn't even retain liquefied food which prompted her doctor to deem her condition incurable – she placed her faith in [[Saint Rita]] for a cure which happened. These conditions were healed all of a sudden in 1921; Saint Rita herself appeared to Aiello in a dream one night.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Aiello began experiencing the [[stigmata]] each [[Good Friday]] from 1923 and this ended not long before her death. The first time this happened the Lord appeared in a white garment with the [[crown of thorns]] and placed it on her head prompting lots of blood to gush forth. The servant Rosaria was about to leave the house when she heard wailing and was petrified to see Aiello covered in blood believing someone murdered her. Rosaria rushed to get Aiello's relations who saw the blood but saw she was still alive and so contacted the doctor and several priests. The doctor attempted to halt the bleeding but could not do so for three hours.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; The nun also started experiencing visions of the Blessed Mother in 1947; she made predictions of future events following these visions. Aiello also experienced visions of [[Jesus Christ]] in addition to saints such as [[Francis of Paola|Saint Francesco di Paola]] and [[Saint Thérèse of Lisieux]]. On 28 January 1928 she founded a new religious order that she named the Minim Sisters of the Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name=MU/&gt; [[Pope Pius XII]] knew of Aiello and was the one who issued pontifical approval for the order in July 1949.

On 22 April 1940 the Lord told her to deliver a message to [[Benito Mussolini]] to tell him not to join [[Adolf Hitler]] during [[World War II]] for that would bring both terrible defeat and divine punishment; this plea was left ignored in the form of a letter she had sent on 6 May 1940.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt;

Aiello died at dawn at 6:19am on 19 June 1961 in [[Rome]]; she had received the Extreme Unction at 2:00am. Her remains were interred in the motherhouse of her order.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

==Beatification==
The beatification process opened on 7 January 1982 after the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] issued the official "[[nihil obstat]]" to the cause and titled Aiello as a [[Servant of God]]; the cognitional process was held in Cosenza from 15 April 1982 until its closure on 7 February 1987 after which point the C.C.S. validated the cause in Rome on 18 November 1988 while later receiving the [[Positio]] dossier from the postulation in 1989 for assessment. Theologians approved the cause on 5 December 1989 as did the C.C.S. on 8 May 1990 while the confirmation of her [[heroic virtue]] allowed for [[Pope John Paul II]] to title her as [[Venerable]] on 22 January 1991.

The process for the beatification miracle spanned from 4 October to 20 December 2005 and received validation from the C.C.S. on 24 February 2006 prior to medical experts approving the healing to be a legitimate miracle on 1 February 2007. Theologians also approved this on 23 October 2010 as did the C.C.S. on 18 January 2011. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] decreed the healing to be a miracle on 2 April 2011 and thus confirmed her beatification; Cardinal [[Angelo Amato]] presided over the celebration on the pope's behalf on 14 September 2011 in Cosenza.

The current [[postulator]] for this cause is Father Enzo Gabrieli.

In [[Pakistan]], [[Islamic culture]] is predominant but Pakistan also has [[cultural]] [[etiquette]] based mainly on [[South Asia]]n influence.
==Introduction and greeting==
*Combined-family system is usually liked but in these modern times, unit-family system prevails more than the former. Elders are respected heartily and get love and honour from youngsters, even if they are strangers and meeting each other for the very first time in any consequence.
*Guests are honoured delightfully and treated with love and respect. So, relatives, colleagues, friends and people from neighbourhood feel happy and cheerful to meet and stay connected with each other. Usually, in educated families, guests inform the host before their arrival so that someone's routine is not disturbed.
*Relatives, co-workers, neighbours, friends and mates stay united in every joy and sorrow and compete with each other in helping their friend in problem.
*Friendships are very strong and friends love each other without a reason and can do anything to make them laugh.

'''Gregorian chant''' is the central tradition of Western [[plainsong|plainchant]], a form of [[monophony|monophonic]], unaccompanied sacred song of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Gregorian chant developed mainly in western and central Europe during the 9th and 10th centuries, with later additions and redactions. Although popular legend credits [[Pope Gregory I]] with inventing Gregorian chant, scholars believe that it arose from a later [[Carolingian]] synthesis of [[Roman chant]] and [[Gallican chant]].

Gregorian chants were organized initially into four, then eight, and finally 12 [[musical mode|modes]]. Typical melodic features include a characteristic [[Ambitus (music)|ambitus]], and also characteristic intervallic patterns relative to a referential [[Final (music)|mode final]], [[incipit]]s and [[cadence (music)|cadences]], the use of [[reciting tone]]s at a particular distance from the final, around which the other notes of the melody revolve, and a vocabulary of musical motifs woven together through a process called [[centonization]] to create families of related chants. The scale patterns are organized against a background pattern formed of conjunct and disjunct [[tetrachord]]s, producing a larger pitch system called the [[Gamut (music)|gamut]]. The chants can be sung by using six-[[Note (music)|note]] patterns called [[hexachord]]s. Gregorian melodies are traditionally written using [[neume]]s, an early form of [[musical notation]] from which the modern [[staff (music)|four-line and five-line staff]] developed.&lt;ref&gt;Development of notation styles is discussed at [http://www.dolmetsch.com/musictheory2.htm Dolmetsch online], accessed 4&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;2006&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-voice elaborations of Gregorian chant, known as [[organum]], were an early stage in the development of Western [[polyphony]].

Gregorian chant was traditionally sung by [[choir]]s of men and boys in churches, or by men and women of [[religious order]]s in their chapels. It is the music of the [[Roman Rite]], performed in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the monastic [[Canonical hours|Office]]. Although Gregorian chant supplanted or marginalized the other indigenous plainchant traditions of the Christian West to become the official music of the Christian liturgy, [[Ambrosian chant]] still continues in use in Milan, and there are musicologists exploring both that and the [[Mozarabic chant]] of Christian Spain. Although Gregorian chant is no longer obligatory, the Roman Catholic Church still officially considers it the music most suitable for worship.&lt;ref name=Catholic&gt;[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/CDHN/v8.html The Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, Second Vatican Council] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121220134142/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/CDHN/v8.html |date=20 December 2012 }}; [[Pope Benedict XVI]]: [http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=44963 Catholic World News 28&amp;nbsp;June&amp;nbsp;2006] both accessed 5&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;2006&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, Gregorian chant underwent a musicological and popular resurgence.

==History==

===Development of earlier plainchant===
Singing has been part of the Christian [[liturgy]] since the earliest days of the Church. Until the mid-1990s, it was widely accepted that the [[psalms|psalmody]] of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Jewish]] worship significantly influenced and contributed to [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] ritual and chant. This view is no longer generally accepted by scholars, due to analysis that shows that most early Christian hymns did not have Psalms for texts, and that the Psalms were not sung in [[synagogue]]s for centuries after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Destruction of the Second Temple]] in AD&amp;nbsp;70.&lt;ref&gt;David Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' pp. 484–5.&lt;/ref&gt; However, early Christian rites did incorporate elements of Jewish worship that survived in later chant tradition. [[Canonical hours]] have their roots in Jewish prayer hours. "[[Amen]]" and "[[alleluia]]" come from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and the threefold "[[sanctus]]" derives from the threefold "kadosh" of the [[Kedushah]].&lt;ref&gt;Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Testament]] mentions singing hymns during the [[Last Supper]]: "When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the [[Mount of Olives]]" {{bibleverse||Matthew|26.30|NT}}. Other ancient witnesses such as [[Pope Clement I]], [[Tertullian]], [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St. Athanasius]], and [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]] confirm the practice,&lt;ref&gt;Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; although in poetic or obscure ways that shed little light on how music sounded during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' pp. 484–7 and James McKinnon, ''Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd-century Greek "[[Oxyrhynchus hymn]]" survived with musical notation, but the connection between this hymn and the plainchant tradition is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, James W.: "Christian Church, music of the early", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 11&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;2006), [http://www.grovemusic.com/ (subscription access)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical elements that would later be used in the Roman Rite began to appear in the 3rd century. The ''[[Apostolic Tradition]]'', attributed to the theologian [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], attests the singing of [[Hallel]] psalms with Alleluia as the refrain in early Christian [[agape feast|''agape'' feasts]].&lt;ref&gt;Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt; Chants of the Office, sung during the canonical hours, have their roots in the early 4th century, when desert monks following [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony]] introduced the practice of continuous psalmody, singing the complete cycle of 150 psalms each week. Around 375, [[antiphon]]al psalmody became popular in the Christian East; in 386, [[Ambrose|St. Ambrose]] introduced this practice to the West. In the fifth century, a singing school, the Schola Cantorum, was founded at Rome to provide training in church musicianship.&lt;ref&gt;Grout, ''A History of Western Music'', pp. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars are still debating how plainchant developed during the 5th through the 9th centuries, as information from this period is scarce. Around 410, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] described the [[responsory|responsorial]] singing of a [[Gradual]] psalm at Mass. At c. 520, [[Benedict of Nursia]] established what is called the rule of St. Benedict, in which the protocol of the Divine Office for monastic use was laid down. Around 678, Roman chant was taught at [[York]].&lt;ref&gt;James McKinnon, ''Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctive regional traditions of Western plainchant arose during this period, notably in the British Isles ([[Celtic chant]]), Spain (Mozarabic), Gaul (Gallican), and Italy ([[Old Roman chant|Old Roman]], Ambrosian and [[Beneventan chant|Beneventan]]). These traditions may have evolved from a hypothetical year-round repertory of 5th-century plainchant after the western [[Roman Empire]] collapsed.

[[Johannes Hymonides|John the Deacon]], biographer (c. 872) of [[Pope Gregory I]], modestly claimed that the saint "compiled a patchwork antiphonary",&lt;ref name=Bewerunge&gt;{{Cite CE1913|last=Bewerunge |first=Heinrich |wstitle=Gregorian chant}}&lt;/ref&gt; unsurprisingly, given his considerable work with liturgical development. He reorganized the Schola Cantorum and established a more uniform standard in church services, gathering chants from among the regional traditions as widely as he could manage. Of those, he retained what he could, revised where necessary, and assigned particular chants to the various services.&lt;ref&gt;Grout, ''A History of Western Music'', pp. 28–9&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Donald Jay Grout]], his goal was to organize the bodies of chants from diverse traditions into a uniform and orderly whole for use by the entire western region of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Grout, ''A History of Western Music'', p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; His renowned love for music was recorded only 34 years after his death; the epitaph of Honorius testified that comparison to Gregory was already considered the highest praise for a music-loving pope.&lt;ref name=Bewerunge /&gt; While later legends magnified his real achievements, these significant steps may account for why his name came to be attached to Gregorian chant.

===Origins of mature plainchant===

The Gregorian repertory was further systematized for use in the [[Roman Rite]], and scholars weigh the relative influences of Roman and [[Carolingian]] practices upon the development of plainchant. The late 8th century saw a steadily increasing influence of the Carolingian monarchs over the popes. During a visit to Gaul in 752–753, [[Pope Stephen II]] celebrated [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] using Roman chant. According to [[Charlemagne]], his father [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] abolished the local [[Gallican Rite]]s in favor of the Roman use, in order to strengthen ties with Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty years later (785–786), at Charlemagne's request, [[Pope Adrian I]] sent a papal [[sacramentary]] with Roman chants to the Carolingian court. According to [[James McKinnon]], over a brief period in the 8th century, a project overseen by [[Chrodegang of Metz]] in the favorable atmosphere of the Carolingian monarchs, also compiled the core liturgy of the Roman Mass and promoted its use in [[Franks|Francia]] and throughout Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Grove Music Online]]|last=Kenneth|first=Levy|display-authors=etal|chapter=Plainchant, §2: History to the 10th century|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willi Apel]] and Robert Snow assert a scholarly consensus that Gregorian chant developed around 750 from a synthesis of Roman and Gallican chants, and was commissioned by the Carolingian rulers in France. Andreas Pfisterer and Peter Jeffery have shown that older melodic essentials from Roman chant are clear in the synthesized chant repertory. There were other developments as well. Chants were modified, influenced by local styles and Gallican chant, and fitted into the theory of the ancient Greek [[octoechos]] system of modes in a manner that created what later came to be known as the western system of the eight [[musical mode|church modes]]. The Metz project also invented an innovative [[musical notation]], using freeform [[neume]]s to show the shape of a remembered melody.&lt;ref&gt;Grier J. (2003) Ademar de Chabannes, Carolingian Musical Practices, and Nota Romana. Journal of the American Musicological Society. 56 (1):43–98.&lt;/ref&gt; This notation was further developed over time, culminating in the introduction of [[Staff (music)|staff]] lines (attributed to [[Guido d'Arezzo]]) in the early 11th century, what we know today as plainchant notation. The whole body of Frankish-Roman Carolingian chant, augmented with new chants to complete the liturgical year, coalesced into a single body of chant that was called "Gregorian."

The changes made in the new system of chants were so significant that they have led some scholars to speculate that it was named in honor of the contemporary [[Pope Gregory II]].&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, ''Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the lore surrounding [[Pope Gregory I]] was sufficient to culminate in his portrayal as the actual author of Gregorian Chant. He was often depicted as receiving the dictation of plainchant from a dove representing the [[Holy Spirit]], thus giving Gregorian chant the stamp of being divinely inspired. Scholars agree that the melodic content of much Gregorian Chant did not exist in that form in Gregory I's day. In addition, it is known definitively that the familiar neumatic system for notating plainchant had not been established in his time.&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, Richard ''The Oxford History of Western Music, Volume I – Music from the earliest notations to the 16th century'' Chapter 1, the curtain goes up, page 6. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Gregory's authorship is popularly accepted by some as fact to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissemination and hegemony===
Gregorian chant appeared in a remarkably uniform state across Europe within a short time. [[Charlemagne]], once elevated to [[Holy Roman Emperor]], aggressively spread Gregorian chant throughout his empire to consolidate religious and secular power, requiring the clergy to use the new repertory on pain of death.&lt;ref&gt;David Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; From English and German sources, Gregorian chant spread north to [[Scandinavia]], [[Iceland]] and [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 604.&lt;/ref&gt; In 885, [[Pope Stephen V]] banned the [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]] liturgy, leading to the ascendancy of Gregorian chant in Eastern Catholic lands including [[Poland]], [[Moravia]] and [[Slovakia]].

The other plainchant repertories of the Christian West faced severe competition from the new Gregorian chant. Charlemagne continued his father's policy of favoring the Roman Rite over the local Gallican traditions. By the 9th century the Gallican rite and chant had effectively been eliminated, although not without local resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gregorian chant of the [[Sarum Rite]] displaced [[Celtic chant]]. Gregorian coexisted with Beneventan chant for over a century before Beneventan chant was abolished by papal decree (1058). Mozarabic chant survived the influx of the [[Visigoths]] and [[Moors]], but not the Roman-backed prelates newly installed in Spain during the [[Reconquista]]. Restricted to a handful of dedicated chapels, modern Mozarabic chant is highly Gregorianized and bears no musical resemblance to its original form. Ambrosian chant alone survived to the present day, preserved in [[Milan]] due to the musical reputation and ecclesiastical authority of [[Ambrose|St. Ambrose]].

Gregorian chant eventually replaced the local chant tradition of Rome itself, which is now known as Old Roman chant. In the 10th century, virtually no musical manuscripts were being notated in Italy. Instead, Roman Popes imported Gregorian chant from (German) Holy Roman Emperors during the 10th and 11th centuries. For example, the [[Credo]] was added to the [[Roman Rite]] at the behest of the Emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] in 1014.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Reinforced by the legend of Pope Gregory, Gregorian chant was taken to be the authentic, original chant of Rome, a misconception that continues to this day. By the 12th and 13th centuries, Gregorian chant had supplanted or marginalized all the other Western plainchant traditions.

Later sources of these other chant traditions show an increasing Gregorian influence, such as occasional efforts to categorize their chants into the Gregorian [[musical mode|modes]]. Similarly, the Gregorian repertory incorporated elements of these lost plainchant traditions, which can be identified by careful stylistic and historical analysis. For example, the ''[[Improperia]]'' of [[Good Friday]] are believed to be a remnant of the Gallican repertory.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Parrish, "A Treasury of Early Music" pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early sources and later revisions===
[[File:Ad te levavi trimmed.jpg|thumb|right|Two plainchants from the Mass Proper, written in adiastematic neumes, from St. Gallen, MS 359]]
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Gradual chant - Universi qui te expectant.ogg|title=''Universi qui te expectant'', Gradual for the Mass (first Sunday of Advent)|description=This chant corresponds to the second one on the manuscript folio above beneath the large rubric ''Responsorium Graduale''; by [[Schola Antiqua of Chicago]].}}
The first extant sources with musical notation were written around 930 (Graduale Laon). Before this, plainchant had been transmitted orally. Most scholars of Gregorian chant agree that the development of music notation assisted the dissemination of chant across Europe. The earlier notated manuscripts are primarily from [[Regensburg]] in Germany, [[Abbey of Saint Gall|St. Gall]] in Switzerland, [[Laon]] and [[Abbey of Saint Martial, Limoges|St. Martial]] in France.

Gregorian chant has in its long history been subjected to a series of redactions to bring it up to changing contemporary tastes and practice. The more recent redaction undertaken in the Benedictine Abbey of St. Pierre, Solesmes, has turned into a huge undertaking to restore the allegedly corrupted chant to a hypothetical "original" state. Early Gregorian chant was revised to conform to the theoretical structure of the [[musical mode|modes]]. In 1562–63, the [[Council of Trent]] banned most [[sequence (poetry)|sequences]]. Guidette's ''Directorium chori'', published in 1582, and the ''Editio medicea'', published in 1614, drastically revised what was perceived as corrupt and flawed "barbarism" by making the chants conform to contemporary aesthetic standards.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 288–289.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1811, the French musicologist [[Alexandre-Étienne Choron]], as part of a conservative backlash following the liberal Catholic orders' inefficacy during the [[French Revolution]], called for returning to the "purer" Gregorian chant of Rome over French corruptions.&lt;ref&gt;Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 622.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, early liturgical and musical manuscripts were unearthed and edited. Earlier, Dom [[Prosper Guéranger]] revived the monastic tradition in Solesmes. Re-establishing the Divine Office was among his priorities, but no proper chantbooks existed. Many monks were sent out to libraries throughout Europe to find relevant Chant manuscripts. In 1871, however, the old Medicea edition was reprinted ([[Pustet]], Regensburg) which [[Pope Pius IX]] declared the only official version. In their firm belief that they were on the right way, Solesmes increased its efforts. In 1889, after decades of research, the monks of [[Solesmes Abbey|Solesmes]] released the first book in a planned series, the Paléographie Musicale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/palographiemusic15macq|title=Paléographie musicale : fac-similés phototypiques des principaux manuscrits de chant grégorien, ambrosien, mozarabe, gallican|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incentive of its publication was to demonstrate the corruption of the 'Medicea' by presenting photographed notations originating from a great variety of manuscripts of one single chant, which Solesmes called forth as witnesses to assert their own reforms.

The monks of Solesmes brought in their heaviest artillery in this battle, as indeed the academically sound 'Paleo' was intended to be a war-tank, meant to abolish once and for all the corrupted Pustet edition. On the evidence of congruence throughout various manuscripts (which were duly published in [[facsimile]] editions with ample editorial introductions) Solesmes was able to work out a practical reconstruction. This reconstructed chant was academically praised, but rejected by Rome until 1903, when [[Pope Leo XIII]] died. His successor, [[Pope Pius X]], promptly accepted the Solesmes chant – now compiled as the ''[[Liber Usualis]]'' – as authoritative. In 1904, the Vatican edition of the Solesmes chant was commissioned. Serious academic debates arose, primarily owing to stylistic liberties taken by the Solesmes editors to impose their controversial interpretation of rhythm. The Solesmes editions insert [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] marks and note-lengthening ''episema'' and ''mora'' marks not found in the original sources.

Conversely, they omit significative letters found in the original sources, which give instructions for rhythm and articulation such as speeding up or slowing down. These editorial practices has placed the historical authenticity of the Solesmes interpretation in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 624–627.&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since restoration of Chant was taken up in Solesmes, there have been lengthy discussions of exactly what course was to be taken. Some favored a strict academic rigour and wanted to postpone publications, while others concentrated on practical matters and wanted to supplant the corrupted tradition as soon as possible. Roughly a century later, there still exists a breach between a strict musicological approach and the practical needs of church choirs. Thus the performance tradition officially promulgated since the onset of the Solesmes restoration is substantially at odds with musicological evidence.

In his [[motu proprio]] ''[[Tra le sollecitudini]]'', Pius X mandated the use of Gregorian chant, encouraging the faithful to sing the [[Ordinary of the Mass]], although he reserved the singing of the [[proper (liturgy)|Propers]] for males. While this custom is maintained in [[traditionalist Catholic]] communities (most of which allow all-female scholas as well, though), the Catholic Church no longer persists with this ban. [[Vatican II]] officially allowed worshipers to substitute other music, particularly sacred polyphony, in place of Gregorian chant, although it did reaffirm that Gregorian chant was still the official music of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, and the music most suitable for worship in the Roman Liturgy.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

==Musical form==

===Melodic types===
Gregorian chant is, as 'chant' implies, vocal music. The text, the phrases, words and eventually the syllables, can be sung in various ways. The most straightforward is recitation on the same tone, which is called "syllabic" as each syllable is sung to a single tone. Likewise, simple chants are often syllabic throughout with only a few instances where two or more notes are sung on one syllable. "Neumatic" chants are more embellished and [[ligature (music)|ligatures]], a connected group of notes, written as a single compound neume, abound in the text. [[Melisma]]tic chants are the most ornate chants in which elaborate melodies are sung on long sustained vowels as in the Alleluia, ranging from five or six notes per syllable to over sixty in the more prolix melismata.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' pp. 85–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Epistle for the Solemn Mass of Easter Day.ogg|title=Epistle for the Solemn Mass of Easter Day|description=Example of liturgical recitative in Gregorian chant}}
Gregorian chants fall into two broad categories of melody: [[recitative]]s and free melodies.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest kind of melody is the liturgical recitative. Recitative melodies are dominated by a single pitch, called the ''[[reciting tone]]''. Other pitches appear in melodic formulae for [[incipit]]s, partial [[cadence (music)|cadences]], and full cadences. These chants are primarily syllabic. For example, the [[Collect]] for [[Easter]] consists of 127 syllables sung to 131 pitches, with 108 of these pitches being the reciting note A and the other 23 pitches flexing down to G.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppin, ''Anthology of Medieval Music'' p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Liturgical recitatives are commonly found in the [[Accentus Ecclesiasticus|accentus]] chants of the liturgy, such as the intonations of the Collect, [[Epistle]], and [[Gospel]] during the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and in the direct [[psalmody]] of the [[Canonical hours|Office]].

Psalmodic chants, which intone [[psalms]], include both recitatives and free melodies. Psalmodic chants include ''direct psalmody'', ''antiphonal chants'', and ''responsorial chants''.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; In direct psalmody, psalm verses are sung without refrains to simple, formulaic tones. Most psalmodic chants are antiphonal and responsorial, sung to free melodies of varying complexity.

Antiphonal chants such as the [[Introit]], and [[Communion (chant)|Communion]] originally referred to chants in which two choirs sang in alternation, one choir singing verses of a psalm, the other singing a refrain called an ''[[antiphon]]''. Over time, the verses were reduced in number, usually to just one psalm verse and the [[doxology]], or even omitted entirely. Antiphonal chants reflect their ancient origins as elaborate recitatives through the reciting tones in their melodies. Ordinary chants, such as the [[Kyrie]] and [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]], are not considered antiphonal chants, although they are often performed in antiphonal style.

Responsorial chants such as the [[Gradual]], [[Alleluia]], [[Offertory]], and the Office Responsories originally consisted of a refrain called a ''respond'' sung by a choir, alternating with psalm verses sung by a soloist. [[Responsory|Responsorial]] chants are often composed of an amalgamation of various stock musical phrases, pieced together in a practice called ''[[centonization]]''. Tracts are melismatic settings of psalm verses and use frequent recurring cadences and they are strongly centonized.

Gregorian chant evolved to fulfill various functions in the Roman Catholic liturgy. Broadly speaking, liturgical recitatives are used for texts intoned by deacons or priests. Antiphonal chants accompany liturgical actions: the entrance of the officiant, the collection of offerings, and the distribution of sanctified bread and wine. Responsorial chants expand on readings and lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-psalmodic chants, including the [[Ordinary of the Mass]], [[Sequence (poetry)|sequences]], and [[hymn]]s, were originally intended for congregational singing.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of their texts largely defines their musical style. In sequences, the same melodic phrase is repeated in each couplet. The strophic texts of hymns use the same syllabic melody for each stanza.

===Modality===
{{Main|Musical mode}}
Early plainchant, like much of Western music, is believed to have been distinguished by the use of the [[diatonic scale]]. Modal theory, which postdates the composition of the core chant repertory, arises from a synthesis of two very different traditions: the speculative tradition of numerical ratios and species inherited from ancient Greece and a second tradition rooted in the practical art of cantus. The earliest writings that deal with both theory and practice include the [[Musica enchiriadis|Enchiriadis]] group of treatises, which circulated in the late ninth century and possibly have their roots in an earlier, oral tradition. In contrast to the ancient Greek system of tetrachords (a collection of four continuous notes) that descend by two tones and a semitone, the Enchiriadis writings base their tone-system on a tetrachord that corresponds to the four finals of chant, D, E, F, and G. The disjunct tetrachords in the Enchiriadis system have been the subject of much speculation, because they do not correspond to the diatonic framework that became the standard Medieval scale (for example, there is a high F#, a note not recognized by later Medieval writers). A diatonic scale with a chromatically alterable b/b-flat was first described by [[Hucbald]], who adopted the tetrachord of the finals (D, E, F, G) and constructed the rest of the system following the model of the Greek Greater and Lesser Perfect Systems. These were the first steps in forging a theoretical tradition that corresponded to chant.

Around 1025, [[Guido d'Arezzo]] revolutionized Western music with the development of the ''gamut'', in which pitches in the singing range were organized into overlapping [[hexachord]]s. Hexachords could be built on C (the natural hexachord, C-D-E^F-G-A), F (the soft hexachord, using a B-flat, F-G-A^Bb-C-D), or G (the hard hexachord, using a B-natural, G-A-B^C-D-E). The B-flat was an integral part of the system of hexachords rather than an [[accidental (music)|accidental]]. The use of notes outside of this collection was described as [[musica ficta]].

Gregorian chant was categorized into eight [[musical mode|modes]], influenced by the eightfold division of Byzantine chants called the ''[[oktoechos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Each mode is distinguished by its ''final'', ''dominant'', and ''ambitus''. The ''final'' is the ending note, which is usually an important note in the overall structure of the melody. The ''dominant'' is a secondary pitch that usually serves as a [[reciting tone]] in the melody. ''[[Ambitus (music)|Ambitus]]'' refers to the range of pitches used in the melody. Melodies whose final is in the middle of the ambitus, or which have only a limited ambitus, are categorized as ''plagal'', while melodies whose final is in the lower end of the ambitus and have a range of over five or six notes are categorized as ''authentic''. Although corresponding plagal and authentic modes have the same final, they have different dominants.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' pp. 64–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The existent pseudo-Greek names of the modes, rarely used in medieval times, derive from a misunderstanding of the Ancient Greek modes; the prefix "[[wikt:hypo-|hypo-]]" (under, Gr.) indicates a plagal mode, where the melody moves below the final. In contemporary Latin manuscripts the modes are simply called Protus authentus /plagalis, Deuterus, Tritus and Tetrardus: the 1st mode, authentic or plagal, the 2nd mode etc. In the Roman Chantbooks the modes are indicated by Roman numerals.

:Modes 1 and 2 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on D, sometimes called [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] and [[Hypodorian mode|Hypodorian]].
:Modes 3 and 4 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on E, sometimes called [[Phrygian mode|Phrygian]] and [[Hypophrygian mode|Hypophrygian]].
:Modes 5 and 6 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on F, sometimes called [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] and [[Hypolydian mode|Hypolydian]].
:Modes 7 and 8 are the authentic and plagal modes ending on G, sometimes called [[Mixolydian mode|Mixolydian]] and [[Hypomixolydian mode|Hypomixolydian]].

Although the modes with melodies ending on A, B, and C are sometimes referred to as [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]], [[Locrian mode|Locrian]], and [[Ionian mode|Ionian]], these are not considered distinct modes and are treated as [[Transposition (music)|transpositions]] of whichever mode uses the same set of hexachords. The actual pitch of the Gregorian chant is not fixed, so the piece can be sung in whichever range is most comfortable.

Certain classes of Gregorian chant have a separate musical formula for each mode, allowing one section of the chant to transition smoothly into the next section, such as the [[psalm verse]]s that are sung between the repetition of antiphons, or the Gloria Patri. Thus we find models for the recitation of psalmverses, Alleluia and Gloria Patri for all eight modes.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not every Gregorian chant fits neatly into Guido's hexachords or into the system of eight modes. For example, there are chants — especially from German sources – whose [[neume]]s suggest a warbling of pitches between the notes E and F, outside the hexachord system, or in other words, employing a form of chromatism.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Gregorian chant, like Ambrosian and Old Roman chant, whose melodies are most closely related to Gregorian, did not use the modal system.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 166–78, and Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; The great need for a system of organizing chants lies in the need to link antiphons with standard tones, as in for example, the psalmody at the Office. Using Psalm Tone i with an antiphon in Mode 1 makes for a smooth transition between the end of the antiphon and the intonation of the tone, and the ending of the tone can then be chosen to provide a smooth transition back to the antiphon. As the modal system gained acceptance, Gregorian chants were edited to conform to the modes, especially during 12th-century [[Cistercian]] reforms. Finals were altered, melodic ranges reduced, melismata trimmed, B-flats eliminated, and repeated words removed.&lt;ref&gt;Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' pp. 608–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these attempts to impose modal consistency, some chants — notably Communions — defy simple modal assignment. For example, in four medieval manuscripts, the Communion ''Circuibo'' was transcribed using a different mode in each.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 171–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical idiom===
Several features besides modality contribute to the musical idiom of Gregorian chant, giving it a distinctive musical flavor. Melodic motion is primarily [[steps and skips|stepwise]]. Skips of a third are common, and larger skips far more common than in other plainchant repertories such as Ambrosian chant or Beneventan chant. Gregorian melodies are more likely to traverse a seventh than a full octave, so that melodies rarely travel from D up to the D an octave higher, but often travel from D to the C a seventh higher, using such patterns as D-F-G-A-C.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 256–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregorian melodies often explore chains of pitches, such as F-A-C, around which the other notes of the chant gravitate.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Music of the Middle Ages'' p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Within each mode, certain incipits and cadences are preferred, which the modal theory alone does not explain. Chants often display complex internal structures that combine and repeat musical subphrases. This occurs notably in the [[Offertory|Offertories]]; in chants with shorter, repeating texts such as the [[Kyrie]] and [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]]; and in longer chants with clear textual divisions such as the Great Responsories, the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]], and the [[Credo]].&lt;ref&gt;Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 258–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chants sometimes fall into melodically related groups. The musical phrases [[centonization|centonized]] to create [[Gradual]]s and [[Tract (liturgy)|Tracts]] follow a musical "grammar" of sorts. Certain phrases are used only at the beginnings of chants, or only at the end, or only in certain combinations, creating musical families of chants such as the ''[[Iustus ut palma]]'' family of Graduals.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' pp. 344–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Introit]]s in mode 3, including ''Loquetur Dominus'' above, exhibit melodic similarities. Mode III (E authentic) chants have C as a dominant, so C is the expected reciting tone. These mode III Introits, however, use both G and C as reciting tones, and often begin with a decorated leap from G to C to establish this tonality.&lt;ref&gt;Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' pp. 110–113.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar examples exist throughout the repertory.

===Notation===
[[File:Neume2.jpg|thumb|Offertory ''Iubilate deo universa terra'' in unheightened neume]]

The earliest notated sources of Gregorian chant (written ca. 950) used symbols called ''[[neume]]s'' (Gr. sign, of the hand) to indicate tone-movements and relative duration within each syllable. A sort of musical stenography that seems to focus on gestures and tone-movements but not the specific pitches of individual notes, nor the relative starting pitches of each neume. Given the fact that Chant was learned in an oral tradition in which the texts and melodies were sung from memory, this was obviously not necessary. The neumatic manuscripts display great sophistication and precision in notation and a wealth of graphic signs to indicate the musical gesture and proper pronunciation of the text.
Scholars postulate that this practice may have been derived from [[cheironomy|cheironomic]] hand-gestures, the [[ekphonetic]] notation of [[Byzantine chant]], punctuation marks, or diacritical accents.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Kenneth: "Plainchant", ''Grove Music Online'', ed. L. Macy (Accessed 20&amp;nbsp;January&amp;nbsp;2006), [http://www.grovemusic.com/shared/views/article.html?section=music.40099.2.3#music.40099.2.3 (subscription access)]&lt;/ref&gt; Later adaptations and innovations included the use of a dry-scratched line or an inked line or two lines, marked C or F showing the relative pitches between neumes. Consistent relative heightening first developed in the Aquitaine region, particularly at [[Saint Martial|St. Martial de Limoges]], in the first half of the eleventh century. Many German-speaking areas, however, continued to use unpitched neumes into the twelfth century. Additional symbols developed, such as the ''custos'', placed at the end of a system to show the next pitch. Other symbols indicated changes in articulation, duration, or tempo, such as a letter "t" to indicate a [[tenuto]]. Another form of early notation used a system of letters corresponding to different pitches, much as [[Shaker music]] is notated.

[[File:gregorian chant.gif|frame|''Liber usualis'' in square notation (excerpt from the ''Kyrie eleison (Orbis factor)'')]]
By the 13th century, the neumes of Gregorian chant were usually written in ''square notation'' on a four-line staff with a clef, as in the ''Graduale Aboense'' pictured above. In square notation, small groups of ascending notes on a syllable are shown as stacked squares, read from bottom to top, while descending notes are written with diamonds read from left to right. When a syllable has a large number of notes, a series of smaller such groups of neumes are written in succession, read from left to right. The oriscus, quilisma, and liquescent neumes indicate special vocal treatments, that have been largely neglected due to uncertainty as to how to sing them. Since the 1970s, with the influential insights of Dom [[Eugène Cardine]] (see below under 'rhythm'), ornamental neumes have received more attention from both researchers and performers.
B-flat is indicated by a "b-mollum" (Lat. soft), a rounded undercaste 'b' placed to the left of the entire neume in which the note occurs, as shown in the "Kyrie" to the right. When necessary, a "b-durum" (Lat. hard), written squarely, indicates B-natural and serves to cancel the b-mollum. This system of square notation is standard in modern chantbooks.

==Performance==

===Texture===
Gregorian chant was originally used for singing the [[Canonical hours|Office]] (by male and female religious) and for singing the parts of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] pertaining to the lay faithful (male and female), the celebrant (priest, always male) and the choir (composed of male ordained clergy, except in convents). Outside the larger cities, the number of available clergy dropped, and lay men started singing these parts. The choir was considered an official liturgical duty reserved to clergy, so women were not allowed to sing in the ''[[Schola Cantorum (disambiguation)|Schola Cantorum]]'' or other choirs except in [[convent]]s where women were permitted to sing the Office and the parts of the Mass pertaining to the choir as a function of their consecrated life.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Neuls-Bates, ''Women in Music'' p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chant was normally sung in unison. Later innovations included ''[[Trope (music)|tropes]]'', which is a new text sung to the same melodic phrases in a melismatic chant (repeating an entire Alleluia-melody on a new text for instance, or repeating a full phrase with a new text that comments on the previously sung text) and various forms of ''[[organum]]'', (improvised) harmonic embellishment of chant melodies focusing on octaves, fifths, fourths, and, later, thirds. Neither tropes nor organum, however, belong to the chant repertory proper. The main exception to this is the sequence, whose origins lay in troping the extended [[melisma]] of [[Alleluia]] chants known as the [[jubilus]], but the sequences, like the tropes, were later officially suppressed. The [[Council of Trent]] struck sequences from the Gregorian corpus, except those for [[Easter]], [[Pentecost]], [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] and [[All Souls' Day]].

Not much is known about the particular vocal stylings or performance practices used for Gregorian chant in the Middle Ages. On occasion, the clergy was urged to have their singers perform with more restraint and piety. This suggests that virtuosic performances occurred, contrary to the modern stereotype of Gregorian chant as slow-moving mood music. This tension between musicality and piety goes far back; [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] himself criticized the practice of promoting clerics based on their charming singing rather than their preaching.&lt;ref&gt;Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Odo of Cluny]], a renowned monastic reformer, praised the intellectual and musical virtuosity to be found in chant:

{{quote|For in these [Offertories and Communions] there are the most varied kinds of ascent, descent, repeat..., delight for the ''cognoscenti'', difficulty for the beginners, and an admirable organization... that widely differs from other chants; they are not so much made according to the rules of music... but rather evince the authority and validity... of music.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

True antiphonal performance by two alternating choruses still occurs, as in certain German monasteries. However, antiphonal chants are generally performed in responsorial style by a solo cantor alternating with a chorus. This practice appears to have begun in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Another medieval innovation had the solo cantor sing the opening words of responsorial chants, with the full chorus finishing the end of the opening phrase. This innovation allowed the soloist to fix the pitch of the chant for the chorus and to cue the choral entrance.

===Rhythm===
Given the oral teaching tradition of Gregorian chant, modern reconstruction of intended rhythm from the written notation of Gregorian chant has always been a source of debate among modern scholars. To complicate matters further, many ornamental neumes used in the earliest manuscripts pose difficulties on the interpretation of rhythm. Certain neumes such as the ''pressus'', pes quassus, strophic neumes may indicate repeated notes, lengthening by repercussion, in some cases with added ornaments. By the 13th century, with the widespread use of square notation, most chant was sung with an approximately equal duration allotted to each note, although [[Jerome of Moravia]] cites exceptions in which certain notes, such as the final notes of a chant, are lengthened.&lt;ref&gt;Hiley, "Chant", ''Performance Practice: Music before 1600'' p. 44. "The performance of chant in equal note lengths from the 13th century onwards is well supported by contemporary statements."&lt;/ref&gt;

While the standard repertory of Gregorian Chant was partly being supplanted with new forms of polyphony, the earlier melo-rhythmic refinements of monophonic chant seem to fall into disuse. Later redactions such as the ''Editio medicaea'' of 1614 rewrote chant so that melismata, with their melodic accent, fell on accented syllables.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; This aesthetic held sway until the re-examination of chant in the late 19th century by such scholars as Wagner, [[Joseph Pothier|Pothier]], and [[André Mocquereau|Mocquereau]], who fell into two camps.

One school of thought, including Wagner, Jammers, and Lipphardt, advocated imposing rhythmic meters on chants, although they disagreed on how that should be done. An opposing interpretation, represented by Pothier and Mocquereau, supported a free rhythm of equal note values, although some notes are lengthened for textual emphasis or musical effect. The modern Solesmes editions of Gregorian chant follow this interpretation. Mocquereau divided melodies into two- and three-note phrases, each beginning with an ''ictus'', akin to a beat, notated in chantbooks as a small vertical mark. These basic melodic units combined into larger phrases through a complex system expressed by [[cheironomy|cheironomic]] hand-gestures.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach prevailed during the twentieth century, propagated by [[Justine Ward]]'s program of music education for children, until the liturgical role of chant was diminished after the liturgical reforms of [[Paul VI]], and new scholarship "essentially discredited" Mocquereau's rhythmic theories.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, Joseph: "Roman Catholic Church Music", Section VI.1, [http://www.grovemusic.com/ Grove Music Online] ed. L. Macy (Accessed 28&amp;nbsp;June&amp;nbsp;2006), (subscription access)&lt;/ref&gt;

Common modern practice favors performing Gregorian chant with no beat or regular metric accent, largely for aesthetic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;William P. Mahrt, "Chant", ''A Performer's Guide to Medieval Music'' p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The text determines the accent while the melodic contour determines the [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]]. The note lengthenings recommended by the Solesmes school remain influential, though not prescriptive.

Dom Eugene Cardine, (1905–1988) monk from Solesmes, published his 'Semiologie Gregorienne' in 1970 in which he clearly explains the musical significance of the neumes of the early chant manuscripts. Cardine shows the great diversity of neumes and graphic variations of the basic shape of a particular neume, which can not be expressed in the square notation. This variety in notation must have served a practical purpose and therefore a musical significance. Nine years later, the Graduale Triplex was published, in which the Roman Gradual, containing all the chants for Mass in a Year's cycle, appeared with the neumes of the two most important manuscripts copied under and over the 4-line staff of the square notation. The Graduale Triplex made widely accessible the original notation of Sankt Gallen and Laon (compiled after 930 AD) in a single chantbook and was a huge step forward. Dom Cardine had many students who have each in their own way continued their semiological studies, some of whom also started experimenting in applying the newly understood principles in performance practice.

The studies of Cardine and his students (Godehard Joppich, Luigi Augustoni, Johannes B. Göschl, Marie-Noël Colette, Rupert Fischer, Marie-Claire Billecocq, [[Alexander M. Schweitzer]] to name a few) have clearly demonstrated that rhythm in Gregorian chant as notated in the 10th century rhythmic manuscripts (notably Skt. Gallen and Laon) manifest such rhythmic diversity and melodic – rhythmic ornamentations for which there is hardly a living performance tradition in the Western world. Contemporary groups that endeavour to sing according to the manuscript traditions have evolved after 1975. Some practising researchers favour a closer look at non Western (liturgical) traditions, in such cultures where the tradition of modal monophony was never abandoned.

Another group with different views are the mensuralists or the proportionalists, who maintain that rhythm has to be interpreted proportionately, where shorts are exactly half the longs. This school of interpretation claims the support of historical authorities such as St Augustine, Remigius, Guido and Aribo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calumcille.com/griogair/9A14.html |title=The symbolism of chant rhythm |publisher=Calumcille.com |accessdate=2012-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315074741/http://www.calumcille.com/griogair/9A14.html |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is advocated by John Blackley and his 'Schola Antiqua New York'.

Recent research in the Netherlands by Dr. Dirk van Kampen has indicated that the authentic rhythm of Gregorian chant in the 10th century includes both proportional elements and elements that are in agreement with semiology.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk van Kampen (1994). ''Het oorspronkelijke ritme van het Gregoriaans: Een 'semiologisch-mensuralistische' studie''. Landsmeer, {{ISBN|90-900742-8-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dirk van Kampen (2005). Uitgangspunten voor de ritmiek van Gregoriaans. ''Tijdschrift voor Gregoriaans'', 30, 89–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the expectation that the rhythm of Gregorian chant (and thus the duration of the individual notes) anyway adds to the expressivity of the sacred Latin texts, several word-related variables were studied for their relationship with several neume-related variables, exploring these relationships in a sample of introit chants using such statistical methods as correlational analysis and multiple regression analysis.

Beside the length of the syllables (measured in tenths of seconds), each text syllable was evaluated in terms of its position within the word to which it belongs, defining such variables as "the syllable has or has not the main accent", "the syllable is or is not at the end of a word", etc., and in terms of the particular sounds produced (for instance, the syllable contains the vowel "i"). The various neume elements were evaluated by attaching different duration values to them, both in terms of semiological propositions (nuanced durations according to the manner of neume writing in Chris Hakkennes’ Graduale Lagal&lt;ref&gt;Chris Hakkennes (1984). ''Graduale Lagal''. Den Haag: Stichting Centrum voor de Kerkzang.&lt;/ref&gt;), and in terms of fixed duration values that were based on mensuralistic notions, however with ratios between short and long notes ranging from 1 : 1, via 1 : 1.2, 1 : 1.4, etc. to 1 : 3. To distinguish short and long notes, tables were consulted that were established by Van Kampen in an unpublished comparative study regarding the neume notations according to St Gallen and Laon codices. With some exceptions, these tables confirm the short vs. long distinctions in Cardine’s 'Semiologie Gregorienne'.

The lengths of the neumes were given values by adding up the duration values for the separate neume elements, each time following a particular hypothesis concerning the rhythm of Gregoriant chant. Both the syllable lengths and the neume lengths were also expressed in relation to the total duration of the syllables, resp. neumes for a word (contextual variables). Correlating the various word and neume variables, substantial correlations were found for the word variables 'accented syllable' and 'contextual syllable duration'. Moreover, it could be established that the multiple correlation (''R'') between the two types of variables reaches its maximum (''R'' is about 0.80) if the neumatic elements are evaluated according to the following rules of duration: (a) neume elements that represent short notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 1 time; (b) neume elements that represent long notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 2 times; (c) neumes consisting of only one note are characterized by flexible duration values (with an average value of 2 times), which take over the duration values of the syllables to match.

The distinction between the first two rules and the latter rule can also be found in early treatises on music, introducing the terms ''metrum'' and ''rhythmus''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wagner (1916). Zur ursprünglichen Ausführung des Gregorianischen Gesanges. ''Gregoriusblatt'', 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Jeannin (1930). Proportionale Dauerwerte oder einfache Schattierungen im Gregorianischen Choral? ''Gregoriusblatt'', 54, 129–135.&lt;/ref&gt; As it could also be demonstrated by Van Kampen that melodic peaks often coincide with the word accent (see also),&lt;ref&gt;G. Reese (1940). ''Music in the Middle Ages''. New York: Norton &amp; Comp., p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; the conclusion seems warranted that the Gregorian melodies enhance the expressiveness of the Latin words by mimicking to some extent both the accentuation of the sacred words (pitch differences between neumes) and the relative duration of the word syllables (by paying attention to well-defined length differences between the individual notes of a neume).

During the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries in France, the system of rhythmic notation became standardized, with printers and editors of chant books employing only four rhythmic values. Recent research by Christopher Holman indicates that chants whose texts are in a regular meter could even be altered to be performed in [[Time signature]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holman|first=Christopher|date=November 2017|title=Rhythm and metre in French Classical plainchant|url=https://academic.oup.com/em/article-abstract/45/4/657/4781684|journal=Early Music|volume=45, vol. 4|pages=657–664|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melodic restitution===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
Recent developments involve an intensifying of the semiological approach according to Dom Cardine, which also gave a new impetus to the research into melodic variants in various manuscripts of chant. On the basis of this ongoing research it has become obvious that the Graduale and other chantbooks contain many melodic errors, some very consistently, (the mis-interpretation of third and eighth mode) necessitating a new edition of the Graduale according to state-of-the-art [[melodic restitution]]s. Since the 1970 a melodic restitution group of AISCGre (International Society for the Study of Gregorian Chant) has worked on an "editio magis critica" as requested by the 2. Vatican Council Constitution "Sacrosanctum Concilium". As a response to this need and following the Holy See's invitation to edit a more critical edition, in 2011 the first volume "De Dominicis et Festis" of the "Graduale Novum Editio Magis Critica Iuxta SC 117"was published by Libreria Editrice Vatican and ConBrio Verlagsgesellschaft, Regensburg.

In this approach the so-called earlier 'rhythmic' manuscripts of unheightened neumes that carry a wealth of melo-rhythmic information but not of exact pitches, are compared in large tables of comparison with relevant later 'melodic' manuscripts' that are written on lines or use double alphabetic and neumes notation over the text, but as a rule have less rhythmic refinement compared to the earlier group. However, the comparison between the two groups has made it possible to correct what are obvious mistakes. In other instances it is not so easy to find a consensus. In 1984 Chris Hakkennes published his own transcription of the Graduale Triplex. He devised a new graphic adaptation of square notation 'simplex' in which he integrated the rhythmic indications of the two most relevant sources, that of Laon and Skt. Gallen.

Referring to these manuscripts, he called his own transcription Gradual Lagal. Furthermore, while making the transcription, he cross-checked with the melodic manuscripts to correct modal errors or other melodic errors found in the Graduale Romanum. His intention was to provide a corrected melody in rhythmic notation but above all – he was also a choirmaster – suited for practical use, therefore a simplex, integrated notation. Although fully admitting the importance of Hakkennes' melodic revisions, the rhythmical solution suggested in the Graduale Lagal was actually found by Van Kampen (see above) to be rather modestly related to the text of the chant.

==Liturgical functions==
Gregorian chant is sung in the Office during the [[canonical hours]] and in the liturgy of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Texts known as ''[[Accentus Ecclesiasticus|accentus]]'' are intoned by bishops, priests, and deacons, mostly on a single [[reciting tone]] with simple melodic formulae at certain places in each sentence. More complex chants are sung by trained soloists and choirs. The [[Graduale Romanum]] contains the proper chants of the Mass (i.e., Introit, Gradual, Alleluia, Tract, Offertory, Communion) and the complete [[Kyriale]] (the collection of Mass Ordinary settings).  The ''[[Liber usualis]]'' contains the chants for the [[Graduale Romanum]] and the most commonly used Office chants.

===Proper chants of the Mass===
The Introit, Gradual, Alleluia, Tract, Sequence, Offertory and Communion chants are part of the [[Proper (liturgy)|Proper]] of the Mass. "Proprium Missae" in Latin refers to the chants of the Mass that have their proper individual texts for each Sunday throughout the annual cycle, as opposed to 'Ordinarium Missae' which have fixed texts (but various melodies) (Kyrie, Sanctus, Benedictus, Agnus Dei).

[[Introit]]s cover the procession of the officiants. Introits are antiphonal chants, typically consisting of an antiphon, a psalm verse, a repeat of the antiphon, an intonation of the Gloria Patri [[Doxology]], and a final repeat of the antiphon. [[Reciting tone]]s often dominate their melodic structures.

[[Gradual]]s are responsorial chants that follow the reading of the [[Epistle]]. Graduals usually result from ''[[centonization]]''; stock musical phrases are assembled like a patchwork to create the full melody of the chant, creating families of musically related melodies. Graduals are accompanied by an elaborate Verse, so that it actually consists in two different parts, A B. Often the first part is sung again, creating a 'rondeau' A B A. At least the verse, if not the complete gradual, is for the solo cantor and are in elaborate, ornate style with long, wide-ranged melismata.

The [[Alleluia]] is known for the ''[[jubilus]]'', an extended joyful melisma on the last vowel of 'Alleluia'. The Alleluia is also in two parts, the alleluia proper and the psalmverse, by which the Alleluia is identified (Alleluia V. Pascha nostrum). The last melisma of the verse is the same as the jubilus attached to the Alleluia. Alleluias are not sung during penitential times, such as [[Lent]]. Instead, a [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]] is chanted, usually with texts from the Psalms. Tracts, like Graduals, are highly centonized.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[Sequence (poetry)|Sequences]] are sung poems based on couplets. Although many sequences are not part of the liturgy and thus not part of the Gregorian repertory proper, Gregorian sequences include such well-known chants as ''[[Victimae paschali laudes]]'' and ''[[Veni Sancte Spiritus]]''. According to [[Notker Balbulus]], an early sequence writer, their origins lie in the addition of words to the long melismata of the jubilus of Alleluia chants.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Crocker, ''The Early Medieval Sequence'' pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Offertory|Offertories]] are sung during the offering of Eucharistic bread and wine. Offertories once had highly prolix melodies in their verses, but the use of verses in Gregorian Offertories disappeared around the 12th century. These verses however, are among the most ornate and elaborated in the whole chant repertoire. Offertories are in form closest to Responsories, which are likewise accompanied by at least one Verse and the opening sections of both Off. and Resp. are partly repeated after the verse(s). This last section is therefore called the 'repetenda' and is in performance the last melodic line of the chant.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[Communion (chant)|Communions]] are sung during the distribution of the [[eucharist (Catholic Church)|Eucharist]]. In presentation the Communio is similar to the Introitus, an antiphon with a series of psalm verses. Communion melodies are often tonally ambiguous and do not fit into a single [[musical mode]] which has led to the same communio being classed in different modes in different manuscripts or editions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Ordinary chants of the Mass===
The Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Benedictus and Agnus Dei use the same text in every service of the Mass. Because they follow the regular invariable "order" of the Mass, these chants are called "[[Ordinary of the Mass|Ordinary]]".

The [[Kyrie]] consists of a threefold repetition of "Kyrie eleison" ("Lord, have mercy"), a threefold repetition of "Christe eleison" ("Christ have mercy"), followed by another threefold repetition of "Kyrie eleison." In older chants, "Kyrie eleison imas" ("Lord, have mercy on us") can be found. The Kyrie is distinguished by its use of the [[Hellenistic Greek|Greek language]] instead of Latin. Because of the textual repetition, various musical repeat structures occur in these chants. The following, Kyrie ad. lib. VI as transmitted in a Cambrai manuscript, uses the form ABA CDC EFE', with shifts in [[tessitura]] between sections. The E' section, on the final "Kyrie eleison", itself has an aa'b structure, contributing to the sense of climax.&lt;ref&gt;Hiley, ''Western Plainchant'' p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Kyrie 55, Vatican ad lib. VI, Cambrai.ogg|title=Kyrie 55, Vatican ad lib. VI, from Cambrai, Bibl. Mun. 61, fo.155v, as transcribed by David Hiley|description=Example of musical repeat structures in Gregorian chant}}
The [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]] recites the Greater [[Doxology]], and the [[Credo]] intones the [[Nicene Creed]]. Because of the length of these texts, these chants often break into musical subsections corresponding with textual breaks. Because the Credo was the last Ordinary chant to be added to the Mass, there are relatively few Credo melodies in the Gregorian corpus.

The [[Sanctus]] and the [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]], like the Kyrie, also contain repeated texts, which their musical structures often exploit.

Technically, the [[Ite missa est]] and the [[Benedicamus Domino]], which conclude the Mass, belong to the Ordinary. They have their own Gregorian melodies, but because they are short and simple, and have rarely been the subject of later musical composition, they are often omitted in discussion.

===Chants of the Office===
Gregorian chant is sung in the [[canonical hours]] of the [[monastic]] Office, primarily in antiphons used to sing the [[Psalms]], in the Great [[Responsory|Responsories]] of [[Matins]], and the Short Responsories of the Lesser Hours and [[Compline]]. The psalm antiphons of the Office tend to be short and simple, especially compared to the complex Great Responsories.

At the close of the Office, one of four ''[[Marian antiphon]]s'' is sung. These songs, ''Alma Redemptoris Mater'' (see top of article), ''Ave Regina caelorum'', ''Regina caeli laetare'', and ''Salve, Regina'', are relatively late chants, dating to the 11th century, and considerably more complex than most Office antiphons. [[Willi Apel]] has described these four songs as "among the most beautiful creations of the late Middle Ages."&lt;ref&gt;Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

===Medieval and Renaissance music===
Gregorian chant had a significant impact on the development of [[medieval music|medieval]] and [[Renaissance music]]. Modern staff notation developed directly from Gregorian neumes. The square notation that had been devised for plainchant was borrowed and adapted for other kinds of music. Certain groupings of neumes were used to indicate repeating rhythms called [[rhythmic mode]]s. Rounded noteheads increasingly replaced the older squares and lozenges in the 15th and 16th centuries, although chantbooks conservatively maintained the square notation. By the 16th century, the fifth line added to the [[staff (music)|musical staff]] had become standard. The [[bass clef]] and the [[Flat (music)|flat]], [[Natural sign|natural]], and [[sharp (music)|sharp]] accidentals derived directly from Gregorian notation.&lt;ref&gt;Chew, Geoffrey and Richard Rastall: "Notation", ''Grove Music Online'', ed. L. Macy (Accessed 27&amp;nbsp;June&amp;nbsp;2006) (subscription access)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregorian melodies provided musical material and served as models for tropes and [[liturgical drama]]s. Vernacular hymns such as "[[Christ ist erstanden]]" and "[[Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist]]" adapted original Gregorian melodies to translated texts. Secular tunes such as the popular Renaissance "[[In Nomine]]" were based on Gregorian melodies. Beginning with the improvised harmonizations of Gregorian chant known as [[organum]], Gregorian chants became a driving force in medieval and Renaissance [[polyphony]]. Often, a Gregorian chant (sometimes in modified form) would be used as a ''[[cantus firmus]]'', so that the consecutive notes of the chant determined the harmonic progression. The Marian antiphons, especially ''Alma Redemptoris Mater'', were frequently arranged by Renaissance composers. The use of chant as a cantus firmus was the predominant practice until the [[Baroque]] period, when the stronger harmonic progressions made possible by an independent bass line became standard.

The Catholic Church later allowed polyphonic arrangements to replace the Gregorian chant of the Ordinary of the Mass. This is why the Mass as a compositional form, as set by composers like [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] or [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], features a Kyrie but not an Introit. The Propers may also be replaced by choral settings on certain solemn occasions. Among the composers who most frequently wrote polyphonic settings of the Propers were [[William Byrd]] and [[Tomás Luis de Victoria]]. These polyphonic arrangements usually incorporate elements of the original chant.

===20th century===
{{cn span|date=April 2017|text=The renewed interest in [[early music]] in the late 19th century left its mark on 20th-century music. Gregorian influences in classical music include the choral setting of four chants in ''[[Quatre Motets sur des thèmes grégoriens]]'' by [[Maurice Duruflé]], the carols of [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], and the choral work of [[Arvo Pärt]].
Gregorian chant is vaguely imitated into other genres, such as [[London Boys]]' [[Requiem (London Boys song)|Requiem]] and some other [[dance music|dance]] compositions, [[Enigma (musical project)|Enigma's]] ''[[Sadeness (Part I)]]'', the chant interpretation of [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]] by the German band [[Gregorian (band)|Gregorian]], the [[New-age music|new-age]] project [[Era (musical project)|Era]], the [[techno]] project [[E Nomine]], many of the songs by American [[power metal|power]]/[[thrash metal]] band [[Iced Earth]], and the work of [[black metal]] band [[Deathspell Omega]]. The modal melodies of chant provide unusual sounds to ears attuned to modern scales. It has also been used in ''[[The Omen]]''{{'}}s main theme, ''[[Ave Satani]]''.}}

====Popular culture====
The monks of Solesmes, discussed above for their revival of Gregorian chant, issued a number of recordings. However, when Gregorian chant as plainchant experienced a popular resurgence during the [[New-age music|new-age]] and [[World music|world-music]] movements of the 1980s and '90s, the iconic album was somewhat unexpectedly ''[[Chant (Benedictine Monks of Santo Domingo de Silos album)|Chant]]'', recorded by the [[Benedictine]] monks of [[Silos Abbey|Santo Domingo de Silos]], Spain. This was marketed as music to inspire timeless calm and serenity. In 2008, the Cistercian Monks of Austrian [[Heiligenkreuz Abbey]] released the CD ''Chant – Music for Paradise'', which became the best-selling album of the Austrian pop charts and peaked #7 of the UK charts. In the US, the album was released under the title ''Chant – Music for the Soul'' and peaked at #4 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] classical charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cistercian Monks of Stift Heiligenkreuz|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=cistercian monks of stift heiligenkreuz|chart=Classical Albums}}|work=Chart History|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalmusicclassical.com/artist/detail.aspx?nid=3599&amp;aid=96884 Universal news].{{dead link|date=January 2011}} Retrieved 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

It became [[conventional wisdom]] that listening to Gregorian chant increased the production of [[alpha wave]]s in the brain, reinforcing the popular reputation of Gregorian chant as tranquilizing music.&lt;ref&gt;Le Mée, ''Chant : The Origins, Form, Practice, and Healing Power of Gregorian Chant'' p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; {{cn span|date=April 2017|text=Gregorian chant has often been parodied for its supposed monotony, both before and after the release of ''Chant''. Famous references include the flagellant monks in ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' intoning "Pie Jesu Domine dona eis requiem" (Good Lord Jesus, grant them rest). "The Gregorian Chant" was the title of a British television play in the 60's starring [[Billie Whitelaw]] as a prostitute with unexpectedly refined tastes. Gregorian chant has been also used in ''[[Vision of Escaflowne]]'' and ''[[Death Note]]'' anime series, Disney's [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]], the theme of the Temple of Time in the [[Legend of Zelda]] series and the [[Halo (series)|Halo]] series of videogames, although it had been used in such a number of productions and movies that this is only a very selective list of examples.}}

'''''Halizah''''' (or '''''chalitzah''''' ; {{lang-he|'''חליצה'''}}) is, under the [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] system of [[levirate marriage]] known as ''[[yibbum]]'', the process by which a childless widow and a brother of her deceased husband may avoid the duty to marry.

The process involves the widow making a declaration, taking off a shoe of the brother (i.e. her brother-in-law), and spitting in his face. Through this ceremony, the brother and any other brothers are released from the obligation of marrying the woman for the purpose of conceiving a child which would be considered the progeny of the deceased man. The ceremony of chalitzah makes the widow free to marry whomever she desires ({{bibleverse-lb||Deuteronomy|25:5-10|HE}}).

It is sufficient for only one brother-in-law to perform the ceremony. The mode of levirate marriage ({{bibleverse||Genesis|38:8|HE}}) is thus modified in the Deuteronomic code attributed to [[Moses]], by permitting the surviving brother to refuse to marry his brother's widow, provided he submits to the ceremony of ''halizah''. In the Talmudic period the tendency against the original mode was intensified by apprehension that the brother-in-law might desire to marry his brother's widow for motives other than that of "establishing a name unto his brother." Therefore, many Talmudic and later rabbis preferred ''halizah'' to actual marriage ([[Yevamot]] 39b). Thus the ancient institution of the levirate marriage fell into disuse, so that at present ''halizah'' is the general rule and marriage the rare exception ([[Shulkhan Arukh]], Eben ha-'Ezer, 165, and commentaries).

In theory, however, the Biblical law of levirate marriage is still presumed in force, thus making the childless widow who remarries someone other than her brother-in-law without performing the ''halizah'' ceremony an adulterer.

==The ceremony==
Deuteronomy describes the ceremony simply. In the presence of town elders, the widow recites a prescribed formula which scolds him for not building his brother's household, loosens the shoe of the brother-in-law, and spits in his face. In the Talmud, however, the rabbis explained the ceremony as a more solemn and public act. The ceremony must take place before a court of three, who need not be very learned, but must at least understand Hebrew ([[Yevamot]] 101a; [[Shulkhan Arukh]], [[Even Ha'ezer|Even ha-`Ezer]], 169, 1). All those who are disqualified from testifying in legal matters are disqualified also from acting on this board of judges ([[Yevamot]] 101a). These three appoint two others to assist them, and at the service on the evening preceding the day of the ceremony they appoint a place for its performance, to give the matter more publicity. The place chosen is usually the synagogue court or the house of the rabbi, although the ceremony may take place in the house of the widow. All investigations into the concerned parties are conducted the previous day, on which both are instructed in ceremony details, and on which the ''yebamah'' (widowed sister-in-law) is not allowed to eat. The ''halizah'' should not be performed in the evening ([[Yevamot]] 104a), nor on a Sabbath or a holiday ([[Beitzah]] 36b), nor on the eve of a Sabbath or a holiday ("[[Israel Isserlein|Terumat ha-Deshen]]", § 227).

On the day set for the ''halizah'', immediately after the morning service, when all the people are still in the synagogue, the three judges and their two assistants, who also act as witnesses, meet at the appointed place. The three judges sit on one bench, the two assistants on a bench placed beside it; the ''yabam'' (brother-in-law) and the ''yebamah'' stand between them. Before the ceremony, a public examination establishes the relationship of the parties and their maturity. If one is a minor, a deaf-mute, a mute, or mentally handicapped, or has a crooked or turned foot, the ''halizah'' cannot be performed. The court must also know whether she is left-handed or whether he is left-footed, and must be convinced that more than ninety-one days have passed since the death of her husband (see [[Jewish views of marriage#Divorce|Jewish views of marriage: Divorce]]; [[Levirate marriage]]).

To establish these matters it is not necessary to have legally eligible witnesses. Even those who are otherwise disqualified from testifying may become witnesses. Both the ''yabam'' and the ''yebamah'' must be made aware of the fact that by this ceremony the widow becomes free to marry whomever she may desire.

==The ''halizah'' shoe==
[[File:Judaic halizah shoe for declining to marry a childless widow, United States, New York, 20th century - Bata Shoe Museum - DSC00157.JPG|thumb|right|A ''halizah'' shoe, New York, 20th century, in the [[Bata Shoe Museum]]]]

After these preliminary details, and after the ''yabam'' makes a public declaration that he has not been forced by outside influence to submit to the ''halizah'', but acts of his own free will, the ceremony commences. The shoe, which is usually the property of the community, is brought forth and examined as to cleanliness and construction, in accordance with the precepts of the law. The ''halizah'' shoe is made entirely of leather, usually from the hide of a [[kashrut|kosher]] animal.

It is made of two pieces, the upper part and the sole, sewn together with leather threads. Three small straps are attached to the front of the shoe, each of which has a knot (''humrata'') at the top to fit a hole made on the other side of the shoe. Two white leather straps attach to either side of the shoe and fasten it to the leg.

The ''yabam'' must have his right foot, on which the shoe is placed, washed very scrupulously, and after he has strapped it on he must walk four [[cubit]]s in the presence of the judges. Then the chief judge reads the following passage, which the ''yebamah'' repeats word for word: 
: "My brother-in-law refuses to raise unto his brother a name in Israel; he will not marry me."
Then the ''yabam'' repeats the sentence: 
: "I do not wish to take her."
He then presses his right foot against the floor while she loosens the straps with her right hand and, holding his leg in her left hand, takes off the shoe and throws it some distance away. Then she places herself in front of the ''yabam'', spits on the floor in front of him, and repeats these words after the presiding judge:
: "So shall it be done unto that man who will not build up his brother's house, and his name shall be called in Israel, 'the house of him that hath his shoe loosed."
She repeats the last phrase three times and the assembly recites it three times after her. Then the ''yabam'' returns the shoe to the court, and the judges say:
: "May it be the will [of God] that Jewish women be no more subjected to ''halizah'' or to ''[[yibbum]]''." 
As they rise, the chief of the judges says:
: "Blessed be He who sanctified us with the commandments and statutes of Abraham our father."
All the passages recited by the ''yabam'' and by the ''yebamah'' must be read in Hebrew as they are found in the original in Deuteronomy. If the parties do not understand Hebrew the passages must be translated for them ([[Even Ha'ezer|Even ha-`Ezer]], 169; "Seder Halizah" and commentaries ad loc.).

The ceremony of loosening the shoe has been explained in various ways. From the incident in the [[Book of Ruth]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Ruth|4:7–8|HE}}), which certainly refers to this ancient custom, it seems the loosening of the shoe symbolized a transfer of rights, and had no stigma attached to it. Some later rabbis&amp;mdash;[[Yechiel of Paris]], for instance&amp;mdash;say the removal of the shoe symbolized the entrance into a state of mourning. From the time the ''yabam'' refused to marry his brother's widow and thus perpetuate his name in Israel, the brother was considered dead, and the ''yebamah'', by drawing off his shoe, thus declared to him that from that time on he was a mourner ("Perush Seder Halizah," 82; comp. Weill, "La Femme Juive," part iv., ch. v., Paris, 1874).

Another possibility comes from ''Wesley's Notes'': 
{{quote|Deut 25:9 Loose his shoe - As a sign of his resignation of all his right to the woman, and to her husband's inheritance: for as the shoe was a sign of one's power and right, Psa 60:8 108:9, so the parting with the shoe was a token of the alienation of such right; and as a note of infamy, to signify that by this disingenuous action he was unworthy to be amongst free - men, and fit to be reduced to the condition of the meanest servants, who used to go barefoot (Isa 20:2,4).}} Deut 25:10 His name - That is, his person, and his posterity also. So it was a lasting blot.

A similar example of renouncing rights by removing one's shoe, in this case the renunciation of rights to redeem one's brother's land, appears in the [[Book of Ruth#Levirate|Book of Ruth]] in the ''[[ketubim]]''.

==''Halizah'' document==

[[File:Earliest Known New Zealand Ketubah or Yibbum (wedding contract).jpg|thumb|[[ketubah|Marriage contract]] of Esther Solomon and Benjamin Levy, [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], 1 June 1842, witnessed by Alfred Hort and [[Nathaniel William Levin]].]]
To prevent the ''yabam'' from extorting money from the widow who wishes release from the shackles of perpetual widowhood, the Rabbis established the institution of the ''shetar halizah'' ("''halizah'' document"). This institution provides that at a young couple's marriage, all brothers must sign a document pledging to submit to ''halizah'' without remuneration, in case their brother dies childless ("Nahalat Shib'ah," p.&amp;nbsp;22, Warsaw, 1884). In the case of a minor brother, who could not legally sign the document, the institution of the ''shetar bit'hon halizah'', established by the Rabbis for such cases, had the father of the bridegroom promise to pay money to the bride if the minor son should later refuse the ''halizah'' ceremony (ib. 23; comp. "Pithe Teshubah"; Eben ha-'Ezer, 165, note 10; See Inheritance). The practice of signing these ''halizah'' documents has fallen out of currency in [[North America]].

==Frequency==

Although rare, [[Orthodox Jews]] still observe halizah in all its details when the occasion requires.  There are generally between 10 and 20 ceremonies per year in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;14 in 2014  {{cite podcast

==In Reform Judaism==

The [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] view, as expressed in various treatises written by the leaders of the movement, and as adopted at the different rabbinical conferences held in Germany and in America, is that the ceremony of ''halizah'' is not essential to the remarriage of the widow. The [[Reform Judaism#America and Classical Reform|Philadelphia Conference]] (1869) resolved that "The precept of levirate marriage and of ''halizah'' has lost to us all meaning, import, and binding force." The Second Israelite Synod, held in [[Augsburg]] (1871), passed a resolution to the same effect, adding that "For the sake of liberty of conscience, however, no rabbi will refuse, on request of the parties, to conduct the ceremony of ''halizah'' in a proper form."

'''Hsin Tao''' or '''Hsin-tao''' ({{zh|t=心道|p=Xīndào}}; born 1948 in [[Lashio]], [[Myanmar]]), born '''Yang Jinsheng''' ({{zh|t=楊進生}}), is a [[Buddhist]] monk who set up the [[Ling Jiou Mountain Buddhist Foundation]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.093ljm.org/ |title=Master Hsin Tao| publisher=Ling Jiou Mountain Buddhist Foundation | accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also known for his efforts in international and [[interfaith dialog]], especially on dialog with some Muslim groups.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Hsin Tao was born in Burma, where his family had emigrated from [[Yunnan]] in China. At the age of 9, he joined a guerrilla group and engaged in warfare for the next four years. Then, when he was 13 years old, he followed the [[Republic of China Army]] to Taiwan. He became interested in the [[Yiguandao]] religion when he was 15, still serving in the Army. He was discharged at the age of twenty.

=== Into Buddhism ===
He was ordained as a novice monk in 1973 at the age of 25 under Venerable Master [[Hsing Yun]] at [[Fo Guang Shan]], and entered Tsung Lin Buddhist College at the same time.&lt;ref name="gflp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gflp.org/WeekofDialogue/master.html |title=Dharma Master Hsin Tao| publisher=[http://www.gflp.org/ Global Family for Love &amp; Peace] | accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, he went to a mountainous area of Taipei city,  Waishuanghsi(外雙溪), and meditated there for over eighteen hours a day. The following year (1975), Hsin Tao sought out an even more remote location, in Yilan County, to continue his practice. At the age of 31 (1979), he moved to Longtan, Yilan, where he continued to meditate, for twenty hours each day. Three years later (1982, age 34), he began a six month retreat, including long fasts, with neither food or water. In 1983, he moved to a mountain overlooking the eastern coast of Taiwan in Fulong. His daily diet was nine "hundred flower pills" (百花丸，a type of Chinese medicine) and spring water.

=== Founding his temple ===
He later founded the Ling Jiou Mountain Monastery in 1983.  Through the Ling Jiou Mountain Buddhist Foundation, he founded the [[Museum of World Religions]] (世界宗教博物館) in the [[Yonghe District]] of [[New Taipei City]], [[Taiwan]], in 2001. He founded the [[Global Family for Love and Peace]]&lt;ref name="gflp" /&gt; in [[New York City|New York]], United States, in 2002.
He is also interested in [[interfaith dialogue]] and currently sits on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the [[Elijah Interfaith Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elijah-interfaith.org/?id=730 Elijah Interfaith Institute - Buddhist Members of the Board of World Religious Leaders]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2322">'''Hufaidh''' is a mythical island in the marshes of southern [[Iraq]], believed to exist by the [[Marsh Arabs|Ma'dan]] or Marsh Arabs.

The Ma'dan informants of the traveller [[Wilfred Thesiger]] asserted that:

{{quote|on it are palaces, and palm trees and gardens of pomegranates, and the buffaloes are bigger than ours. But no one knows exactly where it is... anyone who sees Hufaidh is bewitched, and afterwards no one can understand his words...They say the [[Jinn]]s can hide the island from anyone who comes near it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Marsh Arabs'', Wilfrid Thesiger, Penguin 1967, pp84-85&lt;/ref&gt;}}

R.S.M. Sturges (Political Officer at Qurnah in 1920) shared with Thesiger a possible connection between Hufaidh and the biblical Garden of Eden.  Sturges wrote about the local legend of “a lost island in the marshes bearing luscious fruits and guarded . . . On certain nights it shone with a radiance visible for many miles. It seemed to move like some out-size will-o'-the-wisp and eluded all attempts to track it down . . . I saw it myself once – a strong diffused glow as of the full moon just below the horizon.” &lt;ref&gt;Maitland, Alexander. Wilfred Thesiger: The Life of the Great Explorer, pg 310, HarperPress, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Thesiger's host, Sadam, earlier related that “One of the Fartus saw it, years ago, when I was a child. He was looking for buffalo and when he came back his speech was all muddled up, and we knew he had seen Hufaidh."

He further said, “Saihut, the great AIbu Muhammad sheikh, searched for Hufaidh with a fleet of canoes in the days of the Turks, but he found nothing.

When Thesiger made some skeptical comment Sadam emphatically said, "No, Sahib, Hufaidh is there all right. Ask anyone, the sheikhs or the Government. Everyone knows about Hufaidh." &lt;ref&gt;Thesiger, Wilfred. The Marsh Arabs. Penguin, 2007. pp 84-85&lt;/ref&gt;

The island is, perhaps, analogous to the Irish mythical island of [[Hy-Brazil]].

The '''Institute of the Good Shepherd''' ({{lang-fr|Institut du Bon Pasteur}}) is a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Consecrated life (Catholic Church)#Societies of apostolic life|society of apostolic life]] of [[traditionalist Catholic]] priests in [[full communion]] with the [[Holy See]].

==Background==
Father [[Paul Aulagnier]], who had been provincial superior of the [[Society of Saint Pius X]] in France from 1976 to 1994 was expelled in 2003 for having spoken in favour of the 2002 agreement between the Holy See and the priests of Campos, Brazil who form the [[Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://la.revue.item.free.fr/regard_monde290306.htm Les accords avec Rome Mgr Lefebvre-Mgr Fellay]&lt;/ref&gt; These priests were authorised to use the [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine form]] of the [[Roman Rite]] on the condition of recognising the [[Second Vatican Council]] "in the light of Tradition" and the validity of the [[Mass of Paul VI|revised Roman Missal]] promulgated by Pope Paul VI.

In August 2004 Father [[Philippe Laguérie]] was expelled for having complained that the Society of Saint Pius X had serious problems which discouraged priestly vocations in its seminaries. As a disciplinary measure he had been transferred to Mexico, but refused the assignment.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.sspx.org/miscellaneous/dici_100.htm The case of Fr. Philippe Laguérie in Bordeaux] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013233824/http://www.sspx.org/miscellaneous/dici_100.htm |date=2006-10-13 }} - SSPX USA&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Laguérie had for many years been in charge of the church of [[Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet]] in Paris, occupied by traditionalist Catholics since 1977. In 1993, he made an attempt to take over another Paris church, the [[Church of Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois]]. He carried out the operation successfully at Bordeaux, obtaining the approval of the city council, but not of the archbishop's office, to take over the church of Saint-Eloi in January 2002.&lt;ref&gt;"En 1993, il avait tenté d’occuper une autre église parisienne, Saint-Germain-l’Auxerrois. Il a réussi l'opération à Bordeaux en obtenant du Conseil municipal de la ville, mais pas de l'archevêché, d'occuper l'église Saint-Eloi, en janvier 2002" ([http://news.catholique.org/laune/11567-d-anciens-pretres-et-seminaristes-de-la La Une (News)] 8 September 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Christophe Héry was expelled for supporting Laguérie, as was Father Guillaume de Tanoüarn. The latter was the founder of the religious association of Saint-Marcel and the Saint-Paul Centre in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;"M l’abbé de Tanouarn installe son brillant « Centre saint Paul » à Paris."[http://qien.free.fr/2006/200609/20060921_aulagnier.htm Interview by Father Aulagnier, 21 September 2006]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June 2006, a French court in [[Nanterre]] (chambre du Tribunal de grande instance de Nanterre) ordered the reinstatement of Fathers Laguérie and Héry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://la.revue.item.free.fr/flash_info210606.htm La Justice déclare illégales et annule les exclusions des abbés Laguérie et Héry ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation of the Institute==
They had already decided to embark on a new path (while, according to at least one of them, remaining members of the Society of St Pius X).&lt;ref&gt;"Je reste toujours membre de la FSSPX, jusqu’à ma mort. Je ne peux me résoudre à quitter ce que j’ai aimé. Follement. L’Eglise a besoin d’elle. Elle a besoin de tous ses prêtres." (I still remain a member of the SSPX. Until death. I cannot get myself to abandon what I have loved, madly loved. The Church needs the Society. She needs all her priests.)[http://qien.free.fr/2006/200609/20060912_aulagnier.htm L’Institut du Bon Pasteur - par l’abbé Paul Aulagnier]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 September 2006, the liturgical feast of Our Lady's Birthday, they, together with Father Henri Forestier, who also was stationed in Bordeaux, formed the Institute of the Good Shepherd,&lt;ref&gt;[http://la.revue.item.free.fr/fondation_pasteur.htm Decree of erection and Press communiques]&lt;/ref&gt; a society of apostolic life in full communion with the Holy See. Several seminarians joined the new fraternity, some of them close to ordination, and Cardinal [[Darío Castrillón Hoyos]], who signed the decree approving their constitutions for a preliminary experimental period of five years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://la.revue.item.free.fr/commission_pontifical.htm Decree of Approval]&lt;/ref&gt; promised to confer the sacrament of orders on them.

Father Laguérie had declared in March 2006 that agreement with the [[Holy See]] was required by the very constitution of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], and he asked his parishioners to take note of the signs of good will on the part of Rome and of its intention to put an end to the doctrinal turmoil and the scandals of 1960-2000. He pointed to an address of Pope Benedict&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/december/documents/hf_ben_xvi_spe_20051222_roman-curia_en.html Pope Benedict XVI's address to the Roman Curia], 22 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; as a condemnation of using "the spirit of the Council" as a pretext for excesses.

==Agreement with the Holy See==
The Holy See granted the members of the new institute use, as the institute's own rite, of the "Tridentine" form of the [[Roman Rite]], employing the 1962 [[Roman Missal]]. For their part, each of the founding members personally undertook to respect the authentic Magisterium of the See of Rome with "complete fidelity to the infallible Magisterium of the Church."&lt;ref&gt;Statutes II §2&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the institute may engage in a [[criticism]] of the [[Second Vatican Council]] that is serious and constructive and in accord with [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s address of 22 December 2005 to the [[Roman Curia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/december/documents/hf_ben_xvi_spe_20051222_roman-curia_en.html English translation of the address]&lt;/ref&gt; while recognizing that it is for the [[Apostolic See]] to give the authentic interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://frat.canalhistorique.free.fr/200609/Communique%20Bon%20Pasteur.htm?num=126344 |title=Communiqué des prêtres de l'Institut du Bon Pasteur |access-date=2006-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208170350/http://frat.canalhistorique.free.fr/200609/Communique%20Bon%20Pasteur.htm?num=126344 |archive-date=2011-02-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present situation==
In less than five months, by 6 February 2007, membership had grown to ten priests and two deacons - one close to priestly ordination - incardinated in the institute and listed by name on Father Laguérie's [http://blog.institutdubonpasteur.org/spip.php?article3 blog]. In its two formation houses it also had a not-yet-incardinated deacon, a subdeacon and eight other seminarians. There was one brother (a lay member of the institute). The ordination on 3 March 2007 added another two priests, while maintaining the number of deacons at two. Priests from many places were requesting incardination, but the institute exercised prudence in their regard.

Cardinal Castrillón fulfilled the promise he made when the Institute was founded and on 22 September 2007 ordained five priests of the Institute, one of whom was a former member of the Society of St. Pius X. The [[archbishop of Bordeaux]] and president of the French [[episcopal conference]], [[Jean-Pierre Ricard]], was present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-958747@51-954064,0.html Un cardinal venu de Rome ordonne cinq prêtres traditionalistes de l'Institut du Bon Pasteur], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 24 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

By 8 September 2008, the priests of the Institute had grown to 18, and the seminarians to 30. The priests became 22 in the following month and 24 in the spring of 2009.&lt;ref name=deux&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.institutdubonpasteur.org/home.php?area=actualites |title=l’IBP a deux ans |access-date=2009-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006104953/http://www.institutdubonpasteur.org/home.php?area=actualites |archive-date=2009-10-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, the Institute had in France a house of formation for its seminarians studying philosophy, and a residence in Rome for its students of theology. It had eight Mass centres in France, and one in each of five other countries: Chile, Colombia, Italy, Poland and Spain. It also had three schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institutdubonpasteur.org/home.php?area=messe Messe et réseaux (Mass and networks)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006110102/http://www.institutdubonpasteur.org/home.php?area=messe |date=2009-10-06 }} Retrieved 15 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd had come into existence with two Sisters taking the veil.

As of 2015 the Institute had 33 priestly members. They opened a house on Home headed by Father Raffray who was assisted by Father Giorgio Lenzi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=[Institute of the Good Shepherd - Communiqué of the Superior General] Official opening of the House of St. Clement in Rome|url=http://tradinews.blogspot.ie/2015/10/institut-du-bon-pasteur-communique-du.html|website=Tradinews.blogspot.com|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin America District==
On 1 November 2006, Father Rafael Navas Ortiz was nominated superior for the Latin America District.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibp-la.org/distrito/?ss=superior&amp;a=&amp;l=es Latin America District Superior Nomination Letter]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, as mentioned above, the district has 3 houses: one in Santiago, Chile and another in Bogotà, Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibp-la.org/info/?ss=localizacion&amp;l=es Address of the houses in Latin America]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were unconfirmed rumours in February 2008 that Cardinal [[Francisco Javier Errázuriz Ossa]], the Archbishop of Santiago, Chile ordered the Institute to cease celebrating the Tridentine Mass and leave the country. It is not authorized to celebrate the Tridentine Mass publicly in Santiago and his celebrations are therefore of private character, as permitted by the motu proprio [[Summorum Pontificum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://delbuenpastor.blogspot.com/ Información del Instituto del Buen Pastor]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 2011, an independent chapel located in Bogota, Colombia was officially incardinated into the IBP by the Archbishop of Bogota, and is now officially recognized by the Archdiocese.  The priest of the chapel has been given faculties to say public Masses (TLM) and hear confessions.

In Brasil the Institute has two churches, one in Brasília and one in São Paulo.

'''''Interpretatio graeca''''' ([[Latin]], "Greek translation" or "interpretation by means of Greek [models]") is a [[discourse]]&lt;ref&gt;Characterized as "discourse" by Mark S. Smith, ''God in Translation: Deities in Cross-Cultural Discourse in the Biblical World'' (Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2008, 2010), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek religious concepts and practices]], [[List of Greek mythological figures|deities]], and [[Greek mythology|myths]] are used to interpret or attempt to understand the mythology and religion of other cultures. It is thus a [[Comparative religion|comparative]] methodology that looks for [[Comparative mythology|equivalencies and shared characteristics]]. The phrase may describe Greek efforts to explain others' beliefs and myths, as when [[Herodotus]] describes [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]] in terms of perceived Greek analogues, or when [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] and [[Plutarch]] document [[Cultus deorum|Roman cults]], [[Roman temple|temples]], and practices under the names of equivalent Greek deities. ''Interpretatio graeca'' may also describe non-Greeks' interpretation of their own belief systems by comparison or assimilation with Greek models, as when [[ancient Romans|Romans]] adapt Greek myths and iconography under the names of their own gods.

'''''Interpretatio romana''''' is comparative discourse in reference to [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman mythology|myth]], as in the formation of a distinctive [[Gallo-Roman religion]]. Both the Romans and the Gauls reinterpreted Gallic religious traditions in relation to Roman models, particularly [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]].

[[Jan Assmann]] considers the [[polytheism|polytheistic]] approach to internationalizing gods as a form of "intercultural translation":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The great achievement of polytheism is the articulation of a common semantic universe.&amp;nbsp;... The meaning of a deity is his or her specific character as it unfolded in myths, hymns, rites, and so on. This character makes a deity comparable to other deities with similar traits. The similarity of gods makes their names mutually translatable. … The practice of translating the names of the gods created a concept of similarity and produced the idea or conviction that the gods are international.&lt;ref&gt;''Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism'' (Harvard University Press, 1997), pp. 44–54 (quotation p. 45),  as cited by Smith, ''God in Translation,'' p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] expressed the "translatability" of deities as "different names to different peoples" ''(nomina alia aliis gentibus).''&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 2.5.15.&lt;/ref&gt; This capacity made possible the [[syncretism|religious syncretism]] of the [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenistic era]] and the pre-Christian [[Roman Empire]].

==Examples==
[[File:Hall of the Augustals.jpg|thumb|A Roman fresco from [[Herculaneum]] depicting [[Hercules]] (from Etruscan ''[[Hercle]]'' and ultimately Greek ''[[Heracles]]'') and [[Achelous]] (patron deity of the [[Achelous River]] in Greece) from [[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology]], 1st century AD]]
[[Herodotus]] was one of the earliest authors to engage in this form of interpretation. In his observations regarding the Egyptians, he establishes Greco-Egyptian equivalents that endured into the [[Hellenistic era]], including [[Amun|Amon]]/[[Zeus]], [[Osiris]]/[[Dionysus]], and [[Ptah]]/[[Hephaestus]]. In his observations regarding the [[Scythians]], he equates their queen of the gods, [[Tabiti]], to [[Hestia]], [[Papaios]] and [[Api]] to [[Zeus]] and [[Gaia]] respectively, and [[Argimpasa]] to [[Aphrodite Urania]], whilst also claiming that the Scythians worshipped equivalents to [[Herakles]] and [[Ares]], but which he doesn't name.

Some pairs of Greek and Roman gods, such as Zeus and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], are thought to derive from a common [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] archetype ([[Dyeus]] as the supreme sky god), and thus exhibit shared functions by nature. Others required more expansive theological and poetic efforts: though both [[Ares]] and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] are war gods, Ares was a relatively minor figure in Greek religious practice and deprecated by the poets, while Mars was a father of the Roman people and a central figure of archaic Roman religion.

Some deities dating to Rome's oldest religious stratum, such as [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]] and [[Terminus (mythology)|Terminus]], had no Greek equivalent. Other Greek divine figures, most notably [[Apollo]], were adopted directly into Roman culture, but underwent a distinctly Roman development, as when [[Augustus]] made Apollo one of his [[tutelary deity|patron deities]]. In the early period, [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan culture]] played an intermediary role in transmitting Greek myth and religion to the Romans, as evidenced in the linguistic transformation of Greek ''[[Heracles]]'' to Etruscan ''[[Hercle|Her[e]cle]]'' to Roman ''[[Hercules]]''.

==''Interpretatio romana''==
The phrase ''interpretatio romana'' was first used by the [[Roman Empire|Imperial-era]] [[Roman historiography|historian]] [[Tacitus]] in the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Germania'' [http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Germania#43 43.]&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus reports that in a [[sacred grove]] of the [[Nahanarvali]]&lt;!--also spelled Naharvali--&gt;, "a priest adorned as a woman presides, but they commemorate gods who in Roman terms ''(interpretatione romana)'' are [[Castor and Pollux]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Praesidet sacerdos muliebri ornatu, sed deos interpretatione romana Castorem Pollucemque memorant."&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Germania'' [http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Germania#9 9.]&lt;/ref&gt; he identifies the principal god of the Germans as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], perhaps referring to [[Wotan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4rezhDpcWwkC&amp;pg=PA251 |title=Robert Leo Odom, '&amp;#39;Sunday in Roman Paganism'&amp;#39; (TEACH 2003 ISBN 978-1-57258242-2), pp. 251-252 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2003-01-01|accessdate=2013-01-24|isbn=9781572582422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sulis Minerva head Bath.jpg|thumb|Gilt bronze head from the cult statue of Sulis Minerva from the [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Temple at Bath]]]]

Some information about the deities of the ancient [[Gauls]] (the [[continental Celts]]), who left no written literature other than inscriptions, is preserved by Greco-Roman sources under the names of Greek and Latin equivalents. A large number of [[Gaulish]] [[theonym]]s or cult titles are preserved, for instance, [[Mars (mythology)#Provincial epithets|in association with Mars]]. As with some Greek and Roman divine counterparts, the perceived similarities between a Gallic and a Roman or Greek deity may reflect a common Indo-European origin.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Koch, "Interpretatio romana," in ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'' (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 974.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lugh]] was identified with [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], [[Nodens]] with Mars as healer and protector, [[Sulis]] with [[Minerva]]. In some cases, however, a Gallic deity is given an ''interpretatio romana'' by means of more than one god, varying among literary texts or inscriptions. Since the religions of the [[Greco-Roman world]] were not dogmatic, and [[polytheism]] lent itself to multiplicity, the concept of "deity" was often expansive, permitting multiple and even contradictory functions within a single divinity, and overlapping powers and functions among the diverse figures of each pantheon. These tendencies extended to cross-cultural identifications.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, "Interpretatio romana," in ''Celtic Culture'', pp. 974–975; Assmann, ''Moses the Egyptian'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Eastern empire, the [[Teshub|Anatolian storm god]] with his [[labrys|double-headed axe]] became [[Jupiter Dolichenus]], a favorite cult figure among soldiers. Roman scholars such as [[Varro]] interpreted the monotheistic god of the Jews into Roman terms as [[Caelus]] or [[Jupiter Optimus Maximus]]. Some Greco-Roman authors seem to have understood the Jewish invocation of [[Yahweh]] [[Sabaoth]] as [[Sabazius]].

==''Interpretatio germanica''==
''Interpretatio germanica'' is the practice by the [[Germanic peoples]] of identifying Roman gods with the names of [[Germanic deities]]. According to [[Rudolf Simek]], this occurred around the 1st century of the common era, when both cultures came into closer contact. Some evidence for ''interpretatio germanica'' exists in the Germanic translations of the Roman [[Names of the days of the week|names for the days of the week]]:

* [[Sunday]], the day of [[Sowilō|Sunnǭ]] ({{lang-on|Sunna}}, ''Sól''; {{lang-ang|Sunne}}; {{lang-goh|Sunna}}), the sun (as female), was earlier the day of [[Sol Invictus]], the sun (as male)
* [[Monday]], the day of [[Máni|Mēnô]] (Máni; Mōna; Māno), the moon (as male), was earlier the day of [[Moon|Luna]], the moon (as female)
* [[Tuesday]], the day of [[Tyr|Tīwaz]] (Týr; Tīw; Ziu), was earlier the day of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], god of war
* [[Wednesday]], the day of [[Odin|Wōdanaz]] (Óðinn; Wōden; Wuotan), was earlier the day of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], god of travelers and eloquence
* [[Thursday]], the day of [[Thor|Þūraz/Þunraz]] (Þórr; Þunor; Donar), was earlier the day of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], god of thunder; Þunraz may elsewhere appear identified with the club-wielding [[Hercules]]
* [[Friday]], the day of [[Frijjō]] (Frigg; Frīg; Frīja), was earlier the day of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], goddess of love

In most of the [[Romance languages]], which derive from Latin, days of the week still preserve the names of the original Roman deities, such as the Italian for Tuesday, ''martedì'' (from the Latin ''Martis dies''). This is also the case with Saturn in some [[West Germanic languages]]; such as the English "Saturday", the [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] ''[[:fy:Sneon|Saterdei]]'', the [[Low German]] ''[[:nds:Saterdag|Saterdag]]'' and the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''[[:nl:Zaterdag|zaterdag]]'' all meaning [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]'s day.[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Saturday&amp;allowed_in_frame=0]

Simek emphasizes the paucity of evidence and notes that comparison with Roman gods is insufficient to reconstruct ancient Germanic gods and equate them definitively with those of later [[Norse mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Simek, Rudolf. (2007) Translated by Angela Hall. ''Dictionary of Northern Mythology''. [[Boydell &amp; Brewer|D.S. Brewer]], p. 74. {{ISBN|0-85991-513-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greco-Roman equivalents==
The following is a list of Greek, Roman, Etruscan, Egyptian, and Phoenician equivalents, based on usage among the ancients themselves, supported by the analyses of modern scholars.{{cn|date=June 2018}} "Equivalent" should not be taken to mean "the same god". For instance, when the myths or even cult practices of a particular Roman deity were influenced by the Greek or Etruscan tradition, the deity may have had an independent origin and a tradition that is culturally distinctive.

==Application to the Jewish religion==

From the Roman point of view, it was natural to apply the above principle also to the [[Jew]]ish God [[Jehovah]] and equate him with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. However, the Jews – unlike other people living under Roman rule – rejected out of hand any such attempt, regarding such an identification as the worst of sacrilege. This complete divergence of views was one of the factors contributing to the frequent friction between the Jews and the Roman Empire – for example, the Emperor [[Hadrian]]'s decision to rebuild [[Jerusalem]] under the name of [[Aelia Capitolina]], a city dedicated to Jupiter, precipitated the bloodbath of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]].

In late antiquity mysticism, the sun god [[Helios]] is sometimes equated to the Judeo-Christian God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/viewFile/15325/6623]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Lakota mythology]], '''Íŋyaŋ''' (Rock) was the first of the powerful spirits.  He existed before the beginning.  He then created Maka and gave it the spirit [[Makȟá-akáŋl]] (Earth spirit), the second of the spirit beings and a part of Íŋyaŋ. After creating Makȟá, Íŋyaŋ was very weak. He created miniature versions of Makȟá, and her lover, father sky. Those miniatures were humans.  This effort made Íŋyaŋ hard and powerless.  His blood became the blue waters and the sky.

{{Islam by country}}
Islam is the official religion of the [[United Arab Emirates]]. More than 80% of the population of the United Arab Emirates are non-citizens. Virtually all Emirati citizens are Muslims; approximately 85% are [[Sunni]] and 15% are [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]]. There are smaller number of [[Ismaili]] [[Shias]] and [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2122.html?countryName=Pakistan&amp;countryCode=pk&amp;regionCode=sas&amp;#pk| publisher=CIA | title=The World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners are predominantly from [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]], although there are substantial numbers from the [[Middle East]], [[Europe]], [[Central Asia]], the former [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], and [[North America]]. The [[Al Nahayan]] and [[Al Maktoum]] ruling families adhere to the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence from the [[Uyunid dynasty]], whom spread of the Maliki school came by the command of Sheikh [[Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=11804c8631cb4110VgnVCM100000b0140a0aRCRD&lt;/ref&gt;

There are more [[Sunni]] than [[Shiite]] Muslims among the residents. There are also smaller number of [[Ismaili]] [[Shias]] and [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]].&lt;ref name="The World Factbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2122.html?countryName=Pakistan&amp;countryCode=pk&amp;regionCode=sas&amp;#pk| publisher=CIA | title=The World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UAE's judicial system is derived from the [[civil law system]] and [[Sharia law]]. The court system consists of civil courts and [[Sharia|Sharia courts]]. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], UAE's criminal and civil courts apply elements of Sharia law, codified into its criminal code and family law. 

Sharia courts in the UAE have a significant amount of authority. [[Flogging]] is a punishment for criminal offences such as adultery, premarital sex and alcohol consumption.&lt;ref name=bergner&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NqIkQz68_fgC&amp;pg=PA2203|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2008|work=Jeffrey T.

The '''Jewish Future Alliance''' is a [[New York City|New York]]–based volunteer group founded by Rabbi Yaacov Behrman dedicated to advocating on behalf of the Jewish community and other minorities.
Since its launch, the JFA has emerged as an objective and respected voice of reason representing Jewish communities across the spectrum of belief in the United States and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;.http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/12/10/brooklyn-councilwoman-apologizes-for-knockout-game-comments/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jainism}}
[[Image:Kevalajnana.jpg|thumb|Kevala Jñāna of Mahavira]]
'''Kevala jñāna''' means [[omniscience]] in [[Jainism]] and is roughly translated as absolute knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1991|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; or supreme knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kumar|2001|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevala jnana is believed to be an intrinsic quality of all souls. This quality is masked by karmic particles that surround the soul. Every soul has the potential to obtain omniscience by shedding off these karmic particles. Jain scriptures speak of twelve stages through which the soul achieves this goal. A soul who has attained kevala jnana is called a ''kevalin'' ({{lang|sa|केवलिन्}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2000|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jains, only kevalins can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The views of two sects of Jainism, [[Digambara]] and [[Śvētāmbara]] Jains differ on the subject of ''kevalins''. According to Digambaras, a kevalin does not experience hunger or thirst, whereas according to Svetambaras, a ''kevalin'' has normal human needs and he travels and preaches too. Digambara Jains believe that they do not act in the normal sense of the word, that they sit motionless in [[Lotus position|padmasana]], and that their bodies emit ''Divyadhvani,'' a sacred sound which is interpreted by their followers as the fundamental truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=45 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kabay|first=Paul|date=2013-05-09|title=Interpreting the Divyadhvani: On Why the Digambara Sect Is Right about the Nature of the Kevalin|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/506674|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=63|issue=2|pages=176–193|doi=10.1353/pew.2013.0020|issn=1529-1898}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to both traditions, the last ''kevalin'' was a disciple of one of the eleven chief disciples of the last ''[[tirthankara]]'', [[Mahāvīra]]; his name is recorded as [[Jambuswami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|2004|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that no one after Jambuswami will have the ability to obtain kevala jnana.

==Literary sources==
The claim of existence of omniscience by Jains, who deny the existence of a creator god, is a unique phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2001|p=98 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sutrakritanga]] text of the Svetambara school, elaborates the concept as all-knowing and provides details of his other qualities.&lt;ref name="Dundas 2002 25"&gt;{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another text, the [[Kalpa Sūtra]], gives details of Mahavira's omniscience
{{quote|When the Venerable Ascetic Mahavira had become a [[Tirthankara|Jina]] and Arhat ([[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]]), he was a Kevali, omniscient and comprehending all objects; he knew and saw all conditions of the world, of gods, men, and demons: whence they come, whither they go, whether they are born as men or animals or become gods or hell-beings (''upapada''), the ideas, the thoughts of their minds, the food, doings, desires, the open and secret deeds of all the living beings in the whole world; he the Arhat (Arihant), for whom there is no secret, knew and saw all conditions of all living beings in the world.:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2001|pp=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Immediately after the death of Mahavira, his disciple [[Indrabhuti Gautama]] became a ''kevalin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|2004|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per the tradition, the teachings of the tirthankara were memorized and preserved over many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|2004|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second ''Upanga Agama'', the ''Rājapraśnīya'', there is a dialogue between Kesi, a disciple of [[Pārśva]], and [[Payasi]], a [[materialist]] king. In this dialogue, Kesi proves the existence of [[jiva]] and its ability to obtain kevala jñana to the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jains have a long debate with [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Buddhist]]s regarding omniscience. [[Bhikkhu]] [[Dharmakirti]] criticized the Jain notion of omniscience in his ''Pramanavartika''. The Hindu philosopher [[Kumarila]] argued that only [[Veda]] had the authority to define human moral values since they were "beginningless, authorless and of self-sufficient validity". In response, the [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]] [[Haribhadra]] (c. 8th century CE) wrote that humans already had knowledge of everything knowable. It only had to be illuminated or uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omniscience was, according to Haribhadra, inherent to living beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samantabhadra (Jain monk)|Samantabhadra]] was the first philosopher-monk in the history of Indian philosophy who tried to use inference as a method to establish the existence of omniscience&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his famous work, ''[[Aptamimamsa]]'', Samantabhadra asserts:{{quote|Objects that are minute (like atoms), past (like Lord Rama), and distant (like Mount Meru), being the objects of inference (''anumeya'' – and, therefore, also objects of knowledge – ''prameya''), must be perceivable directly by someone; like the fire on the hill is an object of inference for a distant person but is perceived directly by the one who is in its proximity. The one who perceives directly the objects of knowledge that are minute, past, and distant is the Omniscient (''sarvajña''); this way the existence of the Omniscient is truly and firmly established.|Āptamīmāṁsā (5){{sfn|Jain|2016|p=10}}}}

[[Akalanka]] (c. 720 760 CE) put forward the concept of ''suniscita-asambhavad-badhaka-pramana'' as a reason for the existence of omniscience. This concept is a well-known fact which is "we have no valid methods of knowing to deny the existence of omniscience".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hemacandra]] (c. 1088 1173) combined Samantabhadra and Akalanka's ideas of ''sarvajña'' in his ''Pramanamimasa'' to establish the existence of omniscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jain epistemology==
{{Main article|Jain epistemology}}
In Jain epistemology, there are two kinds of valid methods of knowledge: ''pratyakṣa'' or "direct knowledge" and ''parokṣa'' or "indirect knowledge". Kevala-jñana is considered ''pratyaksa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five ways of obtaining knowledge are defined: ''matijñana'' acquired through sensory perception; ''srutajñana'' acquired through understanding of verbal and written sentences; ''avadhijñana'', ''manhaparyaya jñana'' and kevala jñana.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains contrast all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with ''[[Anekantavada]]'', which can be explained through the parable of the "[[blind men and an elephant]]". In this story, each blind man felt a different part of an elephant (trunk, leg, ear, etc.). All the men claimed to understand and explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed, due to their limited perspectives.&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;{{cite book | title=The voice of Prophets | publisher=Lulu.com | last=Hughes | first=Marilynn | series=Volume 2 of 12 | year=2005 | location=Morrisville, North Carolina | pages=590–591 | isbn=1-4116-5121-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is more formally stated by observing that objects are infinite in their qualities and modes of existence, so they cannot be completely grasped in all aspects and manifestations by finite human perception. According to the Jains, only the ''Kevalis''—omniscient beings—can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Jaini | first=Padmanabh | year=1998 | location=New Delhi | pages=91 | isbn=81-208-1578-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, no single, specific, human view can claim to represent [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]].

==Stages of spiritual development==
{{Main article|Gunasthana}}
According to Jain texts, there are fourteen stages (''gunasthana'') of spiritual development. The soul can gradually frees itself, firstly from the worst, then from the less bad and finally from all kinds of karma, and manifests the innate qualities of knowledge, belief and conduct in a more and more perfect form. The first four ''gunasthana'' are related to belief or rationality in perception. As and when the soul acquires rationality in perception it moves on to 4th ''gunasthana''. Stages 5 to 14 relate to conduct. The purity in conduct determines the gunasthana from 5th stage onwards. Those who have taken the ''anuvratas'' {minor vows} may reach up to the 5th Gunasthana. The 6th to 14th Gunasthanas can only be attained by those who have taken the ''[[Mahavrata]]s'' (major vows) of [[Jain ascetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|2001|pp=186–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following are the stages of spiritual development:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini1998|pp=272–273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tatia|1994|pp=274–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Kosuke Koyama'''|小山 晃佑|Koyama Kōsuke|extra=December 10, 1929 – March 25, 2009}} was a [[Japan]]ese Protestant [[Christian theology|theologian]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;{{cite news|title=Kosuke Koyama, 79, an Ecumenical Theologian, Dies|first=Douglas|last=Martin|date=March 31, 2009|accessdate=April 1, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/world/asia/01koyama.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Koyama was born in [[Tokyo]] in 1929, of Christian parents. He later moved to [[New Jersey]] in the [[United States]], where he completed his [[Bachelor of Divinity|B.D.]] at [[Drew Theological Seminary]] and his [[Ph.D.]] at [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], the latter on the interpretation of the [[Psalms]] of [[Martin Luther]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="Cohn-Sherbok"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Cohn-Sherbok|editor-first=Lavinia |title=Who's Who in Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ln2BAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-1-134-50956-0|page=172|chapter=Koyama, Kosuke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After teaching at a theological seminary in [[Thailand]], he was the executive director of Association of Theological Schools in Southeast Asia with his office in Singapore from 1968 to 1974, and the editor of Southeast Asia Journal of Theology, and the Dean of Southeast Asia Graduate School of Theology. After that he worked as Senior Lecturer in Religious Studies at the [[University of Otago]] in [[Dunedin]] in [[New Zealand]], from 1974 to 1979. He later worked at the [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] in [[New York City]], where he stayed until his retirement in 1996 as John D. Rockefeller Jr. Professor Emeritus of World Christianity. To his close friends and family, he was known as "Ko". Along with [[Kazoh Kitamori]], he is considered one of the leading Japanese theologians of the twentieth century.

Koyama died at a hospital in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Massachusetts]], of [[pneumonia]] complicated by oesophagal [[cancer]], on March 25, 2009.  His wife Lois died April 13, 2011. He is survived two sons, a daughter, and five grandchildren.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

== Writings ==
In works such as ''Water Buffalo Theology'' and ''Three Mile an Hour God'', he defended a theology that he considered to be accessible to the peasantry in [[developing nations]], rather than an overly academic systematic theology. In total, Koyama wrote thirteen books. One of his most well-known books, "Water Buffalo Theology", was described as "ecological theology, [[liberation theology]] and contribution to Christian-Buddhist dialogue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cityparadise.blogspot.com/2007/03/water-buffalo-theology-notes.html|title=Water Buffalo Theology notes|date=3 March 2007|first=Leah|last=Chang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Water Buffalo Theology'' is probably Koyama's best-known work. The book was partly inspired by Koyama's work as a missionary in Northern Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praxishabitus.blogspot.com/2009/04/kosuke-koyamas-water-buffalo-theology.html|title=Kosuke Koyama's Water Buffalo Theology|date=1 April 2009|first=Gerardo|last=Marti}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works of ''Mount Sinai and Mount Fuji'' and ''Water Buffalo Theology'' are, in part, an examination of Christian theology within the context of Thai [[Buddhist]] society, growing out of Koyama's missionary experience in [[Thailand]]. Koyama was an editor of the ''South East Asia Journal of Theology'', for which he himself wrote a considerable number of articles. Koyama published at least thirteen books, including "On Christian Life" (currently available only in Japanese) and over one hundred scholarly articles. Koyama's work has been described as helping to bridge the boundaries between East and West, between Christianity and Buddhist thought, between the rich and the poor. It  has been pointed out that he has no overarching system in this theology, which shows commitment to serving a "broken Christ trying to heal a broken world". He was named as an important figure for the development of a [[world Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Cohn-Sherbok"/&gt;

In ''No Handle on the Cross:  An Asian Mediation on the Crucified Mind'' (1976), Koyama explained how the cross can be considered the symbol of Christian suffering, and began the book with a chapter entitled "The Cross and the Lunchbox". Koyama explained, in the preface to this book, which he wrote in [[Tokyo]] at [[Christmas]] 1975, how he did Christian missionary work in [[Thailand]] from 1960 to 1968, and how his experiences in Thailand rekindled interest in Asian religion in him. He also explained in the preface how the book grew out of the [[Earl Lectures]] which he delivered at the [[Pacific School of Religion]] in [[California]]. Koyama also spoke at a conference in [[Edinburgh]] in 1985, in which he described [[God]] as "a hot God", suggesting a certain dynamic quality to the attributes of God. In this book, he reflected on his interest in the relationship between [[history]] and [[theology]], and pointed out the imperial nature of Indo-European languages among those speakers of languages such as [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] or [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. He also told, in this book, of an incident which happened to him in [[Singapore]], where he met a Buddhist monk from [[Sri Lanka]]. He told the monk about crusades for [[Jesus Christ]] and the monk looked puzzled. "Why do you need to crusade?" asked the monk. The monk indicated that if one felt a need to crusade, then one was not a true disciple. Instead, the monk championed, true to his [[Buddhist]] beliefs, the virtue of [[self-denial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koyama|first=Kosuke|year=1976|title=No Handle on the Cross: An Asian Meditation on the Crucified Mind|location=London|publisher=SCM Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a local tradition of the [[Mascarene Islands]], '''Kérdik''' (French and creole: [kɛʀ'dik], from classical Sanskrit: हार्दिकः ['ha:rdikə], PIE ['ker] "the heart", with influence of creole's noun for "heart": [keʁ]) is a solar deity or a demon, which is able to [[avatar|incarnate]] into living beings such as animals or human beings. People who witness one of his incarnations are said to lose their minds and end up obeying to the deity.

In Mascarene Islands, [[witchcraft]] and testimonies about possessions are somehow common. In this context, the god Kérdik appears like a mix between cultures present in the Indian Ocean where [[Hinduism]] and Afro-European mythologies are very active together. Kérdik is said to be the son of the Hindu goddess [[Kali]] – already worshiped in Hindu communities of the islands, but who don't acknowledge the cult of Kérdik – and the Snake God [[Ouroboros|Paradise]] who is the protector of the Divine Garden.

Some people who "encountered" Kérdik said he looks like a tall skinny humanoid creature  with greenish blue skin, "sun-coloured" hair and lizard grey eyes. He can take on avatars by which he may possess and control third parts. He is a god of love, war, action and humor. He is not described as a handsome god. However, he has sufficient charisma to make people happy with his presence and bow their will under his power. He teaches human beings to search for innocent pleasures, friendship and respect for nature. He is somehow an eco-god and is worshiped as a human incarnation of the [[Solar deity|Sun]].

Although Kérdik is a god of humor and happiness, he may convert into a terrifying creature with armour. He then crushes his own worshipers under his huge celestial form. Every morning, he makes another world with his head associated to the Sun and he guards the night with his eyes associated with the Moon and the stars. One of his main attributes is the heart, which may explain his name. Because of local mixity in religions, he is revered as the Sacred Heart in Christian contexts. His name is said to come from the secret Sun's name. Another symbol for him, is then the [[Dharmacakra]]. It is not clear whether there is or not any Buddhist reference.

Among other symbols we find animals such as birds, reptiles, fishes and goats. As Kérdik's birth take place after the solstice of December which marks the astrological month of Capricorn, fishes and goats are very common symbols. For the ones who "encountered" Kérdik, they try to celebrate the annual festival within the celebrations of Christmas and Epiphany.

Kérdik's cult is not official and yet not acknowledged by the majority of the population of the Mascarene Islands. Thus his legend may be part of the local folklore which is very creative, among witches and ghosts popular stories.

From what the description we have, Kérdik appears like a local blend of mythologies such as [[Pan (god)|Pan]] or [[Crius]] in the Greek mythology, [[Loki]] in the Norse myths and above all, the vedic [[Surya]] with whom many characteristics are common.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="937">"Miri-Piri" is a concept that has been practiced in Sikh religion since seventeenth century. The concept of “Miri-Piri” was started by sixth Guru of [[Sikhism]] [[Guru Hargobind]] in June 12, 1606. After the martyrdom of his father, Guru was conquered to the Guruship and fulfilled the prophecy that was given by primal figure of Sikh [[Baba Buddha]] that the guru will possess spiritual and temporal power. [[Guru Hargobind]] introduced the two swords of Miri and Piri symbolizing both worldly (political) and spiritual authority&lt;ref&gt;Jakobsh, D. R. (2012). '''Sikhism'''. University of Hawaii Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. The two [[kirpan]] of Miri and Piri are tied together with a [[Khanda (Sikh symbol)|khanda]] in center, where Piri is considered supreme then Miri because it symbolizes [[Spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;Singh, D. (1992). '''THE SIKH IDENTITY'''. Fundamental Issues, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In that context, nang can mean either ''kangāl'' ({{lang-pa|ਕੰਗਾਲ}} "destitute") or ''nanga'' (one without clothes).&lt;ref name="nangmahan"&gt;Nang, Mahankosh&lt;/ref&gt; If a member of Nihang army is convicted via [[court-martial]], his royal blue uniform is removed and his license of to keep arms is cancelled, leading to his excommunication from the [[Khalsa]]. Only [[Jathedar]]s of Nihang Dals such as Budha Dal have authority to punish their army members after trial.

'''Nauruan indigenous religion''' is a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] system of belief that includes a [[Goddess|female deity]] called [[Eijebong]] and an island of spirits called [[Buitani]]. Believers say that the sky and the earth were created by a [[spider]] called [[Areop-Enap]]. There are very few, if any, people on the island who still subscribe to this religion, because of the dominant belief of [[Christianity]] imposed upon them by Christian colonization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6420">The '''New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn''' (abbreviated NROOGD, commonly pronounced "nuh-'''roo'''g'd") is a [[Wicca]]n organization/tradition/denomination that, despite its name, has little or nothing to do with the original [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].

The NROOGD Tradition of the Craft originated in 1967 with a group of friends (including e.l.f. Silverlocke, Glen Turner, Judy Greenwood, and [[Aiden Kelly]]). e.l.f. Silverlocke was taking a class at [[San Francisco State College]], which gave her the assignment of creating and leading a ritual. She came up with the idea of recreating a Witches' Sabbath, using published sources from [[Robert Graves]], [[Margaret Murray]] and [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], a ritual was composed that has served as the basis of NROOGD practice ever since. After repeat performances of this rite yielded results on a number of occasions, a decision was made to create a group identity and train others in its performance.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, 1986, pp. 162–165&lt;/ref&gt;

The name New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn was coined since it was a wholly new Tradition, it was Orthodox since it took its beliefs from the ancients, and it was a Magical Order as was the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. They considered themselves in some sense the spiritual and magical successors of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]].&lt;ref&gt;Adler, 1986, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Bonewits considers NROOGD to be the quintessential (and probably the first) "California Eclectic" Wiccan Tradition, near the "liberal/heterodox" end of his Wiccan spectrum of "orthodoxy/heterodoxy."&lt;ref&gt;Bonewits, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

The mother circle of NROOGD hived off daughter and granddaughter covens, which trace an unbroken line of initiation and share a common liturgy.

Covens are autonomous and recognize one another's initiates. The Tradition worships a triply aspected Goddess and various forms of the God derived from ancient Greek and British mythology.

Coven Esbats are usually held [[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|skyclad]], (Some covens do choose to work robed.) and focus on the working of ethical magic and the celebration of the divinity of each participant.

In 1976, the governing body of the NROOGD called the Red Cord Council was dissolved, and a consensus decision to call the Order a Tradition was made.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, 1986, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, those groups tracing their lines of initiation back to a member of the original group and who share certain forms of liturgy consider themselves part of the NROOGD tradition.

The core NROOGD ritual, is made of poetry and charms, and begins with a line dance in the form of a spiral inwards and then outwards, representing death and rebirth. Central to the public face of the Tradition is the celebration of the solar cycle, as observed through public [[Sabbats]].

NROOGD public ritual is often known for a particularly poetic style of conjuration, the invocation of the Lord and the Lady (in her triple aspect), and the use of the Spiral Dance. Some have called NROOGD a "bardic" Tradition, because of its strong emphasis on poetic expression and the power of words and song.

Initially, the ritual performance required three priestesses and one priest, but now this form is usually reserved for large public rituals; the smaller coven meetings typically require only one of each. Although magical workings vary in form and content, they often include enchantments and simple verse. Mythic enactments corresponding to a needed transformation may also be performed.

NROOGD continues to hold large public ritual celebrations at each of the eight [[Sabbat]]s for the benefit of the greater [[Pagan]] community, and periodic meetings of area covens are held to decide responsibilities for the coming year.

[[Esbat]]s in NROOGD covens usually focus on the working of magic, or on celebration of the divinity of each participant, recognizing and greeting the force of a usually triply aspected Goddess and God. The magical workings vary in form and content, but often include charms and simple poetry. Poetic ritual writing is much encouraged by the tradition. Mythic enactments corresponding to a needed transformation may also be performed.

Sharing food and drink (called a Love Feast) usually wraps up the agenda, as all prepare themselves to reenter their daily reality. Gods, Demigods, or other spirits at each of the cardinal directions serve as Guardians of the Circle and of the Elements, and are usually different for each coven. Names of the Gods tend to be idiosyncratic to each group and some covens keep them secret nowadays.

During the late 1980s and 1990s, younger members expanded inherited liturgy by writing new poetry and songs for new rituals. This continues in the Tradition today. NROOGD encourages creative expression, and these new writings serve to keep the Tradition alive.

NROOGD covens in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] cooperate to present public (clothed) ritual celebrations on most of the Sabbats, for the benefit of the greater [[Pagan]] community. Often in the fall, NROOGD enacts a ritual at the seaside inspired by and commemorating the Greater [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] of the [[Greece|Hellenic]] world.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, 1986, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt;

NROOGD member covens are primarily based in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], yet practitioners are found all over the State of California, The Southwest, the Pacific Northwest, the East Coast, Canada and the UK. There is neither central authority nor spokesperson for the tradition.

NROOGD Laws of the Craft:&lt;ref&gt;Adler, 1986, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

* An it harm none, do as ye will.
* You may not alter another's life/karma without his or her permission.
* Solve the problem, no more, no less.
* You must help your brothers and sisters in the Craft as best you can.
* If you stick your hand in a flame, you'll get burned.

'''''Psilocybe hoogshagenii''''' is species of [[psilocybin mushroom]] in the [[Strophariaceae]] family. The mushroom has a brownish conical or bell-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide that has an extended [[umbo (mycology)|papilla]] up to 4&amp;nbsp;mm long. The stem is slender (up to 3&amp;nbsp;mm thick) and {{convert|5|to|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''P.&amp;nbsp;hoogshagenii'' var. ''convexa'' lacks the long papilla.

The species is found in Mexico, where it grows singly or in small groups in clayey soils in [[subtropical]] coffee plantations, and from Colombia and Brazil in South America. The mushroom contains the [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] compounds [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]], and all parts will stain blue or bluish black when handled or injured. ''P.&amp;nbsp;hoogshagenii'' is used for [[divination|divinatory]] purposes by some indigenous groups in Mexico.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first [[species description|described]] scientifically by French mycologist [[Roger Heim]] in 1958.&lt;ref name="urlMycoBank: Psilocybe hoogshagenii"/&gt; It was one of several species described and illustrated in the popular American weekly magazine ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' ("[[Seeking the Magic Mushroom]]"), in which [[R. Gordon Wasson]] recounted the [[psychedelic experience|psychedelic visions]] that he experienced during the divinatory rituals of the [[Mixtec people]], thereby introducing psilocybin mushrooms to Western popular culture;&lt;ref name=Wasson1957/&gt; it was however, mislabeled as ''Psilocybe zaptecorum''.&lt;ref name=Beug2011/&gt; Similarly, ''Psilocybe'' specialist [[Gastón Guzmán]] suggests that ''[[Psilocybe zapotecorum|P.&amp;nbsp;zapotecorum]]'', as described by [[Rolf Singer]] in 1958,&lt;ref name=Singer1958/&gt; is misidentified as it agrees well with the [[type (biology)|type]] of ''P.&amp;nbsp;hoogshagenii''.&lt;ref name=Guzman1983/&gt; The species ''Psilocybe caerulipes'' var. ''gastonii'', described by Singer in 1958,&lt;ref name=Singer1958/&gt; is a [[synonym (biology)|synonym]] of ''P.&amp;nbsp;hoogshagenii''.&lt;ref name=Guzman1983/&gt;

The species is named in honor of American anthropologist Searle Hoogshagen,&lt;ref name=Hoogshagen1959/&gt; who helped Heim and Wasson in their search for entheogenic mushrooms in Mexico.&lt;ref name=Guzman1983/&gt; The mushroom is known locally by several [[common name]]s. In Spanish, it is called ''los niños'' or ''los Chamaquitos'' ("the little boys"), in [[Mazatec language|Mazatec]] as ''pajaritos de monte'' ("little birds of the woods"), in [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] as ''cihuatsinsintle'' or ''teotlaquilnanácatl'' ("divine mushroom that describes or paints"), and in [[Mixe languages|Mixe]] as ''Atka:t'' ("judge") or ''na.shwi.ñ mush'' ("mushrooms of the earth").&lt;ref name=Allen1997/&gt;

The [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''P.&amp;nbsp;hoogshagenii'' var. ''convexa'' was described by Guzmán in 1983 to account for mushrooms without an acute papilla that were otherwise roughly the same as the type variety. ''Psilocybe semperviva'', described by Heim and Roger Cailleux in 1958,&lt;ref name=Heim1958/&gt; was later determined by Guzmán to be [[synonym (biology)|synonymous]] with  ''P.&amp;nbsp;hoogshagenii'' var. ''convexa''.&lt;ref name=Guzman1978/&gt; The [[botanical name|varietal epithet]] ''convexa'' refers to the convex shape of the cap.&lt;ref name=Guzman1983/&gt;

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] ranges in shape from conical to bell-shaped to convex, reaching diameters of {{convert|0.7|–|3|in|abbr=on}}, although a range of {{convert|1|–|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} is most usual. It has a long, sharp [[umbo (mycology)|papilla]] that is up to {{convert|4|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The cap surface is smooth, somewhat sticky when wet, and often has ridges extending halfway to the center of the cap. Its color is reddish brown to orangish brown to yellowish, and it is [[hygrophanous]], fading when dry to a straw or [[fulvous]] color. The brownish [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] have an adnate to adnexed attachment to the stem; mature gills become purplish black because of the spores. The hollow [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] measures {{convert|50|to|90|mm|in|abbr=on}} long by 1–3&amp;nbsp;mm thick. It is roughly equal in width throughout its length or slightly thicker at the base, and sometimes twisted. A thin rudimentary cortina-like [[partial veil]] covers the gills of immature fruit bodies, but it is fragile and disappears soon after the cap expands. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] in the cap is whitish, but more yellow in the stem. Both the odor and taste of the mushroom are farinaceous (similar to freshly ground flour). As is characteristic of psilocybin mushrooms, all parts of the fruit body bruise blue when handled or injured. ''P.&amp;nbsp;hoogshagenii'' var. ''convexa'' lacks an acute papilla, although it occasionally has a small, rounded papilla. Its cap ranges in width from {{convert|0.5|–|1.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and it is convex to roughly bell-shaped. All other macroscopic and microscopic features are identical to the type variety.&lt;ref name=Guzman1983/&gt;

The [[spore print]] is dark purplish brown. [[Spore]]s are [[wikt:rhomboid|rhomboid]] or nearly so in face view, and more or less [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] when viewed from the side. They are thick-walled, with dimensions of 6.5–4–5.6&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]], and feature a broad [[germ pore]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are usually four-spored, [[hyaline]] (translucent), roughly cylindrical or with a central constriction, and measure 12–22 by 5.5–9&amp;nbsp;μm. Pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill face) are relatively abundant; they are ventricose (swollen), club-shaped or irregularly shaped, measuring 16–36 by 8–12&amp;nbsp;μm. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are also abundant. They are 19–35 by 4.4–6.6&amp;nbsp;μm, lageniform (flask-shaped), narrowing into a long neck with a width of 1–3&amp;nbsp;μm, and either acute or somewhat capitate (ending in a roughly globular tip). [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the [[hypha]]e.&lt;ref name=Guzman1983/&gt;

==Habitat and distribution==
Fruit bodies of ''Psilocybe hoogshagenii'' grow solitarily or in small groups in [[humus]] or in muddy clay soils in subtropical coffee plantations. According to the natives of the [[San Agustin Loxicha]] region of Mexico, the fungus tends to fruit simultaneously  in large flushes.&lt;ref name=Guzman1983/&gt; In Mexico, fruiting occurs in June and July, whereas in Argentina, fruiting is in February. The mushroom has been reported from Mexico in the states of [[Puebla]], [[Oaxaca]], and [[Chiapas]], where it grows at elevations of  {{convert|1000|to|1800|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Stamets1996/&gt; In South America, the species is known from Brazil and Colombia.&lt;ref name=Guzman2000/&gt; ''P.&amp;nbsp;hoogshagenii'' var. ''convexa'' has been found in [[grasslands]] in [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], and Oacaxa, but is most common in Puebla. It fruits from June to August.&lt;ref name=Guzman1983/&gt;

==Uses==
''Psilocybe hoogshagenii'' mushrooms are used for [[entheogenic]], or spiritual, purposes by some [[Chinantec]]-speaking [[curandero]]s of the [[Ixtlán District, Oaxaca|Ixtlán District]] in Oacaxa.&lt;ref name=RamirezCruz2006/&gt; The mushrooms are primarily used to diagnose and prognose illness, and, to a lesser extent, to [[divination|divine]] the location of objects or animals that have been lost or stolen.&lt;ref name=Rubel1976/&gt; Guzmán also indicates contemporary ceremonial usage by [[Mixe people|Mixe]] and [[Zapotec people|Zapotec]] people.&lt;ref name=Guzman2008/&gt; [[Paul Stamets]], in his ''Psilocybe Mushrooms of the World'', rates the psychoactive [[Potency (pharmacology)|potency]] of the mushroom as "moderately active", and reports psilocybin levels of 0.6% (milligrams per gram of dried mushroom), and psilocin of 0.1%. In comparison, Stamets indicates that the commonly cultivated species ''[[Psilocybe cubensis|P.&amp;nbsp;cubensis]]'' contains 0.63% and 0.60% (psilocybin and psilocin), while the widespread ''[[Psilocybe semilanceata|P.&amp;nbsp;semilanceata]]'' has 0.98% and 0.02%.&lt;ref&gt;Stamets (1996), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemical analysis of ''P.&amp;nbsp;hoogshagenii'' specimens from Brazil yielded up to 0.3% psilocybin and 0.3% psilocin.&lt;ref name=Stijve1993/&gt;

'''''Psilocybe liniformans'' var. ''americana''''',  is a [[psilocybin mushroom]] in the family [[Hymenogastraceae]]. It is in the section Semilanceatae of ''[[Psilocybe]]'' and has [[psilocybin]] as its main active compound.

==Description==
*The '''cap''' is 1 — 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm [[wikt:convex|convex]] to nearly plane, and is sometimes broadly [[wikt:umbonate|umbonate]] but not [[wikt:papillate|papillate]]. It is smooth, dull grayish brown to slightly [[wikt:olivacous|olivacous]], more reddish at the center, [[hygrophanous]], and becoming straw brown when dry with the center remaining more brownish. It sometimes has a bluish green tone, or olivacous tones at the margin when young.
*The '''gills''' are [[adnexed]], [[subdistant]], broad, and dark chocolate brown to purplish brown with age.
*The '''spores''' are dark purple brown, [[ellipsoid]], and 13 — 14.5 by 7.5 — 8.8(10)[[µm]].
*The '''stipe''' is 1.4 — 3.0&amp;nbsp;cm by 1 – 2&amp;nbsp;mm, equal, enlarging at the base. It is whitish to very pale brownish, darker below, bruising blue, and finely fibrillose in the lower portion. The partial veil is thin and soon disappears.
*The '''taste''' is weak to somewhat [[farinaceous]]; The '''odor''' is strongly aromatic to [[farinaceous]].
*'''Microscopic features''': The [[basidium|basidia]] are 4-spored and [[pleurocystidium|pleurocystidia]] are absent. The [[cheilocystidia]] are 22 — 33 by 5.5 — 9 [[µm]], [[wikt:lageniform|lageniform]] and have an extended neck.

==Habitat and formation==
''Psilocybe liniformans'' var. ''americana'' is found scattered to [[wikt:gregarious|gregarious]] in rich pastures or grasslands, fruiting from summer to early winter. It has been collected in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and [[Michigan]], and has also been reported from [[Chile]] where it fruits in the spring.
This mushroom is very close to the type variety; the main difference is the lack of a gelatinous layer on the edge of the [[lamella (mycology)|lamella]]e and the [[wikt:terricolous|terricolous]] habitat.

'''Shakti''' ([[Devanagari]]: शक्ति, [[IAST]]: Śakti; lit. "power, ability, strength, might, effort, energy, capability"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/mw/z.html |title= Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary |last= Williams |first= Monier |website= faculty.washington.edu |quote=śaktí f. power, ability, strength, might, effort, energy, capability}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the primordial [[energy (esotericism)|cosmic energy]] and represents the dynamic forces that are thought to move through the entire [[universe]]&lt;ref&gt;Sacred Sanskrit words, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hinduism]] and [[Shaktism]].

Shakti is the concept or personification of [[divine feminine]] creative power, sometimes referred to as "The Great Divine Mother" in Hinduism. As a mother, she is known as "[[Adi Shakti]]" or "[[Adi Parashakti]]". On the earthly plane, Shakti most actively manifests herself through female embodiment and creativity/fertility, though it is also present in males in its potential, unmanifest form.&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari, Path of Practice, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Hindus believe that Shakti is both responsible for creation and the agent of all change. Shakti is cosmic existence as well as liberation, its most significant form being the [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] Shakti, a mysterious psychospiritual force.&lt;ref&gt;The Shambhala Encyclopedia of Yoga, p.162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Shambhala Encyclopedia of Yoga, p.270&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Shaktism]], Shakti is worshipped as the [[Supreme Being]]. Shakti embodies the active feminine energy of [[Shiva]] and is synonymously identified with [[Tripura Sundari]] or [[Parvati]].

==Evolution==
{{Saktism}}
David Kinsley mentions the "shakti" of Lord Indra's as [[Sachi]] (Indrani), meaning power.&lt;ref&gt;Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Tradition by David Kinsley page 17, minor vedic Goddesses&lt;/ref&gt; Indrani is part of a group of seven or eight mother goddesses called the [[Matrikas]] ([[Brahmani]], [[Vaishnavi (Matrika goddess)|Vaishnavi]], [[Maheshvari]], [[Indrani]], [[Kumari (goddess)|Kumari]], [[Varahi]] and [[Chamundi]] or [[Narasimhi]]), who are considered shaktis of major Hindu gods ([[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], [[Indra]], [[Kartikeya|Skanda]], [[Varaha]]/[[Yama]] and [[Narasimha]] respectively).

[[File:Manasa Devi.jpg|thumb|left|The goddess [[Manasa]] in a dense jungle landscape with a cobra and a swan.]] The Shakti goddess is also known as Amma (meaning 'mother') in south India, especially in the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh. There are many temples devoted to various incarnations of the Shakti goddess in most of the villages in [[South India]]. The rural people believe that Shakti is the protector of the village, the punisher of evil people, the curer of diseases, and the one who gives welfare to the village. They celebrate Shakti Jataras with great interest once a year. Some examples of Shakti incarnations are [[Ganga]], [[Yamuna]], [[Kamakshi]], [[Kanaka Durga Temple|Kanakadurga]], [[Mahalakshmi]], [[Mahasaraswati]], [[Meenakshi]], [[Manasa]], [[Mariamman]], [[Yellamma]], [[Poleramma]], Gangamma and Perantalamma.

One of the oldest representations of the goddess in India is in a triangular form. The Baghor stone, found in a [[Paleolithic]] context in the [[Son River]] valley and dating to 9,000-8,000 years BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=FTqCAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=baghor%20stone%20date%20son%20valley&amp;pg=PA36|title=Archaeology and World Religion|last=Insoll|first=Professor of African and Islamic Archaeology Timothy|last2=Insoll|first2=Timothy|date=2002-09-11|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781134597987|location=|pages=36|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered an early example of a [[yantra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=NtKrbKIOL5wC&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=baghor%20stone%20roots%20of%20tantra&amp;pg=PA39|title=Roots of Tantra, The|last=Harper|first=Katherine Anne|last2=Brown|first2=Robert L.|date=2012-02-01|publisher=SUNY Press|year=|isbn=9780791488904|location=|pages=39|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Mark Kenoyer|Kenoyer]], part of the team that excavated the stone, considered that it was highly probable that the stone is associated with Shakti.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kenoyer|first=J.

==Shaktism==
[[File:Guruji puja.jpg|thumb|Sri Guru Amritananda Natha Saraswati, performing the Navavarana Puja, an important ritual in Srividya Tantric [[Shaktism]], at the Sahasrakshi Meru Temple at Devipuram, Andhra Pradesh, India.]]

[[Shaktism]] regards Devi (lit., "the Goddess") as the Supreme [[Brahman]] itself with all other forms of divinity considered to be merely Her diverse manifestations. In the details of its philosophy and practice, Shaktism resembles Shaivism. However, ''Shaktas'' (''Sanskrit: {{IAST|Śakta}}, {{lang|sa|शक्त}}''), practitioners of Shaktism, focus most or all worship on Shakti, as the dynamic feminine aspect of the Supreme Divine. [[Shiva]], the masculine aspect of divinity, is considered solely [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], and Shiva's worship is usually secondary.&lt;ref&gt;Subramuniyaswami, p. 1211.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
From ''Devi-Mahatmya'':

By you this universe is borne,
By you this world is created,
Oh Devi, by you it is protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klostermaier|first1=Klaus K.|title=A Survey of Hinduism|date=1989|publisher=State University of New York|location=NY, NY|pages=261 (fn 1 p 473)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
From ''Shaktisangama Tantra'':

Woman is the creator of the universe,
the universe is her form;
woman is the foundation of the world,
she is the true form of the body.

In woman is the form of all things,
of all that lives and moves in the world.
There is no jewel rarer than woman,
no condition superior to that of a woman.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Adi Parashakti===
{{main|Adi Parashakti}}
[[Adi Parashakti]], whose material manifestation is [[Tripura Sundari]], is a Hindu concept of the Ultimate Shakti or Mahashakti, the ultimate power inherent in all Creation. This is especially prevalent in the [[Shakta]] denomination within Hinduism, which worships the Goddess [[Devi]] in all her manifestations. Her human or Shakti swaroop/form, [[Parvati]], was married to [[Shiva]], while her knowledge/gyan swaroop form, [[Saraswati]], weds Lord [[Brahma]] and her wealth/Dhan swaroop form, [[Lakshmi]], becomes the consort of Lord [[Vishnu]].

===Smarta Advaita===
In the [[Smarta]] [[Advaita]] sect of Hinduism, Shakti is considered to be one of five equal bona fide personal forms of God in the [[panchadeva]] system advocated by [[Adi Shankara]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/dws/dws_mandala-02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shakti Peeths==
{{main|Shakti Peetha}}

According to some schools, there are four Adi Shakti Pitha and 51 Shakti centers of worship located in South Asia (four Adi Shakti Pitha are also part of 51 Shakti pithas but they are four major parts of Devi Sati's body. So, they are adi shakti pithas). They can be found in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan. These are called [[Shakti Peetha]]s. The list of locations varies. A commonly accepted list of Shakti Peethas and their temple complexes includes: 
* [[Hinglaj]] [[Mataji]] [[Balochistan]]
*[http://jawalaji.in/ Jwalaji] ([[Himachal]])
* [[Taratarini Temple|Tara Tarini]] ([[Brahmapur, Odisha|Brahmapur]], [[Odisha]])
* [[Katyayani]] ([[Chhatarpur Temple|Chattarpur]], [[Delhi]])
* [[Bhadrakali]] ([[Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple|Kodungallur]], [[Kerala]])
* [[Kamakhya]] (Assam)
* [[Kali]] at [[Kalighat]] ([[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]])
*[http://www.nainadevi.com/ Naina Devi Temple] ([[Uttarakhand]])
* [[Guhyeshwari Temple]] [[Devi]] ([[Kathmandu, Nepal]])
* [[Ambaji]] ([[Gujarat]])
* [[Vishalakshi Temple]] ([[Varanasi]])
* [[Chandranath Temple]] ([[Sitakunda]], [[Bangladesh]])

Other pithas in [[Maharashtra]] are:
* [[Tuljapur]] ([[Tulja Bhavani|Jagdamba]])
* [[Kolhapur]] ([[Laxmi|Mahalaxmi]])
* [[Nashik|vani-Nashik]] ([[Saptashrungi]])
* [[Mahur, Maharashtra|Mahurgadh]] ([[Renuka]]mata)

==Bhajans and mantras==
There are many ancient Shakti devotional songs and vibrational chants in the Hindu and Sikh traditions (found in [[Sarbloh Granth]]). The recitation of the Sanskrit mantras is commonly used to call upon the Divine Mother.

'''Kundalini-Shakti-Bhakti Mantra'''

:Adi Shakti, Adi Shakti, Adi Shakti, Namo Namo!
:Sarab Shakti, Sarab Shakti, Sarab Shakti, Namo Namo!
:Prithum Bhagvati, Prithum Bhagvati, Prithum Bhagvati, Namo Namo!
:Kundalini Mata Shakti, Mata Shakti, Namo Namo!

Translation:

:''Primal Shakti, I bow to Thee!''
:''All-Encompassing Shakti, I bow to Thee!''
:''That through which Divine Creates, I bow to Thee!''
:''Creative Power of the Kundalini, Mother of all Mother Power, To Thee I Bow!''&lt;ref&gt;Yogi Bhajan as quoted in the ''Conscious Pregnancy Yoga Teacher's Manual'' by Tarn Tarn Kaur, Espanola, New Mexico p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

"Merge in the Maha Shakti. This is enough to take away your misfortune.
This will carve out of you a woman. Woman needs her own Shakti, not anybody else will do it... When a woman chants the Kundalini Bhakti mantra, God clears the way. This is not a religion, it is a reality. Woman is not born to suffer, and woman needs her own power."

:~ Yogi Bhajan (Harbhajan Singh)&lt;ref&gt;Yogi Bhajan as quoted in the ''Conscious Pregnancy Yoga Teacher's Manual'' by Tarn Tarn Kaur, Espanola, New Mexico&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sky Kingdom''' ({{lang-ms|Kerajaan Langit}}) is the name of the religious [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] and [[sect]] founded by [[Ariffin Mohammed]] in Malaysia. The commune, based in [[Besut]], [[Terengganu]], was demolished by the government of Malaysia in August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Levett, Connie|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/bulldozers-etch-boundaries-of-religious-freedom/2005/08/19/1124435143759.html|title=Bulldozers etch boundaries of religious freedom|publisher=The Age|date=20 August 2005|accessdate=26 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, Ariffin Mohamed was residing in exile in [[Narathiwat]], Thailand, just over the border from Kelantan. Eighteen members of the Sky Kingdom commune remain at the mercy of the Malaysia's Higher Shariah Court, with 40 having received leniency upon renouncing the group.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzJbWUjSfyA&lt;/ref&gt;

Sky Kingdom attracted worldwide mass media attention in mid-2005, over concerns about efforts by the Malaysian government to suppress its followers as [[apostasy|apostates]] from [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4648581.stm|title=Malaysian sect members arrested|publisher=BBC News|date=4 July 2005|accessdate=26 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[controversy]] brought to light the issue of whether [[sharia|sharia law]] superseded the right to [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]] under Article 11 of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]]. This attention was coupled with considerable bemusement over followers' central objects of veneration, which include a large cream-coloured teapot,&lt;ref name="mkini" /&gt; prompting local and foreign media to dub the sect as the "teapot cult".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30000-13388811,00.html|title=Teapot Cult Under Attack|publisher=Sky News|accessdate=26 December 2007|date=18 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sky Kingdom commune==
The {{convert|6|acre|ha|adj=on}}, 33-building complex was located near the village of Kampung Batu 13, Hulu Besut, in the [[Besut]] district in northern [[Terengganu]] (some 400&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Kuala Lumpur]] and 20&amp;nbsp;km from [[Jerteh]]). Sky Kingdom had existed on the site since the mid-1980s, though the group itself dates back to the late 1970s. Before the commune was demolished, the group supported itself through rubber tapping, religious tourism, and confectionery production.

===Following===
The Malaysian government has described the "teapot cult" of Sky Kingdom as one of 22 "heretical" Islamic "sects" or "cults" in Malaysia, which altogether have an estimated 22,800 adherents.

Most estimates of the numbers of followers of Sky Kingdom put them at several thousand, though this number would heavily depend on the criteria used for inclusion. As few as 25 now live on the commune, down from about 120 prior to the demolitions. Followers are mostly [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]] but also include Africans, Indians, and British believers. One adherent is from New Zealand. Besides Malaysia, members are also said to be located in Singapore and [[Bali]].

===Beliefs and practices===
A Muslim by birth, Ariffin, also known as ''Ayah Pin'' (''Ayah'' is a common honorific meaning "father"), claims to have direct contact with the heavens and is believed by his followers to be the reincarnation of Jesus, [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Shiva]], and [[Muhammad]]. Devotees of Sky Kingdom believe that one day, Ayah Pin will return as the [[Mahdi|Imam Mahdi]]. His followers consider him the king of the sky, and the supreme object of devotion for all religions.

A major emphasis of the Sky Kingdom religion is [[ecumenical]] dialogue and inter-religious harmony. People of different religious backgrounds have joined. Ayah Pin has visited several [[Hindu]] temples and the group once hosted a visit by a Christian group, a rare move by Malaysian standards  {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}.

Ayah Pin accepts the existence of [[angels]], as well as a class of Malaysian forest fairies, called [[Orang Bunian]]. The Sky Kingdom also emphasizes the importance of [[spiritual healing]] as well as [[dream interpretation]].

Ayah Pin used to conduct "sessions" on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings. According to a witness, the sessions began with a special ritual whereby followers would usher Ayah Pin from the main building to a concrete boat in the compound in which he would lie. His followers would then start chanting for him until 4:00 am.&lt;ref name=rnb&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Religion News Blog|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/11638|title=Ayah Pin Followers Wary of More Raids|date=11 July 2005|accessdate=26 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this ritual, a lengthy question-and-answer period would take place, with Ayah Pin seated on a dais facing an audience. Hymns would also be sung during the session.

===Symbols===
The commune features some structures which are symbolic of the group's ideology. Some notable symbols include a two-story high cream coloured teapot&lt;ref name=mkini&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Malaysiakini.com|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/pages/ayah_pin/|title=Ayah Pin's Sky Kingdom (gallery)|author=Theophilus, Claudia|accessdate=26 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a similarly-sized blue vase, costing [[Malaysian ringgit|RM]] 45 million. The teapot is said to [[symbol]]ise the purity of water and "love pouring from heaven". It is the earthly model of a celestial prototype. According to Ayah Pin, it was inspired by the dreams of one of his followers, and reflects a similar vessel in the sky which God uses to shower his blessings on mankind.&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/10448/sect-where-blessings-pour-from-a-teapot|title=Sect where blessings pour from a teapot|date=5 March 2005|accessdate=26 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followers who visits the commune for the first time have to drink "holy water" from the vase which is "perpetually" filled by the teapot.&lt;ref name="smh" /&gt;

Another notable feature in the compound is an equally large yellow umbrella,&lt;ref name="mkini" /&gt; which offers "a place for people to take shelter beneath God." It is said that this can also be associated with the nine planets in Hinduism."&lt;ref name=apologetics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apologeticsindex.org/s/s53.html|title=Sky Kingdom|accessdate=26 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other symbols present include an ornamental fishing boat,&lt;ref name="mkini" /&gt; identified with [[Noah's Ark]], and a crescent moon icon&lt;ref name="mkini" /&gt; symbolising people without a religion, including the [[Orang Asli]] (indigenous peoples of peninsular Malaysia) and the aforementioned [[Orang Bunian]].&lt;ref name="apologetics" /&gt;

==History==
Ariffin the leader and founder of Sky Kingdom, was born in 1943 in Beris, Kampung Besar Bachok, [[Kelantan]]. In 1953, Ariffin became seriously ill and he claimed that an angel had visited him. Twenty years later, the angel returned and Ariffin began his spiritual career. In 1975 a spiritual group was formed in Bagan Lebai Tahir, [[Butterworth, Penang]]. Whether Ariffin was the founder is unclear; during this phase he may have been a follower of [[Hassan Tuhan]] (also known as Anak Rimau), another claimant to divinity.

In the mid-1980s, the Sky Kingdom commune was formed on its present site in Besut. Some reports state the Office of Islamic Affairs declared the group to be deviant at this time. In 1995, Sky Kingdom's signature building projects began, in accordance with divine revelation. Two years later, the local Religious Affairs Council (''Jawatankuasa Fatwa Majlis Agama Islam dan Adat Melayu Terengganu'') issued a [[fatwa]] against the group. About this time, four adherents were arrested for the crime of renouncing [[Islam]], but they were later freed since as ex-Muslims Malaysia's [[sharia]] court no longer has jurisdiction over them.

In 2001 Ariffin himself renounced Islam. The Sharia court accused him of contravening Section 25 of the ''Enakmen Pentadbiran Hal Ehwal Agama Islam 1986'' (Administration of Islamic Religious Affairs 1986), stating that his teachings and beliefs were "false, deviant, corrupting and threatening to the public peace" (''membawa ancaman kepada ketenteraman orang awam serta merosakkan akidah''). He pleaded guilty to a charge of "belittling Islam" (''menghina Islam''), and was jailed for 11 months and fined RM 2,900. The Religious Affairs Office hoped that Ariffin's arrest would prevent the movement's growth. However, the Sky Kingdom continued to attract new followers from university students and [[Orang Asli]].&lt;ref name=thesun&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Sun, Malaysia|title=Pie in the sky (Feature and interview)|url=http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=10057|accessdate=26 December 2007|date=8 July 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219062618/http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=10057|archivedate=19 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July 2005, a group of masked vigilantes attacked the group's headquarters, smashing windows and torching buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Sun, Malaysia|url=http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=10213|title=Masked group attacks Ayah Pin commune|accessdate=26 December 2007|date=18 July 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912033201/http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=10213|archivedate=12 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, 58 Sky Kingdom followers were arrested,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Sun, Malaysia|date=21 July 2005|url=http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=10254|title=58 followers of Ayah Pin arrested|accessdate=26 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912190159/http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=10254|archivedate=12 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 31 July three of Ariffin's four wives were arrested in [[Kelantan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Bernama|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/11861/three-wives-of-ayah-pin-detained|date= 31 July 2005|accessdate=26 December 2007|title=Three Wives of Ayah Pin Detained}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ariffin escaped capture and remains at large. Forty-five of his followers face the charge of failing to observe the government [[fatwa]] by continuing to be "members of a sect declared deviant", which carries a fine up to RM 3,000 or two years in prison. One of those arrested faced an additional charge of "humiliating Islam" for claiming no longer to be a Muslim. 

Court cases will revolve around the right of religious freedom, which is theoretically guaranteed by the Malaysian constitution.

On 1 August 2005, officials of the Besut Land Office destroyed Sky Kingdom's buildings, citing Section 129 of the National Land Code, which punishes unauthorised construction with land confiscation. The titular landowner is Ariffin's first wife, who failed to appear in court for a hearing on the ownership. At a 1 September 2005, hearing, a trial date for the 45 followers accused of violating the government fatwa was set for three days beginning 18 December. All of the accused are represented by Wan Haidi Wan Jusoh of Ubaidullah Aziz and Company, who unsuccessfully petitioned the court to order his name blacked out by the media. The Sky Kingdom had previously had great difficulty obtaining legal representation, presumably because of attorneys' fears of reprisals or negative publicity.&lt;ref name=nst&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New Straits Times|date=1 September 2005|accessdate=26 December 2007|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/12121/lawyer-to-represent-all-45-sky-kingdom-sect-followers|title=Lawyer to represent all 45 Sky Kingdom sect followers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, after wide media coverage, the original Hulu Besut commune, now containing only 24 members, had reportedly chosen a new leader—a former police chief inspector in his 30s. The group is suspicious of visitors, and routinely turns out the commune's lights when a car approaches at night so as not to be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Harian Metro|language=Malay|accessdate=26 December 2007|url=http://www.carigold.com/portal/forums/showthread.php?t=9060|title=Pemimpin baru 'Kerajaan Langit'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tartaruchi''' (singular: ''tartaruchus'', meaning "holder of Tartarus") are the keepers of [[Tartarus]] ([[hell]]), according to the 4th century, [[Biblical canon|non-canonical]] ''[[Apocalypse of Paul]]''.  The author describes them as using one hand to choke damned souls, and the other using an "[[trident|iron of three hooks]]".  [[Temeluchus]] is the only tartaruchus named in the work. Tarturachus is mentioned in the Vision of Saint Paul in chapters 16 and 18 "...Let him therefore be delivered unto the angel Tartaruchus that is set over the torments, and let him cast him into the outer darkness where is weeping and gnashing of teeth... [...] ...And I heard a voice saying: Let that soul be delivered into the hands of Tartaruchus, and he must be taken down into hell...".&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20060104124542/http://www.comparative-religion.com/christianity/apocrypha/new-testament-apocrypha/4/5.php (accessed 12 April 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; The Tartaruchi are also mentioned in 2 [[Meqabyan]] (12:13) "...And before he had finished saying this, the Angels of Death - whose name are called the Thilimyakos [Tartaruchi] - alit and struck him in the heart, dead..."

The Italian and Portuguese word ''[[tartaruga (disambiguation)|tartaruga]]'' ("turtle" or "tortoise") derives from this noun, as may English ''tortoise'' and ''turtle''.

'''''The Master Gunfighter''''' is a film released in 1975 in [[Panavision]], written and produced by [[Tom Laughlin (actor)|Tom Laughlin]], who also played the lead as Finley. ''The Master Gunfighter'' is mainly a remake of the 1969 Japanese film ''[[Goyokin]]'', although the story revolves around a true incident in the early 1800s involving massacred Indians that occurred in the vicinity of [[Goleta, California]].

==Plot==
In 1836 in southern [[California]] near [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] shortly after California became part of the United States, American settlers and the U.S. government discriminated against the Mexican landowners and frequently took their land by force or legal skullduggery. Wealthy [[Latino]] ranchers whose land and wealth are at risk decide to misdirect a U.S. government ship carrying gold so that it will be wrecked and plundered. To prevent themselves from being caught, they plan to massacre the local [[Chumash (tribe)|Chumash]] Indians. The hero is the now-estranged adoptive son Finley ([[Tom Laughlin]]), a master swordsman and gunfighter, who tries to prevent this while still saving his family.

==Cast==
* [[Tom Laughlin]] as Finley 
* [[Ron O'Neal]] as Paulo 
* [[Lincoln Kilpatrick]] as Jacques 
* Geo Anne Sosa as Chorika 
* [[Barbara Carrera]] as Eula 
* Victor Campos as Maltese 
* Hector Elias as Juan 
* [[Burgess Meredith]] as Narrator

The director was Tom Laughlin, but officially the director credited was his son Frank (in 1975 he was 9).

==Critical reception==
Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] was harsh in his criticism of the film, writing, "The movie opens with a long-winded narration, in a hapless attempt to orient us, but not long afterward the narrator has to break in again—we're lost already. It's all to little avail. I don't think there's any way an intelligent moviegoer could sit through this mess and accurately describe the plot afterward."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-master-gunfighter |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=The Master Gunfighter |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=January 1, 1975 |accessdate=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine was also critical, writing, "The film could have worked but for an excess of formula ingredients and muddled preachings. Adapted from a Japanese film, the transposition dubiously retains much samurai swordfighting and semi-Oriental costumes. Meanwhile, the over-mannered camerawork pays its dues to the Italian Western. In the resulting cultural hash, the plot with its strong anti-religious theme is too often disregarded."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/the-master-gunfighter |title=The Master Gunfighter |author=CPe |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |accessdate=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tilopa.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Tilopa.]]
'''Tilopa''' ([[Prakrit]]; [[Sanskrit]]: '''Talika''' or ''Tilopada'') (988–1069) was born in either Chativavo ([[Chittagong]]), [[Bengal]] or Jagora, [[Bengal]] in India. He was a [[tantra|tantric practitioner]] and [[mahasiddha]]. He practiced [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]], a set of spiritual practices intended to accelerate the process of attaining [[Buddhahood]]. [[Naropa]] is considered his main student. At [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]] temple premise, greatest [[Hindu]]  shrine of [[Nepal]], there are two caves where Tilopa attained [[Siddhi]] and initiated his disciple [[Naropa]].

==Life==
Tilopa was born into the priestly [[caste]] – according to some sources, a royal family – but he adopted the [[monastery|monastic life]] upon receiving orders from a [[dakini]] (female buddha whose activity is to inspire practitioners) who told him to adopt a [[mendicant]] and [[itinerant minister|itinerant]] existence. From the beginning, she made it clear to Tilopa that his real parents were not the persons who had raised him, but instead were primordial wisdom and universal voidness. Advised by the dakini, Tilopa gradually took up a monk's life, taking the monastic vows and becoming an erudite scholar. The frequent visits of his dakini teacher continued to guide his spiritual path and close the gap to enlightenment.&lt;ref name="kagyu"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Mahasiddha-Tilopa-Chos-Kyi-Blo-Gros-Marpa/dp/8185102910/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347265919&amp;sr=1-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords=The+life+of+the+Mah%26%23257%3Bsiddha+Tilopa The Life of the Mahasiddha Tilopa by Chos-Kyi Blo-Gros Marpa]&lt;/ref&gt;

He began to travel throughout India, receiving teachings from many gurus:

* from [[Saryapa]] he learned of [[tummo|inner heat]] (Sanskrit: ''caṇḍalī'', Tib. ''tummo'', inner heat);
* from [[Nagarjuna]] he received the [[Ösel (yoga)|radiant light]] (Sanskrit:  ''[[prabashvara]]'') and [[Six Yogas of Naropa#Pure illusory body|illusory body]] (Sanskrit:  ''maya deha'', Tib. ''gyulu'') teachings (''[[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra]]''), [[Lagusamvara tantra]], or Heruka [[Abhidharma]]);
* from [[Lawapa]], the [[dream yoga]];
* from [[Sukhasiddhi]], the teachings on life, death, and the [[bardo]] (between life states, and consciousness transference) ([[phowa]]);
* from [[Indrabhuti]], he learned of [[wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]] (''prajña'');
* and from [[Matangi]], the resurrection of the dead body.

As advised by Matangi, Tilopa started to work at a brothel in Bengal for a prostitute called Dharima as her solicitor and bouncer. During the day, he was grinding sesame seeds for his living.&lt;ref name="kagyu2"&gt;[http://www.kagyu.org/kagyulineage/lineage/kag02.php Kagyu Lineage History: Tilopa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228050913/http://www.kagyu.org/kagyulineage/lineage/kag02.php |date=28 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a meditation, he received a vision of [[Vajradhara]] and, according to legend, the entirety of [[mahamudra]] was directly transmitted to Tilopa. After having received the transmission, Tilopa embarked on a wandering existence and started to teach. He appointed [[Naropa]], his most important student, as his successor.&lt;ref name="kagyu"/&gt;

==Teachings==
[[File:Mahasiddha Tilopa, southern Tibet, 16th-17th century AD, bronze - Linden-Museum - Stuttgart, Germany - DSC03693.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Mahasiddha Tilopa, southern Tibet, 16th-17th century AD, bronze - Linden-Museum - Stuttgart, Germany.]]
===Six Precepts or Words of Advice===
Tilopa gave [[Naropa]] a teaching called the Six Words of Advice, the original [[Sanskrit]] or [[Bengali language|Bengali]] of which is not extant; the text has reached us in [[Tibet]]an translation. In Tibetan, the teaching is called ''gnad kyi gzer drug''&lt;ref&gt;[[Tsele Natsok Rangdröl]] (tr. Erik Pema Kunsang), [https://www.amazon.com/Lamp-Mahamudra-Immaculate-Perfectly-Illuminates/dp/9627341312 ''Lamp of Mahamudra: The Immaculate Lamp that Perfectly and Fully Illuminates The Meaning of Mahamudra, The Essence of All Phenomena'', Boston &amp; Shaftesbury: Shambhala, 1989], p. 72 and n. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; – literally, "six nails of key points" – the aptness of which title becomes clear if one considers the meaning of the English idiomatic expression, "to hit the nail on the head.”

According to [[Ken McLeod]], the text contains exactly six words; the two English translations given in the following table are both attributed to him.

&lt;br&gt;
'''Watts-Wayman translation'''&lt;br&gt;

An earlier translation circa 1957 by [[Alan Watts]] and Dr. [[Alex Wayman]] rendered Tilopa's "Six Precepts" as&lt;br&gt;
:No thought, no reflection, no analysis,&lt;br&gt;
:No cultivation, no intention;&lt;br&gt;
:Let it settle itself.&lt;br&gt;

In a footnote, Watts cited a Tibetan source text at partial variance with McLeod's in sequence and syntax, namely:&lt;br&gt;
:''Mi-mno, mi-bsam, mi-dpyad-ching,''&lt;br&gt;
:''Mi-bsgom, mi-sems, rang-babs-bzhag.''&lt;br&gt;

Based on an "elucidation" provided by Wayman, Watts explained that&lt;br&gt;
:''Mi-mno'' is approximately equivalent to the Zen terms ''wu-hsin'' or ''wu-nien'', “no-mind” or “no thought.” ''Bsam'' is the equivalent of the Sanskrit ''cintana'', i.e., discursive thinking about what has been heard, and ''dpyad'' of ''mimamsa'', or “philosophical analysis.” ''Bsgom'' is probably ''bhavana'' or the Chinese ''hsiu'', “to cultivate,” “to practice,” or “intense concentration.” ''Sems'' is ''cetana'' or ''szu'', with the sense of intention or volition. ''Rang-babs-bzhag'' is literally “self-settle-establish,” and “self-settle” would seem to be an almost exact equivalent of the Taoist ''tzu-jan'', “self-so,” “spontaneous,” or “natural.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Way of Zen'' by Alan Watts (© Pantheon NY, 1957), Vintage Books paperback 1999, p. 79 and n. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Watts had studied Chinese, and Wayman was a Tibetologist and professor of Sanskrit associated with UCLA and later Columbia University.

===Mahamudra instructions===
Tilopa also gave [[mahamudra]] instruction to [[Naropa]] by means of the song known as "The Ganges Mahamudra,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Tilopa-Ganges-Mahamudra/dp/1877294225 "The Life of Tilopa and the Ganges Mahamudra"]&lt;/ref&gt; one stanza of which reads:

:The fool in his ignorance, disdaining [[Mahamudra]],
:Knows nothing but struggle in the flood of samsara.
:Have compassion for those who suffer constant anxiety!
:Sick of unrelenting pain and desiring release, adhere to a master,
:For when his blessing touches your heart, the mind is liberated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keithdowman.net/mahamudra/tilopa.htm Keith Dowman / Tilopa's Instruction to Naropa&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attachment and enjoyment===
One of the most famous and important statements attributed to Tilopa is: “The problem is not enjoyment; the problem is attachment.”{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Upsherin.jpg|thumb|Upsherin celebration of Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai]], by Rabbi [[Eliezer Shlomo Schick]]]]
'''Upsherin''', '''Opsherin''' or '''Upsherinish''' ([[Yiddish]]: אפשערן, lit. "shear off", [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judaeo-Arabic]]: חלאקה, ''ḥalāqah''&lt;ref&gt;[[Shem Tob Gaguine]], ''Keter Shem Tob'' volume 2 page 591.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[First haircut|haircutting ceremony]] observed by a wide cross-section of Jews and is particularly popular in [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] [[Judaism|Jewish communities]]. It is typically held when a [[boy]] turns three years old. Among those who practice the upsherin, the male infant does not have his hair cut until this ceremony.  

== Background ==
The upsherin tradition is a relatively modern custom in Judaism and has only become a popular practice since the 17th century.

Yoram Bilu, a professor of anthropology and psychology at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], suggests that there is little or no religious basis for the custom and its popularity is probably mainly social. The following are some quotes from his paper,&lt;ref&gt;"From Milah (Circumcision) to Milah (Word): Male Identity and Rituals of Childhood in the Jewish Ultraorthodox Community" (Ethos 31 (2): 172-203 published by the American Anthropological Association in 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Two disparate hair-related practices appear to have converged in the haircutting ritual: the growing of ear-locks [[payot]]h - s.d.] and the shearing of the head hair. ... Ritual haircut, probably modeled on the Muslim custom of shaving male children's hair in saints' sanctuaries, was practiced by native Palestinian Jews ([[Musta'arabi Jews|Musta'arbim]]) as early as the Middle Ages. Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]] Ashkenazi, the 16th-century founder of the celebrated Lurianic School of [[Kabbalah]] who assigned special mystical value to the ear-locks, was instrumental in constituting the ritual in its present form. The ritual remained primarily a Sephardi custom following Luria, but in the last 200 years it became widespread among East European Hasidim. From Palestine it spread to the Diaspora communities, where it was usually celebrated in a more modest family
setting.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rabbi [[Chaim Vital]] wrote in Sha'ar Ha-Kavanot that "[[Isaac Luria]], cut his son's hair on [[Lag BaOmer]], according to the well-known custom." However, the age of his son is not mentioned. An obvious problem raised by Avraham Yaari, in an article in Tarbiz 22 (1951), is that many sources cite that Luria held one should not cut one's hair for the entire [[Counting of the Omer|sefirah]] – including Lag BaOmer, (see Shaarei Teshuva, O.C. 493, 8). 

We know from travellers that by the 18th and 19th centuries, the ''hilula'' at Meron on [[Lag BaOmer]] with bonfires and the cutting of children's hair had by then become an affair of the masses. A well-known [[Talmud]] scholar from Bulgaria, [[Rabbi]] Abraham ben Israel Rosanes, wrote that, in his visit to Palestine in 1867, he saw an [[Ashkenazi]] Jew giving his son a haircut at the hilula. R. Rosanes says that he could not restrain himself, and went to the Jew and tried to dissuade him, yet was unsuccessful; he also complained that most of the [[Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi]] Jews of Israel were participating in this "insanity," with "drinking and dancing and fires."

A [[Hasidic]] rebbe, R. Yehudah Leibush Horenstein, who emigrated to Palestine in the middle of the 19th century, writes that "this haircut, called ''halaqe'', is done by the Sephardim in [[Jerusalem]] at the [[Mausoleum|tomb]] of Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai]] during the summer, but during the winter they take the boy to the [[synagogue]] or Beit Midrash and perform the haircut with great celebration and parties, something unknown to the Jews in Europe."

== Customs ==
Some [[Haredi]] rabbis, among them [[Rabbi]] [[Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky]] (the Steipler) and [[Rabbi]] [[Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik]] opposed the practice on various grounds, but it is popular among [[Hasidic Jews]] and has spread in recent years to other Jewish groups.&lt;ref&gt;see discussion http://listserv.shamash.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0601&amp;L=MAIL-JEWISH&amp;P=2067&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hasidic]] community, the ''upsherin'' marks a male child's entry into the formal educational system and the commencement of Torah study. A [[yarmulke]] and [[Tzitzit|tzitzis]] will now be worn, and the child will be taught to pray and read the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. So that Torah should be "sweet on the tongue," the Hebrew letters are covered with honey, and the children lick them as they read.&lt;ref&gt;http://rchaimqoton.blogspot.com/2006/05/sweet-transformation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the hair that is cut off in the ''upsherin'' ceremony is weighed, and charity is given in that amount. If the hair is long enough, it may be donated to a charity that makes wigs for cancer patients. Other customs include having each of those attending the ceremony snip off a lock of hair, and encouraging the child to put a penny in a [[tzedakah]] box for each lock, as it is cut. Sometimes the child sings a Hebrew song based on the Biblical verse: "Torah tzivah lanu Moshe, morashah kehilat Yaakov" ["[[Moses]] commanded the Torah to us, an eternal heritage for the congregation of [[Jacob]]" ([[Deuteronomy|Deut]] 33:4).

Among some Hasidic sects, such as [[Skver (Hasidic dynasty)|Skver]], [[Chernobyl]], and [[Gur (Hasidic dynasty)|Gur]], the upsherin is held at age two.&lt;ref&gt;http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46552&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=35&lt;/ref&gt; This custom is based on the tradition that [[Abraham]] celebrated his son Isaac's second birthday, hinted at in the Biblical verse: "The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham made a great feast." (Genesis 21:8) Among some sephardic communities, particularly in Jerusalem, the practice (known to them as "chalaka") is performed at age five.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/2170624/jewish/First-Haircut.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lag BaOmer upsherins ===
{{main|Lag BaOmer}}
Cutting hair is not allowed during the time of the [[Counting of the Omer]] but is permitted on [[Lag BaOmer]]. This is why boys who turned three between [[Pesach]] and Lag BaOmer celebrate upsherin on this date. It is customary that at the Lag BaOmer celebrations by the tomb of Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai]] in [[Meron, Israel]], boys are given their first haircuts while their parents distribute wine and sweets. Similar upsherin celebrations are simultaneously held in Jerusalem at the grave of [[Simeon the Just|Shimon Hatzaddik]] for Jerusalemites who cannot travel to Meron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishmag.com/10mag/israel/israel.htm |title=Meron on Lag B'Omer |last=Rossoff |first=Dovid |accessdate=2010-04-28 |publisher=The Jewish Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 Rabbi [[Levi Yitzchak Horowitz]], the second [[Boston (Hasidic dynasty)|Bostoner]] Rebbe, reinstated a century-old tradition among Bostoner Hasidim to light a bonfire and conduct upsherins near the grave of [[Rabbi Akiva]] in [[Tiberias]] on Lag BaOmer night. The tradition had been abandoned due to murderous attacks on sojourners to that relatively isolated place.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Y. F. and Morgenstern, Ashira (24 November 2010). "Seasons: The Bostoner Rebbetzin remembers and reflects on the occasion of the first yahrtzeit of Grand Rabbi Levi Yitzchak HaLevi Horowitz, ztz"l, 18 Kislev 5771". ''[[Mishpacha]]'', Family First supplement, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hasidic interpretation toward Biblical allusion ==

In the Bible, human life is sometimes compared to the growth of trees.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Deuteronomy]] 20:19, [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 65:22, [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 17:8&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Leviticus]] 19:23, one is [[Orlah prohibition|not permitted]] to eat the fruit that grows on a tree for the first three years. Some Jews apply this principle to cutting a child's hair. Thus little boys are not given their first haircut until the age of three. To continue the analogy, it is hoped that the child, like a tree that grows tall and eventually produces fruit, will grow in knowledge and good deeds, and someday have a family of his own.  Hasidic Rabbis have made this comparison, and in some communities a boy before his first haircut is referred to as ''orlah'', as we refer to a tree in its early years.

[[Chabad]] Hasidim have another explanation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/710724/jewish/The-Basics-of-the-Upsherin.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the first three years of life, a child absorbs the surrounding sights and sounds and the parents’ loving care. The child is a receiver, not yet ready to give. At the age of three, children’s education takes a leap—they are now ready to produce and share their unique gifts."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
