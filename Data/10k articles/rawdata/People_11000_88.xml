'''Alexander Petrovitch Kazantsev''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Петро́вич Каза́нцев}}; 2 September 1906 – 13 September 2002) was a popular Soviet [[science fiction]] writer, [[ufologist]] and [[chess composer]].

==Biography==
Born in Akmolinsk, Imperial Russia (modern [[Astana]] in [[Kazakhstan]]). He graduated from [[Tomsk Polytechnic University]], and worked at the Soviet Research Institute of Electromechanics. Kazantsev was a member of the Soviet delegation at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Kazantsev joined the army. He left military service in 1945 with the rank of [[Polkovnik|colonel]], and was awarded a number of orders, including [[Order of the Patriotic War]] and [[Order of the Red Star]]. From then on, Kazantsev settled in the "literary village" of [[Peredelkino]] and concentrated on his writings. He survived the dissolution of the Soviet Union and died in 2002.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Writings==
Kazantsev was an enthusiast of the unknown, and a pioneer of Soviet [[UFOlogy]]. Many of his works, both fiction and non-fiction, deal with controversial parascientific (or pseudoscientific) theories.

He researched the [[Tunguska event]] and published a number of science fiction, as well as [[popular science]] books, on the topic. He believed the Tunguska impact was caused by an alien spacecraft that crash-landed on the Earth.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Kazantsev researched events and legends that he believed were evidences of [[paleocontact]]s with extraterrestrials. His novel ''Phaetae'' is based on the hypothetical planet [[Phaeton (hypothetical planet)|Phaeton]] that some believe existed in the orbit of modern [[Asteroid belt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lib.ru/RUFANT/KAZANCEW/kazantsev_faety-engl.txt_with-big-pictures.html#|title=Alexander Kazantsev. The Destruction of Faena|website=www.lib.ru|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Iz5BWPscCMC|title=Acorns: Windows High-Tide Foghat|last=Morris|first=Joshua|date=2013-01-23|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781475966954|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the novel, Phaeton was inhabited by a developed civilisation of the ''phaetae'' race, who survived the destruction of their planet and brought some of their culture to the prehistorical people of Earth.

Kazantsev was also interested in the [[Martian canal]] theory, and used it in his fiction concerning Mars.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

He was also a composer of chess [[endgame study|endgame studies]]. In 1975 he was awarded by the [[Permanent Commission of the FIDE for Chess Compositions]] (PCCC) the title of International Master of Composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INTERNATIONAL MASTERS OF THE FIDE FOR CHESS COMPOSITIONS|url=http://www.wfcc.ch/1999-2012/im/|website=[[World Federation for Chess Composition]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allen Gee''' (6 September 1852 &amp;ndash; 12 August 1939) was a [[British people|British]] [[trade unionist]] and [[politician]].

==Professional background==
Gee worked in the woollen industry in [[Huddersfield]], and was involved in a major, but unsuccessful, strike in 1883.  This experience inspired him to found what became the [[General Union of Textile Workers]], with membership from the wider district.  In 1885, he was elected as the first president of the Huddersfield [[Trades Council]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2010/09/23/big-anniversary-for-huddersfield-trades-union-council-86081-27323459/ Big anniversary for Huddersfield Trades Union Council]", ''[[Huddersfield Daily Examiner]]'', 23 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a strong supporter of the Weavers' campaign for an [[eight-hour day]], launched in 1886, and was involved in the [[Manningham Mills Strike]].&lt;ref&gt;J. F. C. Harrison, ''Learning and living, 1790-1960'', p.253&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1888, he was elected as General Secretary of the West Yorkshire Power-Loom Weavers Association (later to become the Textile Workers), a position which he held until 1922.&lt;ref name="clegg"&gt;[[Hugh Armstrong Clegg]], ''A History of British Trade Unions Since 1889: 1889-1910'', p.184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Pimlott and Chris Cook, ''Trade unions in British politics: the first 250 years'', p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unions==
Gee attended the founding conference of the [[Independent Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;David Howell, ''British Workers and the Independent Labour Party, 1888-1906'', p.331&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon elected as an independent labour member of Huddersfield Town Council, although the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] attempted to claim that he was a supporter of their group.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Laybourn and Jack Reynolds, ''Liberalism and the Rise of Labour, 1890-1918'', p.114&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1900, he was elected to the first Executive of the [[British Labour Party|Labour Representation Committee]] (LRC), and he was also appointed as one of the organisation's first trustees.&lt;ref&gt;A. W. Humphrey, ''[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924002657538/cu31924002657538_djvu.txt A History of Labour Representation]'', pp.147, 156&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as the second Chairman of the [[National Executive Committee]], in 1901, although he did not chair the annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Jefferys, ''Leading Labour: From Keir Hardie to Tony Blair'', p.4&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1910 until 1912, he was chairman of the [[General Federation of Trade Unions (UK)|General Federation of Trade Unions]],&lt;ref name="clegg" /&gt; while at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 general election]], he stood unsuccessfully for the Labour Party in [[Blackpool (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackpool]].

In later life, Gee became a [[Justice of the Peace]], and remained close to his fellow trade unionist [[Ben Turner (politician)|Ben Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Turner, ''About Myself'', p.334&lt;/ref&gt;  When the Huddersfield Trades Council celebrated its fiftieth anniversary, in 1935, Gee marched at the head of the celebratory parade.&lt;ref&gt;''Labour'', Vol. 2, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andre Cornelius Botha''' (born 12 September 1975) is a former Irish cricketer. He played 55 times in all for Ireland, including the [[2005 ICC Trophy]] and the [[European Cricket Championship|European Championship]] in 2004 and 2006. Botha retired in May 2011.

== Domestic career ==
A left-handed [[batsman]] and right-arm medium pace [[Bowler (cricket)|bowler]], Botha played provincial cricket for [[Griqualand West]] in his native [[Republic of South Africa|South Africa]].

Botha was the resident professional at [[Clontarf Cricket Club]] from 1994 until his switch to [http://www.northcountycricketclub.net North County] in 2000. A prolific batsman at club level, Botha contributed to North County's [[Irish Senior Cup (cricket)|Irish Senior Cup]] victories in 2001, 2003,2005 and 2007 as well as garnering four consecutive [[Leinster Senior League (cricket)|Leinster Senior League]] winners' medals between 2003 and 2006.

== International career ==
Esteemed among the leading [[all-rounder]]s in domestic cricket, the newly-eligible Botha débuted  for his adopted country in Ireland's August 2001 [[C&amp;G Trophy]] victory over [[Wiltshire County Cricket Club|Wiltshire]], although he started inauspiciously, registering nought with the bat and 1–50 with the ball.&lt;ref name="Record"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketeurope4.net/DATABASE/ARTICLES/articles/000054/005448.shtml |author=John Eoomer |title=Botha rewrites the record books |publisher= |date=2007-08-14 |accessdate=2007-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416045407/http://www.cricketeurope4.net/DATABASE/ARTICLES/articles/000054/005448.shtml |archivedate=16 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fixture in the Irish team thereafter, Botha's form temporarily deserted him during Ireland's momentous summer of 2005. Selected at #3 in the [[Batting order (cricket)|batting order]] throughout the group phase of the [[2005 ICC Trophy]], Botha recorded a dismal [[batting average|average]] of 9.5 for the tournament, twice succumbing on zero. However, his economical bowling contributed eight wickets to the Irish cause, and helped the team (which ultimately finished second in the competition) land a qualifying berth for the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]].

In marked contrast to his ICC Trophy form, the runs flowed freely from Botha's bat during Ireland's conquest of the [[2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup]]. A tournament average of 66.00 encompassed an international career-best 97 against the [[Dutch cricket team|Netherlands]] at [[Stormont (cricket ground)|Stormont]], and knocks of 78 and 43* in the final victory over [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]] at [[Windhoek]]. Botha also accounted for eight wickets at 25.50 with his medium-paced bowling during the course of the tournament.

Selected for Ireland's inaugural [[One Day International]] against [[English cricket team|England]] at Stormont despite a series of low scores in the preceding C&amp;G Trophy matches, Botha vindicated the selectors' judgement by top-scoring with 52 against a first-rate attack including [[Steve Harmison]], [[Liam Plunkett]] and [[Sajid Mahmood]]. Since then, Botha has evinced a marked aptitude for One Day Internationals, averaging 39.66 in three ODIs to date, with a top score of 56 achieved against the Netherlands during Ireland's victorious [[European Cricket Championship#2006|2006 European Cricket Championship]] campaign.

In August 2006, Botha was named in the 14 man squad which will represent Ireland at both the [[2007 ICC World Cricket League Division One|World Cricket League]] in Kenya and the Caribbean-hosted World Cup later the same year. He finished the provincial season with an insuperable batting average of 120.20 from ten innings.

Botha bowled well in the World Cricket League tournament, taking 13 wickets at an average of 21.30. Only one player took more wickets in the tournament.

In Ireland's second match in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]], Botha achieved excellent [[bowling analysis|bowling figures]] of 8–4–5–2, helping Ireland to a shock victory over [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wc2007/engine/current/match/247465.html Ireland v Pakistan, ICC World Cup – 9th match, Group D], Cricinfo, Retrieved on 29 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010 [[Cricket Ireland]], the governing body for cricket in Ireland, awarded Botha a full-time contract. He was one of six players awarded such contracts with Cricket Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ireland/content/story/444276.html |title=Ireland back players ahead of 2011 World Cup |publisher=Cricinfo |date=15 January 2010 |accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came just a year after the first professional contracts were awarded to Ireland's cricketers. Before that players were amateurs relying on income from other jobs and playing cricket in their spare time. The contract allowed Botha and the others to focus on cricket, with the aim of improving ahead of the [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketeurope4.net/DATABASE/ARTICLES2/articles/000072/007219.shtml |title=Cricket Ireland announce player contract details |publisher=CricketEurope |date=13 January 2010 |accessdate=2011-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723064326/http://www.cricketeurope4.net/DATABASE/ARTICLES2/articles/000072/007219.shtml |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botha was selected in Ireland's 15-man squad for the [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc_cricket_worldcup2011/content/story/497464.html |title=Ireland pick Ed Joyce for World Cup |publisher=Cricinfo |date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2011-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, Botha announced his retirement from international cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/cricket/2011/0504/ireland_bothaa.html|title=Andre Botha retires from international cricket|date=4 May 2011|work=RTÉ Sport|accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
Botha is only the fourth Irish player to have achieved the double of 2000 runs and 100 wickets. Botha has also taken part in two of Ireland’s record partnerships; 360 for the third wicket against UAE with [[Eoin Morgan]] in February 2007, and 234 for the sixth wicket against Scotland with [[Alex Cusack]] in August 2007. The 360 with Morgan is also Ireland’s highest partnership for any wicket. Botha’s 186 against Scotland in August 2007 was the highest individual score for Ireland in a home match.&lt;ref name="Record"/&gt;

Botha's extraordinary figures of 2/5 of eight overs in the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup pool match against Pakistan deserve mention; while taking only two wickets, the figures equalled the record for the most economical eight over spell in the history of the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/best_economy_rate_innings.html?id=12;type=trophy World Cup – Best economy rates in an innings], Cricinfo, Retrieved on 29 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The son of [[Georgios Papandreou]], Andreas was a [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-trained academic. He served three terms as [[prime minister of Greece]] (21 October 1981 to 2 June 1985; 2 June 1985 to 2 July 1989; and 13 October 1993 to 22 January 1996).

His assumption of power in 1981 influenced the course of Greek political history, ending an almost 50-year-long system of power dominated by conservative forces. The achievements of his successive governments include the official recognition of [[communist]] resistance groups of the [[Greek Resistance]] against the [[Axis powers|Axis]] occupation, the establishment of the National Health System and the [[Supreme Council for Personnel Selection]] (ASEP), the passage of Law 1264/1982 which secured the right to strike and greatly improved the rights of workers, the constitutional amendment of 1985–1986 which strengthened [[parliamentarism]] and reduced the powers of the indirectly-elected [[president of Greece|president]], the conduct of an assertive and independent Greek [[foreign policy]], the expansion in the power of [[local governments]], many progressive reforms in [[Law of Greece|Greek law]] and the granting of permission to the refugees of the [[Greek Civil War]], of Greek ethnicity, to return home in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Francis (1989) ''Western European political parties: a comprehensive guide''.

The [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK), which he founded and led, was the first non-communist political party in Greek history with a mass-based organization, introducing an unprecedented level of political and social participation in Greek society.&lt;ref name="Richard Clogg 1987. pp 122"/&gt; In a poll conducted by [[Kathimerini]] in 2007, 48% of those polled called Papandreou the "most important Greek Prime Minister".&lt;ref name="Kathimerini Metapolitefsi"&gt;{{cite news |last=Μαυρής|first=Γιάννης|title=Τομή στη Μεταπολίτευση το 1981|url=http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_2_30/12/2007_253770|accessdate=25 September 2011|newspaper=Kathimerini|date=30 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same poll, the first four years of Papandreou's government after [[Metapolitefsi]] were voted as the best government Greece ever had.&lt;ref name="Kathimerini Metapolitefsi2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Μεγάλες αλλαγές αλλά και μεγαλύτερες κοινωνικές ανισότητες|url=http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_1_30/12/2007_254003|accessdate=25 September 2011|newspaper=Kathimerini|date=30 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325094443/http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_1_30/12/2007_254003|archive-date=25 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Papandreou was born on the island of [[Chios]], Greece, the son of Zofia (Sofia) Mineyko (1883–1981) and the leading Greek liberal politician [[Georgios Papandreou|George Papandreou]]. His maternal grandfather was [[Poles|Polish]]-born public figure [[Zygmunt Mineyko]], and his maternal grandmother was Greek. Before university, he attended [[Athens College]] a leading private school in Greece. He attended the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]] from 1937 until 1938 when, during the authoritarian, right-leaning [[Ioannis Metaxas|Metaxas]] dictatorship, he was arrested for purported [[Trotskyism]].

In 1943, Papandreou received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in [[economics]] from [[Harvard University]].

[[File:Andreas Papandreou 1968.jpg|thumb|left|Andreas Papandreou in 1968]]
Papandreou returned to Greece in 1959, where he headed an economic development research program, by invitation of Prime Minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]. In 1960, he was appointed chairman of the board of directors, general director of the Athens Economic Research Center, and advisor to the [[Bank of Greece]]. In 1963, his father George Papandreou, head of the [[Center Union]], became prime minister of Greece. Andreas became his chief economic advisor. He renounced his American citizenship and was elected to the [[Greek Parliament]] in the [[Greek legislative election, 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BKEeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GKcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1446,6698518|title=Greece's leftist leader has strong U.S. ties|work=Anchorage Daily News|date=19 October 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; He immediately became Minister to the First Ministry of State (in effect, assistant Prime Minister).

Papandreou took publicly a neutral stand on the [[Cold War]] and wished for Greece to be more independent from the United States. He also criticized the massive presence of American military and intelligence in Greece, and sought to remove senior officers with anti-democratic tendencies from the Greek military.

In 1965, while the "[[Apostasia of 1965|Aspida]]" conspiracy within the [[Hellenic Army]], alleged by the political opposition to involve Andreas personally, was being investigated, George Papandreou moved to fire the defense minister and assume the post himself. [[Constantine II of Greece]] refused to endorse this move and essentially forced George Papandreou's resignation. Greece entered a period of political polarisation and instability which ended with the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|coup d'état of 21 April 1967]].

When the Greek colonels led by [[Georgios Papadopoulos]] seized power in April 1967, Andreas was incarcerated. [[Gust Avrakotos]], a high- ranking CIA officer in Greece who was close to the colonels who led the coup, advised them to "shoot the motherfucker because he's going to come back to haunt you".&lt;ref&gt;Crile, George (2003) ''Charlie Wilson's War'', Grove Press, {{ISBN|0802141242}}. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; His father George Papandreou was put under house arrest. George, already at advanced age, died in 1968. Under heavy pressure from American academics and intellectuals, such as [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], a friend of Andreas since their Harvard days, the military regime released Andreas on condition that he leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;Papandreou, Andreas (1970) ''Democracy at Gunpoint'', Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; Papandreou then moved to [[Sweden]] with his wife, four children, and mother. There he accepted a post at [[Stockholm University]]. In Paris, while in exile, Andreas Papandreou formed an anti-dictatorship organization, the [[Panhellenic Liberation Movement]] (PAK), and toured the world rallying opposition to the Greek military regime. Despite his former American citizenship and academic career in the United States, Papandreou held the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] responsible for the 1967 coup and became increasingly critical of the [[federal government of the United States]].

In the early 1970s, during the latter phase of the dictatorship in Greece, Papandreou, along with most leading Greek politicians in exile or in Greece, opposed the process of [[Spyros Markezinis#Premiership under the dictatorship|political normalisation]] attempted by [[Georgios Papadopoulos]] and his appointed PM, [[Spyros Markezinis]]. On 6 August 1974, Andreas Papandreou called an extraordinary meeting of the National Congress of PAK in [[Winterthur]], Switzerland, which decided its dissolution without announcing it publicly.&lt;ref name="PAK dissolution"&gt;[https://archive.is/20071222173601/http://tovima.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=B&amp;f=12633&amp;m=A29&amp;aa=1 To Vima newspaper, 11 July 1999]{{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papandreou returned to Greece after the fall of the junta in 1974, during [[metapolitefsi]], and formed a new "radical" party, the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] PASOK. Most of his former PAK companions, as well as members of other leftist groups such as the [[Democratic Defense]] joined in the new party. He also testified in the first of the [[Greek Junta Trials]] about the alleged involvement of the junta with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).

In the [[Greek legislative election, 1974]], PASOK received only 13.5% of the vote, but in [[Greek legislative election, 1977|1977]] it polled 25%, and Papandreou became leader of the opposition.

===The "Change"===
[[File:Andreas Papandreou (3585503528).jpg|thumb|Papandreou in 1981]]

At the [[Greek legislative election, 1981]], PASOK won a landslide victory over the conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party, and Papandreou became Greece's first socialist prime minister. The party's main slogan was ''Allagi'' (change).

{{quote|Greece to the Greeks!}}

In office, Papandreou backtracked from much of his campaign rhetoric and followed a more conventional approach. Greece did not withdraw from [[NATO]], United States troops and military bases were not ordered out of Greece, and Greek membership in the [[European Economic Community]] continued, largely because Papandreou proved very capable of securing monetary aid for Greece. In domestic affairs, Papandreou's government immediately carried out a massive programme of wealth redistribution upon coming into office that immediately increased the availability of entitlement aid to the unemployed and lower wage earners. Pensions, together with average wages and the minimum wage, were increased in real terms, and changes were made to labour laws which up until 1984 made it difficult for employers to make workers redundant. The impact of the PASOK Government's social and economic policies was such that it was estimated in 1988 that two-thirds of the decrease in inequality that occurred in Greece between 1974 and 1982 took place between 1981 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Eardley, Tony ''et al.''

During its time in office, Papandreou's government carried through sweeping reforms of social policy by introducing a welfare state,&lt;ref&gt;Kefala, Eleni (2007) ''Peripheral (post) modernity: the syncretist aesthetics of Borges, Piglia, Kalokyris and Kyriakidis''.

Rural areas benefited from improved state services, the rights and income of low paid workers were considerably improved, and refugees from the Civil War living in exile were allowed to return with impunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anagnosis.gr/index.php?pageID=474&amp;la=eng |title=Athens in the European Union I.

A more progressive taxation scheme was introduced and budgetary support for artistic and cultural programmes was increased.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Boggs, Carl (2005) ''The socialist tradition: from crisis to decline''. Psychology Press. {{ISBN|0415906709}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also introduced a wage indexation system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qumwwKbI0TQC&amp;pg=PA175|title=Modern Greece: A History since 1821 |author1=Koliopoulos, John S.  |author2=Veremis, Thanos M. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2009 |page=175 |isbn=9781444314830}}&lt;/ref&gt; which helped to close the gap modestly between the highest and lowest paid workers, while the share of GNP devoted to social welfare, social insurance, and health was significantly increased.&lt;ref&gt;Kofas, Jon V. (2005) ''Independence from America: global integration and inequality''. Ashgate. {{ISBN|0754645088}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other major policy changes included the establishment of parental leave for both parents and child care centres, maternity allowances, community health centres, and the encouragement of women to join agricultural cooperatives as full members, an option which previously had not been open to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gahpgrhou58C&amp;pg=PA117|title=From Another Place: Migration and the Politics of Culture |author =Bottomley, Gillian |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1992 |page=117 |isbn=9780521410144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of Papandreou's "Contract with the People," new liberalising laws were introduced which decriminalised adultery, abolished (in theory) the dowry system, eased the process for obtaining a divorce, and enhanced the legal status of women.&lt;ref name="workmall.com"/&gt;
In 1984, for instance, women were guaranteed equal pay for equal work.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Papandreou also introduced various reforms in the administration and curriculum of the Greek educational system, allowing students to participate in the election process for their professors and deans in the university, and abolishing tenure. The university system was expanded, with the number of students doubling between 1981 and 1986, while the system was reorganised to provide the departments with more power and permit greater participation in their management. The effect of these reforms was however, limited by poor research facilities, a shortage of qualified teaching staff, a lack of resources, and often inefficient administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qd7enfJ_PMUC&amp;pg=PA183|title=Regimes, Politics, and Markets: Democratization and Economic Change in Southern and Eastern Europe |author =Maravall, José María  |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |page=183 |isbn=9780198280835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a move strongly opposed by the [[Church of Greece]], Papandreou introduced, for the first time in Greece, the process of [[civil marriage]]. Prior to the institution of civil marriages in Greece, the only legally recognized marriages were those conducted in the Church of Greece. Couples seeking a civil marriage had to get married outside Greece, generally in [[Italy]]. Under PASOK, the Greek State also appropriated real estate properties previously owned by the Church.

A major part of Papandreou's ''allagi'' ("change") involved driving out the "old families" (''tzakia''. literally "hearths" using the traditional Greek expression for the genealogy of families), which dominated Greek politics and economy and belonged to the traditional Greek Right.

Papandreou was comfortably re-elected in the [[Greek legislative election, 1985]] with 46% of the vote, and won still further popularity in March 1987 by his strong leadership during a Greek-Turkish crisis in the [[Aegean Sea]]. However, from the summer of 1988, his premiership became increasingly clouded by controversy, as the Bank of Crete scandal exploded. In 1989, he divorced his wife [[Margaret Chant|Margaret Papandreou]] and married [[Dimitra Liani]] ([[Florina]], 30 April 1955), without issue.

==="Koskotas scandal", trial and return to power===
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--first three paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
The same year he was indicted by the [[Hellenic Parliament]] in connection with a US$200&amp;nbsp;million [[Bank of Crete (1980–1999)|Bank of Crete]] embezzlement scandal, and was accused of facilitating the embezzlement by ordering state corporations to transfer their holdings to the [[Bank of Crete (1980–1999)|Bank of Crete]], where the interest was allegedly skimmed off to benefit PASOK, and possibly some of its highest functionaries.

Following the many repercussions of the so-called [[Bank of Crete (1980–1999)|Koskotas scandal]], the [[Greek legislative election, June 1989]] elections produced a deadlock, leading to a prolonged political crisis. In the subsequent [[Greek legislative election, November 1989]] Papandreou's PASOK's won 40% of the popular vote, compared to the rival New Democracy's 46%, and, due to changes made in electoral law one year before the elections by the then reigning PASOK administration, New Democracy was not able to form a government. The [[Greek legislative election, 1990]] followed.

In the wake of three consecutive elections between 1989 and 1990, the New Democracy leader, [[Constantine Mitsotakis]], eventually received sufficient support to form a government. In January 1992, Papandreou himself was&lt;!-- "narrowly" removed. He was cleared. To qualify the degree of "cleared" is unnecessary. The readers can make up their own mind.  --&gt; cleared of any wrongdoing in the Koskotas scandal after a 7–6 vote in the specially convened High Court trial, ordered by the Hellenic Parliament, with the support of both main parties, New Democracy and PASOK. Since 1989, according to [[OTE]] official Christos Mavrikis, Papandreou discussions were recorded by him for the [[National Intelligence Service (Greece)|EYP]], following orders of [[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.news247.gr/eidiseis/oi-korioi-se-politikoys-o-k-karamanlhs-kai-h-mpakogiannh.734602.amp.html Το βρώμικο 89 στα wikileaks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Papandreou confounded his critics by winning the [[Greek legislative election, 1993]], and returned to power; In 1994 his government decided to apply an economic [[embargo]] to the [[Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]]. In 1995, an [[Macedonia naming dispute|interim accord]] was signed between the two countries.

However, his fragile health kept him from exercising firm political leadership. He was hospitalized with advanced [[heart disease]] and [[renal failure]] on 21 November 1995 and finally retired from office on 16 January 1996. He died on 23 June 1996, with his funeral procession producing crowds, ranging from "hundreds of thousands"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=New York Times |date=27 June 1996 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/27/world/greece-gives-a-last-sad-farewell-to-papandreou.html |title=Greece gives a last sad farewell to Papandreou }}&lt;/ref&gt; to "millions"&lt;ref&gt;Avriani, 27 June 1996&lt;/ref&gt; to bid farewell to Andreas. In 1999, Papandreou was posthumously awarded the Swedish [[Order of the Polar Star]].

==Economic policies==
The expenditure programme of the Papandreou government during 1981–1990 has been described as excessive by its conservative critics.&lt;ref name="Akis Haralambopoulos"&gt;Haralambopoulos, Akis (1997) [http://www.hri.org/forum/econ/greece97.html Review of the Greek Economy]. Hellenic Resources Institute&lt;/ref&gt; The excessive expenditures were not accompanied by corresponding [[revenue]] increases and this led to increases in [[budget deficit]]s and the [[public debt]].&lt;ref name="Akis Haralambopoulos"/&gt; Many [[economic indicator]]s worsened during 1981–1990 and the economic policies of his government were condemned as a failure by his critics.&lt;ref name="Bohlen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bohlen|first=Celestine|title=Ailing Papandreou Resigns, Asking Quick Election of Successor|work=The New York Times|page=5|date=16 January 1996|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/16/world/ailing-papandreou-resigns-asking-quick-election-of-successor.html|quote="But his economic policy was widely regarded as a failure that continues to cripple Greece's growth"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/fichero_articulo?codigo=1067537&amp;orden=72263 The Bumpy Road to Convergence] By Karl Aisinger Austrian Institute of Economic Research&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eduvinet.de/eduvinet/gr004.htm#3.

On the other hand, according to his supporters they were very successful, drastically increasing the purchasing power of the vast majority of Greeks, with personal incomes growing by 26% in real terms during the course of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=looking/&gt; Papandreou's increased spending in his early years in power (1981–1985) was necessary in order to heal the deep wounds of the Greek society, a society that was still deeply divided by the brutal memories of the Civil War and the right-wing repression that followed;&lt;ref&gt;Παράλογες αυτές οι μεγάλες αυξήσεις; Ίσως! Η Ελλάδα όμως άλλαξε μέσα σε τέσσερα χρόνια, η φτώχεια εξαλείφθηκε και ολόκληρες περιθωριοποιημένες ομάδες του πληθυσμού ενσωματώθηκαν σε μια κοινωνία αποκτώντας ελπίδα και όραμα.[http://www.tovima.gr/politics/article/?aid=112956 tovima.gr]&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, the postwar government philosophy of the Greek conservatives simply saw the state as a tool of repression, with very little money spent on health and education.&lt;ref&gt;Μεγάλη η αύξηση, αλλά συνεχίστηκε όλα τα επόμενα χρόνια και περισσότερο μάλιστα την τριετία 1990–1993 της ΝΔ, διότι δεν πρέπει ποτέ να ξεχνάμε ότι το μικρό και νοικοκυρεμένο κράτος των δεκαετιών του '50 και του '60 ήταν ένα κράτος που ήταν μόνο χωροφύλακας, χωρίς δαπάνες στην παιδεία, στην υγεία και γενικά χωρίς ενδιαφέρον για την κοινωνία. [http://www.tovima.gr/politics/article/?aid=112956]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International politics==
Papandreou was praised for conducting an independent and [[multidimensional]] foreign policy, and proved to be a master of the diplomatic game, thus increasing the importance of Greece in the international system.&lt;ref&gt;Duke, Simon (1989) ''United States military forces and installations in Europe''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0198291329}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was co-creator in 1982 of, and subsequently an active participant in, a movement promoted by the [[Parliamentarians for Global Action]], the [[Initiative of the Six]], which included, besides the Greek PM, [[Mexico]]'s president [[Miguel de la Madrid]], Argentina's president [[Raúl Alfonsín]], Sweden's prime minister [[Olof Palme]], Tanzania's president [[Julius Nyerere]] and [[India]]'s prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyper.gr/makthes/960624/60624j00.html Macedonia newspaper, 24 June 1996]{{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement's stated objective was the "promotion of peace and progress for all mankind". After various initiatives, mostly directed at pressuring the United States and the Soviet Union to stop [[nuclear testing]] and reduce the level of nuclear arms, it eventually disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roche |first=Douglas |url=http://archive.peacemagazine.org/v14n4p08.htm |title=The Middle Powers Initiative|work=Peace Magazine|year= 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papandreou's rhetoric was at times antagonistic to the United States.&lt;ref name="foreign affairs"/&gt; He was the first western prime minister to visit General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] in Poland.&lt;ref name="foreign affairs"/&gt; According to the Foreign Affairs magazine Papandreou went on record as saying that since the [[USSR]] is not a capitalist country "one cannot label it an imperialist power."&lt;ref name="foreign affairs"/&gt; According to Papandreou, "the Soviet Union represent[ed] a factor that restrict[ed] the expansion of capitalism and its imperialistic aims".&lt;ref name="foreign affairs"&gt;{{cite web|author=Loulis, John C. |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19841201faessay8413/john-c-loulis/papandreou-s-foreign-policy.html |title=Foreign Affairs magazine, Winter 1984/85 |publisher=Foreignaffairs.org |date=1 December 1984 |accessdate=23 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029202002/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19841201faessay8413/john-c-loulis/papandreou-s-foreign-policy.html |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This antagonistic stance made him extremely popular, because the previous conservative governments were seen by the Greek people as slavishly loyal to US interests.&lt;ref name=Kariotis&gt;Kariotis, Theodore C. (1992) ''The Greek socialist experiment: Papandreou's Greece 1981–1989'', Pella Publ., {{ISBN|0918618487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papandreou's government was the first in post-war Greece that redirected the nation's defense policy to suit its own security needs, and not those of the [[United States]]. According to historian Marion Sarafis, from 1947 until 1981, the US had more influence in Greece's military policy than the indigenous Greek high command, largely due to the decisive role played by the US in the Greek Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Sarafis, Marion (1990) ''Background to contemporary Greece'', vol. 1, {{ISBN|0850363934}}, pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Papandreou supported the causes of various [[national liberation]] movements in the world, and agreed for Greece to host representatives offices of many such organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GREECE GRANTS DIPLOMATIC STATUS TO P.L.O.

==Papandreou's image and influence in Greek popular culture==
Among both his supporters and his opponents, Papandreou was referred to simply by his first name, "Andreas", a unique situation in Greek political history, and a testament to his [[charisma]] and popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Clogg, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Andreas was also famous for wearing his business suits with [[turtleneck]] sweaters (Ζιβάγκο in Greek),&lt;ref name=Kariotis/&gt; instead of the traditional white shirt and tie; he thus created a huge fashion, mainly but not exclusively among his political supporters. His first appearance in the Greek Parliament with a black turtleneck instead of shirt and tie caused a massive uproar in the conservative press, who considered him disrespectful of Parliament; however, the whole issue only added to his popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Chilcote, Ronald H.

==Legacy==
[[File:Grave of Andreas Papandreou.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Papandreou's grave in the [[First Cemetery of Athens]]. On his grave is written ''Hellas belongs to the Hellenes''.]]

Papandreou exercised a more independent foreign policy elevating Greece's profile among non-aligned nations. He affirmed Greece's independence in setting her own policy agenda, both internally and externally, free from any foreign domination.

His opponents on the left, on the other hand, including the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE), accused him of supporting, in practice, the agenda of NATO and the United States.

Andreas Papandreou is widely acknowledged as having shifted political power from the traditional conservative Greek Right, which had dominated Greek politics for decades, to a more populist and centre-left locus. This included the so-called [[pariah state|pariah]]s in politics as of the end of the [[Greek Civil War]], which were given a chance to prove themselves in democratically elected governments.&lt;ref name="Google Book"/&gt; This shift in the Greek political landscape helped heal some of the old civil war wounds;&lt;ref name="Google Book"/&gt; Greece became more pluralistic, and more in line with the political system of other western European countries.&lt;ref name="Google Book"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XE97ryf8noAC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=contradictions+Papadopoulos+dictatorship&amp;source=web&amp;ots=uMypQ1vfJJ&amp;sig=xuBkuKHjvMrKABa13mxIhq4WA7s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA13,M1 Recent Social Trends in France, 1960–1990] Michel Forsé Quote: "The coming into office of PASOK signified both socially and politically the end of the post civil war era. Certainly this is true already for the period after the collapse of dictatorship (1974) but it is systematized by PASOK. Essentially this means that the forms of political and as such social and economic exclusion that had distinguished the post civil war times vanish for good." p 13 {{ISBN|0-7735-0887-2}} &lt;br&gt; also Recent Social Trends in Greece, 1960–2000 By Dimitris Charalambis, Laura Maratou-Alipranti, Andromachi Hadjiyanni Translated by Dimitris Charalambis, Laura Maratou-Alipranti, Andromachi Hadjiyanni Contributor Dimitris Charalambis, Laura Maratou-Alipranti, Andromachi Hadjiyanni Published by McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP, 2004 {{ISBN|0-7735-2202-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7735-2202-2}}, 701 pages retrieved 15 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Papandreou also systematically pursued inclusionist politics which ended the sociopolitical and economic exclusion of many social classes in the post-civil war era.&lt;ref name="Google Book"/&gt;

It is also acknowledged that Papandreou, along with Karamanlis, played a leading role in establishing democracy in Greece during [[metapolitefsi]].&lt;ref name="HFEFP"/&gt; He is described as both prudent and a realist, despite his appearance as a leftist ideologue, and charismatic orator.&lt;ref name="HFEFP"&gt;[http://www.eliamep.gr/eliamep/content/home/media/opinions/2005/karamanlis_and_papandreou/el/ Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy] Οι ηγετικοί ρόλοι του Κωνσταντίνου Καραμανλή και του Ανδρέα Παπανδρέου στη διαδικασία εδραίωσης της δημοκρατίας μετά το 1974 Κουλουμπής Θεόδωρος  (Καθημερινή) 6 Νοεμβρίου 2005 Quote: "Το χρήσιμο συμπέρασμα, λοιπόν, σχετικά με τον Παπανδρέου είναι το εξής: ενώ ήταν ιδεολόγος και χαρισματικός ρήτορας αριστερού τύπου στην θεωρία, στην πράξη αποδείχθηκε συνετός και πραγματιστής. Και αυτό φαίνεται από τις επιλογές του να παραμείνει στην Ευρωπαϊκή Ένωση, που τόσο έντονα είχε αμφισβητήσει λίγα χρόνια νωρίτερα, και να παραμείνει στο ΝΑΤΟ που τόσο απόλυτα είχε καταδικάσει. Επίσης με πραγματιστικό τρόπο χειρίστηκε τις διαπραγματεύσεις για τις αμερικανικές βάσεις: δήθεν συμφωνήθηκε η «αποχώρηση» των βάσεων, αλλά οι βάσεις παρέμειναν. Με αυτόν τον τρόπο άνοιξε ο δρόμος της ταύτισης των μεγάλων πολιτικών δυνάμεων στον τόπο μας γύρω από ένα κοινό στρατηγικό στόχο" (In Greek)&lt;/ref&gt; His choices to remain in the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]], both of which he vehemently opposed for many years, proved his pragmatic approach.&lt;ref name="HFEFP"/&gt; Even his approach of negotiating the removal of the US bases from Greece was diplomatic, because although it was agreed to remove them, some of the bases remained.&lt;ref name="HFEFP"/&gt; His skillful handling of these difficult policies had the effect of providing common policy goals to the political forces of Greece.&lt;ref name="HFEFP"/&gt; Complementing this political realism, Andreas' ability to publicly say no to the Americans gave Greeks a sense of national independence and psychological self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, James Edward (2009) ''The United States and the making of modern Greece''. University of North Carolina Press. {{ISBN|0807887943}}. p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;
Perhaps his most important achievement was the establishment of political equality among Greeks; during his years in power the defeated left-wingers of the Civil War were no longer treated like [[second-class citizen]]s and a vital part of [[national memory]] was reclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;Carabott, Philip and Sfikas, Thanassis D. (2004) ''The Greek Civil War: essays on a conflict of exceptionalism and silences''. Ashgate. {{ISBN|0754641317}}. pp. 262–266&lt;/ref&gt;

Papandreou's successor in office, [[Costas Simitis]], broke with a number of Papandreou's approaches.

Papandreou's son, [[George Papandreou (junior)|George Papandreou]], was elected leader of PASOK in February 2004 and prime minister during the October 2009 general elections. A common slogan among PASOK followers in political rallies, invokes Andreas' legacy with the chant ''"Andrea, zis! Esi mas odigis!"'' ("Andreas, you are still alive! You're leading us!").

In two separate polls, conducted in 2007 and 2010, Andreas Papandreou was voted as the best prime minister of Greece since the restoration of democracy in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Kathimerini tis Kyriakis, 30 December 2007, "Τομή στην Μεταπολίτευση το 1981"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Real News, 3 January 2010, Βασίλης Θωμόπουλος, "Πρωτιά για Ανδρέα και Αλλαγή"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theodore Katsanevas ===
Until their divorce in 2000, Papandreou's daughter Sofia was married to the academic and politician [[Theodore Katsanevas]].&lt;ref name="PressProject"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepressproject.net/article/56330/How-a-Greek-politician-is-attempting-to-rewrite-history-by-suing-Wikipedia-the-online-encyclopedia-he-doesnt-understand |title=How a Greek politician is attempting to rewrite history by suing Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia he doesn't understand |publisher=thepressproject.net |author=Efimeros, Kostas |accessdate=15 February 2014 |date=13 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222040545/http://www.thepressproject.net/article/56330/How-a-Greek-politician-is-attempting-to-rewrite-history-by-suing-Wikipedia-the-online-encyclopedia-he-doesnt-understand |archive-date=22 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= BaltimoreSun&gt;{{cite web | title = Katsanevas Papandreou – Disinherited children contest Papandreou's will Greek premier had left entire estate to widow |work= Baltimore Sun | url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-09-29/news/1996273082_1_andreas-papandreou-katsanevas-liani | accessdate = 15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Papandreou's will, he accused Katsanevas of being a "disgrace to the family" ({{lang-el|όνειδος της οικογένειας}}) &lt;ref name= BaltimoreSun /&gt;&lt;ref name="ana1996091215"&gt;[http://www.hri.org/news/greek/ana/1996/96-09-13.ana.html#15 Reactions to Papandreou's will], Athens News Agency, 13 September 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Papandreous' legacy – SFGate | url = http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/NOTES-FROM-HERE-AND-THERE-2965745.php | accessdate = 15 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tovima_diamadia_skoupidia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tovima.gr/culture/article/?aid=84975|title=Διαμάντια &amp; σκουπίδια  – ολιτισμός|publisher=tovima.gr|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="protagon_katsanabas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protagon.gr/?i=protagon.el.8emata&amp;lid=3202 |title=Διαθήκη εκ του διατίθημι|publisher=protagon.gr|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tovima_katsanevas_diathiki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tovima.gr/relatedarticles/article/?aid=82208&amp;dt=15/09/1996 |title=Η διαθήκη σε... δίκη|publisher=tovima.gr|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="corriere_katsanevas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1996/settembre/21/Atene_fattore_Mimi_abbatte_sul_co_0_96092113453.shtml|title=Atene: il fattore Mimi' s' abbatte sul voto|publisher=archiviostorico.corriere.it|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Study and Education ===

In 1961 Anne Rasa graduated with [[Bachelor of Science]] (Hons.) from the [[Royal College of Science]], [[Imperial College]], [[London University]]. Subsequently, she received a [[NATO]]-scholarship to investigate the aggression of fish. In 1965 she graduated with [[Master of Science]] (M.Sc.) from the [[University of Hawaii]].

=== Scientific Work ===

In 1970 Anne Rasa received her [[Ph.D.]] from [[London University]] with a [[Max-Planck-Institut|Max-Planck]]-Scholarship on [[coral reef fish]] aggression under [[Konrad Lorenz]].

From 1970-1974 she continued her work at the [[Max-Planck-Institut]] für Verhaltenspsychologie in Seewiesen under Konrad Lorenz. During this period she started her Dwarf mongoose studies, concentrating on social structure, marking behavior and intra-group aggression.

From 1975-1981 Anne Rasa was scientific assistant at [[Marburg University]], [[Germany]]. She focused on [[ontogeny]] of behavior in Dwarf mongoose and was awarded the Dr. habil. ([[Habilitation]]: qualified as a professor) in 1981.

From 1981-1986 she was working with [[University of Bayreuth]], Germany, with a [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]-Scholarship to accomplished her field studies on Dwarf mongoose in the [[Taru Desert]], [[Kenya]]. Anne Rasa published the results of her studies in the book ''Mongoose Watch: A Family Observed'' with a foreword by Konrad Lorenz. He compares the significance of her works with those of [[Jane Goodall]] and [[Dian Fossey]].&lt;ref&gt;Anne E. Rasa: ''Die perfekte Familie.'' DVA 1985, p. 8-9. Engl.: Anne Rasa: Mongoose Watch - A Family Observed, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 the book with its results was presented by [[Bernhard Grzimek]] in the popular German TV-series ''Expedition ins Tierreich'' and was translated into several languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kalahari-trails.co.za/index.php?p=23&amp;lang=ger Kalahari Trails Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1986-1991 Anne Rasa was [[Associate Professor]] at [[Pretoria University]], [[South Africa]], teaching [[ethology]] (lectures and practicals) and starting her studies on [[Yellow mongoose]] in the [[Kalahari Desert]].

In 1991 she became Associate Professor at [[University of Bonn]], Germany, where she was teaching ethology (lectures and practicals), too, and continuing her studies on Yellow mongoose and studies on the sub-social tenebrionid beetle ''Parastizopus armaticeps''. Anne Rasa retired from Bonn University at the end of 2000.

=== Retirement to present ===

Anne Rasa owns the Nature Reserve ''Kalahari Trails'' at the southern end of the Kalahari Desert in South Africa, which she bought a few years prior to her retirement. She lives there since December 2000 and offers accommodation and guided walks to everyone who is interested in the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] of the Kalahari.

In 2007 OSHANA published the book ''KALAHARI – Magnificent Desert'' with pictures and text by Anne Rasa.

In 2011/2012 Anne Rasa was working as a scientific advisor on a film series called ''Kalahari Trails'' which is being shot in the Kalahari.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12346">'''Benjamin LaGuer''' (born May 1, 1963) is a convicted rapist serving a life sentence in [[Massachusetts]]. He has not acknowledged the crime for which he was convicted, claiming innocence. His case achieved prominence in the late 1980s when reporting by [[John King (journalist)|John King]] discovered a [[jury|juror]] who said that other members of the all-white-male jury uttered racist slurs before and during deliberations.&lt;ref&gt;John King (1987, September 16), ''"LaGuer's Struggle for Freedom"'', Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Taylor, (1994 May), ''"And the Truth Shall Set Him Free. Or Will It?"'', Esquire Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; His case became a flashpoint in the [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 race for Massachusetts Governor]] when it was revealed that [[Deval Patrick]], the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] candidate, had corresponded with and supported the inmate over a period of several years.

== Early life ==
LaGuer was born in [[The Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and grew up in New York and [[Puerto Rico]] until age 15 when he moved to [[Leominster, Massachusetts]] to live with a half sister who was his father's daughter from a previous marriage. He attended high school in Leominster before dropping out in late 1980 to join the Army where he served in a support capacity in [[Germany]]. With a discharge from the Army, he returned to Leominster in June 1983. On the morning of July 13, 1983 police were summoned to his neighbor's apartment where they discovered a 59-year-old woman bound and beaten. It was quickly determined to be a rape case. Two days later, on July 15, 1983, LaGuer was charged with the crime. He proclaimed his innocence but was convicted in Worcester Superior Court the following January and given a life sentence with eligibility for parole after 15 years.

== Challenges to the conviction ==
Soon after starting his prison term LaGuer began studying in the law library and learned how to access the legal system on his own behalf and for other inmates. In 1991, a challenge LaGuer launched to his conviction two years earlier went all the way to the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] which rendered a landmark ruling in LaGuer's favor. At issue was whether an affidavit given by [[jury|juror]] William Nowick that other members of the all-white-male panel made racist comments before and during deliberations constituted a violation of LaGuer's right to a fair trial. Even though the state's high court sided with LaGuer as a matter of law, it did not overturn the verdict, instead sending it back to the trial judge, Robert Mulkern, for a finding of fact. After a hearing in which some jurors were called to testify, Judge Mulkern ruled that the jury's deliberations were not tainted by racism. LaGuer exhausted his last appeal of that decision in 1994, more than ten years after his conviction.

The case became well known among activists, academics, and journalists, who came to believe strongly that LaGuer had suffered a gross miscarriage of justice. Starting in 1986, reporters who looked at the case found troubling questions about whether LaGuer in fact committed the crime. Among those who took an interest in the case and who corresponded with LaGuer were [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Elie Wiesel]], [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning author [[William Styron]], [[Harvard University]] professor [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]], [[Harvard Law School]] professor [[Charles Ogletree]], and [[WBUR]] radio personality Jose Masso, who created the [[Benjamin LaGuer papers]] collection at [[Northeastern University]].&lt;ref name="Benjamin LaGuer papers"&gt;[http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m100findprint.htm Benjamin LaGuer papers collection at Northeastern University, Boston]&lt;/ref&gt; During that time LaGuer also earned a bachelor's degree magna cum laude from [[Boston University]] and won a first place [[International PEN]] award for an essay on his mother. In 1998, LaGuer was for the first time eligible for parole but was denied because he refused to admit to the crime. At that point he attracted an unlikely ally in [[Boston University]] president and 1990 Democratic candidate for governor of [[Massachusetts]], [[John Silber]], who helped arrange for pro bono legal representation. His team, which included members of [[McDermott, Will &amp; Emery]], the law firm [[William Weld]], Silber's opponent in the governor's race, had belonged to, successfully sued the parole board and forced a second hearing at which LaGuer was again denied parole.

== Response to a DNA test that backfired ==
His legal team, led by law professor David Siegel, a founding member of the New England [[Innocence Project]], then sought and found the physical evidence from the crime and in 1999 [[McDermott, Will &amp; Emery]] managing partner Robert Cordy, now a member of the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], wrote to the Worcester District Attorney in an attempt to establish a protocol for [[DNA]] testing. The district attorney, [[John Conte (politician)|John Conte]], a former State Senator appointed by Governor [[Michael Dukakis]] in 1976 to finish an unexpired term, rebuffed Cordy, in turn intimating that LaGuer's team may have tampered with the evidence. After more than two years of contentious and costly litigation a DNA test revealed a trace amount of LaGuer's genetic material in the evidence. Several forensic DNA experts, including [[Applied DNA Resources]] principal Theodore Kessis,&lt;ref name="Kessis Letter"&gt;http://www.freebennow.org/kessisletter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Jay College]] of Criminal Justice Associate Provost [[Lawrence Kobilinsky]]&lt;ref name="Kobilinsky Letter"&gt;http://www.freebennow.org/kobilinsky_letter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Harvard University]] geneticist [[Daniel Hartl]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benlaguer.org/&lt;/ref&gt; questioned the DNA test, and called for an investigation into its validity.

LaGuer continued to maintain his innocence and attracted the pro bono services of another high powered international law firm, [[Goodwin Procter]], where [[James C. Rehnquist]], a partner at the firm and son of then U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], took over LaGuer's case. In February 2004, Rehnquist filed a motion for a new trial in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] Superior Court seeking a new trial on the basis of a [[Massachusetts State Police]] report generated the day LaGuer was arrested showing that four fingerprints found on the base of the trimline telephone, the cord of which was used to bind the victim's wrists, did not match the defendant's. This revelation prompted concern from several lawmakers, including State Senator [[Jarrett Barrios]], who made a written inquiry to the State Police crime lab. Rehnquist's position that the suppression of potentially exculpatory evidence (revealed in November 2001, almost 18 years after the trial) constituted a violation of LaGuer's right to a fair trial, was rejected by Worcester Superior Court Judge Timothy Hillman. Rehnquist appealed the decision where he was again denied. In June 2006, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] agreed to hear the case. On March 23, 2007, the Supreme Judicial Court unanimously upheld LaGuer's conviction.

== Political use of the LaGuer case in the Massachusetts Governor's race ==
In [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2006|2006]], the LaGuer case became a dominant issue in the race between Republican Lieutenant Governor [[Kerry Healey]] and Democrat [[Deval Patrick]] [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2006]] when it was revealed that Patrick had petitioned the parole board in 1998 and 2000 for LaGuer's freedom and had contributed financially to the DNA testing. In his letters to the parole board Patrick characterized LaGuer as "thoughtful and eloquent." He was criticized in two widely used television ads, considered by some analysts to be among the most negative in the 2006 campaign season.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Vennochi, (2006, October 15), ''"Voters mustn't get stuck in the mud"'', Boston Globe.&lt;/ref&gt; In one ad featuring a woman walking alone in a parking garage, the narrator asks, "have you ever heard a woman compliment a rapist?" The ad was widely perceived as backfiring on Healey because of its negative tone. Patrick ultimately won the race by a margin of more than 20 percentage points.

== Developments since 2006 ==
The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court heard LaGuer's appeal&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;[http://www.suffolk.edu/sjc/archive/2007/SJC_09765.html Benjamin LaGuer's appeal to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]&lt;/ref&gt; on January 4, 2007 and a ruling was rendered on March 23, 2007.  The SJC unanimously upheld LaGuer's conviction.&lt;ref name="SJC upholds conviction"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2007/03/sjc_upholds_lag.html News story reporting the upheld conviction by The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', 23 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the decision a former caretaker to the victim stepped forward with new information about the victim's state of mind before and after the crime which raised previously unknown questions about the reliability of her identification.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Goldscheider, (2007, April 5), "Tragedy Times Two", Valley Advocate.{{cite web|url=http://benlaguer.com/articles/040507_tragedy_times_two.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007210345/http://benlaguer.com/articles/040507_tragedy_times_two.html |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, retired Superior Court Judge Isaac Borentstein took the case.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Saltzman, (2009, March 20) "Ex Judge Takes Up Convict's Cause", Boston Globe.[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/03/20/ex_judge_takes_up_convicts_cause/]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2778">[[File:Serment du jeu de paume cadrage clerge.jpg|thumb|right|Dom Gerle, painted as present at the Tennis Court Oath, by David.]]
'''Christophe Antoine Gerle''' (1736-c. 1801), [[France|French revolution]]ist and [[mysticism|mystic]], was born at [[Riom]] in [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]].

Entering the [[Carthusian]] order early in life, he became prior of Laval-Dieu in [[Perche]], and afterwards of Pont-Sainte-Marie at [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]]. Elected deputy to the states-general in 1789, Gerle became very popular, and though he had no seat in the assembly until after the [[Tennis Court Oath]], being only deputy suppleant, he is represented in [[Jacques-Louis David|David]]'s classic painting as taking part in it. In 1792 he was chosen elector of Paris.

In the revolutionary turmoil Gerle developed a strong vein of mysticism, mingled with ideas of reform, and in June 1790 the prophetic powers of [[Suzanne Labrousse]] (1747-1821), a visionary who had predicted the Revolution ten years before, were brought by him to the notice of the [[National Convention|Convention]]. In Paris, where he lived first with a spiritualistic doctor and afterwards, like [[Robespierre]], at the house of a cabinet-maker, his mystical tendencies were strengthened.

The ideas of [[Catherine Théot]]&amp;mdash;a convent servant turned prophetess&amp;mdash;who proclaimed herself the Virgin, the "Mother of God" and the "new Eve," were eminently attractive to Gerle; in the person of [[Robespierre]] he recognized the Messiah, and at the meetings of the Théotists he officiated with the aged prophetess as co-president. But the activities of Catherine and her adepts were short-lived.

The Théotists' cult of Robespierre was a weapon in the hands of his opponents; and shortly after the festival of the Supreme Being, [[Marc-Guillaume-Alexis Vadier|Vadier]] made a report to the Convention calling for the prosecution of Catherine, Gerle and others as fanatics and conspirators. They were arrested, thrown into prison and, in the confusion of Robespierre's fall, apparently forgotten.

Catherine died in prison, but Gerle, released by [[French Directory|the Directory]], became one of the editors of the ''Messager du soir'', and was afterwards in the office of [[Pierre Bénézech]] (1775-1802), minister of the interior. Having renounced his monastic vows in Paris, he is thought to have married, towards the close of his life, Christine Raffet, aunt of the artist [[Denis Raffet]]. The date of his death is uncertain.

Joining the travel department he spent his first month in the bookshop dusting the shelves in order to become acquainted with the stock.&lt;ref name=dealer&gt;[http://www.sheila-markham.com/Archives/cfarah.htm Farahar interviewed in ''The Bookdealer'' in June 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1972 Farahar joined the staff of a bookshop in [[Culham]], between [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]] and [[Oxford]], before becoming a market trader at [[Bath Antiques Market]] where he sold books during the week and worked as a wine waiter at weekends in order to make ends meet. In the summer of 1976 he met his wife, Sophie Dupré, the manuscript specialist, and in 1979 he became a partner in Francis Edwards in London where he took responsibility for a new book investment scheme. However, the venture failed and the [[Receivership|receivers]] were called in. The new owner of Francis Edwards invited Farahar back as manager but when the business moved to [[Hay-on-Wye]] in order to reduce costs Farahar decided to leave and set up his own antiquarian travel book business.  He and his family had moved to their home in [[Calne]] in [[Wiltshire]] in 1980 where Sophie had already set up her autograph and manuscript business.&lt;ref name=dealer/&gt;

Their daughter, Emily Farahar, a keen artist and photographer who had been hoping to start a degree in [[Fine Art]], died in 2001 aged 21 from an overdose of [[heroin]] following years of mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.thisiswiltshire.co.uk/2002/5/30/187133.html 'Did health service fail heroin victim?'

In 2003, when the ''Antiques Roadshow'' visited [[Dumfries]] in [[Scotland]], Farahar identified a collection of 23 drawings and watercolours as the work of [[Beatrix Potter]].

'''Darryl W. Perry''' (born February 7, 1978) is an American activist, author, radio host and politician. 

== Early life ==
Daryl W. Perry was born and raised in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], and the surrounding area, graduating from [[Hewitt-Trussville High School]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darrylwperry.com/bio/|title=Bio|date=17 April 2017|website=darrylwperry.com|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darryl attended [[Jefferson State Community College]] on a scholarship with the Speech Team (Forensics Team), and later on a Management Scholarship with WJSR-FM, the college radio station. Darryl was station manager from the summer of 1997 until he graduated in 1998.

==Career==
He hosts the daily newscast FPPradioNews, the podcast Peace, Love, Liberty Radio, the weekly news podcast FPP Freedom Minute, and is a regular co-host on Free Talk Live. 

Perry is a co-founder of the New Hampshire Liberty Party, and was on the National Committee of the [[Boston Tea Party]] from 2008-2012, twice serving as chair. Perry later sought the [[Libertarian Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Libertarian Party presidential nomination]] on a platform as the only "real" Libertarian running. To fund his candidacy, Perry accepted donations only in valuables not sanctioned by a government, such as encrypted electronic currencies or non-coin metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/gary-johnson-wins-libertarian-nomination-only-major-candidate-to-accept-bitcoin-donations |title=Gary Johnson Wins Libertarian Nomination, Only Major Candidate to Accept Bitcoin Donations |last=Valenzuela |first=Joël |date=May 30, 2016 |website=The Cointelegraph |publisher= |access-date=January 5, 2017 |quote=Darryl W. Perry, former Libertarian presidential campaign, famously accepted donations exclusively in cryptocurrency, precious metals, and other non-governmental stores of value.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the [[2016 Libertarian National Convention|Libertarian Convention]] and the nomination of [[Gary Johnson]], he voiced concerns over Johnson's vice presidential nominee [[Bill Weld]], citing the failure of the [[Reform Party of the United States|Reform Party]] as evidence that The Libertarian Party needed a more consistent message and suggesting Will Coley or [[Larry Sharpe (politician)|Larry Sharpe]] as more suitable running mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4601274/darryl-w-perrys-concession-speech|title=Darryl W. Perry's concession speech|website=C-SPAN.org|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He confronted Weld before the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbMw1ds8JAA|title=Darryl Perry confronts William Weld|first=|last=Jeff Wood|date=1 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=6 January 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the convention he announced a limited write-in campaign in 17 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://independentpoliticalreport.com/2016/09/darryl-w-perry-announces-limited-presidential-write-in-campaign/|title=Darryl W.

==Political positions==
Perry is considered a "hard-core" libertarian, who expressed dismay that [[Gary Johnson]] won the Libertarian's 2016 Presidential nomination.&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/libertarian-party-gary-johnson-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-spoiler-1.3612883 |title=Libertarian Gary Johnson could swing votes from Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton |last=Kwong |first=Matt |date=June 5, 2016 |website=CBCNEWS |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He supports the decriminalization of recreational drugs, stating they "should be as legal as tomatoes."&lt;ref name=cbc /&gt; He supports a [[non-interventionist]] foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://fpp.cc/non-intervention-its-good-enough-for-you-why-not-the-nation/&lt;/ref&gt; Perry has an [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] platform, calling the United States Government "the world's biggest terrorist organization" and advocates abolishing the United States Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1ugtes7ZYA|title=Libertarian presidential candidates face off in RT-hosted debate|first=|last=RT America|date=12 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=6 January 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drauzin Angelle''' (December 25, 1871 – December 19, 1958) was an [[Americans|American]] [[farmer]] and a [[politician]] from [[St. Martin Parish, Louisiana|St. Martin Parish]] in south [[U.S. state]] of [[Louisiana]]. As the chief [[deputy sheriff]] from 1924 until his death, Angelle became a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] power broker in his largely rural [[sugar]]-producing parish.&lt;ref name=angelle&gt;"Drauzin Angelle", ''A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography'', Vol. 1 (1988), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in the Fifth Ward of St. Martin Parish to Jean-Baptiste Angelle and the former Arthemise Dupuis (pronounced DEW PWEE), he was twice married. With the former Aminth Guidry, he had a daughter, Mozella. He then wed the former Agnes Guidry Dupuis on March 27, 1894, and they had eight children.&lt;ref name=angelle/&gt;

Their only son was [[Bob Angelle|Robert Joseph "Bob" Angelle]], who would serve in the 1920s as mayor of [[Breaux Bridge, Louisiana|Breaux Bridge]] in St. Martin Parish and thereafter in the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] from 1934-1964. Bob Angelle was also the [[Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives]] from 1957-1960. One of their seven daughters, Agnes A. Hardy, a schoolteacher and principal from Cecilia, was the mother of future [[Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana]] [[Paul Hardy]], the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to hold the second-ranking post in state government, having served from 1988 to 1992.&lt;ref name=agneshardy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avoyellestoday.com/pages/full_story/push?article-Agnes+Angelle+Hardy%20&amp;id=8635494|title=Agnes Angelle Hardy|publisher=avoyellestoday.com|accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Governor Paul Hardy was hence a grandson of Drauzin Angelle and a nephew of Speaker Bob Angelle.  Hardy's brother, Florent Hardy, Jr., Ph.D., has served as Louisiana's State Archivist since 2000.

Drauzin Angelle's only elected position was as a [[constable]] of the Fifth Ward, a position that he held from 1914 to 1924, when he became the chief deputy under Sheriff [[Wade O. Martin, Sr.]], and continued in that capacity after Martin was elected in 1932 to the [[Louisiana Public Service Commission]]. Angelle hence remained chief deputy under a number of sheriffs. The sheriffs ran for reelection every four years along with the [[governor of Louisiana|governor]]'s race, but Angelle as the power behind the sheriff remained chief deputy throughout three decades. Angelle was known as the organizer of "The Old Faction" and the "Father of the Fifth Ward".&lt;ref name=angelle/&gt;

Angelle was tied to the [[Huey Long|Long]] [[Political faction|faction]] of Louisiana politics, as was Sheriff Martin.&lt;ref name=angelle/&gt; However, in the late 1950s, following the death of Wade O. Martin, Sr., [[Wade O. Martin, Jr.]], the [[Louisiana Secretary of State]], quarreled with Governor [[Earl Kemp Long]], who obtained legislative passage of bills to strip Martin, Jr., of much of the jurisdiction of his office. Drauzin Angelle died during the time of this Long-Martin rivalry. Later, Wade O. Martin, Jr., like Paul Hardy, switched his partisan affiliation from Democrat to Republican.

Angelle is interred at St. Joseph [[Catholic]] Cemetery in [[Cecilia, Louisiana|Cecilia]], a town in northern St. Martin Parish.&lt;ref name=angelle/&gt;

'''Dvar''' is an anonymous [[virtual band]] from [[Music of Russia|Russia]] that plays [[Dark wave|darkwave]] and [[electronic music]]. The first Dvar album was released in 1995, and the last in 2012.

==History==
The members of Dvar have kept their identities secret, therefore very little is known about their formation. In an interview, they stated, "Dvar is something that came in a dream."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Band members claim to have heard music in their dreams, presented to them by a being named Dvar.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} In several interviews the band has insisted that all of their music is directly inspired by the Dvar being, with the band serving as mere messengers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Some fans have claimed that the Dvar being took on the shape of a giant bee, based on the recurring theme of bees in their album artwork.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} They stated in an interview, when asked what they think about [[Kabbalah]] learnings, that they know Dvar is 211.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dark.gothic.ru/dvar/englishinterview.htm Dvar&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In Hebrew, ''Dvar'' means ''Word of...'' or ''thing''.

The vocals which accompany Dvar's music use what appears to be a [[constructed language]], which displays a sound pattern that is somewhat reminiscent of ancient [[Semitic languages]].  Due to this similarity, many followers of the band claim that the "lyrics" are sung in the [[occult]] [[Enochian|Enochian language]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} However, the band has given no clues as to the nature of their invented language, except to say that, like the music, the vocals merely relate the message of the Dvar being.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Their first known work was a 1998 self-released tape called ''Raii'', though rumors have circulated of an earlier self-released tape from 1995, simply named ''DVAR''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dvar.lameroid.ru/2015/02/dvar-disco.html DVAR discography]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, the duo issued a self-released 4-track CD-R demo called ''Taai Liira''. In 2002, the band released their first album on the Italian S.P.K.R/Radio Luxor record label, called ''Piirrah''. In 2003, Dvar moved to the Russian label Irond and released five albums: ''Roach'' (2003), ''Rakhilim'' (2004), a 2004 re-release of ''Taai Liira'' with bonus tracks, ''Hor Hor'' (2005) and ''Oramah Maalhur'' (2005). The album ''Madegirah – Early Works'' was announced in 2005, but not be released until 2009. In 2007, the band moved to the label Gravitator and released ''Jraah Mraah''. Their song "Teremiah K'ruun" was used in an [[Alfa-Bank]] 2007 New Year commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alfabank.ru/about/ads/newyear-2007/flash/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717204719/http://alfabank.ru/about/ads/newyear-2007/flash/ |archivedate=2007-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://putoblog.wordpress.com/2008/06/14/dvar/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the band released ''Zii'' under the label Art Music Group. In 2009, ''Fayah!'' was released, a dark counterpart to ''Zii'', along with a release of Madegirah, now entitled ''Madegirah – Bizarre Rares and Early Works''. In mid-2010, their tenth anniversary album, ''El Mariil'' was released, with an unusual medieval sound. A new album ''Deii'' was released in Russian magazine "[[Mir Fantastiki|Мир Фантастики]]" (English: ''Mir Fantastiki'' {{a.k.a.}} ''World of Sci-Fi'')  in mp3 320 kb/s format. Physical copies of the album were released in December 2012 on Shadowplay Records. The release consists of two parts (two 16-track CDs) in Digipack format.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Style==
The band has an idiosyncratic style combining [[electronic music]] with screeching and bird-like vocals. The lyrics, according to the band, are written in the [[Enochian]] language, though they claim that they do not understand most of what is told to them by the creature Dvar. The band's record label has attempted to distance the band from the "darkwave" label through inclusion in a series of compilations entitled ''Highlights of Lightwave''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.discogs.com/DVAR-Highlights-Of-Lightwave-Vol1/release/1822197 Discogs.com - DVAR – Highlights Of Lightwave Vol.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist E.O.M.†.A.K.E.K made an album titled ''A Tribute to Dvar''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eomtakek.bandcamp.com/album/a-tribute-to-dvar A Tribute To Dvar.]&lt;/ref&gt; Russian group Draw has released three albums with covers very similar to those of Dvar, believed to be either a tribute to Dvar or a mockery of Dvar.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Dvar's vocals have appeared in some of Caprice's songs, mainly "Kywitt Kywitt" and "Fae Fae Fae Fae Fae Fae Fae".{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Identity==
Dvar has kept their identities secret, including their hometown, their ages, or exactly how many band members there are. However, Dvar is presumed to be a duo. This has led to many impostors claiming that they either are Dvar or know the identities of the band members. One rumor claimed that Dvar was [[Michael Jackson]]'s secret project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jackson.tvheaven.com/ Hands Off From Michael&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and that Dvar's members are patients in a mental institution. The band itself claims that Dvar is something "[[supernatural]]" that is delivered through them to share with the world.

[[File:EdmondRoalNavyPOfficer.jpg|thumb|right|Edmond Wilhelm Brillant at [[Port Said]], Egypt, in 1942]]

'''Edmond Wilhelm Brillant the Levi''' ({{lang-he|אדמונד וילהלם ברילנט}}; 1916–2004) was a Polish-born Israeli naval architect, [[Hagana]] member, among the founding fathers of the [[Israeli navy]] and was notable for assisting the Israeli Merchant Marine in several major projects, including the nations' first passenger liner, {{SS|Shalom||6}} through the ZIM Navigation company, now [[Zim Integrated Shipping Services]]. He dedicated his greatest efforts to building up the young states' maritime capability, both civil and military. Brillant was born in [[Jaroslaw]] [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], [[Poland]], and was the youngest of the four sons &lt;ref name=Karol&gt;{{cite web|url=http://db.yadvashem.org/names/nameDetails.html?itemId=3939170&amp;language=en |title= Karol Brillant |publisher= Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Center Israel |accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the famous pharmacist [[Wiktor Brillant]] &lt;ref name=WIKTOR1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poia.pl/historia/pdf/apteki.jaroslawskie.pdf |title= Historia Aptek Jarosławskich |publisher=Zbigniew Biliński |language=Polish |year=2008|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WIKTOR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://db.yadvashem.org/names/nameDetails.html?itemId=918424&amp;language=en |title= Wiktor Brillant |publisher= Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Center Israel |accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Laura Brillant (née Sturmlauf).&lt;ref name=Laura&gt;{{cite web|url=http://db.yadvashem.org/names/nameDetails.html?itemId=1118771&amp;language=en |title= Laura Brillant |publisher= Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Center Israel |accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brillant was a flight amateur and joined the gliding club of Jaroslaw at the age of 13.&lt;ref name=YNET/&gt; There he studied building gliders, aircraft, gliding and flight.

Brillant graduated from the [[August Witkowski]] [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (high school&lt;ref&gt;At present, named {{illm|August Witkowski Complex of Schools of Road Building, Surveying and General Education in Jarosław|PL|Zespół Szkół Drogowo-Geodezyjnych i Licealnych im. Augusta Witkowskiego w Jarosławiu}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in Jaroslaw in 1934, and started his MD studies. However, since he had a strong technical aptitude, Brillant started learning precision mechanics in [[Lviv]]. He immigrated to [[Israel]] (then [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]) in 1936 on board of {{illm|SS Polonia|WD=Q1793234}} from [[Port of Constanţa]] with a [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|Hebrew Technion]] [[Gathering of Israel#Zionist vision|Certificate]], and resided in [[Haifa]].

==Hagana Service==
[[File:Edmond Pluga PPRD.jpg|thumb|left|PPRD Railway Company C of Hagana Haifa, 1939 – Edmond Brillant is in the first row on the right, with a pistol]]
Brillant started his mechanical engineering studies in the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|Hebrew Technion]], and in 1937 he joined the Hagana Flight Club in “Kfar Yeladim” at [[Jezreel Valley]] as an instructor. The Kfar Yeladim flight club was the early seed of the Hagana for creating an air-arm, later became the Israeli Air-Force,  under the guise of a gliding club. In 1938, he volunteered in the Palestine Police Railway Department (PPRD) of the [[Hagana]] [[Jewish Settlement Police|Ghaffirs]] of the [[Jewish Supernumerary Police]], and escorted trains from Zemach at the [[Sea of Galilee]] to [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]]. During service in the [[Jezreel Valley railway|PPRD]], he was wounded when his train was damaged by a mine placed by terrorists during the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab rebellion of 1936-1939]]. He discharged himself from hospital and returned to his company.&lt;ref name=YNET&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3192074,00.html |script-title=he:ברילנט איש הים, היבשה והאוויר |publisher=YNET |date=30 December 2005 |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service in the Royal Navy==
As [[World War II]] started, Brillant wanted to volunteer to join the [[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)|Buffs]], but had [[typhoid]] and instead joined the Royal Navy as [[Chief Petty Officer]] in role of [[Engine Room Artificer]] (ERA) in 1942. Brillant was among the Jewish Hagana Volunteers to the [[Royal Navy]], and served there till March 1946.&lt;ref name=YNET/&gt;&lt;ref name=RNVRUN&gt;{{cite web |last=Pfeffer |first=Anshel |url=http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/911850.html  |title= Israeli WWII veterans honored for service to Royal Navy |work=Haaretz |date=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brillant served in the Red-Sea Theater aboard [[Her Majesty's Ship|HMS]] [[Massawa]] at [[Eritrea]] and other naval bases.&lt;ref name="YNET"/&gt; Prior the takeover of Masawa by the Allies, the base was an Axis stronghold of the [[Regia Marina]] (the then Italian Navy). It was a bay which served as a harbor and shipyard with docking, thus was a strategic port for the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=READM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardellsberg.com/ |title=Edward Ellsberg|publisher=Ted Pollard|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Italians started to retreat, they [[Scuttling|scuttle]]d their ships. [[Marine salvage|Salvage]] work was done by the [[United States Navy]]'s Jewish Navy Officer, Commander [[Edward Ellsberg]].&lt;ref name=READM/&gt; His team was replaced later on by the Royal Navy. There, Brillant started to learn salvage work, shallow water diving, diesel engines and other naval professions that assisted him later on in his Israeli Navy career.&lt;ref name=YNET/&gt;

During Brillant's service in HMS Massawa became a pilot’s duties volunteer. Brillant's commanding officers at HMS Massawa recommended him to be commissioned&lt;ref name=YNET/&gt; and assisted him to reach aviator trainings of the RN [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) in 1944. His pilot duties were disallowed, since the Ministry of Colonies did not allow access to aviation training for Jewish volunteers from Palestine.&lt;ref name=YNET/&gt; In his file, it was written that Brillant's engineering skills were of  'great importance' to the Navy.&lt;ref name=YNET/&gt;

Even though Brillant was disqualified from Royal Navy pilot duties, he continued serving and did not answer the U.S. Navy requests to join them as an officer.&lt;ref name=YNET/&gt;

After his release from the Navy, he returned to the Hagana and joined the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) Naval Forces.

==Israeli Naval Forces==
[[File:Edmond and Rosita.jpg|thumb|right|Edmond Brillant and his wife Rosita Segal]]

Brillant joined the Hagana [[Palyam|Harbor Platoon]], which later on became the [[Shayetet 13|Flotilla 13]] Navy commando unit, and took part in several of their operations. During this time, Brillant took part in converting the clandestine immigration ships of Hagana into first improvised Israeli Navy ships for the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|War of Independence]].&lt;ref name=YNET/&gt; This work was camouflaged since the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] only left Haifa harbor in June 1948.

Brillant founded the damage control branch and the special salvage unit and special under water operations called [[Sayeret|YALTAM]]. He established the damage control floating fighting, and fire fighting training that each navy officer and sailor has to pass.&lt;ref name=YNET/&gt;

Brillant served as a naval [[Staff (military)]] officer, and during his service he was the operational planner of the 1956 sea battle in which the Egyptian destroyer [[Ibrahim el Awal]] was captured.

He analyzed the air attack and navy operation of both the French and Israelis, and his report was submitted to Lt General [[Moshe Dayan]] as well as the French military staff.&lt;ref name=YNET/&gt;

Brillant also improved the conversion time of reserve fishing boats to patrol boats from 3 days into few hours.&lt;ref name=YNET/&gt;

==In ZIM Navigation Company==
[[File:SHALOM14 SHIPYARDS-EDMOND-LEFT 1963.jpg|thumb|left|125px|SS ''Shalom'' Project, Chantiers de l'Atlantique, 1963 – Edmond Brillant at the left]]

Brillant was borrowed from the Navy by ZIM&lt;ref name="YNET"/&gt; in order to lead three projects of merchant marine ship building.&lt;ref name=YNET/&gt; 
He moved to [[France]], and led the {{SS|Shalom||6}} project in [[Chantiers de l'Atlantique]]. This ship was the largest passenger ship of ZIM and was the flagship. After then, he moved to [[Toulon]] to manage the building of three freight ships: ''Keshet'' (Bow), ''Noga'' (Venus) and ''Mazal'' (Luck).&lt;ref name=YNET/&gt;

In 1963, Brillant asked the IDF attaché in Paris for permission to retire from the Navy, even though they requested him to continue his service for the vital naval operation known as the [[Cherbourg Project]].

In 1969, while he was a technical superintendent in ZIM Europe lines, Brillant organised and led  the logistic and technical effort behind the fueling of the 5 [[Sa'ar 3 class missile boat]]s that escaped Cherbourg Harbour in operation [[Cherbourg Project|Noah]].&lt;ref name=YNET/&gt; The fuelling- freight ships that were modified by him were MV ''Lea'' to fuel in Gibraltar and MV ''Nahariyah'' as a backup in the [[Bay of Biscay]].&lt;ref name=YNET/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2425">'''Emmanuel Habyarimana''' is a former [[Rwanda]]n soldier and politician.

Habyarimana, an ethnic [[Hutu]], was a former member of the [[Rwandan Armed Forces]] in the Hutu-dominated state of [[Juvénal Habyarimana]].  Following the successful conquest of Rwanda by the [[Rwandese Patriotic Front|RPF]], he joined the newly constituted [[Rwandan Defence Forces]] and held the rank of [[colonel]].

In 1997 he was made Minister of State for Defence in the Rwandan government.  In 2000, he became Rwanda's Minister of Defence, and was later sometime afterwards promoted to Brigadier-General.  While serving in this position he played a significant part in Rwanda's actions in the [[Second Congo War]].&lt;ref name=bbc20010803a&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1472117.stm

In November 2002 he was removed from his post as Minister of Defence, which government spokesperson Joseph Bideri attributed to his "extreme pro-Hutu" views.&lt;ref name=bbc20030401a&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2905501.stm

==Early life==
Gautam Adani was born on 24 June 1962 in a Bania family to Shantilal and Shanti Adani in [[Ahmedabad]], Gujarat. He had 7 siblings and his parents had migrated from the town of Tharad in the northern part of Gujarat. His father was a textile merchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=

He was educated at Sheth Chimanlal Nagindas Vidyalaya school in Ahmedabad. He enrolled in a bachelor's degree in commerce at [[Gujarat University]], but dropped out after the second year.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Adani was keen on business, but not his father's textile business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/transnational-indian-business-in-the-twentieth-century/6B6236551634D106A0E65880574D7373/core-reader# |title= Transnational Indian Business in the Twentieth Century |author= Cambridge Core |date= 2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Career==
In 1978, as a teenager, Adani moved to Mumbai to work as a diamond sorter for Mahendra Brothers. He worked there for 2-3 years before establishing his own diamond brokerage firm at [[Zaveri Bazaar]], Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/transnational-indian-business-in-the-twentieth-century/6B6236551634D106A0E65880574D7373/core-reader#|title=Business Journal|date=2017-12-12|website=[[cambridge]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1981, his elder brother Mansukhbhai Adani bought a plastics unit in Ahmedabad and invited him to manage the operations. This venture turned out to be Adani's gateway to global trading through [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://business.mapsofindia.com/business-leaders/gautam-adani.html|title=Gautam Adani Biography|date=2015-06-02|publisher=Businessmapsofindia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1985, he started importing primary polymers for small scale industries. In 1988, Adani established Adani Exports Limited, now known as Adani Enterprises Limited - the holding company of the Adani Group. Originally, the company dealt in agricultural and power commodities.&lt;ref name="Gautam Adani"&gt; {{cite news|url=//https://business.mapsofindia.com/business-leaders/gautam-adani.html|title=Gautam Adani Biography|date=2015-06-02|publisher=Businessmapsofindia}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the economic liberalization policies turned out to be favorable for his company and he started expanding the businesses into trading of metals, textiles, and agro products.{{fact|date=September 2018}}
 
In 1993, the [[Government of Gujarat]] announced managerial outsourcing of the [[Mundra Port]] and in 1995, Adani got the contract.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |url=//https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/Gautam-Adani-the-baron-to-watch-out-for-if-Narendra-Modi-becomes-king/articleshow/33521536.cms|title=Gautam Adani|date=2014-04-10|publisher=[[timesofindia]]}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, he set up the first jetty. Originally operated by Mundra Port &amp; Special Economic Zone, the operations were transferred to [[Adani Ports &amp; SEZ Limited]] (APSEZ). Today, the company is the largest private multi-port operator. Mundra Port is the largest private sector port in India, with the capacity of handling close to 210 million tons of cargo per annum.{{fact|date=September 2018}}
 
In 1996, the power business arm of the Adani Group – Adani Power Limited was founded by Adani. Adani Power holds thermal power plants with a capacity of 4620 MW, the largest private thermal power producer of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=//https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/abb-links-648-mw-solar-project-at-kamuthi-with-national-grid/articleshow/52728908.cms|title=Adani Solar Project|date=2016-06-13|publisher=economictimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2006, Adani entered the Power generation business. From 2009 to 2012, he acquired Carmichael Coal in Queensland and Abbot Point Port in Australia.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|url=https://www.outlookbusiness.com/specials/the-boss/gautam-adani-1237|title=Gautam Adani, chairman Adani group|date=2015-07-10|publisher=outlookbusiness.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal Life==
Adani is married to Priti Adani.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://business.mapsofindia.com/business-leaders/gautam-adani.html|title=Gautam Adani |date=2015-06-02|website=mapsofindia.com}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|url=https://ahmedabadmirror.indiatimes.com/columns/the-informer/achtung-baby/articleshow/53066653.cms|title=Priti Adani|date=2016-07-07|website=ahmedabadmirror}} &lt;/ref&gt; He likes to read, especially books by [[Robin Sharma]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wealthx.com/dossier/gautam-shantilal-adani/| title=Gautam Adani|website=wealthx.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
During the time of 2014 [[Loksabha]] elections of India, Adani was accused of various controversies. He was being accused of supporting [[Narendra Modi]] for his campaign in [[Bharatiya Janata Party]].&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Home/Lok-Sabha-Elections-2014/News/Allegations-political-didnt-get-land-at-Re-1-from-Modi-Adani/articleshow/34340833.cms |title=Allegations political, didn't get land at Re 1 from Modi: Adani |publisher=The Times of India |date=28 April 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though claiming on national media that he has no special favors with Modi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=PTI |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/adani-says-got-no-special-favours-from-narendra-modi/ |title=Gautam Adani denies any special favours from Modi |publisher=The Indian Express |date=27 April 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modi was seen traveling on Adani group's chartered planes to rallies across India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Modi-flies-only-on-Gujarat-Inc-money/articleshow/2413018.cms |title=Modi flies only on Gujarat Inc. money |publisher=The Times of India |date=29 September 2007 |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1zcrzn/can_someone_explain_why_modi_is_using_adanis/ |title=Can someone explain why Modi is using Adani's private jet? |publisher=Reddit.com |date=2 March 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counter this allegation, Adani spoke out in an interview with CNBC and clarified that the BJP paid market price to [[Adani Group]] for using its aviation services.&lt;ref name="onlinenewsvideo.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinenewsvideo.net/gautam-adani-interview_ff993659f.html |title=GAUTAM ADANI INTERVIEW Youtube HD Video Online |publisher=Onlinenewsvideo.net |date=28 April 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It was alleged that the NDA government was favouring Adani by allegedly waiving Rs. 200 crore fine on Adani Port and SEZ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyo.in/politics/gautam-adani-narendra-modi-vibrant-gujarat-corruption-acche-din-mundra-project-sbi-coal-mining-chhattisgarh-tribal-rights-rs-200-crore/story/1/11531.html |title=Modi government cancels Rs 200cr penalty: Achhe din for Adani only? |publisher=Dailyo.in |date=3 July 2016 |accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adani, later, in an interview clarified the fine has not been dropped and the government is not favouring Adani either.&lt;ref name="indianexpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/gautam-adani-interview-bjp-narendra-modi-mining-aircraft-politics-congress-jairam-ramesh-elections-2906300/ |title=Gautam Adani: We don't seek special favours from BJP or any individual |publisher=The Indian Express |date=11 July 2016 |accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further clarified that the mine is owned by Rajasthan Government, and Adani Group is just the mine contractor.&lt;ref name="indianexpress1"/&gt;

'''George Onions''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (2 March 1883 &amp;ndash; 2 April 1944) was an [[England|English]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces.

Onions first served with the [[3rd Hussars]] and was involved in the [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin in 1916.

Onions was 35 years old, and a [[Lance-Corporal]] in the 1st Battalion, [[The Devonshire Regiment]], [[British Army]] during the [[World War I|First World War]] when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On the foggy morning of 22 August 1918, south of [[Achiet-le-Petit]], [[France]], Lance-Corporal Onions was sent out with Private Henry Eades to reconnoitre the area in front of his unit's position. They saw the enemy advancing in large numbers and, seizing the opportunity, they boldly placed themselves on the flank of the advancing enemy and opened fire. When the enemy were about 100 yards from them the line wavered and some hands were thrown up, whereupon the lance-corporal rushed forward and helped by his comrade, took about 200 of the enemy prisoners and marched them back to his company commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31067|date=13 December 1918 |page=14778|supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private Eades was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal but died of wounds that he received only a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://livesofthefirstworldwar.org/lifestory/4980318 |title=lifestory of Private Henry Eades |access-date=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keepmilitarymuseum.org/info/lance+corporal+george+onions+vc |title=Biography of Lance Corporal George Onions, from the website of The Keep Military Museum|access-date=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was later commissioned into the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|Rifle Brigade]]. After World War I, Onions served in the [[Auxiliary Division]] of the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]].&lt;ref&gt;A D Harvey, "Who Were the Auxiliaries?"  ''Historical Journal'' 35, no. 3 (1992): 665-69.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 he was commissioned a [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]] in the [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]] for National Defence, but resigned his commission in 1941.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at [[The Keep, Dorchester|The Keep Military Museum]], Dorchester, Dorset, England.

== Autobiography ==

In Spring of 2008, ghostwriter Ken Scott was introduced to Horace Greasley, aged 89, so he could finally have his World War II memoirs recorded. Scott stated that he only acted as Horace's fingers to type the book as Horace suffered from extreme arthritis.&lt;ref name="Greasley, Horace 2008"&gt;Greasley, Horace (2008). Do the Birds Still Sing in Hell?. Libros International. pp. Synopsis. {{ISBN|978-1905988808}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was finished and published by the end of 2008 by Libros International, and gives Greasley's account of his decision to go to war, his capture, struggles, near-death experiences, brutality of the SS, the unique love of Rosa Rauchbach, the escapes, and his liberation.&lt;ref name="Greasley, Horace 2008"/&gt;

Guy Walters has criticised the book for exaggerating the dangers which Greasley faced stating, "Working camps for NCOs such as Greasley were not the tightly-guarded places conjured up by our collective imagination, which is weaned on images from [[Colditz Castle#Use as POW camp|Colditz]] and [[Stalag Luft III|The Great Escape]]. In fact, bunking out of one's camp to fraternise with local girls was hardly unusual, and certainly not 'escaping' in the sense most of us understand it."&lt;ref name="DailyMail" /&gt;

==Himmler photograph==
[[File:Himmler inspects POW camp.jpg|thumb|right|The disputed photograph, claimed by some to include Greasley]]
The February 2010 Telegraph obituary&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt; published a photograph&lt;ref name="thesundaytimes.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="leicestermercury.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/course-s-Horace-photo-Himmler/story-17815382-detail/story.html |title='Of course that's my Horace in photo of Himmler' |newspaper=[[Leicester Mercury]] |date=10 January 2013 |first=Laura |last=Elvin |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; captioned "Greasley confronting Heinrich Himmler (wearing the spectacles) in the POW camp".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.ru/search?q=horace%20greasley%20himmler&amp;newwindow=1&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qcqcUva3FYHl4gSQzIHIBg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=501#newwindow=1&amp;q=horace%20greasley%20himmler%20telegraph&amp;tbm=isch&amp;facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=ORtoGTP8C15ooM:;mcx3Ipo9YKcVdM;http%253A%252F%252Fi.telegraph.co.uk%252Fmultimedia%252Farchive%252F02376%252Fhorace_2376454b.jpg;http%253A%252F%252Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%252Fculture%252Ffilm%252F9627322%252FBritish-PoW-escaped-200-times-to-meet-German-lover.html;620;387|title=horace greasley himmler – Поиск в Google|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photograph and its description was republished by other news sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/horace-greasley-british-prisoner-of-war-1393453 |title=The great escapist: Film to celebrate British prisoner of war who broke out of Nazi camp 200 times.. to meet girl |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |date=23 October 2012 |first=Martin |last=Fricker |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2221840/British-prisoner-war-fled-Nazi-camp-200-times-meet-German-sweetheart.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=The greatest escapist: British prisoner of war fled Nazi camp 200 times to meet his German sweetheart |first=William |last=Cook |date=23 October 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Guy Walters]] asserted categorically that the soldier in the picture was not Greasley, stating that the picture is held by the US National Archives and the caption details show it was taken in Minsk (in Belarus) in mid-1941, that it was taken by a photographer for a propaganda film and identifies the soldier as Soviet from his cap, and that the officers in the picture are the same officers who appear in the film with Himmler.&lt;ref name="leicestermercury.co.uk"/&gt;

==Early life==
Bird was born on 15 October 1831 at [[Boroughbridge]] Hall, Yorkshire, the home of her maternal grandmother and her father's first curacy after taking orders in 21. Her parents were Rev Edward Bird BA (1794–1858) and his second wife, Dora Lawson (1803–1866).&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; 

Bird moved several times during her childhood. In 1832, Reverend Bird was appointed curate in [[Maidenhead]]. Because of her father's ill health Bird's family moved again in 1834 to [[Tattenhall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lucas, Charles Prestwood |title=Bishop, Isabella Lucy |publisher=Dictionary of National Biography |year=1912 |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bishop,_Isabella_Lucy_%28DNB12%29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216110157/https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bishop%2C_Isabella_Lucy_%28DNB12%29 |archivedate=16 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Cheshire]], a living presented to him by his cousin Dr [[John Bird Sumner]], Bishop of Chester, where in the same year Bird's sister, Henrietta, was born.
 
Bird was outspoken from an early age. When six years old, she confronted the local [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[South Cheshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Cheshire]]: "[[Sir Philip Grey Egerton, 10th Baronet|Sir Malpas de Grey Tatton Egerton]], while he was campaigning, asking him "did you tell my father my sister was so pretty because you wanted his vote?"&lt;ref name="Stoddart"/&gt;

Edward Bird's controversial views against Sunday labour caused his congregation to dwindle, and in 1842 he requested a transfer to St. Thomas's in [[Birmingham]]. Here again objections were raised which culminated in the minister's being pelted "with stones, mud, and  insults".

In 1848, the family moved again and, after spending some time in [[Eastbourne]], took up residence in [[Wyton, Cambridgeshire|Wyton]] in Huntingdonshire (now Cambridgeshire.)&lt;ref name="Stoddart"&gt;Stoddart, Anna M, (1906) ''The Life of Isabella Bird, Mrs Bishop'' : London, J. Murray OCLC  4138739&lt;/ref&gt;

From early childhood Bird was frail, suffering from a spinal complaint, nervous headaches, and insomnia. The doctor recommended an open-air life,&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; and consequently, Bird learned to ride in infancy, and later to row. Her only education came from her parents: her father was a keen botanist who instructed Bird in flora, and her mother taught her daughters an eclectic mix of subjects. Bird became an avid reader.&lt;ref name="Stoddart"/&gt;  However, her "bright intelligence, [and] an extreme curiosity as to the world outside, made it impossible for her brain and her nature generally to be narrowed and stiffened by the strictly evangelical atmosphere of her childhood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Life of Isabella Bird|journal=The Spectator|date=26 January 1907|pages=6|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bird's first publication was at the age of 16, a pamphlet addressing Free Trade v Protectionism after which she continued writing articles for various periodicals.&lt;ref name="Times Obit"/&gt;

In 1850, a "fibrous tumour was removed from the neighbourhood of the spine". Bird continued to suffer from unspecified ailments resulting in lassitude and insomnia. The family spent six summers in Scotland in an effort to improve her health.

Doctors urged a sea voyage and in 1854 Bird's life of travelling began when the opportunity arose for her to sail to the United States accompanying her second cousins to their family home. Her father "gave her [£]100 and leave to stay away as long as it lasted".&lt;ref name="Stoddart"/&gt;  Bird's "bright descriptive letters"&lt;ref name="Times Obit"/&gt; written home to her relations formed the basis for her first book, ''An Englishwoman in America'' (1856),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Englishwoman in America|year=1856|publisher=John Murray OCLC 169934144|author=Bird, Isabella L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; published by [[John Murray (publisher)|Murray]]. John Murray, "as well as being Isabella's lifelong publisher, ... [became] one of her closest friends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Travels with Isabella Bird (transcript) |url=http://www.nls.uk/about-us/films-made-by-nls/isabella-bird-transcript |publisher=National Library of Scotland |accessdate=17 March 2014 |author=David McClay |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317211905/http://www.nls.uk/about-us/films-made-by-nls/isabella-bird-transcript |archivedate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travels in middle life==
[[File:Isabella Bird Bishop Manchurian.jpg|thumb|left|Isabella Bird wearing Manchurian clothing from a journey through China.]] Bird left Britain again in 1872, going initially to [[Australia]], which she disliked, and then to [[Hawaii]] (known in Europe as the Sandwich Islands), her love for which prompted her second book (published three years later). While there she climbed [[Mauna Kea]] and [[Mauna Loa]].&lt;ref name=bird&gt;{{cite news|author=Bird, Isabella |title=Biographical Note|work=The Hawaiian Archipelago|publisher= eBooks|date=2004|page= i}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then moved on to [[Colorado]], then the newest state in the USA, where she had heard the air was excellent for the infirm. Dressed practically and riding not sidesaddle but frontwards like a man (though she threatened to sue the ''Times'' for saying she dressed like one), she covered over 800 miles in the [[Rocky Mountains]] in 1873. Her letters to her sister, first printed in the magazine ''[[The Leisure Hour]]'',&lt;ref name=bird/&gt; comprised Bird's fourth and perhaps most famous book, ''[[A Lady's Life in the Rocky Mountains]]''.

Bird's time in the Rockies was enlivened especially by her acquaintance with Jim Nugent, "[[Rocky Mountain Jim]]", a textbook outlaw with one eye and an affinity for violence and poetry. "A man any woman might love but no sane woman would marry", Bird declared in a section excised from her letters before their publication.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Nugent also seemed captivated by the independent-minded Bird, but she ultimately left the Rockies and her "dear desperado". Nugent was shot dead less than a year later.

[[File:PSM V34 D092 Ainu of yezo.jpg|thumb|upright|The illustration of two [[Ainu people|Ainu]] men, originally from her 1880 book ''Unbeaten Tracks in [[Japan]]'']]
At home, Bird again found herself pursued, this time by Dr John Bishop, an [[Edinburgh]] surgeon in his thirties. She got interested in Japan through Colin Alexander McVean's account and asked him advise and convenience in February 1878, then went travelling again, this time to Asia: [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Singapore]], and [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. When her sister Henrietta Amelia Bird died of [[typhoid]] in 1880, Bird accepted John Bishop's marriage proposal. They were married in February 1881, and later that year she was awarded the Royal Order of Kapiolani by King Kalākaua of Hawaii.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Bird's health took a severe turn for the worse but, other than a spell of scarlet fever in 1888, it recovered following John Bishop's death in 1886, at which point she inherited a large amount of disposable income. Feeling that her earlier travels had been hopelessly dilettante, Bird studied medicine and resolved to travel as a [[missionary]]. Despite being nearly 60 years of age, she set off for [[India]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Later life==
[[File:Korea and Her Neighbours.png|thumb|upright|''Korea and Her Neighbours'' (1898)]]
Arriving on the subcontinent in February 1889, Bird visited missions in [[India]], visited [[Ladakh]] on the borders of [[Tibet]], and then travelled in [[Persia]], [[Kurdistan]], and [[Turkey]]. In India, the Maharajah of Kashmir gave her a piece of land on which to build a hospital with sixty beds and a dispensary for women; there she worked with [[Fanny Jane Butler]] to found the John Bishop Memorial Hospital in memory of her recently deceased husband who had left funds for this purpose in his will. The following year, she joined a group of British soldiers travelling between [[Baghdad]] and [[Tehran]]. She remained with the unit's commanding officer during his survey work in the region, armed with her revolver and a medicine chest supplied – in possibly an early example of corporate sponsorship – by [[Henry Wellcome]]'s company in [[London]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In 1891, she travelled through Baluchistan to Persia and Armenia, exploring the source of the Karun river and later that year she gave a speech in a committee room of the House of Commons on the persecution of Christians in Kurdistan, on which she had made representations to the Grand Vizier of the Turkish Empire.

Featured in journals and magazines for decades, Bird was by now something of a household name. In 1890, she became the first woman to be awarded the Honorary Fellowship of the [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society]]. Two years later, she became the first woman allowed to join the [[Royal Geographical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Admission of Women Fellows to the Royal Geographical Society, 1892-1914; the Controversy and the Outcome|jstor = 3059652|journal = The Geographical Journal|date = 1996-01-01|pages = 295–312|volume = 162|issue = 3|doi = 10.2307/3059652|first = Morag|last = Bell|first2 = Cheryl|last2 = McEwan}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was elected to membership of the [[Royal Photographic Society]] on 12 January 1897. Her final great journey took place in 1897, when she travelled up the [[Yangtze]] and [[Han River (Korea)|Han]] rivers in [[China]] and [[Korea]], respectively. Later still, she went to [[Morocco]], where she travelled among the [[Berber people|Berbers]] and had to use a ladder to mount her black stallion, a gift from the Sultan.&lt;ref name=bird/&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Veneration of the grave of Isabella Bird, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh (Chaos Project).jpg|thumb|left|Veneration of the grave of Isabella Bird, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh]]
A few months after returning from a trip to Morocco, Bird fell ill and died at her home on 16 Melville Street&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1904&lt;/ref&gt;, Edinburgh on 7 October 1904. She was buried with her family in [[Dean Cemetery]] in the west of the city. The grave lies in the small curved southern section, near the small path which divides it in two.

She was planning another trip to China at the time of her death.

==Legacy==
The first biography of Bird was written by Anne M Stoddart and published in 1907.

[[Caryl Churchill]] used Bird as a character in her play ''[[Top Girls]]'' (1982). Much of the dialogue written by Churchill comes from Bird's own writings.

Bird was featured in ''Bedrock: Writers on the Wonders of Geology'' (2006), edited by Lauret E. Savoy, [[Eldridge M. Moores]], and Judith E. Moores ([[Trinity University (Texas)#Trinity University Press|Trinity University Press]]) which looks at writing over the years and how it pays tribute to the Earth and its geological features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2006|authors=Savoy, Lauret E. &amp; [[Eldridge M. Moores|Moores, Eldridge M.]] &amp; Moores, Judith E. |publisher=Trinity University Press|location=TX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bird is also the main character of the manga ''[[Isabella Bird in Wonderland]]'' (''Fushigi no Kuni no Bird''), a novelization of her travels to Japan; it received a bilingual Japanese-English edition beginning in 2018.&lt;ref name=BakerBiling&gt;{{cite web|author=Baker, Bayleigh|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-01-22/isabella-bird-in-wonderland-manga-gets-bilingual-edition-in-japan/.126755|title=Isabella Bird in Wonderland Manga Gets Bilingual Edition in Japan|publisher=''[[Anime News Network]]''|date=2018-01-22|accessdate=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;


The building of the clock tower on [[Tobermory, Mull]] harbour wall was funded by Bird in memory of her beloved sister Henrietta. It was designed by mountaineer and explorer [[Edward Whymper]].&lt;ref name="Stoddart"/&gt; [[File:Tobermory clock tower.jpg|thumb|Clock tower in Tobermory built with funds donated by Isabella Lucy Bird]]

'''Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz''' (23 January 1751, or 12 January in the [[Julian calendar]]–4 June 1792, or 24 May in the Julian calendar) was a [[Baltic German]] writer of the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' movement.

==Life==
Lenz was born in [[Cesvaine|Sesswegen (Cesvaine)]], [[Governorate of Livonia]], [[Russian Empire]], now [[Latvia]], the son of the [[Pietism|pietistic]] minister Christian David Lenz (1720–1798), later General Superintendent of Livonia. When Lenz was nine, in 1760, the family moved to [[Tartu|Dorpat]], now Tartu, where his father had been offered a minister's post. His first published poem appeared when he was 15. From 1768 to 1770 he studied theology on a scholarship, first at Dorpat and then at [[Königsberg]]. While there, he attended lectures by [[Immanuel Kant]], who encouraged him to read [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. He began increasingly to follow his literary interests and to neglect theology. His first independent publication, the long poem ''Die Landplagen'' (''"Torments of the Land"'') appeared in 1769. He also studied music, most likely with either the Ukrainian virtuoso [[lutanist]] [[Timofey Belogradsky]], then resident in Königsberg, or his student [[Johann Friedrich Reichardt]].

In 1771 Lenz abandoned his studies in Königsberg. Much against the will of his father, who on that account broke off contact with him, he took a position little better than that of a servant with [[Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf|Friedrich Georg]] and Ernst Nikolaus von Kleist ([http://www.v-kleist.com/FG/Muttrin/fg0091.htm]), barons from [[Courland]] and officer cadets about to begin their military service, whom he accompanied to [[Strasbourg]]. Once there, he came into contact with the [[actuary]] Johann Daniel Salzmann, around whom had formed the literary group of the ''Société de philosophie et de belles lettres''. This was frequented also by the young [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who at this time happened to be in Strasbourg, and whose acquaintance Lenz made, as well as that of [[Johann Heinrich Jung|Johann Heinrich Jung-Stilling]]. Goethe now became Lenz's literary idol, and through him he made contact with [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Johann Kaspar Lavater]], with whom he corresponded.

In the following year, 1772, Lenz accompanied his masters to the garrisons of [[Landau]], [[Fort-Louis|Fort Louis]] and [[Wissembourg]]. He also fell in love with [[Friederike Brion]], once the beloved of Goethe, but his feelings were not reciprocated.

In 1773 Lenz returned to Strasbourg and resumed his studies. The following year he gave up his position with the von Kleist brothers and lived as a freelance writer, earning his living by private tutoring. His relations with Goethe became friendlier: while the two of them were visiting [[Emmendingen]], Goethe introduced Lenz to his sister Cornelia and her husband Johann Georg Schlosser.

In April 1776 Lenz followed Goethe to the court of [[Weimar]], where he was at first amicably received. But in early December, on Goethe's instigation, he was expelled. The exact circumstances are not recorded; Goethe, who broke off all personal contact with him after this, refers only vaguely in his diary to "Lenz's asininity" (''"Lenzens Eseley"'').

Lenz then returned to Emmendingen, where the Schlossers took him in. From there he made a number of journeys into [[Alsace]] and [[Switzerland]], including one to Lavater in [[Zürich]] in May 1777. The news of Cornelia Schlosser's death, which reached him there in June of that year, had a powerful effect on him. He returned to Emmendingen, and then went back to Lavater. In November, while staying in [[Winterthur]] with Christoph Kaufmann, he suffered an attack of [[paranoid schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/18/jacob-lenz-review|title=Jakob Lenz - review|last=Clements|first=Andrew|date=2012-04-18|website=the Guardian|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1778 Kaufmann sent Lenz to the philanthropist, social reformer and clergyman [[Jean-Frédéric Oberlin|Johann Friedrich Oberlin]] in [[Waldersbach]] in Alsace, where he stayed from 20 January to 8 February. Despite the care of Oberlin and his wife, Lenz's mental condition grew worse. He returned to Schlosser at Emmendingen, where he was lodged with a shoemaker and then a forester.

His younger brother Karl fetched him in June 1779 from [[Hertingen]], where he was under treatment by a doctor, and brought him to [[Riga]], where their father by this time had risen to the position of General Superintendent.

Lenz was unable to establish himself professionally in Riga. An attempt to make him director of the cathedral school came to nothing, as Herder refused to give him a reference. Nor did he have any greater success in [[St. Petersburg]], where he lived from February to September 1780. He then took a position as a private tutor on an estate near Dorpat, then, after another stay in St. Petersburg, he went to Moscow in September 1781, where initially he stayed with the historian [[Friedrich Müller (historian)|Friedrich Müller]] and learned Russian.

He worked as a private tutor, mixed in the circles of Russian [[Freemasons]] and authors, and helped produce a number of reformist schemes. He also translated books on [[Russian history]] into German. His mental condition however was steadily deteriorating all the while, and at last he became entirely dependent on the goodwill of Russian patrons for the means of living.

In the early morning of 4 June 1792 (24 May in the Julian calendar) Lenz was found dead in a Moscow street. The place of his burial is unknown.

==Lenz as a literary figure==
''[[Lenz (fragment)|Lenz]]'', a novella fragment by [[Georg Büchner]], deals with Lenz's visit to the minister Friedrich Oberlin, in the [[Vosges]]. Lenz had visited Oberlin, on the suggestion of Kaufmann, because of his reputation as a pastor and psychologist. Oberlin's account of the events of Lenz's visit furnished Büchner with the source of his story, which in its turn was the source of [[Wolfgang Rihm]]'s [[chamber opera]] ''[[Jakob_Lenz_(opera)|Jakob Lenz]]''.

In Paul Celan's acceptance speech for the Georg Büchner Prize for Literature in 1960, both the historical man and the "Lenz" of Büchner's fragment figure heavily. In the first line of Büchner's novella, Lenz sets off for the mountains on 20 January. Celan relates this to the life of the poem, asking, "Perhaps one can say that every poem has its 20th of January?" He adds that the poem remains mindful of such dates. Celan also says of his work "Conversation in the Mountains," composed after a missed encounter with Adorno, that it was written from such a date: that he started writing from his own "20th of January."

More recently the writers Peter Schneider, in his story ''Lenz'' (1973), and Gert Hoffmann, in his novella ''Die Rückkehr des verlorenen J.M.R. Lenz nach Riga'' (''"The Return of the Lost J.M.R. Lenz to Riga"'', 1984), have given literary form to the events of his life.

Also worth mentioning is Marc Buhl's novel of 2002, ''Der rote Domino'' (''"The Red Domino"''), which uses the friendship between Goethe and Lenz, and its abrupt end, as the inspiration for a detective story.

Rogan had no intention of being a professional stand-up comedian and initially considered a career in kickboxing.&lt;ref name=shecky/&gt;&lt;ref name=herald1999/&gt; He was a fan of comedy as a youngster and his parents took him to see comedian [[Richard Pryor]]'s film ''[[Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip (film)|Live on the Sunset Strip]]'', which affected him "in such a profound way.

He secured his first major acting role in the 1994 nine-episode [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom ''[[Hardball (1994 TV series)|Hardball]]'' as Frank Valente, a young, ego-centric star player on a professional baseball team.&lt;ref name=shecky/&gt; Rogan called the hiring process "weird" as the network had no idea if he could act until he was asked by Dean Valentine, then-president of [[Walt Disney Television]], to which he replied: "If you can lie, you can act, and if you can lie to crazy girlfriends, you can act under pressure".&lt;ref name=shecky/&gt; The filming schedule was a new experience for Rogan who started to work 12-hour days and among people.&lt;ref name=chicago1994/&gt; Rogan later said: "It was a great show on paper until a horrible executive producer with a big ego was hired by Fox to run the show and he re-wrote it."&lt;ref name=shecky/&gt; Around this time, Rogan began performing at [[The Comedy Store]] in Hollywood and became a paid regular by owner [[Mitzi Shore]]. He performed at the club for the next 13 years for free, and paid for the venue's new sound system.&lt;ref name=rogan20070323/&gt;

Rogan later said that every single comic he had talked to was so happy and thankful he did it,&lt;ref name=rocky2007/&gt; and signed with [[William Morris Agency]] five minutes later.&lt;ref name=rogan20070323&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joerogan.net/blog/long-live-the-idea-of-the-comedy-store-the-last-word|title=Long Live the Idea of The Comedy Store, The Last Word.|publisher=JoeRogan.net|date=23 March 2007|first=Joe|last=Rogan|accessdate=5 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208142407/http://joerogan.net/blog/long-live-the-idea-of-the-comedy-store-the-last-word#|archive-date=February 8, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogan returned to The Comedy Store in 2013 when he supported Shaffir in the filming of his first special.

Rogan hosted the short lived CBS show ''[[Game Show in My Head]]'' that aired for eight episodes in January 2009 and produced by [[Ashton Kutcher]].&lt;ref name=cagepotato/&gt; The show involved contestants who try to convince people to perform or take part in increasingly bizarre situations for money. He agreed to host the show as the idea intrigued him, calling it "a completely mindless form of entertainment".&lt;ref name=herald2009&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-191431477.html|title=Rogan enjoys joshing on 'Game Show'|date=3 January 2009|magazine=The Boston Herald|first=Amy|last=Amatangelo|accessdate=3 February 2016|via=Highbeam Research|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, Rogan released his sixth comedy special ''Live from the Tabernacle'' exclusively as a download on his website for $5.

In 2013, Rogan hosted his own six-episode television show ''[[Joe Rogan Questions Everything]]'' on the [[SyFy]] network.

'''John Lawrence Gihon''' (April 21, 1839 – September 18, 1878) was a Philadelphia photographer, best known for establishing the [[Philadelphia Sketch Club]], documenting the [[American Civil War]], and producing one of the earliest baseball cards. He was a featured photographer at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition, contributing to the Philadelphia Photographer magazine, and author of the ''Photographic Colorists' Guide'', published in 1878.

==Early years==
John L. Gihon was born at [[Milford, New Jersey]] to parents Dr. John Hancock Gihon and Mary Jane Leary Gihon. His siblings were future Naval officer Albert L. Gihon and older sister Charlotte Gihon. The Gihon family moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania soon after John's birth. He attended grammar school at the Walnut Street School. In 1853, at age 14, Gihon was admitted to the Central High School.

In June 1855, he graduated at the top of his class and was subsequently nominated for admission to the United States Naval Academy. His nomination was secured by Representative Thomas Birch Florence and selected over 150 other applicants. John's brother was admitted the year previous. John Gihon's naval career was short lived. The Academy's board of surgeons rejected his application based on a "varicose condition."

In September 1856, John L. Gihon and his father headed to Lecompton, Kansas on the staff of the territorial governor, [[John W. Geary]]. His father, John H. Gihon, M.D., was the private secretary  to the governor. In 1858, Gihon was admittd into the life class of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Soon thereafter, Gihon befriended Edward R. Morgan, nephew of the well-known Philadelphia photographer Samuel Broadbent. The two youths soon became apprentices under Broadbent.

In 1859, Gihon and Morgan opened a photographic studio at 1024 Chestnut Street, "opposite the Academy of Fine Arts, and adjoining the St. Lawrence Hotel," according to an article in the ''Philadelphia Photographer'' magazine. In 1860, Gihon co-founded the [[Philadelphia Sketch Club]] on 125 South 11th Street in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Sketch Club is currently the oldest American artist organization still in existence.

==Civil War==
Around the start of the Civil War, for reasons unknown, Edward Morgan left the business at 1024 Chestnut Street, leaving Gihon the sole proprietor. While other photographers ventured to battlefields, Gihon followed a different path. In 1863, he obtained permission to photograph at nearby [[Fort Delaware]], a third-system fortification and wartime prison camp, which held more than 32,000 captured confederates.

On April 23, 1864, political prisoner Rev. Isaac W.K. Handy wrote that Gihon "was at work all day, in the casemates, photographing the faces of Confederate officers, and a few of the political prisoners. Special permission was granted by Gen. Schoepf, who selected the photographer, and sent for him, himself." By July 1864, he was granted access to the actual prison facility. Handy wrote that Gihon, "has been allowed to visit 'the pen' and has been busy, to-day, taking sundry pictures, to help the Yankee pockets, and bring joy to many a 'rebel' heart at the South."

The same day Confederate Army Capt. James Lile Lemmon, 18th Georgia Infantry, noted that the photographer "asked that we sit for our portraits &amp; after some debate among us we agreed as there was no harm in it, but my old uniform was in rags &amp; stained with blood &amp; ect &amp; unfit for a portrait &amp; I was glad that he had among his effects a few Confederate coats one of which I put on &amp; then set for him."

Gihon continued to photograph at Fort Delaware until 1870.

After that, he travelled to South America, and in 1873 the joined the photographic studio of [[Chute &amp; Brooks]], in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;Usos, itinerarios y protagonistas de la Fotografía en Uruguay. Centro de Fotografía de Montevideo, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in that country a couple of years and after that he travelled to Argentina and Venezuela.

==Later years and death==

In 1876, Gihon left his studio and joined the Centennial Photographic Co., which was solely responsible for documenting the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. In every issue of the 1877 ''Philadelphia Photographer'' included Gihon's column "Rambling Remarks" The same year Gihon ventured to Monvideo, Venezuela under a photographic contract with the Calle Mining Company. While there, Gihon fell to an unknown illness. In September 1878, he boarded a vessel bound for the states. On September 18, while two days out from New York harbor, he died. His obituary states he was buried at sea.

==Legacy==

In 2006, fifty of his images taken at Fort Delaware were placed on auction by Cowan Auctions, Inc. The image collection "bearing the fancy imprint of 'John L. Gihon's Art Galleries' sold for $86,000. The following year, an original 1870 Philadelphia Athletics BBC Team card sold for $6,960.

'''Karl Friedrich Geldner''' (17 December 1852 &amp;ndash; 5 February 1929) was a [[Germany|German]] [[linguist]] best known for his analysis and synthesis of [[Avestan]] and [[Vedic Sanskrit]] texts.

==Biography==
Geldner was born in [[Saalfeld]], [[Saxe-Meiningen]], where his father was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] clergyman.

Geldner studied [[Sanskrit]] and [[Avestan]] at the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1871 before moving to the [[University of Tübingen]] in 1872. He received a doctorate in Indological studies in 1875, and became a ''[[privatdozent]]'' following his ''[[habilitation]]'' in 1876. In 1887, Gelder moved back to the north-east, this time to [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], where he was appointed extraordinary professor in 1890, followed by an extraordinary faculty-chairmanship at the [[University of Berlin]] a few months later.

Geldner lectured in [[Berlin]] for 17 years. In 1907, he moved to the [[University of Marburg]] where he had been appointed ordinary professor. He retired from active teaching in 1921, and remained in [[Marburg]] until his death in 1929.

==Academic achievements==
Geldner's first significant publication, though made public only in 1877, was written while he was still a doctoral student. The essay, which was in its expanded and published form titled ''Über die Metrik des jüngeren Avesta'' ("On the meter of the Younger [[Avesta]]"), was originally an answer to a prize essay question posed by the University of Tübingen's Faculty of Philosophy. His analysis revealed that although the texts had not retained a metrical form, the majority of the manuscripts were in 8 syllable verse (10 or 12 syllable lines also occurred).

Although the theory was subsequently revised by others, Geldner's hypothesis was reinstated in 1983, and the lines of the Younger Avesta are today considered to be historically related to the [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] meters of the ''gayatri'' family. Unlike the meters of the [[Gathas]], which are recited, the meters of the Younger Avesta are mostly sung.

Although Geldner would have preferred to research the Vedas (he would later state to had "lost" 15 years working on the Avesta), following the publication of his doctoral thesis, Geldner began to work on a revision of Westergaard's edition of the Avesta. What he initially assumed would occupy him for only a few years, eventually took 20 and it was not until 1886 that the first volume was published. That first volume (the ''[[Yasna]]'') was followed by the ''[[Visperad]]'' and ''[[Khordeh Avesta]]'' in volume 2 (1889) and the [[Vendidad]] and [[wiktionary:Prolegomenon|Prolegomena]] in volume 3 (1895). Altogether, Geldner collated and documented over 120 manuscripts, and the greatest achievement of this laborious undertaking was "undoubtedly the Prolegomena, which provided an exact description of all manuscripts and their genealogical relationship" (so Schlerath, see [[#References|references]] below).

Although Gelder published several Avesta-related articles while working on the revision, following the publication of volume 3 he returned to work almost exclusively on Sanskrit texts. Only two publications after 1895 deal with Avestan topics. Together with [[Richard Pischel]] he began to work on the [[Vedas]], and their collaboration was subsequently published in the three volume ''Vedische Studien'' (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1889–1901), which - unlike previous translations - avoided a purely linguistic methodology and instead took indigenous tradition into account. Following his return to Marburg in 1907, Geldner dedicated his efforts to a translation of the [[RigVeda]], which was sent to his publisher in 1928 but did not reach the public until after the author's death in February 1929. The three volumes of his monumental ''Der Rig-Veda aus dem Sanskrit ins Deutsche übersetzt'' were finally released in 1951.

'''Katherine Esther Jackson''' (born '''Kattie B. Screws'''; May 4, 1930) is the matriarch of the [[Jackson family]].

==Early life==
Katherine Jackson was born Kattie B. Screws&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.biography.com/people/katherine-jackson-466952 Biography] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.jackson-source.com/the-jacksons/82-michael Jackson Source] &lt;/ref&gt; on May 4, 1930, in [[Clayton, Alabama]], to Prince Albert (October 16, 1907&amp;nbsp;– January 21, 1995) and Martha Screws (née Upshaw; December 14, 1902&amp;nbsp;– April 25, 1990). The elder of two daughters, Jackson contracted [[polio]] at age two, which left her with a noticeable permanent limp. In 1934, her father changed his surname to "Scruse", and renamed his daughter "Katherine Esther".&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.jackson-source.com/the-jacksons/82-michael Jackson Source] &lt;/ref&gt;  That year, Jackson's family moved to [[East Chicago, Indiana]], an industrial city in [[northwest Indiana]] near [[South Side, Chicago|Chicago]]. 

As a child, Jackson aspired to become an actress or [[country music|country singer]], but was dismayed to find no notable black country stars. Jackson's parents divorced when she was still a child. While attending [[Washington High School (East Chicago, Indiana)|Washington High School]], Jackson joined the local high school band. In 1947, Katherine met [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joseph Jackson]], also living in East Chicago. Joseph obtained an annulment of an earlier marriage and began dating Katherine. After a year-long courtship, they married on November 5, 1949. In January 1950, they purchased a two-bedroom house in Gary. During the couple's early years in Gary, they sang together, with Joe playing [[guitar]]. After Joe's dream of a [[boxing]] career was dashed, he continued working at nearby East Chicago's [[Inland Steel Company]]. From 1950 until 1966, Jackson gave birth to 10 children, including twins Marlon and Brandon, the latter of whom died a few hours after birth.

==Jackson family==
{{main|Jackson family|The Jackson 5}}

In the late 1950s, Jackson began working part-time as a store clerk in a local [[Sears]] in Gary. In 1963, Jackson, who was raised a [[Baptist]], became one of [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witnesses]]. In 1965, all of her children followed her into the faith. While Joe, who was brought up in the [[Lutheran]] faith, also practiced the religion, it was often said he decided not to change his faith. As Jackson's brood grew, she quit her position at Sears and settled primarily as a [[housewife]], keeping her children closer to home. By the early 1960s, several of Jackson's sons began to show off their musical talents. In 1963, Joe formed The Jackson Brothers with three of their eldest sons, [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], and [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]]. Around the same time, Jackson's younger son [[Michael Jackson|Michael]] was also showing off his talent, which was discovered first by Jackson, who noticed Michael, at the age of four, singing along to the radio while dancing to the rhythm. When she tried to tell Joe of Michael's talent, though, he brushed her aside, but she insisted.

A year later, Joe enlisted Michael and older brother [[Marlon Jackson]] into the group not as vocalists, but as backing instrumentalists, playing percussion. In 1966, Joe began to see seven-year-old Michael's overall talents three years after Jackson's discovery. Beforehand, Michael had performed onstage without his father's knowledge at several school recitals starting at five. By the end of 1966, Michael was positioned as the second front man of the group after Jermaine. Acting on advice from a schoolteacher, Joe changed the group's name to The Jackson Five. In 1967, after winning several talent shows in Gary, Joe Jackson decided to make the group a professional act when [[Gordon Keith (producer)|Gordon Keith]], an owner and vocalist at Gary's [[Steeltown Records]], discovered and signed them to their first contract with him on November 21. Their first single, "[[Big Boy (song)|Big Boy]]",&lt;ref&gt;Big Boy, 40th Anniversary http://www.jackson5abc.com/steeltown/&lt;/ref&gt; produced by Keith, was released on January 31, 1968.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.45rpmrecords.com/IN/Steeltown.php] 45 RPM Records &lt;/ref&gt; "Big Boy" became a local hit, playing on radio stations in the Chicago-Gary area. Jackson began designing the group's costumes, which she continued until the group found national fame months after signing with [[Motown Records]] in March 1969. During the Jackson 5's 1970–71 heyday, Jackson&amp;nbsp;– along with her three daughters and youngest son&amp;nbsp;– was barely mentioned in the press. This changed in 1974, when Joe began building careers around his three younger children and eldest daughter. Michael often mentioned Jackson lovingly. Jackson started to become part of her husband's management team when the grown-up members of the group (which renamed themselves The Jacksons after splitting from Motown in 1975) reunited for the [[Victory Tour (The Jacksons tour)|Victory Tour]] in 1984. Michael dedicated his 1982 album, ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'', to her. [[Janet Jackson]] did the same following the release of 1989's ''[[Rhythm Nation 1814]]'', the first album where she was not under the watchful eye of her father following the success of ''[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]'', as Janet had fired him months after its release. Michael often said that his mother was appreciative of his solo music and approved of songs such as "[[Billie Jean]]", but said she was cautious of Michael's mature material, including "[[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]]". In 1985, acknowledging what was then a positive impact on her children's successful music careers, national urban magazine ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' honored her as "Mother of the Year".

==''My Family''==
In 1990, Jackson released her autobiography, ''My Family, The Jacksons'',&lt;ref name=family&gt;{{cite book|title=My Family, the Jacksons|last=Jackson|first=Katherine|publisher=[[St. Martin's Paperbacks]]|year=1990|isbn=0-312-92350-3|author2=Rich Wiseman}}&lt;/ref&gt; which documented her early years and her relationship with her husband and their children, eight of whom wrote salutes to their mother in the book's foreword.&lt;ref name=family/&gt; She detailed that her husband on more than a few occasions had committed adultery. This prompted Katherine to file for divorce on March 9, 1973, at the [[Los Angeles County]] clerk, but chose to rescind the divorce papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/10/29/jacko-family-secrets-revealed.html|title=Jacko's Family Secrets Revealed|first=Roger|last=Friedman|date=29 October 2004|work=foxnews.com|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Joh'Vonnie Jackson, Joe's daughter with another woman named Cheryl Terrell, was born on August 30, 1974. This led Joe and Cheryl to a 25-year affair while raising their daughter .&lt;ref name=family/&gt; Jackson attempted once again to divorce her husband in or around 1982, but again was persuaded to drop the action. Consequently, Katherine and Joe remained officially married.

In an unauthorized biography of Janet Jackson, a confrontational family incident was described. This biography claims that in 1979, Jackson and her two youngest children, Randy and Janet, confronted a woman who worked for Joseph's company, whom Jackson had often reportedly accused of cheating with Joseph. That incident was redramatized for the 1992 miniseries ''[[The Jacksons: An American Dream]]''. However, in the miniseries, Jackson was shown confronting Joseph instead of the woman about the alleged incident.

In the late 1980s, Jackson began experiencing an estrangement with her daughter [[La Toya Jackson|La Toya]] after she was being managed by [[Jack Gordon (entertainment manager)|Jack Gordon]]. In her 1991 memoirs, ''[[La Toya: Growing Up in the Jackson Family]]'', La Toya alleged that Jackson was emotionally abusive, charges Jackson denied to the press and blamed Gordon, who married La Toya in 1989, for "brainwashing" her. In 1997, La Toya and Jackson reconciled after she filed for divorce from Gordon.

Jackson was portrayed by [[Angela Bassett]] in the 1992 miniseries ''The Jacksons: An American Dream''. [[Patricia Idlette]] portrayed her in the 2004 film ''[[Man in the Mirror: The Michael Jackson Story]]''.

==Recent years==
Jackson has spent the last couple of decades talking to the press defending her children, mainly Michael, who began to gain notoriety. In a recent interview promoting her [https://web.archive.org/web/20110714103040/http://www.mjfanmemorabilia.com/ ''Michael Jackson vip Book''/DVD] on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', however, Jackson acknowledged that she got her husband to admit to [[physical discipline|physically disciplining]] their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Michael Jackson's Kids, Parents Join Oprah: Talk Plastic Surgery, Beatings and...French Toast?|date=8 November 2010|author=Gina Serpe|work=eonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, some claimed that Joe was abusive towards his children, which he has continually denied.

Jackson currently resides with the three children of her son Michael, and with her grandson [[T. J. Jackson (singer)|T. J. Jackson]], along with his family at her [[Calabasas, California]], the home in which she has been living since 2011. Jackson had moved out of her Hayvenhurst home in [[Encino, California]], due to house renovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/michael-jacksons-estate-buys-in-calabasas-for-10-75-million-1403036338|title=Michael Jackson's Estate Buys in Calabasas for $10.75 Million|first=Candace|last=Taylor|date=20 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2016|via=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2011/dirt/real-estalker/kathryn-jackson-takes-her-grandbabies-to-calabasas-1201231331/|title=Kathryn Jackson Takes Her Grandbabies to Calabasas|first=Mark|last=David|date=27 March 2011|work=variety.com|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite rumors that she is estranged from Joe, she has denied it and dismissed rumors that Joe was banned from the Jackson family home as false, and something the media had tried to cook up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXD3ttwi7aE |title=Katherine Jackson Speaks To Geraldo Rivera 8/2/09 |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2009-08-02 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/celebrity.news.gossip/04/26/katherine.jackson.motherhood/|title=Michael Jackson's mom talks about motherhood, family|first=By Alan Duke,|last=CNN|date=|work=cnn.com|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/michael-jackson/5970201/Michael-Jacksons-mother-Katherine-He-didnt-die-of-natural-causes.html|title=Michael Jackson's mother Katherine: 'He didn't die of natural causes'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her son Jermaine Jackson's 2011 book (''You Are Not Alone: Michael Through a Brother's Eyes''), Jackson had told Michael that she was nearing the age of 80 and before she died, she wanted to see her sons perform together one last time. One of Michael Jackson's future plans as part of his deal with AEG Live was a final reunion tour with his brothers. She most recently appeared at the [[BET Awards 2015]] with daughter Janet as she accepted the Ultimate Icon Award.

Katherine's husband Joe Jackson died from [[pancreatic cancer]] on June 27, 2018, two days after the 9th anniversary of Michael Jackson's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2018/06/27/joe-jackson-dead-dies/|title=Joe Jackson Dead at 89|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-jackson-father-of-michael-and-janet-jackson-dead-at-89/|title=Joe Jackson, father of Michael and Janet Jackson, dead at 89|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Michael Jackson==
On June 25, 2009, Michael [[Death of Michael Jackson|died]] from an overdose of [[propofol]] under the supervision of his personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray. Jackson, along with the rest of her family, attended [[Michael Jackson memorial service|his memorial]] on July 7, 2009.

Court documents indicated that Debbie Rowe was also seeking control over Prince and Paris' interests in their father's estate.&lt;ref name=mail/&gt; On July 30, 2009, Katherine Jackson and Debbie Rowe reached a settlement pertaining to the care of Michael's two oldest children (with Rowe), Prince and Paris; in which, the children will be raised by Katherine, and Rowe will have visitation rights and continue to receive the yearly payments to which Michael had agreed.

On August 3, 2009, the judge named Jackson as the children's permanent guardian. On July 25, 2012, Jackson's guardianship of the children was suspended by the court amid allegations that she may have been held against her will by several Jackson family members, as a result of a financial dispute between those family members and the Michael Jackson estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/katherine-jackson-loses-custody-of-mjs-kids-391956.html |title=Katherine Jackson loses custody of MJ’s kids|publisher=Firstpost.com | date= 26 July 2012|accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guardianship of the children was temporarily given to Michael's nephew, TJ, one of Tito's sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/25/showbiz/jackson-family-dispute/index.html?hpt=hp_c1|title=Judge suspends Katherine Jackson as guardian of Michael Jackson's children|publisher=Cnn.com|date=2012-07-25|accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [Katherine Jackson's] guardianship resumed with TJ Jackson added as a co-guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duke|first=Alan|title=Katherine Jackson resumes guardianship of Michael Jackson's children|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/02/showbiz/jackson-custody-decision/index.html|publisher=Cnn.com|accessdate=3 October 2013|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/Celebs/jackson,%20michael_report.pdf |format=PDF |title=Autopsy Report for Michael Jackson |publisher=Autopsyfiles.org|accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 1, 2017, Jackson resigned as co-guardian of Michael's youngest son, Blanket.

'''Louis Marie François Franck''' (28 November 1868 &amp;ndash; 31 December 1937) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] lawyer and [[Liberalism|liberal]] politician.

==Education==

He was born in [[Antwerp]], and began his education at the ''Koninklijk Atheneum'' (E: Royal Atheneum) of Antwerp, where he was influenced by the Flemish writer and liberal politician [[Jan van Beers]], and he obtained a law degree at the [[Free University of Brussels]] (now split into the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]). As a student, he was one of the co-founders of the [[secular humanist]] ''Cercle Universitaire'' (1887), he wrote for the ''Journal des Etudiants'' (1889) and in 1890 he was founder-President of the ''Cercle Universitaire de Criminologie''.

==Career==
In 1890, he set up practice as a lawyer in Antwerp and specialized himself in international marine law. As the president of the ''Conférence du Jeune Barreau'' (E: League of young lawyers) and as a member of the ''Vlaamse Conferentie der Balie'' (E: Flemish bar league), he wanted to promote the use of Dutch in court (which was in French in those days). In 1899, he was one of the co-founders of the ''Bond der Vlaamsche Rechtsgeleerden'' (E: League of Flemish lawyers), of which he became President in 1912.

In 1906, he put himself candidate as a member of the [[Belgian parliament]], of which he would remain a member up to 1926. He strived for a gradual improvement of the usage of the Dutch language in Flanders, such as with the law ''Franck-Paul Segers'' on the usage of Dutch in secondary education in the public schools (1910). Since then he fought on the side of the [[Roman catholic]] [[Frans Van Cauwelaert]] and the [[socialist]] [[Camille Huysmans]] (together they were called the ''three crowing cocks'') for the usage of Dutch at the [[University of Ghent]]. This brought him on the peak of its popularity in Flanders. In 1911, he was sworn in, as the candidate of the Antwerp liberal party, as a member of the municipal Council of Antwerp.

In 1915, he was co-founder and President of the ''Comité voor Hulp en Voeding'' (E: Committee of help and food) of the province of Antwerp and [[alderman]] for the Port of Antwerp. During the German occupation of Belgium in World War I, Franck (under the influence of the Belgian king and the government) acted as the President of a ''Intercommunale Commissie van Notabelen'', the actual head of Antwerp and the neighbouring municipalities. He conducted a careful policy where the language disputes (Dutch versus French) had to rest during the war. He openly condemned the collaboration with the Germans ([[Activism]]), and became the personification of the resistance in Flanders.

Although he, in 1916, had said that the fight for the Flemish rights had to be continued after the war, he himself did not get involved with it anymore. After the war he became [[Minister of the Colonies (Belgium)|Minister of Colonies]] (1918–1924), and on 27 September 1926, he succeeded [[Fernand Hautain]] as governor of the [[National Bank of Belgium]] and together with [[Paul van Zeeland]], he led this institute for many years in a dynamic but autocratic and self-opinioned way. [[Gustave Sap]] attacked the policy of the National Bank in his speech of 16 March 1937 and also the socialist politician [[Henri de Man]] attacked him on his policy in 1937. Louis Franck committed suicide at [[Wijnegem]], while a judicial investigation was being conducted.

The end of his relationship with Shaw inspired Webber to create his film ''[[The End of Love]]'', which starred Webber and his son and premiered at [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Amy|title=Sundance 2012: Mark Webber's unsuspecting castmate|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2012/01/mark-webber-the-end-of-love-sundance.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=December 24, 2013|date=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webber and Shaw share joint custody of their son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohn|first=Beverly|title=Mark Webber Discusses "The End Of Love"|url=http://www.smmirror.com/articles/seven-days/Mark-Webber-Discusses-The-End-Of-Love/37073|work=Santa Monica Mirror|accessdate=December 24, 2013|date=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Young Cheney Greeley''' (1811 or 1814 – 1872) was the wife of American newspaper editor [[Horace Greeley]].

Little is known of her early life. She was briefly a schoolteacher, and later an intermittent suffragette and [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]]. She is reported to have been mentally unstable for much of her life. The date of her birth is uncertain, with some sources stating 1811 and others 1814.&lt;ref name="Mrs obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.litchfieldhistoricalsociety.org/ledger/students/3836 ''Litchfield Ledger'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=DEVJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=Mary+Young+Cheney+Greeley+1811&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4FzbCFqsKZ&amp;sig=3XokKQwe0_v7hau90yHyY-N711k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjh6ejImOzeAhUHGTQIHcCjBfs4ChDoATACegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Mary%20Young%20Cheney%20Greeley%201811&amp;f=false ''Correspondence of Henry D. Thoreau'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=JmRgDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=Mary+Young+Cheney+Greeley+1814&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Em980F_2gp&amp;sig=RUqyj-GYlQ4jZornWyPD5Iohkgs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiWjJnYmOzeAhUzPn0KHbc0BKAQ6AEwD3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Mary%20Young%20Cheney%20Greeley%201814&amp;f=false ''Mark Twain's Letters'']&lt;/ref&gt;

They married in [[Warrenton, North Carolina]], on July 5, 1836. Early in their marriage he used her $5000 in savings to fund his first private newspaper.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The marriage was not a happy one, and her oppressive relationship with her husband colored her life. He had little say in the running of the house, and avoided his wife and their house. However, he kept her almost constantly pregnant, but took no responsibility for the children. Five of their seven children died quite young, at least some of them of neglect.&lt;ref name="woodhull"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FAPg5QVvisoC&amp;pg=PA56 |title=Other Powers: The Age of Suffrage, Spiritualism, and the Scandalous Victoria Woodhull|publisher=Books.google.com |date=1998-04-21 |accessdate=2010-11-18|isbn=9780060953324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;includeonly&gt;Mary &lt;/includeonly&gt;Greeley was an advocate of the [[Graham Diet]] and a [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualist]]. Her behavior suggests she may have had [[clinical depression]] and [[Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder]].&lt;ref name="woodhull"/&gt;  She believed her son Arthur Young Greeley, known as "Pickie",&lt;ref&gt;Hon. S.S. Randall, "[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1872/12/25/page/7/article/personal-recollections-of-mr-greeley Personal Recollections of Mr. Greeley]." New York ''Telegraph'', reprinted in the Chicago ''Tribune'', December 25, 1872, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Mediumship|spirit medium]]. She kept him isolated from the world and from other children, and constantly demanded that he relay communications from the afterlife. As he grew older he began to express a fierce anger towards his mother.&lt;ref name="woodhull"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Olasky, ''[https://www.worldmag.com/world/olasky/centralideas/chap7.html Central Ideas in the Development of American Journalism: A Narrative History]'' (Routledge, 2015), chapter 7. Entire text online at worldmag.com.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death at age five from cholera, she hired the 11-year-old [[Fox sisters|Kate Fox]] to stay at her house and contact him. Ms. Fox later wrote that she too disliked Mrs. Greeley intensely.&lt;ref name="woodhull"/&gt;

She suffered from "[[Tuberculosis|consumptive lung disease]]" for the last 20 years of her life, and died from it on October 30, 1872. Her husband, who was running for [[President of the United States]] at the time, died 30 days later.&lt;ref name="Mrs obituary"&gt;{{cite news|title=OBITUARY.; Mrs. Horace Greeley|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1872/10/31/archives/obituary-mrs-horace-greeley.html|accessdate=21 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 31, 1872|location=New York, NY, US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vietnamese refugees on US carrier, Operation Frequent Wind.jpg|thumb|300px|South Vietnamese refugees arrive on a U.S. Navy vessel during [[Operation Frequent Wind]] in 1975.]]
A '''non-combatant evacuation operation''' ('''NEO''') is an operation conducted to [[Emergency evacuation|evacuate]] [[civilian]]s from another country, generally due to a deteriorating security situation.

==Germany==
*1997 - [[Operation Libelle]] - evacuation of German citizens from [[Albania]]
*2011 - [[Operation Pegasus (2011)]] - evacuation of German citizens from [[Libya]]

==Ireland (Republic of)==
*2011 - evacuation of Irish citizens during the [[2011 Libyan civil war|Libyan civil war]], via [[Malta]]

==United States of America==
According to United States Military Joint Publication 3-68, ''Noncombatant Evacuation Operations'':

::"Noncombatant evacuation operations (NEOs) are conducted to assist the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] (DOS) in evacuating noncombatants, nonessential military personnel, selected host-nation citizens, and third country nationals whose lives are in danger from locations in a host foreign nation to an appropriate safe haven and/or the United States.

::NEOs usually involve swift insertions of a force, temporary occupation of an objective, and a planned withdrawal upon completion of the mission.

::During NEOs, the US [[Ambassador]] is the senior authority for the evacuation and is ultimately responsible for the successful completion of the NEO and the safety of the evacuees. The Ambassador speaks with the authority of the [[President of the United States|President]] and serves as direct representative on site."

This means that at times American citizens may become endangered in locations outside of the United States.  This is usually due to [[civil unrest]] or war.  However, it may also be due to a [[natural disaster]].  The U.S. Ambassador has the responsibility, according to law, to request a NEO.  Once he does, the government will determine whether or not the evacuation should be done with civilian resources, such as the [[Civil Reserve Air Fleet]] (CRAF), or with military forces.  Even if military forces conduct the evacuation, the Ambassador remains in charge of the evacuation.

The method of evacuation could include sealift, [[airlift]], or even by road.

'''Verdi Phefferkorn von Offenbach''' (Bandung 1922), better known as '''‘Paatje Phefferkorn’''', is an iconic [[Indo people|Indo]] (Eurasian) practitioner of the Indonesian martial art Pencak Silat in the Netherlands. As one of its best known teachers he has played an important role in increasing the popularity of this [[Martial Art]] in the Netherlands and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paatjephefferkorn.hyves.nl/ Basic information from the official fan site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Paatje Phefferkorn is also the creator of the informal [[Indo people|Indo]] flag and emblem.

==Dutch East Indies 1931–1941==
In 1931 at the age of 10 Phefferkorn started practicing [[Pencak Silat]] in [[Bandung]], the [[Dutch East Indies]]. He became a prodigy and only [[Indo people|Indo]] student at the Javanese Pencak Silat school of teacher Mr. Sumanto who practiced the style of ‘Setia Hati’. For 7 years he trained with Sumanto on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martialhub.com/articles/phefferkorn.ht Interview (English) with Paatje Phefferkorn]&lt;/ref&gt;

==WWII 1942–1945==
When WWII broke out Phefferkorn enlisted as volunteer and became an air force armaments mechanic and air gunner. The aging Glenn Martin bombers at the secret airport of Samazinda where he was stationed were no match for the modern Japanese war machine and on 8 March 1942 he was made a [[POW]].
He managed to escape the Japanese prisoner camp and fled to the Preanger mountains where he joined other resistance fighters to engage the Japanese in a guerilla war. Despite the fact he was half Indonesian his blue eyes revealed he was not Javanese and he was caught during a razzia by the [[Kempeitai]].
Non of the other resistance fighters survived Japanese imprisonment. Phefferkorn barely survived himself and after Japan's defeat in the war he only weighed 21 kilos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martialhub.com/articles/phefferkorn.ht Interview (English) with Paatje Phefferkorn]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolution 1946–1958==
Due to the revolutionary violence during the [[Bersiap]] period following Japan's capitulation, he was initially unable to leave the prison camp, but was too frustrated with the fact that he had to be protected by Japanese guards that he stole weapons and escaped their protective custody. 
He survived the Bersiap period and vainly attempted to build a home for his family during the chaotic years of the Indonesian Revolution. In one of the last so called repatriation waves he left Indonesia for the Netherlands.

==The Netherlands 1959–2012==
Penniless Phefferkorn arrived in the Netherlands with a family of 7 children and only continued the art of Pencak Silat for his personal training exercises. In 1967 he started a small school in the city of [[Utrecht]]. Soon he established a second school and in the end ran 17 schools throughout the Netherlands. He became part of the "Council Of Elders" advising the Dutch Pencak Silat union, BPSI (Bond Pencak Silat Indonesia). In 2013 he was officially inducted in the CBME's National Dutch Hall of Fame for Martial Artists.&lt;ref&gt;Groot, G.F. de, Drs. Notosoejitno''‘Pencak Silat De Indonesische Zelfverdedigingskunst’'' (George F. de Groot Publishers, Netherlands) {{ISBN|978-90-810380-1-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indo Melati Flag==
Phefferkorn is also known as the creator of the 'Indo Melati' flag and emblem. The flag represents communal pride and loyalty and overal peace and non-violence supported by signs of defensibility.
* The two tilted 'siku-siku' (tridents) and the 'golok' (sword) represent [[Indo people]] as advocates and fighters in words and deeds.
* The middle of the triangle is reserved for the 'kembang melati' (jasmine flower); the flower represents charm and beauty. This flower particularly symbolizes Indo women.
* The star on top symbolizes the brightness during a dark night and people that shine when times call for it. 
* The symbol is enclosed by a 'padi' halm (young rice stalk) on the left and right side. This symbolizes prosperity and good fortune.
* At the bottom the word INDO is written in gold coloured capital letters.&lt;ref&gt;English translation and explanation retrieved from the Dutch-Indonesian Myspace web page: [http://groups.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=groups.groupProfile&amp;groupID=100586245]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pyotr Petrovich Schmidt''' ({{lang-ru|Пётр Петрович Шмидт}}; {{OldStyleDate|February 17|1867|February 5}} &amp;ndash; {{OldStyleDate|March 19|1906|March 6}}) was one of the leaders of the Sevastopol Uprising during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]].

==Early years==
Pyotr Petrovich Schmidt was born in 1867 in [[Odessa]], [[Russian Empire]], now [[Ukraine]], to the family of a naval officer. His father Pyotr Petrovich Schmidt Sr participated in the defense of [[Sevastopol|Sebastopol]] during the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854)]]. His mother Yekaterina Yakovlevna Schmidt (born von Wagner) was of German descent. Schmidt spent his youth in [[Berdyansk]], where his father was appointed mayor. In 1883 Schmidt Jr entered the Naval Officers' Corps in [[Saint Petersburg]] and after graduation enrolled in the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. He resigned in 1888 and married Dominika Gavrilovna Pavlova. After the birth of his son Yevgeniy in 1889, the family moved to [[Taganrog]], where [[Alexander Nentzel]], manager of the Azov-Don Commercial Bank offered him a bookkeeper position. In 1893, Schmidt left Taganrog and enrolled again in the [[Imperial Russian Navy]].

==Uprising in the Black Sea Fleet== &lt;!--- [[Sevastopol Uprising]] redirects here --&gt;
The uprising in the [[Black Sea Fleet]] was part of the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]. Schmidt was a [[lieutenant commander]] of the [[destroyer]] ''Number 253'' in the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. On 1 October 1905, he made a speech during a meeting in [[Sevastopol|Sebastopol]], urging the citizens to stand up for their rights and demanding the authorities free political prisoners. Participants of the meeting headed towards the city prison, where they were met with machine gun fire. In the following days, Pyotr Schmidt gave a speech at the special session of the Sevastopol City Council and at the cemetery during the funeral ceremony, where he was arrested. He was conveyed to the battleship [[Russian battleship Tri Sviatitelia|''Tri Sviatitelia'']], which provoked protests and the authorities were forced to release him. On 7 November 1905, Schmidt was retired with the rank of captain (капитан 2 ранга).

The uprising continued and with the cruiser ''Ochakov'' in its center. On November 26, 1905 a mutiny began the cruiser, and its officers were expelled from the ship. Lieutenant Commander Schmidt, though not being a member of [[RSDRP]], was invited to take command of the rebel ships, including the minelayer ''Griden'', gunboat ''Usuriets'', destroyers ''Zavetniy'', ''Zorkiy'', ''Svirepiy'', ''265'', ''268'', ''270'', training ship ''Dnestr'' and mine carrier ''Bug''. The same day, the Soviets of Sailors' and Soldiers' Deputies decided to start a Black Sea Fleet-wide mutiny and appoint Schmidt as Commander of the Fleet. On November 28, Pyotr Schmidt arrived on board the cruiser ''Ochakov'', which raised the red flag and the signal ''Commanding the Fleet''. The rebel squadron was also joined by the battleship [[Russian battleship Panteleimon|''Panteleimon'']]. The revolutionary forces made up some 8,200 vs. 10,000 government forces. Schmidt sent a telegram to Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The glorious Black Sea Fleet, sacredly devoted to the people, demands Your Majesty to immediately call a meeting of the Constituent Assembly (Учредительное собрание), and no longer obeys orders of Your ministers. Commander of the Fleet P. Schmidt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The commander of the Imperial Russian forces, General Meller-Zakomelskiy, gave an ultimatum demanding immediate capitulation, but there was no reply. Three hours after the ultimatum, the government forces opened fire at rebel ships and barracks. In 90 minutes, the revolutionary squadron was defeated by the government ships led by the battleship [[Russian battleship Rostislav|''Rostislav'']]. Schmidt and his 16-year-old son were captured, and all who remained alive were arrested. Next day, the government forces supported by artillery took the rebellion barracks.

==Aftermath==
A closed hearing was held in February 1906 in a small fortress in the island of Tendra near [[Sevastopol|Sebastopol]]. Schmidt and other leaders of the uprising were sentenced to death. He was executed on 19 March 1906 at [[Berezan Island]] by the crew of the gunboat ''Terets''.  In 1922, [[Mikhail Stavraki]], commander of the gunboat's [[firing squad]] was discovered in [[Batumi]] in possession of five fake passports in different names and old bank notes, by [[Cheka]] agents. The trial of Stavraki, who was Schmidt's classmate at the Naval Corps in St Petersburg, was held on 1 April 1923 in Sebastopol, while most of the witnesses and participants of the events were still alive. On 3 April 1923 the Military Board of the Supreme Court of the USSR sentenced Stavraki to death by firing squad.

==Places named after Pyotr Schmidt==

* There are two operas based on his life: the first was written in 1938 (composer NI Platonov), the second in 1970 (composer BL Yarovinsky, staged in 1970 by VM Sklyarenko at the Kharkov Opera House).&lt;ref&gt;Музыкальная энциклопедия. Гл. ред. Ю. В. Келдыш. Т 6. Хейнце — Яшугин. 1008 стб. илл. М.: Советская энциклопедия, 1982 (стб. 1002)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1969 film ‘Postal novel’ depicts his complex relationship with Zinaida Riesberg, on the basis of their correspondance. He is played by Alexander Parra.
* In the classic film “[[We'll Live Till Monday|We’ll Live Till Monday]]”, there is a long discussion about him in one of the final scenes, where one of the students claims that Schmidt’s sacrifice was foolish, only to have the teacher (played by [[Vyacheslav Tikhonov]]) counter that it is easy to say things like this with historical hindsight. He then launches into a detailed portrait of Schmidt’s accomplishments, and urges the children to read his correspondence with Zinaida Riesberg.

In [[music]], a '''quartet''' or '''quartette'''&lt;ref name=RHD&gt;{{cite web|last=Random House Dictionary|title=Quartet|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/quartet|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MWI&gt;{{cite web|last=Merriam-Webster|title=Quartet|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quartet|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc., div. of Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Lang-fr|quatuor}}, {{Lang-de|Quartett}}, {{Lang-it|quartetto}}, {{Lang-es|cuarteto}}, {{Lang-pl|kwartet}}) is an ensemble of four singers or instrumental performers; or a musical composition for four voices or instruments.&lt;ref name=RHD /&gt;&lt;ref name=MWI /&gt;

==Classical==
===String quartet===
{{Main|String quartet}}
[[Image:String quartet.JPG|right|thumb|A string quartet in performance. From left to right - violin 1, violin 2, cello, viola]]

In Classical music, the most important combination of four instruments in [[chamber music]] is the string quartet.&lt;ref name=HDM-Q&gt;{{cite journal|last=Apel|first=Willi|title=Quartet|journal=Harvard Dictionary of Music|year=1975|volume=Second|isbn=0-674-37501-7|pages=711}}&lt;/ref&gt; String quartets most often consist of two [[violin]]s, a [[viola]], and a [[cello]]. The particular choice and number of instruments derives from the registers of the human voice: [[soprano]], [[alto (voice)|alto]], [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]]. In the string quartet, two violins play the soprano and alto vocal registers, the viola plays the tenor register and the cello plays the bass register.

Composers of notable string quartets include [[Joseph Haydn]] (68 compositions), [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (23), [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (17), [[Felix Mendelssohn]] (6), [[Franz Schubert]] (15), [[Johannes Brahms]] (3), [[Antonín Dvořák]] (14), [[Alexander Borodin]] (2), [[Béla Bartók]] (6), and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] (15).&lt;ref name=HDM-Q /&gt; The Italian composer [[Luigi Boccherini]] (1743–1805), wrote more than 100 string quartets.

Less often, string quartets are written for other combinations of the standard string ensemble. These include quartets for one violin, two violas, and one cello, notably by [[Carl Stamitz]] (6 compositions) and others; and for one violin, one viola, and two cellos, by [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger]] and others.

===Piano quartet===
{{Main|Piano quartet}}
Another common standard classical quartet is the '''[[piano quartet]]''', consisting of violin, viola, cello, and [[piano]]. [[Romantic composer]]s Beethoven, Brahms, and Mendelssohn each wrote three important compositions in this form, and Mozart, Dvořák, and [[Gabriel Fauré]] each wrote two.&lt;ref name=HDM-Q /&gt;

===Other instrumental quartets===
'''Wind quartets''' are scored either the same as a string quartet with the wind instrument replacing the first violin (i.e. scored for wind, violin, viola and cello) or are groups of four wind instruments. Among the latter, the SATB format [[woodwind quartet]] of flute, oboe, clarinet, and bassoon is relatively common.

An example of a [[wind quartet]] featuring four of the same types of wind instruments is the [[saxophone quartet]], consisting of [[soprano saxophone]], [[alto saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]] and [[baritone saxophone]] or (SATB). Often a second alto may be substituted for the soprano part (AATB) or a [[bass saxophone]] may be substituted for the baritone{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}.

===Vocal quartet&lt;!--[[vocal quartet]] redirects directly here.--&gt;===
Compositions for four singers have been written for quartets [[a cappella]]; accompanied by instruments, such as a piano; and accompanied by larger vocal forces, such as a choir. Brahms and Schubert wrote numerous pieces for four voices that were once popular in private salons, although they are seldom performed today. Vocal quartets also feature within larger classical compositions, such as [[opera]], choral works, and symphonic compositions. The final movement of [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] and the [[Verdi Requiem]] are two examples of renowned concert works that include vocal quartets.

Typically, a vocal quartet is composed of:
* [[Soprano]], [[alto]] (or [[mezzo-soprano]]), [[tenor]], and [[bass (voice type)|bass]] (or [[baritone]]), for mixed ensembles; or
* 1st tenor, 2nd tenor, baritone, and bass, for male groups; or
* 1st soprano, 2nd soprano, mezzo-soprano, and [[contralto]], for female groups; or
* Tenor, lead, baritone, and bass, for [[Barbershop music|barbershop style]] (both male and female).

===Baroque quartet===
The [[baroque music|baroque]] quartet is a form of music composition similar to the [[trio sonata]], but with four [[part (music)|music parts]] performed by three solo melodic instruments and [[basso continuo]]. The solo instruments could be strings or [[wind instruments]].

Examples of baroque quartets are [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann's]] [[Paris quartets]].

==Jazz==
Quartets are popular in [[jazz]] and [[jazz fusion]] music. Jazz quartet ensembles are often composed of a horn, classically clarinet (or [[saxophone]], [[trumpet]], etc.), a chordal instrument (e.g., [[electric guitar]], [[piano]], [[Hammond organ]], etc.), a [[double bass|bass instrument]] (e.g., [[double bass]], [[tuba]] or [[bass guitar]]) and a [[drum kit]]. This configuration is sometimes modified by using a second horn replacing the chordal instrument, such as a trumpet and saxophone with string bass and drum kit, or by using two chordal instruments (e.g., [[piano]] and [[electric guitar]]).

==Popular music==
{{See also|Four-piece}}
In 20th century Western [[popular music]], the term "vocal quartet" usually refers to ensembles of four singers of the same gender. This is particularly common for [[barbershop quartets]] and [[Gospel quartet]]s.

Some well-known female US vocal quartets include [[The Carter Sisters]]; [[The Forester Sisters]]; [[The Chiffons]]; [[The Chordettes]]; [[The Lennon Sisters]]; and [[En Vogue]]. Some well-known male US vocal quartets include [[The Oak Ridge Boys]]; [[The Statler Brothers]]; [[The Ames Brothers]]; [[The Chi-Lites]]; [[Crosby Stills Nash &amp; Young]]; [[The Dixie Hummingbirds]]; [[The Four Aces]]; [[Four Freshmen]]; [[The Four Seasons (group)|The Four Seasons]]; [[The Four Tops]]; The Cathedral Quartet; Ernie Haase and Signature Sound; [[The Golden Gate Quartet]]; [[The Hilltoppers (band)|The Hilltoppers]]; [[The Jordanaires]]; and [[Mills Brothers]]. The only known U.S. drag quartet is [[The Kinsey Sicks]]. Some mixed-gender vocal quartets include [[The Pied Pipers]]; [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]]; [[The Merry Macs]]; and [[The Weavers]].

The quartet lineup also is very common in pop and [[rock music]]. A standard quartet formation in pop and rock music is an ensemble consisting of two [[electric guitar]]s, a [[bass guitar]], and a [[drum kit]]. This configuration is sometimes modified by using a keyboard instrument (e.g., [[Organ (music)|organ]], [[piano]], [[synthesizer]]) or a soloing instrument (e.g., [[saxophone]]) in place of the second [[electric guitar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2000469/Million-Dollar-Quartet-A-toe-tapping-night-music-perfect-Fathers-Da.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|author=dailymail|title=Million Dollar Quartet: A toe-tapping night of music perfect for Father's Day|date=9 June 2011|location=London|work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk music==

===Russian===
A Russian folk-instrument quartet commonly consists of a [[Bayan (accordion)|bayan]], a prima [[balalaika]], a prima or alto [[domra]], and a contrabass balalaika. Configurations without a bayan include a prima domra, a prima balalaika, an alto domra, and a bass balalaika; or two prima domras, a prima balalaika, and a bass balalaika.

{{quote|One time I was climbing with Robbi, and I was feeling so cold as we approached the summit in the rain. Robbi gave me his gloves and his jacket to wear, leaving him just in a t-shirt.

The '''Blessed Stephana de Quinzanis''', [[Third Order of St. Dominic|T.O.S.D.]], (variant spellings include '''Stephanie''', '''Stefana'''; also, '''Quinzani''') (1457 – 2 January 1530) was an Italian [[Third Order of St. Dominic|Dominican Sister]], [[stigmatic]] and [[Christian mysticism|mystic]].

==Life==
She was born in 1457 in [[Brescia]], Italy, to Lorenzo de Quinzanis and his wife, who were a poor and pious couple.&lt;ref name="penitent"&gt;{{cite book | last =Bornstein | first =Daniel|author2=Ann Matter |author3=Maiju Lehmijoki-Gardner  | title =Dominican Penitent Women | publisher =Paulist Press | year =2005 | pages =251 | url =https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0809139790&amp;id=Ip-RGPX_TVMC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;ots=fw0VjxrBiv&amp;dq=quinzani&amp;sig=EK2ubb2-NkQcp5U8sIhUA5mak20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father became a member of the [[Third Order of St. Dominic]] while Stephana was very young. While accompanying him on visits to the Dominican monastery in nearby [[Soncino, Lombardy|Soncino]], she met the [[stigmata|stigmatic]] [[friar]], the [[Matthew Carrieri|Blessed Matthew Carrieri]], [[Dominican Order|O.P.]], who instructed her in the [[catechism]]. Carrieri told her that she would be his spiritual heiress, a statement she did not understand for many years.&lt;ref name="patrick"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabenstein |first=Katherine |title=Blessed Stephana de Quinzanis, OP |work=Saints O' the Day for January 2 |date=March 1999 |url=http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0102.htm |accessdate=26 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401230704/http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0102.htm |archivedate=1 April 2007 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt; She began receiving visions of Dominican saints from age seven, at which point she made vows of [[Evangelical counsels|poverty, chastity and obedience]].&lt;ref name="patrick"/&gt; In a subsequent miraculous experience in 1464, Christ appeared to her, accompanied by Mary and Dominican Saints St. Dominic, St. Thomas Aquinas, and St. Catherine of Siena, presenting her with a wedding ring, signifying her [[mystical marriage]]. Carrieri died when Stephana was 14 years old; soon after he appeared to her in a vision, and she herself received the stigmata.&lt;ref name="patrick"/&gt;

De Quinzanis started to work as a servant for her living, but she continued in her formation in the Third Order, and at age 15 made her [[profession]] at the Dominican priory in Soncino. Her devotion to the poor and sick led her to found a community of [[Third Order]] Sisters there. She served as its first [[prioress]].

Her counsel was sought by many, including Saint [[Angela Merici]], foundress of the [[Ursulines]], also the Blessed [[Augustine Fangi]], O.P., as well as her fellow Dominican tertiary and mystic, the Blessed [[Osanna of Mantua]].&lt;ref name="patron"&gt;{{cite web | last = Jones | first = Terry | title = Stephana de Quinzanis| work = Saints.SQPN.com | url=http://saints.sqpn.com/blessed-stephana-de-quinzanis/ | accessdate = 26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in various stages of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Jesus Christ]], which was attested to by 21 witnesses in 1497 in a still extant account, written in the vernacular, and entitled ''Relazione dell'Estasi della Passione''.&lt;ref name="patrick"/&gt; Sources state that although Stephana was "ugly", she had magnificent hair. Grudging herself this one beauty, she pulled it out by the roots.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite book | last =Dunbar| first =Agnes | title =A Dictionary of Saintly Women | publisher =Bell | year =1905 | pages =232 | url =https://books.google.com/books?vid=0-K-jH9PficyfRtqGip3z7&amp;id=rnr_YADaQn4C&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=quinzani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stephanaquinzanis.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Blessed Stephana depicted on a [[holy card]]]]
De Quinzanis had a particularly intense devotion to [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]]. In fact, to overcome the temptation of [[lust|thoughts against purity]], she once threw herself upon a cartload of thorns in imitation of the ''Doctor Angelicus''. Exhausted from this [[penance]], she prayed to Saint Thomas, and, according to legend, was girded by angels with a cord, which they tied so tightly around her waist that she cried out in pain.&lt;ref name="patrick"/&gt;

Though she had no formal [[theology|theological]] training, she could discuss [[mystical theology]] at the most profound level. She is considered a [[patron saint]] for theologians. It is said that she could read the hearts and minds of the people around her, and had the gift of [[prophesy]] and [[healing]]. She lived in a nearly continuous [[fasting|fast]]. She accurately predicted the date of her own death, which occurred from natural causes on 2 January 1530.&lt;ref name="patron"/&gt;

==Veneration==
De Quinzanis' tomb became a [[pilgrimage]] site almost immediately. Her intercession was often felt in the convent that she had founded, where the [[Religious sisters|sisters]] obtained both material and spiritual help through her intercession.

Her cult was popularized by the Dominicans Bartholomeo of Mantua and Battista of Salò, but their [[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[Biography|vitae]]'' have been lost, and only a later Italian version which combined the two texts has survived.&lt;ref name="penitent"/&gt; Her [[cult (religious practice)|''cultus'']] was confirmed by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] on 14 December 1740.&lt;ref name="patron"/&gt;

'''Steven Quincy Urkel''' is a fictional character on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Family Matters]]'' who was portrayed by [[Jaleel White]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Steve Urkel Is a Hit Notes - Did He Do That? - Review|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=1997-02-05|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE0DF163CF936A35751C0A961958260|accessdate=2009-01-23 | first=Bill | last=Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally slated to have been a one-time only character on the show, he soon broke out to be its [[List of breakout characters|most popular character]] and gradually became its [[protagonist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Snookums!

The character is the [[epitome]] of a [[geek]] or [[nerd]] of the era, due to traits such as large, thick [[eyeglasses]], [[Three quarter pants|flood pants]] held up by [[suspenders]], multi-colored [[cardigan sweater]]s, and a [[falsetto|high-pitched voice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Revenge of The Nerd|work= Time|date=1996-12-09|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985673,00.html|accessdate=2010-08-21 | first=Ginia | last=Bellafante}}&lt;/ref&gt; He professes love for his neighbor Laura Winslow, who is a character in the main family of the series, but this love of his is written as a accent on or trigger for events and crises, and is therefore very unrequited. 

For the Urkel character's debut through the rest of the series' run, he is central to many of its [[running gags]], primarily [[property damage]] and/or [[personal injury]] as a result of his inventions going awry or his outright clumsiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Television: Yes, Urkel Still Lives |work= Time|date=1991-04-01|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972641,00.html|accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He becomes known by viewers and characters alike for several [[catchphrase]]s uttered after some [[humorous]] misfortune occurs, including "[[I've fallen and I can't get up!]]", "Did I do that?" "Whoa, Mama!" and "Look what you did!" (on occasions when someone else caused the damage, though usually the accident was indirectly caused by Urkel). 

== Character development ==
In syndication, Steve Urkel first appeared on the 4th episode of the first season, "Rachel's First Date" (as the show staff wanted to more naturally introduce him to audiences upon repeated viewings). On the 12th episode of the first season, "[[Laura's First Date]]", he reappears as a nerdy young boy who takes [[List of Family Matters characters#Laura Lee Winslow|Laura Winslow]] out on a date. While he is madly in love with her, Laura finds Steve grating and doesn't return his affection.  While intended as a minor character, Urkel became very popular for his oddball antics. He soon became a recurring character, and joined the main cast beginning with the season two premiere "Rachel's Place".{{r|pool19920204}}

''Family Matters'' co-creator Michael Warren named the character after his friend, writer and director Steve Erkel. Due to the show and the character's tremendous popularity during the early 1990s, Erkel encountered difficulties using his own name; he received many [[prank phone call]]s from "Laura" asking for "Steve", and businesses found his name to be suspicious. Warren stated that had he known that the character would reappear for years he would not have named him after his friend.&lt;ref name="pool19920204"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-04/entertainment/ca-1196_1_family-matters | title=Will the Real Steve Please Stand Up? | work=Los Angeles Times | date=1992-02-04 | accessdate=May 26, 2012 | author=Pool, Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portrayal ===
An archetypal nerd, Steve Urkel is characterized as kind and well-meaning, but bungling and a meddler. He is fiercely protective of and obsessed with his unrequited love Laura Winslow, and this admiration extends to the rest of the Winslow family. However, Steve is comically clumsy and inept and his attempts to help the Winslows usually go awry. This puts him at odds with the family patriarch [[List of Family Matters characters#Carlton Otis Winslow|Carl]], who routinely throws Urkel out of his house.

Later episodes suggest that Steve's attachment to the Winslows stems from his bad relationship with his own family. Urkel often hints that most of his relatives, including his (unseen) parents, despise him and refuse to associate with him. This culminates in the two moving to [[Russia]] without him, whereupon he moves in with the Winslows.

Urkel dresses unfashionably for someone his age (he is most commonly seen wearing suspenders, brightly colored shirts, and high water pants)  and has a number of eccentric hobbies and interests, including [[Polka]] dancing and [[accordion]] playing. Unlike his friends, he has little interest in [[popular culture]] and athletic endeavors.

While he is unpopular with his schoolmates, Urkel is a brilliant student and is on a first-name basis with his teachers. He is a genius inventor as well, and his fantastical but unreliable gadgets (including a transformation device and a [[Time travel|time machine]]) are central to many ''Family Matters'' plots and gags.

=== Stefan Urquelle ===
[[File:Stefan Urquelle.jpg|thumb|200px|left|White as Steve's suave alter-ego Stefan Urquelle.]]
During the [[List of Family Matters episodes#Season 5: 1993–1994|season five]] episode "Dr. Urkel and Mr. Cool," in a takeoff on [[The Nutty Professor]] films, Urkel devises a plan to win Laura's heart: transforming his [[DNA]] using a serum, which suppresses his "nerd [[gene]]s" and brings out his "cool" genes. This results in the [[alter ego]] known as '''Stefan Urquelle''', played by Jaleel White in more casual attire. Initially, Laura is enamored with the smoother Stefan, but asks that he turn back into Steve when Stefan's self-centeredness makes itself apparent.

Steve improves the formula in the season five episode "Stefan Returns" to reduce its negative effects on his personality, and invents a "transformation chamber" allowing him to become Stefan at will. He would change into Stefan several times – even while dating Myra – but some circumstance would force Steve to turn into his normal self again. With his narcissistic tendencies toned down, Laura falls deeply in love with Steve's alter-ego.

In the seventh-season finale "Send in the Clones," Steve creates a cloning machine and winds up creating a perfect duplicate of himself. Myra is initially excited, but eventually realizes that two Steves are just too much. To clear up the situation, Laura proposes that one of the Steves be permanently turned into Stefan, so that she and Myra can both be with the one they love. This Stefan becomes a recurring character and eventually proposes to Laura in the ninth season. After weighing her choices in the flashback episode "Pop Goes the Question," Laura chooses Steve over Stefan. Stefan departs and is not seen again.

=== Relationships ===
Steve had been in love with Laura since they were in kindergarten. However, she did not always reciprocate the feelings that he had for her and would date other guys more to her taste. Unlike Greta's successful warding off of Myrtle, Laura's would-be boyfriends would often bully Steve, but it always ends with him warding them off, especially when he knows most of them would end up hurting her in the end and refused to allow them to take advantage of her. Steve has shown that, unlike Myrtle, he does respect Laura's personal space. However, she has shown appreciation for Steve when he selflessly risked himself to not only protect her, but also has saved her father's life. In the ninth-season episode "Out With the Old," he finally gets himself a makeover in time for Laura's charity bachelor auction, and, though it was not a success, her feelings for him finally changed, and they eventually become engaged to be married by "Pop Goes the Question" later that season.

Steve had a short and brief relationship with Susie in season two, but their relationship ended when he introduced her to the president of the chess club. In the season three episode "The Love God," Vonda Mahoney also became interested in him after he tutored her for a class. Fearing that she wants to make herself "easy" for Eddie to date, Steve teaches her the dangers of it and helps her have love and self-respect for herself. Although Vonda felt better about herself, this did not sit well with Eddie, who wanted to pound Steve for it.

In season four's "A Thought In The Dark", Steve was set up with Ted's cousin, Myra Monkhouse (played by Michelle Thomas) so Laura could have some space from his infatuation. Although he was initially attracted to Myra because of her intelligence and sweet personality, he was soon disgusted by her jealous and possessive nature by the end of "Buds 'N Buns". This was explored in both seasons five and nine, when Steve finally saw what life was like in not only Laura's shoes, but in sense the Winslows as well. Though in love with him, Myra was also frustrated with Steve and asked him why he even loves Laura. When he agrees to go steady with her in season six's "Paradise Bluff", she did somewhat revert to the sweet, intelligent girl he was originally attracted to. By season nine, he grows apart from her as he matures and Laura started to return the feelings he had for her. In "Breaking Up Is Hard To Do," during their date at the restaurant Amour, it became clear to Steve that Myra hated his makeover and demanded that he return to the sexy nerd she loved so much. When he refused, she broke up with him first, although it later turned out to be a ploy so she could get him to renounce his love for Laura and stay with her. When that failed, Myra resorted to stalking and spying on him with illegal surveillance gear in her room with a spy cam attached to his glasses. In "Crazy For You," she teamed up with Stefan to stop Steve and Laura's date. Although initially successful, Laura still wanted to date him and Myra vowed never to stop stalking him until he took her back. In the following episode "Crazier For You," Steve has learned that Myra was spying on him and confronted her about it. He orders her to stop stalking him and renounce her love for him because he will never take her back and reaffirms his love for Laura. She refused and got Laura falsely arrested for stealing her watch. However, Steve was able to drop the charges when he exposed Myra for stalking him with illegal spy gear and the police pursued criminal charges against her. When she learned of his engagement to Laura, she continued to carry the torch even when he went into space. However, when she tried to pretend to be Urkel's fiancée, she is caught by an unseen Stefan.

==Cultural impact==
In 2010, Westside Middle School in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]] outlined its [[dress code]] policy on [[Sagging (fashion)|sagging]] pants, asking students to pull them up or get "Urkeled", a reference to the character. In this practice, teachers would forcibly pull students' pants up and attach them to their waist using [[zip tie]]s. Students would also have their photo taken and posted on a board in the hallway, for all of their classmates to view. In an interview with [[NBC]] affiliate [[WMC-TV]], Principal Bobby White stated that the general idea is to fight [[popular culture|pop culture]] with pop culture.&lt;ref name="Bruce_Becky"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bruce|first=Becky|title=Threat of 'Urkel' solves sagging pants problem|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=13561731|accessdate=December 8, 2010|publisher=[[KSL (radio)|KSL.com]] |date=December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One teacher at the school claimed to have "Urkeled" up to 80 students per week, although after five weeks the number dropped to 18.&lt;ref name="ABC2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Students get 'Urkeled' for baggy pants |url=http://www.abc2news.com/dpp/news/national/students-get-%27urkeled%27-for-baggy-pants |accessdate=July 20, 2014 |publisher=[http://www.abc2news.com/ ABC2] |date=December 7, 2010 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210163929/http://www.abc2news.com/dpp/news/national/students-get-%27urkeled%27-for-baggy-pants |archivedate=December 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ratings effect ===
In syndication, Steve is incorporated into the teaser scene of "Rachel's First Date"; his first appearance in the original broadcasts is in the 1989 episode "[[Laura's First Date]]", in which Carl and Eddie separately set up dates for Laura for a dance or party (both terms are used in the episode), and the first thing known about him is that he allegedly ate a [[mouse]], and he later makes reference to a mouse when speaking to Carl, implying that it might be true. Prior to Steve Urkel's introduction, the show was on the brink of cancellation due to mediocre ratings. After Urkel was introduced, several scripts had to be hastily rewritten to accommodate the character, while several first-season episodes that had been completed had new opening gag sequences filmed featuring Steve trying to push open the Winslows' front door while the family holds it shut. The addition of Steve immediately helped the show boost its modest ratings. White was credited as a guest star in the first season and became a regular member of the cast in season two.

=== The Urkel Dance ===
'''''The Urkel Dance''''' was a [[novelty dance]] that originated in the season two episode "Life of the Party". It was based around the character of Steve Urkel and essentially incorporated movements which made the dancer's posture more like his. The lyrics instructed the dancer how to pose:

"If you want to do the Steve Urkel dance,&lt;br /&gt;
All you have to do is hitch up your pants,&lt;br /&gt;
Bend your knees, and stick out your pelvis;&lt;br /&gt;
(I'm telling you, baby, it's better than Elvis!)".

The dance was popular enough to appear on another show, ''[[Step by Step (TV series)|Step by Step]]'', when the Steve Urkel character appeared in a crossover in the season one episode "The Dance".

Jaleel White also performed the song, in character as Steve Urkel, on the 5th Annual [[American Comedy Awards]]. [[Bea Arthur]] (from ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' &amp; ''[[The Golden Girls]]'') joined him on stage to "Do The Urkel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dotheurkel.com Do The Urkel(.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015225146/http://dotheurkel.com/ |date=2010-10-15 }} - The Website&lt;/ref&gt;" after which she said, "Hey [[MC Hammer]], try and [[U Can't Touch This|touch that]]!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houseofdiabolique.com/hall/bea/bea.htm The House of Diabolique vs. Bea Arthur &amp; Urkel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A promotional [[cassette single]] of the song that accompanies the dance was pressed and distributed in limited numbers. A T-shirt was also produced featuring lyrics and Urkel's likeness.

Rick Sanchez pays some form of homage to The Urkel Dance with "The Rick Dance" in the [[Rick and Morty]] episode Ricksy Business.

=== Appearances on other shows ===
* ''[[Full House]]'' – In the 1991 episode, "Stephanie Gets Framed", Steve is called in to help [[Stephanie Tanner]] ([[Jodie Sweetin]]) deal with her anxieties after she has to get glasses. He was cousin to a friend of [[D. J. Tanner|D. J.]]. He also jams with Uncle Jesse and gives Michelle a penny for her piggy bank, telling her that "with prevailing interest rates, that penny will be worth three cents by the turn of the century". Incidentally, ''Family Matters'' did not air on the night of the episode's original airdate (January 25, 1991). It is implied that he found himself in [[San Francisco]] in the ''Full House'' universe before paying a visit to the Lambert household from ''Step by Step''.
* ''[[Step by Step (TV series)|Step by Step]]'' – In the series' second episode, "The Dance", Steve lands in the Lambert-Foster family's backyard after launching himself with a rocket pack from the living room of the Winslows' house in the ''Family Matters'' episode "Brain Over Brawn" (the two scenes being shown in uninterrupted sequence, as ''Family Matters'' and ''Step by Step'' aired back to back on ABC's [[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]] lineup at the time). He then helps his science-fair pen pal, Mark Foster ([[Christopher Castile]]), and lifts Alicia "Al" Lambert ([[Christine Lakin]])'s spirits after her potential date dumps her just before a school dance. White reprises his "Do the Urkel" dance in the scene where Al gives the boy that dumped her his comeuppance. White also makes a brief two-second cameo as Steve in the 1997 episode "A Star Is Born", snapping a [[clapperboard]] on the set of the movie that Al was cast in over her two sisters.
* Additionally, in the ''Family Matters'' episode "Beauty and the Beast," Steve sends a [[chain letter]] to his friend [[List of Boy Meets World characters|Cory Matthews]], who lived in [[Philadelphia]]. The reference is to [[Ben Savage]]'s character from ''[[Boy Meets World]],'' but there were no on-screen crossovers. In an episode of ''Boy Meets World'', Cory says he receives a chain letter from his friend Steve.
* ''[[Fuller House (TV series)|Fuller House]]'' - In the Season 3 finale, Urkel was mentioned by D.J.. In an interview with TVLine’s Andy Swift, series creator [[Jeff Franklin]] mentioned he is friends with White and they have talked about White reprising the role and that they had some ideas for the character if White decides to reprise the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swift|first1=Andy|title=Fuller House Boss Explains Steve Urkel Shout-Out: 'We Have Some Fun Ideas'|url=http://tvline.com/2017/12/22/fuller-house-steve-urkel-mention-explained-season-4-spoilers/|website=TVLine|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?]]'' - Urkel is confirmed to be a guest star on the animated Scooby-Doo series, with White reprising his role &lt;ref name=animationmagazine2&gt;{{cite news |date=2018-05-23 |title=Boomerang Unveils New SCOOBY-DOO AND GUESS WHO? &amp; YABBA-DABBA DINOSAURS!

=== Merchandise ===
At the height of his popularity, Urkel's name was branded to several products including a short-lived fruit flavored cereal known as Urkel-Os and a Steve Urkel pullstring doll. There was also a T-shirt line that was created in 2002, but was discontinued shortly after its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20131627,00.html|title=Family Matters: 1989-1998 |date=2000-06-26|publisher=''People''|accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In 1999, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked Urkel #27 on its list of the "50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TV Guide Guide to TV|year=2004|publisher=Barnes and noble|isbn=0-7607-5634-1|pages=651}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he was listed at #98 in [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''100 Greatest TV Characters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Greatest_TV_Characters//index.shtml|title=Bravo &gt; 100 Greatest TV Characters|publisher=Bravo|accessdate=November 11, 2006|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QOBa5i9z?url=http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Greatest_TV_Characters//index.shtml|archivedate=July 17, 2007|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selected Works ==
'''Poetry'''

'''Yin Chang''' or '''Yin-ch'ang''' ([[traditional Chinese]]: '''{{lang|zh-tw|廕昌}}'''; [[simplified Chinese]]: '''{{lang|zh|荫昌}}'''; [[pinyin]]: Yìnchāng) (1859&lt;ref&gt;According to Xu(main ed.) (2007), p.2209. ''Who's Who in China 3rd ed.'' (1925), p.938. wrote "1860".&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;ndash;1928) was a military official and politician in the [[Qing Dynasty]] and the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. He was appointed the nation's first Minister of War in the late Qing Dynasty. Later he also became the military Chief of Staff in the Beiyang Government. He was [[Manchu people|ethnic Manchu]], and his family belonged to the [[Plain White Banner]] Clan of the [[Manchu Military Organization]] ({{lang|zh-tw|滿洲正白旗}}); he held the title of Prince of that clan; at court he was addressed as Wu-lou.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Hammell, ed. Eminent Chinese of the Ch'ing Period. 2 vols.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== In the Qing Dynasty ===
Originally Yin Chang was a student of [[Guozijian]], and by 1872 he was studying German at the [[Tongwen Guan]], [[Beijing]]. In 1877 he was sent to Germany as an attaché to the Chinese Legation in [[Berlin]]. During his stay in Germany he studied military science at the same time as Wilhelm II and formed an association with the [[Krupp]] family. (He later married a German woman, with whom he had a daughter.) In 1884 he returned to China and was appointed to the Tientsin Naval Academy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yin Chang Minister to Germany|publisher=New York Times|date=August 14, 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;; by December of that year he served as translator for the German military envoy to the Emperor.&lt;ref name=Xu&gt;Xu (main ed.) (2007), p.2209.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=who&gt;''Who's Who in China 3rd ed.'' (1925), p.938.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gai&gt;Gaimusyô Zyôhôbu (1928), p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1885 Yin Chang was appointed an instructor in military science at the Tientsin Military Academy 天津武備學堂, introducing the study of German military techniques taught by German officers. The following year he was promoted to be superintendent of the academy. The President of the Republic of China [[Feng Guozhang]] was a student under his direction. In 1898, when Prince [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1862–1929)|Heinrich]] of Prussia and his naval squadron came to China, Yin Chang negotiated German claims on the region of Kiaochow and the port of Tsingtao and had Prince Heinrich presented at court. In winter 1899, he headed the negotiations with Germany for railway and mining rights in [[Shandong]] ({{lang|zh-tw|山東路礦章程}}) and the concession in Tsingtao. These negotiations became part of the Boxer Protocol, which was signed September 7, 1901, in Beijing &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Treaties and Agreements with and Concerning China, 1894-1919|date=1921|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|edition=Vol. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These terms were later integrated into the Tientsin Protocol, which in 1918 became part of the peace treaty with Germany that ended World War I.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Congress Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 66th Congress. “Treaty of Versailles, Part 1,” p. 1090. U.S. Govt. Printing Office, 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1901 Yin Chang was named Lieutenant-General commanding the Plain White Banner Garrison ({{lang|zh-tw|正白旗漢軍副都統}}).&lt;ref name=Xu/&gt;&lt;ref name=who/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gai/&gt;

It is said that during the [[Boxer Rebellion]], when the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] stormed Beijing to relieve the besieged Legations, Yin Chang, with his German-equipped soldiers, escorted the Emperor and the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] to safe passage through the back gates of the [[Forbidden City]] into [[Shaanxi Province]], where the foreigners could not reach her. In August 1901 he was appointed the Chinese Ambassador to Germany (Berlin) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yin Chang Minister to Germany|publisher=London Times|date=August 14, 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In September 1901, by Imperial Edict &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rockhill|first1=William W.|title=Report: Boxer Protocol, Annex No. 2, 57th Congress, 1st Session|date=1901|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Yin Chang accompanied [[Zaifeng, Prince Chun]] to Germany with the special mission to convey China's regret to Kaiser Wilhelm II for the murder of Baron [[Clemens von Ketteler]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. The mission proved a success, and Prince Chun was eagerly greeted by crowds&lt;ref&gt;''London Times,'' "The Sketch: A Journal of the Arts," Sept. 4, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaiser accorded Prince Chun a splendid reception, which included inviting him to review the military maneuvers of 50,000 troops in Danzig &lt;ref&gt;''Japan Daily Mail,'' Sept. 18, 1901, Vol. 36, p. 303. &lt;/ref&gt; The international press covered his every step.&lt;ref&gt;Pu-Yi, Aisin-Gioro,  ''From Emperor to Citizen: The Autobiography of Aisin-Gioro, Pu-Yi.''  Beijing: Foreign Language Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; During Ambassador Yin Chang's time in Germany, Kaiser Wilhelm II  took a personal interest in the problems of modernizing a country’s military forces.&lt;ref&gt;Afflerbach, Holger, Falkenhayn: Politische Denken ang Handeln im Kaiserreich.  Oldenburg: Wissenschaft verlag, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaiser taught Yin Chang much about the organization, training, discipline, and equipment of a modern army. During this time, Yin Chang was sent as ambassador to the Netherlands for a term. Back in Germany he arranged a state visit to China for [[Prince Adalbert of Prussia (1884–1948)|Prince Adalbert of Prussia]]. In 1905 he was recalled and returned to China and was appointed the director of the Nobles' College ({{lang|zh-tw|貴冑學堂總辦}}) in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;“Yin Chang interview: The Defiant Chinese.” The Christian Register, March 22, 1906. The Christian Register Association, Boston, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 he changed the traditional uniforms of the Chinese Army to uniforms modeled on those of the German Army &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reilley|first1=Ralph|title=Wartime Changes to the German Field Uniform|date=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At the same time, he ordered arms and ammunition from [[Krupp]] &lt;ref&gt; Morrison, G. E. The Correspondence of G. E. Morrison, 1895-1912. Page 615 &lt;/ref&gt;. Yin Chang was one of the reformers who abolished the [[Imperial Examination]] in the effort to modernize Chinese education, enabling educated students to choose a profession, including the military. In September 1906 he became Commander-in-Chief in Jiangbei ({{lang|zh-tw|江北提督}}), and two months later, became Army Chief of Staff({{lang|zh-tw|陸軍部右侍郎}}). In September 1908 he was reappointed as Chinese Ambassador to Germany, but because of the autumn military manoeuvres in Anhwei and the death of the Emperor and of the Dowager Empress Cixi, he did not proceed to his post until Spring 1909. In 1910 Yin Chang was recalled to China when he was appointed as acting President of the Board of War ({{lang|zh-tw|陸軍部尚書}}).&lt;ref name=Xu/&gt;&lt;ref name=who1&gt;''Who's Who in China 3rd ed.'' (1925), p.939.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaimusyô Zyôhôbu (1928), pp.4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the Xinhai Revolution and the Beiyang Government ===
In September&lt;ref&gt;According to Xu(main ed.) (2007), p. 2209. ''Who's Who in China 3rd ed.'' (1925), p. 938.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 Yin Chang was the Chief of Staff of all the Army divisions stationed in the vicinity of Beijing ({{lang|zh-tw|訓練近畿陸軍各鎮大臣}}). Three months later, Yin Chang became the first Minister of War in [[Yikuang, Prince Qing|Prince Qing]]'s Cabinet by consolidating the different branches of the military under his aegis. As Minister of War Yin Chang set out to achieve three objectives: 1) greater efficiency and economy in his ministry; 2) improvement to the military profession; 3) establishing a national chain of command for the military under the ministry. To instill a sense of professionalism he ordered all officers to wear uniforms at work. They also had to use military salutes on all occasions, official and civil. He did succeed in fostering a sense of patriotism throughout the Army as evidenced by a new respect and pride in the military profession.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund S.K. Fung,  ''The Military Dimension of the Chinese Revolution: The New Army and Its Role in the Revolution of 1911.''  Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1980, pp. 47-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the first Minister of War, Yin Chang was dedicated to educating the population of the country with general information about the military and the function and responsibilities of the army. He wanted to create a sense of patriotism by making the military a subject in schools, and the Imperial University added a military course to the curriculum. He required military drills and instruction as well as physical education included in the curriculum of middle and primary schools. Yin Chang’s efforts at reform encountered opposition from traditionalists, officials protecting their interests and sinecures, and provincial governments guarding their power. The Manchu Dynasty fell before the results of his work became evident. Different aspects of it were taken up by succeeding regimes for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Fung, ''The Military Dimension of the Chinese Revolution.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 1911 Yin Chang attained the rank of full general but also remained in the Cabinet. On the outbreak of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in August of that year, General Yin Chang was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial forces and sent [[Battle of Yangxia|to quell the revolutionary army]] in [[Hubei]].&lt;ref&gt;“The Revolution Starts,” San Francisco Call, Oct. 25, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his command of the army of the Qing Dynasty was countermanded by Prime Minister [[Yuan Shikai]] as soon as he reached the front together with his troops, thus leaving vital weapons and ammunition factories unprotected.&lt;ref&gt;Prescott Clarke, A Research Guide to China Coast Newspapers 1822-1911. Harvard East Asian Monographs, ed. Frank H.H. King. Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to Beijing he was appointed Chief of the General Staff but resigned from his post as Yuan established his Cabinet.&lt;ref name=Xu/&gt;&lt;ref name=who1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gai1&gt;Gaimusyô Zyôhôbu (1928), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that had Marshal Yin Chang been allowed to remain in Hubeii, the revolution might not have been a success.&lt;ref&gt;According to ''Who's Who in China 3rd ed.'' (1925), p.939&lt;/ref&gt;

When the monarchy was abolished in 1912, Yin Chang resigned his post in the cabinet on the Day of the Princes, when one Mongol and eight Manchu princes collectively resigned.&lt;ref&gt; P. H. Kent, ''The Passing of the Manchus.'' London: Edward Arnold (1912).&lt;/ref&gt; After the establishment of the Republic of China, Yin Chang was invited to be the High Diplomatic Advisor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. &lt;ref&gt;Erik Nystrom, ''Det Nya Kina [The New China].''

Book from the collection of Marshal Yinchang's great-grandson, Alexander Ruas, Stockholm.&lt;/ref&gt; Even while serving as an official of the Republic, as a private citizen, with a relationship to Prince Chun, Yin Chang pledged undying loyalty to the deposed Emperor, Pu-Yi.&lt;ref&gt;Pu-Yi, Aisin-Gioro, ''From Emperor to Citizen,'' p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1912 Yin Chang was reappointed a Full General and was appointed to be Military Chief of Staff to President Yuan Shikai ({{lang|zh-tw|總統府軍事處處長}})&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the American Asiatic Association, Vol. 12, 1912&lt;/ref&gt;, a position he resigned in 1915 when Yuan Shikai declared himself Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;“Change and Reaction: Resistance, Change, New Talent. Chicago Commerce, Vol. 2, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1917 he became Commander in Chief of the General Staff for the Republic. In January 1919 he was reappointed to Military Chief of Staff to the President by [[Xu Shichang]], a position he held for succeeding presidents Li Yuan-hung, Feng Kuo-chang, and Hau Shih-chang.&lt;ref&gt; Howard Boorman, ed. Biographical Dictionary of Republican China. 4 vols.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last years of his life he served as Military Adviser to Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. In October 1923 he received the title of Marshal with "Zhuang Wei" ({{lang|zh-tw|莊威將軍}}). He died in Beijing in 1928.&lt;ref name=Xu/&gt;&lt;ref name=who1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gai1/&gt;
