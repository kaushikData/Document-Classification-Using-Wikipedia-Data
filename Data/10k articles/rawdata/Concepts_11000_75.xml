'''Andrew Norman Wilson''' (born 27 October 1950)&lt;ref name="britannica1"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/A-N-Wilson Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; is an English writer and newspaper columnist known for his critical biographies, novels and works of popular history. He is an occasional columnist for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and a former columnist for the ''[[London Evening Standard]]''. He has been an occasional contributor to ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', ''[[New Statesman]]'', ''[[The Spectator]]'' and ''[[The Observer]]''.

==Life and work==
Wilson was born in [[Stone, Staffordshire|Stone]] in [[Staffordshire]]&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt; to a father who became the managing director of [[Wedgwood]], the pottery company.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Hunter|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/interview-in-bed-with-a-n-wilson-he-may-be-sick-but-he-hasnt-lost-his-sense-of-humour-a-s-byatt-the-1478063.html|title=Interview: In Bed With A.N. Wilson|work=The Independent|date=12 January 1993|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at Hillstone School, Great Malvern in Worcestershire, and [[Rugby School]] from the age of 13, where he read Mao and Marx in his spare time. While at Rugby, he wrote an article for the school magazine arguing that public schools should be abolished. The national press became interested in the story, with the ''[[Daily Express]]'' headlining its account "Red rebel in Tom Brown's school".&lt;ref name="Leith"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leith|first=William|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/interview-messing-with-the-messiah-william-leith-meets-a-n-wilson-the-man-of-letters-who-upset-the-1551051.html|title=Interview: Messing with the Messiah|work=The Independent|date=12 September 1992|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Reporters arrived at the school gates, wanting to interview me, but my housemaster, wisely, would not let me talk to them," Wilson told [[Hunter Davies]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt; After [[New College, Oxford]], he taught English at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood]] for two years and then spent seven years as a lecturer in medieval literature at [[St Hugh's College, Oxford|St Hugh's College]] and New College, Oxford. He married the Shakespearean scholar [[Katherine Duncan-Jones]] in 1971. They had two daughters, [[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Emily Wilson]] (born 1971) and [[Bee Wilson|Beatrice "Bee" Wilson]] (born 1974), and divorced in 1990.

A prolific journalist and author of non-fiction, Wilson has also written over twenty works of fiction, for which he has won the [[Somerset Maugham Prize]] and the [[John Llewellyn Rhys Prize]]. His novels also include such historical works as ''[[The Potter’s Hand]]'' (a study of the family life of [[Josiah Wedgwood]]), ''[[Resolution (A. N. Wilson novel)|Resolution]]'', a fictional account of Captain James Cook’s second voyage, and ''[[Scandal (Wilson novel)|Scandal]]'' about the Profumo affair. His 2007 novel ''[[Winnie and Wolf]]'', about the relationship between [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Richard Wagner]]'s English daughter-in-law, was long-listed for the [[Man Booker Prize]]. Novels set in the present include ''[[The Vicar of Sorrows]]'', about a clergyman who has lost his faith dealing with the death of his mother, and ''[[Dream Children]]'' about paedophilia. 

In the early 1990s, in the wake of the Fatwah against Salman Rushdie and the continuing troubles in Northern Ireland, Wilson published a pamphlet, ''[[Against Religion]]'', in the [[Chatto &amp; Windus]] CounterBlasts series. He wrote biographies of Jesus and St Paul, and a history of atheism in the 19th century entitled ''[[God's Funeral]]'', describing its growth as due to influences ranging from [[David Hume]] to [[Sigmund Freud]]. These and many other of his books such as those on [[Leo Tolstoy]] ([[Whitbread Award]] for best biography of 1988), [[C. S. Lewis]], [[Hilaire Belloc]] are simultaneously sympathetic to religious belief and critical of it.

In August 2006, Wilson's biography of [[John Betjeman]] was published. It was later discovered that another biographer, [[Bevis Hillier]], had sent him a forged letter which was included in the book.&lt;ref name="wilson reply"&gt;{{cite news

In 2001 Wilson published ''[[Dante in Love]]'' (2011) presenting a study of the great Italian poet, [[Dante Alighieri]], as an artist and philosopher, also depicting an in-depth portrait of medieval [[Florence]] to help readers understand the literary and cultural background which engendered the Tuscan's masterpiece, ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''.

In addition to his many biographies, Wilson has written three books covering entire eras, ''[[The Victorians]]'' (2002), ''[[After the Victorians]]'' (2005), and ''[[The Elizabethans]]'' (2011).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} 

===Critiques of Wilson's work===
&lt;!--Add material referred to in Criticism section--&gt;
The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' said that "Wilson's forte is the character and he brilliantly conveys Betjeman's odd mixture of introspection and sociability, gaiety and melancholia, exhibition and self-disgust..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3654881/Lucky-to-have-him.html|title=Lucky to Have him: Lynn Barber reviews Betjeman by A N Wilson|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' (London) called his book ''[[Resolution (A. N. Wilson)|Resolution]]'' ‘a work of genius’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/resolution-a-novel-of-captain-cooks-adventures-of-discovery-to-australia-new-zealand-and-hawaii-through-the-eyes-of-george-forster-the-botanist-on-board-his-ship-by-an-wilson-gghjndmt5|title=Resolution by AN Wilson Reviewed by James Marriott|website=www.thetimes.co.uk|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kathryn Hughes]] wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' of Wilson’s biography of [[Queen Victoria]], ''[[Victoria: A Life]]'', ‘Subtle, thoughtful ... a shimmering and rather wonderful biography.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/04/victoria-a-life-a-n-wilson-review-queen|title=Victoria: A Life Review by Kathryn Hughes|website=www.theguardian.com|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daisy Godwin in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' review stated that, ‘This won't be the last biography of Victoria but it is certainly the most interesting and original in a long time’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria: A Life by AN Wilson Review by Daisy Godwin|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/victoria-a-life-by-an-wilson-6zl7vt6chkx|website=www.thetimes.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson's ''[[Hitler: A Short Biography]]'' was criticised by the historian [[Richard J. Evans]] in a review in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' for factual inaccuracies, lack of original research and analysis, and personal biases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|title=Hitler: A Short Biography|work=New Statesman|date=12 March 2012|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2012/03/hitler-wilson-german-british|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson's biography ''Charles Darwin, Victorian Mythmaker'', (2017), was criticised by [[John van Wyhe]] in the ''New Scientist'' for confusing [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]] with [[Lamarckism]] at one point, as well as other scientific, historical and editorial errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2144643-radical-new-biography-of-darwin-is-unreliable-and-inaccurate/|title=‘Radical’ new biography of Darwin is unreliable and inaccurate|last=van Wyhe|first=John|work=[[New Scientist]]|date=21 August 2017|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathryn Hughes in ''[[The Guardian]]'' described it as a "cheap attempt to ruffle feathers", with a dubious grasp of science and attempted [[character assassination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/30/charles-darwin-victorian-mythmaker-an-wilson-review|title=Charles Darwin by AN Wilson review – how wrong can a biography be?|last=Hughes|first=Kathryn|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 August 2017|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Evening Standard]]'', Adrian Woolfson says that "..while for the greater part a lucid, elegantly written and thought-provoking social and intellectual history" Wilson's "speculations on evolutionary theory," produce a book that is "fatally flawed, mischievous, and ultimately misleading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/books/charles-darwin-victorian-mythmaker-by-an-wilson-review-a3619306.html|title=Charles Darwin Victorian Mythmaker by A.N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13375">A charged [[particle accelerator]] is a complex machine that takes elementary charged particles and accelerates them to very high energies.  [[Accelerator physics]] is a field of physics encompassing all the aspects required to design and operate the equipment and to understand the resulting dynamics of the charged particles.  There are software packages associated with each such domain. There are a large number of such codes. The 1990 edition of the Los Alamos Accelerator Code Group's compendium &lt;ref&gt;Computer Codes for Particle Accelerator Design and Analysis: A Compendium, Second Edition, Helen Stokes Deaven and Kwok Chi Dominic Chen, Los Alamos National Laboratory report number LA-UR-90-1766, 290 pages (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; provides summaries of more than 200 codes. Certain of those codes are still in use today although many are obsolete. Another index of existing and historical accelerator simulation codes is located at &lt;ref&gt;[https://oraweb.cern.ch/pls/hhh/code_website.disp_allcat the CERN CARE/HHH website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213000308/https://oraweb.cern.ch/pls/hhh/code_website.disp_allcat |date=December 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Single particle dynamics codes==
For many applications it is sufficient to track a single particle through the relevant electric and magnetic fields.
Old unmaintained codes include: BETA&lt;ref&gt;[http://care-hhh.web.cern.ch/care%2Dhhh/Simulation-Codes/Optics/Literature/BETA_MANUAL.pdf user's guide]&lt;/ref&gt;, AGS, ALIGN, COMFORT, DESIGN, DIMAD, GUINEA-PIG, HARMON, LEGO, LIAR, MAGIC, MARYLIE, PATRICIA, PETROS, PLACET, RACETRACK, SYNCH, TRACY and variants&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/projects/libtracy/ libtracy at sourceforge.net]&lt;/ref&gt;, TRANSPORT, TURTLE, and UAL.

===Columns===

;Spin Tracking
:Tracking of a particle's [[Spin (physics)|spin]].

;Taylor Maps
:Construction of Taylor series maps that can be used for simulating particle motion and also can be used for such things as extracting single particle resonance strengths.

;Collective effects
:The interactions between the particles in the beam can have important effects on the behavior, control and dynamics. Collective effects take different forms from [[Intrabeam Scattering]] (IBS) which is a direct particle-particle interaction to wakefields which are mediated by the vacuum chamber wall of the machine the particles are traveling in. In general, the effect of direct particle-particle interactions is less with higher energy particle beams. At very low energies, space charge has a large effect on a particle beam and thus becomes hard to calculate. The above simulation codes do not handle low energy  space charge effects. See below for a list of programs that can handle low energy space charge forces.

;Synchrotron radiation tracking
:Ability to track the [[synchrotron radiation]] (mainly [[X-ray]]s) produced by the acceleration of charged particles.

;Extensible
:Object oriented coding to make it relatively easy to extend the capabilities.

==Space Charge Codes==
The self interaction (e.g. space charge) of the charged particle beam can cause growth of the beam, such as with bunch lengthening, or intrabeam scattering. Additionally, space charge effects may cause instabilities and associated beam loss. Typically the Poisson equation is solved at intervals during the tracking using [[Particle-in-cell]] algorithms. Space charge effects lessen at higher energies so at higher energies the space charge effects may be modeled using simpler algorithms that are computationally much faster than the algorithms used at lower energies.
Codes that handle low energy space charge effects, including computation of growth values and instability thresholds, include:

==Impedance computation codes==
An important class of collective effects may be summarized in terms of the beams response to an "[[impedance (Accelerator Physics)|impedance]]".  An important job is thus the computation of this impedance for the machine.  Codes for this computation include

* VSim &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.txcorp.com/vsim VSim at Tech-X]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magnet and other hardware-modeling codes==
To control the charged particle beam, appropriate electric and magnetic fields must be created.  There are software packages to help in the design and understanding of the magnets, RF cavities, and other elements that create these fields. Codes include
*ACE3P &lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

* VSim &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.txcorp.com/vsim VSim at Tech-X]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lattice file format and data interchange issues==
Given the variety of modelling tasks, there is not one common data format that has developed.
For describing the layout of an accelerator and the corresponding elements, one uses a so-called "lattice file".
There have been numerous attempts at unifying the lattice file formats used in different codes.  One unification attempt is the Accelerator Markup Language, and the Universal Accelerator Parser.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lepp.cornell.edu/~dcs/aml/ Description of AML and UAP at cornell.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another attempt at a unified approach to accelerator codes is the UAL or Universal Accelerator Library.&lt;ref&gt;See references by N. Malitsky and Talman such as [http://www.bnl.gov/isd/documents/24937.pdf this manual from 2002].&lt;/ref&gt;

The file formats used in
MAD may be the most common, with translation routines available to convert to an input form needed for a different code. 
Associated with the Elegant code is a data format called SDDS, with an associated suite of tools.  If one uses a Matlab-based code, such as Accelerator Toolbox, one has available all the tools within Matlab.

==Codes in applications of particle accelerators==
There are many applications of particle accelerators.  For example, two important applications are elementary [[particle physics]] and [[synchrotron radiation]] production.  When performing a modeling task for any accelerator operation, the results of charged particle beam dynamics simulations must feed into the associated application.  Thus, for a full simulation, one must include the codes in associated applications.  For particle physics, the simulation may be continued in a detector with a code such as [[Geant4]].  

For a synchrotron radiation facility, for example, the electron beam produces an x-ray beam that then travels down a [[beamline]] before reaching the experiment.  Thus, the electron beam modeling software must interface with the [[x-ray optics]] modelling software such as SRW,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrf.eu/Accelerators/Groups/InsertionDevices/Software/SRW SRW home page at esrf.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; Shadow,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrf.eu/computing/scientific/raytracing/ Shadow home page at esrf.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; McXTrace,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcxtrace.org/ McXTrace home page at mcxtrace.org]&lt;/ref&gt; or Spectra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiant.harima.riken.go.jp/spectra/ Spectra home page at riken.go.jp]&lt;/ref&gt; Bmad&lt;ref name="cornell1"/&gt; can model both X-rays and charged particle beams.  The x-rays are used in an experiment which may be modeled and analyzed with various software, such as the DAWN science platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawnsci.org DAWN science platform website]&lt;/ref&gt; OCELOT &lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/iagapov/ocelot]&lt;/ref&gt; also includes both synchrotron radiation calculation and x-ray propagation models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3217">{{Antennas|characteristics}}

In [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] theory, antenna efficiency is most often used to mean '''radiation efficiency'''. In the context of antennas, one often just speaks of "efficiency." It is a measure of the [[electrical efficiency]] with which a radio antenna converts the radio-frequency power accepted at its terminals into radiated power. Likewise, in a receiving antenna it describes the proportion of the radio wave's power intercepted by the antenna which is actually delivered as an electrical signal. It is not to be confused with [[Aperture efficiency (antennas)|aperture efficiency]] which applies to aperture antennas such as the [[parabolic reflector]].

==Definition==

Radiation efficiency is defined by [[IEEE]] Std 145-1993&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Std 145-1993, Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas, {{ISBN|1-55937-317-2}}, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IEEESTD.1993.119664 IEEEXplore]&lt;/ref&gt; "Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas" as "The ratio of the total power radiated by an antenna to the net power accepted by the antenna from the connected transmitter." It is sometimes expressed as a percentage (less than 100), and is frequency dependent.  It can also be described in [[decibels]]. 

For wire antennas which have a defined [[radiation resistance]] the radiation efficiency is the ratio of the radiation resistance to the total resistance of the antenna including ground loss (see below) and conductor resistance. &lt;ref&gt;Weelkes, W.J, (1968), ''Antenna Engineering'', McGraw Hill Book Company, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; In practical cases the resistive loss in any tuning and/or matching network is often included, although network loss is strictly not a property of the antenna.  

For other types of antenna the radiation efficiency is less easy to calculate and is usually determined by measurements.  

The [[antenna gain|gain]] of an antenna is the [[directivity]] multiplied by the radiation efficiency, as described in Std 145-1993.    

==Ground loss==

For [[monopole antenna|monopole]] and other ground-based antennas, ground loss occurs due to ohmic [[electrical resistance|resistance]] in the antenna's connection to its ground plane/counterpoise, including its mast or stalk and its bonding connections, as well as the ohmic resistance encountered by radio-frequency currents in the ground plane in the vicinity of the antenna.

==Aperture efficiency==
{{main|Aperture efficiency (antennas)}}
This is a distinct concept applied to aperture antennas such as a [[parabolic antenna]] and is a measure of the reduction in power gain caused by non-uniform aperture illumination by the feed antenna.  In a typical situation the reflector is illuminated with a reduced power-density at the edge compared with the centre, in order to reduce [[side lobe|sidelobes]] and other effects.  This causes a reduction in gain: the ratio of the gain of the tapered aperture distribution to the theoretical gain of a uniformly illuminated aperture is the aperture efficiency. &lt;ref&gt;Weelkes, W.J, (1968), ''Antenna Engineering'', McGraw Hill Book Company, pp. 256-258&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ArtRage''' is a [[bitmap graphics editor]] for [[digital painting]] created by Ambient Design Ltd. It is currently in version 5.0.5, and supports [[Windows]], [[macOS]] and mobile Apple and Android devices and is available in multiple languages. It caters to all ages and skill levels, from children to professional artists. ArtRage 5 was announced for January 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='ArtRage 5 Coming Soon' Holiday Sale|url=https://www.artrage.com/artrage-5-coming-soon-holiday-sale/|website=ArtRage|publisher=Ambient Design|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finally released in February 2017.&lt;ref name="ArtRage5 is Here"&gt;{{cite web|title=‘ArtRage 5 is Here!|url=https://www.artrage.com/artrage-5-live/|website=ArtRage|publisher=Ambient Design|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is designed to be used with a [[Tablet computer|tablet PC]] or [[graphics tablet]], but it can be used with a regular mouse as well. Its mediums include tools such as [[oil paint]], [[spray paint]], [[pencil]], [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]], and others, using relatively realistic physics to simulate actual painting. Other tools include tracing, smearing, blurring, mixing, symmetry, different types of paper for the "canvas" (i.e. crumpled paper, smooth paper, wrinkled tin foil, etc.), as well as special effects, custom brushes and basic digital editing tools.

==Traditional media simulation and tools==
[[File:Texture and real colour blending in ArtRage 4.png|thumb|A quick demonstration of the blendable texture of paint and the realistic colour mixing in ArtRage 4]]
[[File:ArtRage 4 Traditional Media Tools.png|thumb|An example of the painting tools in ArtRage 4: Gloop Pen, Airbrush, Glitter, Ink Pen, Pencil, Oil Brush, Watercolor, Paint Tube, Paint Roller, Pastel/Chalk, Pencil, Felt Pen]]ArtRage is designed to be as realistic as possible. This includes varying thickness and textures of media and canvas, the ability to mix media, and a realistic colour blending option as well as the standard digital RGB blending. It includes a wide array of real life tools, as well as Stencils, scrap layers to use as scrap paper or mixing palettes and the option to integrate reference or tracing images. The later versions (Studio, Studio Pro and ArtRage 4) include more standard digital tools, such as Select, Transform, Cloner, Symmetry, Fill and custom brushes ("Sticker").

Each tool is highly customisable, and comes with several presets. It is possible to share custom resources between users and there is a reasonably active ArtRage community that creates and shares presets, canvases, custom brushes, stencils, colour palettes and other resources.

'''Real colour blending'''

ArtRage offers a realistic colour blending option as well as standard digital RGB based blending. It is turned off by default as it is memory intensive but can be turned on from the Tools menu. The most noticeable effect is that green is produced when yellow and blue are mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSK7n9rZegU| title=Mixing Colors with ArtRage|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The color picker supports [[HSL and HSV|HSL]] and [[RGB]] colors.

===Custom resources===

One of the less well known features of ArtRage is the custom resource options. Users can create their own versions of various resources and tools, or record scripts, and share them with other users. Users can save their resource collections as a Package File (.arpack), which acts similar to a ZIP file. It allows folders of resources to be shared and automatically installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'How to' thread for downloading and installing ArtRage Resources|url=http://forums.artrage.com/showthread.php?18574-The-How-to-thread-for-downloading-and-installing-ArtRage-Resources|work=ArtRage Forums|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ArtRage can import some Photoshop filters, but not all. It only supports .ttf ([[TrueType|TrueType Fonts]]) which it reads from the computer's fonts folder.

Package files do not work with versions earlier than 3.5. ArtRage Studio does not support Photoshop filters, or allow sticker creation, and has fewer options overall.
Alternatively, individual resources can be shared directly. Most of the resources have specific file types.

==Versions==
ArtRage comes in seven current editions. The mobile apps are ArtRage for Android, ArtRage Oil Painter Free for Android, ArtRage for iPhone, and ArtRage for iPad. A version called ArtRage Touch is also available in the Windows App Store for Metro devices. The desktop versions are ArtRage Lite and ArtRage 4. A free demo version of ArtRage 4 is also available. ArtRage 1, ArtRage 2, ArtRage Studio and ArtRage Studio Pro have been discontinued.

Ambient Design releases a new edition of ArtRage on three to four yearly upgrade cycle. There is a major free update halfway through this cycle (the X.5 edition) and ongoing free patches and minor updates. Some updates continue for the previous version, although support is slowly phased out over time. For example, backdated upgrades to Studio Pro included bug fixes, DRM removal for Steam users, and a fix to allow it to work properly on [[OS X Mavericks]], and the iPad version was updated to include [[Retina Display|Retina]] support.

ArtRage is also available through Steam. It was part of the very first non-gaming software launch on Steam, on October 10, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/100970/news|title=Now Available - Software on Steam, 10% off! |last=Steam|date=October 10, 2012|journal=Steam Community}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Steam version does not include DRM and can be used without Steam running.

===Languages===

ArtRage 4 is available in several languages, but the manual is only available in English. The other versions have manuals available in assorted languages. Language is chosen when installing the program (except for the ArtRage 2 alternative editions).

'''Free demo versions'''

These were released alongside their respective editions, as trial software. The earlier editions have been discontinued, and only the current ArtRage 4 demo is now available. Work can only be exported to [[JPEG]] format and contains an ArtRage watermark. Images larger than 1280x1024 cannot be saved or exported.

* ArtRage 2.2 Free Edition: limited trial version
* Studio Pro Demo Edition: full trial version with some restrictions, expires after 30 days
* ArtRage 4 Demo edition: full trial version with some restrictions
* ArtRage Touch: one week trial through the Windows App Store
* ArtRage Oil Painter Free : limited free app on the Play Store and Amazon App Store
* ArtRage for Android: free download on some Samsung devices via the Galaxy Gifts program

===Software downloads===
[[Image:ArtRage Painting of Temple Showing Different Pen Types.png|right|thumb|Pen Types]]

ArtRage is only sold individually as an online download. It can be bought directly from the company website, or through Steam, but is not sold on any other websites. The free demo is only available from the main site. The mobile (iPad and iPhone) versions can only be bought via the Apple app store and cannot be registered on the ArtRage site. The Android version is available from the GALAXY Gift store for specific Samsung devices, and will be made available on the Samsung Apps and Google Play stores.

====Upgrades====

Upgrading from ArtRage Lite or any pre-existing desktop editions gives a permanent 50% discount on ArtRage 4 (the most recent full desktop edition). This upgrade discount is handled separately by the Steam and the ArtRage stores, so users cannot currently switch between stores.

To upgrade, owners must register their serial number in the [http://members.artrage.com/ ArtRage members area] (unless it is a Steam or mobile version). This also allows users to download both the macOS and the Windows versions of their software at any time, an unlimited number of times.

Steam and mobile versions are updated through Steam and the App Store.

===Hardware bundles===

The ArtRage for Android app was released as part of a bundle deal with [[Samsung]]. It is free for the new [[Samsung Galaxy Note series|Samsung Galaxy Note 4]] and Samsung Galaxy Note Edge smartphones, distributed through the GALAXY Gifts store, and is available for purchase from the Galaxy App store for other Samsung devices. It was released for sale on the Google Play Store in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambient Design|title=ArtRage for Android now on the Google Play Store|url=http://www.artrage.com/artrage-android-now-google-play-store/|website=www.artrage.com|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ArtRage Lite comes free with the Wacom Intuos Draw tablet.

The older editions of ArtRage also come as bundled software with various devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ArtRage as Bundled Software|url=http://www.artrage.com/faqs/artrage-bundled-software/|website=artrage.com|publisher=Ambient Design|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ArtRage 2 and ArtRage Studio Pro are still available bundled with several [[Wacom (company)|WACOM]] [[graphics tablet]]s, as well as various other devices, such as ASUS EP121 tablets, Sony VAIO Laptops, and Adesso Cybertablets. The serial numbers in these cases are handled by the companies distributing the hardware. ArtRage is usually provided as a software download, although it can come pre-installed or on an accompanying CD.

A version of ArtRage called "Ink Art" was included in Microsoft's Experience Pack for the Tablet PC in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-nz/download/details.aspx?id=13797x|title=Microsoft Experience Pack for Tablet PC|last=Microsoft|date=April 4, 2005|journal=Microsoft Download Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on some older Wacom tablets. Ink Art contained a [[subset]] of features offered in the full ArtRage program. [[Promethean Planet]], an educator community, distributes a free version of ArtRage for classroom use on Promethean's range of interactive whiteboards.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}.

&lt;br&gt;∞∞ Windows XP support was dropped in the 4.5 update.

===Stylus support===

ArtRage 4 supports various Wacom stylus features, although they may vary depending on the tool being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ArtRage 4 Features: Stylus Support|url=http://www.artrage.com/artrage-4/features/#stylus|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pressure, Tilt, Airbrush Wheel, and Barrel Rotation
*Wacom Stylus Recognition
*Live Tilt (4.5 only)

ArtRage for iPad supports four Bluetooth stylus brands, as well as the [[Apple Pencil]], which has full pressure and tilt support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ArtRage for iPad Stylus Support|url=https://www.artrage.com/manuals/artrage-mobile-editions/artrage-ipad/stylus-support/|publisher=Ambient Design}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Wacom 
* TenOne Pogo Connect 
* Adonit Jot Touch Pro
* Adobe Creative

ArtRage for Android supports the native Android system for pressure sensitivity, including the Samsung S Pen.

The desktop editions of ArtRage fully support the following Windows [[Graphics tablet]] and [[Tablet computer]] drivers:&lt;ref name="Ambient Design"/&gt;
*AES (ArtRage 4.5.10 onwards)
*WinTab
*RealTime Stylus
*Ink Services (ArtRage 2 only)

===Supported file types===
ArtRage uses a proprietary file type, ".ptg", which stands for "painting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambient Design|title=What Does PTG Stand For?|url=http://www.artrage.com/faqs/ptg-stand/|website=artrage.com/|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can only save as PTG and can only open PSD and PTG files using the File|Open command. However, images can be exported to the following formats: [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[JPEG]], [[GIF]], [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[TIFF]] and [[Adobe Photoshop]]'s [[.psd]] format. ArtRage can import all of these file types using the File &gt; Import Image or Import Image as Layer command. Importing PTG files will open the PNG used for thumbnail images instead (this can be used to rescue images from corrupted PTG files).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to recover a damaged ArtRage painting|url=http://www.artrage.com/faqs/recover-damaged-artrage-painting/|website=artrage.com|publisher=Ambient Design|accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''*Only when exported as an individual layer''

'''Transparency'''&lt;br&gt;
ArtRage supports transparency on imported files, but not on all exported files (for example, GIF and TIFF). It is often easier to export a transparent image as an individual layer, as the Canvas settings can save as opaque on full saves for some file types and in older editions.

'''''Augoeides''''' is an obscure term meaning "luminous body" and thought to refer to the [[planets]]. [[Aleister Crowley]] considered the term to refer to the [[Holy Guardian Angel]] of [[The Book of Abramelin|Abramelin]]; the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] of [[Hinduism]] the [[Daemon (classical mythology)|Daemon]] of the [[ancient Greeks]]. Robert Lomas associates the term with the ''Higher Self'' or soul of the individual&lt;ref&gt;Lomas, Robert. ''The Secret Science of Masonic Initiation''. San Francisco: Weiser, 2010, pp.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Etymology==
It appears that [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] used it and [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] commented on it. The term is encountered in the literature of [[Neo-Platonic]] [[theurgy]] and was popularized in the 19th and 20th centuries by the [[Theosophists]], [[Freemasons]], and the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].

To quote [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]]'s comment on Porphyry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are afterwards sent through ample Elysium, and a few of us possess the joyful plains: till a long period, when the revolving orb of time has perfected its circulation, frees the soul from its concrete stains, and leaves the etherial sense pure, together with the fire (or splendour) of simple ether." For here he evidently conjoins the rational soul, or the etherial sense, with its splendid vehicle, or the fire of simple ether; since it is well known that this vehicle, according to Plato, is rendered by proper purgation 'augoeides', or luciform, and divine. It must here however be observed that souls in these meadows of asphodel, or summit of Pluto's empire, are in a falling state; or in other words through the secret influx of matter begin to desire a terrene situation. And this explains the reason why Hercules in the infernal regions is represented by Homer boasting of his terrene exploits and glorying in his pristine valour; why Achilles laments his situation in these abodes; and souls in general are engaged in pursuits similar to their employment on the earth: for all this is the natural consequence of a propensity to a mortal nature, and a desertion of the regions every way lucid and divine. Let the reader too observe, that, according to the arcana of the Platonic doctrine, the first and truest seat of the soul is in the intelligible world, where she lives entirely divested of body, and enjoys the ultimate felicity of her nature. And this is what Homer divinely insinuates when he says: "after this I saw the Herculean power, or image: but Hercules himself is with the immortal gods, delighting in celestial banquets, and enjoying the beautiful-footed Hebe." Since for the soul to dwell with the gods, entirely separated from its vehicle, is to abide in the intelligible world, and to exercise, as Plotinus expresses it, the more sacred contests of wisdom.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To quote H.P. [[Blavatsky]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most substantial difference consisted in the location of the immortal or divine spirit of man. While the ancient Neoplatonists held that the Augoeides never descends hypostatically into the living man, but only more or less sheds its radiance on the inner man – the astral soul – the Kabalists of the Middle Ages maintained that the spirit, detaching itself from the ocean of light and spirit, entered into man's soul, where it remained through life imprisoned in the astral capsule. This difference was the result of the belief of [[Christian Kabalists]], more or less, in the dead letter of the allegory of the fall of man.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In referencing of the Hellenic origin of the word, it might be understood to emerge from 'αυγο', meaning 'egg', or 'αυγή', meaning 'dawn', combined of 'είδηση', indicative of 'news' or 'a message', and thus the connection in Aleister Crowley's mind between the 'egg message' and 'the Knowledge &amp; Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel' or 'higher &amp; original (egg) genius' associated of one's human being. Combined of 'είδωλο', an 'idol' or 'reflection', one might see in it Plato's 'luminous being', a 'reflection of the dawn'. Such a direct etymology is, however, admittedly speculative and subject to revision or reconfirmation by another.

'''Bhumika''' ([[Sanskrit]]: भूमिका) is derived from the word, ''Bhūmi'', which means – the earth, soil, ground, land, a site, situation, land, a story, character or part or situation. The word, ''Bhūmikā'', refers to a tablet or board for writing, subject, object or a receptacle, theatrical dress or an actor’s costume, decoration of an image, a preface or introduction to a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Sthaviravāda Saravastivada'' tradition of [[Buddhism]] amongst the 49/52 mental factors (''Bhūmikās'') are the ten ''mahā-bhūmikās'' which are common to all consciousness are – '' [[Vedanā]] '' (feeling), '' [[Saññā]] '' (perception), '' [[Cetanā]] '' (volition), '' [[Phassa]] '' (contact), '' [[Chanda (Buddhism)|Chanda]] '' (desire to act), '' [[Paññā]] '' (wisdom), '' [[Sati (Buddhism)|Sati]] '' (mindfulness), '' [[Manasikāra]] '' (attention), '' [[Adhimokkha]] '' (decision), '' [[Samādhi]] '' (mental concentration)or '' [[Ekaggata]] '' (one-pointedness),

The [[Upanishads]] speak about the seven ''bhūmikās'' or ''jñānabhūmis'' (fields of knowledge) or the seven stages of development of wisdom, and about the four kinds of ''jivanmuktas''. In Chapter IV of the Varahā [[Upanishad]], with regard to the characteristics of ''jivanmukti'', [[Ribhu]] tells Nigadha that the first ''bhūmikā'' or stage of development is ''subhechchha'' or good desires; the second ''bhūmikā'' is ''vichārāna'' or inquiry; the third ''bhūmikā'' is ''[[Tanumanasi|tanumānasī]]'' or pertaining to the thinned mind; the fourth ''bhūmikā'' is ''sattvāpatti'' or the attainment of ''sattva''; the fifth ''bhūmikā'' is ''asamśakti'' or non-attachment; the sixth ''bhūmikā'' is ''padārthabhāvanā'' or analysis of objects, and the seventh ''bhūmikā'' is ''[[turiya]] '' or the final stage. Nigadha is also told that the bhūmikā which is of the form of ''[[Om|pranava]] '' is formed of ''akāra'', ''ukāra'', ''makāra'' and the ''ardhamātra''.  The ''turiya'' essence of ''akāra'' embraces the first, second and the third ''bhūmikās'' whose function is called ''mumukshu''; the ''turiya'' essence of ''ukāra'' embraces the fourth bhūmikā when the mind is firmly fixed on the non-dual and is called ''brahmavit''; the ''turiya'' essence of ''makāra'' embraces the fifth ''bhūmikā'' or ''sushuptipada'' (dreamless sleep) and is called ''brahmavidvara''; the ''turiya'' essence of ''ardhamātra'' embraces the sixth ''bhūmikā'' (dreamless state) and is called ''brahmavidvariya'', beyond which is the seventh ''bhūmikā'' or ''gudhasupti'' and is called ''brahmavidvarishta'' when one remains in the secondless state without fear and with his consciousness almost annihilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thirty-Minor Upanishads|author=IslamKotob|page=232|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CvXZ0j1UyAAC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=sakshi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JCUxU9rTCsWKrQflmICgAg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bond vigilante''' is a [[bond (finance)|bond]] market investor who protests monetary or fiscal policies they consider inflationary by selling bonds, thus increasing [[Yield (finance)|yields]].&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;May 29, 2009. [http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a6eMpGVUDeeE&amp;refer=home Bloomberg - Bond Vigilantes Confront Obama as Housing Falters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123033802/http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a6eMpGVUDeeE&amp;refer=home |date=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the [[bond market]], prices move inversely to yields.  When investors perceive that inflation risk or credit risk is rising they demand higher yields to compensate for the added risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investmentrarities.com/thebestofrr04-29-04.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430095009/http://www.investmentrarities.com/thebestofrr04-29-04.html |archivedate=2008-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, bond prices fall and yields rise, which increases the net cost of borrowing. The term references the ability of the bond market to serve as a restraint on the government's ability to over-spend and over-borrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-bond-vigilantes-return-or-bad-ideas-never-die-2017-01-11 |title=Don’t expect the bond vigilantes to do the Fed’s work |date=January 11, 2017 |author=Caroline Baum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
===Clinton administration===
From October 1993 to November 1994 US 10-year yields climbed from 5.2% to just over 8.0% fueled by concerns about federal spending in what became informally known as the "[[Great Bond Massacre]]".  With some guidance from [[Robert Rubin]], the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], the Clinton Administration and Congress made an effort to reduce the deficit.  10-year yields dropped to approximately 4% by November 1998.&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt; 

Clinton political adviser [[James Carville]] said at the time that “I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody." &lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt;

===Obama administration===
During the Obama administration some suggest that bond vigilantes were making a return with worries over sustainability and budgetary responsibility.  Mark MacQueen, a partner and money manager at Austin, Texas-based Sage Advisory Services Ltd., said “The vigilante group is different this time around.  It’s major foreign creditors. This whole idea that we need to spend our way out of our problems is being questioned."&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt; However, economist [[Paul Krugman]] and other [[New Keynesian]]s pointed out that there was no evidence for bond vigilante activity by pointing out the fact that 10-year yields remained quite low.&lt;ref name="krugman"&gt;https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/invisible-bond-vigilantes/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eurozone==
During the [[Eurozone crisis]] that started in 2009, bond vigilantes were blamed for pushing up the government borrowing in the [[PIIGS]] countries.  However Ed Yardini, who coined the term Bond Vigilantes in the 1980s, said that actions of central banks were able to keep rates low against the pressure of the vigilantes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DQHLqhM2uA |title=Ed Yardeni: "Bond Vigilantes" Get to Work in the Eurozone |publisher=NZZ Capital Markets forum |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11795">In [[mathematics]], a '''Borel set''' is any set in a [[topological space]] that can be formed from [[open set]]s (or, equivalently, from [[closed set]]s) through the operations of [[countable]] [[union (set theory)|union]], countable [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]], and [[relative complement]].  Borel sets are named after [[Émile Borel]].

For a topological space ''X'', the collection of all Borel sets on ''X'' forms a [[sigma-algebra|&amp;sigma;-algebra]], known as the '''Borel algebra''' or '''Borel &amp;sigma;-algebra'''.  The Borel algebra on ''X'' is the smallest σ-algebra containing all open sets (or, equivalently, all closed sets).

Borel sets are important in [[measure theory]], since any measure defined on the open sets of a space, or on the closed sets of a space, must also be defined on all Borel sets of that space. Any measure defined on the Borel sets is called a [[Borel measure]].  Borel sets and the associated [[Borel hierarchy]] also play a fundamental role in [[descriptive set theory]].

In some contexts, Borel sets are defined to be generated by the [[compact set]]s of the topological space, rather than the open sets. The two definitions are equivalent for many [[well-behaved]] spaces, including all [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[σ-compact space]]s, but can be different in more [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] spaces.

== Generating the Borel algebra ==

In the case ''X'' is a [[metric space]], the Borel algebra in the first sense may be described ''generatively'' as follows.

For a collection ''T'' of subsets of ''X'' (that is, for any subset of the [[power set]] P(''X'') of ''X''), let
* &lt;math&gt;T_\sigma &lt;/math&gt; be all countable unions of elements of ''T''
* &lt;math&gt;T_\delta &lt;/math&gt; be all countable intersections of elements of ''T''
* &lt;math&gt; T_{\delta\sigma}=(T_\delta)_\sigma.&lt;/math&gt;

Now define by [[transfinite induction]] a sequence ''G&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''m'' is an [[ordinal number]], in the following manner:
* For the base case of the definition, let &lt;math&gt; G^0&lt;/math&gt; be the collection of open subsets of ''X''.
* If ''i'' is not a [[limit ordinal]], then ''i'' has an immediately preceding ordinal ''i &amp;minus; 1''. Let 
*: &lt;math&gt; G^i = [G^{i-1}]_{\delta \sigma}.&lt;/math&gt;
* If ''i'' is a limit ordinal, set
*:&lt;math&gt; G^i = \bigcup_{j &lt; i} G^j. &lt;/math&gt;

The claim is that the Borel algebra is ''G''&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, where ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[first uncountable ordinal|first uncountable ordinal number]]. That is, the Borel algebra can be ''generated'' from the class of open sets by iterating the operation

:&lt;math&gt; G \mapsto G_{\delta \sigma}. &lt;/math&gt;

to the first uncountable ordinal.

To prove this claim, note that any open set in a metric space is the union of an increasing sequence of closed sets. In particular, complementation of sets maps ''G&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' into itself for any limit ordinal  ''m''; moreover if ''m'' is an uncountable limit ordinal, ''G&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' is closed under countable unions.

Note that for each Borel set ''B'', there is some countable ordinal &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''B'' can be obtained by iterating the operation over &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;. However, as ''B'' varies over all Borel sets, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; will vary over all the countable ordinals, and thus the first ordinal at which all the Borel sets are obtained is &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the first uncountable ordinal.

=== Example ===
An important example, especially in the [[probability theory|theory of probability]], is the Borel algebra on the set of [[real number]]s. It is the algebra on which the [[Borel measure]] is defined.  Given a real random variable defined on a [[probability space]], its  [[probability distribution]] is by definition also a measure on the Borel algebra.

The Borel algebra on the reals is the smallest σ-algebra on '''R''' which contains all the [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]].

In the construction by transfinite induction, it can be shown that, in each step, the [[cardinality|number]] of sets is, at most, the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. So, the total number of Borel sets is less than or equal to
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_1 \cdot 2 ^ {\aleph_0}\, = 2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

In fact, the cardinality of the collection of Borel sets is equal to that of the continuum (compare to the number of Lebesgue measurable sets that exist, which is strictly larger and equal to &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{\aleph_0}}&lt;/math&gt;).

== Standard Borel spaces and Kuratowski theorems ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] --&gt;
{{see also|Standard Borel space}}

Let ''X'' be a topological space. The '''Borel space''' associated to ''X'' is the pair (''X'',''B''), where ''B'' is the σ-algebra of Borel sets of ''X''.

[[George Mackey|Mackey]] defined a Borel space somewhat differently, writing that it is "a set together with a distinguished σ-field of subsets called its Borel sets." &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Mackey| first=G.W. | title=Ergodic  Theory  and Virtual  Groups |  year=1966 | journal=Math. Ann.|volume=166|pages=187&amp;ndash;207|publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|issue=3|authorlink=George Mackey|doi=10.1007/BF01361167|issn=0025-5831|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01361167|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern usage is to call the distinguished sub-algebra ''measurable sets'' and such spaces [[measurable space|''measurable spaces'']]. The reason for this distinction is that the Borel sets are the σ-algebra generated by ''open'' sets (of a topological space), whereas Mackey's definition refers to a set equipped with an ''arbitrary'' σ-algebra. There exist measurable spaces that are not Borel spaces, for any choice of topology on the underlying space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathoverflow.net/questions/87838/is-every-sigma-algebra-the-borel-algebra-of-a-topology Jochen Wengenroth (mathoverflow.net/users/21051), Is every sigma-algebra the Borel algebra of a topology?, http://mathoverflow.net/questions/87888 (version: 2012-02-09)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurable spaces form a [[category (mathematics)|category]] in which the [[morphism]]s are [[measurable function]]s between measurable spaces. A function &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[measurable function|measurable]] if it [[pullback|pulls back]] measurable sets, i.e., for all measurable sets ''B'' in ''Y'', &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt; is a measurable set in ''X''.

'''Theorem'''.  Let ''X'' be a [[Polish space]], that is, a topological space such that there is a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] ''d'' on ''X'' which defines the topology of ''X'' and which makes ''X'' a complete [[separable space|separable]] metric space.  Then ''X'' as a Borel  space is [[isomorphic]] to one of
# '''R''', 
# '''Z''', 
# a finite space. 
(This result is reminiscent of [[Maharam's theorem]].)

Considered as Borel spaces, the real line '''R''', the union of '''R''' with a countable set, and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; are isomorphic.

A '''[[standard Borel space]]''' is the Borel space associated to a [[Polish space]]. A standard Borel space is characterized up to isomorphism by its cardinality,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Srivastava| first=S.M. | title=A Course on Borel Sets |  year=1991 | publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] | isbn=0-387-98412-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and any uncountable standard Borel space has the cardinality of the continuum.

For subsets of Polish spaces, Borel sets can be characterized as those sets which are the ranges of continuous injective maps defined on Polish spaces.  Note however, that the range of a continuous noninjective map may fail to be Borel.  See [[analytic set]].

Every [[probability measure]] on a standard Borel space turns it into a [[standard probability space]].

== Non-Borel sets ==
{{anchor|counterexample}}

An example of a subset of the reals which is non-Borel, due to [[Nikolai Luzin|Lusin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Lusin | first=Nicolas | year=1927 | title=Sur les ensembles analytiques | journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae | publisher=Institute of mathematics, Polish academy of sciences | volume=10 | pages=1–95 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; (see Sect. 62, pages 76–78), is described below. In contrast, an example of a [[non-measurable set]] cannot be exhibited, though its existence can be proved.

Every [[irrational number]] has a unique representation by an infinite [[continued fraction]]

:&lt;math&gt;x = a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + \cfrac{1}{\ddots\,}}}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is some [[integer]] and all the other numbers &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt; are ''positive'' integers. Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all irrational numbers that correspond to sequences &lt;math&gt;(a_0,a_1,\dots)&lt;/math&gt; with the following property: there exists an infinite [[subsequence]] &lt;math&gt;(a_{k_0},a_{k_1},\dots)&lt;/math&gt; such that each element is a [[divisor]] of the next element. This set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is not Borel. In fact, it is [[analytic set|analytic]], and complete in the class of analytic sets. For more details see [[descriptive set theory]] and the book by [[Alexander S. Kechris|Kechris]], especially Exercise (27.2) on page 209, Definition (22.9) on page 169, and Exercise (3.4)(ii) on page 14.

Another non-Borel set is an inverse image &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}[0]&lt;/math&gt; of an [[Parity function#Infinite parity function|infinite parity function]] &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{0, 1\}^{\omega} \to \{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;. However, this is a proof of existence (via the axiom of choice), not an explicit example.

==Alternative non-equivalent definitions==

According to [[Paul Halmos|P. Halmos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Halmos|1950|loc=page 219}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subset of a locally compact Hausdorff topological space is called a ''Borel set'' if it belongs to the smallest [[Sigma-ring|σ–ring]] containing all compact sets.

Norberg and Vervaat &lt;ref&gt;Tommy Norberg and Wim Vervaat, Capacities on non-Hausdorff spaces, in: ''Probability and Lattices'', in: CWI Tract, vol. 110, Math. Centrum Centrum Wisk. Inform., Amsterdam, 1997, pp. 133-150&lt;/ref&gt; redefine the Borel algebra of a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;–algebra generated by its open subsets and its compact [[Saturated set|saturated subset]]s. This definition is well-suited for applications in the case where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is not Hausdorff. It coincides with the usual definition if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[second countable]] or if every compact saturated subset is closed (which is the case in particular if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff).

A '''chart''' is a graphical representation of [[data]], in which "the data is represented by [[symbol]]s, such as bars in a [[bar chart]], lines in a [[line chart]], or slices in a [[pie chart]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cary Jensen, Loy Anderson (1992). ''Harvard graphics 3: the complete reference''. Osborne McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-881749-8}} p.413&lt;/ref&gt; A chart can represent [[Table (information)|tabular]] [[number|numeric]] data, [[Graph of a function|functions]] or some kinds of qualitative structure and provides different info.

The term "chart" as a graphical representation of [[data]] has multiple meanings:
* A data chart is a type of [[diagram]] or [[Graph of a function|graph]], that organizes and represents a set of numerical or qualitative data.
* [[Map]]s that are adorned with extra information ([[map surround]]) for a specific purpose are often known as charts, such as a [[nautical chart]] or [[aeronautical chart]], typically spread over several [[map sheet]]s.
* Other domain specific constructs are sometimes called charts, such as the [[chord chart]] in music notation or a [[record chart]] for album popularity.

Charts are often used to ease understanding of large quantities of data and the relationships between parts of the data. Charts can usually be read more quickly than the raw data. They are used in a wide variety of fields, and can be created by hand (often on [[graph paper]]) or by computer using a [[charting application]]. Certain types of charts are more useful for presenting a given data set than others. For example, data that presents [[percentage]]s in different groups (such as "satisfied, not satisfied, unsure") are often displayed in a [[pie chart]], but may be more easily understood when presented in a horizontal [[bar chart]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Wainer]] (1997) 'Visual revelations: graphical tales of fate and deception from Napoleon Bonaparte to Ross Perot'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8058-3878-3}} p.87-90&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, data that represents numbers that change over a period of time (such as "annual revenue from 1990 to 2000") might be best shown as a [[line chart]].

== Features of a chart ==
A chart can take a large variety of forms, however there are common features that provide the chart with its ability to extract meaning from data.

Typically the data in a chart is represented graphically, since humans are generally able to infer meaning from pictures quicker than from text. Text is generally used only to annotate the data.

One of the most important uses of text in a graph is the '''title'''. A graph's title usually appears above the main graphic and provides a succinct description of what the data in the graph refers to.

Dimensions in the data are often displayed on '''[[X axis|axes]]'''. If a horizontal and a vertical axis are used, they are usually referred to as the x-axis and y-axis respectively. Each axis will have a '''scale''', denoted by periodic graduations and usually accompanied by numerical or categorical indications. Each axis will typically also have a label displayed outside or beside it, briefly describing the dimension represented. If the scale is numerical, the label will often be suffixed with the unit of that scale in parentheses. For example, "Distance traveled (m)" is a typical x-axis label and would mean that the distance traveled, in units of meters, is related to the horizontal position of the data within the chart.

Within the graph a '''grid''' of lines may appear to aid in the visual alignment of data. The grid can be enhanced by visually emphasizing the lines at regular or significant graduations. The emphasized lines are then called major grid lines and the remainder are minor grid lines.

The data of a chart can appear in all manner of formats, and may include individual textual '''labels''' describing the datum associated with the indicated position in the chart. The data may appear as dots or shapes, connected or unconnected, and in any combination of colors and patterns. Inferences or points of interest can be overlaid directly on the graph to further aid information extraction.

When the data appearing in a chart contains multiple variables, the chart may include a '''legend''' (also known as a '''key'''). A legend contains a list of the variables appearing in the chart and an example of their appearance. This information allows the data from each variable to be identified in the chart.

== Types of charts ==

=== Common charts ===
Four of the most common charts are:

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Black cherry tree histogram.svg|[[Histogram]]
File:Försäljningsstatistik för blanddrycker.png|[[Bar chart]]
File:ActionnariatLibe2007-fr.svg|[[Pie chart]]
File:USTrade1991-2005.png|[[Line chart]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

This gallery shows:

* A [[histogram]] consists of tabular frequencies, shown as adjacent rectangles, erected over discrete intervals (bins), with an area equal to the frequency of the observations in the interval; first introduced by Karl Pearson.&lt;ref name="pearson"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Pearson | first1 = K. |authorlink=Karl Pearson| title = Contributions to the Mathematical Theory of Evolution. II. Skew Variation in Homogeneous Material| journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences| volume = 186| pages = 343–414| year = 1895| doi = 10.1098/rsta.1895.0010|bibcode = 1895RSPTA.186..343P }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[bar chart]] is a chart with rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. The first known bar charts are usually attributed to Nicole Oresme, Joseph Priestley, and William Playfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Ever Bar Charts Created in 14th Century|url=http://www.anychart.com/blog/2015/06/02/first-bar-chart-in-history/|publisher=AnyChart|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[pie chart]] shows percentage values as a slice of a pie; first introduced by William Playfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpowered.com/graphs-and-charts/pie-chart-history.htm|title=History of Pie Charts|publisher=JPowered|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[line chart]] is a two-dimensional scatterplot of ordered observations where the observations are connected following their order. The first known line charts are usually credited to Francis Hauksbee, Nicolaus Samuel Cruquius, Johann Heinrich Lambert and William Playfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Michael Friendly]]|year=2008|url=http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf|title=Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other common charts are:

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:MLB slugging history.svg|[[Area chart]]
File:Cartlinearlarge.png|[[Cartogram]]
File:Autosomal Dominant Pedigree Chart.svg|[[Pedigree chart]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Less-common charts ===
Examples of less common charts are:

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:LastGraph example.svg|[[Streamgraph]]
File:GapChart-Top14-2013-2014.png|[[GapChart]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

This gallery shows:
* A [[bubble chart]] is a two-dimensional scatterplot where a third variable is represented by the size of the points.
* A [[Pie chart#Polar area diagram|polar area diagram]], sometimes called a Coxcomb chart, is an enhanced form of pie chart developed by [[Florence Nightingale]].
* A [[radar chart]] or "spider chart" or "doi" is a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point.
* A [[waterfall chart]] also known as a "Walk" chart, is a special type of floating-column chart.
* A [[Treemapping|tree map]] where the areas of the rectangles correspond to values.  Other dimensions can be represented with colour or hue.
* A [[streamgraph]], a stacked, curvilinear area graph displaced around a central axis
* A [[GapChart]], a time series chart showing evolving gaps and equalities between series. Other dimensions can be represented with colour or hue.

=== Field-specific charts ===
Some types of charts have specific uses in a certain field

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Bollinger bands example, 2 stddevs.png|[[Open-high-low-close chart]]
File:Candlestick-chart.png|[[Candlestick chart]]
File:KagiSample2Chart echarts.gif|[[Kagi chart]]
File:Sparkline dowjones.svg|[[Sparkline]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

This gallery shows:
* Stock market prices are often depicted with an [[open-high-low-close chart]] with a traditional bar chart of volume at the bottom.
* [[Candlestick chart]]s are another type of bar chart used to describe price movements of an equity over time.
* A [[Kagi chart]] is a time-independent stock tracking chart that attempts to minimise noise.
* Alternatively, where less detail is required, and chart size is paramount, a [[Sparkline]] may be used.

Other examples:
* Interest rates, temperatures, etc., at the close of the period are plotted with a line chart.
* Project planners use a [[Gantt chart]] to show the timing of tasks as they occur over time.

=== Well-known named charts ===
Some of the better-known named charts are:

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Gantt przyklad 2.PNG|[[Gantt chart]]
File:Nolan-chart.svg|[[Nolan chart]]
File:5n PERT graph with critical path.svg|[[PERT]] chart
File:Smith chart bmd.gif|[[Smith chart]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Some specific charts have become well known by effectively explaining a phenomenon or idea.
* An [[Allele chart]] is a chart originating from the study of [[genetics]] to show the interaction of two data points in a grid.
* A [[Gantt chart]] helps in scheduling complex projects.
* The [[Nolan chart]] and the [[Pournelle chart]] classify political philosophies according to two axes of variation.
* A [[Program Evaluation and Review Technique|PERT chart]] is often used in [[project management]].
* The [[Smith chart]] serves in [[radio electronics]].

=== Other charts ===
There are dozens of other types of charts. Here are some of them:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9299">[[File:Chernoff faces for evaluations of US judges.svg|thumb|This example shows Chernoff faces for lawyers' ratings of twelve judges]]

'''Chernoff faces''', invented by [[Herman Chernoff]] in 1973, display [[multivariate statistics|multivariate]] data in the shape of a human face. The individual parts, such as eyes, ears, mouth and nose represent values of the variables by their shape, size, placement and orientation. The idea behind using faces is that humans easily recognize faces and notice small changes without difficulty. Chernoff faces handle each variable differently. Because the features of the faces vary in perceived importance, the way in which variables are mapped to the features should be carefully chosen (e.g. eye size and [[eyebrow]]-slant have been found to carry significant weight).&lt;ref&gt;"An Experimental Analysis of the Pre-Attentiveness of Features in Chernoff Faces", Morris CJ, Ebert DS, Rheingans P. 1999; published by the conference "Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition: 3D Visualization for Data Exploration and Decision Making". http://www.research.ibm.com/people/c/cjmorris/publications/Chernoff_990402.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detail==
Chernoff faces themselves can be plotted on a standard X-Y graph; the faces can be positioned X-Y based on the two most important variables, and then the faces themselves represent the rest of the dimensions for each item. [[Edward Tufte]], presenting such a diagram, says this kind of Chernoff face graph would "reduce well, maintaining legibility even with individual areas of .05 square inches as shown...with cartoon faces and even numbers becoming data measures, we would appear to have reached the limit of graphical economy of presentation, imagination, and let it be admitted, eccentricity."&lt;ref&gt;pg 142, ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extensions==
===Asymmetrical faces===
In 1981, Bernhard Flury and Hans Riedwyl suggested '[[asymmetrical]]' Chernoff faces; since a face has vertical symmetry (around the y-axis), the left side of the face is identical to the right and is basically wasted space – a point also made by Tufte.&lt;ref&gt;"Halves may be easier to sort (by matching the right half of an unsorted face to the left half of a sorted face) than full faces. Or else an asymmetrical full face can be used to report additional variables (Flury &amp; Riedwyl 1981). Bilateral symmetry doubles the space consumed by the design in a graph, without adding new information." pg 97, ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information''&lt;/ref&gt; One could have the 18 variables that specify the left be one set of data, but use a different set of data for the right side of the face, allowing one face to depict 36 different measurements. They present results showing that such asymmetrical faces are useful in visualizing databases of [[identical twin]]s, for example, and are useful in grouping as pairs of Chernoff faces would be.

===Chernoff Fish===
In ''Visualizing Financial Data'', ({{ISBN|978-1-118-90785-6}}), Julie Rodriguez and Piotr Kaczmarek use 'Chernoff Fish' where various  parts of a cartoon fish are used to encode different financial details.

==In Literature==
In the Peter Watts novel [[Blindsight (Watts novel)|Blindsight]] a transhuman character is seen using Chernoff Faces. This is explained by the character as a more efficient method of representing data as a large portion of the human brain is devoted to facial recognition.

In the sci-fi short story [[Degrees of Freedom]] by [[Karl Schroeder]], Chernoff Faces make a prominent appearances as a future technology supporting the communication of aggregate sentiment and perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thegrid.ai/kgw/end-notes-from-karl-schroeders-degrees-of-freedom/ |title=End notes from Karl Schroeder's "Degrees of Freedom" |author=Karl Schroeder |access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], '''coherence''' can have several different meanings.

==In personal probability==
When dealing with personal probability assessments, or supposed probabilities derived in nonstandard ways, it is a property of self-consistency across a whole set of such assessments.

===In gambling strategy===
One way of expressing such self-consistency is in terms of responses to various betting propositions, as described in relation to [[coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)]].&lt;ref name=D&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Bayesian decision theory===
The '''coherency principle''' in [[Bayesian decision theory]] is the assumption that personal probabilities follow the ordinary rules for probability calculations (where the validity of these rules corresponds to the self-consistency just referred to) and thus that consistent decisions can be obtained from these probabilities.&lt;ref name=D/&gt;

==In time series analysis==

In [[time series analysis]], and particularly in [[frequency spectrum#Spectrum analysis|spectral analysis]], it is used to describe the strength of association between two series where the possible dependence between the two series is not limited to simultaneous values but may include leading, lagged and smoothed relationships.&lt;ref name=E&gt;Everitt, B.S. (2002) The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics, CUP. {{ISBN|0-521-81099-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts here are sometimes known as '''coherency'''&lt;ref name=D/&gt; and are essentially those set out for coherence as for signal processing. However, note that the quantity '''coefficient of coherence''' may sometimes be called the ''squared coherence''.&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

{{About|Devas in [[Jainism|Jainist]] teachings|other uses|Deva (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Padmavati.JPG|thumb|Idol of [[Padmavati (Jainism)|Padmāvatī]] devī, śāsanadevī of Lord [[Parshvanatha]] at Walkeshwar Temple. She is one of the most popular demi-goddesses amongst the Jains. Worship of such persons is considered as ''mithyātva'' or wrong belief and many Jains unknowingly get involved in such worship.]]
{{Jainism}}
The ''sanskrit'' word '''Deva''' has multiple meanings in Jainism. In many places the word has been used to refer to the ''[[Tirthankara]]s'' (spiritual teachers of Dharma). But in common usage it is used to refer to the heavenly beings. These beings are born instantaneously in special beds without any parents just like [[Naraka (Jainism)|hell]] beings (''naraki'').{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=28}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=110}} According to Jain texts, clairvoyance (''avadhi jnana'') based on birth is possessed by the celestial beings.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=9}}

== Classes of Heavenly beings ==

According to Jain texts, the celestial beings are of four orders (classes):{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=51}}{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=550}}-
* ''Bhavanavasi'' (residential)
* ''Vyantara'' (intermediaries or peripatetic)
* ''Joytiska'' (luminaries or stellar)
* ''Vaimanika'' (Astral or heavenly beings)

There are of ten, eight, five and twelve classes up to the Heavenly beings (''kalpavasis'').{{further explanation needed|date=April 2017}} There are ten grades in each of these classes of celestial beings, the Lord (Indra), his Equal, the Minister, the courtiers, the bodyguards, the police, the army, the citizens, the servants, and the menials.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=52}}

==Abode==
{{main|Heaven#Jainism}}
The abode of Devas is ''Svarga'' (heaven).{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=110}} According to Jain texts, persons with right faith (except those whose bondage of life-karma has been accomplished prior to their attainment of right belief) are reborn among the fourth order of ''devas'' and not among the three lower orders, namely the Residential, the Peripatetic and the Stellar ''devas''. Those practising restraint with attachment and restraint-cum-non-restraint are also characterized by right belief. Hence they are reborn in the higher heavens of ''Saudharma Kalpa'' and so on and not among the three lower orders of celestial beings.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=183}} Merit which leads to the highest celestial state such as  ''Sarvārthasiddhi'' is said to be acquired in the ''Bharata'', ''Airāvata'', and ''Videha Kshetra''{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=183}}

== Lifetime ==
1. Minimum lifetime of the Residential ''devas'' is ten thousand years.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=127}}
2. Peripatetic ''devas'' is a little over one ''palyopama''.
3.&amp;nbsp;Stellar ''devas'' same as Peripatetic ''devas''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5322">In [[mathematics]], '''duality theory for distributive lattices'''  provides three different (but closely related) representations of [[distributive lattice|bounded distributive lattices]] via [[Priestley space]]s, [[spectral space]]s, and [[pairwise Stone space]]s. This generalizes the well-known [[Stone duality]] between [[Stone space]]s and [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s.

Let {{math|''L''}} be a bounded distributive lattice, and let {{math|''X''}} denote the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[Ideal (order theory)|prime filters]] of {{math|''L''}}. For each {{math|''a'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; L}}, let {{math|''&amp;phi;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'') {{=}} {''x''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''X'' : ''a'' &amp;isin; ''x''} }}. Then {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a spectral space,&lt;ref&gt;Stone (1937), Johnstone (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[topological space#Definition|topology]] {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{math|''X''}} is generated by {{math| {''&amp;phi;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'') : ''a''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''L''}}}. The spectral space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is called the ''prime spectrum'' of {{math|''L''}}.

The [[map (mathematics)|map]] {{math|''&amp;phi;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a lattice [[isomorphism]] from {{math|''L''}} onto the lattice of all [[compact set|compact]] [[open set|open]] subsets of {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. In fact, each spectral space is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the prime spectrum of some bounded distributive lattice.&lt;ref&gt;Stone (1937), Johnstone (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, if {{math|''&amp;phi;''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;(a) {{=}} {''x''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''X'' : ''a'' &amp;notin; ''x''} }} and {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;}} denotes the topology generated by {{math|{''&amp;phi;''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'') : ''a''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''L''}}}, then {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is also a spectral space. Moreover, {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;,''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a [[pairwise Stone space]]. The pairwise Stone space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;,''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is called the ''bitopological dual'' of {{math|''L''}}. Each pairwise Stone space is [[bi-homeomorphic]] to the bitopological dual of some bounded distributive lattice.&lt;ref&gt;Bezhanishvili et al. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, let {{math|&amp;le;}} be set-theoretic inclusion on the set of prime filters of {{math|''L''}} and let {{math|''&amp;tau;'' {{=}} ''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;or;&lt;/small&gt; ''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Then {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} is a [[Priestley space]]. Moreover, {{math|''&amp;phi;''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a lattice isomorphism from {{math|''L''}} onto the lattice of all [[clopen set|clopen]] [[up-set]]s of {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}}. The Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} is called the ''Priestley dual'' of {{math|''L''}}. Each Priestley space is isomorphic to the Priestley dual of some bounded distributive lattice.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

Let '''Dist''' denote the category of bounded distributive lattices and bounded lattice [[homomorphisms]]. Then the above three representations of bounded distributive lattices can be extended to [[Equivalence of categories|dual equivalence]]&lt;ref&gt;Bezhanishvili et al. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; between '''Dist''' and the categories '''Spec''', '''PStone''', and  '''Pries''' of spectral spaces with spectral maps, of pairwise Stone spaces with bi-continuous maps, and of Priestley spaces with Priestley morphisms, respectively:

[[Image:DL Duality.png|thumb|center|alt=Spec, Pries and Pstone are isomorphic, all three are dually equivalent to Dist|Duality for bounded distributive lattices]]

Thus, there are three equivalent ways of representing bounded distributive lattices. Each one has its own motivation and advantages, but ultimately they all serve the same purpose of providing better understanding of bounded distributive lattices.

The '''extended evolutionary synthesis''' consists of a set of theoretical concepts more comprehensive than the earlier [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of [[evolutionary biology]] that took place between 1918 and 1942. The extended evolutionary synthesis was called for in the 1950s by [[C. H. Waddington]], argued for on the basis of [[punctuated equilibrium]] by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] in the 1980s, and was reconceptualized in 2007 by [[Massimo Pigliucci]] and [[Gerd B. Müller]].

The extended evolutionary synthesis revisits the relative importance of different factors at play, examining several assumptions of the earlier synthesis, and augmenting it with additional causative factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wade | first1=Michael J | year=2011 | title=The Neo-Modern Synthesis: The Confluence of New Data and Explanatory Concepts | url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/5/407.full | journal=BioScience | volume=61 | pages=407–408 | doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.5.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smee 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laland|first=Kevin N.|last2=Uller|first2=Tobias|last3=Feldman|first3=Marcus W.|last4=Sterelny|first4=Kim|last5=Müller|first5=Gerd B.|last6=Moczek|first6=Armin|last7=Jablonka|first7=Eva|last8=Odling-Smee|first8=John|date=2015-08-22|title=The extended evolutionary synthesis: its structure, assumptions and predictions|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1813/20151019|journal=Proc.

Not all biologists have agreed on the need for, or the scope of, an extended synthesis. Many have collaborated on another synthesis in [[evolutionary developmental biology]], which concetrates on developmental [[molecular genetics]] and [[evolution]] to understand how [[natural selection]] operated on developmental processes and [[deep homology|deep homologies]] between organisms at the level of [[conserved sequence|highly conserved genes]].

==The preceding "modern synthesis"==
[[File:Modern Synthesis.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Several major ideas about [[evolution]] came together in the [[population genetics]] of the early 20th century to form the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], including [[genetic variation]], [[natural selection]], and particulate ([[Mendelian genetics|Mendelian]]) inheritance. This ended the [[eclipse of Darwinism]] and supplanted a variety of [[alternatives to Darwinism|non-Darwinian theories of evolution]]. However, it did not unify all of biology, omitting sciences such as [[developmental biology]].]]
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}

The modern synthesis was the widely accepted early-20th-century synthesis reconciling [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution by [[natural selection]] and [[Gregor Mendel]]'s theory of [[Mendelian genetics|genetics]] in a joint mathematical framework. It established [[evolution]] as [[biology]]'s central [[paradigm#Scientific paradigm|paradigm]]. The 19th-century ideas of [[natural selection]] by Darwin and [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]] were united by researchers who included [[Ronald Fisher]], one of the three founders of [[population genetics]], and [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Sewall Wright]], between 1918 and 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=National Academy of Sciences |authorlink=National Academy of Sciences |year=1999 |title=Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024 |edition= 2nd |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Academy Press |isbn=0-309-06406-6 |lccn=99006259 |oclc=43803228 |page=28 |quote=The scientific consensus around evolution is overwhelming.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bock |first=Walter J. |date=July 1981 |title=Reviewed Work: ''The Evolutionary Synthesis.

==Early history==

During the 1950s, the English biologist [[C. H. Waddington]] called for an extended synthesis based on his research on [[epigenetics]] and [[genetic assimilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wilkins | first1=Adam S | year=2008 | title=Waddington's Unfinished Critique of Neo-Darwinian Genetics: Then and Now | url=| journal=Biological Theory | volume=3 | issue=3| pages=224–232 | doi=10.1162/biot.2008.3.3.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pigliucci | first1=Massimo | authorlink=Massimo Pigliucci | display-authors=1 | last2=et al | year=2006 | title=Phenotypic plasticity and evolution by genetic assimilation | url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/12/2362.full | journal=Journal of Experimental Biology | volume=209 | issue=| pages=2362–2367 | doi=10.1242/jeb.02070}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huang S. (2011). ''The molecular and mathematical basis of Waddington’s epigenetic landscape: A framework for post-Darwinian biology?'' BioEssays 34: 149-157.&lt;/ref&gt; An extended synthesis was also proposed by the Austrian zoologist [[Rupert Riedl]], with the study of [[evolvability]].&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Günter P; Laubichler; Manfred D. (2004). [http://www.yale.edu/gpwagner/pdfs/Riedl2004.pdf "Rupert Riedl and the Re-Synthesis of Evolutionary and Developmental Biology: Body Plans and Evolvability"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208094623/http://www.yale.edu/gpwagner/pdfs/Riedl2004.pdf |date=2015-12-08 }}. ''[[Journal of Experimental Zoology]]'' (Mol Dev Evol) 302B: 92-102.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, [[Michael J. D. White]] wrote about an extension of the modern synthesis based on new research from [[speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;Parnell, Dennis R. (1978). ''Heralding a New Synthesis Modes of Speciation by M. J. D. White''. Systematic Botany. Vol. 3, No. 1. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s: punctuated equilibrium==

In the 1980s, the American palaeontologists [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] argued for an extended synthesis based on their idea of [[punctuated equilibrium]], the role of species selection shaping large scale evolutionary patterns and [[natural selection]] working on multiple levels extending from genes to species.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay.

{{main|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

Some researchers in the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] proposed another synthesis. They argue that the modern and extended syntheses should mostly center on [[gene]]s and suggest an integration of [[embryology]] with [[molecular genetics]] an [[evolution]], aiming to understand how [[natural selection]] operates on [[Regulation of gene expression|gene regulation]] and [[Deep homology|deep homologies]] between organisms at the level of [[Conserved sequence|highly conserved genes]], [[transcription factor]]s and [[signalling pathways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61756485|title=The regulatory genome : gene regulatory networks in development and evolution|last=1937-2015,|first=Davidson, Eric H.,|isbn=0120885638|location=Amsterdam [Netherlands]|oclc=61756485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laubichler 2015" /&gt; By contrast, a different strand of evo-devo following an organismal approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bateson | first1=P | year=2005 | title=The Return of the Whole Organism | url=| journal=Journal of Biosciences | volume=30 | issue=| pages=31–39 | doi=10.1007/bf02705148 | pmid=15824439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Huneman | first1=Philippe | year=2010 | title=Assessing the Prospects for a Return of Organisms in Evolutionary Biology | url=| journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences | volume=32 | pages=341–372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gilbert | first1=S.F. | last2=Opitz | first2=G. | last3=Raff | first3=R. | year=1996 | title=Resynthesizing Evolutionary and Developmental Biology | url=| journal=Development and Evolution | volume=173 | issue=| pages=357–372 | doi=10.1006/dbio.1996.0032 | pmid=8605997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Müller | first1=G.

The extended synthesis is characterized by its additional set of predictions that differ from the standard modern synthesis theory:

===Testing===

The extended evolutionary synthesis is currently being tested by a group of scientists from eight institutions in Britain, Sweden and the United States. The £7.7 million project is supported by a £5.7 million grant from the [[John Templeton Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=|first1=|title=Should Evolutionary Theory Evolve|url=https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2016/04/evolution-templeton-grant.page|website=University of Southampton|date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Laland|first1=Kevin|title=Launching the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis project|url=https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/users/24915-kevin-laland/posts/14200-launching-the-extended-evolutionary-synthesis-project|website=Nature Research Ecology &amp; Evolution Community|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is headed by [[Kevin Laland|Kevin N. Laland]] at the [[University of St Andrews]] and Tobias Uller at [[Lund University]]. According to Laland what the extended synthesis "really boils down to is recognition that, in addition to selection, drift, mutation and other established evolutionary processes, other factors, particularly developmental influences, shape the evolutionary process in important ways."&lt;ref&gt;[https://evolution-institute.org/empowering-the-extended-evolutionary-synthesis/ "Empowering the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis"].

==Status==
Biologists disagree on the need for an extended synthesis. Opponents contend that the modern synthesis is able to fully account for the newer observations, whereas others criticize that the Extended synthesis is not radical enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Craig|first=Lindsay R.|date=2010-06|title=The So-Called Extended Synthesis and Population Genetics|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1162/BIOT_a_00035|journal=Biological Theory|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=117–123|doi=10.1162/biot_a_00035|issn=1555-5542}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents think that the conceptions of evolution at the core of the modern synthesis are too narrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Laland, Kevin, Tobias Uller, Marc Feldman, Kim Sterelny, Gerd B.

For example, [[Denis Noble]] says that using terms and categories of the modern synthesis distort the picture of biology that modern experimentation has discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noble|first1=Denis |authorlink=Denis Noble |title=Evolution Beyond Neo-Darwinism: A New Conceptual Framework|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|date=1 January 2015|volume=218|issue=Pt 1|pages=7–13|doi=10.1242/jeb.106310|pmid=25568446 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/1/7.long|pmc=4436573}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents therefore claim that the extended synthesis is necessary to help expand the conceptions and framework of how evolution is considered throughout the biological disciplines.&lt;ref name="Smee 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Müller|first=Gerd B.|date=2017-10-06|title=Why an extended evolutionary synthesis is necessary|url=http://rsfs.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/7/5/20170015|journal=Interface Focus|language=en|volume=7|issue=5|pages=20170015|doi=10.1098/rsfs.2017.0015|issn=2042-8898|pmc=5566817|pmid=28839929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coudée-turin detail.jpg|thumb|250px|Detail of a [[cubit]] rod in the [[Museo Egizio]] of [[Turin]]]]
The earliest recorded systems of weights and measures originate in the 3rd or 4th millennium BC. Even the very earliest civilizations needed measurement for purposes of agriculture, construction, and trade. Early standard units might only have applied to a single community or small region, with every area developing its own standards for lengths, areas, volumes and masses. Often such systems were closely tied to one field of use, so that volume measures used, for example, for dry grains were unrelated to those for liquids, with neither bearing any particular relationship to units of length used for measuring cloth or land. With development of manufacturing technologies, and the growing importance of trade between communities and ultimately across the Earth, standardized weights and measures became critical. Starting in the 18th century, modernized, simplified and uniform systems of weights and measures were developed, with the fundamental units defined by ever more precise methods in the science of [[metrology]]. The discovery and application of [[electricity]] was one factor motivating the development of standardized internationally applicable units. 

==Sources of information==

[[Weights and measures]] have taken a great variety of forms over the course of history, from simple informal expectations in barter transactions to elaborate state and supranational systems that integrate measures of many different kinds.  Weights and measures from the oldest societies can often be inferred at least in part from [[archaeology|archaeological specimens]], often preserved in museums.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The comparison of the dimensions of buildings with the descriptions of contemporary writers is another source of information. An interesting example of this is the comparison of the dimensions of the Greek [[Parthenon]] with the description given by [[Plutarch]] from which a fairly accurate idea of the size of the [[Ancient Greek units of measurement#Length|Attic foot]] is obtained. Because of the comparative volume of artifacts and documentation, we know much more about the state-sanctioned measures of large, advanced societies than we do about those of smaller societies or about the informal measures that often coexisted with official ones throughout history. In some cases, we have only plausible theories and we must sometimes select the interpretation to be given to the evidence.

By studying the evidence given by all available sources, and by correlating the relevant facts, we obtain some idea of the origin and development of the units. We find that they have changed more or less gradually with the passing of time in a complex manner because of a great variety of modifying influences.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} It is possible to group official measurement systems for large societies into historical systems that are relatively stable over time, including: the Babylonian system, the Egyptian system, the Phileterian system of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] age, the Olympic system of Greece, the Roman system, the [[English unit|British system]], and the [[metric system]].

==Earliest known systems==
The earliest known uniform systems of weights and measures seem all to have been created at some time in the [[4th millennium BC|4th]] and [[3rd millennium BC|3rd millennia BC]] among the ancient peoples of [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus Valley]], and perhaps also [[Elam]] (in [[Iran]]) as well.

Early [[Babylonia]]n and [[History of Egypt|Egyptian]] records and the [[Hebrew Bible]] indicate that length was first measured with the forearm, hand, or finger and that time was measured by the periods of the sun, moon, and other heavenly bodies. When it was necessary to compare the capacities of containers such as [[gourd]]s or [[clay]] or metal vessels, they were filled with plant seeds which were then counted to measure the [[volume]]s. When means for weighing were invented, seeds and stones served as standards. For instance, the [[Carat (unit)|carat]], still used as a unit for gems, was derived from the [[carob]] seed.

==History of units==
{{main|Historical metrology}}

=== Units of length ===
The Egyptian [[cubit]], the [[Indus Valley]] units of length referred to above and the Mesopotamian cubit were used in the 3rd millennium BC and are the earliest known units used by ancient peoples to measure length. The units of length used in ancient India included the dhanus, or dhanush (bow), the krosa (cry, or cow-call) and the [[yojana]] (stage).

The common cubit was the length of the forearm from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. It was divided into the span of the hand or the length between the tip of little finger to the tip of the thumb (one-half cubit), the palm or width of the hand (one sixth), and the digit or width of the middle finger (one twenty-fourth).  The Royal Cubit, which was a standard cubit enhanced by an extra palm—thus 7 palms or 28 digits long—was used in constructing buildings and monuments and in surveying in ancient Egypt.  The [[inch]], [[foot (length)|foot]], and [[yard]] evolved from these units through a complicated transformation not yet fully understood. Some believe they evolved from cubic measures; others believe they were simple proportions or multiples of the cubit. In whichever case, the Greeks and Romans inherited the foot from the Egyptians. The Roman foot (~296&amp;nbsp;mm) was divided into both 12 ''unciae'' (inches) (~24.7&amp;nbsp;mm) and 16 digits (~18.5&amp;nbsp;mm). The Romans also introduced the ''mille passus'' (1000 paces) or double steps, the pace being equal to five Roman feet (~1480&amp;nbsp;mm). The Roman [[mile]] of 5000 feet (1480 m) was introduced into England during the occupation. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] (reigned from 1558 to 1603) changed, by statute, the mile to 5280 feet (~1609 m) or 8 furlongs, a [[furlong]] being 40 [[rod (unit)]]s (~201 m) of 5.5 yards (~5.03 m) each.

The introduction of the yard (0.9144 m) as a unit of length came later, but its origin is not definitely known. Some believe the origin was the double cubit, others believe that it originated from cubic measure. Whatever its origin, the early yard was divided by the binary method into 2, 4, 8, and 16 parts called the half-yard, span, finger, and nail. The association of the yard with the "gird" or circumference of a person's waist or with the distance from the tip of the nose to the end of the thumb of [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (reigned 1100–1135) are probably standardizing actions, since several yards were in use in Britain.
There were also Rods, Poles and Perches for measurements of length. The following table lists the equivalents.

=== Units of mass ===
The [[Grain (mass)|grain]] was the earliest [[Mass#Units of mass|unit of mass]] and is the smallest unit in the [[Apothecarie' system of mass|apothecary]], [[avoirdupois]], Tower, and [[Troy weight|troy]] systems. The early unit was a grain of wheat or barleycorn used to weigh the precious metals silver and gold. Larger units preserved in stone standards were developed that were used as both units of mass and of monetary currency. The [[Pound (mass)|pound]] was derived from the mina used by ancient civilizations.  A smaller unit was the shekel, and a larger unit was the [[talent (measurement)|talent]]. The magnitude of these units varied from place to place. The Babylonians and Sumerians had a system in which there were 60 shekels in a mina and 60 minas in a talent. The Roman talent consisted of 100 libra (pound) which were smaller in magnitude than the mina. The troy pound (~373.2 g) used in England and the United States for monetary purposes, like the Roman pound, was divided into 12 ounces, but the Roman uncia (ounce) was smaller. The carat is a unit for measuring gemstones that had its origin in the carob seed, which later was standardized at 1/144 ounce and then 0.2&amp;nbsp;gram. 

Goods of commerce were originally traded by number or volume.  When weighing of goods began, units of mass based on a volume of grain or water were developed. The diverse magnitudes of units having the same name, which still appear today in our dry and liquid measures, could have arisen from the various commodities traded.  The larger avoirdupois pound for goods of commerce might have been based on volume of water which has a higher [[bulk density]] than grain.

The stone, quarter, hundredweight, and ton were larger units of mass used in Britain.  Today only the stone continues in customary use for measuring personal body weight.  The present stone is 14 pounds (~6.35&amp;nbsp;kg), but an earlier unit appears to have been 16 pounds (~7.25&amp;nbsp;kg).  The other units were multiples of 2, 8, and 160 times the stone, or 28, 112, and 2240 pounds (~12.7&amp;nbsp;kg, 50.8&amp;nbsp;kg, 1016&amp;nbsp;kg), respectively.  The hundredweight was approximately equal to two talents.  The ton of 2240 pounds is called the "long ton".  The "short ton" is equal to 2000 pounds (~907&amp;nbsp;kg).  A tonne (t) is equal to 1000&amp;nbsp;kg.

=== Units of time and angle ===
The division of the circle into 360 degrees and the day into hours, minutes, and seconds can be traced to the Babylonians who had [[sexagesimal]] system of numbers.  The 360 degrees may have been related to a [[360-day calendar|year of 360 days]].  Many other [[systems of measurement]] divided the day differently -- [[Hour#Counting hours|counting hours]], [[decimal time]], etc. Other [[calendar]]s divided the year differently.

== Forerunners of the metric system ==
Decimal numbers are an essential part of the metric system, with only one base unit and multiples created on the decimal base, the figures remain the same. This simplifies calculations. Although the [[India|Indians]] used decimal numbers for mathematical computations, it was [[Simon Stevin]] who in 1585 first advocated the use of decimal numbers for everyday purposes in his booklet ''De Thiende'' (old Dutch for 'the tenth').  He also declared that it would only be a matter of time before decimal numbers were used for currencies and measurements. [[Simon Stevin#Decimal fractions|His notation]] for decimal fractions was clumsy, but this was overcome with the introduction of the decimal point, generally attributed to [[Bartholomaeus Pitiscus]] who used this notation in his trigonometrical tables (1595).&lt;ref name="Stevin_MacTutor2"&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Stevin|date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|''Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language'']], published in 1668, [[John Wilkins]] proposed a system of measurement that was very similar in concept to today's metric system.  He proposed retaining the second as the basic unit of time and proposed that the length of a pendulum which crossed the zero position once a second (i.e. had a period of two seconds) should be the base unit of length.  This length, for which he proposed the name "standard", would have been 994&amp;nbsp;mm.  His base unit of mass, which he proposed calling a "hundred", would have been the mass of a cubic standard of distilled rainwater.  The names that he proposed for decimal multiples and subunits of his base units of measure were the names of units of measure that were in use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduction (33&amp;nbsp;MB):{{cite book|url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationLong.pdf|title=An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|author=[[John Wilkins]]|publisher=The Royal Society|year=1668|pages=190–194|chapter=VII|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationShort.pdf|title=An ESSAY Towards a REAL CHARACTER, And a PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE|publisher=Metricationmatters.com|format=PDF|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1670, [[Gabriel Mouton]] published a proposal that was in essence similar to Wilkins' proposal, except that his base unit of length would have been 1/1000 of a [[minute of arc]] (about 1.852&amp;nbsp;m) of geographical latitude.  He proposed calling this unit the virga.  Rather than using different names for each unit of length, he proposed a series of names that had prefixes, rather like the prefixes found in SI.&lt;ref name="Mouton2"&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Mouton|date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, [[Thomas Jefferson]] submitted a [[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States|report]] to the [[United States Congress]] in which he proposed the adoption of a decimal system of coinage and of weights and measures.  He proposed calling his base unit of length a "foot" which he suggested should be either {{frac|3|10}} or {{frac|1|3}} of the length of a pendulum that had a period of one second – that is {{frac|3|10}} or {{frac|1|3}} of the "standard" proposed by Wilkins over a century previously.  This would have equated to 11.755 English inches (29.8&amp;nbsp;cm) or 13.06 English inches (33.1&amp;nbsp;cm). Like Wilkins, the names that he proposed for multiples and subunits of his base units of measure were the names of units of measure that were in use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/jeffplan.asp|title=Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States Communicated to the House of Representatives, July 13, 1790|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|date=4 July 1790|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great interest in [[geodesy]] during this era, and the measurement system ideas that developed, influenced how the continental US was [[Surveying|surveyed]] and parceled. The story of how Jefferson's full vision for the new measurement system came close to displacing the [[Chain (unit)|Gunter chain]] and the traditional [[acre]], but ended up not doing so, is explored in [[Andro Linklater]]'s ''Measuring America''.&lt;ref name="Linklater_20022"&gt;{{cite book|title=Measuring America: How an Untamed Wilderness Shaped the United States and Fulfilled the Promise of Democracy|last=Linklater|first=Andro|publisher=Walker &amp; Co|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8027-1396-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metric conversion ==
{{Main article|Metrication|History of the metric system}}
The [[metric system]] was first described in 1668 and officially adopted by France in 1799.  Over nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it became the dominant system worldwide, although several countries, including the United States and China, continue to use their customary units. Among the numerous customary systems, many have been adapted to become an integer multiple of a related metric unit: The [[Scandinavian mile]] is now defined as 10&amp;nbsp;km, the [[Chinese jin]] is now defined as 0.5&amp;nbsp;kg, and the [[Dutch units of measurement|Dutch ons]] is now defined as 100&amp;nbsp;g. The [[US customary units|American system]] is unusual in that its units have not been adapted in such a manner.

[[File:Angels Dancing (4804258345).jpg|thumb|Dancing angels]]
The question "'''How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?'''" (alternatively   ''"How many [[angel]]s can stand on the ''point'' of a [[pin]]?"''&lt;ref name=Bartleby/&gt;) is a [[reductio ad absurdum]] of medieval [[scholasticism]] in general, and its [[angelology]] in particular, as represented by  figures such as [[Duns Scotus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name="Summa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, D.

It is first recorded in the 17th century, in the context of [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] apologetics.
The question has also been linked to the [[fall of Constantinople]], with the [[imagery]] of scholars debating about [[minutiae]] while the Turks besieged the city.&lt;ref name=TodaysZaman&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213014807/http://www.todayszaman.com/op-ed_how-many-angels-can-dance-on-the-head-of-a-pin-by-mouhanad-halwani-_270236.html|archive-date=2014-12-13|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/op-ed_how-many-angels-can-dance-on-the-head-of-a-pin-by-mouhanad-halwani-_270236.html|title=How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?|publisher=Today's Zaman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ramirez&gt;{{Cite book|title = Las Andanzas Del Diablo: Confidencias de un Abogado Ingenuo|last = Ramírez|first = José A.|publisher = Editorial Planeta|year = 1975|isbn = 9788432053375|location = |pages = 58|url = https://books.google.com/?id=oHQnr2oRRocC&amp;q=%22sexo+de+los+angeles%22+alfiler&amp;dq=%22sexo+de+los+angeles%22+alfiler&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=29e_VKfnHMvLygOFp4CwCg&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Aquinas's ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', written c. 1270, includes discussion of several questions regarding angels such as, "Can several angels be in the same place?"&lt;ref name="Summa"&gt;{{Citation | title = Summa | publisher = New advent | url = http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1052.htm#article3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  
However the idea that such questions had a prominent place in medieval scholarship has been debated, and it has not been proved that this particular question was ever disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Asselt|first= Willem J | author-link = Willem van Asselt |title= Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism | year= 2011|page= 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One theory is that it is an [[early modern]] fabrication,{{Efn | More precisely, in play in the 17th century, and discussed at various levels by the [[Cambridge Platonists]] Cudworth and [[Henry More]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].}} as used to discredit scholastic philosophy at a time when it still played a significant role in university education. [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]] has raised the scholarly issue, and mentions that there is a 17th-century reference in [[William Chillingworth]]'s ''Religion of Protestants'' (1637),&lt;ref&gt;Franklin 1993 p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; where he accuses unnamed scholastics of debating "whether a Million of Angels may not fit upon a Needle's point?&lt;!--original capitalization; see MOS:QUOTE--&gt;"
This is earlier than a reference in the 1678 ''The True Intellectual System Of The Universe'' by [[Ralph Cudworth]]. HS Lang, author of ''Aristotle's Physics and its Medieval Varieties'' (1992), says (p.&amp;nbsp;284):

{{quote|The question of how many angels can dance on the point of a [[Sewing needle|needle]], or the head of a pin, is often attributed to 'late medieval writers'...  In point of fact, the question has never been found in this form…}}

[[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]] (2016) has suggested that the first reference to angels dancing on a needle's point occurs in an expository work by the English divine, William Sclater (1575-1626). 
In ''An exposition with notes vpon the first Epistle to the Thessalonians'' (1619), Sclater claimed that scholastic philosophers occupied themselves with such pointless questions as whether angels "did occupie a place; and so, whether many might be in one place at one time; and how many might sit on a Needles point; and six hundred such like needlesse points." 
Harrison proposes that the reason an English writer first introduced the "needle’s point" into a critique of medieval angelology is that it makes for a clever pun on "needless point".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]], [http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/content/63/1/45.full.pdf+html "Angels on Pinheads and Needles’ Points"], ''Notes and Queries'', 63 (2016), 45-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter written to ''[[The Times]]'' in 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sylla |first1=E. D. |year=2005 |chapter=Swester Katrei and Gregory of Rimini: Angels, God, and Mathematics in the Fourteenth Century |editor1-last=Koetsier |editor1-first=S. |editor2-last=Bergmans |title=Mathematics and the Divine: A Historical Study |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AMOQZfrZq-EC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=%22heaven+a+thousand+angels+can+stand%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv-eLW_ffXAhWBYlAKHewrBasQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22heaven%20a%20thousand%20angels%20can%20stand%22&amp;f=false |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |page=251 |isbn=0444503285 |access-date=7 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; identified a close parallel in a 14th-century [[mystical]] text, the ''[[Swester Katrei]]'':

{{quote|[D]octors declare that in heaven a thousand angels can stand on the point of a needle.  Now [[wikt:rede#Verb|rede]] me the meaning of this.}}

Other possibilities are that it is a surviving parody or self-parody, or a training topic in debating.

In Italian,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dizionari.corriere.it/dizionario-modi-di-dire/A/angelo.shtml|title=Angelo - Dizionario dei modi di dire - Corriere.it|website=dizionari.corriere.it|language=it|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish and Portuguese, the conundrum of useless scholarly debates is linked to a similar question of [[Sexuality in Christian demonology|whether angels are sexless or have a sex]].&lt;ref name=Ramirez/&gt; 
Spanish [[jurist]] [[José Antonio Ramírez López]] (1908–1987) said about the story of the Byzantine empire: ''"Everybody knows the idiotic and sometimes bloody discussions in that Empire on the sex of angels, about how many could perch at the same time on the head of a pin"''.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==Modern references==
[[Dorothy L. Sayers]] argued that the question was "simply a debating exercise" and that the answer "usually adjudged correct" was stated as, "Angels are pure intelligences, not material, but limited, so that they have location in space, but not extension."&lt;ref name="DSLTL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gbt.org/text/sayers.html |title=The Lost Tools of Learning |first=Dorothy L |last=Sayers |authorlink=Dorothy L. Sayers|publisher=Gbt.org|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sayers compares the question to that of how many people's thoughts can be concentrated upon a particular pin at the same time. She concludes that [[infinitely]] many angels can be located on the head of a pin, since they do not occupy any space there:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The practical lesson to be drawn from the argument is not to use words like "there" in a loose, unscientific way, without specifying whether you mean "located there" or "occupying space there."&lt;ref name="DSLTL" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the humoristic magazine ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'', [[Anders Sandberg]] has presented a calculation based on theories of [[information physics]] and [[quantum gravity]], establishing an upper bound of 8.6766×10&lt;sup&gt;49&lt;/sup&gt; angels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume7/v7i3/angels-7-3.htm |title=Quantum Gravity Treatment of the Angel Density Problem|publisher=Annals of Improbable Research |date=2001 |accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Comparing medieval superstition and modern science, [[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote in the introduction to the play ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' that "The medieval doctors of divinity who did not pretend to settle how many angels could dance on the point of a needle cut a very poor figure as far as romantic credulity is concerned beside the modern physicists who have settled to the billionth of a millimetre every movement and position in the dance of the electrons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200811h.html |title= Saint Joan – A Chronicle Play in Six Scenes and an Epilogue |date= |accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the satirical novel ''[[Good Omens]]'' by [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Terry Pratchett]], the angel Aziraphale is said to be the only angel who could dance on the head of a pin, as he learned the [[gavotte]] in the 19th century. Also, in ''[[Carpe Jugulum]]'' by Terry Pratchett, Granny Weatherwax says the answer is 16 if it's an ordinary house pin.

''Weather Report Suite Part II: Let It Grow'', a song from the 1973 [[Grateful Dead]] album [[Wake of the Flood]], includes the line "As well to count the angels dancing on a pin."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dead.net/song/weather-report-suite-part-ii-let-it-grow&lt;/ref&gt;

In the comic book ''[[The Crow]]'' by [[James O'Barr]], the main character asks this question to one of his victims before killing them, answering himself, "Depends on the tune".

The song ''Velodrome'' from [[Minnesota]] rapper [[Dessa]]'s 2018 album [[Chime (Dessa album)|Chime]], references this question in the first verse asking, "Aquinas, call on me/ How many angels on the/ Head of your pin?"
&lt;!--{{trivia}}
In his novel ''[[Jitterbug Perfume]]'', [[Tom Robbins]] suggests: "Philosophers have argued for centuries about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, but materialists have known all along that it depends on whether they are jitterbugging or dancing cheek to cheek".

The comic ''[[Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal]]'' poses an answer derived from physics to this question, i.e. between one and 30 [[vigintillion]] angels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=2576 |title=Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal |publisher=Smbc-comics.com |date= |accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comic [[Dilbert]] lets the character [[Dogbert]] share the final answer. It's six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dilbert.com/strip/1991-06-18|title=Dilbert Comic Strip on 1991-06-18 {{!}} Dilbert by Scott Adams|website=Dilbert|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventh episode of the fifth season of the science-fiction series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', the recurring character Byron Gordon, in a conversation about a rebellion among Human Telepaths against a despotic government, both asked and answered the question with a confident but cryptic: "As many as want to." Thus suggesting the specific number of angels is irrelevant, it is the existence of angels (and by way of analogy the Telepaths and allies that follow of the message of freedom and peace against tyranny) that is important.

'''Howard W. Dixon''' (August 4, 1915 – July 30, 2007) was a civil rights [[Lawyer|attorney]] in [[Miami]] between 1955 and 1997. During that time, he was considered an activist for the rights of poor people and minorities. He served as General Counsel for the [[NAACP]] in the ‘50s, was a founding Board Member of the [[Florida Civil Liberties Union]]. He was the founding executive director of Legal Service of Greater Miami, a program that grew out of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]’s 1964 War on Poverty. He served as Executive Director from 1966 to 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Ovalle, David. "Enduring legacy of civil rights." Miami Herald. August 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement as a General Master for the Florida Court System in 1987, he served as a full-time volunteer for the Legal Aid Society of Greater Miami, earning him the John Minor Wisdom Public Service and Professionalism Award for Pro Bono Service by the American Bar Association in 1995.

As Executive Director for Legal Services of Greater Miami, led several U.S. Supreme Court victories, including Agrersinger vs. Hamlin and Fuentes vs. Shevin in 1972. The cases allowed for people to have counsel and hearings in specific situations. In 1990, Dixon was awarded the Florida Supreme Court’s highest honor, the Tobias Simon Pro Bono Award.&lt;ref&gt;Elinor J. Brecher. "Activist for the rights of poor people." Miami Herald.

In 1961, as an attorney for the Florida Civil Liberties Union, Dixon defended the [[Freedom Riders]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida]]. He established legal precedence in the case regarding emergency appeals from the State to the Federal courts. The case became famous in legal circles at that time as a method to remove lawsuits from state to federal jurisdiction when all state remedies have not been exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;Florence Morgenroth.

The term is explained in [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]]'s book ''The Body in the Mind''; in case study 2 of [[George Lakoff]]'s ''Women, Fire and Dangerous Things''; by [[Rudolf Arnheim]] in ''Visual Thinking''; and more recently, by [[Tim Rohrer]]'s 2006 book chapter ''Image Schemata in the Brain''.

In contemporary [[cognitive linguistics]], an image schema is considered an embodied prelinguistic structure of experience that motivates [[conceptual metaphor]] mappings. Evidence for image schemas (also called ''image schemata'') is drawn from a number of related disciplines, including work on cross-modal cognition in [[psychology]], from spatial cognition in both [[linguistics]] and psychology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Johnson: From image schemas to abstract reasoning via metaphor==
[[Image:OutSchemas.png|175px|thumb|''Figure 2'' - Containment Image Schema (as applied to the English word ''out'')]]

Image schemas are dynamic embodied patterns—they take place ''in'' and ''through'' time. Moreover, they are multi-modal patterns of experience, not simply visual. For instance, consider how the dynamic nature of the containment schema is reflected in the various spatial senses of the English word ''out''. ''Out'' may be used in cases where a clearly defined trajector (TR) leaves a spatially bounded landmark (LM), as in:
:(1a) John went out of the room.
:(1b) Mary got out of the car.
:(1c) Spot jumped out of the pen.

In the most prototypical of such cases the landmark is a clearly defined container. However, ''out'' may also be used to indicate those cases where the trajector is a mass that spreads out, effectively expanding the area of the containing landmark:
:(2a) She poured out the beans.
:(2b) Roll out the carpet.
:(2c) Send out the troops.

Finally, ''out'' is also often used to describe motion along a linear path where the containing landmark is implied and not defined at all:
:(3) The train started out for Chicago.

Experientially basic and primarily spatial image schemas such as the Containment schema and its derivatives the Out schemas lend their logic to non-spatial situations. For example, one may metaphorically use the term ''out'' to describe non-spatial experiences:
:(4) Leave out that big log when you stack the firewood. (Schema used directly and non-metaphorically.)
:(4a) I don't want to leave any relevant data out of my argument. (Schema metaphorically projected onto argumentation.)
:(4b) Tell me your story again, and don't leave out any details. (Schema metaphorically projected onto story-telling.)
:(4c) She finally came out of her depression. (Schema metaphorically projected onto emotional life.)

Johnson argues that more abstract reasoning is shaped by such underlying spatial patterns. For example, he notes that the logic of containment is not just a matter of being in or out of the container. For example, if someone is in a ''deep'' depression, we know it is likely to be a long time before they are well. The deeper the trajector is in the container, the longer it will take for the trajector to get out of it. Similarly, Johnson argues that transitivity and the law of the excluded middle in logic are underlaid by preconceptual embodied experiences of the Containment schema.

==Lakoff: Image schemas in Brugman's ''The story of Over''==
In case study two of his book ''Women, Fire and Dangerous Things'', Lakoff re-presented the analysis of the English word ''over'' done by [[Claudia Brugman]] in her (1981) master's thesis. Similar to the analysis of ''out'' given by Johnson, Lakoff argued that there were six basic spatial schemas for the English word ''over''. Moreover, Lakoff gave a detailed accounting of how these schemas were interrelated in terms of what he called a ''radial category structure''. For example, these six schemas could be both further specified by other spatial schemas such as whether the trajector was in contact with the landmark or not (as in ''the plane flew over the mountain'' vs. ''he climbed over the mountain''). Furthermore, Lakoff identified a group of "transformational" image schemata such as rotational schemas and path to object mass, as in ''Spider-Man climbed all over the wall''. This analysis raised profound questions about how image schemas could be grouped, transformed, and how sequences of image schemas could be chained together in language, mind and brain.

==Relationships to similar theories==
Johnson indicates that his analysis of ''out'' drew upon a 1981 doctoral dissertation by [[Susan Lindner]] in linguistics at UCSD under [[Ronald Langacker]], and more generally by the theory of [[cognitive grammar]] put forth by him.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite book |last=Langacker |first=Ronald W. |authorlink=Ronald Langacker |date=1987 |title=Foundations of Cognitive Grammar: Theoretical Prerequisites |location=Stanford, Calif. |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=0804712611 |oclc=37499775}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the force group of image schemas Johnson also drew on an early version of the [[Force Dynamics|force dynamic]] schemas put forth by [[Len Talmy]], as used by linguists such as [[Eve Sweetser]]. Other influences include [[Max Wertheimer]]'s [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] structure theory and [[Schema (Kant)|Kant's account of schemas]] in categorization, as well as studies in experimental psychology on the [[mental rotation]] of images.

In addition to the dissertation on ''over'' by Brugman, Lakoff's use of image schema theory also drew extensively on Talmy and Langacker's theories of spatial relations terms as well.

==Lists of image schemas==
While Johnson provided an initial list of image schemas in ''The Body in the Mind'' (p.&amp;nbsp;126), his diagrams for them are scattered throughout his book and he only diagrammed a portion of those image schemas he listed. In his work, Lakoff also used several additional schemas.

Since a state of war has been existing between [[Israel]] and [[Syria]] several independent peace initiatives had taken place. Some of them were symbolic, other included more direct steps to get Israelis and Syrians together. Most of them were led by Israeli citizens and by Syrians living abroad.

==Notable Independent Israel-Syria Peace Initiatives==
* '''Alon Liel''', former [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Israel Foreign Ministry]] director general [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2001/4/Dr%20Alon%20Liel], held unofficial talks with Syrian mediaries under the Swiss government's patronage over 2004-2007. He had also initiated a peace movement that published a petition by hundreds of [[Golan Heights]] residents to open peace talks with Syria. [http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3431770,00.html].
* The Israeli band '''[[PingPong (band)|PingPong]]''' tried to promote peace between Israel and Syria during their performance on [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000]].
* '''Ibrahim Suleiman''', Syrian-American negotiator has visited the [[Knesset]] [[Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee]] on April 2007 [http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=451913&amp;TypeID=1&amp;sid=126], insisting that a peace deal with Syria is reachable within six months since Syrian president [[Bashar al-Assad]] is in favor of it. The Israeli Foreign Ministry officially rejected Suleiman's meeting with Israeli officials [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/847617.html].

'''Infatuation''' or '''being smitten''' is the state of being carried away by an unreasoned passion, usually towards another person for which one has developed strong romantic or platonic feelings.

==Characteristics==
Cox says that infatuation can be distinguished from [[romantic love]] only when looking back on a particular interest. Infatuation may also develop into a mature love.&lt;ref&gt;Frank D. Cox, ''Human Intimacy'' (2008) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein and Brandon describe infatuation as the first stage of a relationship before developing into a mature intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;A. Goldstein and M. Brandon, ''Reclaiming Desire'' (2009) p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips describes how the illusions of infatuations inevitably lead to disappointment when learning the truth about a lover.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; It is an object of extravagant, short-lived passion or the temporary love of an adolescent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Infatuation meaning - Spinfold|url = http://www.spinfold.com/infatuation-meaning/|website = Spinfold|access-date = 2016-02-09|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth==

'It is customary to view young people's dating relationships and first relationships as [[puppy love]] or infatuation';&lt;ref&gt;Vappu Tyyska, ''Long and Winding Road'' (2001) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and if infatuation is both an early stage in a deepening sequence of [[love]]/[[Attachment theory|attachment]], ''and'' at the same time a potential stopping point, it is perhaps no surprise that it is a condition especially prevalent in the first, youthful explorations of the world of relationships. Thus 'the first passionate adoration of a youth for a celebrated actress whom he regards as far above him, to whom he scarcely dares lift his bashful eyes'&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; may be seen as part of an 'infatuation with celebrity especially perilous with the young'.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy W. Quinnan, ''Generation Lost'' (2002) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiration plays a significant part in this, as 'in the case of a schoolgirl crush on a boy or on a male teacher. The girl starts off admiring the teacher..[then] may get hung up on the teacher and follow him around'.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (Penguin 1970) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Then there may be [[shame]] at being confronted with the fact that 'you've got what's called a crush on him...Think if someone was hanging around ''you'', pestering and sighing'.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Wynne Jones, ''[[Fire and Hemlock]]'' (London 2000) p. 347-8&lt;/ref&gt; Of course 'sex may come into this...with an infatuated schoolgirl or schoolboy'&lt;ref&gt;Berne, p. 108-10&lt;/ref&gt; as well, producing the 'stricken gaze, a compulsive movement of the throat...an "I'm lying down and I don't care if you walk on me, babe", expression'&lt;ref&gt;L J Smith, ''Night World Vol II'' (2009) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; of infatuation. Such a cocktail of emotions 'may even falsify the "erotic sense of reality": when a person in love estimates his partner's virtues he is usually not very realistic...[[Psychological projection|projection]] of all his ideals onto the partner's personality'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

It is this projection that differentiates infatuation from love, according to the spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]]: "In infatuation, the person is a ''passive victim'' of the spell of conceived attraction for the object. In love there is an ''active appreciation'' of the intrinsic worth of the object of love."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). [http://www.discoursesbymeherbaba.org ''Discourses'']. Volume I. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 159. {{ISBN|978-1-880619-09-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Distance from the object of infatuation—as with [[celebrities]]—can help maintain the infatuated state. A time-honoured cure for the one who 'has a ''tendre''...infatuated' is to have 'thrown them continually together...by doing so you will cure...[or] you will know that it is not an infatuation'.&lt;ref&gt;Georgette Heyer, ''The Grand Sophy'' (London 1974) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Three types of infatuation have been identified by Brown: the first, and perhaps most common, being a state of 'being        'carried away, without insight or proper evaluative judgement, by blind desire'.&lt;ref name=brown-38&gt;Brown, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; The second, 'evaluation...may well be sound although the craving or love remains unaffected by it'; while 'a third type is that of the agent who exhibits bad judgement and misevaluation for reasons such as ignorance or recklessness', regardless of their desire.&lt;ref name=brown-38/&gt;

==In transference==

In [[psychoanalysis]], a sign that the method is taking hold is 'the initial infatuation to be observed at the beginning of treatment',&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; the beginning of [[transference]]. The patient, in [[Freud]]'s words, 'develops a special interest in the person of the doctor...never tires in his home of praising the doctor and of extolling ever new qualities in him'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures in Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; What occurs, 'it is usually maintained...is a sort of false love, a shadow of love', replicating in its course the infatuations of 'what is called true love'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan,''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1993) p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Some however claim that it is wrong to convince the patient 'that their love is an illusion...that it's not you she loves. Freud was off base when he wrote that. It ''is'' you. Who else could it be?'&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;—thereby taking 'the question of what is called true love...further than it had ever been taken'.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Fundamental'' p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, in [[countertransference]], the therapist may become infatuated with his/her client: 'very good-looking...she was the most gratifying of patients. She made literary allusions and understood the ones he made....He was dazzled by her, a little in love with her. After two years, the analysis ground down to a horrible halt'.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual infatuations==

Infatuations need not only involve people, but can extend to objects, activities, and ideas. 'Men are always falling in love with other men...with their war heroes and sport heroes':&lt;ref&gt;Carol O'Connell, ''Flight of the Stone Angel'' (London 1997) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; with institutions, discourses and [[role model]]s. Thus for example [[Jung]]'s initial '"unconditional devotion" to Freud's theories and his "no less unconditional veneration" of Freud's person' was seen at the time by both men as a 'quasi-religious infatuation to...a [[cult]] object';&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (London 1989) p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; while Freud in turn was 'very attracted by Jung's personality',&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (Penguin 1964) p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps 'saw in Jung an idealized version of himself':&lt;ref&gt;Frank McLynn, ''Carl Gustav Jung'' (London 1996) p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; a [[wiktionary:mutual admiration society|mutual admiration society]]—'intellectually infatuated with one another'.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony stevens, ''Jung'' (Oxford 1994) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

A woman too might have 'had a hankering for one ''guru'' after another...she loved being a pupil.'&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Snow, ''Corridors of Power''  (Penguin 1975) p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

But there are also collective infatuations: 'we are all prone to being drawn into ''social phantasy systems'' '.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (Penguin 1972) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for instance 'the recent intellectual infatuation with [[structuralism]] and [[post-structuralism]]'&lt;ref&gt;Sally Banes, ''Terpsichore in Sneakers'' (1980) p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; arguably lasted at least until '[[September 11 attacks|September 11]] ended intellectual infatuation with [[postmodernism]]'&lt;ref&gt;David Stoesz, ''Quixote's Ghost'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; as a whole.

[[Economic bubbles]] thrive on collective infatuations of a different kind: 'all boom-bust processes contain an element of misunderstanding or misconception',&lt;ref&gt;George Soros, ''The New Paradigms for Financial Markets'' (London 2008) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; whether it is the 'infatuation with...becoming the latest [[Dot-com company|dot.com]] billionaire',&lt;ref&gt;Haynes Johnson, ''The Best of Times'' (2001) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; or the one that followed with [[subprime mortgage]]s, once '[[Alan Greenspan|Greenspan]] had replaced the tech bubble with a housing bubble'.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Zuckerman, ''[[The Greatest Trade Ever]]'' (London 2010) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; As markets 'swung virtually overnight from euphoria to fear' in the [[Financial crisis (2007-present)|credit crunch]], even the most hardened [[Market fundamentalism|market fundamentalist]] had to concede that such 'periodic surges of euphoria and fear are manifestations of deep-seated aspects of human nature'&lt;ref&gt;Alan Greenspan, ''The Age of Turbulence'' (Penguin 2008) p. 520-3&lt;/ref&gt;—whether these are enacted in home-room infatuations or upon the global stage.

==Literary depictions==

[[Shakespeare's sonnets]] have been described as a "Poetics for Infatuation"; as being dominated by one theme, and 'that theme is infatuation, its initiation, cultivation, and history, together with its peaks of triumph and devastation'—a lengthy exploration of the condition of being 'subject to the appropriate disorders that belong to our infatuation...the condition of infatuation.'&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Blackmur/J. T Jones, ''Outsider at the Heart of Things'' (1989) p. 242 and p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Whores' Day''' or '''International Sex Workers Day''' is observed annually on June 2 of each year, honours sex workers and recognises their often exploited working conditions. The event commemorates the occupation of [[Église Saint-Nizier]] in [[Lyon]] by more than a hundred sex workers on 2 June 1975 to draw attention to their inhumane working conditions.&lt;ref name="diewelt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article3878794/Kirche-soll-Prostituierte-nicht-ausgrenzen.html |title=Internationaler Hurentag – Kirche soll Prostituierte nicht ausgrenzen (International Whores' Day: The church shouldn't exclude the prostitutes) |date=2009-06-07 |language=German |publisher=Die Welt - Online |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been celebrated annually since 1976. In German, it is known as ''Hurentag'' (Whore's Day). In Spanish-speaking countries, it is the ''Día Internacional de la Trabajadora Sexual'', the International Day of the Sex Worker.

== Background ==
[[File:Sex worker statue Oudekerksplein Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Bronze statue ''Belle'' in front of the [[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]] in the [[De Wallen]] red-light district in [[Amsterdam]]. It was unveiled in March 2007 with the inscription "Respect sex workers all over the world."]]
In the 1970s, French police kept sex workers under increasing pressure. The police reprisals&lt;ref name="diewelt"/&gt; forced sex workers to work increasingly in secret. As a result, protection of sex workers decreased and led to more violence against them. After two murders and the unwillingness of the government to improve the situation, [[sex worker]]s in Lyon occupied the Saint-Nizier church in rue de Brest and went on strike. The striking workers sang political chants and demanded decent working conditions and an end to stigma.

The police cleared the church after eight days.&lt;ref name="bszonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archiv.bszonline.de/index.php/24-archiv/urbi-et-orbi/2392-829-1-2.html |title=Internationaler Hurentag in Bochum (International Whores' Day in Bochum) |date=2010-05-17 |language=German |publisher=Bochumer Stadt- und Studierendenzeitung (bsz) |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event marks the starting point of an international movement of sex workers for [[sex workers' rights]].&lt;ref name="meritt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexclusivitaeten.de/herstory_leselust_09.html |title=Sag mir, wer die Huren sind (Tell me, where are the whores?) |date= |language=German |publisher=Sexclusivitäten - Laura Méritt |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Germany ==
A reading entitled "Women without rooms" in [[Bochum]], [[Germany]] on 29 May 2011 documented that the situation of sex workers has not improved since 1975. The reading was devoted to the sex workers of the neighbouring city of [[Dortmund]], who are oppressed as the sex workers of Lyon were in 1975.&lt;ref name="madonna"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.madonna-ev.de/DOKUMENTE/Lesung_Hurentag_2011pdf.pdf |title=Frauen ohne Zimmer: Lesung zum Internationalen Hurentag 2011 (Women without room: Reading for International Whores' Day) |date= |language=German |publisher=Madonna e.V. |accessdate=2013-06-02 | format=PDF; 414&amp;nbsp;kB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{General relativity sidebar}}

The '''mathematics of general relativity''' is complex. In [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s theories of motion, an object's length and the rate at which time passes remain constant while the object [[Acceleration|accelerates]], meaning that many problems in [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]] may be solved by [[algebra]] alone. In [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], however, an object's length and the rate at which time passes both change appreciably as the object's speed approaches the [[speed of light]], meaning that more variables and more complicated mathematics are required to calculate the object's motion. As a result, relativity requires the use of concepts such as [[Vector space|vector]]s, [[tensor]]s, [[pseudotensor]]s and [[curvilinear coordinates]].

For an introduction based on the example of particles following [[circular orbit]]s about a large mass, nonrelativistic and relativistic treatments are given in, respectively, [[Newtonian motivations for general relativity]] and [[Theoretical motivation for general relativity]].

==Vectors and tensors==
{{main|Euclidean vector|Tensor}}

===Vectors===
[[Image:Vector by Zureks.svg|right|thumb|Illustration of a typical vector.]]

In [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]], a '''Euclidean vector''' (sometimes called a '''geometric'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ivanov|2001}}{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''spatial vector''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heinbockel|2001}}{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt; or – as here – simply a vector) is a geometric object that has both a [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] (or [[Norm (mathematics)#Euclidean norm|length]]) and direction. A vector is what is needed to "carry" the point {{math|''A''}} to the point {{math|''B''}}; the Latin word ''vector'' means "one who carries".&lt;ref&gt;From Latin ''vectus'', [[perfect participle]] of ''vehere'', "to carry".  For historical development of the word ''vector'', see {{OED|vector ''n.''}} and {{cite web|author = Jeff Miller| url = http://jeff560.tripod.com/v.html | title = Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics | accessdate = 2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnitude of the vector is the distance between the two points and the direction refers to the direction of displacement from {{math|''A''}} to {{math|''B''}}. Many [[algebraic operation]]s on [[real number]]s such as [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[negation]] have close analogues for vectors, operations which obey the familiar algebraic laws of [[Commutative property|commutativity]], [[Associative property|associativity]], and [[Distributive property|distributivity]].

===Tensors===
[[Image:Components stress tensor cartesian.svg|300px|right|thumb|Stress, a second-order tensor. Stress is here shown as a series of vectors on each side of the box]]

A tensor extends the concept of a vector to additional dimensions. A [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]], that is, a simple number without a direction, would be shown on a graph as a point, a zero-dimensional object. A vector, which has a magnitude and direction, would appear on a graph as a line, which is a one-dimensional object. A tensor extends this concept to additional dimensions. A two-dimensional tensor would be called a second-order tensor. This can be viewed as a set of related vectors, moving in multiple directions on a plane.

=== Applications ===

Vectors are fundamental in the physical sciences.  They can be used to represent any quantity that has both a magnitude and direction, such as [[velocity]], the magnitude of which is [[speed]]. For example, the velocity ''5 meters per second upward'' could be represented by the vector {{nowrap|(0, 5)}} (in 2 dimensions with the positive {{math|''y''}} axis as 'up'). Another quantity represented by a vector is [[force]], since it has a magnitude and direction. Vectors also describe many other physical quantities, such as [[displacement (vector)|displacement]], [[acceleration]], [[momentum]], and [[angular momentum]].  Other physical vectors, such as the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]], are represented as a system of vectors at each point of a physical space; that is, a [[vector field]].

Tensors also have extensive applications in physics:
* [[Electromagnetic tensor]] (or Faraday's tensor) in [[electromagnetism]]
* [[Finite deformation tensors]] for describing deformations and [[strain tensor]] for [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] in [[continuum mechanics]]
* [[Permittivity]] and [[electric susceptibility]] are tensors in [[anisotropic]] media
* [[Stress–energy tensor]] in [[general relativity]], used to represent [[momentum]] [[flux]]es
* Spherical tensor operators are the eigenfunctions of the quantum [[angular momentum]] operator in [[spherical coordinates]]
* Diffusion tensors, the basis of [[diffusion tensor imaging]], represent rates of diffusion in biologic environments

=== Dimensions ===

In general relativity, four-dimensional vectors, or [[four-vector]]s, are required. These four dimensions are length, height, width and time. A "point" in this context would be an event, as it has both a location and a time. Similar to vectors, tensors in relativity require four dimensions. One example is the [[Riemann curvature tensor]].

=== Coordinate transformation ===

&lt;div style="float:right; border:1px solid black; padding:3px; margin-right: 1em; 
text-align:left"&gt;&lt;gallery widths=200px heights=200px&gt; 
Image:Transformation2polar_basis_vectors.svg|A vector {{math|'''v'''}}, is shown with two coordinate grids, {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. In space, there is no clear coordinate grid to use. This means that the coordinate system changes based on the location and orientation of the observer. Observer {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''}} in this image are facing different directions.
Image:Transformation2polar contravariant vector.svg|Here we see that {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''}} see the vector differently. The direction of the vector is the same. But to {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the vector is moving to its left. To {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the vector is moving to its right.
&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In physics, as well as mathematics, a vector is often identified with a [[tuple]], or list of numbers, which depend on some auxiliary coordinate system or [[frame of reference|reference frame]].  When the coordinates are transformed, for example by rotation or stretching of the coordinate system, then the components of the vector also transform. The vector itself has not changed, but the reference frame has, so the components of the vector (or measurements taken with respect to the reference frame) must change to compensate.

The vector is called [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|''covariant'' or ''contravariant'']] depending on how the transformation of the vector's components is related to the transformation of coordinates. 
* Contravariant vectors are "regular vectors" with units of distance (such as a displacement) or distance times some other unit (such as velocity or acceleration). For example, in changing units from meters to millimeters, a displacement of 1&amp;nbsp;m becomes 1000&amp;nbsp;mm.
* Covariant vectors, on the other hand, have units of one-over-distance (typically such as [[gradient]]). For example, in changing again from meters to millimeters, a gradient of 1&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]/m becomes 0.001&amp;nbsp;K/mm.

In [[Einstein notation]], contravariant vectors and components of tensors are shown with superscripts, e.g. {{math|''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, and covariant vectors and components of tensors with subscripts, e.g. {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.  Indices are "raised" or "lowered" by multiplication by an appropriate matrix, often the identity matrix.

Coordinate transformation is important because relativity states that there is no one correct reference point in the universe. On earth, we use dimensions like north, east, and elevation, which are used throughout the entire planet. There is no such system for space. Without a clear reference grid, it becomes more accurate to describe the four dimensions as towards/away, left/right, up/down and past/future. As an example event, take the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. To a modern observer on [[Mount Rainier]] looking east, the event is ahead, to the right, below, and in the past. However, to an observer in medieval England looking north, the event is behind, to the left, neither up nor down, and in the future. The event itself has not changed, the location of the observer has.

==Oblique axes==

An oblique coordinate system is one in which the axes are not necessarily [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] to each other; that is, they meet at angles other than [[right angle]]s. When using coordinate transformations as described above, the new coordinate system will often appear to have oblique axes compared to the old system.

==Nontensors==
{{see also|Pseudotensor}}

A nontensor is a tensor-like quantity that behaves like a tensor in the raising and lowering of indices, but that does not transform like a tensor under a coordinate transformation. For example, [[Christoffel symbols]] cannot be tensors themselves if the coordinates don't change in a linear way.

In general relativity, one cannot describe the energy and momentum of the gravitational field by an energy–momentum tensor. Instead, one introduces objects that behave as tensors only with respect to restricted coordinate transformations. Strictly speaking, such objects are not tensors at all. A famous example of such a pseudotensor is the [[Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor]].

==Curvilinear coordinates and curved spacetime==

[[Image:Cassini-science-br.jpg|thumb|right|250px|High-precision test of general relativity by the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] space probe (artist's impression): radio signals sent between the Earth and the probe (green wave) are [[Shapiro effect|delayed]] by the warping of [[space and time]] (blue lines) due to the [[Sun]]'s mass. That is, the Sun's mass causes the regular grid coordinate system (in blue) to distort and have curvature. The radio wave then follows this curvature and moves toward the Sun.]]

[[Curvilinear coordinates]] are coordinates in which the angles between axes can change from point to point. This means that rather than having a grid of straight lines, the grid instead has curvature.

A good example of this is the surface of the Earth. While maps frequently portray north, south, east and west as a simple square grid, that is not in fact the case. Instead, the longitude lines running north and south are curved and meet at the north pole. This is because the Earth is not flat, but instead round.

In general relativity, gravity has curvature effects on the four dimensions of the universe. A common analogy is placing a heavy object on a stretched out rubber sheet, causing the sheet to bend downward. This curves the coordinate system around the object, much like an object in the universe curves the coordinate system it sits in. The mathematics here are conceptually more complex than on Earth, as it results in [[Four-dimensional space|four dimensions]] of curved coordinates instead of three as used to describe a curved 2D surface.

==Parallel transport==
{{main|Parallel transport}}

[[Image:parallel displacement.svg|thumb|450px|right|Example: Parallel displacement along a circle of a three-dimensional ball embedded in two dimensions. The circle of radius {{math|''r''}} is embedded in a two-dimensional space characterized by the coordinates {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The circle itself is characterized by coordinates {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} in the two-dimensional space. The circle itself is one-dimensional and can be characterized by its arc length {{math|''x''}}. The coordinate {{math|''y''}} is related to the coordinate {{math|''x''}} through the relation {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''r'' cos {{sfrac|''x''|''r''}}}} and {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''r'' sin {{sfrac|''x''|''r''}}}}. This gives {{math|{{sfrac|∂''y''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;|∂''x''}} {{=}} −sin {{sfrac|''x''|''r''}}}} and {{math|{{sfrac|∂''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|∂''x''}} {{=}} cos {{sfrac|''x''|''r''}}}} In this case the metric is a scalar and is given by {{math|''g'' {{=}} cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{sfrac|''x''|''r''}} + sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{sfrac|''x''|''r''}} {{=}} 1}}. The interval is then {{math|''ds''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''g dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The interval is just equal to the arc length as expected.]]

===The interval in a high-dimensional space===
In a [[Euclidean space]], the separation between two points is measured by the distance between the two points. The distance is purely spatial, and is always positive. In spacetime, the separation between two events is measured by the ''invariant interval'' between the two events, which takes into account not only the spatial separation between the events, but also their temporal separation. The interval, {{math|''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, between two events is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = \Delta r^2 - c^2\Delta t^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;{{spaces|5}}(spacetime&amp;nbsp;interval),

where {{math|''c''}} is the speed of light, and {{math|Δ''r''}} and {{math|Δ''t''}} denote differences of the space and time coordinates, respectively, between the events. The choice of signs for {{math|''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} above follows the [[sign convention#Relativity|space-like convention (−+++)]]. A notation like {{math|Δ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} means {{math|(Δ''r'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The reason {{math|''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is called the interval and not {{math|''s''}} is that {{math|''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be positive, zero or negative.

Spacetime intervals may be classified into three distinct types, based on whether the temporal separation ({{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Δ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) or the spatial separation ({{math|Δ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) of the two events is greater: time-like, light-like or space-like.

Certain types of [[world line]]s are called [[geodesic]]s of the spacetime – straight lines in the case of Minkowski space and their closest equivalent in the curved spacetime of general relativity. In the case of purely time-like paths, geodesics are (locally) the paths of greatest separation (spacetime interval) as measured along the path between two events, whereas in Euclidean space and Riemannian manifolds, geodesics are paths of shortest distance between two points.&lt;ref&gt;This characterization is not universal: both the arcs between two points of a [[great circle]] on a sphere are geodesics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Cosmology and Gravitation |first1=Michael V. |last1=Berry |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |year=1989 |isbn=0-85274-037-9 |page=58 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wTvFxXguod0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=wTvFxXguod0C&amp;pg=PA58 Extract of page 58, caption of Fig. 25]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of geodesics becomes central in [[general relativity]], since geodesic motion may be thought of as "pure motion" ([[Fictitious force|inertial motion]]) in spacetime, that is, free from any external influences.

===The covariant derivative===

{{main|Covariant derivative}}

The covariant derivative is a generalization of the directional derivative from vector calculus. As with the directional derivative, the covariant derivative is a rule, which takes as its inputs: (1) a vector, {{math|'''u'''}}, (along which the derivative is taken) defined at a point {{math|''P''}}, and (2) a vector field, {{math|'''v'''}}, defined in a neighborhood of {{math|''P''}}. The output is a vector, also at the point {{math|''P''}}. The primary difference from the usual directional derivative is that the covariant derivative must, in a certain precise sense, be independent of the manner in which it is expressed in a coordinate system.

===Parallel transport===

Given the covariant derivative, one can define the [[parallel transport]] of a vector {{math|'''v'''}} at a point {{math|''P''}} along a curve {{math|''γ''}} starting at {{math|''P''}}. For each point {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''γ''}}, the parallel transport of {{math|'''v'''}} at {{math|''x''}} will be a function of {{math|''x''}}, and can be written as {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}}, where {{math|'''v'''(0) {{=}} '''v'''}}. The function {{math|'''v'''}} is determined by the requirement that the covariant derivative of {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} along {{math|''γ''}} is 0. This is similar to the fact that a constant function is one whose derivative is constantly 0.

===Christoffel symbols===
{{main|Christoffel symbol}}

The equation for the covariant derivative can be written in terms of Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel symbols find frequent use in Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]], where [[spacetime]] is represented by a curved 4-dimensional [[Lorentz manifold]] with a [[Levi-Civita connection]]. The [[Einstein field equations]] – which determine the geometry of spacetime in the presence of matter – contain the [[Ricci tensor]]. Since the Ricci tensor is derived from the Riemann tensor, which can be written in terms of Christoffel symbols, a calculation of the Christoffel symbols is essential. Once the geometry is determined, the paths of particles and light beams are calculated by [[solving the geodesic equations]] in which the Christoffel symbols explicitly appear.

==Geodesics==
{{main|Geodesics in general relativity}}

In [[general relativity]], a '''geodesic''' generalizes the notion of a "straight line" to curved [[spacetime]]. Importantly, the [[world line]] of a particle free from all external, non-gravitational force, is a particular type of geodesic. In other words, a freely moving or falling particle always moves along a geodesic.

In general relativity, gravity can be regarded as not a force but a consequence of a curved spacetime geometry where the source of curvature is the [[stress–energy tensor]] (representing matter, for instance).  Thus, for example, the path of a planet orbiting around a star is the projection of a geodesic of the curved 4-dimensional spacetime geometry around the star onto 3-dimensional space.

A curve is a geodesic if the [[tangent vector]] of the curve at any point is equal to the [[parallel transport]] of the [[tangent vector]] of the base point.

==Curvature tensor==
{{main|Riemann curvature tensor}}

The Riemann tensor tells us, mathematically, how much curvature there is in any given region of space. Contracting the tensor produces 3 different mathematical objects:

#The [[Riemann curvature tensor]]: {{math|''R&lt;sup&gt;ρ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;σμν&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, which gives the most information on the curvature of a space and is derived from derivatives of the [[metric tensor]]. In flat space this tensor is zero. 
#The [[Ricci tensor]]: {{math|''R&lt;sub&gt;σν&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, comes from the need in Einstein's theory for a curvature tensor with only 2 indices. It is obtained by averaging certain portions of the Riemann curvature tensor.
#The [[scalar curvature]]: {{math|''R''}}, the simplest measure of curvature, assigns a single scalar value to each point in a space. It is obtained by averaging the Ricci tensor.

The Riemann curvature tensor can be expressed in terms of the covariant derivative.

The Einstein tensor {{math|'''G'''}} is a rank-2 [[tensor]] defined over [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s.  In index-free notation it is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}=\mathbf{R}-\tfrac12\mathbf{g}R,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''R'''}} is the [[Ricci tensor]], {{math|'''g'''}} is the [[metric tensor]] and {{math|''R''}} is the [[scalar curvature]]. It is used in the [[Einstein field equations]].

==Stress–energy tensor==
{{main|Stress–energy tensor}}
[[File:StressEnergyTensor contravariant.svg|right|250px|thumb|Contravariant components of the stress–energy tensor.]]

The '''stress–energy tensor''' (sometimes '''stress–energy–momentum tensor''' or '''energy–momentum tensor''') is a [[tensor]] quantity in [[physics]] that describes the [[density]] and [[flux]] of [[energy]] and [[momentum]] in [[spacetime]], generalizing the [[stress (physics)|stress tensor]] of Newtonian physics. It is an attribute of [[matter]], [[radiation]], and non-gravitational [[force field (physics)|force field]]s. The stress–energy tensor is the source of the [[gravitational field]] in the [[Einstein field equations]] of [[general relativity]], just as mass density is the source of such a field in [[Newtonian gravity]].

==Einstein equation==

{{main|Einstein field equations}}
The '''Einstein field equations''' ('''EFE''') or '''Einstein's equations''' are a set of 10 [[equation]]s in [[Albert Einstein|Albert Einstein's]] [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]] which describe the [[fundamental interaction]] of [[gravitation]] as a result of [[spacetime]] being [[curvature|curved]] by [[matter]] and [[energy]].&lt;ref name=ein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein |first=Albert |title=The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity |journal=[[Annalen der Physik]] |volume=354 |issue=7 |pages=769 |year=1916 |publisher= |url=http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |doi=10.1002/andp.19163540702 |format=[[PDF]] |id= |accessdate= |bibcode=1916AnP...354..769E |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829045130/http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |archivedate=2006-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; First published by Einstein in 1915&lt;ref name=Ein1915&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein| first=Albert| authorlink = Albert Einstein| date=November 25, 1915| title=Die Feldgleichungen der Gravitation| journal=Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin| pages=844–847 | url=http://nausikaa2.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/toc/toc.x.cgi?dir=6E3MAXK4&amp;step=thumb | accessdate=2006-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[tensor equation]], the EFE equate local spacetime [[curvature]] (expressed by the [[Einstein tensor]]) with the local energy and [[momentum]] within that spacetime (expressed by the [[stress–energy tensor]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The Einstein Field Equations can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;G_{\mu \nu}= {8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''G&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[Einstein tensor]] and {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[stress–energy tensor]].

This implies that the curvature of space (represented by the Einstein tensor) is directly connected to the presence of matter and energy (represented by the stress–energy tensor).

==Schwarzschild solution and black holes==
{{main|Schwarzschild metric}}
In [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]], the '''Schwarzschild metric''' (also '''Schwarzschild vacuum''' or '''Schwarzschild solution'''),  is a solution to the [[Einstein field equations]] which describes the [[gravitational field]] outside a spherical mass, on the assumption that the [[electric charge]] of the mass, the [[angular momentum]] of the mass, and the universal [[cosmological constant]] are all zero. The solution is a useful approximation for describing slowly rotating astronomical objects such as many [[star]]s and [[planet]]s, including Earth and the Sun. The solution is named after [[Karl Schwarzschild]], who first published the solution in 1916.

According to [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]], the Schwarzschild metric is the most general [[rotational symmetry|spherically symmetric]], [[Vacuum solution (general relativity)|vacuum solution]] of the [[Einstein field equations]]. A '''Schwarzschild black hole''' or '''static black hole''' is a [[black hole]] that has no [[Charge (physics)|charge]] or [[angular momentum]]. A Schwarzschild black hole is described by the Schwarzschild metric, and cannot be distinguished from any other Schwarzschild black hole except by its mass.

'''Jennifer Des''' (born 1975) is a Belgian photographer.

==Style==
She is inspired by [[Francis Bacon (artist)]] in the treatment of the human corpse by manipulating images of [[plastic surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.younggalleryphoto.com/photography/des/des.html The mutilated corpses]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Brussels]], she studied at the '''École de recherche graphique''' in her hometown. She put into practice her studies in [[Kinshasa]] where she worked for six months for the [[French Community of Belgium]].  She had her first individual  exhibition in 2003 at the ''galerie Pascal Polar'' in Brussels. She was selected for the collective exhibition ''175 years of Belgium'' by the Belgian Photography Museum and at the ''Espace Blanche'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espaceblanche.be/crbst_84.html Espace Blanche]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Frédéric Beigbeder]] as her mentor. She exposed with [[Wim Delvoye]] and [[Delphine Boël]] at the Salle des Beaux Arts du [[Sablon (Brussels)|Sablon]] for the ''[[Pierre Bergé]] – [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] Foundation'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://be.linkedin.com/pub/philippe-lichtfus/20/980/254 Concept Interview with Philippe Lichtfus]&lt;/ref&gt;  She made in 2009 an exhibition ''Les Sangtiments'' at the ''Young Gallery'' with her human body work from pictures made (with special admission) from parts of the human body found in the clinic rooms of hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesphotographes.com/interviews/jennifer-des-expose-ses-sangtiments Young Galery ]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012  she had her exposition in the SohoPhoto Gallery in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sohophoto.com/exhibitions/archive/december-2012-exhibitions SohoPhoto Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;
Now Jennifer Des is working on the high-definition photography of the personalized [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] on a [[cosmos|cosmic]] background for the EYE-D project exhibited at the ''Mercedes House'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercedeshouse.be/fr/event/mercedes-house-concerts  Mercedes House concerts p.6]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011, at the ''Top Marques'' in [[Monaco]] in 2014 and at the ''Café de Paris'' in [[Monte Carlo]] March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Monaco Hebdo, 5 March Number 915, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015 at the Park Lenôtre [[Mougins]] with [[Robert Hossein]] and [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://comtesse-tatiana.com/mecenat-prix/#asso Comtesse Tatiana]&lt;/ref&gt;  Invités d'Honneurs.
She had an exposition in March 2016 in the Dark Room Galerie &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkroomgalerie.fr Dark Room Galerie]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Irina Brook]] and [[Soulwax]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.tribuca.legal/online/2016/10/834/#/30 Tribune Bulletin côte d'azur]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelriviera.com/cr2/ Channel Riviera]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelriviera.com/cr2/Article/5291/Darkroom_Galerie_un_regard_sur_la_Vie_un_clin_d_%c5%93il_a_l_Eternite Channel Riviera Web TV]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&amp;v=wwskb3W7Ah8 Galerie Dark Room Vernissage]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiochalomnitsan.com/upload/podcasts/audios/570505fac7d183.64622224.mp3 Radio explication du concept EYE-D]&lt;/ref&gt;

==EYE-D Project: Retinal imprint==
Jennifer Des creates each of her pieces in relation to the model and the request. In addition to its retinal imprint, the stellar presence highlights the dominant planets.
With the help of a professional astrologer, an astral map is made.  Jennifer Des gets her inspiration from this to add extra material to her art. She then integrates it to the eye imprint.  Her clients can also have their own portrait, as well as a portrait with their family member's eyes.

'''José María Sánchez Carrión''' (born 1952, in [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]) is a Spanish linguist, specialised in [[Basque language]], [[sociolinguistics]]&lt;ref&gt;VILLENA PONSODA, Juan Andrés (2006): "The Iberian Peninsula", in AMMON, Ulrich et al. (2006): ''Sociolinguistics: an international handbook of the science of language and society'', Volume 3, 2nd ed., Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, p. 1805. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mZtDIhWzFeUC&amp;pg=PA1805&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[historical linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;TRASK, Robert Lawrence (1997): ''The history of Basque'', London: Routledge, p. 69. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OiemTo_t5r8C&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq]&lt;/ref&gt; He is an associate member of [[Euskaltzaindia]] since 1983. Despite being the best known local academic proponent of reversing language shift measures, he has never held a stable university post in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].&lt;ref&gt;GARDNER, Nicholas (2002): ''Basque in education in the Basque Autonomous Community'', Vitoria-Gasteiz: Gobierno Vasco, p. 54. [http://www.hezkuntza.ejgv.euskadi.net/r43-573/en/contenidos/informacion/dia6/en_2027/adjuntos/Basque_in_Education_i.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicknamed '''Txepetx''' ([[wren]] in Basque language), he is an Anglo-Germanic Philology graduate from the [[University of Salamanca]] and Basque Philology doctorate from the [[University of the Basque Country]], he has served as a Spanish teacher in [[Scotland]], scientific English teacher at the [[University of Granada]], Basque teacher in a rural school of [[Navarre]], and professor of modern languages and literature of Secondary Education in the [[Basque Autonomous Community]] and elsewhere in Spain.

His research on sociolinguistics, the theory of [[bilingualism]] and existential linguistics, includes the following works: ''El estado actual del vascuence en la provincia de Navarra (1970)'' [The current state of Basque language in Navarre (1970)] (1972), "Bilingüismo, diglosia y contacto de lenguas" [Bilingualism, diglossia, and language contact] (''ASJU'', 1974), ''Lengua y pueblo'' [Language and people] (1980) with articles from 1977 originally published in ''[[Punto y Hora de Euskal Herria]]'' magazine, "El marco sociológico y espacial en una situación bilingüe" [The sociological and spatial context in a bilingual setting] (UPV/EHU, 1980), and ''El espacio bilingüe'' [The bilingual space] (1981).

Sánchez Carrión's insistence on the necessity of compacting Basque speakers has been often cited by advocates of the territorial principle of [[linguistic rights]]. Significantly the only article in the 1982 [[Basque Autonomous Community]] Law for the Normalisation of the use of the [[Basque language]] based on the territorial principle, was declared [[unconstitutional]] by the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;GARDNER, Nicholas (2002): ''Basque in education in the Basque Autonomous Community'', Vitoria-Gasteiz: Gobierno Vasco, p. 55. [http://www.hezkuntza.ejgv.euskadi.net/r43-573/en/contenidos/informacion/dia6/en_2027/adjuntos/Basque_in_Education_i.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Far removed from the variational sociolinguistics as from ideological interpretations, he attempts to answer with new perspectives to the problem of why and how languages live and die. He's been a proponent of [[ecolinguistics]] since the mid-eighties of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;SÁNCHEZ CARRIÓN, José María (1985): ''La nueva sociolingüistica y la ecología de las lenguas'', Donostia-San Sebastián: Eusko Ikaskuntza. [http://www.eusko-ikaskuntza.org/en/publications/la-nueva-sociolinguistica-y-la-ecologia-de-las-lenguas/art-10317/]&lt;/ref&gt; However, his most notorious work is his doctoral thesis ''Un futuro para nuestro pasado'' [A future for our past] (1987), as it has offered to many Basque language loyalists a theoretical framework for their activity.&lt;ref&gt;URLA, Jacqueline (2008): "Kafe Antzokia: The Global meets the Local in Basque Cultural Politics", in ROSEMAN, Sharon R. &amp; PARKHURST, Shawn S. (2008): ''Recasting Culture and Space in Iberian Contexts'', New York: State University of New York, pp. 259–261. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cF4GVDXb4b0C&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Further expanding the [[sociohistorical linguistics]] approach of his doctoral thesis, he wrote "Las lenguas vistas desde la historia versus la historia vista desde las lenguas" [Languages seen from the point of view of history versus history seen from the point of view of languages] (EI-SEV, 1992).&lt;ref&gt;XI Basque Studies Congress: Donostia 1991.

Sánchez Carrión's importance for the Basque studies was stressed early on by scholar [[Koldo Mitxelena]],&lt;ref&gt;SALABURU ETXEBERRIA, Pello (2008): ''Koldo Mitxelena: selected writings of a Basque scholar'', Reno: Center for Basque Studies, University of Nevada, p. 75.

{{Christian mysticism}}
In [[Christian theology]], '''''kenosis''''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{Lang|el|κένωσις}}, ''kénōsis'', lit. [the act of emptying]) is the 'self-emptying' of Jesus' own will and becoming entirely receptive to [[God|God's]] divine will.

The word {{lang|el|ἐκένωσεν}} (''ekénōsen'') is used in [[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians]] [http://interlinearbible.org/philippians/2-7.htm 2:7], "&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Jesus]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; made himself nothing ..."{{Bibleref2c|Phil.|2:7|NIV}} ([[New International Version|NIV]]) or "...[he] emptied himself..."{{Bibleref2c|Phil.|2:7|NRSV}} ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]]), using the verb form {{lang|el|κενόω}} (''kenóō'') "to empty". 

==Etymology and definition==
Etymology is from Greek {{lang|el|κενόω}} (''kenóō'') "to empty out". The Liddell–Scott [[Greek–English Lexicon]] gives the following simplified definition simplified for the noun:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dke%2Fnwsis&amp;highlight=empty κέν-ωσις , εως]&amp;nbsp;— A. emptying, depletion, {{lang|el|οὐχὶ πεῖνα καὶ δίψα}} . . {{lang|el|κενώσεις τινές εἰσι}} . . ; [[Plato]] [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]] 585b, cf. Philebus 35b, [[BGU, Berliner griechische Urkunden|BGU]]904.13 (ii A.D.):&amp;nbsp;—poet. {{lang|el|κενέωσις}} , “{{lang|el|πόντου κ. ἀνὰ πέδον}}” [[Pindar]] Fragments 107.12: metaph., emptiness of life “{{lang|el|κένωσις βίου}}” [[Vettius Valens]] 190.30; “{{lang|el|κ. τοῦ γιγνώσκειν}}” [[Iamblichus]] De communi mathematica scientia, 11.
2. (Medical), emptying, evacuation, [[Hippocrates]] Aphorisms 3.8, interpolated in Dsc.2.50; {{lang|el|κ. τῶν οἰκείων}}, [opposite ''katharsis'' {{lang|el|κάθαρσις τῶν ἀλλοτρίων}}], [[Galenus]] 18(2).134. b. depletion, low diet, [opposite ''plerosis'' {{lang|el|πλήρωσις}}, [[Hippocrates]] VM9, cf. Art.49; {{lang|el|κ. σίτου}} ib.50. 3. (of the moon) waning, [opposite ''plerosis'' {{lang|el|πλήρωσις}}], [[Epicurus]] Epistles 2p.40U.&lt;/ref&gt;
# emptying, depletion, emptiness (of life) (e.g. [[Vettius Valens]])
# depletion, low diet, as opposed to ''plerosis'' fullness (e.g. [[Hippocrates]])
# waning (of the moon) (e.g. [[Epicurus]])

==New Testament usage==
The New Testament does not use the actual noun ''kénōsis''&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians (ed. Brooke Foss Westcott, Fenton John Anthony Hort) in I Corinthians, chapter 9: ... {{lang|el|γάρ μοι μᾶλλον ἀποθανεῖν ἢ&amp;nbsp;– τὸ καύχημά μου οὐδεὶς '''κενώσει'''. ἐὰν γὰρ εὐαγγελίζωμαι, οὐκ ἔστιν μοι καύχημα, ἀνάγκη}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the verb form ''kenóō'' occurs five times (Ro.4:14, 1Co.1:17, 9:15, 2Co.9:3, Phil.2:7). Of these five times it is Phil 2:7, in which Jesus is said to have "emptied himself", which is the starting point of Christian ideas of kenosis.

[[John the Baptist]] displayed the attitude when he said of Jesus, "He must become greater; I must become less." (Jn 3:30).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://padretex.com/?p=27 |title=The Initial Movement of the Eucharist |author=Fr. J.

==In Christology==

===Kenotic ethic===
The '''kenotic ethic''' is the [[ethic]] of [[Jesus]], considered as the ethic of [[sacrifice]]. The Philippians passage urges believers to imitate Christ's self-emptying. In this interpretation, Paul was not primarily putting forth a theory about God in this passage, rather he was using God's humility exhibited in the incarnation event as a call for Christians to be similarly subservient to others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Jay Oord]] ''Defining Love: A Philosophical, Scientific, and Theological Engagement'', Brazos Press, 2010. 1-58743-257-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oord. T.J. "Essential Kenosis" in ''The Nature of Love: A Theology'', Chalice Press, 2010. {{ISBN|978-082720828-5}} pp. 149,155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John of the Cross===
{{Refimprove|date=July 2010}}
In [[Christian theology]], ''kenosis'' is the concept of the 'self-emptying' of one's own will and becoming entirely receptive to God and the divine will. It is used both as an explanation of the [[Incarnation]], and an indication of the nature of God's activity and will. [[Mystical theology|Mystical theologian]] [[John of the Cross]]' work "[[Dark Night of the Soul]]" is a particularly lucid explanation of God's process of transforming the believer into the icon or "likeness of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kieran Kavanaugh, O.C.D; Otilio Rodriguez, O.C.D]] ''The collected Works of St. John of The Cross'', ICS Publications, 1991. pp. 353-457.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
The Orthodox Mystical Theology of the East emphasises following the example of Christ. Kenosis is only possible through humility and presupposes that one seeks union with God.  The [[Poustinia]] tradition of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] is one major expression of this search.

Kenosis is not only a Christological issue in Orthodox theology, it has moreover to do with [[Pneumatology (Christianity)|Pneumatology]], namely to do with the Holy Spirit. Kenosis, relative to the human nature, denotes the continual [[epiklesis]] and self-denial of one's own human will and desire. With regard to Christ, there is a kenosis of the Son of God, a condescension and self-sacrifice for the redemption and salvation of all humanity. Humanity can also participate in God's saving work through [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]; becoming holy by grace.&lt;ref&gt;"The oneness of Essence, the Equality of Divinity, and the Equality of Honor of God the Son with the God the Father." Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky pages 92-95 [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0824/_P16.HTM#N5]&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, in Eastern Orthodoxy, theosis never concerns becoming like God in essence or being, which is [[pantheism]]; instead, it concerns becoming united to God by grace, through his [[Essence-Energies distinction|Energies]]. Orthodox theology distinguishes between divine [[Essence-Energies distinction|Essence and Energies]]. Kenosis therefore is a paradox and a mystery since "emptying oneself" in fact fills the person with divine grace and results in union with God. Kenosis in Orthodox theology is the transcending or detaching of oneself from the world or the passions, it is a component of dispassionation. Much of the earliest debates between the Arian and Orthodox Christians were over kenosis. The need for clarification about the human and divine nature of the Christ (see the [[hypostatic union]]) were fought over the meaning and example that Christ set, as an example of kenosis or ekkenosis.&lt;ref&gt;"The oneness of Essence, the Equality of Divinity, and the Equality of Honor of
God the Son with the God the Father." Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky pages 92-95&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
Another perspective is the idea that God is self-emptying. He poured out himself to create the [[cosmos]] and the [[universe]], and everything within it. Therefore, it is our duty to pour out ourselves. (This is similar to C.S. Lewis's statement in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' that a painter pours his ideas out in his work, and yet remains quite a distinct being from his painting.)

===Roman Catholicism===
[[Pope]] [[Pius XII]] in 1951 wrote ''[[Sempiternus Rex Christus]]'', in which he condemns a particular interpretation of [[Philippians]] in regards to the kenosis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is another enemy of the [[Chalcedonian Definition|faith of Chalcedon]], widely diffused outside  the fold of the Catholic religion. This is an opinion for which a rashly and falsely understood sentence of St. Paul's Epistle to the Philippians (ii, 7), supplies a basis and a shape. This is called the  kenotic doctrine, and according to it, they imagine that the divinity was taken away from the Word in Christ. It is a wicked invention, equally to be condemned with the [[Docetism]] opposed to it. It reduces the whole mystery of the Incarnation and Redemption to empty the bloodless imaginations. 'With the entire and perfect nature of man'—thus grandly St. [[Leo the Great]]—'He Who was true God was born, complete in his own nature, complete in ours' (Ep. xxviii, 3. PL. Liv, 763. Cf. Serm. xxiii, 2. PL. lvi, 201).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_pi12sr.htm Sempiternus Rex Christus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Unitarianism===
Since some forms of [[Unitarianism]] do not accept the personal [[pre-existence of Christ]] their interpretations of Phil. 2:7, and the concept of "kenosis", Christ "emptying" himself, take as a starting point that his "emptying" occurred in life, and not before birth. However, as [[Thomas Belsham]] put it, there are varying views on when in life this emptying occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Belsham ''American Unitarianism: or A Brief history of the progress and present state of the Unitarian Churches in America'' 1816 p. 119 "In answer to the inquiry ; when was it, after entering on bis publick ministry, that Christ emptied himself of the form of God, and look on him the form of a servant and the fashion of a man?"&lt;/ref&gt; Belsham took this to be at the [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], whereas [[Joseph Priestley]]&lt;ref&gt;Belsham, op. cit., p. 119 citing Priestley's ''Letters'' p139&lt;/ref&gt; took this to be in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]] when Christ did not resist arrest. The [[Christadelphian]] Tom Barling considered that the "emptying" of Christ was a continual process which started in the earliest references to Christ's character, Luke 2:40,52, and continued through the [[temptations of Christ]] and his [[ministry of Jesus|ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;T.J. Barling ''The Letter to the Philippians'' CMPA Birmingham 1957 p46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gnosticism===
The equivalent to kenōsis in Gnostic literature is Christ's withdrawal of his own luminosity into himself, so as to cease dazzling his own disciples. At the request of his disciples, "Jesus drew to himself the glory of his light".&lt;ref&gt;G. R. S. Mead (translator) : ''Pistis Sophia''. (lib. 1, cap. 6) ) http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/ps/ps010.htm (p. 6)&lt;/ref&gt; There are parallels to this voluntary withdrawal of the incarnate deity's light in the literatures of other religions also, such as in Daoism, where when the incarnate deity "Crane Boy" came to the world of humans in his incarnation as Han Xiangzi, he "concealed his auspicious light, left the underworld, and returned to the world of humans."&lt;ref&gt;Yang Erzeng (translated by Philip Clart) : ''The Story of Han Xiangzi''. University of Washington Press, Seattle, 2007. {{ISBN|0-295-98690-5}}. p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four languages with official status in [[Catalonia]] (an [[autonomous community]] of [[Spain]]): [[Catalan language|Catalan]]; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]- which is official throughout [[Spain]]; [[Aranese]], a [[dialect]] of [[Occitan]] spoken in the [[Aran Valley]]; and [[Catalan Sign Language]].&lt;ref name="estatut_langs"&gt;[http://www.parlament-cat.net/porteso/estatut/estatut_angles_100506.pdf Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826045656/http://www.parlament-cat.net/porteso/estatut/estatut_angles_100506.pdf |date=2013-08-26 }}, Article 50, paragraph 6.

Catalan has enjoyed special status since the approval of the [[Statute of Autonomy of 1979]] which declares it to be the language "proper to Catalonia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gencat.cat/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a6 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528011550/http://www.gencat.cat/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a6 |date=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish had been the only official language for most of the period between the 18th century and 1975.

According to a 2008 survey,&lt;ref name="idescat.cat" /&gt; in everyday use, 45.9% of the population usually spoke Spanish, while 35.6% usually employed Catalan, and 12% of the population used either language habitually.&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/cultura/noticia-catalunya-arabe-urdu-aparecen-lenguas-habituales-catalunya-creando-peligro-guetos-20090629150020.html |title=Árabe y urdu aparecen entre las lenguas habituales de Catalunya, creando peligro de guetos |publisher=Europapress.es |date=2009-06-29 |accessdate=2015-04-10|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 45% of respondents used Spanish to address their parents (versus 36% who choose Catalan).&lt;ref name="idescat.cat"/&gt; This is attributed to extensive migration from other areas in Spain during the second half of the 20th century, as a consequence of which many Catalans have one or both parents born outside Catalonia. However, a majority (52.6%) used Catalan with their children (compared to 42.3% for Spanish). This can be attributed to some Spanish-speaking citizens shifting from their native language to Catalan at home.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Outside the family, 48.6% of the population indicated that they addressed strangers exclusively or preferentially in Catalan, while the proportion of those who used Spanish was 41.7%, and 8.6% claimed to use both equally.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== Social origin of the language diversity ===
The main cause of Spanish and Catalan social [[bilingualism]] in modern Catalonia was large-scale migration from the rest of Spain during the 20th century, as Catalonia started a significant [[industrialization]] which demanded an increased [[workforce]] from elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}} "While the repressive policy of the central authorities had an undeniably negative impact on Catalan use and even on Catalan competence (e.g. an entire generation went through school without any opportunity to acquire or polish Catalan literacy, a limitation that has very recognizable consequences to this very day among most older Catalans), an indirect development of those same years has had even more massive and more devastating consequences for the language. Catalonia had long been one of the most economically advanced areas of Spain and, as a result, its cities (most particularly Barcelona) had long attracted unemployed Spaniards from the rest of the country. These immigrants came in numbers that did not demographically swamp the indigenous (or indigenized) Catalans, and within a generation or more the latest newcomers too were recurringly Catalanized. [...] However, the immigration that transpired between 1950 and 1975 was so huge, relative to Catalonia’s absorptive capacity, that the rather effortless and rapid ethnolinguistic transformation of its members that had formerly been the rule was no longer possible.

The economic consequences of the rapid addition of nearly one and a half million unskilled immigrants to the previous two and a half million 'native Catalans' were not seriously problematic ones for the host population. [...] However, the cultural and intercultural consequences became doubly problematic as social class differences compounded the ethnolinguistic differences separating the two populations. Even now, decades after the end of massive immigration (an immigration that would have been even larger had not whole trainloads of newcomers been turned back prior to their arrival) only slightly more than half of the adult population of Catalonia habitually speaks Catalan, a percentage which is halved again in the immigrant 'industrial belt' surrounding Barcelona where Spanish-speaking newcomers and their children, many of the latter born in Catalonia, are overwhelmingly concentrated."&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish has historically been spoken among a minority of civil servants born in other regions in Spain and among segments of the wealthiest bourgeoisie. Spanish has also been spoken as a second language by most Catalans, as it has been the only official language over long periods since the eighteenth century.

It has been calculated that the total population of Catalonia with no migration would have grown from 2 million people in 1900 to just 2.4 million in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ced.uab.cat/publicacions/PapersPDF/Text183.pdf Anna Cabré: ''Immigration and welfare state'' (in Catalan)] Ced.uab.es (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; 39% of the real population of 6.1 million for that date, which was over 7.5 million in 2016. As a consequence, there exists a somewhat different identity for those whose native language is Catalan and those whose native language is Spanish,&lt;ref name=Strubell1&gt;
"...una societat que, en encetar-se el procés, es trobava escindida entre la població d’origen autòcton, de primera llengua catalana quasi sense excepcions, i la d’origen immigrant, molt majoritàriament monolingüe hispanòfona." (translation: ''a society that, when the process [of schooling in Catalan language] began, was divided between a native population, with Catalan as first language almost without exceptions, and one of immigrant origin, with a large majority of Spanish-only speakers''). https://web.archive.org/web/20091027054000/http://www.geocities.com/m_strubell/060908_frankfurt4.doc De llengua oprimida a centre de gravetat. L’"admirable inversió" del català a les escoles de Catalunya (in Catalan)]&lt;/ref&gt; though it has been increasingly difficult to delineate the two groups; furthermore, there is a small but growing number of Catalans who consider both to be their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;"I és que els dos grups lingüístics majoritaris són avui força més permeables que 30 anys enrere: hi ha més gents capaç de parlar les dues llengües, i també han crescut els sectors socials intermedis (bilingües familiars, bilingües d’identificació, etc.) i les pràctiques bilingües, sobretot entre els més joves".

L’"admirable inversió" del català a les escoles de Catalunya (in Catalan)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to anthropologist [[Kathryn Woolard]], who has studied these identities, Catalans tend to classify anyone as either ''castellà'' (that is, having Spanish as their native language) or ''català'' (that is, having Catalan as their native language).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The claim that the population would have only increased 20% from 1900 to 1980 is disputable since the population of Spain as a whole doubled from 18 to 37 million even allowing for high levels of emigration from the province to the Western Hemisphere and Europe.

== Statistics ==
[[File:Native languages in Catalonia 2008.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Proportional distribution of native languages in Catalonia 2008.&lt;ref name="idescat.cat"&gt;[http://www.idescat.cat/dequavi/?TC=444&amp;V0=15&amp;V1=2&amp;VA=2008&amp;VOK=Confirmar ''Usos lingüístics. Llengua inicial, d'identificació i habitual'']. ''Institut d'Estadística de Catalunya''. Idescat.cat&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to the linguistic census elaborated by the Government of Catalonia corresponding to 2008, 45.92% of citizens over 15 years old declared Spanish as their [only] habitual language of use, versus 35.64% for Catalan, with 11.95% of complete bilinguals; a larger number claims Catalan as "their own language" (37.25% Catalan compared to 46.53% Spanish and 8.81% bilinguals).&lt;ref name="idescat.cat"/&gt;

Lastly, since the [[Statute of Autonomy of 1979]], [[Aranese]]—a [[Gascon language|Gascon]] [[Occitan language|Occitan]] dialect—has been official and subject to special protection in the [[Aran Valley]]. This small area of 7,000 inhabitants was the only place where Occitan (spoken mainly in France and some Italian valleys) received full official status. However, on 9 August 2006, when the new Statute came into force, Aranese became official throughout Catalonia.

==Spanish==
{{Main|Linguistic features of Spanish language spoken by Catalan-speakers|Spanish language}}

According to the government of Catalonia, Spanish, locally known as Castilian, is currently the most spoken language in Catalonia (45.9% daily users of Spanish vs. 35.6% daily users of Catalan vs. 11% daily users of both Spanish and Catalan) and especially in the [[Barcelona metropolitan area]], as well as native language and usual language of many Catalan citizens. This language is widely prevalent in the press, cinema and in daily life.

Spanish is the language that Catalan citizens can read and write the most, due to the fact that until the 1980s it was the only language used in school and in all official communications.

The Spanish language developed from [[Vulgar Latin]] in the North of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], expanding quickly to the South. It has lexical influences from [[Arabic]] and possible [[Substratum|substrate]] influences from [[Basque language|Basque]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]]. It has been the only official language in Spain for most periods since the eighteenth century.

==Catalan==
{{Main|Catalan language}}
According to the official government of Catalonia, Catalan is the second most spoken language of the region, after Spanish (over 35% of Catalans use exclusively Catalan as their first language, while 11% of Catalans use equally both Catalan and Spanish). It is the most spoken language in many [[comarques of Catalonia|comarques]] of Catalonia, with the exception of the Barcelona metropolitan area ([[Barcelonès]] plus surrounding comarques) and [[Camp de Tarragona]]. Catalan is a compulsory subject in schools and enjoys equals rights with Spanish throughout Catalonia.

Since the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] and the approval of a new democratic Constitution in Spain, Catalan has experienced a new revival in its usage, first, due to the liberalisation and devolution of the Catalan linguistic and cultural institutions, and second, to their promotion. However, some political activists claim that Catalan-speaking people continue suffering some types of discrimination, as explained in the European Parliament on January 29, 2014. {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Catalan, a [[Romance language]], is regarded by some Iberian [[linguistics|linguists]] as belonging to the [[Iberian Romance languages|Iberian Romance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proel.org/mundo/catalan.htm |title=Hemos renovado nuestra página y este fichero ya no existe, pero estamos redirigiéndole a la nueva ubicación |publisher=Proel.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; sub-family (which also includes Spanish, Portuguese, Galician, and Aragonese), while others (especially Occitanists) classify it within the [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orbilat.com/Languages/Catalan/Catalan.html |title=Catalan Language |publisher=Orbilat.com |date=1990-12-11 |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; sub-family (which includes [[French language|French]], [[Occitan]] and [[Gallo-Italian]]) languages. It shares attributes with both linguistic groups.

===Literacy===
According to the 2001 Linguistic Census,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/socio/docs/censling2001.pdf |accessdate=August 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108233606/http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/socio/docs/censling2001.pdf |archivedate=November 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about 5,900,000 people in Catalonia (nearly 95% of the population) understand the Catalan language. The percentage of people aged two and older who can speak, read and write Catalan is as follows:

| &amp;nbsp;

As a result of the ongoing linguistic [[affirmative action|policies favouring]] Catalan, implemented in various degrees by the autonomous government during the last 20 years, knowledge of Catalan has advanced significantly in all these areas, with the ability to write it having experienced the most pronounced increase, from 31.6% of the population in 1986 to 49.8% in 2001.

By age groups, those between 10 and 29 have the highest level of Catalan-language literacy (e.g., 98.2% aged 10&amp;ndash;14 understand it, and 85.2% can write it); this is attributed to these individuals having received their education in Catalan.

Geographically, Catalan is understood in northwest Catalonia ([[High Pyrenees]], [[Aran Valley]]), at 97.4%, followed by south and western Catalonia, whereas [[Barcelona]]'s metropolitan area sees the lowest knowledge, at 93.8%.  The situation is analogous for written-language skills, with central Catalonia scoring the highest percentages (61.4%), and Barcelona the lowest (46.4%).

Barcelona is one of the main centres of the Spanish publishing industry for both Spanish-language and Catalan-language publishing.

==Aranese==
{{Main|Aranese dialect|Occitan language}}

According to the 2001 [[Aranese]] Linguistic Census,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/aran/docs/a_aran_cens.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626042846/http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/aran/docs/a_aran_cens.pdf |date=June 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; knowledge of Aranese in the Occitan-speaking territory of Aran is as follows:

{{clear}}

Compared to previous data from 1996, the number of those able to understand Aranese has declined slightly (90.5% in 1996), while at the same time there has been a marginal increase in the number of those able to write it (24.97% in 1996).

By age groups, the largest percentage of those with knowledge of Aranese is in the 15-19 and 65-69 groups (both above 96%), while those aged 30–34 score lowest (just over 80%).  Literacy is higher in the 10-19 group with over 88% declaring themselves able to read, and 76% able to write Aranese. Those over 80 are the least literate, with only about 1.5% of them being able to write the language.

In everyday use, according to 2008 data, Spanish is the main language in the Aran valley, habitually spoken by 38% of the population, then followed by Aranese, spoken by 23.4% of the population. In Aran, Catalan is the third language, habitually spoken by 16% of the population.&lt;ref name="ref" /&gt;

==Catalan Sign Language==
{{Main|Catalan Sign Language}}

According to [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=csc Ethnologue], about 18,000 [[Deaf culture|deaf]] Catalans use Catalan Sign Language (LSC, ''Llengua de signes catalana''). Since, like other [[deaf sign languages]], LSC has no generally used written form, there is no literacy data.

==Immigrant languages in Catalonia==
{{Main|Immigration to Spain}}

As a part of the intense immigration process which Spain in general and Catalonia in particular have experienced over the last decade, there is a large number of [[immigrant language]]s spoken in various cultural communities in Catalonia, of which ([[Maghrebi Arabic|Maghrebi]]) [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hindustani language|Urdu]] are the most common&lt;ref name="ref" /&gt; if Spanish-speaking migrants are not taken into account.

From all four [[Outline of Catalonia#Provinces of Catalonia|Provinces of Catalonia]], the largest number of habitual foreign language speakers are located in [[Girona (province)|Girona]].&lt;ref name="ref" /&gt;

==Political and social issues==
Under the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] dictatorship Catalan was, until the 1970s, excluded from the state education system and all other official and governmental use, including the prohibition of baptizing children with certain Catalan names. [[Rural-urban migration]] originating in other parts of Spain reduced the social use of the language in urban areas. Lately, a similar [[sociolinguistic]] phenomenon has occurred with foreign immigration.

Today, Catalan is the language of the Catalan autonomous government and the other public institutions that fall under its jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12501023 | work=The Economist | title=How much is enough? | date=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Catalan Government rules, businesses are required to display all information (e.g. menus, posters) in Catalan under penalty of legal fines; following Spanish Government rules,&lt;ref name="plataforma-llengua.cat"&gt;[https://www.plataforma-llengua.cat/media/assets/1583/500_lleis_que_imposen_el_castell__des_2009_DEF.pdf "500 lleis que imposen el castellà", Plataforma per la Llengua, 2009] (In Catalan) Plataforma-llengua.cat (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; there's the same obligation to display this information in Spanish; there is no obligation to display this information in Aranese, although there is no restriction on doing so in these or other languages.

The [[language policy]] favouring Catalan consistently implemented by the successive governments ruling the regional government of Catalonia since the 1980s has become increasingly contentious and controversial during the 2000s, especially in [[public education]].

In this context, Catalan was the only language of instruction between 1979 and 2012. Thus, pupils were [[language immersion|immersed in Catalan]] except for three hours per week of Spanish medium instruction. However, the most recent Spanish Education Law and some judicial sentences aim at increasing the time of instruction in Spanish for other subjects, if only one child per class asks it, even if the other families don't agree, because of complaints that current policies hinder the right to an education in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eur/136059.htm |title=2009 Human Rights Report: Spain |publisher=State.gov |date=2010-03-11 |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some political parties and civic organizations denounce this situation in which a co-official language like Spanish is barred from public education, claiming that this is a severe breach of civic rights and against the spirit of free circulation of people within Spain. In September 2008 a demonstration was held in Barcelona to support full coexistence of both languages without linguistic discrimination of either.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20081001044632/http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20080928/53550121278.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012 the [[Supreme Court of Spain]] ruled that schools must also use Spanish as a medium of instruction, if parents wish it, and cannot force Catalan-language education on the entire population, citing the disadvantage of the inability {{Clarify|date=September 2012}} to be educated in the national language and the necessity of maintaining the ability for citizens to move from one part of Spain to another without learning the local language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20120701/54319269947/catalan-bajo-prision.html |title=La lengua catalana, bajo presión |publisher=Lavanguardia.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-10|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-Catalan language activists claim that some activities cannot be done in Catalan, because almost 500 different rules&lt;ref name="plataforma-llengua.cat"/&gt; are forbidding the use of any language except Spanish or because delegations of the Spanish Government do not accept the use of documents written in Catalan, though it is a co-official language in Catalonia.

'''Legality''' can be defined as an act, agreement, or contract that is consistent with the law or state of being lawful or unlawful in a given jurisdiction.

According to merriam-webster dictionary definition of Legality is 1 : attachment to or observance of law. 2 : the quality or state of being legal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legality|title=Definition of LEGALITY|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businessdictionary.com, thelawdictionary.org, and mylawdictionary.org definition explains concept of ''attachment to law'' as ''Implied warranty that an act, agreement, or contract strictly adheres to the statutes of a particular jurisdiction. For example, in insurance contracts it is assumed that all risks covered under the policy are legal ventures.'' The second definition cited by Businessdictionary.com '' Legal principle that an accused may not be prosecuted for an act that is not declared a crime in that jurisdiction.'' is actually about Principle of legality which is part of over all concept of legality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/legality.html|title=What is legality? definition and meaning|work=businessdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelawdictionary.org/legality/|title=What is LEGALITY? definition of LEGALITY (Black's Law Dictionary)|work=thelawdictionary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How we interpret the reality of our actual understanding of a concept manifests itself through the different individual narratives that we tell about the origins and meanings of a particular concept. The difference in narratives, about the same set of facts, is what divides us. An individual has the ability to frame, or understand, something very differently than the next person. Evidence does not always lead to a clear attribution of the specific cause or meaning of an issue – meanings are derived through narratives. Reality, and the facts that surround it, are personally subjective and laden with assumptions based on clearly stated facts. Anna-Maria Marshall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Injustice Frames, Legality, and the Everyday Construction of Sexual Harassment|journal=Law &amp; Social Inquiry|first=Anna-Maria|last=Marshall|date=1 July 2003|publisher=|volume=28|issue=3|pages=659–689|doi=10.1111/j.1747-4469.2003.tb00211.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; states, this shift in framing happens because our perceptions depend “on new information and experiences;” this very idea is the basis of Ewick and Sibley definition of legality – our everyday experiences shape our understanding of the law.

Ewik and [[Joel H. Silbey|Silbey]] define Legality more broadly as, ''those meanings, sources of authority, and cultural practices that are in some sense legal although not necessarily approved or acknowledged by official law. The concept of legality the opportunity to consider "how where and with what effect law is produced in and through commonplace social interactions....How do our roles and statuses our relationships, our obligations, prerogatives and responsibilities, our identities and our behavoiurs bear the imprint of law.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0Vgm5KYYjsC|title=Global Legal Pluralism: A Jurisprudence of Law Beyond Borders|first=Paul Schiff|last=Berman|date=27 February 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0-521-76982-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper on Normative Phenomena of Morality, Ethics and Legality',  Legality is defined taking states role in to account  as, ''The system of laws and regulations of right and wrong behavior that are enforceable by the state (federal, state, or local governmental body in the U.S.) through the exercise of its policing powers and judicial process, with the threat and use of penalties,
including its monopoly on the right to use physical violence. ''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2139/ssrn.920625|title=Integrity: A Positive Model that Incorporates the Normative Phenomena of Morality, Ethics and Legality|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|year=2009|last1=Erhard|first1=Werner|last2=Jensen|first2=Michael C.|last3=Zaffron|first3=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle of legality ==
The ''principle of legality'' is the legal ideal that requires all [[law]] to be clear, ascertainable and non-retrospective. It requires decision makers to resolve disputes by applying legal rules that have been declared beforehand, and not to alter the legal situation retrospectively by discretionary departures from established law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|
title=Fair Notice and Fair Adjudication: two kinds of legality|first=Paul H.|last= Robinson
|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/601}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to [[legal formalism]] and the [[rule of law]] and can be traced from the writings of [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach|Feuerbach]], [[A. V. Dicey|Dicey]] and [[Montesquieu]].

The principle has particular relevance in [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[administrative law]]. In criminal law it can be seen in the general prohibition on the imposition of criminal sanctions for acts or omissions that were not criminal at the time of their commission or omission. The principle is also thought to be violated when the sanctions for a particular crime are increased with retrospective effect.

In administrative law it can be seen in the desire for state officials to be bound by and apply the law rather than acting upon whim. As such advocates of the principle are normally against discretionary powers.

The principle can be varyingly expressed in Latin phrases such as ''[[Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali]]'' (No crime can be committed, nor punishment imposed without a pre-existing penal law), ''[[nulla poena sine lege]]'' (no penalty without law) and ''nullum crimen sine lege'' (no crime without law). A law that violates the principle by retroactively making actions illegal that were committed before the enactment of the law is called an ''[[ex post facto law]]''.

== Other related concepts ==
[[Rule of law]] provides for availability of rules, laws and legal mechanism to implement them. Principle of legality checks for availability and quality of the laws. Legality checks for if certain behaviour is according to law or not. concept of Legitimacy of law looks for fairness or acceptability of fairness of process of implementation of law.

quality of being legal and observance to the law may pertain to lawfullness, i.e. being consistent to the law or it may get discussed in principle of legality or may be discussed as legal legitimacy.

===Legality of purpose===
In contract law, legality of purpose is required of every enforceable contract. One can not validate or enforce a contract to do activity with unlawful purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/example/%5Bfield_short_title-raw%5D_26|title=Legality of purpose – contracts|first=Michael|last=Litvin|date=15 September 2009|work=cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constitutional legality ===
The principle of legality can be affected in different ways by different constitutional models. In the [[United States]], laws may not violate the stated provisions of the [[United States Constitution]] which includes a prohibition on retrospective laws. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] under the doctrine of [[Parliamentary sovereignty]], the legislature can (in theory) pass such retrospective laws as it sees fit, though article 7 of the European convention on human rights, which has legal force in Britain, forbids conviction for a crime which was not illegal at the time it was committed. Article 7 has already had an effect in a number of cases in the British courts.

In contrast many written constitutions prohibit the creation of  [[Ex post facto law|retroactive]] (normally criminal) laws{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}. However the possibility of statutes being struck down creates its own problems. It is clearly more difficult to ascertain what is a valid statute when any number of statutes may have constitutional question marks hanging over them. When a statute is declared unconstitutional, the actions of public authorities and private individuals which were legal under the invalidated statute, are retrospectively tainted with illegality. Such a result could not occur under parliamentary sovereignty (or at least not before [[Factortame]]) as a statute was law and its validity could not be questioned in any court.

==International law==
Legality, in its criminal aspect, is a principle of [[international human rights law]], and is incorporated into the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. However the imposition of penalties for offences illegal under [[international law]] or criminal according to "the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations" are normally excluded from its ambit. As such the trial and punishment for [[genocide]], [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] does not breach international law.

There is some debate about whether this is really a true exception or not. Some people would argue that it is a derogation or – perhaps somewhat more harshly – an infringement of the principle of legality. While others would argue that crimes such as genocide are contrary to [[natural law]] and as such are always illegal and always have been. Thus imposing punishment for them is always legitimate. The exception and the natural law justification for it can be seen as an attempt to justify the [[Nuremberg trials]] and the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]], both of which were criticized for applying retrospective criminal sanctions.

The [[territorial principle]], generally confining national jurisdiction to a nation’s borders, has been expanded to accommodate extraterritorial, [[national interest]].

In criminal law, the principle of legality assures the primacy of law in all criminal proceedings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16900">'''Lifeworld''' ({{lang-de|Lebenswelt}}) may be conceived as a universe of what is self-evident or given,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/epis-per.htm The given] further explained&lt;/ref&gt; a world that subjects may experience together.&lt;ref&gt;[[Intersubjectivity#Definition]]&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Edmund Husserl]], the lifeworld is the fundamental for all [[epistemology|epistemological]] enquiries. The concept has its origin in biology and [[Protestant culture|cultural Protestantism]].&lt;ref&gt;fn: a German ''fin-de-siècle'' movement, which questioned the church hierarchy and sought to combine protestant and scientific beliefs (Treitel, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eden, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The lifeworld concept is used in [[philosophy]] and in some [[social sciences]], particularly [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]]. The concept emphasizes a state of affairs in which the world is experienced, the world is lived (German ''erlebt''). The lifeworld is a pre-epistemological stepping stone for [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] analysis in the Husserlian tradition.

==The phenomenological concept==
{{See also|Worldview}}

[[Edmund Husserl]] introduced the concept of the lifeworld in his ''[[The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology]]'' (1936):

{{quote|In whatever way we may be conscious of the world as universal horizon, as coherent universe of existing objects, we, each "I-the-man" and all of us together, belong to the world as living with one another in the world; and the world is our world, valid for our consciousness as existing precisely through this 'living together.' We, as living in wakeful world-consciousness, are constantly active on the basis of our passive having of the world... Obviously this is true not only for me, the individual ego; rather we, in living together, have the world pre-given in this together, belong, the world as world for all, pre-given with this ontic meaning... The we-subjectivity... [is] constantly functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund. (1936/1970). The Crisis of the European Sciences, pp. 108-109&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This collective inter-subjective pool of perceiving, Husserl explains, is both universally present and, for humanity's purposes, capable of arriving at 'objective truth,' or at least as close to objectivity as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund. (1936/1970). The Crisis of the European Sciences, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'lifeworld' is a grand theatre of objects variously arranged in space and time relative to perceiving subjects, is already-always there, and is the "ground" for all shared human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund. (1936/1970). The Crisis of the European Sciences, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Husserl's formulation of the lifeworld was also influenced by [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]'s "life-nexus" (German ''Lebenszusammenhang'') and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s Being-in-the-world{{cn|date=February 2013}} (German ''In-der-Welt-Sein''). The concept was further developed by students of Husserl such as [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Jan Patočka]], and [[Alfred Schütz]]. The lifeworld can be thought of as the horizon of all our experiences, in the sense that it is that background on which all things appear as themselves and meaningful. The lifeworld cannot, however, be understood in a purely static manner; it isn't an unchangeable background, but rather a dynamic horizon in which we ''live'', and which "lives with us" in the sense that nothing can appear in our lifeworld except as ''lived''.

The concept represented a turning point in Husserl's [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] from the tradition of [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Up until then, Husserl had been focused on finding, elucidating, and explaining an absolute foundation of philosophy in consciousness, without any presuppositions except what can be found through the reflective analysis of consciousness and what is immediately present to it. Originally, all judgments of the real were to be "[[bracketing (phenomenology)|bracketed]]" or suspended, and then analyzed to bring to light the role of consciousness in constituting or constructing them. With the concept of the lifeworld, however, Husserl embarked on a different path, which recognizes that, even at its deepest level, consciousness is already embedded in and operating in a world of meanings and pre-judgements that are socially, culturally, and historically constituted. Phenomenology thereby became the study not just of the pure consciousness and meanings of a transcendental ego, as in Husserl's earlier work, but of consciousness and meaning in context. The lifeworld is one of the more complicated concepts in phenomenology, mainly because of its status as both personal and intersubjective.

Even if a person's [[historicity (philosophy)|historicity]] is intimately tied up with his lifeworld, and each person thus has a lifeworld, this doesn't necessarily mean that the lifeworld is a purely individual phenomenon. In keeping with the phenomenological notion of [[intersubjectivity]], the lifeworld can be intersubjective even though each individual ''necessarily'' carries his own "personal" lifeworld ("homeworld"); meaning is intersubjectively accessible, and can be communicated (shared by one's "homecomrades"). However, a homeworld is also always limited by an alienworld. The internal "meanings" of this alienworld ''can'' be communicated, but can never be apprehended ''as alien''; the alien can only be appropriated or assimilated into the lifeworld, and only understood on the background of the lifeworld.

==The sociological concept==
The Husserlian elucidation of lifeworld provided a starting point for the phenomenological sociology of [[Alfred Schütz]], who tried to synthesize Husserl's phenomenology of consciousness, meaning, and the life-world with [[Max Weber]]'s sociology and its focus on subjectively meaningful action. [[Jürgen Habermas]] has further developed the concept of the lifeworld in his social theory. For Habermas, the lifeworld is more or less the "background" environment of competences, practices, and attitudes representable in terms of one's cognitive horizon. Compared to Husserl with his focus on consciousness, however, Habermas, whose social theory is grounded in communication, focuses on the lifeworld as consisting of socially and culturally sedimented linguistic meanings. It is the lived realm of informal, culturally-grounded understandings and mutual accommodations. [[Rationalization (sociology)|Rationalization]] and colonization of the lifeworld by the instrumental rationality of bureaucracies and market-forces is a primary concern of Habermas's two-volume ''[[Theory of Communicative Action]]''.

For Habermas, [[communicative action]] is governed by [[practical reason|practical rationality]]—ideas of social importance are mediated through the process of linguistic communication according to the rules of practical rationality. By contrast, [[instrumental reason|technical rationality]] governs ''systems''&lt;!--Not to be confused with systems in systems theory--&gt; of instrumentality, like industries, or on a larger scale, the [[capitalism|capitalist economy]] or the [[liberal democracy|democratic political government]]. Ideas of instrumental importance to a system are mediated according to the rules of that system (the most obvious example is the capitalist economy's use of [[currency]]). [[Self-deception]], and thus systematically distorted communication, is possible only when the lifeworld has been 'colonized' by instrumental rationality, so some social norm comes into existence and enjoys [[legitimation|legitimate]] power even though it is not justifiable. This occurs when means of mediating instrumental ideas gains communicative [[Power (philosophy)|power]]—as when someone pays a group of people to stay quiet during a public [[debate]], or if financial or administrative resources are used to advertise some social viewpoint. When people take the resulting [[consensus]] as normatively relevant, the lifeworld has been colonized and [[communication]] has been systematically distorted. The '[[colonialism|colonization]]' [[metaphor]] is used because the use of steering media to arrive at social consensus is not native to the lifeworld—the decision-making processes of the systems world must encroach on the lifeworld in a way that is in a sense imperialistic:

{{cquote|When stripped of their [[ideology|ideological]] veils, the imperatives of autonomous subsystems make their way into the lifeworld from the outside—like colonial masters coming into a [[tribal society]]—and force a process of assimilation upon it. The diffused perspectives of the local [[culture]] cannot be sufficiently coordinated to permit the play of the metropolis and the world market to be grasped from the periphery.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, 1987, The Theory of Communicative Action, Vol. 2, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The fragmentation of consciousness associated with the two [[Marxism|Marxist]] concepts of [[Social alienation|alienation]] and [[false consciousness]] illustrate why, in Habermas' perspective, they are merely special cases of the more general phenomenon of lifeworld colonization.

Social coordination and systemic regulation occur by means of shared practices, beliefs, values, and structures of communicative interaction, which may be institutionally based. We are inevitably lifeworldly, such that individuals and interactions draw from custom and cultural traditions to construct identities, define situations, coordinate action, and create social solidarity. Ideally this occurs by communicatively coming to understanding (German ''[[Verstehen]]''), but it also occurs through pragmatic negotiations (compare: Seidman, 1997:197).

The lifeworld is related to further concepts such as [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s notion of ''[[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]'' and to the sociological notion of [[everyday life]].

==The epistemological concept==

In the course of recent constructivist discourses a discussion about the lifeworld term took place as well. [[Björn Kraus|Björn Kraus']] [[relational-constructivist]]&lt;ref&gt;Björn Kraus: Plädoyer für den Relationalen Konstruktivismus und eine Relationale Soziale Arbeit. in Forum Sozial (2017) 1 pp. 29-35 http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/51948&lt;/ref&gt; version of the lifeworld term considers its phenomenological roots ([[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] and [[Alfred Schütz|Schütz]]), but expands it within the range of [[constructivist epistemology|epistemological constructivist]] theory building.&lt;ref&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''Erkennen und Entscheiden. Grundlagen und Konsequenzen eines erkenntnistheoretischen Konstruktivismus für die Soziale Arbeit''. Beltz Juventa, Weinheim/Basel 2013. P. 145 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence, a new approach is created, which is not only focusing on the individual perspective upon the lifeworld term, but is also taking account of social and material environmental conditions and their relevance as emphasized for example by [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]]. Essential therefore is Kraus' basic assumption that cognitive development depends on two determining factors. On the one hand a person's own reality is her subjective construct. On the other hand this construct—in spite of all [[subjectivity]]—is not random: Since a person is still linked to her environment, her own reality is influenced by the conditions of this environment (German ''Grundsätzliche Doppelbindung menschlicher Strukturentwicklung'').&lt;ref&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''Erkennen und Entscheiden. Grundlagen und Konsequenzen eines erkenntnistheoretischen Konstruktivismus für die Soziale Arbeit''. Beltz Juventa, Weinheim/Basel 2013. P. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Building up on this point of view, a separation of individual perception and the social and material environmental conditions is made possible. Kraus accordingly picks up the lifeworld term, adds the term "life conditions" (German ''Lebenslage''&lt;ref&gt;See Neurath 1931 /Weisser 1956 in Björn Kraus: Lebenswelt und Lebensweltorientierung – eine begriffliche Revision als Angebot an eine systemisch-konstruktivistische Sozialarbeitswissenschaft. Kontext. Zeitschrift für Systemische Therapie und Familientherapie. Göttingen: Vandenhoek &amp; Ruprecht. Heft 37/02, 2006 p.&amp;nbsp;116–129. Also available online: http://www.webnetwork-nordwest.de/sowi/article.php?sid=92 2004, p. 7. See also Björn Kraus 2013, p. 143 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;) and opposes the two terms to each other.

By this means, lifeworld describes a person's subjectively experienced world, whereas life conditions describe the person's actual circumstances in life. Accordingly, it could be said that a person's lifeworld is built depending on their particular life conditions. More precisely, the life conditions include the material and immaterial living circumstances as for example employment situation, availability of material resources, housing conditions, social environment (friends, foes, acquaintances, relatives, etc.) as well as the persons physical condition (fat/thin, tall/small, female/male, healthy/sick, etc.). The lifeworld, in contrast, describes the subjective [[perception]] of these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''Erkennen und Entscheiden. Grundlagen und Konsequenzen eines erkenntnistheoretischen Konstruktivismus für die Soziale Arbeit''. Beltz Juventa, Weinheim/Basel 2013. P. 152 f.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kraus uses the epistemological distinction between subjective reality and objective reality.  Thus, a person's lifeworld correlates with the person's life conditions in the same way than subjective reality correlates with objective reality. The one is the insurmountable, subjective construct built depending on the other one's conditions.&lt;ref&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''The Life We Live and the Life We Experience: Introducing the Epistemological Difference between “Lifeworld” (Lebenswelt) and “Life Conditions” (Lebenslage)'' Social Work and Society. International Online Journal. Vol. 13, No. 2 2015, http://www.socwork.net/sws/article/view/438; Björn Kraus: ''Erkennen und Entscheiden.''. Beltz Juventa, Weinheim/Basel 2013. P. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kraus defined lifeworld and life conditions as follows:

''"Life conditions mean a person's material and immaterial circumstances of life.''

''Lifeworld means a person's subjective construction of reality, which he or she forms under the condition of his or her life circumstances."''&lt;ref&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''The Life We Live and the Life We Experience: Introducing the Epistemological Difference between "Lifeworld" (Lebenswelt) and "Life Conditions" (Lebenslage)'' Social Work and Society. International Online Journal. Vol. 13, No. 2 2015, P. 4. http://www.socwork.net/sws/article/view/438&lt;/ref&gt;

This contrasting comparison provides a conceptual specification, enabling in the first step the distinction between a subjectively experienced world and its material and social conditions and allowing in the second step to focus on these conditions' relevance for the subjective construction of reality.

With this in mind, Manfred Ferdinand, who is reviewing the lifeworld terms used by [[Alfred Schütz]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Björn Kraus]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], concludes: Kraus' "thoughts on a constructivist comprehension of lifeworlds contours the integration of micro-, meso- and macroscopic approaches, as it is demanded by Invernizzi and Butterwege: This integration is not only necessary in order to relate the subjective perspectives and the objective frame conditions to each other but also because the objective frame conditions obtain their relevance for the subjective lifeworlds not before they are perceived and assessed."&lt;ref&gt;See Manfred Ferdinand: Lebenswelten - Lebensschnüre. Heidelberger Studien zur praktischen Theologie.: Lit Verlag: Münster 2014, S. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common in both [[politics]] and [[public relations]].

Saying "I'm sorry you feel that way" to someone who has been offended by a statement is a non-apology apology. It does not admit there was anything wrong with the remarks made, and may imply the person took offense for hypersensitive or irrational reasons. Another form of non-apology does not apologize directly to the injured or insulted party, but generically "to anyone who might have been offended".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/elisadoucette/2014/11/30/the-art-of-apologies-and-why-elizabeth-lauten-failed-miserably-at-hers/|title=The Art Of Online Apologies And Why Elizabeth Lauten Failed Miserably At Hers|last=Doucette|first=Elisa|date=November 30, 2014|work=Forbes|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statements that use the word "sorry" but do not express responsibility for wrongdoing may be meaningful expressions of regret, but such statements can also be used to elicit forgiveness without acknowledging fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lazare|first=Aaron|title=On Apology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P9iADDrEI_AC|accessdate=3 October 2012|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518911-7|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal significance==

===United States===
Non-apology apologizers may be trying to avoid [[litigation]] that might result from an admission of [[culpability|guilt]] or [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]].&lt;ref name="use google"&gt;[http://www.wm.edu/law/institutesprograms/lawtcp/documents/megan_e_bisk.doc+plaintiff+from+using+an+apology+as+evidence+of+liability&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=17&amp;gl=us&amp;client=opera Apology Statutes: A 22 State Survey] {{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many states, including [[Massachusetts]] and [[California]], have laws to prevent a [[plaintiff]] from using an apology as evidence of liability.&lt;ref name="Frieswick"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ww2.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2001/05/say-youre-sorry/ | title=Say You’re Sorry | work=CFO | date=1 May 2001 | accessdate=26 February 2014 | author=Frieswick, Kris}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a medical doctor may apologize to a patient for a bad outcome without fearing the apology can be used against them at trial as evidence of [[negligence]].&lt;ref name="Bartolomei"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hahslaw.com/article-04.shtml | title=Apologies in the World of Litigation | publisher=Hill, Adams, Hall &amp; Scheiffelin, P.A. | accessdate=26 February 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621112606/http://hahslaw.com/article-04.shtml | archivedate=21 June 2006 | last1=Bartolomei | first1=Matt | last2=Black | first2=Robin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In November 2008, the Alberta legislature passed an amendment to the existing Alberta Evidence Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. A-18, geared at protecting apologizing parties from risks of legal liability and loss of insurance coverage. Section 26.1 of the Act provides that an apology does not constitute an express or implied admission of fault or liability.&lt;ref name="Curial2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.millerthomson.com/assets/files/article_attachments/Please%20Don't%20Sue%20Me.pdf | publisher=Miller Thomson | date=3 June 2010 | accessdate=26 February 2014 | first1=Brian | last1=Curial | title=I'm Sorry (Please Don't Sue Me) | last2=Chau | first2=Maria | last3=Thomson | first3=Miller | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

=== "Mistakes were made" ===
The expression "[[mistakes were made]]" is commonly used as a [[rhetorical device]], whereby a speaker acknowledges a situation was handled poorly or inappropriately but seeks to evade any direct admission or accusation of responsibility by using the [[passive voice]]. The acknowledgement of "mistakes" is framed in an abstract sense with no direct reference to ''who'' made the mistakes. An [[active voice]] construction would be along the lines of "I made mistakes" or "John Doe made mistakes." The speaker neither accepts personal responsibility nor accuses anyone else. The word "mistakes" also does not imply [[intent (law)|intent]].

''[[The New York Times]]'' has called the phrase a "classic [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] [[Linguistics|linguistic]] construct". Political consultant [[Bill Schneider (journalist)|William Schneider]] suggested this usage be referred to as the "past exonerative" tense,&lt;ref name="broder"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/washington/14mistakes.html | title=Familiar Fallback for Officials: 'Mistakes Were Made' | work=The New York Times | date=13 March 2007 | accessdate=2007-03-20 | author=Broder, John M. | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commentator [[William Safire]] has defined the phrase as "[a] passive-evasive way of acknowledging error while distancing the speaker from responsibility for it".&lt;ref name="Safire"&gt;{{cite book | title=Safire's Political Dictionary | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Safire, William | authorlink=William Safire | year=2008 | isbn=9780195343342 | page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commentator at [[NPR]] declared this expression to be "the king of non-apologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/05/14/183924858/its-true-mistakes-were-made-is-the-king-of-non-apologies|title=It's True: 'Mistakes Were Made' Is The King Of Non-Apologies|last=Memmot|first=Mark|date=May 14, 2013|work=NPR|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While perhaps most famous in politics, the phrase has also been used in business, sports, and entertainment.

===Ifpology===
Attorney and business ethics expert Lauren Bloom, author of ''The Art of the Apology'', mentions the "if apology" as a favorite of politicians, with lines such as "I apologize if I offended anyone".  Comedian [[Harry Shearer]] has coined the term '''Ifpology''' for its frequent appearances on "The Apologies of the Week" segment of ''[[Le Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://techmagazine-821469-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/129608125739/2015-will-be-a-year-of-apologies-maybe-yours | title=2015 Will Be a Year of Apologies.

One of the first references was in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' by Richard Mooney in his 1992 editorial notebook "If This Sounds Slippery ... How to Apologize And Admit Nothing". This was mainly in regard to Senator [[Bob Packwood]]: "Only in the event that someone should choose to take offense, why then he's sorry". Mooney goes on to cite [[Bill Clinton]], who said of [[Mario Cuomo]]: "If the remarks on the tape left anyone with the impression that I was disrespectful to either Governor Cuomo or Italian-Americans, then I deeply regret it." A famous example involved racially insensitive remarks made by golfer [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] about [[Tiger Woods]]; Zoeller's comments and his half-hearted ifpology were news for days and resulted in his being dropped from a commercial tie-in with [[K-Mart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Battistella|first=Edwin L.|title=Sorry about That: The Language of Public Apology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iYY3AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22if+I+offended%22+apology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZSTDU8CoJseAoQSC84DoBg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22if%20I%20offended%22%20apology&amp;f=false|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-930091-4|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Kador in ''Effective Apology'', "Adding the word ''if'' or any other conditional modifier to an apology makes it a non-apology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kador|first=John|title=Effective Apology: Mending Fences, Building Bridges, and Restoring Trust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJ4gQAyfzTUC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=%22if+I+offended%22+apology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZSTDU8CoJseAoQSC84DoBg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22if%20I%20offended%22%20apology&amp;f=false|year=2009|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57675-901-1|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 ifpology was made by ''CNN''{{'}}s [[Don Lemon]], who said, "If my question to her struck anyone as offensive, I am sorry, as that certainly was not my intention." This was in reference to his interview with [[Joan Tarshis]] where he suggested biting a penis as a way to avoid being orally sexually assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Catherine|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/don-lemon-joan-tarshis-bill-cosby-rape|title=CNN Host To Accuser: Why Didn't You Bite Cosby's Penis To End Rape?|publisher=Talking Points Memo|date=November 19, 2014|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2015, [[Matt Damon]] made what ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' termed a "non-apology" apology when he said, "I am sorry that they [his comments] offended some people, but, at the very least, I am happy that they started a conversation about diversity in Hollywood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Paula Young|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/09/17/matt_damon_is_sorry_if_youre_offended_how_the_righteous_non_apology_of_socrates_became_the_tool_of_weasely_pr/|title=Matt Damon is sorry if you're offended: How the righteous non-apology of Socrates became the tool of weasely PR|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=September 17, 2015|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in reference to the backlash against Damon after he made comments about diversity to African American film producer [[Effie Brown]] on the September 13, 2015 debut of the HBO show ''[[Project Greenlight]]'' that were criticized as condescending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosen|first1=Christopher|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/16/matt-damon-project-greenlight-apology|title=Matt Damon apologizes for Project Greenlight diversity comments|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other versions===
On July 24, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported Australian foreign minister Gareth Evans had offered the prime minister of Malaysia "what might best be described as a non-apology apology" for what the Malaysian government regarded as an insulting portrayal of Malaysia in an Australian television series, [[Embassy (TV series)|''Embassy'']].&lt;ref name="Shenon"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/24/world/cliffhanger-down-under-a-soap-opera-huff.html | title=Cliffhanger Down Under: A Soap Opera Huff | work=The New York Times | date=24 July 1991 | accessdate=26 February 2014 | author=Shenon, Philip | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to journalists, Mr Evans said he had "wanted to acknowledge fault where such acknowledgment is appropriate".

=== Sarcastic examples ===
Humorist Bruce McCall, in a 2001 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' piece entitled "The Perfect Non-apology Apology", defined the term as referring to "sufficiently artful [[doublespeak|double talk]]" designed to enable one to "get what you want by seeming to express regret while actually accepting no blame," and suggested some [[tongue-in-cheek]] apologies, such as:

{{quote|Nobody is sorrier than me that the police officer had to spend his valuable time writing out a parking ticket on my car. Though from my personal standpoint I know for a certainty that the meter had not yet expired, please accept my expression of deep regret at this unfortunate incident.&lt;ref name="McCall"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/22/weekinreview/the-perfect-non-apology-apology.html | title=The Perfect Non-Apology Apology | work=The New York Times | date=22 April 2002 | accessdate=26 February 2014 | author=McCall, Bruce | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==As a tactic==

Typologies of apology note they cover a range of situations and degrees of regret, remorse, and contrition, and that success is to be gauged by the result of the apology rather than the degree of contrition involved. Deborah Levi offers the following possibilities:&lt;ref name="Grigsby"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.aamc.org/download/164762/data/grigsby_fine_art_of_apology.pdf | title=The Fine Art of Apology: When, Why, and How to Say ‘I’m Sorry’ | author=Grigsby, R. Kevin | journal=International Journal of Healthcare &amp; Humanities |date=June 2007  | pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Tactical apology—when a person accused of wrongdoing offers an apology that is rhetorical and strategic—and not necessarily heartfelt
* Explanation apology—when a person accused of wrongdoing offers an apology that is merely a gesture that is meant to counter an accusation of wrongdoing. In fact, it may be used to defend the actions of the accused 
* Formalistic apology—when a person accused of wrongdoing offers an apology after being admonished to do so by an authority figure—who may also be the individual who suffered the wrongdoing
* Happy ending apology—when a person accused of wrongdoing fully acknowledges responsibility for the wrongdoing and is genuinely remorseful

While the non-apology apology is clearly unsuited to situations where an expression of remorse, contrition, and future change are obviously desirable (e.g. the "happy ending" apology), it may prove extremely useful in situations where little can be done to assuage the apparent offence or prevent its repetition, as when an airline apologises for a delay, in the full knowledge that a future repetition is inevitable. Such tactical apologies may have beneficial effects simply through the validation of the emotions of the offended party: they answer the basic human need for disagreeable emotions to be recognised and acknowledged as important, while protecting the apparently offending party from an expression of remorse.&lt;ref name="Winch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201106/the-antidote-anger-and-frustration | title=The Antidote to Anger and Frustration | work=Psychology Today | date=18 June 2011 | accessdate=2012-07-18 | author=Winch, Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiators often use this tactic to calm tense situations: "an apology can defuse emotions effectively, even when you do not acknowledge personal responsibility for the action or admit an intention to harm. An apology may be one of the least costly and most rewarding investments you can make."&lt;ref name="Fisher&amp;Ury"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Roger | last1=Fisher | title=[[Getting to YES|Getting to YES: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In]] | publisher=Penguin Book | last2=Ury | first2=William L. | location=New York | isbn=9780140157352 | oclc=24318769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Optical character recognition''' (also '''optical character reader''', '''OCR''') is the [[Machine|mechanical]] or [[Electronics|electronic]] conversion of [[image]]s of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example from a television broadcast).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dev.havenondemand.com/apis/ocrdocument#overview|title=OCR Document|first=HPE Haven|last=OnDemand|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely used as a form of information entry from printed paper data records – whether passport documents, invoices, [[bank statement]]s, computerised receipts, business cards, mail, printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation – it is a common method of digitising printed texts so that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as [[cognitive computing]], [[machine translation]], (extracted) [[text-to-speech]], key data and [[text mining]]. OCR is a field of research in [[pattern recognition]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer vision]].

Early versions needed to be trained with images of each character, and worked on one font at a time. Advanced systems capable of producing a high degree of recognition accuracy for most fonts are now common, and with support for a variety of digital image file format inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dev.havenondemand.com/docs/ImageFormats.html|title=undefined|first=HPE Haven|last=OnDemand|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some systems are capable of reproducing formatted output that closely approximates the original page including images, columns, and other non-textual components.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of optical character recognition}}
Early optical character recognition may be traced to technologies involving telegraphy and creating reading devices for the blind.&lt;ref name=Scantz82&gt;{{cite book|last=Schantz|first=Herbert F.|title=The history of OCR, optical character recognition|year=1982|publisher=Recognition Technologies Users Association|location=[Manchester Center, Vt.]|isbn=9780943072012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, [[Emanuel Goldberg]] developed a machine that read characters and converted them into standard telegraph code.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Concurrently, Edmund Fournier d'Albe developed the [[Optophone]], a handheld scanner that when moved across a printed page, produced tones that corresponded to specific letters or characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=d'Albe|first=E. E. F.|title=On a Type-Reading Optophone|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|date=1 July 1914|volume=90|issue=619|pages=373–375|doi=10.1098/rspa.1914.0061|bibcode=1914RSPSA..90..373D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1920s and into the 1930s [[Emanuel Goldberg]] developed what he called a "Statistical Machine" for searching microfilm archives using an optical code recognition system. In 1931 he was granted USA Patent number 1,838,389 for the invention. The patent was acquired by [[IBM]].

With the advent of smart-phones and [[smartglasses]], OCR can be used in internet connected mobile device applications that extract text captured using the device's camera. These devices that do not have OCR functionality built into the operating system will typically use an OCR [[Application programming interface|API]] to extract the text from the image file captured and provided by the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.havenondemand.com/t5/Blog/Extracting-text-from-images-using-OCR-on-Android/ba-p/1883|title=Extracting text from images using OCR on Android|date=27 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.havenondemand.com/t5/Blog/Tutorial-OCR-on-Google-Glass/ba-p/1164|title=[Tutorial] OCR on Google Glass|date=23 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OCR API returns the extracted text, along with information about the location of the detected text in the original image back to the device app for further processing (such as text-to-speech) or display.

===Blind and visually impaired users===
In 1974, [[Ray Kurzweil]] started the company Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. and continued development of omni-[[typeface|font]] OCR, which could recognise text printed in virtually any font (Kurzweil is often credited with inventing omni-font OCR, but it was in use by companies, including CompuScan, in the late 1960s and 1970s&lt;ref name=Scantz82/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Data processing magazine |title=The History of OCR |volume=12 |year=1970 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Kurzweil decided that the best application of this technology would be to create a reading machine for the blind, which would allow blind people to have a computer read text to them out loud. This device required the invention of two enabling technologies{{spaced ndash}}the [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] [[flatbed scanner]] and the text-to-speech synthesiser. On January 13, 1976, the successful finished product was unveiled during a widely reported news conference headed by Kurzweil and the leaders of the [[National Federation of the Blind]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} In 1978, Kurzweil Computer Products began selling a commercial version of the optical character recognition computer program. [[LexisNexis]] was one of the first customers, and bought the program to upload legal paper and news documents onto its nascent online databases. Two years later, Kurzweil sold his company to [[Xerox]], which had an interest in further commercialising paper-to-computer text conversion. Xerox eventually spun it off as [[Scansoft]], which merged with [[Nuance Communications]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The research group headed by [[A. G. Ramakrishnan]] at the [[Medical intelligence and language engineering lab]], [[Indian Institute of Science]], has developed PrintToBraille tool, an open source GUI frontend&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PrintToBraille Tool |title=ocr-gui-frontend |url=https://code.google.com/p/ocr-gui-frontend/ |publisher=MILE Lab, Dept of EE, IISc |accessdate=7 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225115650/https://code.google.com/p/ocr-gui-frontend/ |archivedate=December 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be used by any OCR to convert scanned images of printed books to Braille books.

In the 2000s, OCR was made available online as a service (WebOCR), in a [[cloud computing]] environment, and in mobile applications like real-time translation of foreign-language signs on a [[smartphone]].

[[Comparison of optical character recognition software|Various commercial and open source OCR systems]] are available for most common [[writing system]]s, including Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, Bengali (Bangla), Devanagari, Tamil, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters.

==Applications==
OCR engines have been developed into many kinds of domain-specific OCR applications, such as receipt OCR, invoice OCR, check OCR, legal billing document OCR.

They can be used for:
* [[Data entry clerk|Data entry]] for business documents, e.g. [[check clearing|check]], passport, invoice, bank statement and receipt
* [[Automatic number plate recognition]]
*In airports, for passport recognition and information extraction
* Automatic insurance documents key information extraction
* Extracting business card information into a contact list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.havenondemand.com/t5/Blog/javascript-Using-OCR-and-Entity-Extraction-for-LinkedIn-Company/ba-p/460|title=[javascript] Using OCR and Entity Extraction for LinkedIn Company Lookup|date=22 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* More quickly make textual versions of printed documents, e.g. [[book scanning]] for [[Project Gutenberg]]
* Make electronic images of printed documents searchable, e.g. [[Google Books]]
* Converting handwriting in real time to control a computer ([[pen computing]])
* Defeating [[CAPTCHA]] anti-bot systems, though these are specifically designed to prevent OCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewt.net/blog/how-to-crack-captchas/ |title=How To Crack Captchas |publisher=andrewt.net |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/research/gimpy/ |title=Breaking a Visual CAPTCHA |publisher=Cs.sfu.ca |date=2002-12-10 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Resig |url=http://ejohn.org/blog/ocr-and-neural-nets-in-javascript/ |title=John Resig – OCR and Neural Nets in JavaScript |publisher=Ejohn.org |date=2009-01-23 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose can also be to test the robustness of CAPTCHA anti-bot systems.
* Assistive technology for blind and visually impaired users

==Types==
* Optical character recognition (OCR){{spaced ndash}}targets typewritten text, one [[glyph]] or [[character (symbol)|character]] at a time.
* Optical word recognition{{spaced ndash}}targets typewritten text, one word at a time (for languages that use a [[Space (punctuation)|space]] as a [[word divider]]).  (Usually just called "OCR".)
* [[Intelligent character recognition]] (ICR){{spaced ndash}}also targets handwritten [[printscript]] or [[cursive]] text one glyph or character at a time, usually involving [[machine learning]].
* [[Intelligent word recognition]] (IWR){{spaced ndash}}also targets handwritten [[printscript]] or [[cursive]] text, one word at a time.  This is especially useful for languages where glyphs are not separated in cursive script.

OCR is generally an "offline" process, which analyses a static document. [[Handwriting movement analysis]] can be used as input to [[handwriting recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tappert | first1 = C. C. | last2 = Suen | first2 = C. Y. | last3 = Wakahara | first3 = T. | doi = 10.1109/34.57669 | title = The state of the art in online handwriting recognition | journal = IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence | volume = 12 | issue = 8 | pages = 787 | year = 1990 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of merely using the shapes of glyphs and words, this technique is able to capture motions, such as the order in which [[Segment (handwriting)|segments]] are drawn, the direction, and the pattern of putting the pen down and lifting it.  This additional information can make the end-to-end process more accurate.  This technology is also known as "on-line character recognition", "dynamic character recognition", "real-time character recognition", and "intelligent character recognition".

==Techniques==

===Pre-processing===
OCR software often "pre-processes" images to improve the chances of successful recognition. Techniques include:&lt;ref name="nicomsoft"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nicomsoft.com/optical-character-recognition-ocr-how-it-works/ |title=Optical Character Recognition (OCR) – How it works |publisher=Nicomsoft.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* De-[[Skew (fax)|skew]]{{spaced ndash}}If the document was not aligned properly when scanned, it may need to be tilted a few degrees clockwise or counterclockwise in order to make lines of text perfectly horizontal or vertical.
* [[Despeckle]]{{spaced ndash}}remove positive and negative spots, smoothing edges
* Binarisation{{spaced ndash}}Convert an image from color or [[greyscale]] to black-and-white (called a "[[binary image]]" because there are two colours). The task of binarisation is performed as a simple way of separating the text (or any other desired image component) from the background.&lt;ref name=Sezgin2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sezgin|first1=Mehmet|last2=Sankur|first2=Bulent|title=Survey over image thresholding techniques and quantitative performance evaluation|journal=Journal of Electronic imaging|date=2004|volume=13|issue=1|page=146|url=http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~nray1/CMPUT605/track3_papers/Threshold_survey.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2015|bibcode=2004JEI....13..146S|doi=10.1117/1.1631315}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task of binarisation itself is necessary since most commercial recognition algorithms work only on binary images since it proves to be simpler to do so.&lt;ref name=Gupta2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=Maya R.|last2=Jacobson|first2=Nathaniel P.|last3=Garcia|first3=Eric K.|title=OCR binarisation and image pre-processing for searching historical documents.|journal=Pattern Recognition|date=2007|volume=40|issue=2|page=389|url=http://www.rfai.li.univ-tours.fr/fr/ressources/_dh/DOC/DocOCR/OCRbinarisation.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2015|doi=10.1016/j.patcog.2006.04.043}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the effectiveness of the binarisation step influences to a significant extent the quality of the character recognition stage and the careful decisions are made in the choice of the binarisation employed for a given input image type; since the quality of the binarisation method employed to obtain the binary result depends on the type of the input image (scanned document, scene text image, historical degraded document etc.).&lt;ref name=Trier1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trier|first1=Oeivind Due|last2=Jain|first2=Anil K.|title=Goal-directed evaluation of binarisation methods.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|date=1995|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1191–1201|url=http://heim.ifi.uio.no/inf386/trier2.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2015|doi=10.1109/34.476511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Milyaev2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milyaev|first1=Sergey|last2=Barinova|first2=Olga|last3=Novikova|first3=Tatiana|last4=Kohli|first4=Pushmeet|last5=Lempitsky|first5=Victor|title=Image binarisation for end-to-end text understanding in natural images.|journal=Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR) 2013|date=2013|volume=12th International Conference on|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/pkohli/papers/mbnlk_icdar2013.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Line removal{{spaced ndash}}Cleans up non-glyph boxes and lines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grooper.com/image-optimization.html|title=Image Optimization|last=|first=|date=September 20, 2018|website=Grooper Document Capture|at=Bottom of the web page|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Document Layout Analysis|Layout analysis]] or "zoning"{{spaced ndash}}Identifies columns, paragraphs, captions, etc. as distinct blocks.  Especially important in [[Column (typography)|multi-column layouts]] and [[Table (information)|tables]].
* Line and word detection{{spaced ndash}}Establishes baseline for word and character shapes, separates words if necessary.
* Script recognition{{spaced ndash}}In multilingual documents, the script may change at the level of the words and hence, identification of the script is necessary, before the right OCR can be invoked to handle the specific script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference  | last1=Pati  | first1=P.B.  | last2= Ramakrishnan    |  first2=A.G.  |  title = Word Level Multi-script Identification  | date =1987-05-29  | journal=Pattern Recognition Letters, Vol. 29, pp. 1218 - 1229, 2008 | doi=10.1016/j.patrec.2008.01.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Character isolation or "segmentation"{{spaced ndash}}For per-character OCR, multiple characters that are connected due to image artifacts must be separated; single characters that are broken into multiple pieces due to artifacts must be connected.
* Normalise [[aspect ratio]] and [[Scale (ratio)|scale]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.damiles.com/2008/11/20/basic-ocr-in-opencv.html |title=Basic OCR in OpenCV &amp;#124; Damiles |publisher=Blog.damiles.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Segmentation of [[fixed-pitch font]]s is accomplished relatively simply by aligning the image to a uniform grid based on where vertical grid lines will least often intersect black areas.  For [[proportional font]]s, more sophisticated techniques are needed because whitespace between letters can sometimes be greater than that between words, and vertical lines can intersect more than one character.&lt;ref name="Tesseract overview" /&gt;

===Character recognition===
There are two basic types of core OCR algorithm, which may produce a ranked list of candidate characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dataid.com/aboutocr.htm |title=OCR Introduction |publisher=Dataid.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matrix matching involves comparing an image to a stored glyph on a pixel-by-pixel basis; it is also known as "pattern matching", "[[pattern recognition]]", or "[[digital image correlation|image correlation]]". This relies on the input glyph being correctly isolated from the rest of the image, and on the stored glyph being in a similar font and at the same scale.  This technique works best with typewritten text and does not work well when new fonts are encountered.  This is the technique the early physical photocell-based OCR implemented, rather directly.

Feature extraction decomposes glyphs into "features" like lines, closed loops, line direction, and line intersections.  The extraction features reduces the dimensionality of the representation and makes the recognition process computationally efficient. These features are compared with an abstract vector-like representation of a character, which might reduce to one or more glyph prototypes.  General techniques of [[Feature detection (computer vision)|feature detection in computer vision]] are applicable to this type of OCR, which is commonly seen in "intelligent" [[handwriting recognition]] and indeed most modern OCR software.&lt;ref name="ocrwizard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocrwizard.com/ocr-software/how-ocr-software-works.html |title=How OCR Software Works |publisher=OCRWizard |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nearest neighbour classifiers]] such as the [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm]] are used to compare image features with stored glyph features and choose the nearest match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.damiles.com/2008/11/14/the-basic-patter-recognition-and-classification-with-opencv.html |title=The basic pattern recognition and classification with openCV &amp;#124; Damiles |publisher=Blog.damiles.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software such as [[CuneiForm (software)|Cuneiform]] and [[Tesseract (software)|Tesseract]] use a two-pass approach to character recognition.  The second pass is known as "adaptive recognition" and uses the letter shapes recognised with high confidence on the first pass to recognise better the remaining letters on the second pass.  This is advantageous for unusual fonts or low-quality scans where the font is distorted (e.g. blurred or faded).&lt;ref name="Tesseract overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/tesseracticdar2007.pdf|title=An Overview of the Tesseract OCR Engine|year=2007|accessdate=2013-05-23|author=Ray Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OCR result can be stored in the standardised [[ALTO (XML)|ALTO]] format, a dedicated XML schema maintained by the United States [[Library of Congress]].

For a list of optical character recognition software see [[Comparison of optical character recognition software]].

===Post-processing===
OCR accuracy can be increased if the output is constrained by a [[lexicon]]{{spaced ndash}}a list of words that are allowed to occur in a document.&lt;ref name="nicomsoft" /&gt;  This might be, for example, all the words in the English language, or a more technical lexicon for a specific field.  This technique can be problematic if the document contains words not in the lexicon, like [[proper noun]]s. Tesseract uses its dictionary to influence the character segmentation step, for improved accuracy.&lt;ref name="Tesseract overview" /&gt;

The output stream may be a [[plain text]] stream or file of characters, but more sophisticated OCR systems can preserve the original layout of the page and produce, for example, an annotated [[PDF]] that includes both the original image of the page and a searchable textual representation.

"Near-neighbor analysis" can make use of [[co-occurrence]] frequencies to correct errors, by noting that certain words are often seen together.&lt;ref name="explain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explainthatstuff.com/how-ocr-works.html |title=How does OCR document scanning work? |publisher=Explain that Stuff |date=2012-01-30 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, "Washington, D.C." is generally far more common in English than "Washington DOC".

Knowledge of the grammar of the language being scanned can also help determine if a word is likely to be a verb or a noun, for example, allowing greater accuracy.

The [[Levenshtein distance|Levenshtein Distance]] algorithm has also been used in OCR post-processing to further optimize results from an OCR API.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.havenondemand.com/t5/Wiki/How-to-optimize-results-from-the-OCR-API-when-extracting-text/ta-p/1656|title=How to optimize results from the OCR API when extracting text from an image? - Haven OnDemand Developer Community|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application-specific optimisations===
In recent years,{{when|date=March 2013}} the major OCR technology providers began to tweak OCR systems to better deal with specific types of input.  Beyond an application-specific lexicon, better performance can be had by taking into account business rules, standard expression,{{clarify|date=March 2013}} or rich information contained in color images.  This strategy is called "Application-Oriented OCR" or "Customised OCR", and has been applied to OCR of [[license plate]]s, [[invoice]]s, [[screenshot]]s, [[ID card]]s, [[driver license]]s, and [[automobile manufacturing]].

==Workarounds==
There are several techniques for solving the problem of character recognition by means other than improved OCR algorithms.

===Forcing better input===
Special fonts like [[OCR-A font|OCR-A]], [[OCR-B]], or [[MICR]] fonts, with precisely specified sizing, spacing, and distinctive character shapes, allow a higher accuracy rate during transcription in bank check processing. Ironically however, several prominent OCR engines were designed to capture text in popular fonts such as Arial or Times New Roman, and are incapable of capturing text in these fonts that are specialized and much different from popularly used fonts. As Google Tesseract can be trained to recognize new fonts, it can recognize OCR-A, OCR-B and MICR fonts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trainyourtesseract.com/|title=Train Your Tesseract|last=|first=|date=September 20, 2018|website=Train Your Tesseract|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

"Comb fields" are pre-printed boxes that encourage humans to write more legibly{{spaced ndash}}one glyph per box.&lt;ref name="explain" /&gt;  These are often printed in a [[Drop out ink|"dropout color"]] which can be easily removed by the OCR system.&lt;ref name="explain" /&gt;

[[Palm OS]] used a special set of glyphs, known as "[[Graffiti (Palm OS)|Graffiti]]" which are similar to printed English characters but simplified or modified for easier recognition on the platform's computationally limited hardware. Users would need to learn how to write these special glyphs.

Zone-based OCR restricts the image to a specific part of a document.  This is often referred to as "Template OCR".

===Crowdsourcing===
[[Crowdsourcing]] humans to perform the character recognition can quickly process images like computer-driven OCR, but with higher accuracy for recognising images than is obtained with computers.  Practical systems include the [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] and [[reCAPTCHA]]. The [[National Library of Finland]] has developed an online interface for users correct OCRed texts in the standardised ALTO format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.helsinki.fi/fennougrica/2014/02/21/ocr-text-editor/|title=What is the point of an online interactive OCR text editor? - Fenno-Ugrica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowdsourcing has also been used not to perform character recognition directly but to invite software developers to develop image processing algorithms, for example, through the use of [[Tournament theory|rank-order tournaments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Riedl, C. |author2=Zanibbi, R. |author3=Hearst, M. A. |author4=Zhu, S. |author5=Menietti, M. |author6=Crusan, J. |author7=Metelsky, I. |author8=Lakhani, K. |title=Detecting Figures and Part Labels in Patents: Competition-Based Development of Image Processing Algorithms |journal=[[International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=155 |date=20 February 2016 |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10032-016-0260-8 |bibcode= |doi=10.1007/s10032-016-0260-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy==
{{update|date=March 2013}}
Commissioned by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE), the Information Science Research Institute (ISRI) had the mission to foster the improvement of automated technologies for understanding machine printed documents, and it conducted the most authoritative of the ''Annual Test of OCR Accuracy'' from 1992 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/isri-ocr-evaluation-tools/|title= Code and Data to evaluate OCR accuracy, originally from UNLV/ISRI|publisher=Google Code Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognition of [[Latin alphabet|Latin-script]], typewritten text is still not 100% accurate even where clear imaging is available. One study based on recognition of 19th- and early 20th-century newspaper pages concluded that character-by-character OCR accuracy for commercial OCR software varied from 81% to 99%;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; total accuracy can be achieved by human review or Data Dictionary Authentication. Other areas—including recognition of hand printing, [[cursive]] handwriting, and printed text in other scripts (especially those East Asian language characters which have many strokes for a single character)—are still the subject of active research. The [[MNIST database]] is commonly used for testing systems' ability to recognise handwritten digits.

Accuracy rates can be measured in several ways, and how they are measured can greatly affect the reported accuracy rate. For example, if word context (basically a lexicon of words) is not used to correct software finding non-existent words, a character error rate of 1% (99% accuracy) may result in an error rate of 5% (95% accuracy) or worse if the measurement is based on whether each whole word was recognised with no incorrect letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference  | last1=Suen  | first1=C.Y.  | last2= Plamondon    |  first2=R.  | last3= Tappert  | first3=A.  | last4=Thomassen  | first4=A.  | last5=Ward  | first5=J.R.  | last6=Yamamoto  | first6=K.  | title = Future Challenges in Handwriting and Computer Applications  | date =1987-05-29  | conference=3rd International Symposium on Handwriting and Computer Applications, Montreal, May 29, 1987  | url=http://users.erols.com/rwservices/pens/biblio88.html#Suen88  | accessdate = 2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the difficulties inherent in digitising old text is the inability of OCR to differentiate between the "[[long s]]" and "f" characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries|author=Sarantos Kapidakis, Cezary Mazurek, Marcin Werla|date=2015|page=257|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319245928|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kEyGCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=OCR+and+long+s&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Web-based OCR systems for recognising hand-printed text on the fly have become well known as commercial products in recent years{{when|date=March 2013}} (see [[tablet computer|Tablet PC history]]). Accuracy rates of 80% to 90% on neat, clean hand-printed characters can be achieved by [[pen computing]] software, but that accuracy rate still translates to dozens of errors per page, making the technology useful only in very limited applications.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Recognition of cursive text is an active area of research, with recognition rates even lower than that of hand-printed text. Higher rates of recognition of general cursive script will likely not be possible without the use of contextual or grammatical information. For example, recognising entire words from a dictionary is easier than trying to parse individual characters from script. Reading the ''Amount'' line of a [[cheque]] (which is always a written-out number) is an example where using a smaller dictionary can increase recognition rates greatly. The shapes of individual cursive characters themselves simply do not contain enough information to accurately (greater than 98%) recognise all handwritten cursive script.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} 

Most programs allow users to set "confidence rates". This means that if the software does not achieve their desired level of accuracy, a user can be notified for manual review.

==UNICODE==
{{Main article|Optical Character Recognition (Unicode block)}}

Characters to support OCR were added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in June 1993, with the release of version 1.1.

Some of these characters are mapped from fonts specific to [[MICR]], [[OCR-A]] or [[OCR-B]].

'''PetriScript''' is a [[modeling language]] for [[Petri net]]s, designed by Alexandre Hamez and Xavier Renault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alexandre Hamez|author2=Xavier Renault|title=PetriScript Reference Manual 1.0|url=https://www.lip6.fr/cpn-ami-doc/PetriScript_Reference_Manual.pdf|publisher=LIP6|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024090820/http://move.lip6.fr/software/DOWNLOADS/CPN-AMI/PetriScript_Reference_Manual.pdf|archivedate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CPN-AMI]] [[Platform (computing)|platform]] provides many tools to work on Petri nets, such as verifying and model-checking tools.&lt;ref&gt;Principles of Information Systems: Computer science&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, simple Petri nets were created through [[graphic design]], but research conducted internally at [[Laboratoire d'Informatique de Paris 6|LIP6]] revealed that it was needed to automate such tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Business Database Systems: Computer science, Database management&lt;/ref&gt; PetriScript was designed to provide some facilities in modeling places-transition and coloured Petri nets within the CPN-AMI platform. Petriscript's main purpose is to automate modeling operations on Petri nets by merging, creating, and connecting [[Node (computer science)|nodes]]. It supports almost everything needed, such as [[macro (computer science)|macro]]s, loops control, lists, and [[String (computer science)|string]] and [[arithmetic expression]]s, and blocks intervention of the user as much as possible. Its syntax is [[Ada (programming language)|Ada-like]].

The following [[Script (computer programming)|script]] produces a FIFO with three sections:
&lt;source lang="ada"&gt;
 define(FIFO_SIZE,3)
 define(FIFO_BASE_X,100)
 define(FIFO_BASE_Y,100)
 define(FIFO_STEP,120)
 int $wave := 0;
 for $wave in 1..FIFO_SIZE loop
 	create place "Slot_" &amp; '$wave' (x FIFO_BASE_X + FIFO_STEP * $wave,
 		y FIFO_BASE_Y);
 	create place "Empty_" &amp; '$wave' (x FIFO_BASE_X + FIFO_STEP * $wave,
 		y FIFO_BASE_Y + 100, marking "1");
 end loop;
 for $wave in 1..FIFO_SIZE+1 loop
 	create transition "t" &amp; '$wave -1' &amp; "_to_" &amp; '$wave' (x FIFO_BASE_X + FIFO_STEP * $wave - FIFO_STEP / 2,
 		y FIFO_BASE_Y + 50);
 	if $wave &lt; FIFO_SIZE+1 then
 		connect "1" transition "t" &amp;'$wave -1' &amp; "_to_" &amp; '$wave' to  place "Slot_" &amp; '$wave';
 		connect "1" place "Empty_" &amp; '$wave' to transition "t" &amp;'$wave -1' &amp; "_to_" &amp; '$wave';
 	end if;
 	if $wave &gt; 1 then
 		connect "1" transition "t" &amp;'$wave -1' &amp; "_to_" &amp; '$wave' to  place "Empty_" &amp; '$wave - 1';
 		connect "1" place "Slot_" &amp; '$wave - 1' to transition "t" &amp;'$wave -1' &amp; "_to_" &amp; '$wave';
 	end if;
 end loop;
 set transition "t0_to_1" to (name "FIFO_Start");
 set transition "t" &amp;  'FIFO_SIZE' &amp; "_to_" &amp; 'FIFO_SIZE + 1' to (name "FIFO_End");
&lt;/source&gt;
Which produces the following [[Graph (computer science)|graph]]:

Here is another example that shows the power of PetriScript:
&lt;source lang="ada"&gt;
 define(X,250)
 define(Y,350)
 define(radius,50)
 define(R,150)
 
 define(SECTIONS,15)
 
 define(INNER_ANGLE,360/SECTIONS)
 define(OUTER_ANGLE,360/(2*SECTIONS))
 
 int $i := 0;
 int $j := 0;
 
 for $i in 1.. SECTIONS loop
 	create place "F" &amp; '$i' ( x X, y Y, r radius, t $i * INNER_ANGLE);
 	create place "Section_" &amp; '$i' ( x X, y Y,  r R, t $i * INNER_ANGLE);
 	create transition "t" &amp; '$i' &amp; "_to_" &amp; '$i mod SECTIONS + 1' ( x X, y Y, r R, t $i * INNER_ANGLE + OUTER_ANGLE);
 end loop;
 
 
 for $i in 1.. SECTIONS loop
 	connect place "Section_" &amp; '$i'  to transition "t"&amp;'$i' &amp; "_to_" &amp; '$i mod SECTIONS + 1';
 
 	connect transition "t" &amp; '$i' &amp; "_to_" &amp; '$i mod SECTIONS + 1' to place "Section_" &amp; '$i mod SECTIONS + 1';
 
 	if $i /= 1 then
 		connect place "F" &amp; '$i'  to transition "t" &amp; '$i-1' &amp; "_to_" &amp; '$i';
 	else
 		connect place "F1"  to transition "t" &amp; 'SECTIONS' &amp; "_to_" &amp; '1';
 	end if;
 	
 	connect transition "t" &amp;'$i mod SECTIONS + 1' &amp; "_to_" &amp; '($i+1) mod SECTIONS + 1' to place "F" &amp; '$i';
 
 end loop;
 
 for $i in 1.. SECTIONS loop
 	if $i mod 3 = 0 then
 		set place "Section_" &amp; '$i' to marking "1";
 	else
 		set place "F" &amp; '$i' to marking "1";
 	end if;
 end loop;
&lt;/source&gt;
Which produces the following graph:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34175">{{short description|A social network game played on a two-dimensional matrix}}
The '''Poietic Generator''' is a [[social-network game]] designed by [[Olivier Auber]]&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Auber, independent researcher, member dof the research cluster of the [http://p2pfoundation.net P2P foundation], affiliated since 2012 to the interdisciplinary research group [http://ecco.vub.ac.be/?q=node/30 "Evolution, Complexity and COgnition" (ECCO), Vrije Universiteit Brussel] and to the [http://globalbraininstitute.org Global Brain Institute].&lt;/ref&gt; in 1986, and developed from 1987 under the label [[free art]]&lt;ref&gt;Prior the free art license (2000), the Poietic Generator had its own free license: https://web.archive.org/web/20020605145918/http://perso.enst.fr/~auber/sommaireA.html#statut.&lt;/ref&gt; thanks to many contributors.&lt;ref&gt;Poietic Generator's contributors : http://poietic-generator.net/blog/?page_id=91.&lt;/ref&gt; The game takes place within a two-dimensional matrix in the tradition of [[board games]] and its principle is similar to both [[Conway's Game of Life]] and the [[Surrealism|surrealists]]' [[Exquisite corpse]].

However, it differs from these models in several respects. It is not an algorithm like Conway's, but human players who control in real time the graphic elements of a global matrix, on the basis of one unit per person. Unlike the exquisite corpse, in which there are always hidden parts, here all the players' actions are visible at all times by each of them. Unlike [[board games]], there is no concept of winning or losing, the goal of the game is simply to collectively draw recognizable forms and to observe how we create them together.

The name "Poietic Generator", derived from the concept of [[autopoiesis]] in life sciences ([[Francisco Varela]]), and of [[poietic]] in philosophy of art ([[Paul Valéry]], [[:fr:René Passeron|René Passeron]] {{fr}}), illustrates the process of [[self-organization]] at work in the continuous emergence of the global picture. Since its inception, the Poietic Generator has been designed as part of a wider [[action research]] to create an "Art of Speed".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://nideffer.net/proj/_SPEED_/1.4/articles/auber.html Esquisse d'une position théorique pour un art de la vitesse]'', Olivier Auber, SPEED 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules of the game ==
&lt;blockquote&gt; Every player draws on a small part of a global mosaic formed by the dynamic juxtaposition of those parts, which are manipulated by all the participants (eventually it will be possible for several thousand players to play simultaneously). Every player can therefore change the sign in his/her square, depending on the overall state of the image, which itself depends on the actions of all the individual players. Out of this cybernetic loop emerges a kind of narrative: autonomous forms, sometimes abstract, sometimes figurative, appear in a completely unpredictable manner and tell stories.&lt;ref name="Olivier Auber"&gt;Olivier Auber, in [http://www.kisskissbankbank.com/fr/projects/generateur-poietique/news/poietic-generator-reloaded-l-aventure-peut-re-commencer ''Poietic Generator reloaded, l'aventure peut (re)commencer !'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In practice, each player can draw (using a graphics tablet) on a very simple image. This image is limited in size (20×20 [[pixels]]) by design. This was done to prevent a single player from drawing figurative signs by himself. The overall image is continuously formed in the style of a spiral, that is to say the sign of the first player occupies the whole image, and the signs of the newcomers are juxtaposed in the first winding around it, and so on. If a player forfeits the game, his/her sign immediately disappears and its position remains empty until another player occupies it. A zoom in/zoom out feature ensures that the image constituted by the juxtaposition of all signs, is permanently visible to all the players.

== Versions ==
The Poietic Generator runs on two types of architecture, a centralized network (for versions 1, 3, 4), or an ''[[Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector|ad hoc]]'' distributed network capable of implementing the [[multicast]] protocol (case version 2). Therefore, no location in the network plays a particular role and according to the rules of the Poietic Generator, an "all-all" interaction may take place without the intervention of any kind of control center.

== Experiments ==
Since 1987, the Poietic Generator (various versions) inspired many experiments in diverse contexts. The first public experiment was at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in 1990 as part of the "Communication and monumentality" exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;The exhibition "Communication and monumentality" ([[Centre Georges Pompidou]], 1990) presented the seven laureates of the ''France-Japon Symbol'' contest launched by [[:fr:Philippe Quéau|Philippe Quéau]]. The Poietic Generator was one of them: [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1510/is_n62/ai_7422483/ Charles Lenay "The poietic generator - interactive telecommunication artwork".

Several experiments were performed on the periphery of academic research. For instance, experiments were conducted in particular at [[Telecom ParisTech]] (where Olivier Auber was a guest artist between 1994 and 1997), during the Internet [[Mbone]] experiment (with [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] and Xerox PARC), and at other laboratories. The subjects of the experiments were diverse: network protocols, the process of emergence of forms, human-machine interfaces, collective intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;''ProspecTic, nouvelles technologies, nouvelles pensées'', Jean-Michel Cornu, FING &amp; Fyp Editions, oct. 2008. ([http://perspective-numerique.net/wakka.php?wiki=ProspecTic Web])&lt;/ref&gt; group behavior,&lt;ref&gt;Elisa Giaccardi, Center for LifeLong Learning and Design (L3D), Department of Computer Science and Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Colorado : ''Mediators in Visual Interaction: An Analysis of the “Poietic Generator” and “Open Studio”'' ([http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/~giaccard/research/pdf/Giaccardi_JVLC05.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

Since 1997, the Poietic Generator is accessible to everyone on the web as a work of [[free art]] (under [[Free Art License]] from 2002). At the request of various groups of artists, teachers or researchers, this led to several hundred recorded&lt;ref&gt;Some records: [http://perspective-numerique.net/wakka.php?wiki=GenerateurPoietiqueVideos (perspective-numerique.net)]&lt;/ref&gt; game sessions, some of them commented.&lt;ref&gt;Some comments: [http://www.transactiv-exe.org/spip.php?article98 (Transactiv.exe)]&lt;/ref&gt; In several of these sessions, 70 players participated simultaneously. Several experiments were in kindergarten, elementary and secondary schools (including one experiment linking multiple classrooms).

The most recent event was in the spring of 2011 when 70 people responded to a call on the  [[France Culture]] radio station&lt;ref&gt;France-Culture, [http://www.franceculture.fr/emission-place-de-la-toile-agriculture-machines-et-reseaux-generateur-poietique-2011-04-10.html ''Place de la Toile'', 2011.04.10] ([http://perspective-numerique.net/wakka.php?wiki=PlaceDeLaToile10042011 Audio])&lt;/ref&gt; to finance the mobile version of the Poietic Generator via the crowd-funded platform&lt;ref&gt;.

Note that the Poietic Generator was born at the time of [[Minitel]], before the invention of the Web (1994), and implemented from 1995 onwards on experimental [[Multicast]] networks foreshadowing [[IPv6]]. The introduction of the Minitel in France, offered, for the first time in the world, an easy way to implement [[telematic art]]. Several French artists attempted somewhat similar experiments,&lt;ref&gt;Example of [[telematic art]] using [[Minitel]] : ''Image-la-Vallée'', vitrail monumental dessiné collectivement par minitel, (Jean-Claude Anglade) 1987. ([http://jean.claude.anglade.free.fr/ Web])&lt;/ref&gt; but none of them had the durability of Poietic Generator.

[[:fr:Anne Cauquelin|Anne Cauquelin]], who deals with the mechanisms of the "system of art" in several of her works,&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Anne Cauquelin|Anne Cauquelin]]: ''Fréquenter les incorporels'', PUF, collection « Lignes d'art », 2006. ''Que sais-je ? L’art contemporain'', PUF, 9eme édition, mai 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; considers the Poietic Generator to be the prototype of a new "cognitive art". This new "cognitive art", following [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Andy Warhol]], re-institutes the task of questioning again, and in a more radical way, the "[[doxa]] of art".
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like in the Renaissance, art becomes (a) heuristic, a type of probe with the task to explore a continent.&lt;ref name="Anne Cauquelin"&gt;[[:fr:Anne Cauquelin|Anne Cauquelin]], à propros of  "cognitive art" in ''L'art contemporain'', PUF (2009), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since 1987, the Poietic Generator directly inspired multiple variations and derivative works. Some of them developed by its original author&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Auber, derivative works of the Poietic Generator: ''[http://wiki.km2.net/wakka.php?wiki=FranceJaponReseau L'Anneau France-Japon, 1988]'' (lauréat du concours du symbole France-Japon, Paris-Kobé, 1988), ''[http://wiki.km2.net/wakka.php?wiki=Schatz Le Trésor des Nibelungen, 2001]'' ([http://km2.net/aplush/nibelungenmuseum/presse/BostonGlobe/BostonGlobe.htm Boston CyberArt 2001], [http://www.liberation.fr/guide/0101356321-tragedies-en-sous-sol ISEA 2001], [http://km2.net/aplush/nibelungenmuseum/communique/sommaire.htm NibelungenMuseum, Worms 2001]), ''[http://arbe.km2.net @rbre (open collective memory), 2000]'' ([http://www.francegenweb.org/blog/index.php?post/2006/05/13/138-l-rbre-un-nouvelle-representation-graphique-de-la-genealogie Tourouvre 2006, Québec 2008]), ''[http://wiki.km2.net/wakka.php?wiki=InvisibleMonument L’Invisible Monument, 2002]'' ([http://km2.net/IMG/jpg/libe10-05-2003-.jpg Metz, 2003])&lt;/ref&gt; based on his own research process,&lt;ref&gt;Elen S.

== Theoretical aspects ==

=== Modelling ===
Jean-Paul Fourmentraux, in his classification&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Fourmentraux, ''[http://tc.revues.org/2872 Les Dispositifs du Net Art]'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Net.art]] devices, quotes the Poietic Generator as one of the few representatives of the "alteraction" devices category. These type of devices support processes of pure synchronous human communication, free from algorithmic control or introduction of external data. This alteraction process, envisioned as "an intermediate action which makes one become other"&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Philippe Quéau|Philippe Quéau]] : ''Metaxu : théorie de l'art intermédiaire'', Editions Champ Vallon, 1989 - 337 pages&lt;/ref&gt; ([[:fr:Philippe Quéau|Philippe Quéau]]), lies outside the field studied by the general [[theory of games]], as its branch covering multiplayer games ([[coordination game]]s, [[cooperative game]]s) which does not consider the [[emergence]] of meta-levels: specifically the "becoming other". According to testimony, the Poietic Generator has an amazing ability to immerse its players in a learning process of social phenomena: it gives not only the possibility to live a kind of "conversation", but in some degree, to access to its model by observing and interpreting autopoietic phenomena, that is to say the "life", which takes place there. According to Olivier Auber, there would be in the Poietic Generator, intrusion of eigenfrequencies, similar to those existing in other autopoietic systems (cell, cerebral cortex, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Jean Petitot, [http://jean.petitot.pagesperso-orange.fr/JPmodeles.html ''Modèles dynamiques en Sciences cognitives'']&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their apparent complexity, these temporal phenomena (oscillations between structure and chaos, complexity and simplicity) could be analyzed, even "mathematised",&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Auber : [http://perspective-numerique.net/PDF/RecherchePerspectivesAnoptiques.pdf ''Perspectives anoptiques : théorie et applications'' PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the light of the [[simplicity theory]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simplicitytheory.org/ ''simplicity theory'' ([[Jean-Louis Dessalles]], Telecom Paristech, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08657 Saillenfest, A., Dessalles, J-L., Auber, O. (2016). Role of Simplicity in Creative Behaviour: The Case of the Poietic Generator. Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC-2016). Paris, France. (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Jean-Louis Dessalles]]). Structuring phases corresponds to a "becoming other" (Quéau) and a greater "simplicity" (Dessalles). The emergence of these kinds of paradigm shifts would be both unexpected and [[determinism|deterministic]].

=== Perspectives ===
The Poietic Generator may be seen as a generic model&lt;ref&gt;Lenay, C. (1988): ''Création collective et émergence de signes : l'oeuvre d'Olivier Auber'', published in  Actes du séminaire interdisciplinaire de Sciences Cognitives et Epistémologie "Genèse des Représentations" - 01/1995 - p. 139-148, online on [https://www.academia.edu/31940266/Cr%C3%A9ation_collective_et_%C3%A9mergence_de_signes Academia]&lt;/ref&gt; of multiple complex systems (informational, urban, economic, ecological, etc.) to which everyone is confronted daily. But unlike these systems, often opaque about their prerequisites, their rules and infrastructure, the Poietic Generator is perfectly transparent: "everything is known or knowable",&lt;ref name="Olivier Auber"/&gt; in particular the fact that it operates either centrally or without any center. According to Olivier Auber,&lt;ref&gt;As discussed by Inge Hinterwaldner in ''The Systemic Image: A New Theory of Interactive Real-Time Simulations'', MIT Press (2016) - p. 28, 29, 283, 326, 327, 386. Available on [https://books.google.com/books?id=XT3mDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA326&amp;lpg=PA326&amp;dq=%22Du+%22g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rateur+po%C3%AF%C3%A9tique%22+%C3%A0+la+perspective+num%C3%A9rique%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=luXR2A3N6V&amp;sig=dFahWS0MJh1kq9-vlh4UjZ7zSek&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Auber&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; these two architectures, centered or not, are achieving some forms of "[[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]" (within the meaning of the Renaissance) in which the vanishing point lies, in the first case, in a physical center (the server), in the second in a "code" under cover of which the network is sharing information (its sign of recognition in some way). He speaks in the first case of a "temporal perspective" because it is in the center where emerges moment by moment the "proper time" of the network (its rhythmic pulsations). In the second case, he speaks of a "digital perspective"&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Auber : ''Du Générateur poïétique à la perspective numérique'', Revue d'esthétique 43 - 07/2003 - p. 127, online on [http://archee.qc.ca/ar.php?page=imp&amp;no=207 Archée, Québec], "The Aestetic of the Digital Perspective", Artmedia VIII,
Paris, 2002 ([http://vv.arts.ucla.edu/publications/publications/02-03/Artmedia/PARTICIPANTSe.htm arts.ucla.edu])&lt;/ref&gt;  because it is a "code" (an arbitrary number) which is the guarantor of the emergence of the proper time of the network in each of its nodes. These two perspectives are of course not visual as is the case of the spatial perspective, but they share with it some topological and symbolic attributes. In particular, one can speak of "legitimate perspective", as [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] did in the [[Renaissance]]. The Poietic Generator as an [[Ideal city]], implements these two non-visual perspectives, described by Oliver Auber "anoptical perspectives," as perfectly and obvious as possible. Throughout the game, players can gradually take a cognitive step back, and by analogy grasp in thought the nature of the perspectives in question. The hypothesis of Olivier Auber is that these perspectives are exercised within the framework of "real" systems, opaque and complex as mentioned above, and that they shape the imagination and judgment, that is to say the [[doxa]] of those who are enrolled in it.

In attempting to uncover the "anoptical perspectives", the Poietic Generator positions itself as a [[metagaming|metagame]] which invites a questioning of the processes of social interaction, especially when they are mediated by technological devices interacting with [[social networks]].&lt;ref&gt;De nouvelles perspectives pour les « réseaux sociaux ?», conférence dans les cadre des « Entretiens du nouveau monde industriel », Centre Georges Pompidou, 4 octobre 2008 ([http://amateur.iri.centrepompidou.fr/nouveaumonde/enmi/ldt/index/xolivierauber vidéo])&lt;/ref&gt; For Olivier Auber, the Poietic Generator, as a model and experience available to all, could contribute to "a certain conceptual knowledge (dianoia) of how the doxa is formed and exercised on us, especially through technology". At a time when technical objects are close to the body and are preparing to invade it, the Poietic Generator could help us by providing "a set of conceptual tools for the new "perspecteurs" ([[Abraham Bosse]]) that we could all become" in order, he says, to "rethink the imagination of the technology in full light".&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Auber : Perspectives anoptiques : théorie et applications, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception by the institutions of research, culture and media ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;Attempts like this are crucial to emancipate the technology from the status a mere instrument for defined purposes, and to recognize the role that it should have as a creator of culture and practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isabelle Stengers]], [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/stengers.gif lettre de soutien, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Since the 1990s, many scientists in all disciplines, mentioned the Poietic Generator as a model which may help to rethink the cultural, even anthropological changing, latent in networks, and especially emphasized the urgency of a "redefinition of the notion of authorship".&lt;ref&gt;Anne Sauvageot et Michel Léglise, ''Culture visuelle et art collectif sur le web'' (PDF)], rapport au Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication, 1999 ([http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/rapports/sauvageot-leglise/art_col_web.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these researchers&lt;ref&gt;Some scientists supporting the Poietic Generator : [[Francisco Varela]] (biology) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/varela.gif lettre], [[Paul Virilio]] (urbanism and philosophy) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/virilio.gif lettre], [[Isabelle Stengers]] (history of science) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/stengers.gif lettre], [[Bernard Stiegler]] (philosophy) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/stiegler.gif lettre], [[:fr:Jean-Pierre Dupuy|Jean-Pierre Dupuy]] (philosophy) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/dupuy.gif lettre], [[w:en:Roy ascott|Roy Ascott]] (digital arts) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/ascott.gif lettre], [[Fred Forest]] (media art) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/forest.gif lettre], [[:fr:Jean-Pierre Le Goff (historian)|Jean-Pierre Le Goff]] (history of science)- [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/legoff.gif lettre], [[Pierre Lévy]] (cognitive sciences) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/levy.gif lettre], [http://cricc.univ-paris1.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=18 Isabelle Rieusset-Lemarié] (humanities) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/rieusset.gif lettre], [http://www.ehess.fr/fr/enseignement/enseignements/2012/enseignant/307/ Michel Tibon-Cornillot] (history of sciences), [http://liris.cnrs.fr/enaction/docs/fiches2008/CharlesLenay.html Charles Lenay] (history of sciences) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/lenay.gif lettre], [[:fr:René Passeron|René Passeron]] (esthetics) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/passeron.gif lettre], [http://chavalarias.com/tiki-index.php?page=Louis+Bec+%3A+L%27art+est+le+vivant&amp;bl=y Louis Bec] (artificial life) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/bec.gif lettre], [http://www.cnrs.fr/cw/dossiers/dosrob/accueil/laboratoires/labo/tuteur.html Philippe Coiffet] (robotics) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/coiffet.gif lettre], [http://www.twobirds.com/French/Lawyers/Pages/Pierre_Sirinelli1.aspx Pierre Sirinelli] (law) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/siri.gif lettre], [http://www.sgdl.org/toutes-les-actualites/718-notice-biographique-de-sandra-travers-de-faultrier Sandra Travers de Faultrier] (law) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/faultrier.gif lettre], [http://www.lactamme.polytechnique.fr/ Jean-François Colonna] (mathematics) - [http://poietic-generator.net/PICS/lettres/colonna.gif lettre]&lt;/ref&gt; brought in a personal support to attempts to practice large-scale experiments using channels such as broadcast television stations, museums, public places, etc. Without listening and support from these institutional broadcasters,&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Auber : 'Grandeur et déchéance programmée de l'art numérique en France'' 2011 ([http://perspective-numerique.net/wakka.php?wiki=GrandeurEtDecheanceProgrammee Web])&lt;/ref&gt; very few of these projects have been successful. Handicapped by its transdisciplinary or even "undisciplinary" nature, and naturally questioning the legitimacy of human organizations to which it is dealing with, the [[action research]] on the Poietic Generator has never found any other field to flourish as the Internet itself. Nevertheless, the Poietic Generator and writings of its author are quoted in many academic thesis,&lt;ref&gt;''Le copyleft appliqué à la création hors logiciel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6647">The term "'''Polish Border Strip'''" ({{lang-de|Polnischer Grenzstreifen}}; {{lang-pl|polski pas graniczny}}) or "'''Polish Frontier Strip'''" refers to those territories which the [[German Empire]] wanted to annex from [[Congress Poland]] after [[World War I]]. It appeared in plans proposed by German officials as a territory to be annexed by [[German Empire]] after an expected German and [[Central Powers]] victory. German planners also envisioned forced expulsion and resettlement of the [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Jewish people|Jewish]] population which would be replaced by [[Germans|German]] colonists.&lt;ref name="border strip"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goemans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legacies of Violence: Eastern Europe’s First World War  Jochen Böhler, Wlodzimierz Borodziej, Joachim von Puttkamer page 119  Germans in the East 1914-1918:Fantasies of Forced Movement&lt;/ref&gt;The proposed area of the Border Strip comprised up to 30,000 km² (approximately the size of Belgium), and up to 3 million people were to be ethnicly cleansed by the German Empire to make room for Germans.&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elusive Alliance: The German Occupation of Poland in World War I  Jesse Kauffman - 2015 ''The ethnic cleansing foreseen by the border strip's champions''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Empires in World War I: Shifting Frontiers and Imperial Dynamics in a Global ConflictRichard Fogarty, Andrew Jarboe
I.B.Tauris, 2014 ''this idea developed into one of annexing a Polish border strip, or frontier strip ... by ethnically cleansing the area of nationalist Poles and colonising the region with Germans from das Altreich''&lt;/ref&gt; The strip was also intended to separate the Polish inhabitants of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]]-held [[Greater Poland]] from those in Congress Poland.

==Details==
The idea of future "buffer zone" to be cleared of Poles and Jews as discussed officially at highest levels as early as 1914&lt;ref&gt;Germans, Poland, and Colonial Expansion to the East: 1850 Through the Present R. Nelson, page 80 "The Archive for Inner Colonization, the German East, and World War"
&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 1917 the [[Oberste Heeresleitung|German supreme command]] under [[Erich Ludendorff|General Ludendorff]], as part of the debate and planning regarding the cession of the "border strip" to Germany, specified its own designs in a memorandum.&lt;ref name="border strip"&gt;Keith Bullivant, Geoffrey J. Giles, Walter Pape, ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9042006889&amp;id=jXKk-gs-VNEC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=%22kingdom+of+Poland%22+1916&amp;sig=NjXAsXW-c7jn2mG-QckYol3iCoI Germany and Eastern Europe: Cultural Identity and Cultural Differences]'', Rodopi (1999), p. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed annexing a greatly enlarged "border strip" of 20,000 square kilometres, and ethnically cleansing its Polish and Jewish population (numbering between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000&lt;ref name="Geiss"&gt;Immanuel Geiss ''Tzw. polski pas graniczny 1914-1918''. Warszawa (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;) from a territory of 8,000 square kilometres and settling it with ethnic Germans.&lt;ref name="border strip"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goemans"&gt;Hein Erich Goemans, ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0691049440&amp;id=gsrFn2iR0eUC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;printsec=8&amp;dq=%22Kingdom+of+Poland%22+1916&amp;sig=z_Ubb4sE6O-WG07R0pRl7BmdL48 War and Punishment: The Causes of War Termination and the First World War]'', [[Princeton University Press]] (2000), p. 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carole Fink, ''Defending the Rights of Others: The Great Powers, the Jews, and International Minority Protection, 1878-1938'' Cambridge University Press (2006), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Poles living in Prussia, especially in the [[Province of Posen|province of Posen]], were to be "encouraged" by unspecified means to move into the German-ruled [[puppet state]] of [[Kingdom of Poland (1916–1918)|Kingdom of Poland]].&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;

The German minority living in Congress Poland, which had earlier suggested the annexation of all territory up to [[Łódź]] in a letter to the German government, also supported such proposals.&lt;ref&gt;
Aleksander Kraushar, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060928034304/http://www.biblioteka.warszawa1939.pl/books/book/okupacja/53.jpg Warszawa podczas okupacji niemieckiej 1915-1918]'', Lwów (1921), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The German government developed and agreed to these plans in March 1918, and in April gained support in the [[Prussian House of Lords]]; the plans for this were debated and developed across a wide spectrum of political parties and interested groups such as [[Political science|political scientists]], industrialists, and nationalist organisations like the [[Pan-German League]].&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;

[[Friedrich von Schwerin]], head of administration in Frankfurt/Oder and chairman of the Society for Inner Colonization stated "The German people, the greatest colonizing people on earth, have again been given a great colonizing task. The current world war provides the opportunity for Germany to resume in a resolute way its colonizing mission in the East''.
For admnistrators like Schwerin the plan was to be accompanied by massive expulsion of Poles as in his words""new land can usually only be won at the expense of those who own the land"&lt;ref&gt;Shatterzone of Empires: Coexistence and Violence in the German, Habsburg, Russian, and Ottoman Borderlands, Indiana University Press 2013, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;. The German nobility in certain versions of the plan were to become "colonial administration"&lt;ref&gt;Germany Turns Eastwards: A Study of Ostforschung in the Third Reich, 1991 Michael Burleigh, page 21
&lt;/ref&gt;
The plan has been described by historian Hajo Holborn as the first instance in modern European history of planning the removal of whole populations as a solution to national conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Hajo Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany: 1840-1945''. Princeton University Press (1982), p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; By removing the Polish population all resistance to Germanization of Polish territories would be bypassed&lt;ref&gt;hatterzone of Empires Coexistence and Violence in the German, Habsburg, Russian, and Ottoman Borderlands Edited by Omer Bartov and Eric D Weitz 2013 page 55&lt;/ref&gt; 

Parts of the plans were adopted by Nazi Germany after the war, and implemented in the genocidal [[Generalplan Ost]].&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;

The '''Program for Torture Victims''' (PTV) is a [[non-profit organization]] that provides medical, psychological, case management and legal services to [[torture]] survivors. PTV serves more than 300 victims of state-sponsored torture from over 65 countries annually.&lt;ref&gt;"The Organization." The Program for Torture Victims (PTV). Program for Torture Victims. Web. 13 July 2011. &lt;http://ptvla.org/organization.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Program for Torture Victims (PTV) was founded in 1980 by [[José Quiroga|Dr. José Quiroga]] and Ana Deutsch.&lt;ref&gt;L.A. Magazine, Feb 2013, pp 62-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Quiroga and Deutsch, both who sought asylum in the United States, met in [[Los Angeles]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meyerson|first=Harold|title=L.A., a refuge from the unspeakable|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/24/opinion/la-oe-meyerson-torture-20100624|accessdate=8-5-2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They began working on a campaign against torture with the Los Angeles Amnesty International Medical Group. The organization was conducting a study documenting cases of torture and the consequences for refugees and asylum-seekers in the United States. Quiroga assessed the medical consequences of torture while Deutsch assessed the victims' psychological well-being. However, [[Amnesty International]] decided that they, as an organization, were unable to provide direct treatment to torture survivors.&lt;ref name="IRTC"&gt;"Program for Torture Victims Celebrates 31st Anniversary." International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims. International Rehabilitation Clinic for Torture Victims. Web. 19 July 2011. &lt;http://www.irct.org/Default.aspx?ID=3843&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Quiroga and Deutsch knew that the torture survivors with whom they had been working needed rehabilitation services and decided to start the Program for Torture Victims.&lt;ref name="Mayor"&gt;Kruer, Rachel. "MAYOR AND COUNCILWOMAN ENDORSE “PROFIT FOR PEACE”." The Mayor of the City of Los Angeles. City of Los Angeles, 25 June 2010. Web. 19 July 2011. &lt;http://mayor.lacity.org/PressRoom/PressReleases/LACITYP_010646&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After the study by the Amnesty International Medical Group was completed, Quiroga presented it to the [[American Psychological Association]]. This was among the first research on the medical and psychological consequences of torture. Quiroga and Deutsch quickly became known as professionals treating victims of torture. It wasn’t until 1987, years after PTV began, that the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] was enforced and torture was legally recognized and defined for the first time&lt;ref name="IRTC" /&gt;

Quiroga and Deutsch began to treat clients in local clinics and in their own homes. Partnering with organizations such as Clinica Monseñor Oscar A. Romero, El Rescate, CARECEN and Amanecer, PTV quickly became well known in the Central American refugee community. Quiroga, having already been a volunteer at Venice Family Clinic for years, formed a partnership in which he was able to use their facilities to see PTV patients. Based in a small apartment at the time, Venice Family Clinic is now the largest community clinic in the U.S. and still home to PTV’s medical office.

In 1994, PTV received its first grant from the [[United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture]] and was incorporated as a 501 (c)3 non-profit organization. Several years later, in 2000, PTV received a federal grant for $2 million over a four-year period, allowing PTV to add staff and relocate the administrative office from Ms. Deutsch’s home to downtown Los Angeles. With paid staff and a central office, PTV was finally able to expand its scope to include areas like research and evaluation.

==Demographics==
According to a report by the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), 48,217 refugees were admitted into the U.S. in 2007.&lt;ref name="Refugees"&gt;Quiroga, J. and Jaranson, J. (2005). {{Sic|hide=y|Politically|-}}motivated torture and its survivors. A desk study review of the literature. [Thematic Issues] ''Torture, 2-3'', 1-111.&lt;/ref&gt; Of that total, 2,619 (5.43%) resettled in Florida,&lt;ref name="States"&gt;California Department of State Office of Admissions Refugee Processing Center (2009).

Retrieved October 5,2009 from http://www.wrapsnet.org/LinkClock.aspx?&lt;/ref&gt; 2,978 (6.18%) relocated to New York&lt;ref name="States" /&gt; and 6,699 (13.89%) chose to resettle in California;&lt;ref name="Refugees" /&gt; making California home to more incoming refugees than the next two states combined. Of all those who sought to make California their new home, 4,645 (69%) resettled in the five counties PTV serves&lt;ref name="States" /&gt; - Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura. Out of all of the counties in California, The Los Angeles Federal Immigration Court had greatest number of asylum seekers with 4,064. Between 2002 and 2008, the L.A. Federal Immigration Court adjudicated the highest number of asylum applications of any immigration court in California with 69,172 cases - 63% of the state total.&lt;ref name="Asylum"&gt;U.S. Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review Statistical Yearbook 2002-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As states, Florida and New York had 75,499 and 73,746 applications for asylum, respectively;&lt;ref name="Asylum" /&gt; just a fraction more than L.A. County alone.

===Client demographics===
The demographic makeup of PTV's client population is ever-changing, as global, regional, and national sociopolitical dynamics are constantly in flux. Thus far, PTV has served clients from over 65 countries.&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt;

==Services==
The Program for Torture Victims (PTV) has developed an integrated, comprehensive approach to rehabilitation. Clients see a PTV case manager, physician and psychotherapist. PTV partners with some of the region’s leading service providers, including the Venice Family Clinic, Clinica Oscar Romero, the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles and Public Counsel, among others.&lt;ref name="LAFLA"&gt;Ortiz, Michael, and Carolina Sheinfeld, eds.

Web. 18 July 2011. &lt;http://www.ptvla.org/services.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical evaluation and treatment===
Clients are evaluated by a PTV physician. When specialized procedures are needed, a wide network of physicians at the Venice Family Clinic and other local health care organizations are utilized at no cost to the client. PTV also offers ongoing consultation and trains health and mental health care providers on treating survivors of torture.&lt;ref name="LAFLA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Services - Medical."

PTV uses an integrated approach to rehabilitation that addresses the needs of torture survivors. This includes psychological evaluation, individual and family psychotherapy, psychiatric evaluation and follow-up, and psychological affidavits for asylum seekers in immigration court.&lt;ref name="LAFLA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Services - Psychological." The Program for Torture Victims (PTV). Program for Torture Victims. Web. 18 July 2011. &lt;http://www.ptvla.org/services-psychological.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Working with Families''' - PTV works with family members of torture survivors. The overall goal of intervention is to restore a healthy dynamic after the rupture created by persecution, uncertainty, and separation.
:'''Healing Club''' - The Healing Club is an informal gathering of clients, their family, and staff for cultural and recreational activities.  This activity creates a sense of community among and between torture survivors from different countries, religions, and ethnic backgrounds.
:'''Women’s Support Group''' - Nearly half of PTV’s clients are women.  The aim of the program is to empower them to recover their inner strengths and hope for the future.
:'''Asylum Readiness Group''' - This group provides clients with information about the asylum process, and addresses ways to reduce the stress that accompanies the process.  The goal is to give survivors confidence and optimism about their future.

===Legal support and training===
Most of PTV's clients seek refuge in the United States as asylum seekers. As the largest port of entry to torture survivors, Los Angeles has the highest number of asylum claims filed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review Statistical Yearbook 2002-2008&lt;/ref&gt;

PTV's staff prepares forensic medical and psychological evaluations and serve as expert witnesses in federal immigration court. Reliving horrific experiences through testimony can be extremely traumatic to the survivor.  The PTV clinical staff prepares the client for the emotional responses they might have on the stand.  The presence of a trusted PTV volunteer or staff member can provide the extra moral support a client needs to answer questions clearly and in the necessary detail about the experience.

PTV also works with an extensive network of attorneys to ensure legal assistance for clients.&lt;ref name="LAFLA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Services - Legal Support and Training." The Program for Torture Victims (PTV). Program for Torture Victims. Web. 18 July 2011. &lt;http://www.ptvla.org/services-legal.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social services and healing groups===
PTV provides emergency assistance with referrals for temporary shelter, food and other basic needs, as well as support in finding permanent housing and good jobs. They have also established support groups that create a sense of community for clients, address their various needs and help them become spokespeople against torture.&lt;ref&gt;"Services - Social Services and Healing Groups."

'''Prudence''' ({{lang-la|prudentia}}, [[Contraction (grammar)|contracted]] from {{lang|la|providentia}} meaning "seeing ahead, sagacity") is the ability to govern and discipline oneself by the use of [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prudence Prudence - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]. Merriam-webster.com (2012-08-31). Retrieved on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt; It is classically considered to be a [[virtue]], and in particular one of the four [[Cardinal virtues]] (which are, with the three [[theological virtues]], part of the [[seven virtues]]). '''Prudentia''' is an allegorical female personification of the virtue, whose attributes are a mirror and snake, who is frequently depicted as a pair with [[Justitia]], the Roman goddess of Justice.

The word derives from the 14th-century [[Old French]] word ''prudence'', which, in turn, derives from the Latin ''prudentia'' meaning "foresight, sagacity". It is often associated with [[wisdom]], [[insight]], and [[knowledge]].  In this case, the virtue is the ability to judge between virtuous and vicious actions, not only in a general sense, but with regard to appropriate actions at a given time and place. Although prudence itself does not perform any actions, and is concerned solely with knowledge, all virtues had to be regulated by it. Distinguishing when acts are [[courage]]ous, as opposed to [[Recklessness (psychology)|reckless]] or [[Cowardice|cowardly]], is an act of prudence, and for this reason it is classified as a cardinal (pivotal) virtue.

In modern [[English language|English]], the word has become increasingly [[synonym]]ous with cautiousness.  In this sense, prudence names a reluctance to take risks, which remains a virtue with respect to unnecessary risks, but, when unreasonably extended into over-cautiousness, can become the [[vice]] of cowardice.

In the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] gives a lengthy account of the virtue [[phronesis]] ({{lang-grc|ϕρόνησις}}), traditionally translated as "prudence", although this has become increasingly problematic as the word has fallen out of common usage.  More recently ϕρόνησις has been translated by such terms as "[[Phronesis|practical wisdom]]", "practical judgment" or "rational choice".

== As the "mother" of all virtues ==
[[File:DSCN2047.JPG|thumb|Allegory of Prudence on the [[tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany]] The female face depicts Francis' daughter [[Anne of Brittany]].]]

Prudence was considered by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and later on by [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosophers]], most notably [[Thomas Aquinas]], as the cause, measure and form of all virtues. It is considered to be the ''auriga virtutum'' or the charioteer of the virtues.

It is the cause in the sense that the virtues, which are defined to be the "perfected ability" of man as a spiritual person (spiritual personhood in the classical western understanding means having [[intelligence]] and [[free will]]), achieve their "perfection" only when they are founded upon prudence, that is to say upon the perfected ability to make right decisions. For instance, a person can live [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] when he has acquired the habit of deciding correctly the actions to take in response to his instinctual cravings.

Its function is to point out which course of action is to be taken in any concrete circumstances. It has nothing to do with directly willing the good it discerns. Prudence has a directive capacity with regard to the other virtues. It lights the way and measures the arena for their exercise. Without prudence, bravery becomes foolhardiness; mercy sinks into weakness, and temperance into fanaticism. Its office is to determine for each in practice those circumstances of time, place, manner, etc. which should be observed, and which the Scholastics comprise under the term "medium rationis". So it is that while it qualifies the intellect and not the will, it is nevertheless rightly styled a moral virtue.&lt;ref name="delany"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12517b.htm Delany, Joseph. "Prudence." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 2 May 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prudence is considered the measure of moral virtues since it provides a model of ethically good actions. "The work of art is true and real by its correspondence with the pattern of its prototype in the mind of the artist. In similar fashion, the free activity of man is good by its correspondence with the pattern of prudence." ([[Josef Pieper]]) For instance, a [[stockbroker]] using his experience and all the data available to him decides that it is beneficial to sell stock A at 2PM tomorrow and buy stock B today. The content of the decision (e.g., the stock, amount, time, and means) is the product of an act of prudence, while the actual carrying out of the decision may involve other virtues like fortitude (doing it in spite of fear of failure) and justice (doing his job well out of justice to his company and his family). The actual act's "goodness" is measured against that original decision made through prudence.&lt;ref&gt;Although Aristotle himself would have considered this way of making money contemptible: "[T]hose who ply sordid trades...and those who lend small sums and at high rates...take more than they ought and from wrong sources. What is common to them is evidently sordid love of gain...[A]ll such forms of taking are mean." (''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' 1121b31)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greek and Scholastic philosophy, "form" is the specific characteristic of a thing that makes it what it is. With this language, prudence confers upon other virtues the form of its inner essence; that is, its specific character as a virtue. For instance, not all acts of telling the truth are considered good, considered as done with the virtue of honesty. What makes telling the truth a virtue is whether it is done with prudence.

== Versus imprudence, cunning and false prudence ==

In Christian understanding, the difference between prudence and cunning lies in the intent with which the decision of the context of an action is made. The Christian understanding of the world includes the existence of [[God]], the [[natural law]] and [[Morality|moral]] implications of human actions. In this context, prudence is different from cunning in that it takes into account the supernatural good. For instance, the decision of persecuted Christians to be [[martyr]]ed rather than deny their faith is considered prudent. 

According to [[Thomas Aquinas]], judgments using reasons for evil ends or using evil means are considered to be made through "cunning" and "false prudence" and not through prudence.&lt;ref name="delany"/&gt; However "imprudence" was not be considered a sin since it was not voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;St Thomas Aquinas Summa Theologica, Volume 3 (Part II, Second Section) 1602065578 2013 - p 1409 "It would seem that imprudence is not a sin. For every sin is voluntary, according to Augustine;* whereas imprudence is not voluntary, since no man wishes to be imprudent. Therefore imprudence is not a sin"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Greek term for prudence is synonymous with “forethought". People, the Ancient Greeks believed, must have enough prudence to prepare for worshiping the Olympian gods.  Exceptional were the foolish Bacchic cult, who lived an emotional and passionate lifestyle. Believing the antisexual Olympian traditions to be shameful, professors of the Bacchic cult celebrated the irrationality that governed their religion.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. History of Western Philosophy.Routledge, 1996, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integral parts ==
[[File:Justice and Prudence window, Lindfield.jpg|thumb|[[Justice]] and Prudence window, Lindfield. Third window, south chapel, All Saints Church, Lindfield, West Sussex. Made in or after 1906 by Christopher Whall.]]
Prudence is the application of universal principles to particular situations.&lt;ref name="mcmanaman"&gt;[https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/education/catholic-contributions/the-virtue-of-prudence.html McManaman, Douglas. "The Virtue of Prudence", Catholic Education Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt; "Integral parts" of virtues, in [[Scholasticism|Scholastic philosophy]], are the elements that must be present for any complete or perfect act of the virtue. The following are the integral parts of prudence:
* ''[[Memoria]]'' : accurate memory; that is, memory that is true to reality; an ability to learn from experience;&lt;ref name="mcmanaman"/&gt;
* ''Docilitas'' : an open-mindedness that recognizes variety and is able to seek and make use of the experience and authority of others;&lt;ref name="mcmanaman"/&gt;
* ''Intelligentia'' : the understanding of [[first principle]]s;
* ''Sollertia'' : shrewdness or quick-wittedness, i.e. the ability to evaluate a situation quickly;
* ''[[Ratio]]'' : Discursive reasoning and the ability to research and compare alternatives;
* ''[[Providentia]]'' : foresight&amp;nbsp;– i.e. the capacity to estimate whether particular actions can realize goals;
* ''Circumspection'' : the ability to take all relevant circumstances into account;
* ''[[:wikt:caution|Caution]]'' : the ability to mitigate risk.

== Prudential judgment ==
{{refimprove section|small=y|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Titian - Allegorie der Zeit.jpg|thumb|''[[Allegory of Prudence]]'' by [[Titian]]. To Titian, prudence was preparation, foresight and judgement from experience and human history. The three faces in the painting represent the passing of human generations, with the young facing the light while the oldest fade into shadow; the faint inscription above their heads may be translated as "From the past, the present acts prudently, lest it spoils future action".&lt;ref&gt;David Summers (1987), ''The Judgment of Sense: Renaissance Naturalism and the Rise of Aesthetics'', Cambridge University Press ({{ISBN|978-0-521-32675-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In ethics, a "prudential judgment" is one where the circumstances must be weighed to determine the correct action.  Generally, it applies to situations where two people could weigh the circumstances differently and ''ethically'' come to different conclusions.

For instance, in the theory of [[just war]], the government of a nation must weigh whether the harms they suffer are more than the harms that would be produced by their going to war against another nation that is harming them; the decision whether to go to war is therefore a prudential judgment.

In another case, a patient who has a terminal illness with no conventional treatment may hear of an experimental treatment.  To decide whether to take it would require weighing on one hand, the cost, time, possible lack of benefit, and possible pain, disability, and hastened death, and on the other hand, the possible benefit and the benefit to others of what could be learned from his case.

== In rhetoric ==
[[File:Main_ornate_of_the_facade,_Castellania_Malta.jpeg|thumb|left|Main gate of 18th-century [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]] portraying [[Lady Justice]] and [[Prudentia|Lady Prudentia]] above]]
[[Phronesis]], or practical wisdom, holds an important place in [[Rhetoric|rhetorical theory]] as a central aspect of judgment and practice. [[Aristotle]]'s notion of phronesis fits with his notes on rhetoric because neither, in his estimation, could be reduced to an ''[[episteme]]'' or a ''[[techne]]'', and both deal with the ability to deliberate about contingent, variable, or indeterminate matters.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[Cicero]] defined ''prudentia'' as a rhetorical norm in ''[[De Oratore]]'', ''[[De officiis]]'', ''[[De Inventione]]'', and ''[[De re publica]]''. He contrasts the term with ''imprudens'', young men failing to consider the consequences before they act. The ''prudens'', or those who had prudence, knew when to speak and when to stay silent. Cicero maintained that prudence was gained only through experience, and while it was applied in everyday conversation, in public discourse it was subordinated to the broader term for wisdom, ''sapientia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hariman |first=Robert |title=Prudence: classical virtue, postmodern practice |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press |year=2003 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the contemporary era, rhetorical scholars have tried to recover a robust meaning for the term. They have maintained consistency with the ancient orators, contending that prudence is an embodied persuasive resource.&lt;ref name="Jasinski"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jasinski |first=James |year=2001 |title=Sourcebook on Rhetoric |publisher=Sage Publications |page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although sets of principles or rules can be constructed in a particular culture, scholars agree that prudence cannot be derived from a set of timeless principles. Instead, through gauging the situation and through reasoned deliberation, a speaker should determine the set of values and morals by which to base his or her actions. Furthermore, scholars suggest the capacity to take into account the particularities of the situation as vital to prudential practice. For example, as rhetorical scholar Lois Self explains, "both rhetoric and phronesis are normative processes in that they involve rational principles of choice-making; both have general applicability but always require careful analysis of particulars in determining the best response to each specific situation; both ideally take into account the wholeness of human nature; and finally, both have social utility and responsibility in that both treat matter of the public good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lois |last=Self |chapter=Rhetoric and Phronesis: The Aristotelian Ideal |title=Philosophy and Rhetoric |publisher=Penn State University Press |year=1979 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Hariman]], in his examination of [[Malcolm X]], adds that "aesthetic sensibility, imitation of a performative ideal, and improvisation upon conventions of presentation" are also components of practical reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hariman |first=Robert |title=Theory without Modernity |year=1991 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small differences emerge between rhetorical scholars regarding definitions of the term and methods of analysis. [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] asserted that prudence materializes through the application of principles and can be evaluated accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gadamer|first=Hans-George |title=Truth and Method |journal=Crossroad |year=1982 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his analysis of [[Andrew Cuomo]]'s speech to the Catholic Church of Notre Dame, James Jasinski contends that prudence cannot {{clarify span|be calculated by formal matters like consequences|date=February 2015}} as it is not a ''episteme'' or ''techne''; instead, it is judged according to embodied rhetorical performance.&lt;ref name="Jasinski"/&gt; Thus, while Gadamer would judge prudence based on the execution of contingent principles, Jasinski would examine the artistry of communication in its cultural milieu between accommodation ([[compromise]]) and audacity ([[courage]]).{{clarify|date=February 2015}}

In his study of [[Machiavelli]], examining the relationship between prudence and moderation, rhetorician Eugene Garver holds that there is a middle ground between "an ethics of principles, in which those principles univocally dictate action" and "an ethics of consequences, in which the successful result is all".&lt;ref name="Garver"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garver |first=Eugene |title=Machiavelli and the History of Prudence |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=1987 |isbn=0-299-11080-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; His premise stems from Aristotle's theory of virtue as an "intermediate", in which moderation and compromise embody prudence. Yet, because valorizing moderation is not an active response, prudence entails the "transformation of moderation" into a fitting response, making it a flexible situational norm. Garver also asserts that prudential reasoning differs from "algorithmic" and "[[heuristic]]" reasoning because it is rooted in a political community, the context in which common problems regarding stability and innovation arise and call for prudential reasoning.&lt;ref name="Garver"/&gt;

== In economics ==
&lt;!--[[Saving]] links here --&gt;

Economists describe a [[consumer]] as "prudent" if he or she [[Saving|saves]] more when faced with [[risk]]ier future income. This additional saving is called [[precautionary saving]]. 

If a risk-averse consumer has a [[utility function]] &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; over consumption ''x'', and if &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Derivative|differentiable]], then the consumer is not prudent unless the third [[derivative]] of utility is positive, that is, &lt;math&gt;
u^{'''}\left(x\right)&gt;0
&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Sandmo |year=1970 |title=The Effect of Uncertainty on Saving Decisions |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=353–360 |jstor=2296725 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strength of the precautionary saving motive can be measured by '''absolute prudence''', which is defined as
&lt;math&gt;
-\frac{u^{'''}\left(x\right)}{u^{''}\left(x\right)}
&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, '''relative prudence''' is defined as absolute prudence, multiplied by the level of consumption. These measures are closely related to the concepts of absolute and relative [[risk aversion]] developed by [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[John W. Pratt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Kimball |year=1990 |title=Precautionary Saving in the Small and in the Large |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=53–73 |jstor=2938334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In accounting ==

In [[accounting]], prudence was long considered one of the "fundamental accounting concepts" in its determination of the time for [[revenue recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim31030.htm Tax and accountancy: 'fundamental accounting concepts'], [[HMRC]], UK. Retrieved 2011-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of prudence meant that gains should not be anticipated unless their realisation was highly probable. However, recent developments in [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] have led academic critics to accuse the international standard-setting body [[IASB]] of abandoning prudence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1808094/iasb-abandoned-prudence-professor-warns IASB has abandoned prudence, professor warns], ''[[Accountancy Age]]'', 24 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK)|British reporting standard]] FRS 18, prudence, along with consistency, was relegated to a "desirable" quality of financial information rather than fundamental concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim31032.htm Tax and accountancy: development of accountancy concepts and new objectives: FRS18], HMRC. Retrieved 2011-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Prudence was rejected for IFRS because it was seen as compromising accounts' neutrality.&lt;ref name="Lords"&gt;Rose Orlik, [http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/analysis/2039988/lords-leap-international-standards Lords took a leap on international standards], ''[[Accountancy Age]]'',  4 Apr 2011. Retrieved 2011-04-12..&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 report on the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], the British [[House of Lords]] bemoaned the demotion of prudence as a governing principle of accounting and [[Financial audit|audit]]. Their comments, however, were disputed by some leading practitioners.&lt;ref name="Lords"/&gt;

The '''right of self-defense''' (also called, when it applies to the defense of another, '''alter ego defense''', '''defense of others''', '''defense of a third person''') is the right for people to use reasonable force or defensive force, for the purpose of defending one's own life ([[self-defense]]) or the lives of others, including –in certain circumstances– the use of [[deadly force]].&lt;ref&gt;For the rationale of Self-defense, see: Boaz Sangero, Self-Defence in Criminal Law 11 - 106 (Hart Publishing, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

If a defendant uses defensive force because of a threat of deadly or grievous harm by the other person, or a reasonable perception of such harm, the defendant is said to have a "perfect self-defense" [[Justification (jurisprudence)|justification]].&lt;ref name=CL&gt;Criminal Law Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder&lt;/ref&gt; If defendant uses defensive force because of such a perception, and the perception is not reasonable, the defendant may have an "[[imperfect self-defense]]" as an [[excuse]].&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;

== Theory ==
{{see also|Self-defence in international law}}
{{quote|Justification does not make a criminal use of force lawful;  if the use of force is justified, it cannot be criminal at all.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams Textbook of Criminal Law (London: 2012) at Chapter 21.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The early theories make no distinction between [[civil defense|defense]] of the person and defense of property. Whether consciously or not, this builds on the [[Roman law|Roman Law]] principle of ''dominium'' where any attack on the members of the family or the property it owned was a personal attack on the ''[[pater familias]]''{{spaced ndash}} the male head of the household, sole owner of all property belonging to the household, and endowed by law with dominion over all his descendants through the male line no matter their age.&lt;ref&gt;''See generally'', Frier &amp; McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', Oxford University Press (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The right to self-defense is phrased as the principle of ''vim vi repellere licet'' ("it is permitted to repel force by force") in the [[Digest (Roman law)|''Digest'' of Justitian]] (6th century).

In ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651), [[Hobbes]] (using the English term ''self-defense'' for the first time) proposed the foundation political theory that distinguishes between a [[state of nature]] where there is no authority and a modern state. Hobbes argues that although some may be stronger or more intelligent than others in their natural state, none are so strong as to be beyond a fear of violent death, which justifies self-defense as the highest necessity. In the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', [[John Locke]] asserts the reason why an owner would give up their autonomy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure. This makes him willing to quit a condition, which, however free, is full of fears and continual dangers: and it is not without reason, that he seeks out, and is willing to join in society with others, who are already united, or have a mind to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties and estates, which I call by the general name, property.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In earlier times before the development of national policing, an attack on the family home was effectively either an assault on the people actually inside or an indirect assault on their welfare by depriving them of shelter and/or the means of production. This linkage between a personal attack and property weakened as societies developed but the threat of violence remains a key factor. As an aspect of [[sovereignty]], in his 1918 speech ''Politik als Beruf'' ([[Politics as a Vocation]]), [[Max Weber]] defined a [[State (polity)|state]] as an authority claiming the [[monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force]] within defined territorial boundaries. Recognizing that the modern framework of [[nation]]s has emerged from the use of force, Weber asserted that the exercise of power through the institutions of [[government]] remained indispensable for effective government at any level which necessarily implies that self-help is limited if not excluded.

For modern theorists, the question of self-defense is one of [[morality|moral]] authority within the nation to set the limits to obedience to the state and its laws given the pervasive dangers in a world full of weapons. In modern societies, states are increasingly delegating or privatizing their coercive powers to corporate providers of security services either to supplement or replace components within the power hierarchy. The fact that states no longer claim a monopoly to police within their borders, enhances the argument that individuals may exercise a right or privilege to use violence in their own defense. Indeed, modern [[libertarianism]] characterizes the majority of laws as intrusive to personal autonomy and, in particular, argues that the right of self-defense from [[coercion]] (including [[violence]]) is a fundamental [[human right]], and in all cases, with no exceptions, justifies all uses of [[violence]] stemming from this right, regardless whether in defense of the person or property. In this context, note that Article 12 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The inclusion of defense of one's family and home recognizes the universal benefit claimed to stem from the family's peaceable possession of private property. This general approach implicitly attacks [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld|Hohfeld's]] focus on the [[corelative|correlative]] relationship between right and duty as an aspect of human interactiveness as opposed to rights deemed implicitly more important because they attach to a person by virtue of his or her ownership of property. Further, it follows that, in this moral balancing exercise, laws must simultaneously criminalize aggression resulting in loss or injury, but decriminalize qualitatively identical violence causing loss or injury because it is used in self-defense. As a resolution of this apparent paradox and in defiance of Hohfeld, [[Robert Nozick]] asserted that there are no positive [[civil rights]], only rights to property and the right of autonomy. In this theory, the "acquisition principle" states that people are entitled to defend and retain all holdings acquired in a just way and the "rectification principle" requires that any violation of the first principle be repaired by returning holdings to their rightful owners as a "one time" redistribution. Hence, in default of self-defense in the first instance, any damage to property must be made good either in kind or by value. Similarly, theorists such as George Fletcher and Robert Schopp have adopted European concepts of autonomy in their liberal theories to justify the right-holder using all necessary force to defend his or her autonomy and rights. This right inverts the ''felicitation principle'' of [[utilitarianism]] with the responsive violence being the greatest good to the individual, but accurately mirrors [[Jeremy Bentham]] who saw property as the driving force to enable individuals to enhance their utilities through stable investment and trade. In liberal theory, therefore, to maximise the utility, there is no need to retreat nor use only proportionate force. The attacker is said to sacrifice legal protection when initiating the attack. In this respect, the criminal law is not the tool of a [[welfare state]] which offers a safety net for all when they are injured. Nevertheless, some limits must be recognized as where a minor initial attack simply becomes a pretext for an excessively violent response. The [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems have a theory of "abuse of right" to explain denial of justification in such extreme cases.

== Defense of others ==
{{Tort law|defenses}}

The rules are the same when force is used to protect ''another'' from danger.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt; Generally, the defendant must have a reasonable belief that the third party is in a position where they have the right of self-defense. For example, a person who unknowingly chances upon two actors practicing a fight would be able to defend their restraint of the one that appeared to be the aggressor. However, in many jurisdictions a person who causes injury in defense of another may be liable to criminal and civil charges if such defence turned out to be unnecessary.

Defense of others is called ''[[pikuach nefesh]]'' in [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. One must violate most negative commandments of the [[Torah]] in order to save someone's life.

== Legal Defense for Self-Defense Claim ==
When trying to claim a self-defense case it will all depend on the threat. Was it a verbal threat to where the person felt threatened. To where he or she felt like they needed to defend themselves. It will also depend on if the threat was imminent or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/i/imminent-danger/|title=Imminent Danger Law and Legal Definition {{!}} USLegal, Inc.|last=Inc.|first=US Legal,|website=definitions.uslegal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Was the threat about to happen, was the person's life really in danger. Did he or she provoke the person for the attack to happen. When the person attacked the person, did his or hers self-defense match the threat. Was it an overkill to where the person ended up dead. To where you didn't need to put that much force towards a person. Was it a 'castle doctrine' defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/castle_doctrine|title=Castle Doctrine|last=Ryan|first=Ms. Meghan|date=2009-11-16|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Did they intentionally break in your home and try to harm you or your family to where he or she had to defend themselves or others using deadly force. To claim self-defense one of these things must have happened. 

==Model Penal Code==
[[Model Penal Code]] §3.04 contains an elaborate formulation for use of force, including when it is justified, and limitations on the justification.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;

==Common law cases==
In ''[[People v. La Voie]]'', Supreme Court of Colorado, 395 P.2d 1001 (1964), The court wrote, ''"When a person has reasonable grounds for believing, and does in fact actually believe, that danger of his being killed, or of receiving great bodily harm, is imminent, he may act on such appearances and defend himself, even to the extent of taking human life when necessary, although it may turn out that the appearances were false, or although he may have been mistaken as to the extent of the real actual danger."''

{{Rights}}

'''Rights''' are [[law|legal]], social, or [[ethics|ethical]] [[principle]]s of [[Liberty|freedom]] or [[entitlement]]; that is, rights are the fundamental [[normative]] rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt; Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as [[law]] and [[ethics]], especially theories of [[justice]] and [[deontology]].
 
Rights are often considered fundamental to [[civilization]], for they are regarded as established pillars of [[society]] and [[culture]],&lt;ref&gt;UN [[UDHR]] Preamble: "Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world..."&lt;/ref&gt; and the history of [[social conflict]]s can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "rights structure the form of [[government]]s, the content of [[laws]], and the shape of [[morality]] as it is currently perceived".&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt;

==Definitional issues==
[[File:RNC 04 protest 89.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Street protest scene; people deliberately lying down on a busy city street, surrounded by onlookers and police|Rights are widely regarded as the basis of law, but what if laws are bad? Some theorists suggest [[civil disobedience]] is, itself, a ''right'', and it was advocated by thinkers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]].]]
There is considerable disagreement about what is meant precisely by the term ''rights''. It has been used by different groups and thinkers for different purposes, with different and sometimes opposing definitions, and the precise definition of this principle, beyond having something to do with normative rules of some sort or another, is controversial.

One way to get an idea of the multiple understandings and senses of the term is to consider different ways it is used. Many diverse things are claimed as rights: {{cquote|A right to life, a right to choose; a right to vote, to work, to strike; a right to one phone call, to dissolve parliament, to operate a forklift, to asylum, to equal treatment before the law, to feel proud of what one has done; a right to exist, to sentence an offender to death, to launch a nuclear first strike, to carry a concealed weapon, to a distinct genetic identity; a right to believe one's own eyes, to pronounce the couple husband and wife, to be left alone, to go to hell in one's own way.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg&gt;{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = Rights dominate most modern understandings of what actions are proper and which institutions are just. Rights structure the forms of our governments, the contents of our laws, and the shape of morality as we perceive it. To accept a set of rights is to approve a distribution of freedom and authority, and so to endorse a certain view of what may, must, and must not be done.
|publisher = ''Stanford University''
|date = July 9, 2007
|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/
|accessdate = 2009-12-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are likewise diverse possible ways to categorize rights, such as:
{{cquote|''Who'' is alleged to have the right: Children's rights, animal rights, workers' rights, states' rights, the rights of peoples. ''What actions or states or objects'' the asserted right pertains to: Rights of free expression, to pass judgment; rights of privacy, to remain silent; property rights, bodily rights. ''Why'' the rightholder (allegedly) has the right: Moral rights spring from moral reasons, legal rights derive from the laws of the society, customary rights are aspects of local customs. ''How the asserted right can be affected'' by the rightholder's actions: The inalienable right to life, the forfeitable right to liberty, and the waivable right that a promise be kept.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt;}}
There has been considerable debate about what this term means within the academic community, particularly within fields such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[deontology]], [[logic]], [[political science]], and [[religion]].

===Natural versus legal===
[[File:Brueghel Jan II God creating.jpg|thumb|right|alt=painting of dark gray skies with trees and water, and a human image, flying, with arms outstretched|According to some views, certain rights derive from [[deities]] or [[nature]]]]
{{Main|Natural and legal rights}}
* '''Natural rights''' are rights which are "natural" in the sense of "not artificial, not man-made", as in rights deriving from [[human nature]] or from the [[divine command theory|edicts of a god]]. They are universal; that is, they apply to all people, and do not derive from the laws of any specific society. They exist necessarily, inhere in every individual, and can't be taken away. For example, it has been argued that humans have a natural ''right to life''. These are sometimes called ''[[natural and legal rights|moral rights]]'' or ''inalienable rights''.
* '''Legal rights''', in contrast, are based on a society's customs, laws, [[statute]]s or actions by [[legislature]]s. An example of a legal right is the ''right to vote'' of citizens. [[Citizenship]], itself, is often considered as the basis for having legal rights, and has been defined as the "right to have rights". Legal rights are sometimes called ''[[civil rights]]'' or ''statutory rights'' and are culturally and politically [[moral relativism|relative]] since they depend on a specific societal context to have meaning.

Some thinkers see rights in only one sense while others accept that both senses have a measure of validity. There has been considerable philosophical debate about these senses throughout history. For example, [[Jeremy Bentham]] believed that legal rights were the essence of rights, and he denied the existence of natural rights; whereas [[Thomas Aquinas]] held that rights purported by [[positive law]] but not grounded in [[natural law]] were not properly rights at all, but only a facade or pretense of rights.

===Claim versus liberty===
[[File:Chorin deed 1273.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a deed which has hand-written writing on a yellowed piece of paper with three gold tassles at the bottom|A [[deed]] is an example of a ''claim right'' in the sense that it asserts a ''right'' to own land. This particular deed dates back to 1273.]]
{{Main|Claim rights and liberty rights}}
* A '''claim right''' is a right which entails that another person has a duty to the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain from doing something to or for the ''claim holder'', such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a ''claim'' to that service or product (another term is ''[[thing in action]]'').&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;Fagan, Andrew. "Human Rights". ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH3b&lt;/ref&gt; In logic, this idea can be expressed as: "Person ''A'' has a claim that person ''B'' do something if and only if ''B'' has a duty to ''A'' to do that something." Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like "life, liberty, and property"; these rights impose an obligation upon others ''not'' to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be provided with those services.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* A '''liberty right''' or ''privilege'', in contrast, is simply a freedom or permission for the right-holder to do something, and there are ''no obligations'' on other parties to do or not do anything.&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt; This can be expressed in logic as: "Person ''A'' has a privilege to do something if and only if ''A'' has no duty not to do that something." For example, if a person has a legal liberty right to free speech, that merely means that it is not legally forbidden for them to speak freely: it does ''not'' mean that anyone has to help enable their speech, or to listen to their speech; or even, per se, refrain from stopping them from speaking, though ''other'' rights, such as the claim right to be free from assault, may severely limit what others can do to stop them.

Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so. Likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, then that other person's liberty is limited. For example, a person has a ''liberty right'' to walk down a sidewalk and can decide freely whether or not to do so, since there is no obligation either to do so or to refrain from doing so. But pedestrians may have an obligation not to walk on certain lands, such as other people's private property, to which those other people have a claim right. So a person's ''liberty right'' of walking extends precisely to the point where another's ''claim right'' limits his or her freedom.

===Positive versus negative===
{{Main|Negative and positive rights}}
In one sense, a right is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific service or treatment from others, and these rights have been called ''positive rights''. However, in another sense, rights may allow or require inaction, and these are called ''negative rights''; they permit or require doing nothing. For example, in some countries, e.g. the [[United States]], citizens have the ''positive right'' to vote and they have the ''negative right'' to not vote; people can choose not to vote in a given election without punishment. In other countries, e.g. [[Australia]], however, citizens have a positive right to vote but they don't have a negative right to not vote, since [[compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]]. Accordingly:
* '''Positive rights''' are permissions to do things, or entitlements to be done unto. One example of a positive right is the purported "right to welfare."&lt;ref name=tws21decgkfjf/&gt;
* '''Negative rights''' are permissions not to do things, or entitlements to be left alone. Often the distinction is invoked by [[libertarianism|libertarians]] who think of a ''negative right'' as an entitlement to non-interference such as a right against being assaulted.&lt;ref name=tws21decgkfjf&gt;{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = A distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among some normative theorists, especially those with a bent toward libertarianism. The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right.
|publisher = ''Stanford University''
|date = July 9, 2007
|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/
|accessdate = 2009-12-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though similarly named, positive and negative rights should not be confused with ''active rights'' (which encompass "privileges" and "powers") and ''passive rights'' (which encompass "claims" and "immunities").

===Individual versus group===
{{Main|Individual and group rights}}
The general concept of rights is that they are possessed by individuals in the sense that they are permissions and entitlements to do things which other persons, or which governments or authorities, can not infringe. This is the understanding of people such as the author [[Ayn Rand]] who argued that only individuals have rights, according to her philosophy known as [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].&lt;ref name=tws18decafafa&gt;{{cite news
|author = Ayn Rand
|title = The Virtue of Selfishness: Individual Rights
|quote = Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual). see page 104. See also: [[Group rights#Objectivist view|Collectivized 'Rights]]
|publisher = ''The Ayn Rand Lexicon''
|date = 2009-12-18
|url = http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html
|accessdate = 2009-12-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have argued that there are situations in which a group of persons is thought to have rights, or ''group rights''. Accordingly:
* '''Individual rights''' are rights held by individual people regardless of their group membership or lack thereof.
[[File:Malian Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Soldiers lined up in a row, with green caps, carrying rifles|Do groups have ''rights''? Some argue that when soldiers bond in [[combat]], the group becomes like an organism in itself and has ''rights'' which trump the rights of any individual soldier.]]
* '''Group rights''' have been argued to exist when a group is seen as more than a mere composite or assembly of separate individuals but an entity in its own right. In other words, it's possible to see a group as a distinct being in and of itself; it's akin to an enlarged individual, a corporate body, which has a distinct will and power of action and can be thought of as having ''rights''. For example, a platoon of soldiers in [[combat]] can be thought of as a distinct group, since individual members are willing to risk their lives for the survival of the group, and therefore the group can be conceived as having a "right" which is superior to that of any individual member; for example, a soldier who disobeys an officer can be punished, perhaps even killed, for a breach of obedience.  But there is another sense of group rights in which people who are members of a group can be thought of as having specific individual rights because of their membership in a group. In this sense, the set of rights which individuals-as-group-members have is expanded because of their membership in a group. For example, workers who are members of a group such as a [[Trade union|labor union]] can be thought of as having expanded individual rights because of their membership in the labor union, such as the rights to specific working conditions or wages. As expected, there is sometimes considerable disagreement about what exactly is meant by the term "group" as well as by the term "group rights."{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

There can be tension between individual and group rights. A classic instance in which group and individual rights clash is conflicts between unions and their members. For example, individual members of a union may wish a wage higher than the union-negotiated wage, but are prevented from making further requests; in a so-called [[closed shop]] which has a [[union security agreement]], only the union has a ''right'' to decide matters for the individual union members such as wage rates. So, do the supposed "individual rights" of the workers prevail about the proper wage? Or do the "group rights" of the union regarding the proper wage prevail? Clearly this is a source of tension.

The [[Austrian School|Austrian School of Economics]] holds that only individuals think, feel, and act whether or not members of any abstract group. The society should thus according to economists of the school be analyzed starting from the individual. This methodology is called [[methodological individualism]] and is used by the economists to justify [[individual rights]].

===Other senses===
Other distinctions between rights draw more on historical association or [[family resemblance]] than on precise philosophical distinctions. These include the distinction between '''[[civil and political rights]]''' and '''[[economic, social and cultural rights]]''', between which the articles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] are often divided. Another conception of rights groups them into '''[[three generations of human rights|three generations]]'''. These distinctions have much overlap with that between [[negative and positive rights]], as well as between [[individual rights]] and [[group rights]], but these groupings are not entirely coextensive.

Rights are often included in the foundational questions that governments and politics have been designed to deal with. Often the development of these socio-political institutions have formed a dialectical relationship with rights.

Rights about particular issues, or the rights of particular groups, are often areas of special concern. Often these concerns arise when rights come into conflict with other legal or moral issues, sometimes even other rights.  Issues of concern have historically included [[labor rights]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights]], [[reproductive rights]], [[disability rights]], [[patient rights]] and [[prisoners' rights]].  With increasing [[mass surveillance|monitoring]] and the information society, [[digital rights|information rights]], such as the [[right to privacy]] are becoming more important.

Some examples of groups whose rights are of particular concern include [[animal rights|animals]],&lt;ref name=tws21decghnnb&gt;{{cite news

Accordingly, politics plays an important role in developing or recognizing the above rights, and the discussion about which behaviors are included as "rights" is an ongoing political topic of importance. The concept of rights varies with political orientation. Positive rights such as a "right to medical care" are emphasized more often by left-leaning thinkers, while right-leaning thinkers place more emphasis on negative rights such as the "right to a fair trial".

Further, the term ''equality'' which is often bound up with the meaning of "rights" often depends on one's political orientation. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and advocates of [[free markets]] often identify equality with [[equality of opportunity]], and want equal and fair rules in the process of making things, while agreeing that sometimes these fair rules lead to unequal outcomes. In contrast, [[socialism|socialists]] often identify equality with [[equality of outcome]] and see fairness when people have equal amounts of goods and services, and therefore think that people have a right to equal portions of necessities such as [[health care]] or [[Welfare|economic assistance]] or [[House|housing]].&lt;ref name=tws21dece563e&gt;{{cite news

|quote = Equality of opportunity is to be contrasted with equality of outcome. While advocacy of the latter has been traditionally associated with a left-wing political philosophy, the former has been championed by conservative political philosophy. Equality of outcome fails to hold individuals responsible for imprudent actions that may, absent redress, reduce the values of the outcomes they enjoy, or for wise actions that would raise the value of the outcomes above the levels of others’. Equality of opportunity, in contrast, ‘levels the playing field,’ so that all have the potential to achieve the same outcomes; whether or not, in the event, they do, depends upon individual choice.

==Philosophy==
In [[philosophy]], [[meta-ethics]] is the branch of ethics that seeks to understand the nature of ethical [[property (philosophy)|properties]], statements, attitudes, and judgments. Meta-ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally recognized by philosophers, the others being [[normative ethics]] and [[applied ethics]].

While normative ethics addresses such questions as "What should one do?", thus endorsing some ethical evaluations and rejecting others, meta-ethics addresses questions such as "What ''is'' goodness?" and "How can we tell what is good from what is bad?", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations.

Rights ethics is an answer to the meta-ethical question of ''what normative ethics is concerned with'' (Meta-ethics also includes a group of questions about how ethics comes to be known, true, etc. which is not directly addressed by rights ethics).
Rights ethics holds that normative ethics is concerned with rights. Alternative meta-ethical theories are that ethics is concerned with one of the following:
* Duties ([[deontology]])
* [[Value (ethics)|Value]] ([[axiology]])
* Virtue ([[virtue ethics]])
* Consequences ([[consequentialism]], e.g. [[utilitarianism]])

Rights ethics has had considerable influence on political and social thinking. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] gives some concrete examples of widely accepted rights.

===Criticism===
Some philosophers have criticised rights as [[ontologically]] dubious entities.  For instance, although in favour of the extension of [[individual rights|individual legal rights]], the [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] opposed the idea of [[natural law]] and [[natural rights]], calling them "nonsense upon stilts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Ross |chapterurl=http://www.utilitarian.net/bentham/about/1995----.htm |chapter=Jeremy Bentham |editor-last=Honderich |editor-first=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |pages=85–88 }} Also see {{cite web |last=Sweet |first=William |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/b/bentham.htm |title=Jeremy Bentham |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=7 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, one can question the ability of rights to actually bring about justice for all.

==Etymology==
[[File:Beowulf - rihte.jpg|thumb|"rihte," an Old English word for 'right']]
The [[Modern English]] word ''right'' derives from [[Old English]] ''riht'' or ''reht'', in turn from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*riχtaz'' meaning "right" or "direct", and ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*reg-to-'' meaning "having moved in a straight line", in turn from ''*(o)reg'(a)-'' meaning "to straighten or direct".&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:right]]&lt;/ref&gt; In several different [[Indo-European languages]], a single word derived from the same root means both "right" and "law", such as French ''droit'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:droit]]&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish ''derecho'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:derecho]]&lt;/ref&gt; German ''Recht'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:recht]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Italian ''diritto''.

Many other words related to normative or regulatory concepts derive from this same root, including ''correct'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:correct]]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''regulate'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:regulate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''rex''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rex#latin]]&lt;/ref&gt; (meaning "king"), whence ''regal''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:regal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and thence ''royal''.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:royal]]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise many more geometric terms derive from this same root, such as ''erect'' (as in "upright"),&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:erect]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''rectangle'' (literally "[[right angle]]"),&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rectangle]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''straight''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:straight]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''stretch''.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:stretch]]&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''right'', the English words ''rule''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rule]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ruler'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ruler]]&lt;/ref&gt; deriving still from the same root, have both normative or regulatory and geometric meanings (e.g. a ruler as in a king, or a ruler as in a straightedge).

Several other roots have similar normative and geometric descendants, such as Latin ''norma'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:norma#latin]]&lt;/ref&gt; whence ''[[norm (philosophy)|norm]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:norm]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''normal'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:normal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''normative''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:normative]]&lt;/ref&gt; itself, and also geometric concepts such as ''[[Normal (geometry)|normal vectors]]''; and likewise Greek ''ortho''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ortho]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin ''ordo'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ordo]]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning either "right" or "correct" (as in ''orthodox'', meaning "correct opinion"&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:orthodox]]&lt;/ref&gt;) or "straight" or "perpendicular" (as in ''orthogonal'', meaning "perpendicular angle"&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:orthogonal]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and thence ''order'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:order]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''ordinary'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ordinary]]&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

==History==

[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Magna Carta]]'' or "Great Charter" was one of England's first documents containing commitments by a [[monarch|king]] to his people to respect certain [[law|legal]] rights. It reduced the power of the monarch.]]

[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a painting; the painting is of a written declaration; there are two human images to the left and right; it says "Declaration des droits de l'homme" (declaration of the rights of man)|The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in 1789 in [[France]].]]

The specific enumeration of rights has differed greatly in different periods of history. In many cases, the system of rights promulgated by one group has come into sharp and bitter conflict with that of other groups. In the political sphere, a place in which rights have historically been an important issue, constitutional provisions of various states sometimes address the question of who has what legal rights.

Historically, many notions of rights were [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], with different people granted different rights, and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to respected from his son did not indicate a right from the son to receive a return from that respect; and the [[divine right of kings]], which permitted absolute power over subjects, did not leave a lot of room for many rights for the subjects themselves.&lt;ref name=tws21decfrre&gt;{{cite news

In contrast, modern conceptions of rights have often emphasized [[liberty]] and [[egalitarianism|equality]] as among the most important aspects of rights, as was evident in the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions.

Important documents in the [[political history]] of rights include:

* The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of [[History of Iran|ancient Iran]] established unprecedented principles of human rights in the 6th century BC under [[Cyrus the Great]].

While Magna Carta was originally a set of rules that the king had to follow, and mainly protected the property of aristocratic landowners, today the Magna Carta is seen as the basis of certain rights for ordinary people, such as the right of due process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lepore|first=Jill|date=April 20, 2015|title=The Rule of History: Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, and the hold of time.|url=|journal=New Yorker|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [[Declaration of Arbroath]] (1320; [[Scotland]]) established the right of the people to choose a head of state (see [[popular sovereignty]]).
* The [[Henrician Articles]] (1573; Poland-Lithuania) or King Henry's Articles were a permanent contract that stated the fundamental principles of governance and constitutional law in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, including the rights of the nobility  to elect the king, to meet in parliament whose approval was required to levy taxes and declare war or peace, to religious liberty and the right to rebel in case the king transgressed against the laws of the republic or the rights of the nobility.

* The [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] (1776) by [[George Mason]] declared the inherent natural rights and [[separation of powers]].
* The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] (1776) succinctly defined the rights of man as including, but not limited to, "[[Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness]]" which later influenced "[[liberté, égalité, fraternité]]" (liberty, equality, fraternity) in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Dyck | first = Rand | title = Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches (3rd edition) | publisher = [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]] | year = 2000 | location =  | isbn = 978-0-17-616792-9 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 [[Constitution of Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/1947con.html|title=1947 Japanese Constitution|author=|date=|website=history.hanover.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in President [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s 1945 declaration of independence of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1945vietnam.html|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|author=|date=|website=www.fordham.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative phrase "life, liberty and property", is found in the [[Declaration of Colonial Rights]], a resolution of the [[First Continental Congress]].

* The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] (1789; France), one of the fundamental documents of the [[French Revolution]], defined a set of individual rights and collective rights of the people.
* The [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] (1785; United States), written by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1779, was a document that asserted the right of man to form a personal relationship with God free from interference by the state.
* The [[United States Bill of Rights]] (1789–1791; United States), the first ten amendments of the [[United States Constitution]] specified rights of individuals in which government could not interfere, including the rights of free assembly, freedom of religion, trial by jury, and the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13919">An approach to the [[foundations of mathematics]] that is of relatively recent origin, '''Scott–Potter set theory''' is a collection of nested [[axiomatic set theory|axiomatic set theories]] set out by the [[philosopher]] Michael Potter, building on earlier work by the [[mathematician]] [[Dana Scott]] and the philosopher [[George Boolos]].

Potter (1990, 2004) clarified and simplified the approach of Scott (1974), and showed how the resulting [[axiomatic set theory]] can do what is expected of such theory, namely grounding the [[cardinal number|cardinal]] and [[ordinal number]]s, [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]] and the other usual [[number system]]s, and the theory of [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]].

==ZU etc.==

===Preliminaries===
This section and the next follow Part I of Potter (2004) closely. The background logic is [[first-order logic]] with [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]]. The [[ontology]] includes [[urelement]]s as well as [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], which makes it clear that there can be sets of entities defined by first-order theories not based on sets. The urelements are not essential in that other mathematical structures can be defined as sets, and it is permissible for the set of urelements to be empty.

Some terminology peculiar to Potter's set theory:
* ι is a [[definite description]] operator and binds a variable. (In Potter's notation the iota symbol is inverted.)
* The predicate U holds for all urelements (non-collections).
* ιxΦ(x) exists [[iff]] ([[Uniqueness quantification|∃!x]])Φ(x). (Potter uses Φ and other upper-case Greek letters to represent formulas.)
* {x : Φ(x)} is an abbreviation for  ιy(not U(y) and ([[forall|∀]]x)(x ∈ y ⇔ Φ(x))). 
* ''a'' is a '''collection''' if {''x'' : ''x''∈''a''} exists. (All sets are collections, but not all collections are sets.)
* The '''accumulation''' of ''a'', acc(''a''), is the set {''x'' : ''x'' is a urelement or [[Existential quantification|∃]]''b''∈''a'' (''x''∈''b'' or ''x''⊂''b'')}.
* If ∀''v''∈''V''(''v'' = acc(''V''∩''v'')) then ''V'' is a '''history'''.
* A '''level''' is the accumulation of a history.
* An '''initial level''' has no other levels as members. 
* A '''limit level''' is a level that is neither the initial level nor the level above any other level. 
* A '''set''' is a subcollection of some level.
* The '''birthday''' of set ''a'', denoted ''V''(''a''), is the lowest level ''V'' such that ''a''⊂''V''.

===Axioms===
The following three axioms define the theory '''ZU'''.

'''Creation''': ∀''V''∃''V' ''(''V''∈''V' '').

''Remark'': There is no highest level, hence there are infinitely many levels. This axiom establishes the [[ontology]] of levels.

'''Separation''': An [[axiom schema]]. For any first-order formula Φ(''x'') with (bound) variables ranging over the level ''V'', the collection {''x''∈''V'' : Φ(''x'')} is also a set.  (See [[Axiom schema of separation]].)

''Remark'': Given the levels established by ''Creation'', this schema establishes the existence of sets and how to form them. It tells us that  a level is a set, and all subsets, definable via [[first-order logic]], of levels are also sets. This schema can be seen as an extension of the background logic.

'''Infinity''': There exists at least one limit level.  (See [[Axiom of infinity]].)

''Remark'': Among the sets ''Separation'' allows, at least one is [[Infinity|infinite]]. This axiom is primarily [[mathematical]], as there is no need for the [[actual infinite]] in other human contexts, the human sensory order being necessarily [[Wikt:finite|finite]]. For mathematical purposes, the axiom "There exists an [[inductive set (axiom of infinity)|inductive set]]" would suffice.

===Further existence premises===
The following statements, while in the nature of axioms, are not axioms of '''ZU'''. Instead, they assert the existence of sets satisfying a stated condition. As such, they are "existence premises," meaning the following. Let '''X''' denote any statement below. Any theorem whose proof requires '''X''' is then formulated conditionally as "If '''X''' holds, then..." Potter defines several systems using existence premises, including the following two:
* '''ZfU''' =&lt;sub&gt;'''df'''&lt;/sub&gt;  '''ZU''' + ''Ordinals'';
* '''ZFU''' =&lt;sub&gt;'''df'''&lt;/sub&gt;   ''Separation'' + ''Reflection''.

'''Ordinals''': For each (infinite) ordinal α, there exists a corresponding level ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;.

''Remark'': In words, "There exists a level corresponding to each infinite ordinal." ''Ordinals'' makes possible the conventional [[ordinal number|Von Neumann definition of ordinal numbers]]. 

Let τ(''x'') be a [[first-order logic|first-order term]].

'''[[axiom schema of replacement|Replacement]]''':  An [[axiom schema]]. For any collection ''a'', ∀''x''∈''a''[τ(''x'') is a set] → {τ(''x'') : ''x''∈''a''} is a set.

''Remark'': If the term τ(''x'') is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] (call it ''f''(''x'')), and if the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of ''f'' is a set, then the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of ''f'' is also a set.

'''Reflection''': Let Φ denote a [[first-order logic|first-order formula]] in which any number of [[free variable]]s are present. Let Φ&lt;sup&gt;(''V'')&lt;/sup&gt; denote Φ with these free variables all quantified, with the quantified variables restricted to the level ''V''.

Then ∃''V''[Φ→Φ&lt;sup&gt;(''V'')&lt;/sup&gt;] is an axiom.

''Remark'': This schema asserts the existence of a "partial" universe, namely the level ''V'', in which all properties Φ holding when the quantified variables range over all levels, also hold when these variables range over ''V'' only. ''Reflection'' turns ''Creation'', ''Infinity'', ''Ordinals'', and ''Replacement'' into theorems (Potter 2004: §13.3).

Let ''A'' and ''a'' denote sequences of non[[empty set]]s, each indexed by ''n''.

'''[[axiom of countable choice|Countable Choice]]''': Given any sequence ''A'', there exists a sequence ''a'' such that:
:∀''n''∈ω[''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;∈''A''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;].

''Remark''. ''Countable Choice'' enables proving that any set must be one of finite or infinite.

Let ''B'' and ''C'' denote sets, and let ''n'' index the members of ''B'', each denoted ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''[[axiom of choice|Choice]]''': Let the members of ''B'' be disjoint nonempty sets. Then:
:∃''C''∀''n''[''C''∩''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]].

The [[Von Neumann universe]] implements the "iterative conception of set" by stratifying the universe of sets into a series of "levels," with the sets at a given level being the members of the sets making up the next higher level. Hence the levels form a nested and [[well-ordered]] sequence, and would form a [[hierarchy (mathematics)|hierarchy]] if set membership were [[transitive relation|transitive]]. The resulting iterative conception steers clear, in a well-motivated way, of the well-known [[paradox]]es of [[Russell's paradox|Russell]], [[Burali-Forti paradox|Burali-Forti]], and [[Cantor's paradox|Cantor]]. These paradoxes all result from the unrestricted use of the [[axiom of comprehension|principle of comprehension]] that [[naive set theory]] allows. Collections such as "the class of all sets" or "the class of all ordinals" include sets from all levels of the hierarchy. Given the iterative conception, such collections cannot form sets at any given level of the hierarchy and thus cannot be sets at all. The iterative conception has gradually become more accepted over time, despite an imperfect understanding of its historical origins.

Boolos's (1989) axiomatic treatment of the iterative conception is his set theory  ''S'', a two sorted [[first order logic|first order theory]] involving sets and levels.

===Scott's theory===
Scott (1974) did not mention the "iterative conception of set," instead proposing his theory as a natural outgrowth of the [[type theory|simple theory of types]]. Nevertheless, Scott's theory can be seen as an axiomatization of the iterative conception and the associated iterative hierarchy.

Scott began with an axiom he declined to name: the [[atomic formula]] ''x''∈''y'' implies that ''y'' is a set. In symbols:
:∀''x'',''y''∃''a''[''x''∈''y''→''y''=''a''].
His axiom of ''[[axiom of extensionality|Extensionality]]'' and [[axiom schema]] of ''Comprehension'' ([[axiom of separation|Separation]]) are strictly analogous to their [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] counterparts and so do not mention levels. He then invoked two axioms that do mention levels:
* ''Accumulation''. A given level "accumulates" all members and subsets of all earlier levels. See the above definition of ''accumulation''.
* ''Restriction''. All collections belong to some level.
''Restriction'' also implies the existence of at least one level and assures that all sets are well-founded.

Scott's final axiom, the ''Reflection'' [[axiom schema|schema]], is identical to the above existence premise bearing the same name, and likewise does duty for ZF's ''[[axiom of infinity|Infinity]]'' and ''[[axiom of replacement|Replacement]]''. Scott's system has the same strength as ZF.

===Potter's theory===
Potter (1990, 2004) introduced the idiosyncratic terminology described earlier in this entry, and discarded or replaced all of Scott's axioms except ''Reflection''; the result is '''ZU'''. '''ZU''', like ZF, cannot be finitely axiomatized. '''ZU''' differs from [[ZFC]] in that it:
* Includes no [[axiom of extensionality]] because the usual extensionality principle follows from the definition of collection and an easy lemma.
* Admits [[axiom of foundation|nonwellfounded]] collections. However Potter (2004) never invokes such collections, and all sets (collections which are contained in a level) are wellfounded. No theorem in Potter would be overturned if an axiom stating that all collections are sets were added to '''ZU'''.
*Includes no equivalents of [[axiom of choice|Choice]] or the axiom schema of [[axiom of replacement|Replacement]].

Hence '''ZU''' is closer to the [[Zermelo set theory]] of 1908, namely ZFC minus Choice, [[axiom of replacement|Replacement]], and Foundation. It is stronger than this theory, however, since cardinals and [[ordinal number|ordinals]] can be defined, despite the absence of Choice, using [[Scott's trick]] and the existence of levels, and no such definition is possible in Zermelo set theory. Thus in ZU, an equivalence class of:
*[[Equinumerous]] sets from a common level is a [[cardinal number]];
* [[Isomorphic]] [[well-ordering]]s, also from a common level, is an ordinal number.

Similarly the [[natural number]]s are not defined as a particular set within the iterative hierarchy, but as [[model theory|models]] of a "pure" Dedekind algebra. "Dedekind algebra" is Potter's name for a set closed under a unary [[injective]] operation, [[successor function|successor]], whose [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] contains a unique element, zero, absent from its [[range (mathematics)|range]]. Because the theory of Dedekind algebras is [[categorical theory|categorical]] (all models are [[isomorphic]]), any such algebra can proxy for the natural numbers.

Although Potter (2004) devotes an entire appendix to [[proper class]]es, the strength and merits of Scott–Potter set theory relative to the well-known rivals to ZFC that admit proper classes, namely [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]] and [[Morse–Kelley set theory]], have yet to be explored.

Scott–Potter set theory resembles [[New Foundations|NFU]] in that the latter is a recently (Jensen 1967) devised [[axiomatic set theory]] admitting both [[urelement]]s and sets that are not [[axiom of foundation|well-founded]]. But the urelements of NFU, unlike those of ZU, play an essential role; they and the resulting restrictions on [[axiom of extensionality|Extensionality]] make possible a proof of NFU's [[consistency]] relative to [[Peano arithmetic]]. But nothing is known about the strength of NFU relative to ''Creation''+''Separation'', NFU+''Infinity'' relative to ZU, and of NFU+''Infinity''+''Countable Choice'' relative to ZU + ''Countable Choice''.

Unlike nearly all writing on set theory in recent decades, Potter (2004) mentions [[mereology|mereological fusions]]. His ''collections'' are also synonymous with the "virtual sets" of [[Willard Quine]] and [[Richard Milton Martin]]: entities arising from the free use of the [[set builder notation|principle of comprehension]] that can never be admitted to the [[universe of discourse]].

{{Sex differences}}
'''Sex differences in humans''' have been studied in a variety of fields. In humans, [[biological sex]] is determined by five factors present at birth: the presence or absence of a [[Y chromosome]], the type of [[gonad]]s, the [[Sex steroid|sex hormones]], the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the [[uterus]]), and the [[Human genitalia|external genitalia]].&lt;ref name="KnoxSchacht2011"&gt;Knox, David; Schacht, Caroline. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iVOXAp27iQkC&amp;pg=PT64 Choices in Relationships: An Introduction to Marriage and the Family]''. 11 ed. Cengage Learning; 2011-10-10 [cited 17 June 2013]. {{ISBN|9781111833220}}. p. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Genetic sex]] is determined solely by the presence or absence of a Y chromosome. 

Sex differences generally refer to traits that are [[sexually dimorphic]]. A subset of such differences is hypothesized to be the product of the evolutionary process of [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name="Mealey, L. 2000"&gt;Mealey, L.  (2000). Sex differences. NY: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geary, D. C. (2009) Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences.  Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
{{main|Sex differences in medicine}}
Sex differences in medicine include sex-specific diseases, which are [[disease]]s that occur ''only'' in people of one [[sex]]; and sex-related diseases, which are diseases that are more usual to one sex, or which manifest differently in each sex. For example, certain [[autoimmune disease]]s may occur predominantly in one sex, for unknown reasons. 90% of [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] cases are women, whereas [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] is more common in men. Gender-based medicine, also called "gender medicine", is the field of medicine that studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease. Traditionally, medical research has mostly been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. Similar findings are also reported in the sport medicine literature where males typically account for &gt;60% of the individuals studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Where are all the female participants in Sports and Exercise Medicine research?|journal = European Journal of Sport Science|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1536-7290|pmid = 24766579|pages = 847–851|volume = 14|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17461391.2014.911354|first = Joseph T.|last = Costello|first2 = Francois|last2 = Bieuzen|first3 = Chris M.|last3 = Bleakley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients. More recently, medical research has started to understand the importance of taking the sex into account as the symptoms and responses to medical treatment may be very different between sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.columbia-stmarys.org/19301.cfm |title=Women, Men, and Medicine: We're Not Equal |author1=Cuozzo, Karen |author2=Bratman, Steven (reviewer) |publisher=EBSCO Publishing |date=September 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710061518/http://www.columbia-stmarys.org/19301.cfm |archivedate=July 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither concept should be confused with [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, which are diseases that have a significant probability of transmission through sexual contact.

Sex-related illnesses have various causes:{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* [[Sex-linked]] genetic illnesses
* Parts of the [[reproductive system]] that are specific to one sex
* Social causes that relate to the [[gender role]] expected of that sex in a particular society.
* Different levels of prevention, reporting, diagnosis or treatment in each gender.

==Physiology==
{{main|Sex differences in human physiology}}
Sex differences in human physiology are distinctions of physiological characteristics associated with either male or female humans. These can be of several types, including direct and indirect. Direct being the direct result of differences prescribed by the Y-chromosome, and indirect being a characteristic influenced indirectly (e.g., hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is a term for the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] difference between males and females of the same species.

Direct sex differences follow a [[bimodal distribution]]. Through the process of [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]] (with rare exceptions), each individual is created with zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are usually binary in expression (although the deviations in complex biological processes produce a menagerie of exceptions). These include, most conspicuously, male (vs female) [[gonads]].

Indirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by [[empirical data]] and [[statistics|statistical]] analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a [[bell distribution|bell-curve]] (i.e., normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean (peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions. For example, most [[males]] are taller and stronger than [[females]],&lt;ref name="Gustafsson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustafsson A, Lindenfors P|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | title=Human size evolution: no allometric relationship between male and female stature | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=47 | pages=253–266 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.07.004 | pmid=15454336 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but an individual female could be taller and stronger than an individual male. The extents of these differences vary across societies.&lt;ref name="Birke, Lydia 2001"&gt;Birke, Lydia. The Gender and Science Reader ed. Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch. New York, Routledge, 2001. 306-322&lt;/ref&gt;

The most obvious differences between males and females include all the features related to reproductive role, notably the endocrine (hormonal) systems and their physiological and behavioral effects, including gonadal differentiation, internal and external genital and breast differentiation, and differentiation of muscle mass, height, and hair distribution. There are also differences in the structure of specific areas of the [[Human brain|brain]]. For example, on average, the [[Sexually dimorphic nucleus|SDN]] ([[INAH 3|INAH3]] in humans) has been repeatedly found to be considerably larger in males than in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savic|first=Ivanka|last2=Garcia-Falgueras|first2=Alicia|last3=Swaab|first3=Dick F.|date=2010-01-01|title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain in relation to gender identity and sexual orientation|journal=Progress in Brain Research|volume=186|pages=41–62|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-53630-3.00004-X|issn=1875-7855|pmid=21094885|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=9780444536303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
{{main|Sex differences in human psychology}}
Research on biological sex differences in human psychology investigates cognitive and behavioral differences between [[men]] and [[women]]. This research employs experimental tests of [[cognition]], which take a variety of forms. Tests focus on possible differences in areas such as [[IQ]], spatial reasoning, [[aggression]], [[emotion]], and brain structure and function.

Chromosomal make up is important in human psychology. Women have two X chromosomes while males have an X and Y chromosomal structure. The X chromosome is much more active than Y and it affects behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Heredity Theory Says Intelligence in Males is 'Like Mother, Like Son'|last = Tanoyouye|first = Elyse|journal = Wall Street Journal|date =June 28, 1996|pmid = |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic researchers theorize that the X chromosome may contain a gene responsible for sociability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB866070665214215000 |title = Hey guys, for your next party, try borrowing women's genes|last = Langreth|first = Robert|date = 1997|journal = Wall Street Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2018}}

Most IQ tests are constructed so that there are no overall score differences between females and males. Areas where differences have been found include verbal and mathematical ability.&lt;ref name="lrainc.com"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.77| year = 1996| last1 = Neisser | first1 = U.| last2 = Boodoo | first2 = G.| last3 = Bouchard | first3 = T.

Because social and environmental factors affect brain activity and behavior, where differences are found, it can be difficult for researchers to assess whether or not the differences are [[innate]]. Studies on this topic explore the possibility of social influences on how both sexes perform in cognitive and behavioral tests. [[Stereotype]]s about differences between men and women have been shown to affect a person's behavior (this is called [[stereotype threat]]).&lt;ref name="Fine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine|first=Cordelia|authorlink=Cordelia Fine|title = [[Delusions of Gender|Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference]]| publisher =W.

In his book titled ''Gender, Nature, and Nurture'', psychologist Richard Lippa found that there were large differences in women's and men's preferences for realistic occupations (for example, mechanic or carpenters) and moderate differences in their preferences for social and artistic occupations. His results also found that women tend to be more people-oriented and men more thing-oriented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lippa|first=Richard A.|title=Gender, nature, and nurture|year=2005|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Mahwah, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=0-8058-5344-8|pages=12–44|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartung &amp; Widiger (1998) found that many kinds of mental illnesses and behavioral problems show gender differences in prevalence and incidence. "Of the 80 disorders diagnosed in adulthood for which sex ratios are provided, 35 are said to be more common in men than in women (17 of which are substance related or a [[paraphilia]]), 31 are said to be more common in women than men, and 14 are said to be equally common in both sexes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartung|first=CM|author2=Widiger, TA |title=Gender differences in the diagnosis of mental disorders: conclusions and controversies of the DSM-IV.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=May 1998|volume=123|issue=3|pages=260–78|pmid=9602559|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.123.3.260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in male and female jealousy can also be observed. While female jealousy is more likely to be inspired by emotional infidelity, male jealousy is most likely to be brought on by sexual infidelity. A clear majority of approximately 62% to 86% of women reported that they would be more bothered by emotional infidelity and 47% to 60% of men reported that they would be more bothered by sexual infidelity.&lt;ref name="Pietrzak 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pietrzak, Laird, Stevens, Thompson|first=Robert, James, David, Nicholas|title=Sex differences in human jealousy: A coordinated study of forced-choice, continuous rating-scale, and physiological responses on the same subjects|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=March 2002|pages=83–94|url=http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/10905138/v23i0002/83_sdihj|accessdate=21 March 2013|doi=10.1016/s1090-5138(01)00078-2|volume=23|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Janet Shibley Hyde]] from the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] introduced the gender similarities hypothesis, which suggests that males and females are similar on most, but not all, psychological variables. The research focused on cognitive variables (for example, reading comprehension, mathematics), communication (for example, talkativeness, facial expressions), social and personality (for example, aggression, sexuality), psychological well-being, and motor behaviors. Using results from a review of 46 meta-analyses, she found that 78% of gender differences were small or close to zero. A few exceptions were some motor behaviors (such as throwing distance) and some aspects of sexuality (such as attitudes about casual sex), which show the largest gender differences. She concludes her article by stating: "It is time to consider the costs of overinflated claims of gender differences. Arguably, they cause harm in numerous realms, including women’s opportunities in the workplace, couple conflict and communication, and analyses of self-esteem problems among adolescents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyde|first=Janet Shibley|title=The Gender Similarities Hypothesis|journal=American Psychologist|date=September 2005|volume=60|issue=6|pages=581–592|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.60.6.581|pmid=16173891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyde also stated elsewhere that "variations ''within'' genders are greater than variations ''between'' genders."&lt;ref name=tugend&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tugend|first1=Alina|title=Engendering Sons|journal=[[California (magazine)|California]]|url=http://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/winter-2014-gender-assumptions|issue=Winter 2014|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Irina Trofimova&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trofimova|first=Irina|title=A study of the dynamics of sex differences in adulthood. |journal=[[International Journal of Psychology]] |date= 2012|volume=47|issue=|pages=47, 1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported “middle age – middle sex” phenomenon and suggested that the significant female advantage in verbal fluency and male advantage in physical power fade after age 25 in an asymmetric manner. She pointed out to several other studies on humans and other primates showing a levelling of sex differences in sociability and physical strength. Males and females might indeed have different timings of maturation of physical and verbal systems: according to McGuinness and Pribram (1978) during the first two years of life talking and walking rarely occur simultaneously, which suggests that these two abilities compete for the same set of neural connections, or that one type of neural organization inhibits the other. This coincides with the higher mobility of boys, accompanied by their lower rates of speech development in childhood, in comparison to girls. These different timings in maturation appear as sex differences in early age, and likely level off in later adulthood (Barbu, Cabanes, &amp; Le Maner-Idrissi, 2011). This middle age – middle sex phenomenon might explain why meta-analytic reports and several experimental studies of verbal abilities and dominance using adult participants reported no sex differences.

Statistics have been consistent in reporting that men commit more criminal acts than women.&lt;ref name="Carrabine"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Eamonn Carrabine, Paul Iganski, Maggy Lee|title=Criminology: A Sociological Introduction|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=0415281679|year=2004|page=88|accessdate=August 7, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJm4AIc4sZEC&amp;pg=PA88|quote=Statistics repeatedly show that many more men than women commit crimes.

Some differing explanations include men's [[evolutionary]] tendency toward risk and violent behavior, sex differences in activity, [[social support]], and [[gender inequality]].

Despite the difficulty of interpreting them, [[crime statistics]] may provide a way to investigate such a relationship from a [[gender differences]] perspective. An observable difference in crime rates between men and women might be due to social and cultural factors, crimes going unreported, or to biological factors (for example, [[testosterone]] or sociobiological theories). Taking the nature of the crime itself into consideration may also be a factor. Crime can be measured by such data as arrest records, imprisonment rates, and surveys. However, not all crimes are reported or investigated. Moreover, some studies show that men can have an overwhelming bias against reporting themselves to be the victims of a crime (particularly when victimized by a woman), and some studies have argued that men reporting [[intimate partner violence]] find disadvantageous biases in law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;"[M]en who are involved in disputes with their partners, whether as alleged victims or as alleged offenders or both, are disadvantaged and treated less favorably than women by the law-enforcement system at almost every step."

===Education===
{{main|Sex differences in education}}
[[File:Map3.7Education Discrepancy compressed.jpg|right|thumb| 400px| A world map showing countries by gender education disparity, 2010.]]
Sometimes and in some places, there are sex differences in educational achievement. This may be caused by [[sexism|sex discrimination]] in law or culture, or may reflect natural differences in the interests of the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Jennifer. "Gender, Education and." Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. Ritzer, George (ed). Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Blackwell Reference Online. 31 March 2008 &lt;http://www.blackwellreference.com/subscriber/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g978140512433113_ss1-16&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
{{main|Sex differences in leadership}}
Research has been undertaken to examine whether or not there are sex differences in leadership. Until recently, leadership positions have predominantly been held by men. Women were rarely seen in senior [[leadership]] positions leading to a lack of data on how they behave in such positions.&lt;ref name="Ascited"&gt;as cited in {{cite journal | last1 = Andersen | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Hansson | first2 = P. H. | year = 2011 | title = At the end of the road? On differences between women and men in leadership behavior | url = | journal = Leadership and Organization Development Journal | volume = 32 | issue = 5| pages = 428–441 | doi=10.1108/01437731111146550}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main lines of research contradict one another, the first being that there are significant sex differences in leadership and the second being that gender does not have an effect on leadership.

Women and men have been surveyed by Gallup each year concerning workplace topics, and when questioned about preferences of a female boss or a male boss, women chose a preference for a male boss 39% of the time, compared to 26% of men displaying preference for a male boss.  Only 27% of females would prefer a boss of the same gender.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-16/women-dislike-having-female-bosses-more-than-men-do Women Prefer Male Bosses Even More Than Men Do] Bloomberg, October 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  This preference, among both sexes, for male leadership in the workplace has continued unabated for sixty years, according to the survey results.

===Religion===
{{main|Sex differences in religion}}
Sex differences in religion can be classified as either "internal" or "external." Internal religious issues are studied from the perspective of a given religion, and might include religious beliefs and practices about the roles and rights of men and women in government, education and worship; beliefs about the sex or gender of deities and religious figures; and beliefs about the origin and meaning of human gender. External religious issues can be broadly defined as an examination of a given religion from an outsider's perspective, including possible clashes between religious leaders and laity;&lt;ref&gt;Juschka, Darlene. "Gender." In ed. J. Hinnels. The Routledge Companion to the Study of Religion. 2nd ed.  New York: Routledge, 2010:245-258.&lt;/ref&gt; and the influence of, and differences between, religious perspectives on social issues. For example, various religious perspectives have either endorsed or condemned alternative family structures, homosexual relationships, and abortion.&lt;ref&gt;

===Social capital===
{{main|Sex differences in social capital}}
Sex differences in social capital are differences between men and women in their ability to coordinate actions and achieve their aims through trust, norms and networks.&lt;ref name=laurie&gt;Laurie, Nina; Andolina, Robert; and Radcliffe, Sarah (2005) 'Ethnodevelopment: Social Movements, Creating Experts and Professionalising Indigenous Knowledge in Ecuador' Antipode 37(3): 470-496&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social capital]] is often seen as the missing link in development; as social networks facilitate access to resources and protect the commons, while cooperation makes markets work more efficiently.&lt;ref name="putnam"&gt;Putnam, Robert. (1993) Making Democracy Work. Civic Traditions in Modern Italy. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Social capital has been thought of as women's capital as whereas there are gendered barriers to accessing economic capital, women's role in family, and community ensures that they have strong networks. There is potential that the concept can help to bring women's unpaid 'community and household labor',&lt;ref name=moser&gt;Moser, Caroline (1993) Gender Planning and Development: Theory, Practice and Training London and New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; vital to survival and development, to the attention of economists. However, research analyzing social capital from a gendered perspective is rare, and the notable exceptions are very critical.&lt;ref name=molyneux&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7660.2010.01649.x/abstract |title=Molyneux, Maxine (2002) Gender and the Silences of Social Capital: Lessons from Latin America Development and Change 33 (2):167-188 |journal=Development and Change |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=495 |publisher=Onlinelibrary.wiley.com |date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2014-01-15|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7660.2010.01649.x |last1=MacLean |first1=Kate }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maclean&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7660.2010.01649.x/abstract |title=Maclean, Kate (2010) 'Capitalising on Women's Social Capital?

===Suicide===
{{main|Sex differences in suicide}}
Sex differences in suicide have been shown to be significant; there are highly asymmetric rates of attempted and completed suicide between males and females.&lt;ref name=udry&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2061790 |first1=J.

===Financial risk-taking===

Sex differences in financial decision making are relevant and significant. Numerous studies have found that women tend to be financially more risk-averse than men and hold safer [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bajtelsmit| first1 = Vickie L | last2 = Bernasek| first2 = Alexandra| year = 1996| title = Why Do Women Invest Differently Than Men?| journal = Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning | volume = 7| pages = 1–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adhikari| first1 = Binay K | last2 = O'Leary| first2 = Virginia E | year = 2011| title = Gender Differences in Risk Aversion: A Developing Nation’s Case| url = https://www.dropbox.com/s/ehk7iwzukwu0kw4/Gender%20Differences%20Risk%20Aversion%20-%20Nepal.pdf?dl=0  | journal = Journal of Personal Finance | volume = 10|issue = 2| pages = 122–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; A May 3, 2015 article in the Wall Street Journal by Georgette Jasen reported that "when it comes to investing, men sometimes have their way of doing things, and women have different ways."&lt;ref&gt;Georgette Jasen, May 3, 2015, WSJ online.  https://www.wsj.com/articles/male-investors-vs-female-investors-how-do-they-compare-1430709406&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly research has documented systematic differences in financial decisions such as buying investments versus insurance, donating to ingroups versus outgroups (such as terrorism victims in Iraq versus USA), spending in stores,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kurt | first1 = Didem | last2 = Inman | first2 = J.

"The duality of human existence: An essay on psychology and religion." (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; according to this theory, due to factors such as socialization, males are typically more agentic (focus on self, upside potential, aggressiveness) and females typically more communal (focus on others, downside potential, and nurturing). This framework robustly explains many financial decision making outcomes.

[[Image:Sapta Chakra, 1899.jpg|220px|thumb|right|The subtle body in Indian mysticism, from a [[Yoga]] manuscript in Braj Bhasa language, 1899, now in the British Library.]]

A '''subtle body''' is one of a series of psycho-spiritual constituents of living beings, according to various [[esotericism|esoteric]], [[occultism|occult]], and [[mysticism|mystical]] teachings. According to such beliefs each subtle body corresponds to a subtle [[plane of existence]], in a [[hierarchy]] or [[great chain of being]] that culminates in the physical form.

According to ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', one of the most sacred texts of [[Hinduism]], the subtle body is composed of mind, intelligence and ego, which controls the gross physical body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/13/6-7|title=Bg 13.6-7|first=|last=pnd|date=15 July 2011|website=www.vedabase.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503130040/http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/13/6-7|archivedate=3 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known in other different spiritual traditions: "the most sacred body" (''wujud al-aqdas'') and "true and genuine body" (''jism asli haqiqi'') in [[Sufism]], "the diamond body" in [[Taoism]] and [[Vajrayana]], "the light body" or "[[rainbow body]]" in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], "the body of bliss" in [[Kriya Yoga]], and "the immortal body" (''soma athanaton'') in [[Hermeticism]].&lt;ref&gt;White.&lt;/ref&gt; The various attributes of the subtle body are frequently described in terms of often obscure [[symbol]]ism: Tantra features references to the sun and moon as well as various Indian rivers and deities, while Taoist alchemy speaks of [[dantian|cauldrons]] and cinnabar fields.

==History of the term==
The expression "subtile body" appears suddenly in English literature in about 1650, appears erratically until it ceased to be used by about 1840.  At that time, the more common term "subtle body" comes into use.  The latter expression gradually gains in currency through the nineteenth century, and begins a sharp increase in usage from about 1940 until the present time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Google N-Gram|title=N-Gram Analysis, "subtile body, subtle body"|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=subtile+body%2Csubtle+body&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1500&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Csubtile%20body%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bsubtile%20body%3B%2Cc0%3B%3Bsubtile%20Body%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2Csubtle%20body%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bsubtle%20body%3B%2Cc0%3B%3Bsubtle%20Body%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BSubtle%20Body%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BSubtle%20body%3B%2Cc0|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research is needed to clarify the actual authors who used the phrase, and what they meant by it.  But the word may have a connection with the Sanskrit Sūkṣma (subtle, unmanifest, dormant) Śarīra (body) which is described in the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Three Bodies Doctrine (Vedanta)#Suksma sarira - subtle body]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asian religions==
[[Image:Acupuncture chart 300px.jpg|thumb|200px|''Drawing showing the circulation of Qi energy, Ming Dynasty'']]

The [[Yoga|Yogic]], [[tantra|Tantric]] and other systems of [[Hinduism]], [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]], as well as Chinese [[Taoist alchemy]] contain theories of subtle physiology having a number of focal points ([[chakra]]s, [[acupuncture points]]) connected by a series of channels ([[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]], [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]]) that convey subtle breath ([[prana]], vayu, [[Qi|ch'i, ki]], [[lung (Tibetan Buddhism)|lung]]).

These invisible channels and points are understood to determine the characteristics of the visible physical form. By understanding and mastering the subtlest levels of reality one gains mastery over the physical realm. Through practice of various breathing and visualization exercises one is able to manipulate and direct the flow of vital force, to achieve supernormal powers ''(''[[Sanskrit]]: ''[[siddhi]]s)'' and attain higher [[Altered state of consciousness|states of consciousness]], [[immortality]], or [[Moksha|liberation]].

=== Hinduism ===
[[File:SahajaSubtleSystem.svg|thumb|An illustration of a subtle body system of seven chakras commonly adopted by contemporary yoga.]]
Early mentions of subtle body ([[Sanskrit]]: ''sūkṣma śarīra'') concepts appear in the Upanishads, particularly the earliest known theory appears in the [[Taittiriya Upanishad]]'s (circa 4th or 5th centuries BCE) theory of five bodies or selves.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The Taittiriya differentiates between five increasingly subtle body/selves: &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* The ''anna-maya'' ("food body", physical body/self), 
* The ''prana-maya'' (body made of vital breath or [[prana]]), 
* The ''mano-maya'' (body made of mind), 
* The ''[[Vijñāna|vijñana]]-maya'' (body made of consciousness)
* The ''ananda-maya'' (bliss body). 
The Taittiriya also contains passages which suggests a theory of a subtle internal anatomy which includes the concept of a central channel ([[Nadi (yoga)|nadi]]).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In later Vedic texts called [[Samhita|samhitas]] and [[Brahmana|brahmanas]] one also finds a theory of five "winds" or "breaths" (''vayus, [[Prana|pranas]]''):&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Prāṇa'', associated with inhalation
* ''Apāna'', associated with exhalation
* ''Uḍāna'', associated with distribution of breath within the body
* ''Samāna'', associated with digestion
* ''Vyāna'', associated with excretion of waste
A millennium later, these concepts were adapted and refined by various spiritual traditions. The similar concept of the {{IAST|Liṅga Śarīra}} is seen as the vehicle of consciousness in later [[Samkhya]], [[Vedanta]], and [[Yoga]], and is propelled by past-life tendencies, or ''[[bhava]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gerald. ''Classical Samkhya'' p.242&lt;/ref&gt; Linga can be translated as "characteristic mark" or "impermanence" and the term [[Sarira (Vedanta)]] as "form" or "mold".&lt;ref&gt;Purucker, Gottfried. ''The Occult Glossary''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karana'' or "instrument" is a synonymous term. In the Classical Samkhya system of [[Isvarakrsna]] (ca. 4th century CE), the ''Lińga'' is the characteristic mark of the transmigrating entity. It consists of twenty-five [[tattva]]s from eternal consciousness down to the five organs of sense, five of activity (''buddindriya'' or ''jñānendriya'', and  ''karmendriya'' respectively) and the five subtle elements that are the objects of sense (''tanmatras'') The ''Samkhyakarika'' says:{{quote|The subtle body (''linga''), previously arisen, unconfined, constant, inclusive of the great one (''mahat'') etc , through the subtle elements, not having enjoyment, transmigrates, (because of) being endowed with ''bhavas'' ("conditions" or "dispositions").

As a picture (does) not (exist) without a support, or as a shadow (does) not (exist) without a post and so forth; so too the instrument (''linga'' or ''karana'') does not exist without that which is specific (i.e. a subtle body).&lt;ref&gt;Samkhyakarika, transl. Gerald Larson, vv 60-81, ''Classical Samkhya'' p.268.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The classical [[Vedanta]] tradition developed the theory of the five bodies into the theory of the [[Kosha|koshas]] "sheaths" or "coverings" which surround and obscure the self ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]). In classical Vedanta these are seen as obstacles to realization and traditions like Shankara's [[Advaita Vedanta]] had little interest in working with the subtle body.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 34, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tantra]] traditions meanwhile ([[Shaivism|Shaiva]] [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] and Buddhist yoga), the subtle body was seen in a more positive light, offering potential for yogic practices which could lead to liberation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Tantric traditions contain the most complex theories of the subtle body, with sophisticated descriptions of energy [[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]] (literally "stream or river", channels through which ''vayu'' and ''prana'' flows) and [[chakra]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (lit. "circles") which are points of focus where nadis meet.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; The main channels, shared by both Hindu and Buddhist systems, are the central (in Hindu systems: ''susumna''; in Buddhist: ''avadhuti''), left and right (in Hindu systems: ''ida'' and ''pingala''; Buddhist: ''lalana'' and ''rasana'').&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Further subsidiary channels are said to radiate outwards from the chakras, where the main channels meet. There are various chakra systems depending on the [[tantra]]; the ''Netra tantra'' describes six chakras, the ''Kaulajñana-nirnay''a describes eight, and the ''Kubjikamata Tantra'' describes seven (the most widely known set of chakras).&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, Indian subtle body terminology was adopted by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] of [[Madame Blavatsky]].

The modern Indian spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] stated that the subtle body "is the vehicle of desires and vital forces,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''2'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 145. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He held that the subtle body is one of three bodies with which the soul must cease to identify in order to realize God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''2'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 144. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chakras and energy channels 2 (3749594497).jpg|thumb|200px|A Tibetan illustration of the subtle body showing the central channel and two side channels as well as five chakras.]]

In [[Buddhist Tantra]], the subtle body is termed the ‘innate body’
(''nija-deha'') or the ‘uncommon means body’ (''asadhdrana-upayadeha'').&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Wayman, Alex; Yoga of the Guhyasamajatantra: The arcane lore of forty verses : a Buddhist Tantra commentary, 1977, page 65.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called ''sūkṣma śarīra'', rendered in Tibetan as ''traway-lu'' (transliterated ''phra ba’i lus''). &lt;ref&gt;Lama Willa B Miller. Reviews: Investigating the Subtle Body. {{cite web |url=https://www.lionsroar.com/reviews-investigating-the-subtle-body/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-03-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319151239/https://www.lionsroar.com/reviews-investigating-the-subtle-body/ |archivedate=19 March 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The subtle body consists of thousands of subtle energy channels ([[nadis]]), which are conduits for energies or "winds" ([[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)|lung]] or [[prana]]) and converge at [[chakras]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;  
According to Dagsay Tulku Rinpoche, there are three mains channels (''nadis''), central, left and right; "their beginning point is located between a person's eyebrows. From there, they run upward to the crown chakra. The passage then parallels the spine, running through all seven chakras - the centers of subtle energy - and ending about two inches below the belly button."&lt;ref&gt;Dagsay Tulku Rinpoche, The Practice of Tibetan Meditation: Exercises, Visualizations, and Mantras for Health and Well-being. Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co, 2002, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; 

Buddhist tantras generally describe four or five chakras in the shape of a lotus with varying petals. For example, the [[Hevajra Tantra]] (8th century) states:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Center [i.e. cakra] of Creation [at the sexual organ] a sixty-four petal lotus. In the Center of Essential Nature [at the heart] an eight petal lotus. In the Center of Enjoyment [at the throat] a sixteen petal lotus. In the Center of Great Bliss [at the top of the head] a thirty-two petal lotus.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In contrast, the historically later [[Kalachakra|Kalachakra tantra]] describes six chakras.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, liberation is achieved through subtle body processes during [[Deity yoga|Completion Stage]] practices such as the [[Six Yogas of Naropa|Six yogas of Naropa]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Western esotericism ==
=== Theosophy ===

[[H. P. Blavatsky]]'s [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] teaching represented the convergence of 19th century Western occultism, Eastern philosophy, religion, science, and mysticism. ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', and ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'' combined the [[vedanta|Vedantic]] concept of five [[kosha]]s with Western esoteric traditions (particularly [[Neoplatonism]]).  She refers to three subtle bodies:

* ''[[Linga sarira|Linga Sharira]]'' - the Double or [[Astral body]]
* ''Mayavi-rupa'' - the "Illusion-body"
* ''Causal Body'' - the vehicle of the higher Mind

The ''Linga Sharira'' is the invisible double of the human body, elsewhere referred to as the [[etheric body]], [[doppelgänger]] or bioplasmic body and serves as a model or matrix of the physical body, which conforms to the shape, appearance and condition of his "double". The linga sarira can be separated or projected a limited distance from the body. When separated from the body it can be wounded by sharp objects. When it returns to the physical frame, the wound will be reflected in the physical counterpart, a phenomenon called "repercussion". At death, it is discarded together with the physical body and eventually disintegrates or decomposes.

The mayavi-rupa is dual in its functions, being:
"the vehicle both of thought and of the animal passions and desires, drawing at one and the same time from the lowest terrestrial manas (mind) and Kama, the element of desire".&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Blavatsky, "Astral Bodies, or Doppelgangers". ''Collected Writings'' X, pp. 217–220&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher part of this body, containing the spiritual elements gathered during life, merges after death entirely into the causal body; while the lower part, containing the animal elements, forms the Kama-rupa, the source of "spooks" or [[ghost|apparitions]] of the dead.

[[File:First Principles of Thesophy 066.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Vehicles of the Soul according to the Theosophist [[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa]].]]

[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] was further systematized in the writings of [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Annie Besant]]. For example, they divided Blavatsky's dual mayavi-rupa into two different bodies: the emotional and the mental bodies.  They also redefined some terms. The Linga Sarira (sometimes called astral body by Blavatsky) was denominated by [[Annie Besant]]&lt;ref&gt;Annie Besant, ''The Ancient Wisdom'', 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Etheric body|Etheric double]]. [[C.W. Leadbeater]], regarding the emotional body as the seat of the [[Kama (Theosophy)|kamic]] principle of Blavatsky's constitution, denominated it [[astral body]]. Therefore, the subtle bodies in a human being are:

* [[Etheric body]] (vehicle of [[prana]])
* [[Astral body|Emotional or astral body]] (vehicle of desires and emotions)
* [[Mental body]] (vehicle of the concrete or lower mind)
* [[Causal body]] (vehicle of the abstract or higher mind)

Each "body" has its own [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] and set of [[chakra]]s, and corresponds to a particular [[Plane (cosmology)|plane of existence]].

[[Image:Cosmicman.jpg|thumb|116px|left|The Subtle body and the cosmic man, Nepal 1600s]]

=== Post-theosophists ===

The later Theosophical arrangement was taken up by [[Alice Bailey]], and from there found its way (with variations) into the New Age worldview. It is also associated with the human [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] observed through [[Kirlian photography]] and [[Walter John Kilner|Kilner screens]]. The [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophical view of the human being]] found in [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s [[Anthroposophical]] teachings usually referred to only the Etheric and Astral Bodies. However, Steiner also used a threefold classification of body, soul, and spirit as well as a sevenfold and a ninefold description.

[[Max Heindel]] divided the subtle body into: [[Etheric body|Vital Body]] made of Ether, our instrument for specializing the vital energy of the sun, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about an inch and a half outside the body; the [[Desire body]], which is our emotional nature and pervades both the vital and dense bodies, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about 16&amp;nbsp;inches outside our visible body, related to the [[Astral plane|Desire World]]; and the [[Mental body]], which functions like a mirror, reflects the outer world and enables the Ego to transmit its commands as thought, word and action. The human being is seen as a threefold Spirit, possessing a Mind by which he governs the threefold Body that he transmutes into a threefold [[Soul]]. The Human Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the desire body to be transmuted into the Emotional Soul; the Life Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the vital body to be transmuted into the Intellectual Soul; the Divine Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the dense body to be transmuted into the Conscious Soul.

[[Samael Aun Weor]] wrote extensively on the subtle vehicles, organizing them in accordance with the [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. The common person only contains the lunar vehicles of emotion ([[astral body]]), thought ([[mental body]]), and will ([[causal body]]), concentrations of the collective animalistic intelligence, the evolution of the Essence through the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms. Becoming human means to have a soul, a Solar Astral Body, Solar Mental Body and Solar Causal Body. These bodies are constructed through a form of [[Tantra]] called [[White tantrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Samael Aun Weor |authorlink=Samael Aun Weor |title=Types of Spiritual Schools |url=http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/417/64/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531203308/http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/417/64/ |archivedate=31 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Note: The "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012401/http://www.gnosticteachings.org/component/option,com_glossary/func,view/Itemid,10077/catid,101/term,Ego/ ego]" referred to by Samael Aun Weor is not used in the same context as it is used other esoteric schools.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Brennan]]'s account of the subtle bodies in her books ''Hands of Light'' and ''Light Emerging'' refers to the subtle bodies as "layers" in the "Human Energy Field" or aura. Causality proceeds downwards: each of the layers has its own characteristics and can have its own expression of disease, requiring individual healing. As with the Adyar arrangement, each body or aura also has its own complement of chakras, which interrelate to those in the other layers.

Michal Levin describes the relationship between the energy bodies and the chakras in her book Meditation, Path to the Deepest Self.

=== Fourth Way ===

An interesting variant on the concept of subtle bodies is found in both Alchemical Taoism and the "[[Fourth Way]]" teachings of [[Gurdjieff]] and [[Ouspensky]], where it is said that one can create a subtle body, and hence achieve post-mortem immortality, through spiritual or yogic exercises. The "soul" then is not something one is born with, but something that one has to develop through esoteric practice.

According to (Rosenthal, 1997) "In Gurdjieff's cosmology our nature is tripartite and is composed of the physical (planetary), emotional (astral) and mental (spiritual) bodies; in each person one of these three bodies ultimately achieves dominance." The Fourth way as taught by [[Gurdjieff]] and [[Ouspensky]] is a philosophy of developing the divine body which is gained when one has complete understanding and self perfection. The ultimate task of the fourth way teachings is to harmoniously develop the four bodies into a single way.&lt;ref&gt;Bernice Glatzer Rosenthal ''The occult in Russian and Soviet culture'' 1997, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aleister Crowley and the Body of Light ==

The work of the ''Body of Light'' was part of English author and [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]]'s system of [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]], saying in his ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'' that it must be developed by rigid discipline, including rituals and the "assumption of god-forms", as well as by practice and experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleister Crowley]] ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'', [[Samuel Weiser]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From Crowley's ''[[Magick Without Tears]]'' (Ch. 81):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''One passes through the veil of the exterior world (which, as in Yoga, but in another sense, becomes "unreal" by comparison as one passes beyond) one creates a subtle body (instrument is a better term) called the body of Light; this one develops and controls; it gains new powers as one progresses, usually by means of what is called "initiation:" finally, one carries on almost one's whole life in this Body of Light, and achieves in its own way the mastery of the Universe.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Sustainable redevelopment''' is the [[doctrine]] within which a state, organization, or individual can work to recreate a [[Socio-economic status|socio-economic position]] attained prior to a deconstructive event while upholding sustainable and environmental practices. The doctrine is based on [[economics]] within [[environmentalism]]. Typically, by providing more upfront capital, one can create a system that is less energy intensive, less wasteful, and generally less expensive to maintain in the long run.&lt;ref name="DFD"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd/dsd_index.shtml |title=Division for Sustainable Development :: About |author=[[United Nations]] |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By redeveloping sustainably, long term [[energy conservation|energy efficiencies]] can be realized, coupled with highly reduced [[greenhouse gas emissions]].

Within the ideals of [[nation-building]], sustainable redevelopment can take up a greater significance. Post-[[disaster]] countries are in a unique situation to deal with these systems of ideals. Within this context, the idea behind initiating post-trauma sustainable redevelopment is that the underlying [[infrastructure]] is destroyed or damaged, therefore the situation is ideal for realizing the opportunities inherent to the situation.

==Background==
[[Sustainable development]] and [[redevelopment]] are closely linked, and several organizations have been implicitly involved with sustainable development. This type of development, in contrast to redevelopment, is not different other than the application to a specified problem. Sustainable development, is a form of development that coexists with existing forms of development.

While the systems for recreation on a small/local level are not universally widespread, there are several institutions which engage in sustainable development, that can theoretically be carried over to redevelopment. The [[Kyoto Protocol]]'s 12th Article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/clean_development_mechanism/items/2718.php |title=Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)  |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  speaks to "flexible mechanisms". These mechanisms allow countries which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol to lower their overall emissions through the most economical means, respective, of course, to that country. Theoretically, these mechanisms could be directed towards post-traumatic redevelopment.

==UN==
The United Nations Division for Sustainable Development "provides [[leadership]] and is an authoritative source of expertise within the United Nations system on sustainable development".&lt;ref name="DFD"/&gt; The Division for Sustainable Development has been essential in the creation of such policies as [[Agenda 21]], and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.&lt;ref name="DFD"/&gt;

The [[United Nations]] declares that "Sustainable reconstruction management provides numerous environmental, safety and financial benefits."&lt;ref name="DFD"/&gt;

==World Bank==
The [[World Bank]] has been working on sustainable development projects through one of their internal groups, the Sustainable Development Network. These two groups work together to provide key sectors for sustainable development: "[[agriculture]] and [[rural development]], [[energy]], [[transport]], [[water]], [[Natural environment|environment]], [[urban development]], [[social development]], [[oil]], [[gas]], [[mining]], and [[chemical]]s, [[Information technology|information]] and [[Communication technology|communication]] technologies, and sub-national activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSDNET /0,,contentMDK:22113416~menuPK:64885073~pagePK:64885161~piPK:64884432~theSitePK:5929282,00.html |title=Sustainable Development - About Sustainable Development |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Natural Hazards Institute==
The Natural Hazards Research and Application Information Center of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] produced a work catalyzing the process for post-disaster sustainable redevelopment. In their book, “Holistic Disaster Recovery”, is spelled out the “Six Principles of [[Sustainability]]”

==The Six Principles of Sustainability==
1. Maintain and, if possible, enhance, its residents [[quality of life]].
2. Enhance local economic vitality.
3. Ensure social and intergenerational equity.
4. Maintain and, if possible, enhance, environmental quality.
5. Incorporate disaster resilience and [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]].
6. Use a consensus-building, participatory process when making
decisions &lt;ref&gt;Natural Hazards Research and Applications Information Center. ''Holistic Disaster Recovery, Ideas for Building Local Sustainability After a Natural Disaster''. University of Colorado, 2001. Web. 19 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the 122 points corresponds to a sample taken from a cancer [[tumor]] of four diagnostic classes (represented by color). For each sample, the expression level of 100 genes was recorded (represented by the axes). The animation shows that TPP is able to separate two of the classes clearly (red and purple), but two others could not be distinguished (blue and green). The position of the axes then indicates the activation of which genes are most associated with each class.]]

'''Targeted projection pursuit''' is a type of statistical technique used for [[exploratory data analysis]], [[information visualization]], and [[feature selection]]. It allows the user to interactively explore very complex data (typically having tens to hundreds of attributes) to find features or patterns of potential interest.

Conventional, or 'blind', [[projection pursuit]], finds the most "interesting" possible projections in multidimensional data, using a [[search algorithm]] that optimizes some fixed criterion of "interestingness" – such as deviation from a [[normal distribution]]. In contrast, targeted projection pursuit allows the user to explore the space of projections by manipulating data points directly in an interactive [[scatter plot]].

Targeted projection pursuit has found applications in [[DNA microarray]] data analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faith|first=Joseph |author2=Robert Mintram |author3=Maia Angelova|title=Targeted Projection Pursuit for Visualising Gene Expression Data Classifications|journal=Bioinformatics|year=2006|volume=22|issue=21|pages=2667–267|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btl463|url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/21/2667.full.pdf?keytype=ref&amp;ijkey=wTnlzDOhmjsF0j3|pmid=16954139}}&lt;/ref&gt; protein [[sequence analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haddow|first=Chris|author2=Marcus Durrant |author3=Justin Perry |author4=Joe Faith |title=Predicting Functional Residues of Protein Sequence Alignments as a Feature Selection Task|journal=International Journal of Data Mining in Bioinformatics|year=in press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[graph layout]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Helen|author2=Joe Faith |title=Node-Attribute Graph Layout for Small-World Networks|journal=Proceedings of 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation|year=2011|url=https://independent.academia.edu/JoeFaith/Papers/776056/Node-Attribute_Graph_Layout_for_Small-World_Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[digital signal processing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sujan|first=Rajbhandari|author2=Joe Faith |title=The Use of Linear Projections in the Visual Analysis of Signals in an Indoor Optical Wireless Link|journal=IEEE, IET International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing|year=2010|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5580367}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available as a package for the [[WEKA]] [[machine learning]] toolkit.

The '''Tenerife goldcrest''', ''Regulus regulus teneriffae'', (sometimes considered a separate species, ''R. teneriffae'') is a very small [[passerine]] bird in the [[kinglet]] family, closely resembling the [[goldcrest]] but with a broader black band across the forehead, slightly darker underparts and a longer bill. It breeds in the [[Canary Islands]] of [[Tenerife]] and [[La Gomera]], where it is a non-migratory resident. It prefers [[Canary Island Pine]] forests, but also occurs in [[laurisilva]] forests.

The populations on [[La Palma]] and [[El Hierro]], previously thought to belong to this taxon, are now recognized as, at least, a distinct subspecies, the [[Western Canary Islands goldcrest]] ''R. (r.) ellenthalerae'' (Päckert ''et al.'', 2006), which evolved from an independent colonisation of the islands.

In philosophy, '''the Real''' is that which is the authentic, unchangeable truth. It may be considered a primordial, external dimension of experience, referred to as the [[Infinity|infinite]], [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] or [[noumenal]], as opposed to a reality contingent on [[sense perception]] and the material order. The Real is often considered irreducible to the [[symbolic order]] of lived experience, but may be gestured to in certain cases, such as the experience of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].

==In psychoanalysis==
===Lacan===
For [[Jacques Lacan]], the order of the real is not only opposed to the [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary]] but is also located beyond the [[The Symbolic|symbolic]]. Unlike the symbolic, which is constituted in terms of oppositions such as "presence" and "absence", there is no absence in the real. The symbolic opposition between "presence" and "absence" implies the possibility that something may be missing from the symbolic, the real is "always in its place: it carries it glued to its heel, ignorant of what might exile it from there." If the symbolic is a set of differentiated signifiers, the real is in itself undifferentiated: "it is without fissure." The symbolic introduces "a cut in the real," in the process of signification: "it is the world of words that creates the world of things." Thus the real emerges as that which is outside language: "it is that which resists symbolization absolutely." The real is impossible because it is impossible to imagine, impossible to integrate into the symbolic order. This character of impossibility and resistance to symbolization lends the real its traumatic quality.

The primordial Real in which a (pre-[[Oedipal]]) human subject is born is differentiated from the real which a subject integrated into the [[symbolic order]] experiences. In the former, the real is the continuous, “whole” reality without categories and the differential function of language. Following the [[mirror stage]], however, and the eventual entrance of the imaginary and the symbolic (the split of the subject between the conscious imaginary and the unconscious symbolic), the real may only be experienced as traumatic gaps in the symbolic order. An example of this are traumatic events such as natural disasters, which effectively break down the signification of everyday life and cause a rupture of something alien and unrecognizable, without the usual grammar of the symbolic that conditions how to make meaning of something and how to proceed.

One of the main methods of psychoanalysis is to drain the traumatic experiences of the real into the symbolic through free association. The analyst searches the analysand’s discourse for sounds, words, or images of fixation and through dialectization attempt to bring these fixations to the regular [[metonymy|metonymic]] flow of the (unconscious) symbolic order, thereby integrating the subject further into their fantasy, usually referred to as “traversing the fantasy.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Fink (psychoanalyst)|Bruce Fink]], ''The Lacanian Subject: Between Language and Jouissance'', Princeton University Press, 1997, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Žižek ===
Contemporary Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]] has expanded on Lacan's theories and described (at least) three modalities of the Real:&lt;ref name=Daly2004&gt;{{cite web|last=Daly|first=Glyn|title=Slavoj Zizek: A Primer|url=http://www.lacan.com/zizek-primer.htm|publisher=lacan dot com|accessdate=17 August 2012|year=2004|quote=The real Real is the hard limit that functions as the horrifying Thing (the Alien, Medusa's head, maelstrom and so on) - a shattering force of negation. The symbolic Real refers to the anonymous symbols and codes (scientific formulae, digitalisation, empty signifiers...) that function in an indifferent manner as the abstract "texture" onto which, or out of which, reality is constituted. In The Matrix, for example, the symbolic Real is given expression at the point where Neo perceives "reality" in terms of the abstract streams of digital output. In the contemporary world, Zizek argues that it is capital itself that provides this essential backdrop to our reality and as such represents the symbolic Real of our age (Zizek, 1999: 222; 276). With the ''imaginary real'' we have precisely the (unsustainable) dimension of fantasmatic excess-negation that is explored in Flatliners. This is why cyberspace is such an ambiguous imaginary realm.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "real Real": a horrific thing, that which conveys the sense of [[Horror (emotion)|horror]] in horror films
* The "symbolic real": the signifier reduced to a meaningless formula like [[quantum physics]], which cannot be understood in any meaningful way, only grasped through abstract mathematics.
* The "imaginary real": an unfathomable something that permeates things as a trace of the sublime. This form of the real becomes perceptible in the film ''[[The Full Monty]]'', in the fact of disrobing the unemployed protagonists completely; in other words, through this extra gesture of "voluntary" degradation, something else, of the order of the sublime, becomes visible. Žižek also used the film ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' as an example, where the "invaded" Austrians are depicted more like provincial fascists (blond, beautiful, historic dresses), while the Nazis are managers, bureaucrats, etc., "like cosmopolitan decadent corrupted Jews." He posits that the movie has a hidden pro-fascist message that is not directly seen but embedded in the texture.

==In philosophy&lt;!--linked from 'Rudolf Christoph Eucken'--&gt;==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Reality, says [[Rudolf Christoph Eucken]], is an independent spiritual world, unconditioned by the apparent world of sense. To know it and to live in it is man's true destiny. His point of contact with it is personality: the inward fount of his being: his heart, not his head. Man is real, and in the deepest sense alive, in virtue of this free personal life-principle within him; but he is bound and blinded by the ties set up between his surface-intelligence and the sense-world. The struggle for reality must be a struggle on man's part to transcend the sense-world, escape its bondage. He must renounce it, and be 're-born' to a higher level of consciousness; shifting his centre of interest from the natural to the spiritual plane. According to the thoroughness with which he does this, will be the amount of real life he enjoys. The initial break with the 'world,' the refusal to spend one’s life communing with one’s own cinematograph picture, is essential if the freedom of the infinite is to be attained. We are amphibious creatures: our life moves upon two levels at once—the natural and the spiritual. The key to the puzzle of man lies in the fact that he is "the meeting point of various stages of Reality." All his difficulties and triumphs are grounded in this. The whole question for him is, which world shall be central for him—the Real, vital, all-embracing life we call spirit, or the lower life of sense? Shall 'Existence,' the superficial obvious thing, or 'Substance,' the underlying verity, be his home? Shall he remain the slave of the senses with their habits and customs, or rise to a plane of consciousness, of heroic endeavour, in which—participating in the life of spirit—he knows reality because he is real?" ([[Evelyn Underhill]] (1911), ''Mysticism'', [https://archive.org/stream/mysticismstudyin00undeuoft#page/40/mode/2up p. 40])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are," says [[Plotinus]], "different roads by which this end [apprehension of the Infinite] may be reached. The love of beauty, which exalts the poet; that devotion to the One and that ascent of science which makes the ambition of the philosopher; and that love and those prayers by which some devout and ardent soul tends in its moral purity towards perfection. These are the great highways conducting to that height above the actual and the particular, where we stand in the immediate presence of the Infinite, who shines out as from the deeps of the soul." (Plotinus, Letter to Flaccus)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In aesthetics==

Édouard Récéjac states: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the mind penetrates deeply into the facts of aesthetics, it will find more and more, that these facts are based upon an ideal identity between the mind itself and things. At a certain point the harmony becomes so complete, and the finality so close that it gives us actual emotion. The Beautiful then becomes the sublime; brief apparition, by which the soul is caught up into the true mystic state, and touches the Absolute, the Real. It is scarcely possible to persist in this Esthetic perception without feeling lifted up by it above things and above ourselves, in an ontological vision which closely resembles the Absolute of the Mystics. (Édouard Récéjac, ''Fondements de la Connaissance Mystique'' (1897), p. 74)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <comment>Removing the stated specification that a thermodynamic operation requires a contribution from an ANIMATE source. Any external force unto a system is called a thermodynamic operation. This is conceded in the original sentence with the phrase "..., or at least ...".</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14210">A '''thermodynamic operation''' is an externally imposed manipulation or change of connection or wall between a [[thermodynamic system]] and its surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;[[László Tisza|Tisza, L.]] (1966), pp. 41, 109, 121, originally published as 'The thermodynamics of phase equilibrium', ''Annals of Physics'', '''13''': 1–92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giles 22"&gt;Giles, R. (1964), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="L&amp;Y 14"&gt;Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]](1960/1985), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; An externally imposed change in the state of the surroundings of a system can usually be regarded as a virtual thermodynamic operation. It may usually be analyzed as due to changes in the walls that separate the systems in the surroundings. It is assumed in thermodynamics that the operation is conducted in ignorance of any pertinent microscopic information.

A thermodynamic operation requires a contribution from an independent external agency, that does not come from the passive properties of the systems. Perhaps the first expression of the distinction between a thermodynamic operation and a thermodynamic process is in Kelvin's statement of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]: "It is impossible, by means of inanimate material agency, to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the temperature of the surrounding objects." A sequence of events that occurred other than "by means of inanimate material agency" would entail an action by an animate agency, or at least an independent external agency. Such an agency could impose some thermodynamic operations. For example, those operations might create a heat pump, which of course would comply with the second law. A [[Maxwell's demon]] conducts an extremely idealized and naturally unrealizable kind of thermodynamic operation.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), pp. 88, 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ordinary language expression for a thermodynamic operation is used by [[Edward A. Guggenheim]]: "tampering" with the bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward A. Guggenheim|Guggenheim, E.A.]] (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction between thermodynamic operation and thermodynamic process==

A typical thermodynamic operation is a removal of an initially separating wall, a manipulation that unites two systems into one undivided system. A typical thermodynamic process consists of a redistribution that spreads a conserved quantity between a system and its surroundings across a previously impermeable but newly unchanging semi-permeable wall between them.&lt;ref&gt;[[László Tisza|Tisza, L.]] (1966), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, a process can be considered as a transfer of some quantity that is defined by an extensive state variable of the system, so that a transfer balance equation can be written.&lt;ref&gt;Gyarmati, I. (1970), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Uffink, "... thermodynamic processes only take place after an external intervention on the system (such as: removing a partition, establishing thermal contact with a heat bath, pushing a piston, etc.). They do not correspond to the autonomous behaviour of a free system."&lt;ref&gt;Uffink, J. (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a matter of history, the distinction, between a thermodynamic operation and a thermodynamic process, is not found in these terms in nineteenth century accounts. For example, Kelvin spoke of a "thermodynamic operation" when he meant what present-day terminology calls a thermodynamic operation followed by a thermodynamic process.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin, Lord]] (1857).&lt;/ref&gt; Again, Planck usually spoke of a "process" when our present-day terminology would speak of a thermodynamic operation followed by a thermodynamic process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]] (1887).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]] (1897/1903), p.&amp;nbsp;104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planck's "natural processes" contrasted with actions of Maxwell's demon===

Planck held that all "natural processes" (meaning, in present-day terminology, a thermodynamic operation followed by a thermodynamic process) are irreversible and proceed in the sense of increase of entropy sum.&lt;ref&gt;Guggenheim, A.E. (1949/1967), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In these terms, it would be by thermodynamic operations that, if he could exist, Maxwell's demon would conduct unnatural affairs, which include transitions in the sense away from thermodynamic equilibrium. They are physically theoretically conceivable up to a point, but are not natural processes in Planck's sense. The reason is that ordinary thermodynamic operations are conducted in total ignorance of the very kinds of microscopic information that is essential to the efforts of Maxwell's demon.

==Examples of thermodynamic operations==
===Thermodynamic cycle===

A [[thermodynamic cycle]] is constructed as a sequence of stages or steps. Each stage consists of a thermodynamic operation followed by a thermodynamic process. For example, an initial thermodynamic operation of a cycle of a [[Carnot heat engine]] could be taken as the setting of the working body, at a known high temperature, into contact with a thermal reservoir at the same temperature (the hot reservoir), through a wall permeable only to heat, while it remains in mechanical contact with the work reservoir. This thermodynamic operation is followed by a thermodynamic process, in which the expansion of the working body is so slow as to be effectively reversible, while internal energy is transferred as heat from the hot reservoir to the working body and as work from the working body to the work reservoir. Theoretically, the process terminates eventually, and this ends the stage. The engine is then subject to another thermodynamic operation, and the cycle proceeds into another stage. The cycle completes when the thermodynamic variables (the thermodynamic state) of the working body return to their initial values.

===Virtual thermodynamic operations===

A [[refrigerator|refrigeration device]] passes a working substance through successive stages, overall constituting a cycle. This may be brought about not by moving or changing separating walls around an unmoving body of working substance, but rather by moving a body of working substance to bring about exposure to a cyclic succession of unmoving unchanging walls. The effect is virtually a cycle of thermodynamic operations. The kinetic energy of bulk  motion of the working substance is not a significant feature of the device, and the working substance may be practically considered as nearly at rest.

===Composition of systems===

For many chains of reasoning in thermodynamics, it is convenient to think of the combination of two systems into one. It is imagined that the two systems, separated from their surroundings, are juxtaposed and (by a shift of viewpoint) regarded as constituting a new, composite system. The composite system is imagined amid its new overall surroundings. This sets up the possibility of interaction between the two subsystems and between the composite system and its overall surroundings, for example by allowing contact through a wall with a particular kind of permeability. This conceptual device was introduced into thermodynamics mainly in the work of Carathéodory, and has been widely used since then.&lt;ref name="Giles 22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L&amp;Y 14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[László Tisza|Tisza, L.]] (1966), pp. 41, 50, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carathéodory 1909"&gt;[[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory, C.]] (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]] (1935).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1960/1985), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additivity of extensive variables===

If the thermodynamic operation is entire removal of walls, then extensive state variables of the composed system are the respective sums of those of the component systems. This is called the '''additivity''' of extensive variables.

===Scaling of a system===

A thermodynamic system consisting of a single phase, in the absence of external forces, in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, is homogeneous.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]] (1897/1903), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the material in any region of the system can be interchanged with the material of any congruent and parallel region of the system, and the effect is to leave the system thermodynamically unchanged. The thermodynamic operation of ''scaling'' is the creation of a new homogeneous system whose size is a multiple of the old size, and whose [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive variables]] have the same values. Traditionally the size is stated by the mass of the system, but sometimes it is stated by the entropy, or by the volume.&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, P.T. (1961), pp. 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[László Tisza|Tisza, L.]], (1966), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haase, R. (1971), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1960/1985), pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; For a given such system {{math|Φ}}, scaled by the real number {{math|''λ''}} to yield a new one {{math|''λ''Φ}}, a [[state function]], {{math|''X''(.)}}, such that {{math|''X''(''λ''Φ) {{=}} ''λ X''(Φ)}}, is said to be [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]]. Such a function as {{math|''X''}} is called a [[homogeneous function]] of degree 1. There are two different concepts mentioned here, sharing the same name:  (a) the mathematical concept of degree-1 homogeneity in the scaling function; and (b)  the physical concept of the spatial homogeneity of the system. It happens that the two agree here, but that is not because they are tautologous. It is a contingent fact of thermodynamics.

===Splitting and recomposition of systems===

If two systems, {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;b''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, have identical intensive variables, a thermodynamic operation of wall removal can compose them into a single system, {{math|''S''}}, with the same intensive variables. If, for example, their internal energies are in the ratio {{math|''λ'':(1−''λ'')}}, then the composed system, {{math|''S''}}, has internal energy in the ratio of {{math|1:''λ''}} to that of the system {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. By the inverse thermodynamic operation, the system {{math|''S''}} can be split into two subsystems in the obvious way. As usual, these thermodynamic operations are conducted in total ignorance of the microscopic states of the systems. More particularly, it is characteristic of macroscopic thermodynamics that the probability vanishes, that the splitting operation occurs at an instant when system {{math|''S''}} is in the kind of extreme transient microscopic state envisaged by the [[Poincaré recurrence theorem|Poincaré recurrence]] argument. Such splitting and recomposition is in accord with the above defined additivity of extensive variables.

==Statements of laws==

Thermodynamic operations appear in the statements of the laws of thermodynamics. For the zeroth law, one considers operations of thermally connecting and disconnecting systems. For the second law, some statements contemplate an operation of connecting two initially unconnected systems. For the third law, one statement is that no finite sequence of thermodynamic operations can bring a system to absolute zero temperature.

'''Violence against prostitutes''' has been reported worldwide, both on a physical and psychological level. The victims are predominantly women, including in extreme cases murder both inside and outside the workplace.

== Prevalence ==
Women working in prostitution experience more levels of violence against them than women working in other fields.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Rodríguez Martínez, Pilar. "An Intersectional Analysis of Intimate Partner Violence and Workplace Violence among Women Working in Prostitution."''Revista Española De Investigaciones Sociologicas'' no. 151 (July 2015): 123-138. ''SocINDEX with Full Text'', EBSCO''host'' (accessed November 2, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the [[homicide]] rate for female sex workers  in the United States was estimated to be 204 per 100,000, although this figure mixes illegal work with legal work.{{sfn|Potterat|Brewer|Muth|Rothenberg|2004}} This figure is considerably higher than that for the next riskiest occupations in the United States during a similar period (4 per 100,000 for female liquor store workers and 29 per 100,000 for male taxicab drivers).{{sfn|Castillo|Jenkins|1994}}  The prevalence of violence against prostitutes varies by location.  A study of female prostitutes in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada over the age of 14 who used illicit drugs other than marijuana found that 57% of prostitutes experienced some form of gender-based violence over an 18-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prevalence and structural correlates of gender based violence among a prospective cohort of female sex workers|url = http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b2939|journal = BMJ|date = 2009-08-11|issn = 0959-8138|pmc = 2725271|pmid = 19671935|pages = b2939|volume = 339|doi = 10.1136/bmj.b2939|first = Kate|last = Shannon|first2 = T.|last2 = Kerr|first3 = S.

== Types of violence ==

=== Physical ===
[[Violence|Physical violence]] is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as "the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = WHO {{!}} World report on violence and health|url = http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/|website = www.who.int|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Physical violence is more commonly experienced by outdoor sex-workers with 47% of prostitutes working outdoors reporting being kicked, punched, or slapped in one study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In a study of prostitutes working in San Francisco, 82% of participants reported having experienced some type of physical violence since entering prostitution, with 55% of these assaults being committed by a client.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prostitution, Violence, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1300/J013v27n03_03|journal = Women &amp; Health|pages = 37–49|volume = 27|issue = 3|doi = 10.1300/j013v27n03_03|first = Melissa|last = Farley|first2 = Howard|last2 = Barkan|pmid=9698636|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different study found a slightly rate lower with 74% of sex-workers reported experiencing some form of physical abuse in their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = History of Abuse and Psychological Distress Symptoms among Female Sex Workers in Two Mexico-U.S. Border Cities|journal = Violence and victims|date = 2009-01-01|issn = 0886-6708|pmc = 2777761|pmid = 19634364|pages = 399–413|volume = 24|issue = 3|first = Monica|last = Ulibarri|first2 = Shirley J.|last2 = Semple|first3 = Swati|last3 = Rao|first4 = Steffanie A.|last4 = Strathdee|first5 = Miguel A.|last5 = Fraga-Vallejo|first6 = Jesus|last6 = Bucardo|first7 = Adela|last7 = De la Torre|first8 = Juan|last8 = Salazar-Reyna|first9 = Prisci|last9 = Orozovich|doi=10.1891/0886-6708.24.3.399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless, the general consensus among most studies regarding violence against prostitutes is that rates of physical violence against prostitutes is extremely high, particularly among female sex workers (transgender inclusive) who experience higher rates of physical violence than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Psychological ===
[[Psychological abuse]], also referred to as mental abuse or emotional abuse is  characterized by a person subjecting or exposing another to behavior that may result in psychological trauma, including [[anxiety]], [[chronic depression]], or [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dutton | first1 = D.

E.|last = Thompson|first2 = C. A.|last2 = Kaplan|doi=10.1192/bjp.168.2.143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United Nations Population Fund]] says that this type of violence "includes, but is not limited to, being insulted (e.g. called derogatory names) or made to feel bad about oneself; being humiliated or belittled in front of other people; being threatened with loss of custody of one's children; being confined or [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolated]] from family or friends; being threatened with harm to oneself or someone one cares about; repeated shouting, inducing fear through [[intimidating]] words or gestures; [[controlling behavior]]; and the destruction of possessions."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There are certain types of psychological or emotional abuse that sex workers are more prone to such as denial of basic needs, forced drug or alcohol consumption, and being arrested for carrying condoms to name a few.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Women working in prostitution are especially vulnerable to psychological abuse, particularly [[verbal abuse]], because many customers and other members of society view them as "whores" or as generally undesirable women. Often verbal abuse will occur either while the service is being given, or after it has been given and the customer is not satisfied. In both these cases, verbal abuse can be a precursor to sexual violence from the client.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In one study, 78% of sex-workers reported having experienced emotional or psychological abuse in their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Sexual ===
[[Sexual violence]] is any sexual act or attempt to obtain a sexual act by violence or coercion, unwanted sexual comments or advances, acts to traffic a person or acts directed against a person's sexuality, regardless of the relationship to the victim.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization., World report on violence and health (Geneva: World Health Organization, 2002), Chapter 6, pp. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elements of Crimes, Article 7(1)(g)-6 Crimes against humanity of sexual violence, elements 1.

(1998). ''Contemporary forms of slavery: systematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices during armed conflict''.  Final report submitted by Ms. Jay J. McDougall, Special Rapporteur,&lt;/ref&gt;  The risks of sexual abuse are overall lower than the risks of physical abuse. with the exception of indoor prostitutes who report a higher rate of rape or attempted rape than any one type of physical violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In one study, 44% of sex-workers reported having experienced sexual abuse in their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Rates of sexual assault and rape are higher among women (including transgender women) than among men, though the overall rate is high with one study finding that 68% of respondents had been raped since entering prostitution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  These high levels of sexual violence suffered by sex workers have very traumatic effects on the men and women working as prostitutes. High levels of rape other forms of sexual violence while working as a prostitute have been linked to higher levels of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Contributing factors ==
Studies have shown that younger sex-workers tend to experience more client violence than their older colleagues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Furthermore, cisgender and transgender female sex workers are also more likely to experience violence committed by a client than their male sex worker counterparts.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Legal vs illegal sex work ===
Laws prohibiting prostitution can make it difficult for the men and women engaging in prostitution to report any violence they may experience while on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=hwlj|title = For Their Own Good: The Results of the Prostitution Laws as Enforced by Cops, Politician and Judges|last = Almodovar|first = Norma Jean|date = January 1, 1999|journal = Hastings Women's Law Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often transactions or arrangements to meet up with clients must be made in secret in places where prostitution is illegal.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Barnard, Marina A.

== Perpetrators ==

===Violent clients, pimps and police officers===
Perpetrators may include violent clients and [[pimps]]. Clients oftentimes attempt to maintain a power balance that favors them over the prostitutes.  This is often done through different methods of violence such as sexual, emotional, and physical.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Though pimps may be perpetrators of violence against sex workers with 53% of sex workers in one study reporting that violence at the hands of pimps is a major problem, 33% of subjects interviewed in that same study reported that the main benefit to having a pimp is the protection from potential assault.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=ca066bbe-c370-4f90-a033-f2ed967c0e92%2540sessionmgr112&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=120|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the illegality of sex work in many parts of the world, sex workers often have to service clients in discreet and isolated spaces where they are less likely to get caught by the police. Because of this isolation, sex workers are made more vulnerable to attacks by their clients. According to a study conducted on one hundred and thirty people working in [[San Francisco]] as street sex workers, 82% had been physically assaulted, 83% had been threatened with a weapon and 68% had been raped while working as prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/prostitution_research/000021.html |title=Prostitution Research &amp; Education Website |publisher=Prostitutionresearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918115439/http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/prostitution_research/000021.html |archive-date=2012-09-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries such as the United States sex work is illegal, and so sex workers are not able to report violence done against them in fear of being arrested themselves. In certain states anti-prostitution mandates carry a minimum sentence and can increase to felony charge after multiple arrests, which leads to difficulty finding housing and employment, and disqualification for welfare benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Melissa Gira. "The War on Sex Workers." ''Reason.com''. N.p., 21 Jan. 2013. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally sex workers may be registered as sex offenders, or face deportation if they have precarious migratory or citizenship status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wahab | first1 = Stéphanie | last2 = Panichelli | first2 = Meg | year = 2013 | title = Ethical and Human Rights Issues in Coercive Interventions With Sex Workers | url = | journal = Journal of Women and Social Work | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 344–49 | doi=10.1177/0886109913505043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the stigma that exists around sex work, police are less likely to investigate attacks on sex workers.{{sfn|Wong|Holroyd|Bingham|2011}}  As one sex worker in South Africa reports "to gather evidence of a crime against a sex worker, they have to first take it seriously,”. “If we go to the police to report abuse, we’re made fun of, we’re told ‘you deserve it.’ They chase you away,” notes another sex worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rewire.news/article/2011/12/15/ending-police-abuse-sex-workers/|title=Police Abuse of Sex Workers: A Global Reality, Widely Ignored|last=Mgbako|first=Chi|date=December 15, 2011|website=Rewire|publisher=|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police officers themselves are common perpetrators of violence against prostitutes. A study of sex-workers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia found that half of the women had been beaten by police and about a third had been gang-raped by police.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; "In South Africa, where sex work has been illegal since the former apartheid regime criminalized it in 1957, police officers often fine sex workers inordinate sums of money and pocket the cash, resulting in a pattern of economic extortion of sex workers by state agents."&lt;ref&gt;Mgbako, Chi. "Police Abuse of Sex Workers: A Global Reality, Widely Ignored." ''Rewire''. Rewire, 15 Dec. 2011. Web. 04 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serial killers===
[[File:Jack the ripper.jpg|thumb|Jack the Ripper attacks a woman]]
Sex workers (particularly those engaging in [[street prostitution]]) are also sometimes targeted by [[serial killer]]s, who may consider them easy targets and less likely to be missed, or who use the religious and social stigma associated with sex workers as justification for their murder.

The unidentified serial killer known as [[Jack the Ripper]] killed at least five sex workers in [[London]] in 1888. Due to the frequent murders of prostitutes at that time and place, however, it is difficult to be certain of the number killed by Jack the Ripper. These particular murders are distinguished from other murders of sex workers during the same time period due to the post-mortem mutilations that occurred, and it is for that reason that other murders of prostitutes are not usually attributed to the Ripper, or are disputed.

[[Peter Sutcliffe]] (aka the Yorkshire Ripper) murdered 13 women, some of whom were sex workers, from 1975-1980 in [[Northern England]].

[[Gary Ridgway]] (aka the Green River Killer), confessed to killing 48 sex workers from 1982 to 1998, making him one of the most prolific serial killers in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/11/05/green.river.killings/index.html |title=Green River Killer avoids death in plea deal - November 6, 2003 |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Hansen]] murdered between 15 and 21 sex workers, near [[Anchorage, Alaska]], between 1980 and 1983.

[[Joel Rifkin]] confessed to killing 17 sex workers in the New York area between 1989 and 1993, without there having been a missing persons report filed on any of the women during that time.

[[Robert Pickton]], a Canadian who lived near [[Vancouver]], made headlines after the remains of numerous missing sex workers were found on his family farm. He has now been convicted of the murders of 6 women who went missing from Vancouver's [[Downtown Eastside]], and is suspected by police of killing at least twenty more (though no charges have been filed in relation to their deaths).  In December 2007 he was sentenced to life in prison, with no possibility of parole for 25 years.

In December 2006, [[Steve Wright (serial killer)|Steve Wright]] murdered five sex workers in [[Ipswich]], [[England]] (see [[Ipswich serial murders]]).

== Efforts to combat ==
Most efforts to advocate for prostitutes have focused on prevention of the spread of AIDS/HIV+ among the general population rather than focusing on how certain policies would benefit the prostitutes themselves.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  This focus has neglected many of the issues of violence facing sex workers.  Recently, however, there has been an effort to eradicate violence against prostitutes from a wider perspective.  The United Nations Population Fund, in conjunction with several other organizations, recommends community empowerment, led by sex workers, as a way to combat violence against sex-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Implementing comprehensive HIV/STI programmes with sex workers: Practical approaches from collaborative interventions|url = http://www.unfpa.org/publications/implementing-comprehensive-hivsti-programmes-sex-workers-practical-approaches|website = UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   UNPF also advocates for changing perceptions to view sex work as work, rather than an illegal activity.  One issue facing efforts to prevent violence against prostitutes is that there is a low level of reporting violence among prostitutes.  A study of female sex-workers in India found that 54% of female sex-workers do not report violence committed against them, and only 36% shared their experience with NGOs or a peer or family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Non-Disclosure of Violence among Female Sex Workers: Evidence from a Large Scale Cross-Sectional Survey in India|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098321|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2014-05-20|pmc = 4028275|pmid = 24846145|pages = e98321|volume = 9|issue = 5|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0098321|first = Bidhubhusan|last = Mahapatra|first2 = Madhusudana|last2 = Battala|first3 = Akash|last3 = Porwal|first4 = Niranjan|last4 = Saggurti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By sex workers ===
Because of the increased risk of violence associated with working in sex work, many sex workers have begun adopting their own personal policies to reduce the likelihood of becoming the victims of violence.  A study by Maureen A. Norton-Hawk found that "40% percent of sex workers have a policy of refusing to provide services in an alley, 54% refuse to provide services in a drug house, and 68% refuse to provide services in an abandoned building."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Often sex workers must rely on themselves or each other for support in ending violence as many campaigns to end violence against women ignore the needs of sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = Michelle S | year = 1999 | title = Prostitutes, Drug Users, and Thieves: The Invisible Women in the Campaign to End Violence Against Women | url = | journal = Temple Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 459–475 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government policy ===
[[File:Sex Worker Rights - London SlutWalk 2011.jpg|thumb|Sex Workers' Rights demonstration at London SlutWalk 2011]]
[[UN Women]] supports the decriminalization of sex work in order to protect sex-workers from violence and abuse and encourages the criminalization of forms of violence, coercion and exploitation in sex work.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;UN Women. "Notes on Sex Work, Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking." NSWP (2013).  Accessed September 23, 2015. http://www.nswp.org/resource/un-womens-note-sex-work-sexual-exploitation-and-trafficking&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, however, the United States of America requires that all countries it gives aid to for AIDS/HIV+ prevention and relief agree to an "[[anti-prostitution pledge]]" that dictates that the country receiving aid must adopt policy that treats sex work and prostitution the same as sex trafficking.  This policy has resulted in inadequate attention being paid to the health needs of prostitutes and limits the ability of the government to address the specific needs that sex workers have.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Lerum, Kari."Reducing Violence against Sex Workers: What are the policy options?." Human Rights for All (2011). Accessed September 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, in the United States, many states have mandatory minimum sentencing laws that require judges to give anyone convicted of prostitution a mandatory minimum prison sentence.  This can, in turn, make it less likely that prostitutes take legal action against the perpetrators of violence against them because doing so could be risking jail time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  One possible policy option that the Netherlands has done would be to designate specific places for sex workers and clients to meet up and arrange and engage in sexual activities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  This would provide a safe and secure place for sexual services to be sold without having to remain in private which can be a risk factor for violence against prostitutes.  Some organizations have even suggested forming support groups composed of sex workers in the area as a way to give sex workers the support they often lack.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The '''X chromosome''' is one of the two [[sex determination system|sex-determining]] [[chromosome]]s ([[allosome]]s) in many organisms, including mammals (the other is the [[Y chromosome]]), and is found in both males and females. It is a part of the [[XY sex-determination system]] and [[X0 sex-determination system]]. The X chromosome was named for its unique properties by early researchers, which resulted in the naming of its counterpart Y chromosome, for the next letter in the alphabet, following its subsequent discovery.&lt;ref name="nyt-angier"&gt;{{cite web

==Discovery==

It was first noted that the X chromosome was special in 1890 by [[Hermann Henking]] in Leipzig. Henking was studying the testicles of [[Pyrrhocoris apterus|''Pyrrhocoris'']] and noticed that one chromosome did not take part in [[meiosis]]. Chromosomes are so named because of their ability to take up [[staining]] (''chroma'' in Greek means ''color''). Although the X chromosome could be stained just as well as the others, Henking was unsure whether it was a different class of object and consequently named it ''X element'',&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt; which later became X chromosome after it was established that it was indeed a chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;David Bainbridge, 'The X in Sex: How the X Chromosome Controls Our Lives'', pages 3-5, Harvard University Press, 2003 {{ISBN|0674016211}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that the X chromosome was named after its similarity to the letter "X" is mistaken. All chromosomes normally appear as an amorphous blob under the microscope and only take on a well defined shape during mitosis. This shape is vaguely X-shaped for all chromosomes. It is entirely coincidental that the Y chromosome, during [[mitosis]], has two very short branches which can look merged under the microscope and appear as the descender of a Y-shape.&lt;ref&gt;Bainbridge, pages 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first suggested that the X chromosome was involved in sex determination by [[Clarence Erwin McClung]] in 1901. After comparing his work on [[locust]]s with Henking's and others, McClung noted that only half the sperm received an X chromosome. He called this chromosome an ''accessory chromosome'', and insisted (correctly) that it was a ''proper'' chromosome, and theorized (incorrectly)  that it was the male-determining chromosome.&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;James Schwartz, ''In Pursuit of the Gene: From Darwin to DNA'', pages 155-158, Harvard University Press, 2009 {{ISBN|0674034910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inheritance pattern==
[[File:X chromosome ancestral line Fibonacci sequence.svg|thumb|360px|The number of possible ancestors on the X chromosome inheritance line at a given ancestral generation follows the Fibonacci sequence. (After Hutchison, L. "Growing the Family Tree: The Power of DNA in Reconstructing Family Relationships".&lt;ref name="xcs"/&gt;)]]
[[Luke Hutchison]] noticed that a number of possible ancestors on the X chromosome inheritance line at a given ancestral generation follows the [[Fibonacci sequence]].&lt;ref name="xcs"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutchison|first=Luke|date=September 2004|title=Growing the Family Tree: The Power of DNA in Reconstructing Family Relationships|url=http://fhtw.byu.edu/static/conf/2005/hutchison-growing-fhtw2005.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the First Symposium on Bioinformatics and Biotechnology (BIOT-04)|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-09-03|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A male individual has an X chromosome, which he received from his mother, and a [[Y chromosome]], which he received from his father. The male counts as the "origin" of his own X chromosome (&lt;math&gt;F_1=1&lt;/math&gt;), and at his parents' generation, his X chromosome came from a single parent (&lt;math&gt;F_2=1&lt;/math&gt;). The male's mother received one X chromosome from her mother (the son's maternal grandmother), and one from her father (the son's maternal grandfather), so two grandparents contributed to the male descendant's X chromosome (&lt;math&gt;F_3=2&lt;/math&gt;). The maternal grandfather received his X chromosome from his mother, and the maternal grandmother received X chromosomes from both of her parents, so three great-grandparents contributed to the male descendant's X chromosome (&lt;math&gt;F_4=3&lt;/math&gt;). Five great-great-grandparents contributed to the male descendant's X chromosome (&lt;math&gt;F_5=5&lt;/math&gt;), etc. (Note that this assumes that all ancestors of a given descendant are independent, but if any genealogy is traced far enough back in time, ancestors begin to appear on multiple lines of the genealogy, until eventually, a [[Founder effect|population founder]] appears on all lines of the genealogy.)

==Humans==

===Function===
[[Image:Sd4hi-unten-crop.jpg|thumb|Nucleus of a female amniotic fluid cell. Top: Both X-chromosome territories are detected by [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|FISH]]. Shown is a single optical section made with a [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy|confocal microscope]]. Bottom: Same nucleus stained with [[DAPI]] and recorded with a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD camera]]. The Barr body is indicated by the arrow, it identifies the inactive X (Xi).
]]
The X chromosome in humans spans more than 153 million [[base pairs]] (the building material of [[DNA]]). It represents about 800 protein-coding genes compared to the Y chromosome containing about 70 genes, out of 20,000–25,000 total genes in the human genome.
Each person usually has one pair of sex chromosomes in each cell. Females have two X chromosomes, whereas males have one X and one [[Y chromosome]]. Both males and females retain one of their mother's X chromosomes, and females retain their second X chromosome from their father. Since the father retains his X chromosome from his mother, a human female has one X chromosome from her paternal grandmother (father's side), and one X chromosome from her mother. This inheritance pattern [[#Inheritance pattern|follows the Fibonacci numbers]] at a given ancestral depth.

[[Genetic disorder]]s that are due to [[mutation]]s in genes on the X chromosome are described as '''X linked'''.

The X chromosome carries hundreds of genes but few, if any, of these have anything to do directly with sex determination. Early in [[embryo]]nic development in females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly and permanently inactivated in nearly all somatic cells (cells other than [[ovum|egg]] and [[spermatozoon|sperm]] cells). This phenomenon is called [[X-inactivation]] or [[Lyonization]], and creates a [[Barr body]]. If X-inactivation in the somatic cell meant a complete de-functionalizing of one of the X-chromosomes, it would ensure that females, like males, had only one functional copy of the X chromosome in each somatic cell. This was previously assumed to be the case. However, recent research suggests that the [[Barr body]] may be more biologically active than was previously supposed.&lt;ref name="Carrel"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carrel L, Willard H |title=X-inactivation profile reveals extensive variability in X-linked gene expression in females |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=434 |issue=7031 |pages=400–4 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/nature03479 |pmid=15772666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genes===
=== Number of genes ===
The following are some of the gene count estimates of human X chromosome. Because researchers use different approaches to [[genome annotation]] their predictions of the [[number of genes]] on each chromosome varies (for technical details, see [[gene prediction]]). Among various projects, the collaborative consensus coding sequence project ([[Consensus CDS Project|CCDS]]) takes an extremely conservative strategy. So CCDS's gene number prediction represents a lower bound on the total number of human protein-coding genes.&lt;ref name="pmid20441615"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Pertea M, Salzberg SL| title=Between a chicken and a grape: estimating the number of human genes | journal=Genome Biol | year= 2010 | volume= 11 | issue= 5 | pages= 206 | pmid=20441615 | doi=10.1186/gb-2010-11-5-206 | pmc=2898077 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=20441615  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===

It is theorized by Ross et al. 2005 and Ohno 1967 that the X chromosome is at least partially derived from the autosomal (non-sex-related) genome of other mammals, evidenced from interspecies genomic sequence alignments.

The X chromosome is notably larger and has a more active [[euchromatin]] region than its [[Y chromosome]] counterpart. Further comparison of the X and Y reveal regions of homology between the two. However, the corresponding region in the Y appears far shorter and lacks regions that are conserved in the X throughout primate species, implying a genetic degeneration for Y in that region. Because males have only one X chromosome, they are more likely to have an X chromosome-related disease.

It is estimated that about 10% of the genes encoded by the X chromosome are associated with a family of "CT" genes, so named because they encode for markers found in both tumor cells (in cancer patients) as well as in the human [[testis]] (in healthy patients).&lt;ref name="ross"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ross M, etal |title=The DNA sequence of the human X chromosome |journal=Nature |volume=434 |issue=7031 |pages=325–37 |year=2005 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v434/n7031/full/nature03440.html |doi=10.1038/nature03440 |pmid=15772651 |pmc=2665286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in diseases===
====Numerical abnormalities====
[[Klinefelter syndrome]]:
* Klinefelter syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. Extra genetic material from the X chromosome interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of [[testosterone]].
* Males with Klinefelter syndrome typically have one extra copy of the X chromosome in each cell, for a total of two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome (47,XXY). It is less common for affected males to have two or three extra X chromosomes (48,XXXY or 49,XXXXY) or extra copies of both the X and Y chromosomes (48,XXYY) in each cell. The extra genetic material may lead to tall stature, learning and reading disabilities, and other medical problems. Each extra X chromosome lowers the child's [[IQ]] by about 15 points,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/945649-overview#a0104|author1=Harold Chen |author2=Ian Krantz |author3=Mary L Windle |author4=Margaret M McGovern |author5=Paul D Petry |author6=Bruce Buehler |date=2013-02-22 | accessdate=2014-07-18 | title=Klinefelter Syndrome Pathophysiology |website=Medscape}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Visootsak J, Graham JM |title=Klinefelter syndrome and other sex chromosomal aneuploidies |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=1 |issue= |pages=42 |year=2006 |pmid=17062147 |pmc=1634840 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-1-42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that the average IQ in Klinefelter syndrome is in general in the normal range, although below average. When additional X and/or Y chromosomes are present in 48,XXXY, 48,XXYY, or 49,XXXXY, developmental delays and cognitive difficulties can be more severe and mild [[intellectual disability]] may be present.
* Klinefelter syndrome can also result from an extra X chromosome in only some of the body's cells. These cases are called mosaic 46,XY/47,XXY.

[[Triple X syndrome]] (also called 47,XXX or trisomy X):
* This syndrome results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have three X chromosomes, for a total of 47 chromosomes per cell. The average [[IQ]] of females with this syndrome is 90, while the average [[IQ]] of unaffected siblings is 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Bender B, Puck M, Salbenblatt J, Robinson A |title=Cognitive development of children with sex chromosome abnormalities |editor=Smith S |location=San Diego |publisher=College Hill Press |year=1986|pages=175–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their stature on average is taller than normal females. They are fertile and their children do not inherit the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/triple-x-syndrome | title=Triple X syndrome | website=Genetics Home Reference | date=2014-07-14 | accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Females with more than one extra copy of the X chromosome (48, [[XXXX syndrome]] or 49, [[XXXXX syndrome]]) have been identified, but these conditions are rare.

[[Turner syndrome]]:
* This results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes the features of the condition, including short stature and infertility.
* About half of individuals with Turner syndrome have [[monosomy]] X (45,X), which means each cell in a woman's body has only one copy of the X chromosome instead of the usual two copies. Turner syndrome can also occur if one of the sex chromosomes is partially missing or rearranged rather than completely missing. Some women with Turner syndrome have a chromosomal change in only some of their cells. These cases are called Turner syndrome mosaics (45,X/46,XX).

==== X-linked recessive disorders ====
[[Sex linkage]] was first discovered in insects, e.g., [[Thomas Hunt Morgan|T. H. Morgan]]'s 1910 discovery of the pattern of inheritance of  the white eyes mutation in [[Drosophila melanogaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=T. H.|date=1910|title=Sex-limited inheritance in Drosophila|url=|journal=Science|volume=32|pages=120–122|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such discoveries helped to explain x-linked disorders in humans, e.g., [[haemophilia]] A and B, [[adrenoleukodystrophy]], and [[Color blindness|red-green color]] blindness.

====Other disorders====
{{Further information|X-linked recessive|X-linked dominant}}
[[XX male syndrome]] is a rare disorder, where the [[SRY]] region of the Y chromosome has recombined to be located on one of the X chromosomes. As a result, the XX combination after fertilization has the same effect as a XY combination, resulting in a male. However, the other genes of the X chromosome cause feminization as well.

[[X-linked endothelial corneal dystrophy]] is an extremely rare disease of cornea associated with Xq25 region. [[Lisch epithelial corneal dystrophy]] is associated with Xp22.3.

[[Megalocornea|Megalocornea 1]] is associated with Xq21.3-q22{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2015}}

[[Adrenoleukodystrophy]], a rare and fatal disorder that is carried by the mother on the x-cell. It affects only boys between the ages of 5 and 10 and destroys the protective cell surrounding the nerves, [[myelin]], in the brain. The female carrier hardly shows any symptoms because females have a copy of the x-cell. This disorder causes a once healthy boy to lose all abilities to walk, talk, see, hear, and even swallow. Within 2 years after diagnosis, most boys with Adrenoleukodystrophy die.

====Role in mental abilities and intelligence====

The X-chromosome has played a crucial role in the development of sexually selected characteristics for over 300 million years. During that time it has accumulated a disproportionate number of genes concerned with mental functions. For reasons that are not yet understood, there is an excess proportion of genes on the X-chromosome that are associated with the development of intelligence, with no obvious links to other significant biological functions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = X-linked genes and mental functioning|journal = Human Molecular Genetics|date = 2005-04-15|issn = 0964-6906|pmid = 15809269|pages = R27–32|volume = 14 Spec No 1|doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddi112|first = David H.|last = Skuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A systems biology approach to identify intelligence quotient score-related genomic regions, and pathways relevant to potential therapeutic treatments|journal = Scientific Reports|date = 2014-02-25|issn = 2045-2322|pmc = 3933868|pmid = 24566931|volume = 4|pages = 4176|doi = 10.1038/srep04176|first = Min|last = Zhao|first2 = Lei|last2 = Kong|first3 = Hong|last3 = Qu}}&lt;/ref&gt; . In other words, a significant proportion of genes associated with intelligence is passed on to the male offspring from the maternal side and to the female offspring from either/both maternal and paternal side.There has also been interest in the possibility that haploinsufficiency for one or more X-linked genes has a specific impact on development of the [[Amygdala]] and its connections with cortical centres involved in social–cognition processing or the ‘social brain'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Variation in the X-linked EFHC2 gene is associated with social cognitive abilities in males|journal = PLOS ONE|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1932-6203|pmc = 4481314|pmid = 26107779|pages = e0131604|volume = 10|issue = 6|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0131604|first = Carla M.|last = Startin|first2 = Chiara|last2 = Fiorentini|first3 = Michelle|last3 = de Haan|first4 = David H.|last4 = Skuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=November 2015}}
