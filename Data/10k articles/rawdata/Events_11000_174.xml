===American presence in Libya and Benghazi===
Within months of the start of the Libyan revolution in February 2011, the CIA began building a covert presence in Benghazi.&lt;ref name="NYT_CIA_Libya"&gt;Schmitt, Eric; Cooper, Helene; Schmidt, Michael S.

Eastern Libya and Benghazi were key intelligence-gathering hubs for intelligence operatives. Before the attack, the CIA was monitoring [[Ansar al-Sharia (Libya)|Ansar al-Sharia]] and suspected members of [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]], as well as attempting to define the leadership and loyalty of the various militias present and their interaction with the [[Salafi movement|Salafi]] elements of Libyan society.&lt;ref name="NYT_CIA_Libya"/&gt; By the time of the attack, dozens of CIA operatives were on the ground in Benghazi.&lt;ref name="CNN_Griffin_CIA"&gt;Griffin, Drew; Johnston, Kathleen.

In May 2012, an Al-Qaida affiliate calling itself the "Brigades of the Imprisoned Sheikh [[Omar Abdel-Rahman|Omar Abdul Rahman]]" claimed responsibility for an attack on the [[International Red Cross]] (ICRC) office in Benghazi.

On June 18, 2012, the Tunisian consulate in Benghazi was attacked by individuals affiliated with [[Ansar al-Sharia (Libya)|Ansar al-Sharia]], allegedly because of "attacks by Tunisian artists against Islam".&lt;ref name="benghazi_defin_report"/&gt;{{rp|31}}

On the day of the attack, two consulate security guards spotted a man in a Libyan police uniform taking pictures of the consulate with his cell phone from a nearby building that was under construction. The security guards briefly detained the man before releasing him. He drove away in a police car and a complaint was made to the Libyan police station. [[Sean Smith (diplomat)|Sean Smith]] noticed this surveillance, and messaged a friend online around noon, "Assuming we don't die tonight. We saw one of our 'police' that guard the compound taking pictures."&lt;ref name="benghazi_defin_report"/&gt;{{rp|34}}

According to a local security official, he and a battalion commander had met with U.S. diplomats three days before the attack and warned the Americans about deteriorating security in the area.

U.S. security officer Eric Nordstrom twice requested additional security for the mission in Benghazi from the State Department. His requests were denied and according to Nordstrom, State Department official Charlene Lamb wanted to keep the security presence in Benghazi "artificially low".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/09/us-libya-usa-idUSBRE89815N20121009 |title=U.S. officer got no reply to requests for more security in Benghazi |date=October 9, 2012 |agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 30, 2012, the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs released a report, "Flashing Red: A Special Report on the Terrorist Attack at Benghazi", wherein it was determined:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the months [between February 2011 and September 11, 2012] leading up to the attack on the Temporary Mission Facility in Benghazi, there was a large amount of evidence gathered by the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) and from open sources that Benghazi was increasingly dangerous and unstable, and that a significant attack against American personnel there was becoming much more likely. While this intelligence was effectively shared within the Intelligence Community (IC) and with key officials at the Department of State, it did not lead to a commensurate increase in security at Benghazi nor to a decision to close the American mission there, either of which would have been more than justified by the intelligence presented. ... The RSO [Regional Security Officer] in Libya compiled a list of 234 security incidents in Libya between June 2011 and July 2012, 50 of which took place in Benghazi.&lt;ref name="collins.senate.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo33519/Flashing%20Red-HSGAC%20Special%20Report%20final.pdf|title=Flashing Red: A Special Report On The Terrorist Attack At Benghazi|date=30 December 2012|publisher=United States Senate Committee On Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The desire of the State Department to maintain a low profile in Benghazi has been cited as the reason why the State Department circumvented their own Overseas Security Policy Board (OSPB) standards for diplomatic security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Scott|title=Trust Betrayed: Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the Selling Out of America's National Security|publisher=Regnery Publishing|date=2015|ISBN=978-1-62157-327-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74–75}}  In the aftermath, Clinton sought to take responsibility for the security lapses at Benghazi and expressed personal regret.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/secretary-of-state-hillary-clinton-takes-responsibility-for-benghazi-attack/ |title=Secretary of State Hillary Clinton takes "responsibility" for Benghazi attack |date=October 18, 2012 |publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her January 2013 testimony before Congress, Secretary Clinton claimed security decisions at the Benghazi compound had been made by others, stating, "The specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi ... were handled by the security professionals in the [State] Department.

===Assault on the compound===

One Libyan guard who was wounded in the attack was quoted as saying "there wasn't a single ant outside [before the attack]."&lt;ref name=McClatchy/&gt; According to [[Media Matters For America]], the attackers stated they were acting in response to ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]''.&lt;ref name="Gertz"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gertz|first=Matt|title=Four Media Reports From Libya That Linked The Benghazi Attacks To The Anti-Islam Video|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/05/14/four-media-reports-from-libya-that-linked-the-b/194073|publisher=Media Matters For America|accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; No more than seven Americans were in the compound, including Ambassador Stevens.

Stevens had his last meeting of the day with a Turkish diplomat, and escorted the Turkish diplomat to the main gate at about 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time. The street outside the compound was calm, and the State Department reported no unusual activity during the day outside.&lt;ref name="StateBriefing"&gt;{{cite web |title=Background Briefing on Libya |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/10/198791.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State|date=October 9, 2012 |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevens retired to his room at about 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="NYTTimeline"/&gt;

After some discussion, the CIA's Global Response Staff (GRS) at the CIA annex, which included [[Tyrone S. Woods]], decided to attempt a rescue. By 10:05&amp;nbsp;p.m., the team was briefed and loaded into their armored Toyota Land Cruisers. By this time, communicators at the CIA annex were notifying the chain of command about current developments, and a small CIA and JSOC element in Tripoli that included [[Glen Doherty]] was attempting to find a way to Benghazi.&lt;ref name="benghazi_defin_report"/&gt;{{rp|39–43}}

The GRS team from the [[CIA]] annex arrived at the consulate and attempted to secure the perimeter and locate the ambassador and Sean Smith. Diplomatic security agent David Ubben located Smith,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jul/25/benghazi-hero-david-ubben-still-recovering-walter-/ Jessica Chasmar, "Benghazi hero David Ubben still recovering at Walter Reed"] ''[[The Washington Times]]'', July 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; who was unconscious and later declared dead, but the team was unable to find Stevens in the smoke-filled building. The team then decided to return to the annex with the survivors and Smith's body. While en route back to the annex, the group's armored vehicle was hit by [[AK-47]] rifle fire and hand grenades. The vehicle was able to make it to its destination with two flat tires, and the gates to the annex were closed behind them at 11:50&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="benghazi_defin_report"/&gt;{{rp|43–45}}&lt;ref name="BloombergOct9"/&gt;

A U.S. Army commando unit was sent to [[Naval Air Station Sigonella]] in Sicily, Italy the night of the attack but did not deploy to Benghazi. U.S. officials say the team did not arrive at Sigonella until after the attack was over.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Martin (journalist)|David Martin]], [http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57539738/u.s-military-poised-for-rescue-in-benghazi/ "U.S. military poised for rescue in Benghazi"] ''[[CBS News]]'' October 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction in the United States===
[[Diplomatic Security Service]] agents/[[Regional Security Officer]]s informed their headquarters in Washington about the attack just as it was beginning at about 9:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time (3:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time (ET)). At the time, they were informed that the attack was a "terrorist attack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|title=Panetta: 'From The Beginning' I Knew Benghazi Was A Terrorist Attack|url=http://freebeacon.com/politics/panetta-from-the-beginning-i-knew-benghazi-was-a-terrorist-attack|newspaper=Washington Free Beacon|date=October 7, 2014|accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news|author=James Rosen|title=The Benghazi Transcripts: Top Defense officials briefed Obama on 'attack,' not video or protest|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/01/14/benghazi-transcripts-top-defense-officials-briefed-obama-on-attack-not-video-or|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=January 14, 2014|accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news|author=Leslie Larson|title=Pentagon labeled Benghazi a terrorist attack as Obama administration wavered: newly declassified testimony|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/pentagon-labeled-benghazi-terrorist-attack-obama-administration-wavered-newly-declassified-tes-article-1.1579141|newspaper=Daily News|location=New York|date=January 14, 2014|accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, through September 14, CIA analysts made a contradictory assessment, stating "We believe based on currently available information that the attacks in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. Consulate and subsequently its annex. The crowd almost certainly was a mix of individuals from across many sectors of Libyan society. That being said, we do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/benghazi-memo-drafts/315398/|title=The Benghazi Memo Drafts, as They Evolved|first=Philip|last=Bump|publisher=|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET, Pentagon officials had informed Defense Secretary [[Leon Panetta]] about the attack. The Pentagon ordered an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] that was in the air conducting surveillance on militant camps to fly over Benghazi. The drone arrived at 11:10&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time (5:10&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET) and began providing a video feed to Washington. At 5:41&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET, Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] telephoned CIA Director [[David Petraeus]] to coordinate. The CIA, which made up most of the U.S. government's presence in Benghazi, had a ten-member security team at its annex and the State Department believed that this team would assist the consulate in the event of an attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Entous|first=Adam|title=CIA Takes Heat for Role in Libya |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204712904578092853621061838 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=November 1, 2012|author2=Gorman, Siobhan |author3=Coker, Margaret  |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assault on the CIA annex===
Just after midnight, the CIA annex came under machine gun, rocket and mortar fire. The CIA defenders held off the attack until the morning.&lt;ref name="benghazi_defin_report"/&gt;{{rp|45–46}}  That same morning, Libyan government forces met up with a group of Americans, reinforcements from Tripoli including [[Glen Doherty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Erik |last= Wemple |date=November 16, 2012 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/fox-news-mangled-huge-benghazi-story/2012/11/16/c2d152c6-2f99-11e2-9f50-0308e1e75445_blog.html |title= Fox News mangled huge Benghazi story |authorlink= Erik Wemple |publisher=The Washington Post blog }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/26/who-was-glen-doherty/ |first= Jennifer |last= Griffin |title= Who was Glen Doherty?

The team, which included two active-duty JSOC operators and five CIA personnel, had commandeered a small jet in Tripoli by paying the pilots $30,000 and forcing them to fly to Benghazi.&lt;ref name="benghazi_defin_report"/&gt;{{rp|43}}  After being held up at the airport for a few hours, the Libyan forces and newly arrived Americans went to the CIA annex at about 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to assist in transporting approximately 32 Americans at the annex back to the airport for evacuation. Minutes after they drove through the gates, the annex came under heavy fire. With a lull in the fighting, Doherty began searching for his friend, [[Tyrone S. Woods]], and he was told he was on the roof. He found Woods on the roof with two other agents. A mortar round then hit Woods' position, fatally wounding him. As Doherty attempted to reposition and take cover, a second round fell on him, killing him.&lt;ref name="benghazi_defin_report"/&gt;{{rp|46–47}}&lt;ref name="FOXOct24"&gt;[[Jennifer Griffin]], [http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/10/24/us-military-response-questioned-in-wake-deadly-libya-attack/ US military's response questioned in wake] [[Fox News Channel]] October 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 31-year-old [[Diplomatic Security Service]] Special Agent David Ubben suffered [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] injuries and several broken bones in the mortar attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/04/14215003-dad-of-us-bodyguard-blown-up-twice-in-benghazi-says-state-department-should-admit-mistakes Dad of U.S. bodyguard 'blown up twice' in Benghazi says State Department should admit mistakes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023084644/http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/04/14215003-dad-of-us-bodyguard-blown-up-twice-in-benghazi-says-state-department-should-admit-mistakes |date=October 23, 2012 }} ''[[NBC News]]'' October 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately, several agents ran onto the roof to assess damage and help the wounded. At the same time, a JSOC operator was using a hand-held device displaying images from a [[Predator drone]] above, which had been sent by the DOD's [[US Africa Command]] after request. The defenders agreed to evacuate to the airport and were attacked with small arms fire along the route.&lt;ref name="benghazi_defin_report"/&gt;{{rp|47–48}} The evacuation of about 30 Americans included six State Department personnel and Smith's body—they were unable to locate Ambassador Stevens at the time.

===Recovery of Ambassador Stevens===
Ambassador Stevens' body was found by a group of Libyans who had accessed the room through a window.&lt;ref name="rescue_Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/17/us-ambassador-video-idUSBRE88G19Y20120917 |title=Video shows Libyans helping rescue U.S. ambassador after attack|agency=Reuters|author=Al-Khalidi, Suleiman |date=September 17, 2012 |accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were unaware of his identity, and Abdel-Qader Fadl, a freelance photographer who was with them, told the [[Associated Press]] that Stevens was unconscious and "maybe moved his head, but only once".

===Responsibility===
On September 10, 2012, at least 18 hours before the attack in Benghazi, [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] released a video to coincide with the anniversary of the [[9/11 attacks]] in 2001, which called for attacks on Americans in Libya in order to avenge the death of [[Abu Yahya al-Libi]] in a drone strike in Pakistan in June 2012.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;  It is uncertain how much prior knowledge of the attack al-Zawahiri had, though he praised the attackers on October 12, 2012 in another video.&lt;ref&gt;[http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/11/12/analysts-search-for-clues-in-al-zawahiri-remarks-on-benghazi/ Paul Cruickshank, "Analysts search for clues in al-Zawahiri remarks on Benghazi"] CNN, November 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14, 2012, [[al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] released a statement arguing the attack was revenge for the death of al-Libi, though they did not claim official responsibility for the Benghazi attack.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;  It was later reported that 3 operatives from the group did take part in the attack.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;  Further, an intercepted phone call from the Benghazi area immediately after the attack reportedly linked senior [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] commander [[Mokhtar Belmokhtar]] to the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/05/world/africa/benghazi-al-qaeda Paul Cruickshank, Tim Lister and Nic Robertson, "Phone call links Benghazi attack to al Qaeda commander"] CNN, March 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Kirkpatrick of ''The New York Times'' reported that 20-year-old neighbor Mohamed Bishari witnessed the attack. According to Bishari, it was launched without warning or protest and was led by the [[Islamist]] militia [[Ansar al-Sharia (Libya)|Ansar al-Sharia]] (different from the group called [[Ansar al-Sharia (Yemen)|Ansar al-Sharia based in Yemen]] designated by the U.N. and the U.S. Department of State as a terrorist organization&lt;ref name="US4OCT12"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/10/198659.htm |title=Terrorist Designations of Ansar al-Sharia as an Alias for Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula |date=October 4, 2012 |publisher=Office of the Spokesperson, U.S. Department of State|accessdate=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Witnesses, Benghazi residents, and Western news reports have described him as a leader of Ansar al-Sharia, though he stated he was close to the group but not an official part of it. He further stated he was the commander of an Islamist brigade, Abu Obaida ibn al-Jarrah, some of whose members had joined Ansar al-Sharia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/world/africa/suspect-in-benghazi-attack-scoffs-at-us.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 David Kirkpatrick, "Suspect in Libya Attack, in Plain Sight, Scoffs at U.S."] ''The New York Times'', October 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi had called for release of the Blind Sheikh in his inaugural address.&lt;ref name="Forbes1222012"/&gt;

In the days and weeks following the attack, President Obama and other administration officials correctly noted that the video had sparked [[Reactions to Innocence of Muslims|violent incidents]] at a number of U.S. diplomatic facilities, and [[Susan Rice]] stated — based on a flawed CIA assessment — the video was also a prime catalyst for the Benghazi attack. In a phone call with the Egyptian prime minister [[Hesham Qandil|Kandil]] the day after the attack, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said "we know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack, not a protest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2016/06/the-benghazi-timeline-clinton-edition|title=The Benghazi Timeline, Clinton Edition - FactCheck.org|date=June 30, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assessment reflected information in an email sent by the State Department Operations Center to the White House, Pentagon, intelligence community and FBI at 6:07pm Eastern time the night of the attack, the subject line of which read, "Update 2: Ansar al-Sharia Claims Responsibility for Benghazi Attack."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-benghazi-emails/clinton-facebook-post-about-benghazi-attack-not-hard-evidence-idUSBRE89N12020121024|title=Clinton: Facebook post about Benghazi attack not hard|first=Mark|last=Hosenball|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, this assessment contradicted the assessment of CIA analysts, which through September 16 maintained that "the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo," at which violent protesters had scaled the embassy walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-usa-protest/egyptians-angry-at-film-scale-u-s-embassy-walls-idUSBRE88A11N20120911|title=Egyptians angry at film scale U.S. embassy walls|first=Tamim|last=Elyan|publisher=|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the day after the attack, Ansar al-Sharia appeared to confirm both assessments when it issued a statement saying The [Ansar al-Shariah] Brigade didn't participate as a sole entity; rather, it was a spontaneous popular uprising in response to what happened by the West," which was an apparent reference to the [[Innocence of Muslims]] video.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2012/09/ansar_al_shariah_issues_statem.php|title=Ansar al Shariah issues statement on US Consulate assault in Libya - FDD's Long War Journal|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 18 appearance on the ''Late Show with David Letterman'', President Obama said, "extremists and terrorists used (the anti-Muslim YouTube video) as an excuse to attack a variety of our embassies."&lt;ref name="POTLS19SEP2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama: U.S. consulate attack in Libya not an act of war|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/obama-us-consulate-attack-in-libya-not-an-act-of-war/2012/09/19/8e5b47ba-021f-11e2-bbf0-e33b4ee2f0e8_video.html|publisher=World Wide Pants|date=September 19, 2012|accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama spoke accurately, because five American ''embassies'' were the sites of violent protests due to the video, but Benghazi was not an ''embassy'', it was a "diplomatic post." In his Univision Town Hall appearance on September 20, President Obama said that the "natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Remarks by the President at Univision Town Hall with Jorge Ramos and Maria Elena Salinas|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/20/remarks-president-univision-town-hall-jorge-ramos-and-maria-elena-salina|publisher=White House|date=September 20, 2012|accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Innocence of Muslims]] video triggered dozens of protests from northwest Africa to southeast Asia, including violent protests at American embassies in Tunis, Khartoum, Cairo, Sana and Jakarta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/09/13/world/middleeast/spread-of-protests-sparked-by-anti-muslim-video.html|title=Spread of Protests Sparked by Anti-Muslim Video|publisher=|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libyan response===
[[File:Dr Mustafa Abushagur.JPG|thumb|right|Prime Minister Abushagur]]
[[List of heads of government of Libya|Libyan Prime Minister]] [[Mustafa Abushagur]]'s office condemned the attack and extended condolences, saying: "While strongly condemning any attempt to abuse the person of Muhammad, or an insult to our holy places and prejudice against the faith, we reject and strongly condemn the use of force to terrorize innocent people and the killing of innocent people."

====Anti-militia demonstrations====
On September 21, about 30,000 Libyans marched through Benghazi calling for support of the rule of law and for an end to the armed militias that had formed during the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] to oppose [[Colonel Gaddafi]].&lt;ref name=BBCMilitiaStormed&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19680785|title=Libya: Islamist militia bases stormed in Benghazi|publisher=BBC News |date=September 22, 2012 |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTMilitantsBesieged&gt;{{Cite news|title=Angry Libyans Target Militias, Forcing Flight|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/world/africa/pro-american-libyans-besiege-militant-group-in-benghazi.html?ref=world&amp;pagewanted=all |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 22, 2012 |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that war, the militias failed to disband, and continually menaced the Libyan government and populace.&lt;ref name=NYTMilitantsBesieged/&gt; Carrying signs with slogans such as "We Want Justice For Chris" and "Libya Lost a Friend", the protestors stormed several militia headquarters, including that of [[Ansar al-Sharia (Libya)|Ansar al-Sharia]], an [[Islamist]] militia who some allege played a role in the attack on U.S. diplomatic personnel on September 11.&lt;ref name=NBCProtestersBacklash&gt;{{cite news|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/21/14018495-protesting-libyans-storm-militant-compound-in-backlash-against-armed-groups|title=Protesting Libyans storm militant compound in backlash against armed groups|publisher=NBC News |accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GUKMilitiaOut&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/22/libyan-protesters-militia-benghazi|title=Libyan protesters force Islamist militia out of Benghazi|work=The Guardian |location=London|first=Conal|last=Urquhart|date=September 22, 2012 |accessdate=September 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 10 people were killed and dozens more wounded as militiamen fired on demonstrators at the headquarters of Sahaty Brigade, a pro-government militia "operating under the authority of the ministry of defence".&lt;ref name="BBCMilitiaStormed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GUKMilitiaOut"/&gt;&lt;ref name=RMilitiaSweptOut&gt;{{Cite news|title=UPDATE 3-Libyan Islamist militia swept out of Benghazi bases|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/09/22/film-protests-benghazi-idINL5E8KM1RQ20120922|agency=Reuters|date=September 22, 2012|accessdate=June 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early next morning, the protestors had forced militia members to flee and seized control of a number of compounds, releasing four prisoners found inside.&lt;ref name="NBCProtestersBacklash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GUKMilitiaOut"/&gt; Protesters burnt a car and a building of at least one facility, and looted weapons.&lt;ref name="BBCMilitiaStormed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTMilitantsBesieged"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GUKMilitiaOut"/&gt; The militia compounds and many weapons were handed over to Libya's national army&lt;ref name="NYTMilitantsBesieged"/&gt; in what "appeared to be part of a coordinated sweep of militia bases by police, government troops and activists" following the earlier demonstrations.&lt;ref name="NBCProtestersBacklash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GUKMilitiaOut"/&gt; Some militia members accused the protestors of being [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] loyalists, looking to disarm the militias in the wake of the revolution.&lt;ref name="NYTMilitantsBesieged"/&gt;

====Government campaign to disband militias====
On September 23, taking advantage of the growing momentum and rising anger against the militias evinced in the earlier anti-militia demonstrations,&lt;ref name="GovtSeizesMomentum"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/nationworld/ci_21615270/libya-orders-militias-operate-under-government-control-or|title=Libya orders militias to operate under government control or disband|author=Osama Alfitory|work=The Denver Post|date=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Libyan president declared that all unauthorized militias had 48 hours to either disband or come under government control.&lt;ref name="MilitiasRaided"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/09/2012923221126439787.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|title=Libyan forces raid militia outposts|date=September 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MilitiasOutlawed"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2012/09/2012924105056388919.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|title=Disbanding Libya's militias|date=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also mandated that bearing arms in public was now illegal, as were armed checkpoints.&lt;ref name="MilitiasOutlawed"/&gt;

Handling the militias had been difficult as the government had been forced to rely on some of them for protection and security.&lt;ref name="GovtSeizesMomentum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MilitiasRaided"/&gt; According to a Libyan interviewed in Tripoli, the government gained the ability to push back against the militias because of a "mandate of the people".&lt;ref name="MilitiasRaided"/&gt; On September 24, the government commenced with a raid on a former military base held by a rogue infantry militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/23/world/africa/libya-militias/index.html|title=Libyan troops raid rogue brigade's base|author=Karadsheh, Jomana|date=September 24, 2012|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the country, militias began surrendering to the government. The government formed a "National Mobile Force" for the purpose of evicting illegal militias.&lt;ref name="MilitiasEvicted"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/25/world/africa/libya-militias/index.html|title=Libya's army evicts unauthorized militias|publisher=CNN|date=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day as the declaration, various militias in Misrata held meetings, ultimately deciding to submit to the government's authority, and handed over various public facilities they had been holding, including the city's three main jails, which were handed over to the authority of the Ministry of Justice.&lt;ref name="MilitiasRaided"/&gt; Hours before the announcement, in Derna, the two main militias (one of them Ansar al-Sharia) active in the city both withdrew, leaving both their five military bases behind.&lt;ref name="GovtSeizesMomentum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MilitiasRaided"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MilitiasEvicted"/&gt;

Hundreds of Libyans, mainly former rebel fighters, gathered in the city centers of Tripoli and Benghazi to hand over their weapons to the government on September 29.&lt;ref name="WeaponHandOver"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/09/29/libyans-hand-over-weapons/1603089|title=Hundreds of Libyans hand over their weapons|date=September 29, 2012|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign has been less successful in other areas, such as the remote [[Nafusa Mountains]], inhabited by the Nafusi-speaking [[Berbers|Berber minority]], where the Emirati news agency The National reported on September 23 that arms were being hoarded. The National also reported arms being hoarded in Misrata, despite simultaneous reporting by other outlets that militias were surrendering in Misrata.&lt;ref name="DefiantGunHoarding"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/africa/libyan-militias-amass-weapons-as-rivalries-surface|title=Libyan militias amass weapons as rivalries surface|work=The National|date=September 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was no intelligence that in any way could have been acted on to prevent these attacks. It is—I mean, I think the DNI spokesman was very declarative about this that the report is false. The report suggested that there was intelligence that was available prior to this that led us to believe that this facility would be attacked, and that is false&amp;nbsp;... We have no information to suggest that it was a preplanned attack. The unrest we've seen around the region has been in reaction to a video that Muslims, many Muslims find offensive.

On September 14, the remains of the slain Americans were returned to the U.S.; President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attended the ceremony. In her remarks Clinton said, "One young woman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said 'Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam.'

On September 16, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. [[Susan Rice]] appeared on [[Full Ginsburg|five major interview shows]] to discuss the attacks. Prior to her appearance, Rice was provided with "talking points" from a CIA memo,&lt;ref name="nyt22"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/us/politics/explanation-for-benghazi-attack-under-scrutiny.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Explanation for Benghazi Attack Under Scrutiny |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Eric |last=Schmitt |date=October 21, 2012 |subscription=yes |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi and subsequently its annex. There are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations.

This assessment may change as additional information is collected and analyzed and as currently available information continues to be evaluated.

The investigation is ongoing, and the U.S. government is working with Libyan authorities to bring to justice those responsible for the deaths of U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/world/text-describing-an-attack.htmlText: The Benghazi Talking Points] ''[[The New York Times]]'' 28 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Using these talking points as a guide, Rice stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Based on the best information we have to date, what our assessment is as of the present is in fact what began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in Cairo where, of course, as you know, there was a violent protest outside of our embassy—sparked by this hateful video. But soon after that spontaneous protest began outside of our consulate in Benghazi, we believe that it looks like extremist elements, individuals, joined in that— in that effort with heavy weapons of the sort that are, unfortunately, readily now available in Libya post-revolution. And that it spun from there into something much, much more violent. We do not—we do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned. I think it's clear that there were extremist elements that joined in and escalated the violence.

Since Rice's five television appearances, there have been persistent accusations that she had intentionally and repeatedly lied. However, none of the ten Benghazi investigations determined she had. For example, the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee "did not conclude that Rice or any other government official acted in bad faith or intentionally misled the American people," according to the Associated Press.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/ecc3a300383445d5a90dd6ca764c9e15|title=House intel panel debunks many Benghazi theories|publisher=|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a White House press briefing on September 18, press secretary Jay Carney explained the attack to reporters: "I'm saying that based on information that we—our initial information, and that includes all information—we saw no evidence to back up claims by others that this was a preplanned or premeditated attack; that we saw evidence that it was sparked by the reaction to this video.

On September 20, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney answered a question about an open hearing with the [[National Counterterrorism Center]] Director, [[Matthew G. Olsen]], which referenced which extremist groups might have been involved. Carney said, "It is, I think, self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Our embassy was attacked violently, and the result was four deaths of American officials. So, again, that's self-evident."&lt;ref&gt;[https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/20/press-gaggle-press-secretary-jay-carney-en-route-miami-fl-9202012 Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney en route Miami, FL, 9/20/2012], White House, October 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, during an appearance on [[Univision]], a Spanish-language television network in the United States, President Obama stated, "What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=As Carney labels Libya strike terrorism, Obama continues to incorrectly cite anti-Islam film|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/09/20/carney-elf-evident-benghazi-attack-was-terrorism/|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Obama's Responses To Libya Questions At Univision Forum Contradicted By Reports Of The Attack|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/obamas-responses-to-libya-questions-at-univision-forum-contradicted-by-reports-of-the-attack/|publisher=Mediaite |date=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Obama pressed on failures at Univision forum|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81470.html|work=Politico|date=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Obama defends embassy security during Univision town hall|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-obama-defends-embassy-security-20120920,0,1417694.story|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 20, 2012|first=Christi|last=Parsons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Univision's Town Hall Meeting With President Obama|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/09/20/obamas_town_hall_meeting_on_univision_115533.html|publisher=Real Clear Politics|date=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, advertisements condemning an anti-Islam video appeared on Pakistani television. The television ads in Pakistan (marked with the U.S. Embassy seal) feature clips of President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton during press appearances in Washington in which they condemned the video. Their words were subtitled in Urdu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/anti-film-ads-in-pakistan-feature-obama-clinton/|title=Anti-film ads in Pakistan feature Obama, Clinton|publisher=CBS News|date=September 24, 2012|accessdate=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, in an address before the [[United Nations General Assembly]] President Obama stated, "The attacks on our civilians in Benghazi were attacks on America&amp;nbsp;... And there should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice."&lt;ref name="iipdigital.usembassy.925"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-president-obama-delivers-remarks-united-nations-invokes/story?id=17319652#.UHeeWMXA_Zd|title=Transcript: President Obama Talks to the U.N. about Mideast Peace, Iran|date=September 27, 2012|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He referred to ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]'' as "a crude and disgusting video [that] sparked outrage throughout the Muslim world".

On September 26, Clinton acknowledged a possible link between [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] and the Benghazi attack.&lt;ref name="NYTSep26"/&gt;

On September 28, a spokesman for the Director of National Intelligence stated,
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the immediate aftermath, there was information that led us to assess that the attack began spontaneously following protests earlier that day at our embassy in Cairo. We provided that initial assessment to Executive Branch officials and members of Congress&amp;nbsp;... As we learned more about the attack, we revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists. It remains unclear if any group or person exercised overall command and control of the attack, and if extremist group leaders directed their members to participate.&lt;ref name="dni"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Statement by the Director of Public Affairs for the Director of National Intelligence, Shawn Turner, on the intelligence related to the terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya | publication-date=September 28, 2012 | publisher = Office of the Director of National Intelligence | url = http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Press%20Releases/ODNI_Benghazi_Statement_9.28.2012.pdf | format = PDF |accessdate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also on September 28, it was reported that [[Nakoula Basseley Nakoula]], the producer of the ''Innocence of Muslims'' video, had been arrested in California and was being held without bail for alleged probation violations stemming from a 2010 bank fraud conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Producer of anti-Islam film arrested, ordered held without bail |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/27/world/california-anti-islam-filmmaker/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=September 28, 2012 |accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[CNN|CNN's]] ''[[State of the Union with Candy Crowley]]'' on September 30, Crowley observed that "Friday we got the administration's sort of definitive statement that this now looks as though it was a pre-planned attack by a terrorist group, some of whom were at least sympathetic to al Qaeda," and asked the senior Republican on the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]], Senator [[John McCain]], "why do you think and are you bothered that it has taken them this long from September 11th to now to get to this conclusion?" to which McCain replied that "it interferes with the depiction that the administration is trying to convey that al Qaeda is on the wane&amp;nbsp;... how else could you trot out our U.N. ambassador to say this was a spontaneous demonstration?&amp;nbsp;... It was either willful ignorance or abysmal intelligence to think that people come to spontaneous demonstrations with heavy weapons, mortars, and the attack goes on for hours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State of the Union with Candy Crowley, Interview with John McCain; Interview with David Axelrod; Interview with Martin O'Malley, Roy Blunt|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1209/30/sotu.01.html|publisher=CNN|date=September 30, 2012|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 22 days after the attack, FBI investigators were finally allowed access to the scene of the attack.&lt;ref name="fbiaccess"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/fbi-came-and-went-benghazi-past-24-hours | title=FBI came to Benghazi and left in past 24 hours |agency=Associated Press |date=October 4, 2012 |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crime scene was not secured during that time; neither American nor Libyan investigators were able to secure the scene. The hearing testimony revealed that "Hicks argued that Rice's comments so insulted the Libyan president—since they contradicted his Sept. 16 claims that the attack was premeditated—that it slowed the FBI's investigation. 'President Magariaf was insulted in front of his own people, in front of the world.

To assist the Libyan government in disbanding extremist groups, the Obama administration allocated $8 million to begin building an elite Libyan commando force over the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. to Help Create an Elite Libyan Force to Combat Islamic Extremists|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/world/africa/us-to-help-create-libyan-commando-force.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 15, 2012 |first=Eric |last=Schmitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Presidential debate of October 16, 2012, between President Obama and [[Mitt Romney]], Romney claimed that "it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror." President Obama responded, "The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people and the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened," Obama said. "That this was an act of terror, and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CNN Fact Check: A day after Libya attack, Obama described it as 'acts of terror' |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/17/politics/fact-check-terror |publisher=CNN |date=October 17, 2012 |accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Romney challenged Obama, asking "You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror. It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?" the President responded, "Please proceed, governor" and "Get the transcript." The moderator of the debate, Candy Crowley, agreed, stating "He—he did call it an act of terror." A CNN analysis stated that Obama had indeed referred to the incident as a "terrorist attack", but that Romney was correct in noting that the administration delayed in conclusively stating that the attack was not a spontaneous protest related to the video.&lt;ref name=CNN-Crowley&gt;{{cite news|last=Monroe|first=Bryan|title=The truth about what Candy Crowley said|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/18/politics/fact-check-crowley-critics-debate/ |publisher=CNN|date=October 20, 2012 |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A May 14, 2013 Fact Checker by Glenn Kesler said that Obama repeatedly used the phrase "act of terror" when talking about the attack, but he did not directly state that the attack was an act of terror.&lt;ref name="WaPoMay2013"/&gt;

On October 19, 2012, House Oversight Committee Chairman [[Darrell Issa]] (R-CA) came under fire from intelligence officials in the Obama administration when he posted, on a public website, 166 pages of sensitive but unclassified State Department communications related to Libya. According to officials, the release of the unredacted documents compromised the identities of several Libyans working with the U.S. government and placed their lives in danger.&lt;ref name="IssaDocDump"&gt;[http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/10/19/issa_s_benghazi_document_dump_exposes_several_libyans_working_with_the_us Josh Rogin, "Issa's Benghazi document dump exposes several Libyans working with the U.S."] ''Foreign Policy'', October 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[CBS|CBS's]] ''[[Face the Nation]]'' on October 28, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) stated that "this is either a massive cover-up or incompetence" and suggested that it was a scandal worse than [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]]. McCain stated, "we know that there were tapes, recordings inside the consulate during this fight&amp;nbsp;... So the president went on various shows, despite what he said in the Rose Garden, about terrorist acts, he went on several programs, including ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]],'' including ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Letterman]]'', including before the UN where he continued to refer, days later, many days later, to this as a spontaneous demonstration because of a hateful video.

Secretary Clinton was scheduled to testify before [[United States Congress|Congress]] on December 20 about the attack. On December 15, it was reported that she had become dehydrated from the flu, fainted, and sustained a concussion. Consequently, her testimony was postponed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Hillary Clinton Benghazi Testimony Postponed After Secretary Of State Sustains Concussion |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/15/hillary-clinton-benghazi-testimony_n_2308153.html |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident prompted Republican Rep.

On January 23, 2013, during testimony at a Senate hearing on Benghazi, Clinton engaged in a heated exchange with Senator [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]]. When Johnson pressed her to explain why, in the immediate aftermath, no one from the State Department had asked American evacuees if there had been a protest before the attack, Clinton replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With all due respect, the fact is, we had four dead Americans! Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night and decided they'd go kill some Americans?! What difference, at this point, does it make?! It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator. Now, honestly, I will do my best to answer your questions about this, but the fact is that people were trying in real time to get to the best information. The [Intelligence Community] has a process, I understand, going with the other committees to explain how these talking points came out. But you know, to be clear, it is, from my perspective, less important today looking backwards as to why these militants decided they did it than to find them and bring them to justice, and then maybe we'll figure out what was going on in the meantime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=In Context: Hillary Clinton's 'What difference does it make' comment |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/may/08/context-hillary-clintons-what-difference-does-it-m/ |work=Tampa Bay Times |date=May 7, 2013 |accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics including [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] members accused the Obama White House and State Department of over-emphasizing or fabricating the role of Islamic anger over the anti-Islamic movie ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]'' and alleged that the administration was reluctant to label the attack as "terrorist".&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/26/world/africa/libya-investigation/index.html Sources: 15 days after Benghazi attack, FBI still investigating from afar] [[CNN]] September 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Representative [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]] (R-MI), chairman of the [[House Intelligence Committee]], who on September 13 said that the attacks had all the hallmarks of a coordinated attack by [[al-Qaeda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Congressman: Consulate attack in Libya was coordinated |author=Green, J.J. |url=http://wtop.com/?nid=893&amp;sid=3033617 |publisher=[[WTOP-FM|WTOP]] |date=September 13, 2012 |accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; has questioned whether there were any protests at all in Benghazi, saying: "I have seen no information that shows that there was a protest going on as you have seen around any other embassy at the time.

GOP legislators also took issue with delays in the investigation, which CNN attributed to "bureaucratic infighting" between the FBI, [[United States Department of Justice|Justice]], and [[United States Department of State|State]]. On September 26, Senator [[Johnny Isakson]] (R-Georgia) said he "cannot believe that the FBI is not on the ground yet".&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

Testimony from top U.S. commanders after the attack revealed that the military was unprepared for conflict across Africa and the Middle East. No attack aircraft had been placed on high alert on September 11, the anniversary of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, and the closest fighter planes to trouble spots in North Africa were based in Aviano, Italy. The fighter planes based in Aviano were unarmed and no aerial refueling planes were within a 10-hour flight to the base. In addition, no [[AC-130]] gunships were within a 10-hour flight of Libya, and their crews did not reach a staging base in Italy until 19 hours after the attack began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Benghazi Transcripts: US military woefully unprepared for attack, documents show |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/01/13/benghazi-transcripts-us-military-woefully-unprepared-for-attack-documents-show/ |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=January 14, 2014 |accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the attack and subsequent criticism occurring in the last two months of the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 U.S. Presidential election]], Democrats and liberal media figures accused Republicans of politicizing the attacks in an unprecedented manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barrett |first=Wayne |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/170742/romney-campaign-media-collude-unprecedented-politicization-benghazi-attack |title=Romney Campaign, Media Collude in Unprecedented Politicization of Benghazi Attack |work=The Nation |date=October 22, 2012 |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller |first=Zeke J |url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/05/10/romney-to-blame-for-gop-focus-on-benghazi/ |title=White House: GOP Focus On Benghazi Tied To Mitt Romney |work=Time |date=May 10, 2013 |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romney was accused by the Obama campaign of trying to exploit the attacks for political gain, leading the father of Ambassador Stevens to call for both campaigns to avoid making it a campaign issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Margaret |last=Talev |url=http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2012/10/ambassadors_dad_says_sons_deat.html |title=Ambassador's dad says son's death in Libya shouldn't be politicized |work=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland |date=October 15, 2012 |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Gates]], former [[CIA director]] and Defense Secretary under Republican Presidents and then President Obama until stepping down in July 2011, has said that some critics of the government's response have a "cartoonish" view of military capabilities. He stated that he would have responded with equal caution given the risks and the lack of intelligence on the ground, and that American forces require planning and preparation, which the circumstances did not allow for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3460_162-57584087/gates-some-benghazi-critics-have-cartoonish-view-of-military-capability/ |title=Gates: Some Benghazi critics have "cartoonish" view of military capability. |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White House Spokesman Jay Carney later specified that the criticism of the administration's handling of the Benghazi attacks was one of those "phony scandals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz |first=Ian |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/07/31/carney_identifies_which_scandals_obama_thinks_are_phony_benghazi_and_irs.html |title=Carney Identifies Which Scandals Obama Thinks Are Phony: Benghazi And IRS |publisher=RealClearPolitics |date=July 31, 2013 |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. media response===

Multiple conservative media outlets, most notably Fox News, promulgated an elaborate narrative of a scandal and cover-up by officials of the Obama administration, including, among other things, accusations that officials issued a "stand-down order" to preclude a military rescue operation; that officials knowingly lied by repeatedly asserting the attack was spontaneously triggered by the [[Innocence of Muslims]] video rather than a pre-planned terrorist attack; that a secret CIA gun-running operation to Syrian rebels was being conducted out of Libya; that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were absent and negligent on the night of the attack; that Hillary Clinton had personally declined multiple requests for more security at the compound; that a live video feed of the attack was viewed at the White House or State Department; that Ambassador Stevens had been captured by terrorists and dragged through the streets; and that witnesses had been prevented from testifying. These accusations were widely shared across various blogs and social media platforms. Ultimately, none of the accusations of scandal and cover-up were confirmed by any of the [[Investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack|ten Benghazi investigations]], including six investigations conducted by Republican-controlled congressional committees.

The [[Center for Media and Public Affairs]] at George Mason University described the conclusions of an unpublished study on November 2, 2012. Based on a textual analysis that tallied the occurrence of certain words and phrases in news reports during the days immediately following the attack, the study concluded that leading newspapers in the U.S. framed the attack in terms of a spontaneous protest over the anti-Islamic film ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]'' as framed by the Obama administration's version, four times as often as a planned terrorist attack, which was the Republican version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Study: Media accepted Obama version of Benghazi attack |author=Dinan, Stephen |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2012/nov/2/study-media-accepted-obama-version-benghazi-attack/ |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=November 2, 2012 |accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 2014 final report by the Republican-controlled [[House Intelligence Committee]] found that during the days immediately following the attack there was confusion among intelligence analysts as to the origin of the attack, leading to an initial assessment that it was the spontaneous outcome from a protest. Obama administration officials, most notably [[Susan Rice]], were provided this early assessment and repeated it to media outlets, only to be later contradicted as further intelligence assessments were made.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/benghazi-memo-drafts/315398/|title=The Benghazi Memo Drafts, as They Evolved|first=Philip|last=Bump|publisher=|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the ten investigations into Benghazi found that any senior Obama administration officials had acted improperly.

On September 13, [[Rachel Maddow]], during her show on [[MSNBC]], stated: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;An organized attack. Anybody who tells you that what happened to our ambassador and our consulate in Libya was as a result of a protest over an offensive movie, you should ask them why they think that. That's the first version of events we heard. That does not seem to explain what happened that night or by the facts or the more facts we get.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Rachel Maddow Show|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/49033879/ns/msnbc-rachel_maddow_show/t/rachel-maddow-show-thursday-september-th/#.UaqDx-tAtyB|publisher=MSNBC|date=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On June 2014, Maddow criticized the right-wing media for reporting an arrest as bad news, said that Americas are poorly served by the media, and that "the take on Fox News is that's not actually news" and now "they have to make it bad news, they have to make into maybe a scandal itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/watch/media-fails-americans-on-iraq-benghazi-283294275959|title=Americans poorly served by media on Iraq, Benghazi|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maddow: U.S. Got the Suspect and 'Benghazi Central' Fox News Doesn't Care?|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/maddow-u-s-got-the-suspect-and-%E2%80%98benghazi-central%E2%80%99-fox-news-doesn%E2%80%99t-care|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the edition of October 24 of Fox News' ''Special Report with Bret Baier'', syndicated columnist [[Charles Krauthammer]] claimed that a State Department e-mail, which passed along a report from Embassy Tripoli that Ansar al-Sharia had claimed responsibility for the attack on Facebook and Twitter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hosenball, Mark|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/24/us-usa-benghazi-emails-idUSBRE89N02C20121024|title=White House told of militant claim two hours after Libya attack: emails|agency=Reuters|date=October 23, 2012|accessdate=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT23OCT12"&gt;{{cite news|author=Schmitt, Eric|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/25/world/africa/us-e-mails-reveal-early-views-of-libya-attack.html|title=E-Mails Offer Glimpse at What U.S. Knew in First Hours After Attack in Libya|work=The New York Times|date=October 23, 2012|accessdate=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved that the White House knew of terrorist connections to the attack almost immediately. Krauthammer stated, "This is really a journalistic scandal. I mean, the fact there was not a word about any of this in the [New York] Times or the [Washington] Post today."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Krauthammer: Lack of Benghazi media coverage 'a journalistic scandal'|url=http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/25/krauthammer-lack-of-benghazi-media-coverage-a-journalistic-scandal/ |publisher=The Daily Caller|date=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the day after the Benghazi attack, Ansar al-Sharia issued a statement saying that the attack was in part "a spontaneous popular uprising in response to what happened by the West," which was an apparent reference to the [[Innocence of Muslims]] video.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Conservative pundit [[Jonah Goldberg]] of the ''[[National Review]]'' stated that on NBC's ''[[Meet the Press]]'', host [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]] changed the subject when a guest raised the subject of the Benghazi attack, saying, "Let's get to Libya a little bit later", but never returned to the subject.&lt;ref name="NOSurprise"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Benghazi: No 'October Surprise'|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/332103/benghazi-no-october-surprise-jonah-goldberg# |work= National Review|date=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=October 28: John Kasich, Scott Walker, John Hickenlooper, E.J.

On November 26, 2012, journalist [[Thomas E. Ricks (journalist)|Tom Ricks]] went on Fox News' ''[[Happening Now]]'' with [[Jon Scott]] to discuss the attack. While being interviewed on Fox News by Jon Scott, Ricks accused Fox News of being "extremely political" in its coverage of the attack and said that "Fox was operating as a wing of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]." Ricks accused the network of covering the story more than it needed to be. The interview was cut short and Ricks and the interview was not mentioned or covered by Fox News again. Fox News was subsequently criticized for cutting the interview short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Weinger, Mackenzie |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/11/tom-ricks-to-fox-news-the-network-operates-as-a-wing-150296.html |title=Tom Ricks to Fox News: The network operates 'as a wing of the Republican Party' |publisher=Politico |date=November 26, 2012 |accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wemple, Erik |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/ricks-fox-doesnt-care-about-story-behind-benghazi-story/2012/11/27/b4f4ee0e-38ab-11e2-b01f-5f55b193f58f_blog.html |title=Ricks: Fox doesn't care about story behind Benghazi story |work=The Washington Post |date=November 27, 2012 |accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the Associated Press, Fox News' White House correspondent [[Ed Henry]] suggested that he thought Benghazi was being covered too much by the network.

==Investigations==
{{Main|Investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack |Timeline of the investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack}}

There were ten investigations into the Benghazi matter: one by the FBI; one by an independent board commissioned by the State Department; two by Democrat-controlled Senate Committees; and six by Republican-controlled House Committees. After the first five Republican investigations found no evidence of wrongdoing by senior Obama administration officials, Republicans in 2014 opened a sixth investigation, the [[United States House Select Committee on Benghazi|House Select Committee on Benghazi]],  chaired by [[Trey Gowdy]]. This investigation also failed to find any evidence of wrongdoing by senior Obama administration officials. A possible political motive for the investigation was revealed on September 29, 2015, when Republican House majority leader [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]], then vying to become Speaker of the House, told [[Sean Hannity]] on Fox News that the investigation was part of a "strategy to fight and win,' adding "Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/30/politics/kevin-mccarthy-benghazi-committee-speaker/index.html|title=House Republicans repudiate Kevin McCarthy comments - CNNPolitics|first=Manu Raju, Deirdre Walsh and Tal Kopan,|last=CNN|publisher=|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/4519442873001/?#sp=show-clips|title=Rep.

Shortly after the Benghazi attack, Secretary of State Clinton commissioned an independent Accountability Review Board to investigate, chaired by retired ambassador [[Thomas R. Pickering]] with vice-chair retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [[Michael Mullen]]. The Board released their final report on December 19, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&amp;did=727502&lt;/ref&gt; It made 29 recommendations to the State Department on how to improve its operations, which Clinton pledged to implement.&lt;ref&gt;https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/203244.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this investigation, four career State Department officials were criticized for denying requests for additional security at the facility prior to the attack. By the end of 2012, [[Eric J. Boswell]], the Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security, resigned under pressure, while three others were suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/ap-three-state-dept-officials-to-resign-after-scathing-benghazi-report/2012/12/19/ad4ca7e8-49fc-11e2-820e-17eefac2f939_story.html|title=Four State Dept. officials disciplined after Benghazi probe|first1=Anne|last1=Gearan|first2=Greg|last2=Miller|date=December 19, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=April 2, 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the other Benghazi investigations identified wrongdoing by any individuals.

The [[United States House Select Committee on Benghazi|House Select Committee on Benghazi]]'s final report was released on June 28, 2016 and the committee closed down five months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/house-benghazi-committee-files-final-report-shuts-down-n695181|title=House Benghazi committee files final report and shuts down|publisher=|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; No further public investigations have been conducted since.

The findings of the two-year investigation by the Republican-controlled [[House Intelligence Committee]], the fifth of six Republican investigations, was summarized by the ''Associated Press'' on November 21, 2014:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/ecc3a300383445d5a90dd6ca764c9e15|title=House intel panel debunks many Benghazi theories|publisher=|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A two-year investigation by the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee has found that the CIA and the military acted properly in responding to the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, and asserted no wrongdoing by Obama administration appointees.

Debunking a series of persistent allegations hinting at dark conspiracies, the investigation of the politically charged incident determined that there was no intelligence failure, no delay in sending a CIA rescue team, no missed opportunity for a military rescue, and no evidence the CIA was covertly shipping arms from Libya to Syria.

In the immediate aftermath of the attack, intelligence about who carried it out and why was contradictory, the report found. That led Susan Rice, then U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to inaccurately assert that the attack had evolved from a protest, when in fact there had been no protest. But it was intelligence analysts, not political appointees, who made the wrong call, the committee found. The report did not conclude that Rice or any other government official acted in bad faith or intentionally misled the American people.

...

In the aftermath of the attacks, Republicans criticized the Obama administration and its then-secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is expected to run for president in 2016. People in and out of government have alleged that a CIA response team was ordered to "stand down" after the State Department compound came under attack, that a military rescue was nixed, that officials intentionally downplayed the role of al-Qaida figures in the attack, and that Stevens and the CIA were involved in a secret operation to spirit weapons out of Libya and into the hands of Syrian rebels. None of that is true, according to the House Intelligence Committee report.

The report did find, however, that the State Department facility where Stevens and Smith were killed was not well-protected, and that State Department security agents knew they could not defend it from a well-armed attack. Previous reports have found that requests for security improvements were not acted upon in Washington.}}

==FOIA requests==
[[File:Montage of 7 FOIA photographs from Department of State.jpg|thumb|700px|Montage of seven photographs released under a FOIA request from Judicial Watch to the Department of State]]
[[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests have been made since the attack. The conservative foundation [[Judicial Watch]] filed a FOIA request to the Department of State on December 19, 2012. An acknowledgement of the request was received by Judicial Watch on January 4, 2013. When the State Department failed to respond to the request by February 4, 2013, Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit, which resulted in seven photographs being delivered on June 6, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-obtains-first-photos-from-state-department-depicting-aftermath-of-benghazi-attack/|title=Judicial Watch Obtains First Photos from State Department Depicting Aftermath of Benghazi Attack|publisher=Judicial Watch|date=June 21, 2013|accessdate=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the photographs show Arabic-language spray paint graffiti.

Sharpe | year = 1992 | page = 24 | isbn = 0873328892 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] folk name for the [[Feast of the Transfiguration]], which is observed on August 19.

It is the second of the three Feasts of the Saviour. The others are the ''Honey Feast of the Saviour'', which is celebrated on August 14 (or August 1, Julian Calendar) and the ''Nut Feast of the Saviour'', which is celebrated on August 29 (or August 16, Julian Calendar).

The holiday has a pre-Christian origin and is associated with harvesting of ripe fruits, especially apples. In the Byzantine Empire there was tradition to bless harvested grapes during the Feast of Transfiguration. In Russia, apples are more common than grapes, hence the name of the feast. There are processions and blessings of harvests. Usually, on that day, people from [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] eat apples, apple pies, or other dishes containing apples, even if they are not Orthodox Christians.&lt;gallery&gt;

'''BAALS''' is a [[music festival]] which is primarily focused on electronic dance music, dance music and jam bands. The festival takes place in the city of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] and has been organized since 2012. Each year the festival earmarks and donates $5,000 to a local charity, cause or nonprofit. The first edition of the festival took place in 2012 as a downtown block part called House 4 a House. In 2014 the festival expanded to Headwaters Park at which point it changed its name to the BAALS Music Festival.

== History ==

The event began on July 13, 2012 as a downtown block party entitled House4aHouse. The host of the event was an advocacy group called [[A Better Fort]]  who coincided the block party with another festival called The Three Rivers Festival.  This block party raised $5,000, donated it to a  local non-profit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wane.com/2014/07/11/baals-summer-block-party-promises-local-djs-drink-specials-and-more/|title= #BAALS Summer Block Party Promises Local DJs, Drink Specials, and More|author= WANE Staff Reports|date= July 11, 2014|publisher=Wane.com|accessdate= December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and garnered 2,000 attendees in its first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20140711/ENT/307119997 |title=Building a Bigger House Party |first=Keiara |last=Carr |date=July 11, 2014 |publisher=Journal Gazette |accessdate=December 9, 2014 }}{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the inaugural year the city of Fort Wayne endured ridicule, including multiple skits on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', as the city explored naming a government building the “Harry Baals Government Center” after a former city Mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://lynchpincreative.co/2014/07/a-story-of-city-building-harry-baals-joke/97|title= A Story of City Building behind the Harry Baals Joke|date=July 7, 2014|publisher= Lynchpin Creative|accessdate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/16/harry-baals-government-center-jimmy-kimmel_n_836564.html|title= Jimmy Kimmel Grills Ft.

'''''Burton and Speke''''' is a 1982 historical novel by [[William Harrison (author)|William Harrison]] recounting the 1857 expedition of the search for the [[Nile#The search for the source of the Nile|source of the Nile]] by the famous Victorian explorer, linguist and anthropologist [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]] and English aristocrat and amateur hunter [[John Hanning Speke]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/620037.Mountains_of_the_Moon&lt;/ref&gt; The book was adapted for film in 1990 by Harrison and director [[Bob Rafelson]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100196/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Although both Burton and Speke were former military officers the expedition they agreed to undertake together was, according to the author, fated to be disastrous for them both, despite their ultimate success. They had no common bond, apart from their military service with the [[British Army]] and their typical British upper class [[Victorian era|Victorian]] upbringing, and were so dissimilar in character and moral beliefs as to be quite incomprehensible to each other.

Within a month of their departure from [[Mombasa]] on the East African coast into the unknown interior of [[Kenya]] the two men were barely speaking. The repressed and racially bigoted Speke felt that Burton was a lackadaisical wastrel, more interested in whoring and passing the time with natives and Arab traders than in the enterprise at hand and Burton believed the [[Dyslexia|dyslexic]] Speke to be stupid and incompetent, unable even to learn how to use simple measuring devices, vital to serious exploration. 
Despite these obvious drawbacks however, it is Speke who eventually discovers [[Lake Victoria]] as the source of the Nile, due to Burton falling seriously ill with [[malaria]] and having to be left behind in an Arab trading camp.

Here their mutual antipathy turns to bitter enmity when Speke, breaking his word to Burton, claims sole credit for the discovery. Unfortunately for Speke his lack of accurate readings and sloppy map making skills lead the scientific world to doubt his word. Speke dies from a self-inflicted gunshot wound shortly before he and Burton were due to take part in a public debate regarding the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/william-harrison-3/burton-and-speke/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation==
''[[Mountains of the Moon (film)|Mountains of the Moon]]'' (1992) was directed by [[Bob Rafelson]] and starred [[Patrick Bergin]] and [[Iain Glen]].

{{demoscene}}
'''Chaos Constructions''' is the oldest [[computer art]] festival originally related to [[demoscene]] subculture, the biggest in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.demoparty.net/chaosconstructions2018/ |title=Chaos Constructions 2018 |publisher=demoparty.net |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been held as a [[demoparty]] since 1995 and was called ''ENLiGHT'' until 1999. Traditionally it is held on a weekend at the end of August at [[Saint Petersburg, Russia]]. Creative competitions for computer artists and musicians, as well as programmers, are the important part of the event. The competitions (''"[[demoscene compo|compo]]s"'') are both for pre-released and real-time works. Many of the compos and exhibits are related to [[retro computing]] ([[ASCII art]], [[pixel art]], [[tracker music]], [[chiptune]] etc), but recent festivals also tend to include conferences and meetings for people from the modern [[IT industry]] who concentrate on technologies such as [[augmented reality|augmented]]/[[virtual reality]], [[blockchain]], [[robotics]] and more.

== History ==
The [[demoscene]] ({{lang-ru|русскоязычная демосцена}}) began to form in [[CIS countries]] in the early 1990s, when people massively began to possess [[home computer]]s such as [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amiga]] and [[Atari]] and make [[tracker music]], demos and other artwork on them. They were exchanging it using [[floppy disks]], [[FIDOnet]] and later the [[Internet]], so that these artists joined the worldwide demoscene culture. By the year 1995, the first Russian [[demoparty]] occurred, located in St. Petersburg—the second-largest Russian city, situated close to [[Finland]], the country with one of the strongest demoscene cultures.

The demoparty was entitled ENLiGHT; it gathered around 150 people. It was followed by ENLiGHT'96 and ENLiGHT'97; the latter gathered more than 1200 people.

The year 1998 was skipped, and the 1999 festival was held in a new format and under the new name ''Chaos Constructions''.

In 2006 the event's format was shifted closer to a [[LAN party]].

The 2017 festival featured an extra event called ''ChaosConf'' which was aimed at developers and admins of [[Enterprise system|enterprise IT systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} https://tjournal.ru/59026-istinnyy-kiberpank-kak-ustroen-festival-demosceny-chaos-constructions&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present day ==

The 2018 festival was held at a [[coworking|co-working location]] called ''Boiling Point'' and also featured "enterprise" and "telecom" sections. There were several thematic areas; the party went for 2 days without breaking at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} https://www.the-village.ru/village/weekend/events/130055-vyhodnye-v-gorode&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twitch.tv]] broadcast it online, and international English-speaking people also participated. The festival's crew also had arranged an "embassy" at a similar earlier gathering called [[Geek Picnic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} https://www.spb.kp.ru/daily/26866/3908980/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Christian music festival''' (also known as a '''Jesus music festival''' or simply a '''Jesus festival''') is a [[music festival]] held by the [[Christian]] community, in support of performers of [[Contemporary Christian music|Christian music]]. The festivals are characterized by more than just music; many feature motivational speakers and evangelists, and include seminars&lt;ref name="CCM_24_12"/&gt; on Christian spiritual and [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] topics, [[Community service|service]], and [[evangelism]]. They are often viewed as evangelical tools, and small festivals can draw 10 times the crowd of traditional [[revival meetings]].&lt;ref name="TampaT_10-26"&gt;{{cite news |first=Martha J. |last=Fry |title=Rock 'N' Roll Revival. |publisher=[[The Tampa Tribune]] |page=4 |date=2002-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the central theme of a Christian festival is [[Jesus Christ]], the core appeal of a Christian music festival remains the artists and their music.&lt;ref name="CYTY_37_14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beaujon_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Apostles_1999"/&gt; Critics point out that the dichotomy of business and religious interests can be problematic for Christian festivals. In similar ways as the [[Christian music industry]] in general, festivals can be drawn away from their central theme and gravitate toward commercialization and mainstream acts in an attempt to draw crowds.&lt;ref name="CCM_24_12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PRISM_8_3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CYTY_47_7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CSTONE_25_108"/&gt;

[[File:Creation Festival from Lookout.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Creation Festival]], 2007]]
Though Christian music festivals had been held prior to it, 1972 is seen as a pivotal year for Christian music due to the [[Explo '72]] event, which was concluded by a massive music festival. Today Christian music festivals are held regularly throughout the United States and around the world. Christian music festivals were often supported by evangelical organizations; this is still true today, however, there are a number of free-standing festivals as well. Christian festivals are sometimes attached as secondary events to youth conferences, revival meetings, or billed as a part of a weekend package at [[theme park]]s. In 1999 the [[Gospel Music Association]] estimated the commercial revenue of Christian music festivals in the United States at approximately $22 million, with a combined attendance of over one-half million people.&lt;ref name="StarT_6-9"/&gt; Christian music festivals continued to grow significantly into the 2000s, with the number of large festivals rising,&lt;ref name="Sandler06"/&gt; and the formation of a [[Christian festival association|representative organization]] for the festivals themselves.

While [[counter-culture]] is generally accepted many attendees dress conservatively, and unlike their mainstream counterparts Christian music festivals are relatively free of [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[Drug abuse|drug use]].&lt;ref name="CYTY_37_14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StarT_6-9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StLouis_Cstone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ATU_6-8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CYTY_37_51"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker1980"/&gt; Even at the Explo '72 festival, which was attended by 150,000 or more people, police reported a trouble free event.&lt;ref name="LIFE_72_25"/&gt;

1972 is seen as a pivotal year for Christian music festivals due to a [[Revival meeting|crusade]] and [[evangelism]] training event called [[Explo '72]], held in [[Dallas, Texas]]. Explo was sponsored by the World Conference on Missions and [[Campus Crusade for Christ]].&lt;ref name="PRISM_8_3"/&gt; The week-long event was attended by 80,000 registered attendees and concluded with a day-long music festival.

Early Christian music festivals were noted for their conservatism, often limiting their [[artistic expression]] to "safe, [[Middle of the road (music)#Contemporary usage|middle-of-the-road]] acts."&lt;ref name="CSTONE_25_108"/&gt; The [[Jesus Festival]], which was founded in 1973, offers a few illustrative incidents. In their inaugural year they hired a promoter, Tim Landis, who brought in acts such as [[2nd Chapter of Acts]], [[Pat Terry (musician)|Pat Terry]], and [[Phil Keaggy]]. The conservative owners, who wanted a [[family oriented]] music festival, found the music "a little too racy" and fired him.&lt;ref name="CCM_24_12"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nentwig |first=Wendy Lee |date=June 2002 |title=GODapalooza |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=42–46 |issn=1524-7848 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year at the same festival, [[Randy Matthews]] was chased off stage by a crowd which pronounced him to be [[Demonic possession|demon]] or [[Drug abuse|drug]] possessed due to his musical style and his announcement of an impending tour with [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] and [[ZZ Top]].&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_RM"&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell |title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music |year=2002 |chapter=Randy Matthews |pages=566–569}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthews was later dropped from the tour roster.

The number and size of Christian music festivals continued to grow alongside the Christian music industry. By the mid 1970s festivals had appeared in all parts of the country.&lt;ref name="Baker1980"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baker |first1=Paul |title=Why Should The Devil Have All The Good Music? |edition=2nd printing |date=December 1980  |origyear=1971 |publisher= |location= |isbn=0-8499-2858-3 |pages=27, 145–153 |chapter=12.

For several years Creation was held at the same venue as the Jesus Festival, the Agape Farm, only a few weeks apart.&lt;ref name="CCM_24_12"/&gt; More specialized festivals appeared to fill [[niche market]]s within the industry. The first completely rock music oriented festival was held in 1981.&lt;ref name="CCM_4_1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Donaldson |first=Devlin |date=July 1981 |title=Illinois Jam: An Oasis in The Midwest |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=51 |issn=1524-7848 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCM_4_4"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Donaldson |first=Devlin |date=October 1981 |title=How Illinois' First Rock Fest Got Into A Jam |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=52–53 |issn=1524-7848 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Called Illinois Jam, it featured artists including [[Barnabas (band)|Barnabas]], [[Servant (band)|Servant]], [[Avion (band)|Randall Waller]], and Randy Stonehill. [[Christian metal]] festivals also emerged, particularly in the late 1980s.

In the 1990s the contemporary Christian music industry experienced explosive growth and saw the establishment of new festivals as well.&lt;ref name="JJT_RBW_2000"/&gt; The most significant of these are Purple Door and [[Tomfest]], the latter of which regularly holds mini-festivals in diverse parts of the country.&lt;ref name="JJT_RBW_2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=John J. |authorlink=John J.

They are often similar in structure to their secular counterparts such as [[Vans Warped Tour]] or [[Lolapalooza]], offering [[extreme sports]] and a carnival-like atmosphere.&lt;ref name="TampaT_10-26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GazCS_6-8"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jen |last=Mulson |title=Godapalooza; Festival fuses Christian music with extreme sports |publisher=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]] |page=GO 14 |date=2001-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 2000s, the attendance at United States festivals grew significantly. According to one source, the number of Christian music festivals attended by more than 5000 youths grew from five in the year 2000 to 35 in 2006.&lt;ref name="Sandler06"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sandler |first=Lauren |title=Righteous: Dispatches from the Evangelical Youth Movement |year=2006 |publisher=[[Penguin Group]] |location=New York |isbn=0-670-03791-5 |chapter=You Will Know Them By Their Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this growth, many US festivals have formed a collective organization, the [[Christian Festival Association]], to represent their interests.

Though the festival offers a number of well-known Christian speakers, and though some of the music groups appeal for a [[Salvation#Christianity|commitment to Jesus]] (there's a counseling area roped off on the hillside), the atmosphere is not intensely religious.

==Theater history==
Biddeford's City Theater originally opened as an opera house in October 1860 at its present Main Street location as a part of the Biddeford City Hall complex. The opera house enjoyed a high level of popularity in the Biddeford and Southern Maine region until burning down December 30, 1894. Whether to rebuild the opera house was debated, the city eventually settled on rebuilding a more structurally sound opera house.&lt;ref name="Biddeford City Theater: History"&gt;[http://citytheater.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=34 Biddeford City Theater: History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Architect John Calvin Stevens was chosen to design the new city hall and opera house, which opened January 20, 1896. The opera house again became a favorite site for cultural and entertainment attractions. Through to the 1920s it brought [[vaudeville]], [[minstrel shows]], illustrated songs, dramatic performances and even community pageants and plays to the Southern Maine community.&lt;ref name="Biddeford City Theater: History"/&gt;

The introduction of [[talkies]] in 1928 began the transition from opera house to movie theater. In 1955, “improvements” to its interior were made, including panelling of the lobby and its staircase and addition poster displays and a [[cinemascope]] screen. The name of the opera house was at this time officially changed to Biddeford's City Theater.&lt;ref name="Biddeford City Theater: History"/&gt;

However, with the increased popularity of [[drive-ins]] and television, City Theater had closed its doors by 1963 and remained closed until 1978. In the interim, Biddeford's City Theater was used as a storage facility for the city and, at one point, a horse-shoe pit, complete with a pile of sand dumped in the orchestra pit. Ironically, also during this period, in 1973 Biddeford's City Theater was added to the National Register of Historical Places.&lt;ref name="Biddeford City Theater: History"/&gt;

In 1977, the newly incorporated City Theater Associates launched a campaign to renovate and re-open the opera house. Thus, a year later, the internationally popular [[Norman Luboff Choir]] opened for Biddeford's City Theater's first performance season in nearly 50 years.&lt;ref name="Biddeford City Theater: History"/&gt;

Though great improvements were made to its interior during the re-opening, City Theater was still in great need of restoration. It was not until the 1990s, when City Theater celebrated its centennial, that the theater received a full restoration. Funding was provided by local, state and federal governments along with private donations from local businesses and individuals. A new marquee, re-stenciling of the lobby and house walls and ceilings and new sound and lighting were among the improvements made.&lt;ref name="Biddeford City Theater: History"/&gt;

==Present day==

Current renovations to Biddeford's City Theater include re-pointing the exterior brickwork and improving the stage floor and restrooms.{{update after|2015|5|2}}

City Theater currently runs a year-round season of theater, music and dance performances. Additionally, the theater has recently added community theater and youth opera and developed an ongoing relationship with the [[University of New England (United States)|University of New England]].&lt;ref name="Biddeford City Theater: History"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2005">'''Clothing scam companies''' are companies or [[gangs]] that purport to be collecting [[Used goods|second-hand]] clothes for [[Charitable organization|charities]] or to be working for charitable causes, when they are in fact working for themselves, giving little if anything to charitable causes. They are a particular problem in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where they rely on people's awareness of proper charities established practise of collecting used clothes for good causes. These companies cause major problems for established charities in terms of lost [[donations]] and making the public distrustful of all clothes collectors.

== Advertising ==

A popular tactic of clothing scam companies is to leaflet a particular area and then move on before people become aware that the company is a clothing scam company. These leaflets will often illegally claim that they are either charities or working for established charities. Often they will state in [[small print]] that they are a commercial company, but will prominently place wording that implies they are, often quoting very vague charitable aims such as 'third world collection' etc.

These companies are very difficult to prosecute as frequently they are not in fact companies at all, quoting fictitious company names or someone else's company name, when in fact they are just a gang of people getting together to resell used-clothes. Many clothing scam companies use casual labour to deliver the leaflets and collect bags of clothing. They are not officially employed by the clothing scam company, which doesn't keep a record of the people they use that can be checked.

The '''Cold Springs Fire''' started July 12, 2008, eleven miles north of [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]] in Washington.  It was contained and put out in August 2008.

The fire was started by lightning on July 12 and spread rapidly through heavy dead timber, eventually burning a total of 7,993 acres before full containment was reached on August 1. Of the area burned, 4,723 acres were in the [[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]], 1,623 on the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]], 1,076 on land managed by the [[Washington Department of Natural Resources]], and 307 on privately owned lands. At the peak of firefighting efforts, over 1,000 personnel were assigned to combat the blaze. In total, 1,037 firefighters from 33 units were needed to reach containment.&lt;ref name=USDA&gt;{{cite web|title=INCIWEB – Cold Spring Fire|url=https://fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsbdev3_005731.pdf|website=USDA|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fire neared [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]] as it spread north of [[Trout Lake, Washington|Trout Lake]] causing closings for several trails and camp grounds.&lt;ref name=Andrew&gt;{{cite web|last1=Engelson|first1=Andrew|title=Fire Closes Trails Near Mount Adams, the state's highest peak |url=http://www.wta.org/signpost/fire-closes-trails-near-mount-adams|website=Washington Trails Association|publisher=Washington Trails Association|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fire officials said it was the largest fire the area had received in decades, and the dangerous fire conditions allowed it to grow and spread quickly through dead trees and winds up to 25&amp;nbsp;mph.

[[File:Tojo2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hideki Tojo]], Japanese Prime Minister at the time of the attack]]
The results of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] were many and significant.

==American public opinion prior to the attack==
Prior to the attack, public opinion in the [[United States]] had not been unanimous. When polled in January 1940, 60% of Americans were in favor of helping the [[United Kingdom]] in the war.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://ibiblio.org/pha/Gallup/Gallup%201941.htm Gallup Polling Data (1940–1941)]&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of Americans believed that the safety of the United States was contingent on the UK winning the war, and an even larger majority believed that the UK would lose the war if the United States stopped sending war materials to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite this, the same poll reported that 88% of Americans would not support entering the war against [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Americans were more unsure on the prospect of conflict with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] around the same timeframe. In a February Gallup poll, a majority of Americans believed that the United States should intervene in Japan's conquest of the Dutch East Indies and Singapore.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in the same poll, only 39% supported going to war with Japan, while 46% opposed the prospect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Public support for assisting the United Kingdom rose through 1940, reaching about 65% by May 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berinsky|first=Adam|date=2007|title=America at War: Public Opinion During Wartime, from World War II to Iraq|url=https://www.princeton.edu/csdp/events/Berinsky101107/BerinskyManuscript101107.pdf|journal=University of Chicago Press|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, opinions on the prospect of becoming involved against Germany and Italy still remained quite high with 80% disapproval.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==American response==
[[File:Franklin Roosevelt signing declaration of war against Japan.jpg|thumb|200px|President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signing the Declaration of War against Japan on the day following the attack]]
On December 7, 1941, the Japanese launched a surprise attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor. After two hours of bombing, 18 U.S. ships were sunk or damaged, 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed, and 2,403 men were killed.

The day after the attack, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] addressed a joint session of the [[77th United States Congress]]. Roosevelt called December 7 [[Infamy Speech|"a date which will live in infamy"]]. Congress [[United States declaration of war upon Japan|declared war on the Empire of Japan]] amid outrage at the attack, the deaths of thousands of Americans, and the late delivery of the note from the Japanese government breaking off relations with the U.S. government. [[Pacifist]] [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Jeannette Rankin]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[Montana]], cast the only dissenting vote. Roosevelt signed the declaration of war later the same day. Continuing to intensify its military mobilization, the U.S. government finished converting to a [[war economy]], a process begun by [[Lend-Lease|provision of weapons and supplies]] to the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[British Empire]]. Japanese Americans from the West Coast were sent to internment camps for the duration of the war.

The attack on Pearl Harbor immediately galvanized a divided nation into action. Public opinion had been moving towards support for entering the war during 1941, but considerable opposition remained until the attack. Overnight, Americans united against the Empire of Japan in response to calls to "[[Pearl Harbor Survivors Association|Remember Pearl Harbor]]." A poll taken between December 12–17, 1941, showed that 97% of respondents supported a declaration of war against Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/vault/199049/gallup-vault-country-unified-pearl-harbor.aspx|title=Gallup Vault: A Country Unified After Pearl Harbor|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further polling showed a dramatic increase in support for every able-bodied man serving in the military, up to 70% in December 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berinsky|first=Adam|last2=Yohai|first2=Ian|last3=Powell|first3=Eleanor|last4=Schickler|first4=Eric|date=July 2011|title=Revisiting Public Opinion in the 1930’s and 1940’s|url=http://web.mit.edu/berinsky/www/files/3040.pdf|journal=PS: Political Science and Politics|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; American solidarity in the war effort probably made possible the [[unconditional surrender]] position later taken by the Allied Powers. Some historians, among them [[Samuel Eliot Morison]], believe the attack doomed Imperial Japan to defeat simply because it awakened the "sleeping giant", regardless of whether the fuel depots or machine shops had been destroyed or even if the carriers had been caught in port and sunk. U.S. industrial and military capacity, once mobilized, was able to pour overwhelming resources into both the Pacific and Atlantic theaters. Others, such as Clay Blair, Jr.,&lt;ref&gt;''Silent Victory'' (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Parillo&lt;ref&gt;''The Japanese Merchant Marine in World War II'' (Annapolis: United States Naval Institute Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; believe Japanese [[Convoy|trade protection]] was so incompetent that American submarines alone might have strangled Japan into defeat.

The closest friend Roosevelt had in the developing Allied alliance, Sir [[Winston Churchill]], stated that his first thought regarding American assistance to the United Kingdom was that "We have won the war"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stokesbury|first=James L.|title=A Short History of WWII|publisher=William Morrow and Company, Inc.|year=1980|location=New York|page=171|isbn=0-688-03587-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; very soon after Pearl Harbor had been attacked.

Perceptions of treachery in the attack before a declaration of war sparked fears of [[Fifth column|sabotage]] or [[List of Japanese spies, 1930-45|espionage by Japanese sympathizers]] residing in the U.S., including [[Japanese Americans|citizens of Japanese descent]], and was a factor in the subsequent [[Japanese internment in the United States|Japanese internment]] in the western United States. Other factors included misrepresentations of intelligence information suggesting sabotage, notably by [[John L. DeWitt|General John DeWitt]], commanding general of [[Western Defense Command]] on the Pacific Coast, who had personal feelings against Japanese Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of John L. DeWitt, 13 April 1943, House Naval Affairs Subcommittee to Investigate Congested Areas, Part 3, pp. 739–40 (78th Cong., 1st Sess.), cited in [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=323&amp;invol=214#fff2 ''Korematsu v. United States''], footnote 2, reproduced at findlaw.com, accessed 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1942, Roosevelt signed [[United States Executive Order 9066]], requiring all Japanese Americans to submit themselves for internment.

[[American propaganda during World War II|Propaganda]] made repeated use of the attack, because its effect was enormous and impossible to counter.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Rhodes, ''Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II'', p257 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York&lt;/ref&gt; "Remember Pearl Harbor!" became the watchwords of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Gordon (historian)|Andrew Gordon]], ''A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa to the Present'', p210, {{ISBN|0-19-511060-9}}. {{OCLC|49704795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American government understated the damage inflicted, in hopes of preventing the Japanese from learning it, but the Japanese had, through surveillance, a good estimate.&lt;ref name="Kennett"&gt;Lee Kennett, ''For the Duration.. . : The United States Goes To War'' p 141 {{ISBN|0-684-18239-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japanese views==
[[File:9 Gunshin.jpg|thumb|left|215px|Japanese heroic depiction of nine submarine crewmembers lost during the attack, excluding the POW, [[Kazuo Sakamaki]]]]
On December 8, 1941, [[Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the British Empire|Japan declared war on the United States and the British Empire]]. The Japanese document discussed [[world peace]] and the disruptive actions of the United States and the United Kingdom. The document claimed all avenues for averting war had been exhausted by the Government of Japan.

Although the Imperial Japanese government had made some effort to prepare their population for war ''via'' anti-U.S. propaganda, it appears most Japanese were surprised, apprehensive, and dismayed by the news they were now at war with the U.S., a country many of them admired. Nevertheless, the people at home and overseas thereafter generally accepted their government's account of the attack and supported the war effort until their nation's surrender in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Guillain, ''I saw Tokyo burning: An eyewitness narrative from Pearl Harbor to Hiroshima'' (J. Murray, 1981). {{ISBN|0-7195-3862-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan's national leadership at the time appeared to have believed war between the U.S. and Japan had long been inevitable. In any case, Japanese-American relationships had already significantly deteriorated since Japan's invasion of China beginning in the early 1930s, of which the United States strongly disapproved. In 1942, [[Saburō Kurusu]], former Japanese ambassador to the United States, gave an address in which he talked about the "historical inevitability of the war of Greater East Asia."&lt;ref name="ibiblio.org"&gt;[[Saburō Kurusu]], [http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1942/421126a.html Historical inevitability of the war of Greater East Asia], Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service, Tokyo, November 26, 1942 (accessed June 10, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; He said war had been a response to Washington's longstanding aggression toward Japan. For example, in his view provocations against Japan included the [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907|San Francisco School incident]], Naval Limitations Treaty, other [[unequal treaties]], the [[Nine Power Pact]], constant economic pressure against Japan, culminating in the "belligerent" [[scrap metal]] and oil embargo in 1941 by the United States and Allied countries to contain and/or reverse the actions of the Empire of Japan especially in Indochina during her expansion of influence and interests throughout Asia.

In light of Japan's dependence on imported oil, the trade embargoes were especially significant. These pressures directly influenced Japan to go into alliance with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Italian fascism|Italy]] through the [[Tripartite Pact]]. According to Kurusu, because of these reasons, the Allies had already provoked war with Japan long before the attack at Pearl Harbor, and the United States was already preparing for war with Japan. Kurusu also stated, falsely, that the United States was looking for world domination, beyond just Asia, with "sinister designs".&lt;ref name="ibiblio.org"/&gt; Some of this view seems to have been shared by [[Adolf Hitler]], when he called it one of the reasons Germany declared war on the United States. He also had mentioned European imperialism toward Japan many years before. Therefore, according to Kurusu, Japan had no choice but to defend itself and so should rapidly continue to militarize, bring Germany and Italy closer as allies and militarily combat the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands.

Japan's leaders also saw themselves as justified in their conduct, believing that they were building the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. They also explained Japan had done everything possible to alleviate tension between the two nations. The decision to attack, at least for public presentation, was reluctant and forced on Japan. Of the Pearl Harbor attack itself, Kurusu said it came in direct response to a virtual ultimatum from the U.S. government, the [[Hull note]], and so the surprise attack was not treacherous. Since the Japanese-American relationship already had hit its lowest point, there was no alternative; in any case, had an acceptable settlement of differences been reached, the [[Carrier Striking Task Force]] could have been called back.

On December 11, 1941, [[German declaration of war against the United States|Nazi Germany]] and [[Italian declaration of war on the United States|Fascist Italy]] declared war on the United States, and the United States reciprocated, formally entering the [[European Theatre of World War II|war in Europe]].

German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] and Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] were under no obligation to declare war on the United States under the mutual defense terms of the [[Tripartite Pact]] until the US counterattacked Japan. However, relations between the European Axis Powers and the United States had deteriorated since 1937. On December 4, 1941, the Germans learned of the U.S. military's contingency planning to get troops in Continental Europe by 1943; this was [[Rainbow Five]], made public by sources unsympathetic to Roosevelt's [[New Deal]], and published by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ariwatch.com/Links/RainbowFive.htm |title=The Big Leak |last=Fleming |first=Thomas |date=December 1987 |website=ariwatch.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214190026/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1987/8/1987_8_64.shtml |archive-date=February 14, 2008 |publisher=ARI Watch |access-date=December 12, 2016 |quote=Blazoned in huge black letters across page one of the December 4, 1941, issue of the Chicago Tribune was the headline: F.D.R.’S WAR PLANS! The Times Herald, the Tribune’s Washington, D.C. ally, carried a similarly fevered banner. In both papers Chesly Manly, the Tribunes Washington correspondent, revealed what President Franklin D. Roosevelt had repeatedly denied: that he was planning to lead the United States into war against Germany. The source of the reporter’s information was no less than a verbatim copy of Rainbow Five, the top-secret war plan drawn up at FDR’s order by the Joint Board of the Army and Navy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, with Roosevelt's initiation of a [[Neutrality Patrol]], which in fact also escorted British ships, as well as orders to U.S. Navy [[destroyer]]s first to actively report [[German submarine|U-boats]], then "shoot on sight", American neutrality was honored more in the breach than observance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/timeline/pearl.htm The History Place]&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been unaware of Japanese plans, Hitler was initially furious that the United States had been dragged into the war at a time when he had not yet acquired full control of continental Europe — on the very day of the Pearl Harbor attack, Hitler himself had issued his [[Nacht und Nebel]] decree, concerning the suppression of resistance activities within Nazi-occupied lands. Hitler, who had previously declared the Japanese "[[Honorary Aryan]]s" claimed that "this is what happens when your allies are not [[Anglo-Saxons]]".&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hitler http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERhitler.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} However, he decided war with the United States was unavoidable, and the Pearl Harbor attack, the publication of [[United States color-coded war plans#Rainbow plans|Rainbow Five]], and Roosevelt's post-Pearl Harbor address, which focused on European affairs as well as the situation with Japan, probably contributed to the declaration. Hitler expected the United States would soon declare war on Germany in any event.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian. ''Fateful Choices: Ten Decisions the Changed the World, 1940–1941'' New York: Penguin, 2007. pp.444–46 {{ISBN|978-1-59420-123-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He disastrously underestimated American military production capacity, the United States' own ability to fight on two fronts, and the time his own [[Operation Barbarossa]] would require. Similarly, the Nazis may have hoped the declaration of war, a showing of solidarity with Japan, would result in closer collaboration with the Japanese in Eurasia, particularly against the Soviet Union — something that would not materialize, due to existing [[Japan-Soviet Union relations#1932–1945: Deteriorating relations and war|relations between Moscow and Tokyo at that time]], as well as information submitted in mid-September 1941 by the Soviets' top spy in Japan, [[Richard Sorge]], that the Japanese armed forces were not likely to abrogate any treaties between Japan and the Soviets unless:
# Moscow had been captured by the Axis

==Churchill reaction==
The war had been going poorly for the [[British Empire]] for more than two years, and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] was deeply concerned about the future. On December 7, he was at his country estate, [[Chequers]], with a few friends and his family. At dinner he seemed depressed, holding his face in his hands for minutes at a time {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. Just after dinner he heard of the attack. Churchill immediately, and correctly, surmised the consequences of the attack for the course of the war. 
{{Quote

==Canadian response==
Following the Japanese attack on the Americans, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], the Prime Minister of the Dominion of Canada advised [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]], [[Monarchy of Canada|King of Canada]], that a state of war should exist between Canada and Japan, and the King accordingly issued this proclamation on December 8:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas by and with the advice of our [[Privy Council for Canada]] we have signified our approval of the issue of a proclamation in the ''[[Canada Gazette]]'' declaring that a state of war with Japan exists and has existed in Canada as and from the 7th day of December 1941.

Now, therefore, we do hereby declare and proclaim that a state of war with Japan exists and has existed as and from the seventh day of December 1941.

Of all which our loving subjects and all others whom these presents may concern are hereby required to take notice and to govern themselves accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/timeline/411208bwp.html|title=CANADA DECLARES WAR ON JAPAN|accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Canada remained focused on the [[European theatre of World War II|European theatre]], like the United States, and following [[VE Day]] was still in the process of transitioning its military force for a campaign in east Asia and the western Pacific when [[VJ Day]] arrived.

==Investigations and blame==
President Roosevelt appointed the [[Roberts Commission]], headed by U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Owen Josephus Roberts|Owen Roberts]], to investigate and report facts and findings with respect to the attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the first of many official investigations (nine in all). Both the Fleet commander, Rear Admiral [[Husband E. Kimmel]], and the Army commander, Lieutenant General [[Walter Short]] (the Army had been responsible for air defense of Hawaii, including Pearl Harbor, and for general defense of the islands against hostile attack), were relieved of their commands shortly thereafter. They were accused of "dereliction of duty" by the Roberts Commission for not making reasonable defensive preparations. None of the investigations conducted during the War, nor the Congressional investigation afterward, provided enough reason to reverse those actions. The decisions of the Navy and War Departments to relieve both was controversial at the time and has remained so. However, neither was court-martialed as would normally have been the result of dereliction of duty. On May 25, 1999, the U.S. Senate voted to recommend both officers be exonerated on all charges, citing "denial to Hawaii commanders of vital intelligence available in Washington".

A Joint Congressional Committee was also appointed, on September 14, 1945, to investigate the causes of the attack and subsequent disaster, and was convened on November 15, 1945.&lt;ref name=Jessup&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jessup |first1=John E. |title=A Chronology of Conflict and Resolution, 1945–1985  |year=1989  |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=New York  |isbn=0-313-24308-5  |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise of anti-Japanese sentiment and historical significance==

{{See also|Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States|In Defense of Internment|List of Japanese spies, 1930–45|Niihau Incident}}

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor coupled with their alliance with the Nazis and the ensuing war in the Pacific fueled [[anti-Japanese sentiment]], racism, [[xenophobia]], and anti-[[Axis powers|Axis]] sentiment in the Allied nations like never before. Japanese, Japanese-Americans and Asians having a similar physical appearance were regarded with deep seated suspicion, distrust and hostility. The attack was viewed as having been conducted in an extremely underhanded way and also as a very "treacherous" or "sneaky attack". Suspicions were further fueled by the ''Niihau Incident'', as historian [[Gordon Prange]] stated "the rapidity with which the three resident Japanese went over to the pilot's cause" which troubled the Hawaiians. "The more pessimistic among them cited the [[Niihau Incident]] as proof that no one could trust any Japanese, even if an American citizen, not to go over to Japan if it appeared expedient."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Prange | first = Gordon W | authorlink = Gordon Prange | year = 1962 | title = December 7, 1941: The Day the Japanese Attacked Pearl Harbor | publisher = McGraw Hill | location = New York | pages=375–377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack, the subsequent declarations of war, and fear of "[[Fifth Column]]ists" resulted in internment of Japanese, German, and Italian populations in the United States and others, for instance the [[Japanese American internment]], [[German American internment]], [[Italian American internment]], and [[Japanese Canadian internment]]. The attack resulted in the United States fighting the Germans and Italians among others in Europe and Japan in the Pacific.

The consequences were world-changing. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] knew that the survival of the British Empire depended on American aid, and since 1940 had frequently asked Roosevelt to declare war. Churchill aide [[Jock Colville|John Colville]] stated that the prime minister and [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|American Ambassador]] [[John Gilbert Winant]], who also supported the British, "sort of danced around the room together" as the United States would now enter the war, making a British victory likely.&lt;ref name="olson2010"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Citizens of London: The Americans Who Stood With Britain In Its Darkest, Finest Hour |last=Olson, Lynne |publisher=Random House |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-58836-982-6 |pages=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill later wrote, "Being saturated and satiated with emotion and sensation, I went to bed and slept the sleep of the saved and thankful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Winston| last=Churchill| title=The Second World War, Vol. 3| pages=539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By opening the [[Pacific War]], which ended in the unconditional surrender of Japan, the attack on Pearl Harbor led to the breaking of an Asian check on Soviet expansion. The Allied victory in this war and the subsequent U.S. emergence as a dominant world power, eclipsing Britain, have shaped international politics ever since.

Pearl Harbor is generally regarded as an extraordinary event in American history, remembered as the first time since the [[War of 1812]] that America was attacked in strength on its territory by another country – with only the [[September 11 attacks]] almost 60 years later being of a similarly catastrophic scale. It was the first decisive defeat for the United States in World War II. It has become synonymous with "surprise attack" ever since in American parlance. The U.S. mistakes of intelligence collection, sharing, and analysis leading to the Japanese success at Pearl Harbor did not, in the end, lead to lessons learned.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes-Wilson, ''Military Intelligence Blunders &amp; Cover-Ups'' (Harper Collins, 2001). Clausen suggests that creation of the CIA solved the problem; the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] demonstrate this is far from certain.&lt;/ref&gt;{{vague|date=June 2018}}

==Perception of the attack today==
Some Japanese today feel they were compelled to fight because of threats to their national interests and an [[embargo]] imposed by the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The most important embargo was on oil on which its Navy and much of the economy was dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Haruko Taya &amp; Theodore F. Cook, ''Japan at War: An Oral History'' (New Press; Reprint edition, 1993). {{ISBN|1-56584-039-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[Japan Times]]'', an English-language newspaper owned by one of the major news organizations in Japan (Asahi Shimbun), ran numerous columns in the early 2000s echoing Kurusu's comments in reference to the Pearl Harbor attack.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Burress, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?eo20010719a2.htm Biased history helps feed U.S. fascination with Pearl Harbor]", ''Japan Times'', July 19, 2001 (accessed June 10, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In putting the Pearl Harbor attack into context, Japanese writers repeatedly contrast the thousands of U.S. non-combatants killed there with the hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians killed in [[Air raids on Japan|U.S. air attacks on Japan]] later in the war, even without mentioning the 1945 [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] by the United States.

However, in spite of the perceived inevitability of the war by many Japanese, many also believe the Pearl Harbor attack, although a tactical victory, was actually part of a seriously flawed strategy for engaging in war with the U.S. As one columnist wrote, "The Pearl Harbor attack was a brilliant tactic, but part of a strategy based on the belief that a spirit as firm as iron and as beautiful as cherry blossoms could overcome the materially wealthy United States. That strategy was flawed, and Japan's total defeat would follow."&lt;ref&gt;Burritt Sabin, [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?fl20040208x3.htm "The War's Leagacy &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;: Dawn of a tragic era"], ''Japan Times'', February 8, 2004 (accessed June 10, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1991, the Japanese Foreign Ministry released a statement saying Japan had intended to make a formal declaration of war to the United States at 1&amp;nbsp;p.m. Washington time, 25 minutes before the attack at Pearl Harbor was scheduled to begin. This officially acknowledged something that had been publicly known for years. Diplomatic communications had been coordinated well in advance with the attack, but had failed delivery at the intended time. It appears the Japanese government was referring to the "14-part message", which did not actually break off negotiations, let alone declare war, but did officially raise the possibility of a break in relations. However, because of various delays, the Japanese ambassador was unable to deliver this message until well after the attack had begun.

Imperial Japanese military leaders appear to have had mixed feelings about the attack. [[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Navy)|Fleet Admiral]] [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] was unhappy about the botched timing of the breaking off of negotiations. He is on record as having said, in the previous year, "I can run wild for six months ... after that, I have no expectation of success."&lt;ref&gt;Isoroku Yamamoto to Shigeharu Matsumoto (Japanese cabinet minister) and Fumimaro Kondoye (Japanese prime minister), quoted in [[Ronald Spector]], ''Eagle Against the Sun: The American War With Japan'' (Vintage, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; The reports of American reactions, terming it a "sneak attack" and "infamous behavior", confirmed that the effect on American morale had been the opposite of intended.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin P. Hoyt]], ''Japan's War'', p 232 {{ISBN|0-07-030612-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prime Minister of Japan]] during World War II, [[Hideki Tōjō]] later wrote, "When reflecting upon it today, that the Pearl Harbor attack should have succeeded in achieving surprise seems a blessing from Heaven."{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Yamamoto had said,{{when|date=June 2018}} regarding the imminent war with the United States, "Should hostilities once break out between Japan and the United States, it is not enough that we take [[Guam]] and [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|the Philippines]], nor even [[Territory of Hawaii|Hawaii]] and San Francisco. We would have to march into Washington and sign the treaty in the [[White House]]. I wonder if our politicians (who speak so lightly of a Japanese-American war) have confidence as to the outcome and are prepared to make the necessary sacrifices?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://plasma.nationalgeographic.com/pearlharbor/ngbeyond/people/people11.html  National Geographic mini-biography of Isoroku Yamamoto]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revisionism controversies===
[[File:Yasukuni Yusyukan.jpg|right|thumb|Some exhibits of Yasukuni Yusyukan have been criticised because of justification of Attack on Pearl Harbor]]
There are some [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionists]] in Japan who claim that the Attack on Pearl Harbor was a legitimate attack. These historical perspectives are often claimed by Japanese [[Shintoist]] and [[nationalist]]s and have been criticized from both inside and outside Japan.
* An exhibit at the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] Museum ([[Yūshūkan]]) asserts that the attack on Pearl Harbor was a trick by U.S. President [[Franklin D.

* In 2006, [[Henry Hyde]], chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, sent a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert on April 26 to show concern about [[Junichiro Koizumi]] visits to Yasukuni Shrine. He pointed out that this Shrine honors [[Hideki Tōjō]] and other convicted Class-A war criminals who were involved in the Pearl Harbor attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20060517a1.html |title=Bid to address Congress has Yasukuni proviso |accessdate=2011-11-23 |date=2006-05-17 |work=[[The Japan Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 2007, the Japan [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education]] distributed an animated DVD ''[[Hokori]]'' (Pride) which was created by [[Junior Chamber International Japan]] (JC). [[Japanese Communist Party]] Diet member [[Yuko Ishii]] introduced and criticized it to the [[House of Representatives of Japan]] in May 17, and revealed that its contents glamorized Class-A war criminals and had the main character Yuta tell his girlfriend Kokoro that the battle was a "self-defense attack" and "Asian colonial liberation" against [[American imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcp.or.jp/akahata/aik07/2007-05-18/2007051803_01_0.html |title=Brainwashing for justification – Ministry of Education deploying "Yasukuni DVD" – |accessdate=2011-11-23 |date=2007-05-18 |work=[[Shimbun Akahata]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On October 31, 2008, [[Toshio Tamogami]], former chief of staff of Japan's [[Air Self-Defense Force]], published an essay which argued that [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who had allegedly been manipulated by the [[Comintern]], drew Japan into the attack on Pearl Harbor. Following the essay's publication, Defense Minister [[Yasukazu Hamada]] removed Tamogami from his post and ordered him to retire, since the essay's viewpoint contradicted the government position.&lt;ref&gt;Hongo, Jun, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081108a1.html New ASDF chief Hokazono sorry for Tamogami's 'damaging' essay]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 8 November 2008, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hongo, Jun, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081226a5.html Tamogami's cohorts reprimanded]", [[Japan Times]]'', 26 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Tamogami, on November 3, 2008, confirmed that the essay accurately expressed his views on the war and Japan's role in it.&lt;ref&gt;Onishi, Norimitsu, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/world/asia/05briefs-NEWFALLOUTFR_BRF.html Japan: New Fallout From Essay On War]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 5, 2008, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

While not specifically directed at revisionism, but more as a likely result of Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]]'s controversial visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], where some [[Yasukuni Shrine#Post-war issues and controversies|1,600 war criminals were enshrined after their executions]], by February 2015 some concern within the [[Imperial House of Japan]] — which normally does not issue such statements — over the issue was voiced by [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Crown Prince Naruhito]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/japanese-experiments-u-s-pows-exhibit-shows-brutal-history-n338231 |title=Japan's Experiments on U.S. POWs: Exhibit Highlights Horrific History |last=Yamamoto |first=Arata |date=April 9, 2015 |website=nbcnews.com |publisher=NBC News |access-date=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naruhito stated on his 55th birthday (February 23, 2015) that it was "important to look back on the past humbly and correctly", in reference to Japan's role in World War II-era war crimes, and that he was concerned about the ongoing need to "correctly pass down tragic experiences and the history behind Japan to the generations who have no direct knowledge of the war, at the time memories of the war are about to fade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/world-war-ii-should-not-be-forgotten-japans-prince-naruhito-n311561 |title=World War II Should Not Be Forgotten, Japan's Prince Naruhito Says |last=Itasaka |first=Kiko |date=February 24, 2015 |website=nbcnews.com |publisher=NBC News |access-date=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
[[File:Remember december 7th.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Posters like Allen Saalberg's strengthened American resolve against the Axis powers]]

===Tactical implications===
The attack was notable for its considerable destruction, as putting most of the U.S. battleships out of commission was regarded—in both navies and by most military observers worldwide—as a tremendous success for Japan. Influenced by the earlier [[Battle of Taranto]], which pioneered the all-aircraft naval attack but resulted in far less damage and casualties, the Japanese struck against Pearl Harbor on a much larger scale than did the British at Taranto.&lt;ref&gt;"The Dorn report did not state with certainty that Kimmel and Short knew about Taranto. There is, however, no doubt that they did know, as did the Japanese. Lt. Cdr. Takeshi Naito, the assistance naval attaché to Berlin, flew to Taranto to investigate the attack first hand, and Naito subsequently had a lengthy conversation with Cdr. [[Mitsuo Fuchida]] about his observations. Fuchida led the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941." ''Kimmel, Short, and Pearl Harbor: The Final Report Revealed.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack was a great shock to all the Allies in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]], and it was initially believed Pearl Harbor changed the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]], similar to how Taranto did the [[Battle of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]], both in the attackers' favor. Three days later, with the [[sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'']] off the coast of [[British Malaya|Malaya]], British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] exclaimed, "In all the war I never received a more direct shock. As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me. There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California. Over this vast expanse of waters Japan was supreme and we everywhere were weak and naked."&lt;ref name="forcez-survivors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forcez-survivors.org.uk/|title=Welcome to the website of the Force Z Survivors Association|publisher=forcez-survivors.org.uk|accessdate=2014-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Pearl Harbor did not have as crippling an effect on American operations as initially thought. Unlike the close confines of the [[Battle of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]], the vast expanses of the Pacific limited the tactical value of battleships as a [[fleet in being]]. Furthermore, unlike new [[fast battleship]]s such as the {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship|4}}, the slow battleships were incapable of operating with carrier task forces, so once repaired they were relegated to delivering pre-invasion bombardments during the [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]] offensive against Japanese-held islands. These Pearl Harbor veterans were later part of a force that defeated IJN battleships at the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#The Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October)|Battle of Surigao Strait]], an engagement very lopsided in the USN's favor in any case.&lt;ref name="Morison1956"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Leyte, June 1944 – January 1945 |title=[[History of United States Naval Operations in World War II]] |volume=XII |last=Morison |first=Samuel E. |authorlink= |year=1956 |publisher=Little &amp; Brown |location=Boston |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard1999"&gt;Howard (1999). &lt;!-- What title is that? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be between battleships of both sides, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain [[Alfred Mahan]]. Seeing the decimation of battleships at the hands of aircraft, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded his battleships for a "decisive battle" that never happened, only committing a handful to the forefront of the Battles of [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] and [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal]].

One of the main Japanese objectives was to destroy the three American [[aircraft carrier]]s stationed in the Pacific, but they were not present: {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}} was returning from Wake, {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}} from Midway, and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}} was under refit at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]]. Had Japan sunk the American carriers, the U.S. would have sustained significant damage to the Pacific Fleet's ability to conduct offensive operations for a year or so (given no further diversions from the Atlantic Fleet). As it was, the elimination of the battleships left the U.S. Navy with no choice but to place its faith in aircraft carriers and submarines—particularly the large numbers under construction of the U.S. Navy's [[Essex-class aircraft carrier]]s, [[Essex-class aircraft carrier#Ships in class|eleven of which]] had been ordered before the attack—the very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance.

Despite the perception of this battle as a devastating blow to America, only three ships were permanently lost to the U.S. Navy. These were the battleships {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|2}}, {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|2}}, and the old battleship {{USS|Utah|BB-31|2}} (then used as a target ship); nevertheless, much usable material was salvaged from them, including the two aft main turrets from ''Arizona''. The majority of each battleship's crews survived; there were exceptions as heavy casualties resulted from ''Arizona''{{'s}} magazine exploding and the ''Oklahoma'' capsizing. Four ships sunk during the attack were later raised and returned to duty, including the battleships {{USS|California|BB-44|2}}, {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}} and {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|2}}. ''California'' and ''West Virginia'' had an effective torpedo-defense system which held up remarkably well, despite the weight of fire they had to endure, resulting in most of their crews being saved. {{USS|Maryland|BB-46|2}} and {{USS|Tennessee|BB-43|2}} suffered relatively light damage, as did {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}}, which was in drydock at the time.

[[Chester Nimitz]] said later, "It was God's mercy that our fleet was in Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941." Nimitz believed if Kimmel had discovered the Japanese approach to Pearl Harbor, he would have sortied to meet them. With the American carriers absent and Kimmel's battleships at a severe disadvantage to the Japanese carriers, the likely result would have been the sinking of the American battleships at sea in deep water, where they would have been lost forever with tremendous casualties (up to twenty thousand dead), instead of in Pearl Harbor, where the crews could easily be rescued, and six battleships ultimately restored to duty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Prange|Prange, Gordon]], ''Miracle at Midway'', 1983, paperback, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the reaction of [[Joseph Rochefort]], head of [[Station HYPO|&lt;small&gt;HYPO&lt;/small&gt;]], when he remarked the attack was cheap at the price.

Many of the surviving battleships were extensively refitted, including the replacement of their outdated secondary battery of anti-surface [[5"/51 caliber gun]]s with more useful turreted dual-purpose [[5"/38 caliber gun]]s, allowing them to better cope with the new tactical reality.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, their rate of fire was too low to deal with aircraft, as experience with ''[[kamikaze]]'' would demonstrate. Not until the introduction of a fully automatic 3 inch {76 mm} postwar was a suitable solution found.&lt;/ref&gt; Addition of modern [[radar]] to the salvaged vessels would give them a marked qualitative advantage over those of the IJN.&lt;ref name="Morison1956" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard1999" /&gt;

The repaired U.S. battleships primarily provided fire support for amphibious landings. Their low speed was a liability to their deployment in the vast expanses of the [[Pacific War|Pacific]], for instance they could not accompany the fleet carriers that had become the dominant combatants. Six of the Standard Type vessels participated in the last battleship versus battleship engagement in naval history, the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]], where none of them were hit. During active duty, being well protected by escorts and air cover, none of the Pearl Harbor battleships suffered serious damage save for [[USS Pennsylvania (BB-38)#1945|''Pennsylvania'']] which was permanently crippled by a torpedo in the closing stages of the war; on September 2, 1945, ''West Virginia'' was among the [[List of Allied ships at the Japanese surrender|Allied fleet in Tokyo Bay]] when the Japanese [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|officially surrendered]].

====Carriers====
The attack on Pearl Harbor failed to sight, or destroy, any of the Pacific Fleet's three aircraft carriers; they had been designated as primary targets along with the battleships.&lt;ref name="IJN97"&gt;[http://ibiblio.org/pha/monos/097/index.html Japanese Monograph Number 97] Pearl Harbor operation Prepared by Military History Section Headquarters, Army Forces Far East from ibiblio.org/pha.&lt;/ref&gt; The carriers ''Lexington'' and ''Enterprise'' were ferrying additional fighters to American bases on the islands of [[Wake Island|Wake]] and [[Midway Island|Midway]] while ''Saratoga'' was under refit at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Holmes, ''The World Atlas of Warfare: Military Innovations that Changed the Course of History'' (Viking, 1988), p.211.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the Japanese attack, the US was expecting imminent war with Japan, beginning in any of several places, such as the Philippines or Allied bases in Borneo.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_272337_on_20081227171108"&gt;[http://ibiblio.org/pha/timeline/411127acno.html War warning, dated 27 November 1941] The involvement of numerous units of the Japanese Army and the apparent disposition of IJN forces suggested amphibious operations against either the Philippines, the Kra Peninsula, or possibly Borneo, which was the reason warning cables had been sent to all Pacific commands by both the Navy and War Departments at Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;
Nagumo's hesitation, and failure to find and destroy the American carriers, may have been a product of his lack of faith in the attack plan, and of the fact he was a gunnery officer, not an aviator. In addition, Yamamoto's targeting priorities, placing battleships first in importance, reflected an out-of-date [[Alfred Mahan|Mahanian]] [[doctrine]], and an inability to extrapolate from history, given the damage German submarines did to British trade in World War I. In the end, Japan achieved surprisingly little for all her daring and apparent success.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott, ''op. cit.''; Peattie and Evans, ''op. cit.''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shore installations====
Tank farms, containing 140&amp;nbsp;million U.S. gallons (530&amp;nbsp;million liters) of bunker oil, were unscathed, providing a ready source of fuel for American fleets at the submarine base. About this missed opportunity, Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]] would later say, "Had the Japanese destroyed the oil, it would have prolonged the war another two years."&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Yergin|Yergin, Daniel]], ''[[The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power]]'', (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1991) pp.326–327.]&lt;/ref&gt; These were vital to the initial phase of the war, and to commerce raiding throughout, and illustrate the deficiencies of Japanese planning for the attack. The Navy Yard, critical to ship maintenance, and repair of ships damaged in the attack was untouched. The engineering and initial repair shops, as well as the torpedo store, &lt;!-- don't correct this. "store" is proper usage--&gt; were intact. Other items of base infrastructure and operation, such as power generation, continued to operate normally. Also critical to the way the Pacific War was actually fought was the cryptanalysis unit, [[Station Hypo|Station &lt;small&gt;HYPO&lt;/small&gt;]], located in the basement of the old Administration Building. It was undamaged and even benefited by gaining staff from unemployed ship's bands.&lt;ref&gt;Willmott, H.P. (1983), ''The Barrier and the Javelin: Japanese and Allied Pacific Strategies, February to June 1942'', Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, {{ISBN|0-87021-092-0}} ; Blair, ''op. cit.''; Beach, ''Submarine!''; Holmes, ''Double-Edged Secrets'' and ''Undersea Victory''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Army Air Force's loss of aircraft must be balanced against the fact that many of them were obsolete, such as the P-40's predecessor, the [[Curtiss P-36|P-36]]. Japan might have achieved a good deal more with not much additional effort or loss.&lt;ref&gt;Caidin, ''op. cit.'' and ''Fork-Tailed Devil'' (Ballantine, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 22 Japanese ships that took part in the attack, only one survived the war. As of 2006, the only U.S. ships in Pearl Harbor during the attack still remaining afloat are the [[USCGC Taney (WHEC-37)|Coast Guard Cutter ''Taney'']] and the yard tug {{ship||Hoga|YT-146|6}}. Both remained active over 50 years after the attack and have been designated museum ships.

===Strategic implications===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
A common view is that the Japanese fell victim to [[victory disease]] because of the perceived ease of their first victories. It has also been stated by the Japanese military commanders and politicians who visited and lived in the United States, that their leadership (mostly military personnel) took the war with the United States relatively lightly, compared to them. For instance, Admiral Yamamoto and General [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]] expressed concerns about the greater industrial power of the United States.

The politics of a "Europe First" strategy, loss of air cover over Pearl Harbor, and subsequent [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|loss of the Philippines]], meant the U.S. Army and Army Air Forces&lt;ref&gt;[[1941 in aviation#June]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2017|reason=Wikipedia articles are not reliable sources, WP:CIRC|certain=yes}} were unable to play a significant role in the [[Pacific War]] for several months. Japan was temporarily free of worries about the major rival Pacific naval power, which was at least part of the intention for the attack. Because Australian, New Zealand, Dutch and most British forces were already in Europe, Japan conquered nearly all of Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific, and extended her reach far into the [[Indian Ocean]], without significant interference. The various Japanese advances were a nearly complete tactical success.

In the long term, the attack on Pearl Harbor was a [[grand strategy|grand strategic]] blunder for Japan. Indeed, Admiral Yamamoto, who conceived it, predicted even success here could not win a war with the United States, because American productive capacity was too large. It spurred the United States into a determination to fight to complete victory. The war resulted in the destruction of the Japanese armed forces, the [[Occupation of Japan|occupation of the home islands]] (a state never before achieved in Japan's history), and the occupation of [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands|Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands]] by the United States until 1972, while the Soviet Russian re-annexation of the [[Kurile Islands]] and [[Sakhalin Island]]'s southern part, and the restoration of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Formosa (Taiwan)]] to [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]], and the loss of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]] have not been reversed to this day.

The '''Corrigan Oil 200''' is a [[NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series]] race that takes place at [[Michigan International Speedway]]. The event was started in 1999 and was won by [[Greg Biffle]]. In 2001 Michigan did not hold a [[NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series]] race because of date conflicts with the CART event which it had been associated. The 2004 race marked the first win for Toyota in a national NASCAR series when [[Travis Kvapil]] won for [[Bang! Racing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kvapil wins after starting 30th|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/news/story?id=1850011|accessdate=2 July 2013|newspaper=[[ESPN]]|date=31 July 2004|author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Daly's Theatre and Leicester Square, London.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Daly's Theatre and Leicester Square, c. 1905]]
'''Daly's Theatre''' was a theatre in the [[City of Westminster]]. It was located at 2 Cranbourn Street, just off [[Leicester Square]].  It opened on 27 June 1893, and was demolished in 1937.

==Early years==
The theatre was originally built for American producer [[Augustin Daly]] by the English theatre manager [[George Edwardes]].  The architect was Spencer Chadwick, who was assisted by [[Charles J. Phipps|C. J. Phipps]].  The theatre was one of the first in London to be built using the [[cantilever]] system, and the Italian Renaissance and neo-classical facade was more elaborate than that of most London theatres.  Likewise, the entrance hall and foyer were elaborately executed and decorated.  The Victorian style to minimize colouring and design in the auditorium was abandoned, and instead bold designs and colours were used.  It had a seating capacity of over 1,200 in three tiers.&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Graphic'', 28 June 1893, reprinted in Mander &amp; Mitchenson's ''Lost Theatres of London''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre opened with ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', with Daly's star from his American company, [[Ada Rehan]], playing Katharina. This was followed by Sheridan Knowles's ''The Hunchback'', with [[Violet Vanbrugh]], and in 1894 by ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' and ''[[As You Like It]]'' and the younger Dumas's ''La Dame aux camélias'', with [[Eleonora Duse]].

==The Edwardes years==
[[File:Cover of the Vocal Score of Sidney Jones' The Geisha.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of the Vocal Score]]
In 1894, Edwardes took over management of the theatre himself.  He hired [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]] as the resident composer and music director, and the theatre became well known for a string of highly successful [[Edwardian musical comedy]] productions composed mostly by Jones, many with additional songs by [[Lionel Monckton]].

[[File:Daly's Theatre.PNG|right|thumb|Daly was no longer involved with the theatre by 1899]]The shows represented a step forward in the evolution of [[musical theatre]]. They had coherent plots and music specifically composed for the plot of each piece. After the first few of these pieces, they became more like what musical comedy was to become at maturity than their [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] siblings, the more [[revue]]-like "Girl" musicals.  The early Daly's Theatre shows, mostly with books by critic-turned-playwright [[Owen Hall]] and lyrics by [[Harry Greenbank]] and the prolific [[Adrian Ross]], included the breakout hit, ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' (1894), ''[[An Artist's Model]]'' (1895), and the three most successful musical comedies of the era: ''[[The Geisha]]'' (1896), ''[[A Greek Slave]]'' (1898) and ''[[San Toy]]'' (1899).  The shows starred actors such as leading lady [[Marie Tempest]], dancer-soubrette [[Letty Lind]], leading men [[C. Hayden Coffin]] and [[Scott Russell (tenor)|Scott Russell]], and comics [[Huntley Wright]] and [[Rutland Barrington]].

These were followed by ''[[A Country Girl]]'' (1902) and ''[[The Cingalee]]'' (1904), with books by [[James T. Tanner]]. Edwardes was clever at gauging the changing tastes of his audiences. For a time, he successfully presented English adaptations of continental European operettas, like ''[[The Little Michus]]'' (1905), ''[[The Merveilleuses]]'' (1906), the highly successful ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' (1907), ''[[The Dollar Princess]]'' (1909), ''[[The Count of Luxembourg]]'' (1911), [[Gipsy Love (operetta)|Gipsy Love]] (1912) and ''[[Betty (musical)|Betty]]'' (1915).  In this series, [[Percy Greenbank]] replaced his brother Harry, who had died at the age of 33, songwriter [[Paul Rubens (composer)|Paul Rubens]] joined the team, and new actors joined or replaced the older ones, including leading men [[Bertram Wallis]], [[Courtice Pounds]] and [[Robert Evett]], and leading ladies [[Gertie Millar]], [[Lily Elsie]], [[Gabrielle Ray]], [[Isabel Jay]], [[Louie Pounds]] and [[Evie Greene]].

==After Edwardes==
[[File:Jose Collins Maid.jpg|right|thumb|''[[The Maid of the Mountains]]'']]
Edwardes died in 1915, leaving his estate in considerable debt.  The theatre continued to be managed by Robert Evett as part of Edwardes's estate.  Evett directed and produced ''[[The Happy Day]]'' (1916) and the smash hit, ''[[The Maid of the Mountains]]'' (1917), both starring [[José Collins]]. The show ran for a record-breaking three years and saved the Edwardes estate.  This was followed by ''[[A Southern Maid]]'' (1917; revived 1920) and ''Our Peg'' (later adapted into ''Our Nell'').  Evett also directed revivals of ''[[The Dollar Princess]]''.

Later, other managements took over the theatre.  In 1927, [[Noël Coward]]'s famous flop ''[[Sirocco (play)|Sirocco]]'' played at Daly's.  After this failure, Daly's returned to musical comedies but found little further success.  ''That's a Pretty Thing'' played in 1933, ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'' was revived in 1934, and ''Young England'' was transferred there in 1935.  The theatre eventually closed in 1937 after the last performance of ''The First Legion'' and was sold to [[Warner Brothers]] who demolished the theatre and built a large theatre and cinema called the Warner Theatre designed by [[Thomas Somerford]] and E. A. Stone with a marble facade sculpted by [[Edward Bainbridge Copnall|Bainbridge Copnall]], featuring a large relief panel in two corners depicting the spirits of sight and sound.&lt;ref name=CT&gt;{{cite web|title=Vue West End|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/3778| work=cinematreasures.org| publisher=Cinema Treasures| accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This building was demolished, but the marble frontage was retained, and the site was redeveloped as the ''[[Warner Village Cinemas|Warner Village]] cinema complex''. It changed hands again, and is now the ''[[Vue West End]]''.&lt;ref name=CT/&gt;

It was co-founded in 1979 by [[Carl Djerassi]], the inventor of the [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]], and [[Diane Middlebrook]]. The residency is competitive and held at no cost to the artists. The location was a former cattle ranch.

'''Duke St. Rollins''' is a U.S-based [[Progressivism|politically progressive]] [[Troll (Internet)|Internet troll]] on [[Facebook]] who received mainstream press notoriety for his socially critical and witty commentary in reply to posts made by major U.S. political and [[Media bias|conservative media]] figures. His outputs have been dubbed by [[mainstream media]] [[journalist]]s as "extraordinary" and coming from "a performance artist." Among his favored targets are Governor [[Jan Brewer]] of Arizona, Sheriff [[Joe Arpaio]] of [[Maricopa County, Arizona]], and [[Fox News Channel]] program host [[Sean Hannity]].&lt;ref&gt;"Duke St. Rollins on Jan Brewer, Ted Nugent, Joe Arpaio, Sean Hannity, Teabagger Spelling Errors, and More," ''Phoenix New Times'', 6 July 2012, http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bastard/2012/07/duke_st_rollins_on_jan_brewer.php?page=2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Joe Arpaio Owned by the Infamous Duke St. Rollins," ''Phoenix New Times'', 30 June 2012, http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bastard/2012/06/joe_arpaio_owned_by_duke_st_ro.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The League of Extraordinary Internet Trolls," 04 Sept 2012, http://blogs.houstonpress.com/artattack/2012/09/extraordinary_internet_trolls.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and identity ==
[[File:Duke-st-rollins-answers-question-about-romney-vp-pick.jpg|thumb|265px|Example of Duke St. Rollins' trolling of Sean Hannity's Facebook page.]]
According to Stephen Lemons of the ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'', the real-life person behind the moniker Duke St. Rollins was an executive in the [[banking]] industry, was in his mid-40s, and lived in the Northeastern U.S. while he gained his notoriety as Duke St. Rollins. The person had used several other monikers that incorporated the word "troll" (Duke S'''t. Roll'''ins) and administered several other accounts, also noted by the same press accounts, with which he used to troll for political purposes. At first, he began trolling satirically as what he described as "a hard-right [[Tea party|tea-bagger]]" but later switched to a more direct approach.&lt;ref&gt;"Duke St. Rollins on Jan Brewer, Ted Nugent, Joe Arpaio, Sean Hannity, Teabagger Spelling Errors, and More," ''Phoenix New Times'', 06 July 2012, http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bastard/2012/07/duke_st_rollins_on_jan_brewer.php?page=2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Joe Arpaio Owned by the Infamous Duke St. Rollins," ''Phoenix New Times'', 30 June 2012, http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bastard/2012/06/joe_arpaio_owned_by_duke_st_ro.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The League of Extraordinary Internet Trolls," 04 Sept 2012, http://blogs.houstonpress.com/artattack/2012/09/extraordinary_internet_trolls.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
St. Rollins favored using the word "[[cunt]]" to describe people with which he disagreed. He described in his indelicate self-authored ''Comedy Manifesto'', which governed his trolling and described his philosophy,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people hate the word cunt. I fucking love it. It is not misogynistic, and a lot of women understand this and have no issue with it. It is usually the PC pussy liberals who get on my case about it. I don't care. I won't stop saying it.&lt;ref&gt;"Duke St. Rollins on Jan Brewer, Ted Nugent, Joe Arpaio, Sean Hannity, Teabagger Spelling Errors, and More," ''Phoenix New Times'', 06 July 2012, http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bastard/2012/07/duke_st_rollins_on_jan_brewer.php?page=2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference''' was held in [[The Hague]] from 23 August to 2 November 1949, between representatives of the [[Netherlands]], the Republic of [[Indonesia]] and the BFO ([[Federal Consultative Assembly]]) representing various states the Dutch had created in the Indonesian archipelago.  Prior to this conference, three other high-level meetings between the Netherlands and Indonesia took place; the [[Linggadjati Agreement]] (1947), the [[Renville Agreement]] (1948), and the [[Roem-van Roijen Agreement]] (1949). The conference ended with the [[Netherlands]] agreeing to transfer sovereignty to the [[United States of Indonesia]].

==Background==
On 17 August 1945, Indonesian nationalist leader [[Sukarno]] declared [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|Indonesian independence]]. The Dutch who had been expelled in 1942 by the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|invading Japanese]], viewed the Indonesian leadership as Japanese collaborators, and wanted to regain control of their [[Dutch East Indies|colony]].{{sfn|Ricklefs |2008|pp=341–344}} The conflict between the Dutch and Indonesian nationalists developed into a full-scale [[Indonesian National Revolution|war of independence]]. By mid-1946, both sides were under international pressure to negotiate.{{sfn|Ricklefs |2008|p=358}} The Dutch favoured a federal Indonesian state, and organised a conference in [[Malino Conference|Malino]] in July 1946, which led to the establishment of the [[State of East Indonesia]]. In November, the Dutch and Indonesian sides reached an [[Linggadjati Agreement|agreement at Linggadjati]], in which the Netherlands agreed to recognize Republican rule over [[Java]], [[Sumatra]] and [[Madura]], and that Republic would become a constituent state of a federal [[United States of Indonesia]]. 28 January 1949, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 67|Resolution 67]] calling for an end to the recent [[Operatie Kraai|Dutch military offensive]] against Republican forces in Indonesia and demanding the restoration of the Republican government. It also urged the resumption of negotiations to find a peaceful settlement between the two sides.{{sfn|Ide Anak Agung|1973|p=60}}

Following 6 July [[Roem-van Roijen Agreement]], which effectively endorsed the Security Council resolution, [[Mohammad Roem]] said that the Republic of Indonesia, whose leaders were still in exile in [[Bangka Island|Bangka]], would participate in the Round Table Conference to accelerate the transfer of sovereignty.{{sfn|Ide Anak Agung|1973|pp=64–65}}

The Indonesian government, in exile for over six months, returned to the temporary capital at [[Yogyakarta]] on 6 July 1949. To ensure commonality of negotiating position between the Republic and the federal delegates, in the second half of July 1949 and from 31 July – 2 August, Inter-Indonesian Conferences were in Yogyakarta between all component authorities of the future [[United States of Indonesia]]. The delegates agreed on the basic principles and outline for the [[Federal Constitution of 1949|constitution]].{{sfn|Ide Anak Agung|1973|pp=66–67}}

Following preliminary discussions sponsored by the UN Commission for Indonesia in Jakarta, it was decided the Round Table Conference would be held in [[The Hague]].

==Negotiations==
The negotiations, which took place from 23 August to 2 November 1949, were assisted by the United Nations Commission for Indonesia. The Dutch, Republic of Indonesia and BFO delegations reached agreement resulting in a number of documents, namely a Charter of Transfer of Sovereignty (to come into immediate effect), a Statute of Union, a draft constitution, an economic agreement and agreements on social and military affairs.{{sfn|Ide Anak Agung|1973|p=70}}{{sfn|Kahin|1961|p=433}}

The Dutch-Indonesian Union would not have any powers: it would be a consultative body with a permanent secretariat, a court of arbitration to settle any legal disputes, and a minimum of two ministerial conferences every year. It would be headed by the Dutch Queen in an entirely symbolic role.{{sfn|Kahin|1961|pp=435–436}}

The delegations also reached agreement on the withdrawal of Dutch troops "within the shortest possible time", and for the United States of Indonesia to grant [[most favoured nation]] status to the Netherlands. In addition, there would be no discrimination against Dutch nationals or companies and the Republic agreed to take over trade agreements negotiated by the [[Dutch East Indies]].{{sfn|Kahin|1961|p=437}} However the two major areas of disagreement were over the debts of the Dutch colonial administration and the status of [[Western New Guinea]].
[[Image:Round Table Conference.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The Round Table Conference in session]]
Negotiations over the internal and external debts of the [[Dutch East Indies]] colonial administration were protracted, with each side presenting their own calculations and arguing over whether the United States of Indonesia should be responsible for debts incurred by the Dutch after their [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|surrender to the Japanese]] in 1942. In particular the Indonesian delegations were indignant at having to cover what it saw as the costs of Dutch military action against it.  Finally, thanks to the intervention of the US member of the UN Commission on Indonesia, the Indonesian side came to realise that agreeing to pay part of the Dutch debt would be the price they would have to pay for the transfer of sovereignty. On 24 October, the Indonesian delegations agreed that Indonesia would take over approximately 4.3 billion [[Dutch guilder|Guilders]] of Dutch East Indies government debt.{{sfn|Kahin|1961|pp=439–443}}

The issue of the inclusion or not of Western New Guinea almost resulted in the talks becoming deadlocked. The Indonesian delegations took the view that Indonesia should comprise the entire territory of Dutch East Indies. The Dutch refused to compromise, claiming Western New Guinea had no ethnic ties with the rest of the archipelago.{{sfn|Ide Anak Agung|1973|p=67}} Despite Dutch public opinion supporting transfer of Western New Guinea to Indonesia, the Dutch cabinet was worried it would not be able to ratify the Round Table Agreement in parliament if it conceded this point.{{sfn|Kahin|1961|p=443-444}} Finally, in the early hours of 1 November 1949 a compromise was reached: the status of Western New Guinea would be determined through negotiations between the United States of Indonesia and the Netherlands within a year of the transfer of sovereignty.{{sfn|Ide Anak Agung|1973|p=69-70}} The conference was officially closed in the [[Ridderzaal|Dutch parliament building]] on 2 November 1949.

==Aftermath==
The Dutch parliament debated the agreement, and the upper and lower houses ratified it on 21 December by the two-thirds majority needed. Despite criticism in particular of the Indonesian assumption of Dutch government debt and the unresolved status of West Papua, the Indonesian legislature, the [[Central Indonesian National Committee]], ratified the agreement on 14 December 1949. Sovereignty was transferred to the United States of Indonesia on 27 December 1949.{{sfn|Kahin|1961|pp=443–444}}{{sfn|Ide Anak Agung|1973|pp=70–71}}

'''Earthcore''' is an Australian outdoor dance [[music festival]] and electronic music event. The outdoor events were generally held in forest environments around [[Victoria, Australia]], with some events held in [[Queensland]] and overseas in [[New Caledonia]].  Earthcore has operated since 1992. After the Earthcore Carnival that ran from the 28th to 30 November 2008, Earthcore took a hiatus before returning for their 20-year anniversary celebration in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/music/end-of-the-earthcore/2008/11/27/1227491711042.html|title=End of the Earthcore|website=Theage.com.au|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earthcore returned to its traditional ground roots festival beginning with the 20 year anniversary in 2013 to celebrate the event that introduced Australia to the outdoor electronic dance music festival. With a new home amongst the rolling hills of Pyalong in country Victoria, Earthcore  was again held in November 2014 with one of the largest lineups to date including favourites Hallucinogen and Shpongle as headliners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthcore.com.au|title=Earthcore|website=Earthcore.com.au|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earthcore continued to operate in Pyalong until 2016 and moved to Elmore Victoria for the 2017 festival.

==History==
[[File:Michele Adamson Earthcore 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Michele Adamson at Earthcore 2006]]
Over the years, events included large outdoor festivals, one night weekly club events, warehouse parties, one-off large-scale indoor parties, events on boats and a club on a moving train.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090928065748/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/people/Earthcore] &lt;/ref&gt; The peak Earthcore event was the 2000 [[New Year's Eve]] party which went for seven days and was attended by up to 15,000 people over the seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/11/28/1069825990550.html?from=storyrhs|title=A music odyssey deep in the forestu|website=Theage.com.au|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 2017, Earthcore events in three states were cancelled abruptly. Earthcore blamed the cancellations on what they alleged was a smear campaign by international artist Coming Soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themusic.com.au/news/all/2017/11/27/earthcore-blames-%E2%80%98smear-campaign%E2%80%99-as-wa-and-qld-events-cancelled/|title=Earthcore Blames ‘Smear Campaign’ As WA &amp; Qld Events Cancelled|website=Themusic.com.au|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, many of the bands countered that the cancellations were in fact because they hadn't been paid for their performances, and hadn't been given their air tickets, and so wouldn't be attending.

The '''''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill''' occurred in [[Prince William Sound]], [[Alaska]], March 24, 1989, when ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'', an [[oil tanker]] owned by [[Exxon Shipping Company]], bound for [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], California, struck [[Prince William Sound]]'s [[Bligh Reef]], 1.5 miles west of [[Tatitlek, Alaska]] at 12:04&amp;nbsp;am&lt;ref name="skinner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/10867/spill/timeline.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102105252/http://library.thinkquest.org/10867/spill/timeline.shtml |archivedate=November 2, 2013 |title=EVOS: The Spill: Timeline|date=November 2, 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; local time and [[oil spill|spilled]] {{convert|10.8|e6USgal|oilbbl}}(or a [[mass]] of 35,000 [[Tonne|metric tonnes]]) of [[crude oil]] over the next few days.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; It is considered to be one of the most devastating human-caused [[environmental disaster]]s.&lt;ref name="AUTOREF" /&gt; The ''Valdez'' spill is the second largest in US waters, after the 2010 [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill]], in terms of volume released.&lt;ref name="histories" /&gt; Prince William Sound's remote location, accessible only by helicopter, plane, or boat, made government and industry response efforts difficult and severely taxed existing response plans. The region is a [[habitat]] for [[salmon]], [[sea otter]]s, [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[seabird]]s. The oil, originally extracted at the [[Prudhoe Bay oil field]], eventually covered {{convert|1300|mi|km}} of coastline,&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; and {{convert|11000|sqmi|km2}} of ocean.&lt;ref name="SpillAroundUs"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shigenaka&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shigenaka|first1=Gary|title=Twenty-Five Years After the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill: NOAA's Scientific Support, Monitoring, and Research|url=http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/Exxon_Valdez_25YearsAfter_508_0.pdf|website=Office of Response and Restoration|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=January 17, 2017|location=Seattle|format=PDF|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to official reports, the ship was carrying 53,094,510 gallons (1,264,155 barrels) of oil, of which about {{convert|10.8|e6USgal|oilbbl m3}} were spilled into the Prince William Sound.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;&lt;ref name="skinner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scientific american" /&gt; An approximate figure of {{convert|11|e6USgal|oilbbl m3}} was a commonly accepted estimate of the spill's volume and has been used by the State of Alaska's ''Exxon Valdez'' Oil Spill Trustee Council,&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt; the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] and environmental groups such as [[Greenpeace]] and the [[Sierra Club]].&lt;ref name="histories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="greenpeace" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTOREF2" /&gt;

[[File:OilSheenFromValdezSpill.jpg|thumb|right|During the first few days of the spill, heavy sheens of oil covered large areas of the surface of Prince William Sound.]]

Multiple factors have been identified as contributing to the incident:

[[File:OilPoolFromValdezSpill.jpeg|thumb|right|Beginning three days after the vessel grounded, a storm pushed large quantities of fresh oil on to the rocky shores of many of the beaches in the Knight Island chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exxon Valdez Photos|url=http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/photos/exxon/07.html|publisher=NOAA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050714233007/http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/photos/exxon/07.html |archivedate=July 14, 2005 |page=7|quote=Beginning 3 days after the vessel grounded, a storm pushed large quantities of fresh oil onto the rocky shores of many of the beaches in the Knight Island chain.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this photograph, pooled black oil is shown stranded in the rocks]]
* Exxon Shipping Company failed to supervise the [[Sea captain|master]] and provide a rested and sufficient crew for ''Exxon Valdez''. The [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] found this was widespread throughout the industry, prompting a safety recommendation to Exxon and to the industry.&lt;ref Name=NTSB/&gt;
* The third mate failed to properly maneuver the vessel, possibly due to fatigue or excessive workload.&lt;ref Name=NTSB&gt;{{Cite book|title=Practices that relate to the ''Exxon Valdez'' |date=September 18, 1990 |pages=1–6 |place=Washington, DC |publisher=National Transportation and Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/Recs/letters/1990/M90_26_31a.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611194527/http://www.ntsb.gov/Recs/letters/1990/M90_26_31A.pdf |archivedate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exxon Shipping Company failed to properly maintain the [[Raytheon]] Collision Avoidance System (RAYCAS) [[radar]], which, if functional, would have indicated to the third mate an impending collision with the [[Bligh Reef]] by detecting the "radar reflector", placed on the next rock inland from Bligh Reef for the purpose of keeping ships on course. This cause has only been identified by [[Greg Palast]] (without evidentiary support) and is not present in the official accident report.&lt;ref name="AUTOREF4" /&gt;

Captain [[Joseph Hazelwood]], who was widely reported to have been drinking heavily that night, was not at the controls when the ship struck the reef. However, as the senior officer, he was in command of the ship even though he was asleep in his bunk. In light of the other findings, investigative reporter Greg Palast stated in 2008, "Forget the drunken skipper fable. As to Captain Joe Hazelwood, he was below decks, sleeping off his bender. At the helm, the third mate never would have collided with Bligh Reef had he looked at his RAYCAS radar. But the radar was not turned on. In fact, the tanker's radar was left broken and disabled for more than a year before the disaster, and Exxon management knew it. It was just too expensive to fix and operate."&lt;ref name="AUTOREF5" /&gt; Exxon blamed Captain Hazelwood for the grounding of the tanker.&lt;ref name="AUTOREF4" /&gt;

Other factors, according to an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] course entitled "Software System Safety" by Professor Nancy G. Leveson,&lt;ref name="AUTOREF6" /&gt; included:
# Ships were not informed that the previous practice of the Coast Guard tracking ships out to Bligh Reef had ceased.&lt;ref name="Leveson20" /&gt;
# The oil industry promised, but never installed, state-of-the-art iceberg monitoring equipment.&lt;ref name="Leveson18" /&gt;
# ''Exxon Valdez'' was sailing outside the normal sea lane to avoid small icebergs thought to be in the area.&lt;ref name="Leveson18" /&gt;
&lt;!--[[Wikipedia:Copyright violation]] copypaste and too close paraphrasing removed from here, page 18: radar station--&gt;
&lt;!--copypasta removed, page 19: Congressional approval--&gt;
# The 1989 tanker crew was half the size of the 1977 crew, worked 12- to 14-hour shifts, plus overtime. The crew was rushing to leave Valdez with a load of oil.&lt;ref name="Leveson19" /&gt;
# Coast Guard vessel inspections in Valdez were not performed, and the number of staff was reduced.&lt;ref name="Leveson19" /&gt;
# Lack of available equipment and personnel hampered the spill cleanup.&lt;ref name="Leveson20" /&gt;
This disaster resulted in International Maritime Organization introducing comprehensive [[marine pollution]] prevention rules ([[MARPOL]]) through various conventions. The rules were ratified by member countries and, under International Ship Management rules, the ships are being operated with a common objective of "safer ships and cleaner oceans".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MgoCpBaVJlMC&amp;lpg=PT193&amp;ots=aNOGwZO1fO&amp;dq=%22safer%20ships%20and%20cleaner%20oceans%22%20MARPOL&amp;pg=PT198#v=onepage&amp;q=%22safer%20ships%20and%20cleaner%20oceans%22%20MARPOL&amp;f=false|title=From T-2 to Supertanker: Development of the Oil Tanker, 1940 – 2000, Revised|last=Spyrou|first=Andrew G.|date=January 27, 2017 |publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781462002344|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ''Exxon Valdez'' Captain Joseph Hazelwood offered a "heartfelt apology" to the people of Alaska, suggesting he had been wrongly blamed for the disaster: "The true story is out there for anybody who wants to look at the facts, but that's not the sexy story and that's not the easy story," he said. Hazelwood said he felt Alaskans always gave him a fair shake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=Bill|title=Captain of Exxon Valdez offers 'heartfelt apology' for '89 oil spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound |url=http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2009/03/captain_of_exxon_valdez_offers.html |accessdate=January 17, 2017|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=March 5, 2009|location=Cleveland, OH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clean-up and environmental impact ==
[[File:OilCleanupAfterValdezSpill.jpg|thumb|left|Workers using high-pressure, hot-water washing to clean an oiled shoreline]]

Chemical dispersant, a [[surfactant]] and [[solvent]] mixture, was applied to the slick by a private company on March 24 with a helicopter. But the helicopter missed the target area. Scientific data on its toxicity were either thin or incomplete. In addition, public acceptance of a new, widespread chemical treatment was lacking. Landowners, fishing groups, and conservation organizations questioned the use of chemicals on hundreds of miles of shoreline when other alternatives may have been available."&lt;ref name="AUTOREF7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/static/PDFs/deccleanuptechniques.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/index.cfm?FA=facts.QA|title=Oil Spill Facts – Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council|first=''Exxon Valdez'' Oil Spill Trustee|last=Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by [[David Kirby (journalist)|David Kirby]] for [[TakePart]], the main component of the [[Corexit]] formulation used during cleanup, 2-butoxyethanol, was identified as "one of the agents that caused liver, kidney, lung, nervous system, and blood disorders among cleanup crews in Alaska following the 1989 ''Exxon Valdez'' spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/04/17/corexit-deepwater-horizon-oil-spill|title=Corexit: An Oil Spill Solution Worse Than the Problem?|last=Kirby|first=David|date=Apr 22, 2013|website=www.TakePart.com|publisher=Participant Media|access-date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanical cleanup was started shortly afterwards using booms and skimmers, but the skimmers were not readily available during the first 24 hours following the spill, and thick oil and [[kelp]] tended to clog the equipment. Despite civilian insistence for a complete clean, only 10% of total oil was actually completely cleaned.&lt;ref name="skinner" /&gt;  Exxon was widely  criticized for its slow response to cleaning up the disaster and John Devens, the mayor of [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], has said his community felt betrayed by Exxon's inadequate response to the crisis.&lt;ref name="AUTOREF8" /&gt; More than 11,000 Alaska residents, along with some Exxon employees, worked throughout the region to try to restore the environment. 
[[File:Exxon Valdez Cleanup.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Clean-up efforts after the ''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill]]

Because Prince William Sound contained many rocky coves where the oil collected, the decision was made to displace it with high-pressure hot water. However, this also displaced and destroyed the microbial populations on the shoreline; many of these organisms (e.g. [[plankton]]) are the basis of the coastal marine food chain, and others (e.g. certain bacteria and fungi) are capable of facilitating the [[biodegradation]] of oil.  At the time, both scientific advice and public pressure was to clean everything, but since then, a much greater understanding of [[bioremediation|natural]] and facilitated [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] processes has developed, due somewhat in part to the opportunity presented for study by the ''Exxon Valdez'' spill. Despite the extensive cleanup attempts, less than ten percent of the oil was recovered and a study conducted by NOAA determined that as of early 2007 more than {{convert|26|e3U.S.gal|m3}} of oil remain in the sandy soil of the contaminated shoreline, declining at a rate of less than 4% per year.&lt;ref name="AUTOREF9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;
[[File:EVOSWEB 013 oiled bird3.jpg|thumb|left|Wildlife was severely affected by the oil spill.]]

Both the long-term and short-term effects of the oil spill have been studied.&lt;ref name="AUTOREF11" /&gt; Immediate effects included the deaths of 100,000 to as many as 250,000 seabirds, at least 2,800 [[sea otter]]s, approximately 12 [[North American river otter|river otters]], 300 [[Common seal|harbor seals]], 247 [[bald eagle]]s, and 22 [[Killer whale|orcas]], and an unknown number of salmon and herring.&lt;ref name="scientific american" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTOREF12" /&gt;

In 2003, fourteen years after the spill, a team from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] found that the remaining oil was lasting far longer than anticipated, which in turn had resulted in more long-term loss of many species than had been expected.  The researchers found that at only a few parts per billion, [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ]] caused a long-term increase in mortality rates.  They reported that "species as diverse as sea otters, harlequin ducks and killer whales suffered large, long-term losses and that oiled mussel beds and other tidal shoreline habitats will take an estimated 30 years to recover."&lt;ref name="williamson" /&gt;

In 2006, a study done by the National Marine Fisheries Service in [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] found that about {{convert|6|mi|km}} of shoreline around Prince William Sound was still affected by the spill, with 101.6 tonnes of oil remaining in the area. Exxon Mobil denied any concerns over any remaining oil, stating that they anticipated a remaining fraction that they assert will not cause any long-term ecological impacts, according to the conclusions of the studies they had done: "We've done 350 peer-reviewed studies of Prince William Sound, and those studies conclude that Prince William Sound has recovered, it's healthy and it's thriving."&lt;ref name="still" /&gt; However, in 2007 a  [[NOAA]] study concluded that this contamination can produce chronic low-level exposure, discourage subsistence where the contamination is heavy, and decrease the "wilderness character" of the area.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

The effects of the spill continued to be felt for many years afterwards. As of 2010 there were an estimated {{convert|23000|USgal|m3}} of Valdez crude oil still in Alaska's sand and soil, breaking down at a rate estimated at less than 4% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/notice/75fr3706.pdf|title=Rules &amp; Notices – NOAA Fisheries Alaska Regional Office|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 2014, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the spill, NOAA scientists reported that some species seem to have recovered, with the sea otter the latest creature to return to pre-spill numbers.  Scientists who have monitored the spill area for the last 25 years report that concern remains for one of two pods of local orca whales, with fears that one pod may eventually die out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/25-years-later-scientists-remember-exxon-valdez-spill/#the-rundown|title=25 years later, scientists still spot traces of oil from Exxon Valdez spill|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Federal scientists estimate that between 16,000 and 21,000 US gallons (61 to 79 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of oil remains on beaches in Prince William Sound and up to 450 miles (725&amp;nbsp;km) away. Some of the oil does not appear to have biodegraded at all.  A [[USGS]] scientist who analyses the remaining oil along the coastline states that it remains among rocks and between tide marks.  "The oil mixes with seawater and forms an emulsion...Left out, the surface crusts over but the inside still has the consistency of mayonnaise – or mousse."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10717219/Exxon-Valdez-25-years-after-the-Alaska-oil-spill-the-court-battle-continues.html|title=Exxon Valdez – 25 years after the Alaska oil spill, the court battle continues|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alaska state senator Berta Gardner is urging Alaskan politicians to demand that the US government force ExxonMobil  to pay the final $92 million (£57 million) still owed from the court settlement.  The  major part of the money would be spent to finish cleaning up oiled beaches and attempting to restore the crippled herring population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Litigation and cleanup costs==
[[File:RaptorEducationGroupIncEagles.jpg|thumb|right|Eagles rescued from the oil spill]]
In the case of ''[[Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker|Exxon v. Baker]]'', an [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] jury awarded $287&amp;nbsp;million for [[actual damages]] and $5&amp;nbsp;billion for [[punitive damages]]. To protect itself in case the judgment was affirmed, Exxon obtained a $4.8&amp;nbsp;billion credit line from [[JPMorgan Chase|J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]], who created the first modern [[credit default swap]] so that they would not have to hold as much money in reserve against the risk of Exxon's default.&lt;ref name="AUTOREF13" /&gt;

Meanwhile, Exxon appealed the ruling, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] ordered the trial judge, Russel Holland, to reduce the punitive damages. On December 6, 2002, Holland announced that he had reduced the damages to $4&amp;nbsp;billion, which he concluded was justified by the facts of the case and was not grossly excessive. Exxon appealed again and the case returned to Holland to be reconsidered in light of a recent [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling in a similar case. Holland increased the punitive damages to $4.5&amp;nbsp;billion, plus interest.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

After more appeals, in December 2006 the damages award was cut to $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion. The court of appeals cited recent Supreme Court rulings relative to limits on punitive damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F3/490/490.F3d.1066.04-35183.04-35182.html|title=490 F.3d 1066|website=law.resource.org|accessdate=May 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exxon appealed again. On May 23, 2007, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied ExxonMobil's request for a third hearing and let stand its ruling that Exxon owed $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion in punitive damages. Exxon then appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.&lt;ref name="cert" /&gt; On February 27, 2008, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments. [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Samuel Alito]], who at the time, owned between $100,000 and $250,000 in Exxon stock, recused himself from the case.&lt;ref name="scotus" /&gt; In a decision issued June 25, 2008, written by Justice [[David Souter]], the court vacated the $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion award and remanded the case back to the lower court, finding that the damages were excessive with respect to [[Admiralty law|maritime common law]]. Exxon's actions were deemed "worse than negligent but less than malicious."&lt;ref name="latimes 080626" /&gt; The punitive damages were further reduced to an amount of  $507.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="scotusopinion" /&gt; The Court's ruling was that maritime punitive damages should not exceed the compensatory damages,&lt;ref name="scotusopinion" /&gt; supported by a precedent dating from 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Sharon|title=Exxon’s Legal Guardians|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2008/07/03/exxon-s-legal-guardians/|publisher=CounterPunch|accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] Chairman [[Patrick J. Leahy]] has decried the ruling as "another in a line of cases where this Supreme Court has misconstrued congressional intent to benefit large corporations."&lt;ref name="AUTOREF14" /&gt;

Exxon's official position was that punitive damages greater than $25&amp;nbsp;million were not justified because the spill resulted from an accident, and because Exxon spent an estimated $2&amp;nbsp;billion cleaning up the spill and a further $1&amp;nbsp;billion to settle related civil and criminal charges. Attorneys for the plaintiffs contended that Exxon bore responsibility for the accident because the company "put a drunk in charge of a tanker in Prince William Sound."&lt;ref name="AUTOREF15" /&gt;

Exxon recovered a significant portion of clean-up and legal expenses through insurance claims associated with the grounding of the ''Exxon Valdez''.&lt;ref name="hfw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="10K" /&gt; Also, in 1991, Exxon made a quiet, separate financial settlement of damages with a group of seafood producers known as the [[Seattle Seven]] for the disaster's effect on the Alaskan seafood industry. The agreement granted $63.75&amp;nbsp;million to the Seattle Seven, but stipulated that the seafood companies would have to repay almost all of any punitive damages awarded in other civil proceedings. The $5&amp;nbsp;billion in punitive damages was awarded later, and the Seattle Seven's share could have been as high as $750&amp;nbsp;million if the damages award had held. Other plaintiffs have objected to this secret arrangement,&lt;ref name="AUTOREF16" /&gt; and when it came to light, Judge Holland ruled that Exxon should have told the jury at the start that an agreement had already been made, so the jury would know exactly how much Exxon would have to pay.&lt;ref name="9th" /&gt;

As of December 15, 2009, Exxon had paid the entire $507.5 million in punitive damages, including lawsuit costs, plus interest, which were further distributed to thousands of plaintiffs.&lt;ref name=EQSFnews&gt;{{cite web|title=News and Information|url=http://www.exspill.com/News/tabid/1901/Default.aspx|publisher=Exxon Qualified Settlement Fund|accessdate=March 21, 2013|quote=December 15, 2009 [...] Exxon has now paid to the EQSF all monies owed in the EVOS litigation pursuant to the punitive damages judgment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1989, Exxon filed suit against the State of Alaska, charging that the state had interfered with Exxon's attempts to clean up the spill by refusing to approve the use of dispersant chemicals until the night of the 26th. The state disputed the claim, stating that there was a long-standing agreement to allow the use of dispersants to clean up spills, thus Exxon did not require permission to use them, and that in fact Exxon had not had enough dispersant on hand to effectively handle a spill of the size created by the ''Valdez''.&lt;ref name=exxonvalaska&gt;{{cite web|title=Exxon Sues Alaska, Charging Cleanup Delay|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/25/us/exxon-sues-alaska-charging-cleanup-delay.html|publisher=New York Times|date=October 25, 1989|accessdate=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exxon filed claims in October 1990 against the Coast Guard, asking to be reimbursed for cleanup costs and damages awarded to plaintiffs in any lawsuits filed by the State of Alaska or the federal government against Exxon. The company claimed that the Coast Guard was "wholly or partially responsible" for the spill, because they had granted mariners' licenses to the crew of the Valdez, and because they had given the ''Valdez'' permission to leave regular shipping lanes to avoid ice. They also reiterated the claim that the Coast Guard had delayed cleanup by refusing to give permission to immediately use chemical dispersants on the spill.&lt;ref name=exxonvalaska2&gt;{{cite web|title=Exxon, Blaming Coast Guard, Says U.S. Is Liable in Alaska Spill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/02/us/exxon-blaming-coast-guard-says-us-is-liable-in-alaska-spill.html|publisher=New York Times|date=October 2, 1990|accessdate=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political consequences and reforms==

The  Oil Spill Recovery Institute was formed after United States Congress approved it to seek a solution. Collaborating with [[InnoCentive]] they found a partial solution for the flow of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Travis|first1=J.|title=SCIENCE AND COMMERCE: Science by the Masses|journal=Science|date=March 28, 2008|volume=319|issue=5871 |pages=1750–1752|doi=10.1126/science.319.5871.1750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coast Guard report===
A report by the [[Missions of the United States Coast Guard#National Response Center|US National Response Team]] summarized the event and made a number of recommendations, such as changes to the work patterns of Exxon crew in order to address the causes of the accident.&lt;ref name="skinner" /&gt;

===Oil Pollution Act of 1990===
In response to the spill, the [[Congress of the United States|United States Congress]] passed the [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990]] (OPA). The legislation included a clause that prohibits any vessel that, after March 22, 1989, has caused an oil spill of more than {{convert|1|e6USgal|m3}} in any marine area, from operating in Prince William Sound.&lt;ref name="opa" /&gt;

In April 1998, the company argued in a legal action against the Federal government that the ship should be allowed back into Alaskan waters. Exxon claimed OPA was effectively a [[bill of attainder]], a regulation that was unfairly directed at Exxon alone.&lt;ref name="attainder" /&gt; In 2002, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Exxon. As of 2002, OPA had prevented 18 ships from entering Prince William Sound.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

OPA also set a schedule for the gradual phase in of a [[double hull]] design, providing an additional layer between the oil tanks and the ocean. While a double hull would likely not have prevented the ''Valdez'' disaster, a Coast Guard study estimated that it would have cut the amount of oil spilled by 60 percent.&lt;ref name="AUTOREF17" /&gt;

The ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' supertanker was towed to San Diego, arriving on July 10. Repairs began on July 30. Approximately {{convert|1600|ST|t|lk=on}} of steel were removed and replaced. In June 1990 the tanker, renamed ''S/R Mediterranean'', left harbor after $30&amp;nbsp;million of repairs.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; It was still sailing as of January 2010, registered in [[Panama]]. The vessel was then owned by a Hong Kong company, who operated it under the name ''Oriental Nicety''. In August 2012, it was beached at Alang, India and dismantled.

===Alaska regulations===
In the aftermath of the spill, Alaska governor [[Steve Cowper]] issued an executive order requiring two [[tugboat]]s to escort every loaded tanker from Valdez out through Prince William Sound to Hinchinbrook Entrance. As the plan evolved in the 1990s, one of the two routine tugboats was replaced with a {{convert|210|ft|adj=on}} [[Escort Response Vehicle]] (ERV). Tankers at Valdez are no longer single-hulled.  Congress enacted legislation requiring all tankers to be [[double hull|double-hulled]] as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fargo Balliett|first1=James|title=Oceans: Environmental Issues, Global Perspectives|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317463665|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic and personal impact==
In 1991, following the collapse of the local marine population (particularly clams, herring and seals) the [[Chugach Alaska Corporation]], an [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations|Alaska Native Corporation]], filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]].  It has since recovered.&lt;ref name="AUTOREF19" /&gt;

According to several studies funded by the state of Alaska, the spill had both short-term and long-term economic effects. These included the loss of [[recreational sport]]s, fisheries, reduced tourism, and an estimate of what economists call "[[existence value]]", which is the value to the public of a pristine Prince William Sound.&lt;ref&gt;1994, Victor Goldberg, The Journal of Legal Studies, Recovery for Economic Loss Following the Exxon ‘Valdez’ Oil Spill"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fisheries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tourism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTOREF20" /&gt;

The economy of the city of [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]], Alaska was adversely affected after the spill damaged stocks of [[salmon]] and [[herring]] in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/03/24/292411071/25-years-after-spill-alaska-town-struggles-back-from-dead-zone|title=25 Years After Spill, Alaska Town Struggles Back From 'Dead Zone'|website=NPR.org |accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2014/03/24/exxon-spill-anniversary|title=Native Alaskans Still Reeling 25 Years After Exxon-Valdez Oil Spill|website=www.wbur.org|language=en|accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The village of [[Chenega, Alaska|Chenega]] was transformed into an emergency base and media outlet.The local villagers had to cope with a tripling of their population from 80 to 250. When asked how they felt about the situation, a village councillor noted that they were too shocked and busy to be depressed; others emphasized the human costs of leaving children unattended while their parents worked to clean up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daley|first=Patrick|last2=O'Neill|first2=Dan|date=December 1, 1991|title="Sad Is Too Mild a Word": Press Coverage of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill|url=http://academic.oup.com/joc/article/41/4/42/4210081|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=41|issue=4|pages=42–57|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1991.tb02330.x|issn=0021-9916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Native Americans were worried that too much time was spent on the fishery and not enough on the land that supports subsidence hunting.

In 2010, a [[CNN]] report alleged that many oil spill cleanup workers involved in the ''Exxon Valdez'' response had subsequently become sick. Anchorage lawyer Dennis Mestas found that this was true of 6,722 of 11,000 worker files he was able to inspect. Access to the records was controlled by Exxon. Exxon responded in a statement to CNN:   

&lt;blockquote&gt;After 20 years, there is no evidence suggesting that either cleanup workers or the residents of the communities affected by the Valdez spill have had any adverse health effects as a result of the spill or its cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Critics call Valdez cleanup a warning for Gulf workers - CNN.com|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/07/07/oil.spill.valdez.workers/|website = edition.cnn.com |accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Warning To Gulf Volunteers: Almost Every Cleanup Worker From The 1989 Exxon Valdez Disaster Is Now Dead|url = http://www.businessinsider.com.au/warning-to-gulf-cleanup-workers-almost-every-crew-member-from-the-1989-exxon-valdez-disaster-is-now-dead-2010-6 |website = Business Insider Australia |accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reactions==
In 1992, Exxon released a video titled ''Scientists and the Alaska Oil Spill'', to be distributed to schools. Dr. Michael Fry called it a piece of "corporate propaganda".&lt;ref name="AUTOREF10" /&gt;

In December 1994, the [[Unabomber]] assassinated [[Burson-Marsteller]] executive Thomas Mosser, accusing him of having "helped Exxon clean up its public image after the ''Exxon Valdez'' incident". The PR company claimed not to have been contracted during the actual crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reputed 'Manifesto' Recovered |first=Pierre |last=Thomas |first2=Benjamin |last2=Weiser |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/bkgrdstories.manifesto.htm |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=April 13, 1996 |page=A01  |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In popular culture ===
Several weeks after the spill, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' aired a pointed sketch featuring [[Kevin Nealon]], [[Phil Hartman]], and [[Victoria Jackson]] as cleanup workers struggling to scrub the oil off of animals and rocks on a beach in Prince William Sound.

In the 1995 film ''[[Waterworld]]'', the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' is the flagship of the movie's villain, "The Deacon," the leader of a band of scavenging raiders. In the ship is a portrait of their patron saint, [[Joseph Hazelwood]].

In the second [[Forrest Gump (character)|Forrest Gump]] novel, ''[[Gump and Co.]]'' by [[Winston Groom]], Gump commandeers the ''Exxon Valdez'' and accidentally crashes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hiaasen|first1=Rob|title=Remaking history with Gump sequel|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-08-12/features/1995224105_1_forrest-gump-sequel-tom-hanks|accessdate=31 March 2018|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=12 August 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race is on the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[European Hill Climb Championship]] Events Calendar and features on both [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] National Hill Climb Championships. It has taken place since 1927, being the most popular Hill Climb race in Portugal, with 200.000 spectators per edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoportal.iol.pt/desporto/velocidade-desporto/rampa-da-falperra-regressa-ao-campeonato-da-europa-de-montanha |title=Rampa da Falperra regressa ao Campeonato da Europa |publisher=Autoportal |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently contested by a variety of classes of cars, ([[touring cars]], [[sportscars]], [[single-seater]]) and has on average 250 competitors.

==History==
The first running of the Falperra Hill Climb was promoted by a local commission from [[Braga]] in 1927. The second edition has held in 1930 by the Automóvel Clube de Portugal, ACP (Portugal Automobile Association).

The competition was resumed in 1950 by the ACP, who named the 1950 edition as Falperra First Hill Climb, and all editions are accounted from 1950 edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.camminho.com/portal/images/stories/downloads/PALMARES_RAMPAS_FALPERRA.pdf |title=Palmarés da Rampa da Falperra |author=Clube Automóvel do Minho |accessdate=2014-01-03 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MMNiOvDm?url=http://www.camminho.com/portal/images/stories/downloads/PALMARES_RAMPAS_FALPERRA.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autosport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://autosport.pt/festa-em-braga-com-a-rampa-da-falperra=f96829 |title=AutoSport - Especialistas em desporto automóvel, Fórmula1, Rally, WRC, DTM, WEC, WTCC, NASCAR, INDY, LE MANS e DAKAR |publisher=autosport.pt |accessdate=2016-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714030411/http://autosport.pt/festa-em-braga-com-a-rampa-da-falperra%3Df96829 |archivedate=2015-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the Automóvel Clube do Minho ([[Minho Province|Minho]] Automobile Association) assumed the organization of the race and applied for an international competition. [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] integrated the race in their European Championship in 1978. Since that year, all the Falperra Hill Climbs where part of a [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] international calendar with the exception of the first race of 1984 (in this year there were two races: one in May for the national championship, and another in September for the European Championship).

In 2002, due to lack of understanding between local authorities to make security improvements at the track, the race was not realized until 2010, when that improvements were made.

In 2013 the race was in risk of not being held, but due to the pressure made by the Falperra HC supporters in social networks, the [[Braga]] city hall made the new pack of safety improvements requested by [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] in the same year.

===Current records===
The current record was set in 2017 by the Italian driver [[Simone Faggioli]], on the wheel of a [[Norma Auto Concept|Norma M20 FC]], with the time of 1:48.686, beating the record since 2015, scored by himself.

'''FEWS NET''', the '''Famine Early Warning Systems Network''', is a leading provider of information and analysis on food insecurity. Created in 1985 by the [http://www.usaid.gov/ US Agency for International Development] (USAID), and the US Department of State, after devastating famines in East and West Africa, FEWS NET today is a valuable resource to a vast community of governments, international relief agencies, NGOs, journalists, and researchers planning for, responding to, and reporting on humanitarian crises. With support from a technical team in Washington, D.C., FEWS NET staff based in more than 20 country offices collaborate with US government agencies, national government ministries and international partners to collect data and produce objective, forward-looking analysis on the world’s most food-insecure countries. Using an integrated approach that considers climate, agriculture production, prices, trade, nutrition, and other factors, together with an understanding of local livelihoods, FEWS NET forecasts most likely outcomes and anticipates change six to twelve months in advance. To help decision-makers and relief agencies plan for food emergencies, FEWS NET publishes monthly reports (available on its web site) on current and projected food insecurity, up-to-the-minute alerts on emerging or likely crises, and specialized reports on weather hazards, crops, market prices, and food assistance.

In 2010, to mark its 25th anniversary, produced a [http://vimeo.com/31031955 video] to document its work.

== Methodology ==

FEWS NET reporting focuses on acute food insecurity—sudden and/or short-term household food deficits caused by shocks—rather than chronic food insecurity, ongoing or cyclical food deficits related to persistent poverty and a lack of assets. 
In general, food insecurity is rarely the result of one causal factor. The strength and reliability of FEWS NET forecasting lies in its integrated consideration of the diversity of factors that lead to risk. Along with agricultural production, climate and weather, FEWS NET places analytical importance on markets and trade, livelihoods and sociopolitical issues such as conflict and humanitarian response. Key elements of FEWS NET's methodology include:   
* ''Classifying food insecurity'': FEWS NET describes the severity of food insecurity using the [http://www.ipcinfo.org/ Integrated Food Security Phase Classification version 2.0] (IPC 2.0), an international five-level scale. FEWS NET representatives were among the international food security leaders who designed the scale.
* ''Scenario development'' is at the heart of FEWS NET’s analytical process. In the simplest terms, scenario development can be described as a sophisticated “if-then” statement. In practice, this nine-step methodology relies on the creation of specific, informed assumptions about future events, their effects, and the likely responses of various actors. Considered in the context of current conditions and local livelihoods, these assumptions allow for the estimation of future food security outcomes and easy updating of the scenario as new information becomes available.
* ''Remote monitoring'': Since the 2008 global food price crisis, the risk of food insecurity has continued to rise in unexpected places. In 2010, FEWS NET responded to the demand for information on these new areas of concern by developing a lighter, scalable version of its traditional methodology. This approach, known as remote monitoring, centers on the identification and monitoring of anomalies that might lead to food insecurity. In remote monitoring, a FEWS NET coordinator covers a portfolio of countries, typically from a nearby regional office. Relying on a network of partners to collect and share data, the coordinator analyzes available information and produces monthly, two-page reports describing the current and projected food security situation.

Along with USAID, other US agencies make integral analytical contributions to FEWS NET reports.  They include:
* the [http://earlywarning.usgs.gov/fews/ US Geological Survey], which provides regular agroclimatology reports and technical advice on vegetation, water availability and other environmental and climate issues. Along with US-based staff, three USGS scientists in East, West and Southern Africa, offer analysis specific to those regions.        
* [http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/african_desk/cpc_intl/ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], through the Climate Prediction Center, provides rainfall estimates and atmospheric monitoring of weather patterns such as El Nino and La Nina events.
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120817214028/http://www.nasa.gov/ NASA] satellites provide imagery and raw data for USGS and NOAA analysis.
* the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130312233841/http://www.fas.usda.gov/icd/drd/tanzania.asp US Department of Agriculture], through the Foreign Agricultural Service, partners with FEWS NET on crop assessments and other agriculture-related activities.

[[Chemonics]], an international development company, supports FEWS NET's home office in Washington DC, as well as some 80 field-based staff, most of whom are nationals of the countries in which they work.

FEWS NET works closely with partners in the food security community, including international organizations such as the World Food Program and Food and Agriculture Organization and national ministries of agriculture and trade and national weather services. In certain countries, partnerships may involve joint reporting, joint field assessments and/or collaborative analysis. Examples of these partners include [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20131107024654/http%3A//www.cilss.bf/ Comité permanent Inter-Etats de Lutte contre la Sécheresse dans le Sahel] in West Africa and the [http://www.fsnau.org/ Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit] in Somalia.

== History ==
FEWS NET was created in response to the [[1984–1985 famine in Ethiopia|1984 - 1985 famines in Sudan and Ethiopia]], which resulted in the deaths of as many as 1 million people. From the beginning, the aim of the early warning system, then called "FEWS", was to anticipate impending famines and advise policy makers on how to prevent or mitigate such famines.  In July 2000, the initiative's name was changed to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, or FEWS NET, to signal the importance of collaborating with and strengthening national local food security information systems.

The '''Federated Logic Conference''' ('''FLoC''') is an international conglomeration of several [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]] related [[academic conference]]s that deal with the intersection of the two fields. FLoC traditionally includes:

* [[Computer Aided Verification]] (CAV)
* [[Logic in Computer Science]] (LICS)
* [[Rewriting Techniques and Applications]] (RTA)
* [[International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning]] (IJCAR) that itself conglomerates [[Conference on Automated Deduction]] (CADE), [[Theorem Proving in Higher-Order Logics]] (TPHOLs), and [[Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods]] (TABLEAUX).
* [[International Conference on Logic Programming]] (ICLP)

The first FLoC was held in 1996 at [[DIMACS]]; subsequently they have been held roughly every four years. FLoC 2018 was held in [[Oxford]].

'''Free Comic Book Day''', taking place on the first Saturday of May, is an annual [[promotion (marketing)|promotional]] effort by the [[North America]]n [[comic book]] industry to help bring new readers into independent [[direct market|comic book stores]]. Retailer Joe Field of Flying Colors Comics in [[Concord, California]] brainstormed the event in his "Big Picture" column in the August 2001 issue of ''[[Comics &amp; Games Retailer]]'' magazine. Free Comic Book Day started in 2002 and is coordinated by the industry's single large distributor, [[Diamond Comic Distributors]]. This is another event like the Comic Book Day which started in USA and is now celebrated across counries in Asia, Europe and Australia.

==History==
In 2001, retailer Joe Field was writing columns for an industry magazine, and saw how successful [[superhero film|feature films based on comic book franchises]] were providing the comic book industry with a positive cultural and financial turnaround from the [[comic book collecting#Bust of the speculator market|speculator bust]] of the late 1990s,&lt;ref name="CBGXtra"&gt;Miller, John Jackson (December 12, 2005).

"The 1900s: 10 biggest events from 100 years in comics", [[CBGXtra.com.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Field proposed Free Comic Book Day in one of his columns, and received positive reaction to it. Then-[[Image Comics]] publisher [[Jim Valentino]] suggested having the first Free Comic Book Day on the same weekend as the opening of the 2002 ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' feature film, in order to take advantage of the film's heavy promotion and related press about the comic book medium,&lt;ref name="Founder interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geeksunleashed.me/2013/05/02/interview-with-the-founder-of-free-comic-book-day-joe-field/|author=Brassington, Mark|title=Interview with the Founder of Free Comic Book Day - Joe Field|publisher=Geeks Unleashed.me|date=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverine FCBD"&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Thill|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/05/free-comic-book-day/|title=Free Comic Book Day Recruits Wolverine, Green Lantern|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=May 1, 2009|accessdate=February 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the first event was held May 4, 2002, one day after the film's opening.&lt;ref name="Founder interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Inquirer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/101553/tidbits-about-free-comic-book-day|title=Tidbits about Free Comic Book Day|publisher=Inquirer Lifestyle|date=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all events have corresponded with the release of a film based on a comic book.&lt;ref name="2006 guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/05/05/free-comic-book-day-2006-guide|title=Free Comic Book Day 2006 Guide|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 it was held in July,&lt;ref name="July FCBD 2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=3284|title=FCBD 2004 set for July 3rd, coincides with "Spider-Man 2"|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=March 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was moved back to the first Saturday in May the following year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=4005|title=Free Comic Book Day 2005 Date Chosen|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=September 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been held on that day ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freecomicbookday.com/Home/1/1/27/992|title=Free Comic Book Day homepage|publisher=FreeComicBookDay.com|accessdate=May 8, 2013|quote="Free Comic Book Day is a single day - the first Saturday in May each year"|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507165131/http://www.freecomicbookday.com/Home/1/1/27/992|archivedate=May 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Free Comic Book Day, participating comic book store retailers give away specially printed copies of free comic books, and some offer special deals and creator signings to those visiting their establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Cory|last=Doctorow|url=http://boingboing.net/2009/04/30/free-comic-book-day.html|title=Free Comic Book day this Saturday!|publisher=BoingBoing|date=April 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, retailers do not receive the issues for free; they pay 12–50 cents per copy for the comics they give away during the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carlson, Johanna Draper|url=http://comicsworthreading.com/2007/03/05/free-comic-book-day-free-for-whom/|title=Free Comic Book Day Free For Whom?|publisher=Comics Worth Reading|date=March 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LVRJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/arts-culture/here-s-everywhere-you-can-get-free-comic-books-saturday|title=Here’s everywhere you can get free comic books on Saturday|publisher=Las Vegas Review-Journal|last=Taylor|first=F.

==Effectiveness==
In its first six years, more than 2000 retailers in more than 30 countries gave away more than 12 million Free Comic Book Day special edition comic books. The success of the promotion rests with each participating retailer. Most participants agree that Free Comic Book Day has been part of a healthier comics market and growing comic book sales over the last several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/Home/4/1/73/1017?articleID=121128|title=Free Comic Book Day: A Talk with Joe Field|publisher=[[Diamond Comic Distributors]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gonzalez, Guy LeCharles|url=http://loudpoet.com/2005/02/18/interview-field-on-free-comic-book-day/|title=Interview: Field on Free Comic Book Day|publisher=LoudPoet.com|date=February 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free Comic Book Day has also garnered press coverage in the news media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diamondcomics.com/Home/1/1/3/122?articleID=11819|title=Outside the Panels: FCBD Coverage!|publisher=[[Diamond Comic Distributors]]|accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/books/free-comic-book-day-set-unleash-heroes-zombies-talking-mice-6C9748003|title=Free Comic Book Day set to unleash heroes, zombies, talking mice|publisher=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]|date=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the free publicity for the Free Comic Book Day event, and the comic book industry, from [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], over 1000 television news stations, and over 4000 online news outlets was estimated at $3.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diamondcomics.com/Home/1/1/3/597?articleID=149321|title=FCBD Media Coverage Generates Over $3.2 Million In Publicity|publisher=Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc.|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the number of shops participating in Free Comic Book Day increased 8% over how many participated in 2014 and the number of comic books ordered increased by 21%.&lt;ref name="2015orders"/&gt;

In some communities, the day is more grandly organized such as in [[London, Ontario]], Canada where most of its major comic book retailers, such as [[Heroes Comics]], as well as the [[London Public Library]]'s Central branch participate. On that day, these establishments cooperate in a major cross-promotion in which visitors are invited to collect stamps of each participating establishment for entry in a prize draw upon completion as well as various other activities which has evolved into a street festival in the city's downtown core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=De Bono|first1=Norman|title=Downtown London transformed into comic festival|url=http://lfpress.com/news/local-news/downtown-london-transformed-into-comic-festival|accessdate=6 May 2018|publisher=London Free Press|date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2013 event collected over 2000 such completed ballots, which does not account for more casual visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lemon|first=Marshall|title=The Crossover: How Free Comic Book Day Changed A Canadian College Town|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comicsandcosplay/11451-The-Crossover-How-Free-Comic-Book-Day-Changed-A-Canadian-College-Town|publisher= Escapist Magazine|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3616">'''Game''' or '''gameness''' is a quality of [[List of dog fighting breeds|fighting dogs]] and [[working terrier]]s that are [[selective breeding|selectively bred]] and [[Physical exercise|conditioned]] from a very early age to develop traits of eagerness despite the threat of substantive injury. Dogs displaying this trait can also be described as persevering, ready and willing, full of fight, spirited, or plucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why does my dog act that way?: a complete guide to your dog's personality|author=Stanley Coren|year=2006|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QEnmW1HJFOMC|isbn=978-0-7432-9855-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dog fighting breeds==
{{main|List of dog fighting breeds}}
In dog fighting breeds gameness is valued as it gives the dog the ability to maintain the attack in [[Bait (dogs)|baiting]], despite ripped [[flesh]], [[Fatigue (physical)|dehydration]], [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] or broken [[bone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781118704738.app31|title=Veterinary Forensics: Animal Cruelty Investigations|date=5 April 2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.,|pages=372–373|accessdate=20 September 2018|doi=10.1002/9781118704738.app31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10388073|title=The shadowy, paranoid world of dogfighting|first=Geoff|last=Cumming|date=23 June 2006|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2018|via=www.nzherald.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one writer describes it, "Game is the dog that won't quit fighting, the dog that'll die in the ring, the dog that'll fight with two broken legs."  The scope and method of training to develop a game dog varies dramatically depending on the level and experience of the dog-fighter. Some famous "gamebred" dogs are the [[American Pit Bull Terrier]], [[Bully Kutta]], [[Gull Terr]], the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Kerry Blue Terrier]], the [[Staffordshire Bull Terrier|English Pitbull]],[[American Staffordshire Terrier|Pitbull Amstaff]] the [[Japan|Japanese]] [[Tosa (dog)|Tosa Inu]] and the [[Argentina|Argentinean]] [[Dogo Argentino]].

==Working terrier breeds==
Pertaining to [[working terrier]]s and other small [[hunting dog]]s, [[earthdog trial]]s are used to determine the dog's gameness in hunting dangerous [[Vermin|pest species]] underground.  The [[American Working Terrier Association]] currently offers a Certificate of Gameness (CG) title&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.awta.org/awards/certificates/ | title=American Working Terrier Association Certificate of Gameness | accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a basic instinct test (meaning that it is done without conditioning/training the dog, to see if the dog naturally exhibits gameness) for working terriers and [[dachshund]]s. In the past, the [[Irish Kennel Club]] required the now-discarded [[Teastas Mor|Teastas Mor certification]] for champion animals (intended for breeding) which involved "showing gameness in attacking [[badger]]s. Five minutes is the minimum period a terrier shall be in contact with the badger, except when the terrier draws the badger in less time." "Drawing" meant pulling the badger out of the hole. The purpose of the Teastas Mor was to determine the dog's capabilities for work and fitness for breeding, not primarily for entertainment as in the [[Blood sport|blood-sports]] of [[Bait (dogs)|baiting]].

He was the third member of the [[List of political families in Greece#P|Papandreou family]] to serve as the country's prime minister, following his father Andreas and his grandfather [[Georgios Papandreou]]. He resigned on 11 November 2011 during the [[Greek government debt crisis]] to make way for a [[national unity government]].

==Early life and education==
Papandreou was born 16 June 1952 in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], United States, where his father, [[Andreas Papandreou]], at that time held a professorship at the [[University of Minnesota]]. His mother is American-born Margaret, ''née'' Chant.

He received his [[secondary education]] at schools in [[Illinois]] in the United States, in [[Sweden]], and graduated from [[King City Secondary School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/greek-prime-minister-george-papandreous-surprise-connection-to-canada|title=Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou’s surprise connection to Canada|last=Humphreys|first=Adrian|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (near [[Toronto]]) in [[Canada]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-15551196|title=Profile: George Papandreou|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=6 November 2011|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Amherst College]] in [[Massachusetts]] (where he was a friend and dormitory roommate of future political rival and prime minister of Greece himself, [[Antonis Samaras]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_1_04/12/2009_113043|title=As good as it gets|date=4 December 2009|publisher=ekathimerini|accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Stockholm University]], the [[London School of Economics]] and [[Harvard University]]. He has a bachelor of arts degree in sociology from Amherst (1975) and a master's degree in sociology from the LSE (1977). He was a researcher on immigration issues at Stockholm University in 1972–73. He was also a fellow of the Foreign Relations Center of [[Harvard University]] in 1992–93.
 	
In 2002 he was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws by Amherst College and in 2006 he was named distinguished professor in the Center for Hellenic Studies by [[Georgia State University|Georgia State College of Arts and Science]].
 	
Papandreou's father studied and worked as professor of economics from 1939 to 1959. His paternal grandfather, [[Georgios Papandreou]], was a three-time prime minister of Greece.

==Political career==
The younger George Papandreou came to Greece after the [[metapolitefsi|restoration of Greek democracy]] in 1974. He then became active in the political party his father had founded, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). He joined the Central Committee of PASOK in 1984.

Papandreou was elected to the Greek Parliament in 1981, the year his father became Prime Minister, as MP for the constituency of [[Achaea]]. He became Under Secretary for Cultural Affairs in 1985, Minister of Education and Religious Affairs in 1988, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1993, Minister for Education and Religious Affairs again in 1994, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs again in 1996 and Minister of Foreign Affairs in February 1999. He was also Minister Responsible for Government Coordination for the Bid for [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games]] in 1997.

[[File:George papandreou.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Papandreou in 2001, as Minister of Foreign Affairs]]
In his second term as Minister of Education, Papandreou was the first politician in Greece to introduce [[affirmative action]], allocating 5% of university posts for the Muslim minority in [[Western Thrace|Thrace]]. He was also instrumental in initiating the [[Open University]] in Greece.

Papandreou received numerous awards and honorary degrees in recognition of his work for human rights. As Foreign Minister he  fostered closer relations with Turkey and Albania. He worked to solve the [[Cyprus dispute|dispute over Cyprus]]. Papandreou also worked to resolve tensions regarding the [[Macedonia naming dispute]]. Papandreou stated in 1999 that he supported [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey's application to join the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World: Europe  EU warms towards Turkey|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/445482.stm|accessdate=23 February 2015|work=BBC News|date=13 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2003 [[European Voice]] shortlisted him for nomination of the [[European of the Year (European Voice award)|Europeans of the Year]] award as "Diplomat of the Year",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/ev50-europeans-of-the-year-2003/48225.aspx|title=EV50: Europeans of the Year 2003|newspaper=European Voice|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/page/the-evawards-europeans-of-the-year-winners-in-2003/2764.aspx |title=EV award winners: Europeans of the Year 2003|newspaper=EuropeanVoice|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; naming him as "The Bridge-Builder" and quoting ''[[Le Monde]]'' that dubbed him the "architect of Greek-Turkish rapprochement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papandreou.gr/papandreou/content/Document.aspx?d=6&amp;rd=7739474&amp;f=1354&amp;rf=1290836267&amp;m=3822&amp;rm=22164866&amp;l=1|title=George A. Papandreou Personal Site|publisher=Papandreou|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a founding member of the [[Helsinki Citizens Assembly]].

==Party leadership==
In anticipation of the 2004 national elections in Greece, polls indicated that PASOK was very likely to lose as the conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party was heading towards a landslide. In January 2004, the incumbent PM [[Costas Simitis]] announced his resignation as leader of PASOK, and passed the leadership to Papandreou by recommending him as the new leader. On 8 February 2004 PASOK introduced for the first time the procedure of open primaries for the election of party leadership. Even if Papandreou had no opponent, this was a move designed to solidify the open primaries, democratize the party, and make a clean break with the tradition of "dynastic politics."

In May 2005, Papandreou was elected Vice President of the [[Socialist International]] following a proposal by the former President, [[António Guterres]]. In January 2006, Papandreou was unanimously elected President of the Socialist International.

In the [[Greek legislative election, 2007|2007 general election]], PASOK again lost to the incumbent [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party of [[Kostas Karamanlis]] and Papandreou’s leadership was challenged by [[Evangelos Venizelos]] and [[Kostas Skandalidis]]. Papandreou, however, retained his party's leadership at a [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement leadership election, 2007|leadership election]] in November.

In June 2009 and under his leadership, his party won the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Greece)|2009 European Parliament election in Greece]].&lt;ref name="European election results 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ekloges-prev.singularlogic.eu/e2009/pages/index.html?lang=en|title=European election results 2009 for Greece|work=Results of the 2009 European Elections|publisher=Ministry of Internal Affairs|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four months later, PASOK won the [[Greek legislative election, 2009|October 2009 general elections]] with 43.92% of the popular vote to [[New Democracy (Greece)|ND]]'s 33.48%, and 160 parliament seats to 91.&lt;ref name="Results 2009 Greek legislative elections"&gt;{{cite web|title=Greek legislative election, 2009 results |url=http://ekloges.ypes.gr/pages/index.html?lang=en |work=Results of the 2009 Greek legislative elections |publisher=Ministry of Internal Affairs |accessdate=6 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610163929/http://ekloges.ypes.gr/pages/index.html?lang=en |archivedate=10 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taking office and revelations===
The inauguration of George Papandreou as the 182nd [[Prime Minister of Greece]] took place on 6 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8292278.stm|title=Papandreou sworn in as Greek PM |date=6 October 2009|work=BBC News  |accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon inauguration, Papandreou's government revealed that its finances were far worse than previous announcements, with a [[budget deficit|year deficit]] of 12.7% of GDP, four times more than the [[Eurozone]]'s limit, and a [[public debt]] of $410&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1964443,00.html|title=Greece Bailout: France, Germany Angry Over Rescue|date=16 February 2010|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This announcement served only to worsen the severe crisis the Greek economy was undergoing, with an [[unemployment rate]] of 10%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8510386.stm|title=Greece's unemployment rate hits 10%|date=11 February 2010|work=BBC News  |accessdate=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the country's [[debt rating]] being lowered to BBB+, the lowest in the Eurozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1946594,00.html?iid=sphere-inline-sidebar

===Crisis management and bailouts===
On 23 April 2010 during a visit at the island of Kastelorizo, Papandreou issued a statement to the press that he instructed Finance Minister [[Giorgos Papakonstantinou|Papakonstantinou]] to officially ask the EU partners to activate the support mechanism, 'an unprecedented mechanism in the history and practice of the [[European Union]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papandreou.gr/papandreou/content/Document.aspx?d=6&amp;rd=7739474&amp;f=1722&amp;rf=-1850948134&amp;m=12893&amp;rm=20504593&amp;l=1|title=George A. Papandreou: Personal Site |publisher=Papandreou|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The support mechanism, which was put in place by the European heads of state and government and further elaborated by [[Euro Group]] ministers, is a European mechanism to which the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] is associated with financing and it involves a comprehensive three-year economic program and financing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/tr/2010/tr042510.htm|title=Transcript of a Press Conference by George Papaconstantinou, Finance Minister of Greece|date=25 April 2010|work=IMF|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 23 April 2010, [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]], the Managing Director of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) announced that Greece made a request for a [[IMF Stand-By Arrangement|Stand-By Arrangement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2010/pr10168.htm|title=Statement by IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn on Greece|date=23 April 2010|work=IMF|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Papandreou and his Finance Minister [[Giorgos Papakonstantinou]] managed to convince the IMF and EU to participate in a [[Greek government-debt crisis#Rescue packages provided by the EU and IMF|€110bn bailout package]] on 9 May 2010.  Greece's [[sovereign debt crisis]], which is considered part of the [[European sovereign debt crisis]], is marked by [[2010–2011 Greek protests|massive strikes and demonstrations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ametroepeia.pblogs.gr/2011/11/o-kybos-errifthh-alea-jacta-est-and-shit-has-hit-the-fan.html|title=wrath of the People|publisher=Mike Kamateros}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an opinion poll published on 18 May 2011, 77% of the people asked said they had no faith in Papandreou as Prime Minister in handling the [[Greek government debt crisis|Greek economic crisis]].&lt;ref name="Public Issue"&gt;{{cite web|title=Μνημόνιο ένα χρόνο μετά: Αποδοκιμασία, αγανάκτηση, απαξίωση, ανασφάλεια (One Year after the Memorandum: Disapproval, Anger, Disdain, Insecurity) |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/169875/mnimonio-ena-hrono-meta-apodokimasia-aganaktisi-apaxiosi-anasfaleia/ |publisher=skai|accessdate=18 May 2011|date=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May 2011 the [[Real Democracy Now! (Greece)|Real Democracy Now!]] movement [[2010-2011 Greek protests|started protesting]] in Athens and other major Greek cities. At the time, the peaceful protests were considered to be a sign of popular rejection of Mr. Papandreou and his government's economic policies,&lt;ref name="BBC parliament camps"&gt;{{cite news|title=Inside the Greek parliament protest camp |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13900005|work=BBC|accessdate=24 June 2011|date=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC cuts"&gt;{{cite news|title=Greece austerity: PM Papandreou tries to persuade MPs|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-13877932|work=BBC|accessdate=24 June 2011|date=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with as much as three quarters of the Greek population being against the policies of the Papandreou government.&lt;ref name="BBC EU leaders"&gt;{{cite news|title=EU leaders urge Greek politicians to support new cuts|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13900008|work=BBC|accessdate=24 June 2011|date=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the demands of the demonstrations at Athens's central square, who claim to have been over 500,000 at one point,&lt;ref name="Skai 500,000"&gt;{{cite web|script-title=el:"Αγανακτισμένοι": Πρωτοφανής συμμετοχή σε Αθήνα και άλλες πόλεις |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/greece/article/171424/aganaktismenoi-protofanis-summetohi-se-athina-kai-alles-poleis-/ |publisher=skai|accessdate=24 June 2011|date=5 June 2011|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the resignation of Papandreou and his government.

In the early hours of 22 June, George Papandreou and his government narrowly survived a [[vote of confidence]] in the [[Greek parliament]], with 155 of the 300 seats in parliament.&lt;ref name="BBC confidence"&gt;{{cite news|title=Greek government survives confidence vote |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-13869428|work=BBC|accessdate=21 June 2011 |date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His government held 152 seats.&lt;ref name="Parliamentary Groups"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/Vouleftes/Ana-Koinovouleftiki-Omada/ |title=Βουλευτές – Ανά Κοινοβουλευτική Ομάδα|trans-title=MPs – By Parliamentary Group|publisher=Hellenic Parliament|accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 September, he cancelled a visit to the IMF building in Washington D.C and the [[UN Headquarters]] in New York City amid mounting concern over the country's debt crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greek crisis: PM George Papandreou cancels US visit|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14960216|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 September 2011|date=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opinion poll by Public Issue{{clarify|date=November 2011}} on behalf of [[Skai TV]] and [[Kathimerini]] in October 2011 showed that Papandreou's popularity had dropped considerably.&lt;ref name="Barometro Okt 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skai.gr/files/1/PDF/varometroskaitVoktober.pdf|title=Πολιτικό Βαρόμετρο 95 – Οκτώβριος 2011 |date=October 2011|publisher=Skai|accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the people asked, only 23% had a positive view of George Papandreou,&lt;ref name="Barometro Okt 2011"/&gt; while 73% had a negative opinion;&lt;ref name="Barometro Okt 2011"/&gt; ranking him lower than any other leader of a party in the [[Hellenic Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Barometro Okt 2011"/&gt; Papandreou also ranked low on the question of who is more suitable for Prime Minister, with just 22%, as both [[Antonis Samaras]] (28%) and "neither" (47%) ranked higher than him.&lt;ref name="Barometro Okt 2011"/&gt;

On 26 October 2011, the European Summit agreed to hand to the Greek government the Sixth [[Tranche]] of €8 billion bailout early in the 2012, while the private-sector banks, the holders of Greek debt, have agreed to a 50% [[Haircut (finance)|haircut]] on their outstanding Greek government bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eurozone crisis: banks agree 50% reduction on Greece's debt|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/27/eurozone-crisis-banks-50-greece|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=27 October 2011|location=London|first=David|last=Gow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 2011, during the national day parade, protesters blocked the parades, forcing the [[President of Greece]] and other officials to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greek protesters call president "traitor," halt parade|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/28/us-greece-protest-idUSTRE79R27O20111028|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Called-off referendum and stepping aside===

On 31 October, Papandreou announced his government's plans to hold a [[Greek proposed economy referendum, 2011|referendum]] on the acceptance of the terms of a [[eurozone]] bailout deal.&lt;ref name="Skai Dimopsifisma Papandreou"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/184900/dimopsifisma-kai-psifo-ebistosunis-zitise-o-prothupourgos-/ |title=Ρίσκα και αβεβαιότητες από την πολιτική "βόμβα" για δημοψήφισμα |trans-title=Risks and uncertainties by the political "bomb" for a referendum |publisher=[[Skai TV]]|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum was to be held in December 2011 or January 2012.&lt;ref name="Skai Dimopsifisma Venizelos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/184902/eu-venizelos-apo-to-neo-etos-to-dimopsifisma-/|title=Ευ.

On 5 November, his government only narrowly won a [[Motion of no confidence|confidence vote]] in parliament&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15604169 "Greek PM Papandreou faces unity challenge over bailout"] at bbc.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; and opposition leader [[Antonis Samaras]] called for immediate elections. The next day Papandreou met with opposition leaders trying to reach an agreement on the formation of an [[provisional government|interim]] [[national unity government]]. However, Samaras gave in only after Papandreou agreed to step aside, allowing the EU bailout to proceed and paving the way for [[next Greek legislative election|elections]] on 19 February 2012.&lt;ref name="unity"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/06/papandreou-greek-leaders-unity-deal |title=Papandreou out as Greek leaders agree unity government deal|last1=Kington|first1=Tom|last2=Smith|first2=Helena|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 November 2011|accessdate=6 November 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/greek-pm-george-papandreou-resigns;-polls-set-for-february/1/19851.html|title=Greek PM George Papandreou resigns; polls set for February |newspaper=Business Today|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[Communist Party of Greece|Communist Party]] (KKE) and the leftist [[Coalition of the Radical Left|SYRIZA coalition]] had refused Papandreou's invitation to join talks on a new unity government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political opposition divided over unity government|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_07/11/2011_413717|publisher=e.kathemerini|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several days of intense negotiations, the two major parties along with the [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] agreed to form a [[grand coalition]] headed by former Vice President of the [[European Central Bank]] [[Lucas Papademos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lucas Papademos named as new Greek prime minister|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-eing15671354|work=BBC News|accessdate=10 November 2011|date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 November, George Papandreou formally resigned as Prime Minister of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=George Papandreou resigns as Greece's prime minister|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8879647/George-Papandreou-resigns-as-Greeces-prime-minister.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=9 November 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Coalition Cabinet of Lucas Papademos|new coalition cabinet]] and Prime Minister Lucas Papademos were formally sworn in on 11 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Greek govt takes over, former banker at helm|url=http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2011-11-11-EU-Greece-Financial-Crisis/id-98805fa6da654460a141ba38be2d63e7|work=Associated Press|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comeback aspirations==
In August 2012, Papandreou was re-elected President of the [[Socialist International]] at its congress in [[Cape Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XXIV Congress of the Socialist International, Cape Town|url=http://socialistinternational.org/viewArticle.cfm?ArticleID=2179|publisher=[[Socialist International]]|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within domestic politics, he however remained largely sidelined within PASOK, while still an ordinary [[Member of the Hellenic Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/02/us-greece-politics-idUSKBN0KB0VD20150102|title=Former Greek PM Papandreou sets up new party, complicating election outlook|agency=[[Reuters]]|last=MacKenzie|first=James|date=2015-01-02|accessdate=2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 January 2015, Papandreou announced his aspirations to return to high-profile domestic politics. Launching his new party [[Movement of Democratic Socialists]] to contest the  [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|25 January 2015 parliamentary elections]], he confirmed the long-expected breakup with PASOK.&lt;ref name=wsj2jan&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/papandreous-return-to-politics-adds-a-wild-card-to-greek-election-1420224555|title=Papandreou’s Return to Greek Politics Adds New Wild Card to Election|last=Stamouli|first=Nektaria|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=2015-01-02|accessdate=2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While his decision was fiercely criticized by PASOK officials,&lt;ref name=wsj2jan /&gt; Papandreou referred to the extraordinary situation with the country facing important challenges amidst a highly polarized political situation. He said that under these circumstances he "needed to make a bold political choice. PASOK, the party I belonged to since my youth, and led for many years, had become assimilated into conservative practices and policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=George|last=Papandreou|title=A Note on Greek Elections and Our New Movement (KINIMA)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-papandreou/a-note-on-greek-elections_b_6542930.html|date=25 January 2015|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Receiving only 2.46% of the electoral vote, Papandreou's new party however fell short of the 3% [[electoral threshold]]. His failure to be reelected marks the first time since 1923 where a representative of the [[List of political families in Greece#P|Papandreou political dynasty]] is not present in the [[Hellenic Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Philip|last=Chrysopoulos|title=Papandreou Name Out of Parliament After 92 Years|publisher=[[Greek Reporter]]|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/01/26/papandreou-name-out-of-parliament-after-92-years/|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=10 February 2015|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election he said in a [[Newsnight|BBC Newsnight]] interview that his conscience was clear: "I was able to save Greece from default."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex Greek PM tells Newsnight: 'My conscience is clear'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31022170|date=28 January 2015|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, at the Congress of the Socialist International that took place in Cartagena, Colombia, Papandreou was unanimously re-elected President of the organization.

He is also co-chair of the [[Democratic Alignment (2015)|Democratic Alignment]], a coalition of the center left parties in Greece, composed by the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), the Democratic Left (DIMAR) and the Movement of Democratic Socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2017/01/13/former-greek-pm-papandreou-merges-kidiso-with-the-democratic-alignment|title=Former Greek PM Papandreou Joins Democratic Alignment|publisher=Greek Reporter|accessdate=8 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Papandreou delivered the keynote speech to the [[European Association of Political Consultants]] (EAPC) in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eapcevents.com/speakers|title=EAPC Brussels speakers|publisher=EAPC|accessdate=8 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/pro/newsletter/brussels-influence/politico-pro-brussels-influence-helping-the-pols-brussels-best-lobbyists-chemical-burn/|title=Pro Brussels Influence: Helping the pols|publisher=politico.eu|accessdate=8 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glasgow Empire Theatre Sauchiehall Street about 1930.jpg|thumb|Empire Theatre , Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow before the Art Deco changes of 1931]]
'''Glasgow Empire Theatre''', known as the Glasgow Palace Empire until the early 1900s, was a major theatre in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], which opened in 1897 on the site of the Gaiety Theatre at 31-35 [[Sauchiehall Street]].
It was one of the leading theatres in the UK chain of theatres owned and developed by [[Moss Empires]] under the chairmanship of Sir [[Edward Moss]], who served his apprenticeship in Greenock &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/GreenockTheatres.htm#lorne&lt;/ref&gt;
and elsewhere.

==Beginning and reopening==
The Empire Theatre &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/Empire.htm&lt;/ref&gt; was designed by the renowned theatre architect [[Frank Matcham]] for the [[Moss Empires]] theatre chain. [[Vesta Tilley]] topped the opening bill. Its predecessor the Gaiety Theatre &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/GaietyTheatre.htm&lt;/ref&gt; had opened in 1874 under Charles Bernard, staging pantomime, opera, musicals and plays but changed to variety, which Moss Empires developed further.

Expanding westwards towards Renfield Street and after a major Art Deco redesign by Sunderland-based architects [[W &amp; TR Milburn]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=202007&lt;/ref&gt; the Empire re-opened in 1931 with a seating capacity of 2,100. The main attraction on the re-opening was [[Jack Payne (bandleader)|Jack Payne]] and the [[BBC]] [[British dance band|Dance Band]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/glasgow-empire/theglasgowempirestory.htm|title=The Glasgow Empire story|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=202774|title=DSA Architect Biography Report|publisher=Dictionary of Scottish Architects|accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre attractions==
The Empire presented variety, revues, musicals and dance, including Pavlova, winter circus, pantomimes and ice spectaculars especially those produced by Tom Arnold.
Over the years many stars appeared including [[Lilly Langtry]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], Sir [[Harry Lauder]], [[G. H. Elliott]], [[Tommy Lorne]], [[Evelyn Laye]], [[Will Fyffe]], [[Harry Gordon (entertainer)|Harry Gordon]], [[Robert Wilson (tenor)|Robert Wilson]], the Logan family and [[Andy Stewart (musician)|Andy Stewart]]. Dance bands included [[Jack Hylton]] and [[Joe Loss]].
Top quality American artistes were greatly welcomed, including [[the Andrews Sisters]] and [[Billy Eckstine]]. [[Fats Waller]] made his European debut in the Empire in 1938. [[Tony Bennett]], [[Johnnie Ray]], [[Frankie Laine]], [[Connie Francis]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Howard Keel]], [[Guy Mitchell]], [[Mel Tormé]] and [[Liberace]] were joined by [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dorothy Lamour]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Jack Benny]] and a great favourite [[Danny Kaye]].

Welsh singer Dame [[Shirley Bassey]] made her debut at the theatre in 1959 and was initially given a hard time before asking the audience to give her a chance, whereupon the singer finished her set and was warmly applauded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/music-news/2009/11/01/dame-shirley-bassey-still-going-strong-after-notorious-scots-debut-78057-21789772/ |publisher=Daily Record |title=Dame Shirley Bassey going strongly after tough Scots debut |accessdate=29 March 2011 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Empire was notorious within showbiz circles as ''"The English comic's grave"'', if their act was slow or thin. Among those judged this way were [[Bob Monkhouse]], [[Tommy Cooper]], [[Bernie Winters]] and [[Morecambe and Wise]]. [[Des O'Connor]] pretended to faint when the Glasgow audience started jeering his act and was duly dragged off stage. [[Roy Castle]] survived because of his versatility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ua1zluoDxjwC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=glasgow+empire+theatre&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1uAJTrTvGNSy8QOr37GTAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=glasgow%20empire%20theatre&amp;f=false|title=Footprint Glasgow Handbook:The Travel Guide|author=Alan Murphy, Rebecca Ford|year=2001|page=131|publisher=Footprint Handbook Ltd|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian Ken Dodd famously disparaged attempts to psychoanalyse humour with the rebuttal, "The trouble with [[Sigmund Freud]] is that he never played second house at the Glasgow Empire after both halves of the [[Old Firm]] had just lost!"

The record for the longest running shows is held by The Andy Stewart Show, twice-nightly with a change of programme each six weeks, for 26 weeks in 1961 and again in 1962, with 400,000 tickets sold each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/Empire.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final curtain==
The final curtain came down on the theatre on 31 March 1963 with a cast that included the Red Army Choir, [[Duncan Macrae (actor)|Duncan Macrae]], [[Robert Wilson (tenor)|Robert Wilson]], [[Iain Cuthbertson]], [[Albert Finney]], [[Rikki Fulton]] and [[Andy Stewart (musician)|Andy Stewart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glasgow-empire.webs.com/thefinalcurtain.htm|title=Glasgow Empire Theatre|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is now occupied by Empire House, an office and retail development, at the corner of West Nile Street and 31-35 Sauchiehall Street.

'''''Halakhak Komiks''''' (literally, "[[Guffaw]] [[Comics]]" or "[[Laughter]] Comics") is the first regularly published [[Philippine comics|comics]] magazine in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; Its first publication was on November 15, 1946.&lt;ref name=Halakhak1&gt;[http://komiklopedia.wordpress.com/2007/12/27/halakhak-komiks-gallery/halakhak1/ Halakhak Komiks Gallery » Halakhak Komiks No.1 by Komiklopedia on 2009/09/21]&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by Filipino illustrator [[Isaac Tolentino]] and Filipino lawyer [[Jaime Lucas]].&lt;ref name=WP&gt;[http://komiklopedia.wordpress.com/2007/04/03/halakhak-komiks-1946-1947/ Halakhak Komiks by Komiklopedia on 2007/04/03]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Halakhak Komiks was a regular weekly ''[[comic strips|funnies]]'' or ''[[funny pages]]'' comic book that was established after the [[Second World War]] through the suggestion of Isaac Tolentino to Jaime Lucas, the owner of a newly established bookstore known as Universal Bookstore located at [[Azcarraga Avenue]] (now known as [[Claro M. Recto Avenue]]) in the Philippines. At the time, Tolentino (a former cartoonist for ''T-V-T'' before World War II) was looking for a job. Lucas, an admirer of Tolentino’s talent, agreed and accepted Tolentino’s idea because publishing a regularly issued comics-magazine had never been done before in the Philippines. Lucas funded the initial publication of the comics by utilizing his own money and bank loans. Tolentino summoned his pre-war cartooning colleagues.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

The printing of the initial issue (''Halakhak Komiks #1'') was commissioned to the Carmelo and Bauermann, Inc. The office of Halakhak Komiks was located at #665 Evangelista, [[Quiapo, Manila]]. Among the Filipino cartoonists who contributed to Halakhak Komiks were [[Tony Velasquez]], Damy Velasquez (brother of Tony Velasquez), J.M. Perez, Elmer Abustan, Gene Cabrera, [[Francisco V. Coching]], Liborio Gatbonton, Fred Carillo, [[Francisco Reyes (illustrator)|Francisco Reyes]], [[Jose Zabala Santos]], Hugo Yonzon, [[Larry Alcala]], Pedro Coniconde, and Lib Abrena.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

Initially priced at 25 [[Philippine centavo|centavos]] (Philippine [[céntimo]]) per copy, Halakhak was published with 42 pages that were half the size of a regular [[bond paper]] due to shortage of paper after World War II. Later on, it was published as a regular-sized [[comic book]] at 40 [[centavo]]s per copy. Halakhak Komiks was published in ten issues before the company closed due to the naiveté of the managers in the comic book business, financial difficulties, ineffective distribution and advertising strategies, and non-paying comic book agents and distributors.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

==Regular comic strips==
Halakhak Komiks #1 featured [[comic strip]]s such as Isaac Tolentino’s ''Mga Hindi Sukat Akalain'' ("Unexpected Things") and ''Geslani'', Gene Cabrera’s ''Eto na si Tibo'' ("Here Comes Tibo"), Jose Zabala Santos’ ''Si Pino'' ("Pino"), Francisco Reyes’ ''Talahib'' ("Cogon Grass"), Liborio Gatbonton’s ''Doon daw sa Langit'' ("It is said that in Heaven..."), Francisco V. Coching’s ''Bulalakaw'' ("Comet"), Damy Velasquez's and [[Jesse Santos]]' ''Kidlat'' ("Lightning"), A. Roullo’s ''Kasikoy'', Noly Panaligan’s ''Binong'', [[Cris CaGuintuan]]’s ''Eniong Bohemio'', Hugo Yonzon’s ''Teryong Alat'' ("Teryo the Salty"), and Maning de Leon’s ''Indo''.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

==Regular serials==
Among the regular serials that were featured in the pages of Halakhak Komiks included Dumlao’s ''[[Bernardo Carpio]]'' (1947), Francisco V. Coching’s ''Bulalakaw'' (from 1946 to 1947), Cris CaGuintuan’s ''Eniong Bohemio'' (from 1946 to 1947), Isaac Tolentino’s ''Mga Hindi Sukat Akalain'' and ''Geslani'' (both from 1946 to 1947), Jose Zabala Santos’ ''Kani-Kaniya nga Naman'' ("It Is Really To Each His Own") (from 1946 to 1947), Damy Velasquez’s and Jesse F. Santos’ ''Kidlat'' (from 1946 to 1947), Larry Alacala’s ''[[Siopawman]]'' (1947), and Francisco Reyes’ ''Talahib'' (from 1946 to 1947).&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

'''Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims''' is one of the National Memorial Halls in [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]].

==Overview==
The Hall was founded by the Japanese national government to mourn the atomic bomb victims in 2002. It was designed by [[Kenzo Tange]].  There is [[Nagasaki National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims|another National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] built for the same purpose.

The Hall is in [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]] near [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial]] across the "Motoyasu River" by "Motoyasu Bridge".  The Hall curators are collecting atomic bomb memories and stories from the survivors to mourn the victims, as the survivors are aging. They are also collecting names and photographs of atomic bomb victims for the same purpose and for the same reason. From the collection, they are developing a project to "read the stories of the atomic bombing".

Admission is free of charge.

The '''Kent and Dollar Farm massacres''' was one of the earliest [[massacre]]s of [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] civilians carried out by the [[LTTE]] during the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. The massacres took place on 30 November 1984, in two tiny farming villages in the district of [[Mullaitivu]] in north-eastern Sri Lanka.The Dollar and Kent Farm killings were the first attack by the Tigers on civilians.&lt;ref name="pirapaharan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sangam.org/articles/view2/?uid=633|title=Pirapaharan (Volume 2, Chapter 23)|last=Sabaratnam|first=T|date=2004|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backdrop to the events==

The Kent and Dollar farms were located near Manal Aru a divisional Secretariat in the Tamil district of Mullaitivu. Manal Aru was of immense importance since it was situated on the border of three districts Mullaitivu, Trincomalee and Anuradhapura and more importantly was the sole gateway between the North and the Eastern parts of the island where the Tamil community was the majority.

Realizing its strategic importance and in a bid to quell the rising threat of Tamil Nationalism, Manal Aru was renamed as Weli Oya (Sinhalese translation of the Tamil name) and an attempt was sought to colonise the area.

A total of 13,288 Tamil families living in 42 villages for generations including Kokkulai Grama Sevakar Division (1516 Tamil families), Kokku –Thoduvai Grama Sevakar Division (3306 Tamil families), Vavunia North Grama Sevakar Division (1342 Tamil families), Other Divisions of Mullaitivu District including Naiyaru and Kumulamunai ( 2011 Tamil families) were asked to vacate their homes and farmlands within 48 hours to clear the area from unauthorized land-grabs. Most of these families were settled in these areas by the government to the resentments of the neighboring landless Sinhalese majority. The families included those of Sinhalese ex-convicts who had served time for minor crimes like illegal alcohol brewing, thuggery, and intimidation.&lt;ref name="pirapaharan"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously land given to 14 Tamil entrepreneurs, including Kent Farm and Dollar Farm, on 99 years lease was also cancelled and taken over by the government.

The Slaw enforcement agencies did translate its warning and used force. From 1988–89 Sinhalese villages in Weli Oya was put on a war-footing. A total of 3364 families, most of them landless peasants, were settled in Weli Oya. A further 35,000 persons comprising 5, 925 families were also settled under the same scheme.

==Attack by the LTTE==

Tamils were pained and incensed by the eviction of the Indian Tamil labourers from the Kent and Dollar Farms and by the harassment meted out to the Tamils of the nearby traditional villages. They lost faith on the reasonableness of the Sinhala leaders.

About 50 LTTE cadres travelled in the night in two buses armed with rifles, machine guns and grenades. One of the buses sped to Dollar Farm and the other to Kent Farm. The attacks was timed to start at about the same time in the early hours of the morning.
The LTTE fighters shot and hacked the guards, the women and children and most of the male members of the families. Some of the prisoners were thrust into a room in a building and blasted with explosives. Sixty-two Sinhalese including three jail-guards were killed. The second bus proceeded to the Kent Farm eight kilometres away and killed 20 more home guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2009/05/29/fea50.pdf|title=LTTE genocide at Kent and Dollar Farms|date=29 May 2009|accessdate=30 October 2014|publisher=Daily News|location=Sri Lanka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police and the troops conducted a cordon and search operation and the government announced that the troops had killed 30 terrorists.

==Casualties==

The death toll of Sinhalese civilians killed by the LTTE attack numbered 62 males, mostly armed home guards or ex-convicts settled.The LTTE hacked large numbers of women and children as well.

'''LibrePlanet''' (literally, "Free Planet") is a community project created and supported by the [[Free Software Foundation]]. Its objective is the promotion of [[free software]] around the world by bringing every year an international conference to local communities&lt;ref&gt;[https://libreplanet.org/wiki/LibrePlanet:Teams LibrePlanet teams]. Teams are groups in various cities and towns across the world that host local meetups and conferences and other events.&lt;/ref&gt; and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://libreplanet.org/wiki/LibrePlanet2011 Planète Libre 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The project was born in 2006, at a gathering of members associated with the Foundation and the will to organize into geographical groups. The [[wiki]] serves as the primary portal for people who want to become involved in [[free software|free software activism]] in local, [[grassroots]] modes of cooperation.

==LibrePlanet conference==

The conference is organized annually by the [[Free Software Foundation]] in or around [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and staffed by a mixture of foundation staff and community volunteers. The conference replaces the FSF Annual Members Meeting (AMM) which ran around the same time each year.

Each conference has its own theme and a website. The event typically includes a speech from FSF president, [[Richard Stallman]] and FSF executive director [[William John Sullivan|John Sullivan]], as well as members of the wider free software community.

The five-day festival is held in the first half of November. It offers a programme of contemporary composed music, jazz and improvisation, avant-garde world music, sound installations, electronic music, modern opera, music theatre, and interdisciplinary performances. Concerts are staged in different venues.

== History ==
The first  November Music took place in 1993. There is an ongoing collaboration with various international festivals. In recent years, November Music has also organised concerts outside the scope of the festival in other Dutch cities.

Furthermore, groups like [[Kronos Quartet]], [[Arditti Quartet]], [[musikFabrik]], [[Asko Ensemble]], [[Nederlands Kamerkoor]] and [[Raschèr Saxophone Quartet]] gave presence at November Music.

November Music regularly links up Dutch jazz musicians with improvisators from other countries and arranges a first get-together on stage. Some combinations initiated by November Music: [[Yuri Honing]] and [[Craig Taborn]], Wolfert Brederode and [[Mark Feldman]], [[Vijay Iyer]] and [[Misha Mengelberg]], [[The Bad Plus]] and Anton Goudsmit, [[Marc Ribot]] and ZAPP4, Martin Fondse and [[Matthew Herbert]], ZAPP4 and [[Jan Bang]], [[Rembrandt Frerichs]] Trio and [[Kayhan Kalhor]].

===Sound art installations===
Since 2012 November Music also has a [[sound art]] program. Initially organized by sound artist Horst Rickels. Since 2016 sound art organisation [[iii]] became the curator of a special line-up featuring [[sound installation]]s and [[sound sculpture]]s. [[Pierre Bastien]] (among others) was part of the 2016 line-up in this program. The 2017 edition had programmed [[Yuri Landman]], [[Mariska de Groot]] and [[Dmitry Morozov]] (aka Vtol) and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://novembermusic.net/programma/installatie-expeditie-kruithuis-2017&lt;/ref&gt; This program happens in the [[Kruithuis]], a 1620 built military [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]].

'''''Obama on my Mind''''' is a musical play about the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]] of [[Barack Obama]] by British crime writer and film producer [[Teddy Hayes]].

The play, a musical comedy, is a campaign story set the week after the [[2008 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;President Obama Inspires London Musical, Lisa Auret, Special to CNBC.com | 27 Feb 2009 [https://www.cnbc.com/id/29426325]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Musical Obama On My Mind to Premiere in London, By Mark Shenton, 20 Jan 2009, Playbill {{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/125386.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224033740/http://playbill.com/news/article/125386.html |archivedate=February 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews were strongly negative. Lyn Gardner, a British reviewer wrote a critical review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' after having seen the show at the Hen and Chickens Theatre where the musical made its debut to mostly sold out crowds, describing the musical as "opportunistic", and as a "bizarrely unfocused text - an apparently unedited stream of consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/mar/07/theatre ''Obama on my Mind,'' Lyn Gardner, ''The Guardian'', Saturday 7 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

However one year later the play was taken to Seattle Washington and staged at the Langston Hughes Theater where it was positively reviewed, championed and supported by African American audiences as a piece of entertainment that reflected both the humour as well as all of the events surrounding the jaw dropping surprise of an African American being elected as US president. The Broadway World described the play as a "politically inspired comedic romp featuring a motley crew of loyal, obsessive and downright peculiar personalities, striving to get their candidate into the White House."

The '''Oregon Shakespeare Festival''' ('''OSF''') is a regional [[Repertory|repertory theatre]] in [[Ashland, Oregon]], United States.  Each year, the Festival produces eleven plays, usually from three to five by Shakespeare and the remainder by other playwrights, on three stages during an eight-month season beginning in mid-February. From its inception in 1935 through the end of the 2017 season (excepting the war years 1941–1946) the Festival has presented all 37 of Shakespeare's plays a total of 312 times and beginning in 1960, 341 non-Shakespeare plays for a total of over 30,000 performances. It has completed the complete Shakespeare canon of 37 plays in 1958, 1978, 1997, and 2016.&lt;ref name="images"&gt;{{cite book | last=Leary | first=K. | title=Images of America: Oregon Shakespeare Festival | location=Charleston | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival welcomed its millionth visitor in 1971, its 10-millionth in 2001, and its 20-millionth visitor in 2015. A complete list by year and theater is available at the ''Main article:'' [[Production history of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival]].

==Overview==
[[File:OSFAerialView.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Elizabethan and Bowmer Theatres during a "Green Show" (see below)]] A season at OSF consists of a wide range of classic and contemporary plays produced in three theatres. Three plays are staged  in the outdoor Allen Elizabethan Theatre, three in the Thomas Theatre, and five in the Angus Bowmer Theatre. OSF also provides a broad range of educational programs for middle schools, high schools, college students, teachers, and theatre professionals. While OSF has produced non-Shakespearean works since 1960, each season continues to include three to five Shakespeare plays.  Since 1935, it has staged [[List of Shakespeare plays|Shakespeare's complete canon]] three times, completing the first cycle in 1958 with a production of ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' and completing the second and third cycles in 1978 and 1997.  Since 2000, there has also been at least one new work each season from playwrights such as [[Octavio Solis]] and [[Robert Schenkkan]].

Each year, the Festival offers 750 to 800 performances from February through late October or early November, to a total audience of about 400,000. The company consists of about 675 paid staff and 700 volunteers.&lt;ref name=Festival&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=The People of OSF: Our Company Members | url=http://www.osfashland.org/about/people/index.aspx | publisher= Oregon Shakespeare Festival | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oregon Shakespeare Festival is listed as a Major Festival in the book ''Shakespeare Festivals Around the World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gregio | first=Marcus | title=Shakespeare Festivals Around the World | publisher=Xlibris Corporation | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

==Green Show==
In addition to the plays, beginning in 1951 a free outdoor "Green Show" drawing audiences of 600 to 1200, often including non-playgoers, has preceded the evening plays from June through October from a modular steel stage with a sprung floor for the dancers, a removable wheelchair ramp for performers with disabilities, and built-in storage facilities that eliminate carting equipment from and to distant storage facilities six days a week. Originally, it offered [[Elizabethan]] music and dancers. From 1966 till 2007, it consisted of three Renaissance-themed shows in rotation inspired by the plays showing in the Allen Elizabethan Theatre.  Live music was supplied by the Terra Nova Consort and other guest musicians and modern dance was performed by Dance Kaleidoscope. In 2008, the Green Show was revamped. The nightly shows now vary widely with performers such as a dance group from Mexico or India one night, clowns doing ballet on stilts the next, and a classical music quartet on another. A fire show, juggler, or magician might be seen along with improv, metal, or rock-n-roll variations on Shakespeare. Individual performers, groups, choirs, bands, and orchestras may present Afro-Cuban, baroque, blues, classical, contemporary, cowboy, funk, gospel, hip-hop, jazz, mariachi, marimba, poetry, marionette, renaissance, or salsa, sometimes combined in unexpected ways.&lt;ref name="images" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Show&gt;{{cite web | title= OSF Announces New Green Show | url=http://www.dailytidings.com/2008/0531/stories/0531_valley_greenshow.php| publisher=Ashland Daily Tidings | date=2008-05-31 | accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite web | author=Varbel Bill. | title=Many Colors in Newly Revamped Green Show | url=http://www.dailytidings.com/2008/0609/stories/0609_greenshow.php| publisher= Ashland Daily Tidings | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:OSF Green Show Stage.jpg|thumb|right|A Performance on the OSF Green Show stage]]

==History==
In 1893, the residents of Ashland built a facility to host [[Chautauqua]] events. In its heyday, it accommodated audiences of 1,500 for appearances by the likes of [[John Philip Sousa]] and [[William Jennings Bryan]] during annual 10-day seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Murphy | first=M. | title=The Stage is Set for a Meteoric Success. ''A Tradition of Shakespeare 1935–2005'' | work=Ashland Daily Tidings | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, a new domed structure was built at the site, but it fell into disrepair after the Chautauqua movement died out in the 1920s. In 1935, the similarity of the remaining wall of the  then roofless Chautauqua building to [[English Renaissance theatre#Theatres|Elizabethan theatre]]s inspired [[Southern Oregon University|Southern Oregon Normal School]] drama professor [[Angus L. Bowmer]] to propose using it to present plays by Shakespeare. Ashland city leaders loaned him a sum "not to exceed $400" (approximately equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|400|1935|r=-2}} in 2014) to present two plays as part of the city's [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebration. However, they pressed Bowmer to add boxing matches to cover the expected deficit. Bowmer agreed, feeling such an event was in perfect keeping with the bawdiness of [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan theatre]], and the performances went forward. The [[Works Progress Administration]] helped construct a makeshift Elizabethan stage on the Chautauqua site,&lt;ref name="osfab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osfashland.org/about/archive/angus.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314043821/http://www.osfashland.org/about/archive/angus.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and confidently billing it as the "First Annual Oregon Shakespearean Festival", Bowmer presented ''[[Twelfth Night, or What You Will|Twelfth Night]]'' on July 2 and July 4, 1935, and  ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' on July 3, directing and playing the lead roles in both plays himself.&lt;ref name="osfab" /&gt; Reserved seats cost $1, with general admission of $.50 for adults and $.25 for children (approximately equivalent to $17, $8.50 and $4.25 in 2014). Ironically, the profit from the plays covered the losses the boxing matches incurred.&lt;ref&gt;Oregon Shakespeare Festival Archives.  Used with the permission of Amy Richard, Media Relations, OSF: media@osfashland.org&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Festival has continued ever since (excepting 1941–1946 while Bowmer served in World War II), and quickly developed a reputation for quality productions. Angus Bowmer's first wife Lois served as art director, creating both costumes and scenery during the formative years of the Festival from 1935 to 1940 years.&lt;ref name="images"/&gt; In 1939, OSF took a production of  ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' to the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] in [[San Francisco]] that was nationally broadcast on radio. The lead actress, learning at the last minute the broadcast would be to a national audience,  suffered a panic attack, was rushed to the hospital and the stand-in took over. The scripts didn't arrive on the set until three minutes before air time. The Festival achieved widespread national recognition when, from 1951 to 1973, NBC broadcast abbreviated performances each year that were carried by more than 100 stations and, after 1954 on Armed Forces Radio and Radio Free Europe. The programs won favorable review from critics and people began to come from around the country. The programs led Life magazine to do a story on the Festival in 1957, bringing even more people to the plays. The NBC programs and the subsequent attention go a long way to explaining the mystery of how a tiny out-of-the-way timber town in the Northwest became a theatrical and tourist Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Darling | first=John | title=This is OSF...on NBC | work=Ashland Daily Tidings| date= August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bing Crosby]] served as an honorary director of the festival from 1949 to 1951. [[Charles Laughton]] visited in 1961, saying "I have just seen the four best productions of Shakespeare that I have ever seen in my life." Laughton begged to play King Lear, but died in 1962 before he could fulfill the dream. [[Stacy Keach]] was a cast member in 1962 and 1963. [[Duke Ellington]] and his orchestra presented a benefit concert in 1966 that brought many luminaries to Ashland.&lt;ref name="images" /&gt;

1952 saw the birth of the tradition of closing the outdoor season with a ceremony in which many of company members enter the darkened theater carrying candles and a company member selected for the honor speaks Prospero's words from Act IV Scene I of the Tempest beginning, "Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and Are melted into air, into thin air…" On completion of the speech all extinguish the flames and file silently out of the theatre.&lt;ref name="images" /&gt;

The tradition of opening the outdoor season with a Feast of Will (initially the Feasting of the Tribe of Will) was initiated in 1956 in [[Lithia Park]] with [[Miss Oregon]] and then state senator [[Mark Hatfield]] attending.&lt;ref name="images" /&gt;

The [[Portland, Oregon|City of Portland]] approached OSF in the late 1970s about joining the art scene there, leading to the building of a new center in Portland. In 1986, OSF was again approached about producing in the new [[Portland Center for the Performing Arts]], leading to the launch in November 1988 of a season of five plays including Shaw's ''[[Heartbreak House]]'' and Shakespeare's ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'', the first of four productions that transferred to or from Ashland. At the invitation of the [[Portland, Oregon|City of Portland]], OSF established a resident theatre in the [[Portland Center for the Performing Arts]] in 1988 that spun off to independence in 1994 as [[Portland Center Stage]]. Those six seasons ran from November–April, allowing many company members to work in both cities. In 1990-1991 Portland imported rotating repertory from OSF, a company of 10 actors performing 43 roles.&lt;ref name="images" /&gt;

In 1986, the Festival received the President's Volunteer Action Award; in 1987 it initiated Daedalus, a fundraiser to help victims of HIV/AIDS that has continued annually ever since.&lt;ref name="images" /&gt;
 
A second theatre, the indoor Angus Bowmer Theatre (see below), opened in 1970, enabling OSF to expand its season into the spring and fall; within a year, attendance tripled to 150,000. [[Angus L. Bowmer]]retired in 1971, and leadership of the Festival passed to [[Jerry Turner (theater director)|Jerry Turner]], a respected actor/director and later a translator of [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[August Strindberg]], who served as artistic director until 1991. He widened the Festival repertory to production of classics by the likes of Molière, Ibsen, and Chekhov. By 1976, the festival was filling 99% of its seats while offering some 275 performances of eight plays each season. In 1977, the Festival opened a third theatre, dubbed the Black Swan (see below), in what originally was an auto dealership, and attendance reached 300,000. By 1979, the year that Bowmer died, the Festival was producing 11 plays a season, the number that has been standard ever since. In 1983 OSF won both its first Tony Award for outstanding achievement in regional theatre and the National Governors' Association Award for distinguished service to the arts, the first ever to a performing arts organization.&lt;ref name="images" /&gt;

The Oregon Shakespearean Festival was renamed the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 1988. Turner retired in 1991 and actor/director [[Henry Woronicz]] took control from 1991 to 1996. When Woronicz left in 1996, OSF recruited [[Libby Appel]] from the highly respected [[Indiana Repertory Theatre]], and a guest director at OSF from 1988 to 1991. She served as Artistic Director from 1996 through 2007.  In 1997, the OSF-commissioned ''[[The Magic Fire]]'' was presented at the [[John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts|John F. Kennedy Center]] and named by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' among the year's best plays. In 2002, the Thomas Theatre (see below) replaced the Black Swan as the venue for small, experimental productions in a [[Black box theater|Black box theatre]]. In 2003, ''Time'' named OSF as the second best regional theatre in the United States (Chicago's [[Goodman Theater]] was first).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Zoglin | first=Richard | authorlink=Richard Zoglin | title=Bigger than Broadway! | work=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,454479-2,00.html |  date= May 27, 2003 | accessdate=May 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bill Rauch as artistic director==
Current Artistic Director [[Bill Rauch]] succeeded Appel in 2008.  Rauch was the co-founder and artistic director of the [[Cornerstone Theater Company]] in Los Angeles and had been a guest director at OSF for six seasons prior to his appointment.  His vision includes making direct connections between classic plays and contemporary concerns, incorporating musicals into the annual selection of plays, exploring beyond the [[Western canon]] to incorporate Asian and African epics into the Festival, and reaching out to youth. While continuing to work with established playwrights, he has commissioned works by new ones, and has initiated the Black Swan Lab to develop new works for the stage. Each year, ten OSF actors are assigned to the Lab to work with Bill Rauch, OSF Dramaturg Lue Douthit, and Producer Sarah Rasmusen as one of their regular repertory assignments. In recognition of his work, he received the [[Margo Jones]] Award for his impact on American theatre in 2009 and the 2018 Ivy Behune Award from Actors Equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=OSF's Bill Rauch honored by Actors' Equity for diversity efforts | work=Ashland Daily Tidings |url=http://www.dailytidings.com/news/20180124/osfs-bill-rauch-honored-by-actors-equity-for-diversity-efforts |  date= January 24, 2018 | accessdate=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Bill Rauch.png|thumb|Bill Rauch in the Allen Elizabethan Theatre during one of the informal post-matinee talks]]

Inspired by Shakespeare's canon of plays, Rauch initiated a 10-year program to commission of up to 37 new plays collectively called ''American Revolutions: the United States History Cycle''. Under the direction of Alison Carey, the plays look at moments of change in America's past. Grants from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], the [[Collins Foundation]], the Edgerton Foundation, the Harold and Mimi Steinberg Trust, and the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation support American Revolutions. Through December 2016, 32 plays have been commissioned and ten of these have reached the stage, beginning with ''American Night: The Ballad of Juan Jose'' (2010). It was followed by ''Ghost Light'' (2011); ''The March'' (2011 at [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company]]); ''Party People'' and ''[[All the Way (play)|All the Way]]'' (2012); ''The Liquid Plain'' (2013); the sequel to ''All the Way'', ''The Great Society'' (2014, commissioned by and co-produced with [[Seattle Repertory Theatre]]), ''[[Sweat (play)|Sweat]]'' (2015), ''Indecent'' (2015 at [[Yale Repertory Theatre]] and [[La Jolla Playhouse]]; 2016 at [[Vineyard Theatre]]; 2017 on Broadway), and ''Roe'' (co-produced with [[Arena Stage]] and [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre]]).

Through December 2014, ''All the Way'' has received seven awards including co-winner of the inaugural 2013 Edward M. Kennedy Prize for Drama Inspired by American History; the 2014 [[Tony Award for Best Play]], the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play]], the [[Drama League Award|Drama League Award for Outstanding Production of a Broadway Play]], the [[Outer Critics Circle Award|Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding New Play]], the [[Elliot Norton Awards|Elliott Norton Award for Outstanding Production by a Large Resident Theatre]], and the [[IRNE Awards|IRNE Award for Best New Play]], Large Theater. In addition, the 2014 [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play|Tony Award for best actor]] went to Bryan Cranston&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=12 Stars Who Won Tony Awards for their Broadway Debut Performances | url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/news/articles/2015-04-13/201504131428983400506.html?promo=rss|website=Tonyawards.com | date=May 20, 2015 | accessdate=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his portrayal of Lyndon Johnson in the Broadway production of ''All the Way''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= | first= | title=OSF Sets New AMERICAN REVOLUTIONS Commissions | url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/portland/article/OSF-Sets-New-AMERICAN-REVOLUTIONS-Commissions-20150430# | date= April 30, 2015 | accessdate= 2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partnerships with [[Arena Stage]], [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre]], Center Stage, Company One, [[Guthrie Theater]], [[Penumbra Theatre Company]] Playwrights Center, [[The Public Theater]], [[Seattle Repertory Theatre]] and [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company]] ensure that the plays will reach beyond their original OSF audience.

In February 2018, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival announced that Rauch would be leaving after completing the 2019 season to become artistic director of the new Perelman Center at the World Trade Center in New York.

==Play On!==
Columbia University Professor [[John McWhorter]] has pointed out that Shakespeare's language is no longer entirely ours. Granted, he says, with the help of notes and time to study them, you can work out the sense of some of the obscure dialogue, but not in a theatre in a matter of seconds while the action speeds by and the actors deliver the lines with all the urgency of the moment then move on. Its time, goes the argument of many scholars, for versions that will do for a contemporary English-speaking public what has been done for much of the world where Shakespeare is performed in the native language of the audience—make every word intelligible.&lt;ref name="playon"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osfashland.org/experience-osf/upcoming/play-on.aspx | title=Play On! | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Play on! is an OSF project being carried out by 36 playwrights paired with dramaturgs working in concert with 17 different theatres and academic institutions commissioned to translate all 39 plays attributed to Shakespeare into contemporary modern English by 31 December 2018. Each playwright is asked to respect the language, meter, rhythm, metaphor, image, rhyme, rhetoric, and emotional content of the original. The goal is 39 unique side-by-side companion translations that are both performable and useful reference texts for classrooms and productions.&lt;ref name="playon" /&gt;

While each playwright will take his or her own approach, Kenneth Cavander, the playwright who undertook and completed this task for ''Timon of Athens'' felt that the trick was to leave what is immediate and alive to our ears in the original untouched and only elsewhere to unpack whatever might hinder the free flow of the story in a way that is clear, not over-reverent, and above all, actable, so that the result is clear and compelling to a contemporary audience while preserving the spirit of the original.&lt;ref name="playon" /&gt;

==Economic importance==
In 2013, 108,388 individuals bought 407,787 tickets, seeing an average of 3.76 plays each. Of these, 92,234 people were visitors to the area spending $54,534,565 beyond the price of their theater tickets.  Added to the $32,233,543 in actual Festival expenditures, the direct contribution to the local economy in 2013 was $86,768,108.  In 2015, 103,946 individuals bought 390,380 tickets, seeing an average of 3.3 plays each. Of these, 88,784 people were visitors to the area spending $55,332,927 beyond the price of their theater tickets. Added to the $35,182,783 in actual Festival expenditures, the direct contribution to the local economy in 2015 was $90,515,710. The estimated total contribution based on the multiplier effect brought total impact to $251,627,515 in 2013 and to $262,495,558 in 2014. The multiplier effect measures how often each dollar received is spent partly on further local goods and services. For OSF, 2.9 is the estimated multiplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Press Releases and Information | url=http://www.osfashland.org/en/press-room/press-releases.aspx | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | year=2014 | accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cwi | first=D.| title=Economic Impacts of Arts and Cultural Institutions | publisher=National Endowment for the Arts | year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attendance in 2014 at 794 performances of eleven plays was 398,289, 88% of capacity. Attendance in 2015 at 786 performances of eleven plays was 390,387, 87% of capacity.  In 2017, overall attendance at 795 performances was 381,378, 82% of capacity, generating $21.9 million in ticket sales. The difference was accounted for by the eight fewer scheduled performances, variations in seating configurations, cancellation of five outdoor performances in 2015 and of nine outdoor performances in 2017 due to smoke from forest fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Varble, B. | title=OSF draws more than 390,000 Patrons in 2015 season | url=http://www.dailytidings.com/article/20151105/NEWS/151109915/ |publisher=Ashland Daily Tidings | year=2015 | accessdate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Darling, J. | title=That's A Wrap | url=http://www.dailytidings.com/news/20171108/thats-wrap | publisher=Ashland Daily Tidings | date=November 8, 2017 | accessdate=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Festival hosted the fifth biennial national Asian American Theater Conference and Festival. In addition to a full slate of conference sessions during the week, the event included six original plays, five play readings, and three Green Shows (see above). Participants also had an opportunity to see several regular Festival performances, two of which had an Asian setting and one an Asian-American theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Roberts | first=Dmae | title=Asian Americans take center stage at national theater festival, conference in Ashland | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/art/index.ssf/2016/09/asian_american_theater.html | publisher=The Oregonian | year=2016 | accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==OSF campus==
The Oregon Shakespeare Festival occupies a {{convert|4|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus adjacent to [[Lithia Park]] and the Plaza in Ashland, Oregon. The primary buildings are the three theatres, Carpenter Hall, and the Camps, Pioneer, and Administration buildings, all surrounding an open central court, locally known as "The Bricks" that ties everything together into an architecturally coherent whole and facilitates movement. It also provides a stage for the nightly Green Shows (see above) from June through September.  Other facilities include the Black Swan, which serves as a laboratory for the development of new plays, the production facility, the costume shop, classrooms, and the Hay Patton Rehearsal Center. Other buildings are off campus.

===Allen Elizabethan Theatre===
The Allen Elizabethan Theatre has evolved since the founding of the Shakespeare Festival when the first performance of ''Twelfth Night'' was presented on July 2, 1935.

====Original Elizabethan Theatre====
The design for the first outdoor OSF Elizabethan Theatre was sketched by [[Angus L. Bowmer]] based on his recollection of productions at the University of Washington in which he had acted as a student. [[Ashland, Oregon]] obtained WPA funds in 1935 to build it within the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} high circular walls that remained in the roofless shell of the abandoned [[Chautauqua]] theatre. Bowmer extended the walls to reduce the stage width to fifty-five feet, and painted the extensions to resemble half-timbered buildings. He designed a thrust stage—one projecting toward the audience—with a balcony. Two columns helped divide the main stage into forestage, middle stage, and inner stage areas. Illustrating the improvised nature of it all, actors doubled as stage hands, stage lighting was housed in coffee cans, and string beans were planted along the walls to improve sound quality! Fifty cent general admission seating was on benches just behind the one-dollar reserved seating on folding chairs. This theatre was torn down during World War II.&lt;ref name="Bowmer"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bowmer | first=Angus | title=Shreds and Patches: The Ashland Elizabethan Stage | location=Ashland, Oregon | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Association | year=1978 | oclc=6040869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second Elizabethan Theatre====
The second outdoor Elizabethan Theatre was built in 1947 from plans drawn up by [[University of Washington]] drama professor John Conway. The main stage became trapezoidal, with entries added on either side, and windows added above them flanking the balcony stage.  A low railing gave a finished appearance to the forestage. Chairs arranged to improve sight lines replaced bench seating. Backstage areas were added gradually and haphazardly, until the ramshackle result was ordered torn down as a fire hazard in 1958.&lt;ref name="Bowmer"/&gt;

====Current Allen Elizabethan Theatre====
[[File:Elizabethan Theatre 2014.jpg|thumb|The outdoor Allen Elizabethan Theatre at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival]]The next year saw the opening of the current outdoor theatre, whose name was changed from Elizabethan to Allen Elizabethan Theatre in October, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  title=The Paul G. Allen Family Foundation Awards OSF $3,000,000 Grant | url=http://osfashland.org/press-room/press-releases/allen-grant.aspx | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patterned on London's 1599 [[Fortune Playhouse|Fortune Theatre]] and designed by  [[Richard L. Hay (scenic designer)|Richard L. Hay]], it incorporated all the stage dimensions mentioned in the Fortune contract. The trapezoidal stage was retained but the façade was extended to three stories, resulting in a forestage, middle stage, inner below, inner above (the old balcony), and a musicians' gallery. The wings were provided with second-story windows.  Each provides acting areas, creating many staging possibilities. A pitched, shingled roof enhances the half-timbered façade. A windowed gable was extended from the center of the roof to cover and define the middle stage. Just before each performance, an actor opens the gable window, and in keeping with Elizabethan tradition signaling a play in progress, runs a flag up the pole to the sound of a trumpet and doffs his cap to the audience.

The result is an approximate replica of the Fortune Theatre. The known but incomplete dimensions apply only to the stage. The original specifications sometimes say no more than "to be built like the Globe," for which there are no plans or details. The remotely operated lighting, on scaffolding on either side of the stage, of course did not exist in the original and the current site rather than the original architecture determines the shape of the auditorium. Twelve hundred seats in slightly offset arcs ascend the original hillside, giving an excellent view of the stage from each seat. The old Chautauqua theatre walls, now ivy-covered, remain as the outer perimeter of the theatre.

The $7.6 million [[Paul Allen]] Pavilion was added in 1992. It houses a control room, and audience services including infrared hearing devices, blankets, pillows and food and drink, which are allowed in the auditorium.  Several hundred seats were moved to a balcony and two boxes, further improving sightlines and acoustics. Vomitoria (colloquially "voms"), the traditional name for entryways for actors from under the seating area, were added and the lighting scaffolds were eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association.

Each year, three plays are offered in rotation Tuesdays through Sundays in the Allen Elizabethan Theatre from late June to early October.

===Angus Bowmer Theatre===
[[File:Bowmer theatre ashland.jpg|thumb|right|Angus Bowmer Theatre in 2013]]An April 1968 report by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research of the [[University of Oregon]] pointed to the lost opportunity represented by turning away thousands of people by the Oregon Shakespeare Festival each year. It further noted that the Festival had become an important economic engine for southern Oregon, and recommended addition of an indoor theatre. This led the [[Ashland, Oregon|City of Ashland]] to apply to the [[Economic Development Administration]] of the [[Department of Commerce]] in Fall 1968 for a $1,792,000 project grant with the Angus Bowmer Theatre as the keystone. The plan also called for a parking building, a remodeled administration building and box office, a scene shop and exhibit hall that later would become the OSF Black Swan, landscaping, and street realignment. $896,000 was approved in April 1969, to match an equal amount to be raised through private donations. The fund drive quickly exceeded its goal and ground for the new theatre was broken on December 18, 1969.

The theatre was ready just five months later and opened with a production of ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]],'' selected to recognize the Shakespearean origin of the Festival but to signal that the Festical also was ready to broaden its horizons by incorporating modern plays into its repertoire. Reinforcing that signal, ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' and ''You Can't Take it with You'' were also presented during that first six-week season.

The Angus Bowmer Theatre seats between 592 and 610 patrons depending on configuration.  Although about half the size of the outdoor theatre, it more than doubled audience capacity by making it possible to hold matinee performances and to extend the season into spring and fall.

The design by [[Richard L. Hay (scenic designer)|Richard L. Hay]] with architects Kirk, Wallace and McKinley of Seattle and contractor Robert D. Morrow, Inc., Salem, Oregon was at once basic, flexible, functional and innovative. All seats are within {{convert|55|ft|m}} of the stage, arranged with only two side aisles and wide spaces between rows. Dark colors resist reflection and draw the eye to the stage. The forestage is on a hydraulic lift system that can emulate the thrust stage of the OSF Allen Elizabethan Theatre, form a more conventional proscenium front, move below auditorium floor level to form an orchestra pit, or drop two stories for storage of equipment or scenery. The walls of the auditorium can swing in to close down the playing area or open to accommodate larger productions.&lt;ref&gt;Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association. ''Stage II''. Ashland, Oregon: Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:OSF Bowmer Theater Set for Fences.jpg|thumb|left|Angus Bowmer Theatre set design by Scott Bradley for August Wilson's ''Fences''. Photo by Jenny Graham.]][[File:OSF Bowmer Theatre Set for Claycart.jpg|thumb|right|Angus Bowmer Theatre set design by Christopher Acebo for ''The Clay Cart''. Photo by Jenny Graham.]]

Illustrating these characteristics, the first picture is the set for August Wilson's ''Fences''. The second, taken two hours later, is the set for the ancient Hindu classic ''The Clay Cart''. Stage crews for the two indoor theatres must complete set changes of this scope six days a week between the end of a matinee and the "call" before the evening curtain (the outdoor stage changes daily). This illustrates the nature of true repertory theater, which allows the playgoer to see different plays on the same day on the same stage, but requires designing and making sets to withstand constant rapid assembly, disassembly and return to accessible storage to await the next change of set.

In what then Executive Director Paul Nicholson called the biggest crisis in the history of the Festival, a crack was discovered in the seventy-foot long, six and one-half foot high main ceiling support beam of the Bowmer Theatre two hours before the 18 June 2011 matinee. Shows were immediately relocated to other venues as work progressed to repair the beam. A 598-seat tent, "Bowmer in the Park", was erected as a temporary replacement venue. A single set was designed and built to serve four very different shows, and the shows themselves were re-staged while keeping the artistic vision of each as intact as possible. Thirty-one performances were given in the tent and averaged 82% of capacity generating approximately $650,000 in revenue against approximately $800,000 for the tent itself, $1,000,000 in lost revenue from ticket returns, and $330,000 in repair costs. The Bowmer reopened on 2 August, a month ahead of the initial estimate. The Festival filed an insurance claim for $3.58 million and received checks in March 2012 for $330,000 to cover the cost of repairs and $2.984 million covering much of the lost revenue, leaving about $200,000, primarily representing the cost of the temporary tent theater itself, unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Galvin | first = R |title = Bowmer Re-opening for August 2 | url = http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110717/NEWS/107170343/-1/rss01 | work = Medford Mail Tribune | date = July 17, 2011| accessdate = August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Hathaway | first = Brad |title = Temporary Nomads with Tent No More | url = http://livedesignonline.com/news/0802_oreegon_shakespeare | date = August 2, 2011 | accessdate = August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hayden | first=D | title=Bowmer in the Park: Anatomy of a Crisis | location=Ashland, Oregon | publisher=Sneak Preview 22, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Hugely | first = Marty | title = Oregon Shakespeare Festival Re-opens Bowmer Theatre, and Tallies the Losses | url = http://www.oregonlive.com/performance/index.ssf/2011/08/oregon_shakespeare_festival_re_4.html|website=Oregonlive.com | date = August 2, 2011| accessdate = August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Wheeler | first = Sam |title = 'Bowmer in the Park' Begins  | url = http://www.dailytidings.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110708/NEWS02/107080304 | work = Ashland Daily Tidings | date = July 8, 2011| accessdate = August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Wheeler | first = Sam |title = OSF collects $2.6 million in insurance from Bowmer closure  | url = http://www.dailytidings.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120310/NEWS02/203100306/-1/NEWS| work = Ashland Daily Tidings | date = March 10, 2012| accessdate = May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black Swan===
The Black Swan (G on the OSF campus map above) served as the Festival's third theatre from 1977 to 2001. The building, originally an [[Car dealership|automobile dealership]], was bought in 1969 as a [[scene shop]] and rehearsal hall. Company members began using it to stage "midnight" readings for one another. They invited friends who brought other friends. Artistic Director Jerry Turner recognized the opportunity to take risks with unconventional staging and subjects, and called for its development as a third OSF theatre. Fitting a theatre into the existing building was challenging. It could hold only 138 seats, all within five rows of the stage. There had to be, as designer Richard Hay put it, a "certain amount of tucking and squeezing." Each director had to solve the problem of an immovable roof support in the middle of the stage. For instance, in one production, it became a [[crucifixion]] after a horizontal piece added, .  The theatre reverted to its earlier roles in 2002 when it was replaced by the New Theater, now renamed the Thomas Theatre.  Among those roles are rehearsal space, meeting and audition rooms, classes, and since 2011 as a home for the Black Swan Lab (see above).

===Thomas Theatre===
[[File:Thomas Theater at OSF.jpg|thumb|right|The arena seating and set for Macbeth, directed by Libby Appel, which was the opening performance in the Thomas Theatre.]]The limitations stemming from adapting an existing building as the Black Swan led to the design and building of a third theatre that provided flexible seating and increased capacity while maintaining the intimacy of the Black Swan.&lt;ref name="images" /&gt; Opened in March 2002 and originally named the '''New Theatre''', it was renamed the Thomas Theatre in 2013 as a result of a generous $4.5 million gift from a group of donors. The name is in recognition of long-time OSF development director Peter Thomas who died in March 2010. The Thomas Theatre expands the possibilities for experiment and innovation while maintaining the intimacy of the Black Swan, no seat being more than six rows from the stage. [[Richard L. Hay (scenic designer)|Richard L. Hay]] designed the theatre space. Architects Thomas Hacker and Associates of Portland designed the building. The contractor was Emerick Construction, and acoustical engineering was provided by Dohn and Associates. The seats can be arranged in three configurations. In arena mode, a stage of {{convert|663|ft2|m2}} is surrounded on all four sides by 360 seats. In three-quarter thrust mode, a {{convert|710|ft2|m2|adj=on}} stage is surrounded on three sides by 270 seats, and in avenue mode, a {{convert|1236|ft2|m2|adj=on}} stage provides 228 seats on two sides. There is a [[trap room]] under the stage and a [[fly loft]] at one end. A computer controls 300 circuits and over 400 lights of various types. The remainder of the building is given over to downstairs and upstairs lobbies, concessions, access distribution, archives (see below), storage, laundry room, [[green room]], quiet room, warm-up room, dressing space for 18 actors, showers/restrooms, costume and wig rooms, [[stage manager]]'s office, maintenance space, and storage for props and set pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Conrad | first=Chris | title='New' No More |url=http://www.dailytidings.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120317/NEWS02/203170304 |website=Dailytidings.com|  date=17 March 2012 | accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other buildings===
The Box Office (J on the OSF campus map above) is on the same courtyard as the Thomas Theatre. The Festival acquired the Administration Building (C) in April 1967. Forming the northern boundary of the campus, the building houses the Group Sales Office (D), artistic, business, communication, education, human resources, development, community productions, mailroom, and an annex to the costume shop. The Festival Welcome Center (E), on the northern side of the building facing Main Street, offers information about OSF and Ashland, houses a small rotating exhibit of costumes from past shows, and adjoins the [[Margery Bailey]] Room, otherwise known as the Education Center. The adjacent Camps Building (A) houses the members' lounge, marketing offices, and a meeting room.

Just off the courtyard, the Pioneer Building houses the Festival's costume shop. The staff of over 60 creates the costumes and accessories in three main studios on the lower floor of the building and in an extension of the Administration Building.&lt;ref name=Festival/&gt; Also in this area are offices and fitting rooms for the costume designers and costume design assistants, a costume props area and a vented paint room. Upstairs is a dye room, lounge, laundry, storage room, and office. During the height of costume production each season, a wig shop and additional studio is open in the basement of the Angus Bowmer Theatre.

The Festival acquired Carpenter Hall (I) in October 1973, renovating it to accommodate lectures, concerts, rehearsals, meetings and Festival and community events. The Bill Patton Garden (K) provides the venue for free informal summer noon talks by OSF actors and staff. The Tudor Guild, a separate non-profit corporation, operates the Tudor Guild Gift Shop (B) and Brass Rubbing Center (K) where visitors can make rubbings of facsimiles of 55 historic English brasses under expert guidance. Just off campus, a purpose-equipped fitness center is staffed by two professional trainers who help prepare actors for physically demanding roles that often require acrobatics, fights, and pratfalls and monitored during additional open hours by a volunteer.[[File:OSF Production Facility in Talent.jpg|thumb|right|One aisle of the costume warehouse inside the new production facility of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival]]

The Festival completed a $7.2 million purpose-built {{convert|71,544|ft2|m2|adj=on}} production facility in neighboring Talent, Oregon, in November 2013 that is home to a multi-function staff of 40. The building houses custom-designed technologically advanced set and prop construction and scene painting facilities. The scene shop has an extensive pit area that precisely duplicates the trap doors in the theaters themselves, allowing for precise sizing, testing of assembly and disassembly, and automating elevator cues. Lighting in the painting areas duplicates that in the theaters, guaranteeing desired colors. The building also houses OSF's costume rental business, which has over 50,000 costumes and over 15,000 costume props such as armor, crowns, and wigs available for rent by other theaters, television and movie producers, and corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Kent | first=Roberta | title=OSF's Production Facility in Talent Is Complete | url=http://www.dailytidings.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20140312/NEWS02/403120303|work=Ashland Daily Tidings|date=March 17, 2014 | accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the removal of the scene construction shop in 2014 from its location in a building a block from the  Festival campus to the new Production Building (see above), a thirteen-month transformation began of the building into the Hay-Patton Rehearsal Center by demolishing everything except the masonry exterior and the steel framework and raising the second floor three feet. Following a plan developed by Ogden Roemer Wilkerson Architecture carried out by Adroit Construction at a cost of $4.4 million, it hosted its first rehearsal on 29 December 2015. The building is equipped with a sophisticated sound system and has six rehearsal halls, three of them some {{convert|3,000|ft2|m2|adj=on}}, sufficient precisely duplicate any of the three Festival theatres, and one which matches the Thomas Theatre stage. All six include fully sprung floors to protect actors' joints when dancing, rehearsing stage combat, or similar physical activities. The LED lighting system is zoned and dimmable, the ceilings have steel tracks which allow for suspension of scenery, lights, loudspeakers and even people.  Some have special features such as small conversation areas and dance-style mirrors. Other features include a stage management office, a recording studio, a movement studio focused on the [[Feldenkrais Method]], a voice studio for work on vocal technique, stamina, and dialect; a loading dock, a conference room, showers, two warmup spaces that double as small meeting rooms, two [[green room]]s equipped with refrigerator, storage cases, sink, dishwasher, and tables (custom-made by the prop shop) and chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aldous | first=Vickie | title=Oregon Shakespeare Festival dedicates new rehearsal center | url=http://www.dailytidings.com/news/20160229/oregon-shakespeare-festival-dedicates-new-rehearsal-center | publisher=Ashland Daily Tidings | date=2016-02-29 | accessdate=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=An Expansive New Space | url=https://www.osfashland.org/prologue/prologue-spring-2016/prologue-sp16-hay-patton-rehearsal-center.aspx | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | accessdate=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
OSF is a non-profit corporation managed under US and Oregon law by a 32-member Board of Directors nominated and elected for eight-year terms. The endowment has a net worth in excess of $30 million that returns about $1.2 million to support the annual operating budget. It is managed by seven trustees who are selected for five-year terms by the Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Kent | first=Roberta | title=OSF's Production Facility in Talent Is Complete | url=http://www.dailytidings.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20140312/NEWS02/403120303|work=Ashland Daily Tidings|date=March 17, 2014 | accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OSF is supported in part by corporate and individual donors through direct support of individual plays and annual non-voting memberships. These are offered at nine levels, each with its own privileges beginning with basic memberships for $75 which includes access to the member's lounge and a 10% discount in the Tudor Guild shop. Some 750 who contribute $1250-$2999 a year are designated Producer members, enjoying beyond all the benefits of the previous category, two complimentary tickets to plays, twice weekly coffees during which a cast member is interviewed, and three events each including three discussions on aspects of the year's productions and a dinner (at additional cost) with the actors.  Additional benefits accrue to 175 Producer's Circle members who contribute $3000-$5999 in a year, to upward of 80 Chautauqua Guild and Chautauqua members who contribute $6000-$24,999, while those contributing $25,000 or more annually join the Artistic Director's Circle at one of four levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | author=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | title=Member Presale Ordering Guide | date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 400 (many of whom also are annual members) who have supported the Festival through planned gifts are members of the Southampton Society, named for the Earl of Southampton who was Shakespeare's great patron. They are invited to one three-day event each season similar to the three for Producer members described above. Finally, some 150 people join the Bowmer Society annually providing partial support of the educational efforts of the Festival, described below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | author=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | title=Souvenir Program | date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional staff===
The OSF professional staff is organized into administrative, artistic, education, and production sections.

The administrative staff of approximately 125 is supervised by Executive Director Cynthia Rider (2013-) who follows Paul Nicholson (1995-2012) and William Patton (1955-1995). The Director of Finance and Administration supervises the physical plant (custodial services, maintenance, and security), accounting, mail room, and receptionists. The Director of Marketing and Communication supervises the box office, membership services, archives (see below), publications and media, marketing, and audience services, which itself includes house managers, ushers, concessions, and access staff for handicapped patrons (see below). The Director of Development supervises institutional giving and major gifts.  The Director of ITS manages information technology. The Director of Human Resources manages employees, volunteer and events programs (see below), safety, and a professional development program called FAIR (Fellowships, Assistantships, Internships, and Residencies) that provides students aspiring to a career in theater with direct experience of best practices across all aspects of professional theatre. Fellows work directly with senior management while expanding their personal networks. Three residencies varying from four to eleven months are exclusive to the Dramaturgy and Literary Management Department. Twenty-five to thirty Assistantships annually provide hands-on opportunities in virtually every area of the organization by pairing recipients with an appropriate OSF staff member for an average of three months. Finally, 15-20 unpaid Internships of two to four months annually provide emerging artists and administrators with hands-on experience by pairing them with a Festival staff member in the assistant's area of interest. Internships may fulfill academic requirements determined by recipient's home academic institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osfashland.org/work-with-us/FAIR-fellowships-internships-and-more.aspx |title=FAIR: Fellowships, Internships &amp; More |website=Osfashland.org |date=2016-07-01 |accessdate=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic Director [[Bill Rauch]] (see above) leads a staff consisting of approximately 450. The Artistic Director selects the plays and directors for each season, and chooses the actors, who number between 90 and 120, and the musicians and dancers who number approximately 25. The Associate Artistic Director, in turn, supervises scenic, lighting, and costume design, Fight Director and the [[dramaturg]]s.

A Voice and Text Director is assigned to every play from pre-production through the opening performance. OSF employs two full-time voice and text directors and one or two guest artists each year to meet the demand for these specialists. They help the actors and directors craft vocal choices that will be theatrically effective and sustainable through the run of the show. This can involve work on posture, breath support, resonant placement, muscularity of articulation and screaming technique. They also work with the actors on the text of the play, often in one-on-one sessions. This can include examination of meter, rhythm, sound patterning such as alliteration and rhyme, imagery, and rhetorical structure and devices such as antithesis and repetition. When required, they coach the actors in accents and dialects based on samples of native speakers and work with each actor to find a sound that is as authentic as possible to the character's background but also intelligible in a contemporary theatrical context and conducive to that individual's acting process.

Once the plays have opened, the resident voice and text staff is on hand to help actors with vocal challenges that may arise, attend periodic performances to give maintenance notes, work with understudies, teach voluntary voice classes to the acting company, provide ongoing professional development support in the form of project or individual session work, and participate in play selection and workshops for upcoming seasons.

The production staff of  approximately 125 is responsible for costumes, lighting, properties, scenery, sound, and stage operations. Costumes are produced by a staff of about 60 (artisans, cutters, designers, dyers, first hands, hair and wig specialists, stitchers, technicians, and wardrobe managers). Scenery is built by a staff of  technicians, carpenters, a welder, an engineer and a buyer and moved by a crew of 24 stagehands; lighting staff number eight, and sound and properties each are managed by staffs of six each. A production stage manager, eight stage managers and three production managers ensure the smooth operation of the three theatres and a deck manager coordinates the Green Show.

Reflecting the profession of Festival founder Angus Bowmer, a professor of English at the then [[Southern Oregon Normal School]] (now [[Southern Oregon University]]), education has played an important role at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival from its inception. Under the direction of Joan Langley, the full-time education staff of nine includes the director, both in-residence and outreach program managers and coordinators, a curriculum specialist, and resident teaching artists. The goal is to inspire a lifelong relationship to theater and the works of Shakespeare by offering educational experiences that support each season's plays to a diverse range of students, teachers, and audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osfashland.org/~/media/Files/PDF/Collections/M0020%20Education%20Department%20Records%2019472011.ashx |title=About Us |website=Osfashland.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the Festival provides a broad range of educational programs for a wide range of ages and interests. The initial focus was on college students and the Institute for Renaissance Studies was formed to meet their needs. The Festival offered short courses, lectures, readings, concerts, and exhibits focused on the plays of the season. Participation was open to all Festival company members and audiences, either for college credit from several universities, or for audit. Coursework was supported by a collection of Renaissance and late-medieval books, manuscripts, and prints now housed in the Southern Oregon University's Hannon Library.

Programs specifically for teachers include the weekend "Inside Shakespeare" and the five-day retreat, "Shakespeare in the Classroom" that emphasizes innovative and pedagogical methods to help teachers make the works of Shakespeare involving and accessible to contemporary students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osfashland.org/experience-osf/education/teacher-trainings.aspx |title=Teacher Trainings |website=Osfashland.org |date=2016-07-02 |accessdate=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The completion of the indoor Angus Bowmer Theatre in 1971 and the subsequent expansion of the Festival season into the school year enabled an increasing variety of educational programs for middle and high school students. Students visiting the Festival itself are the recipients of some 55,000 discounted tickets each year. Some 900 workshops offered each year by OSF actor-teachers enhance the educational value of their visits. The Bowmer Project for Student Playgoers (initiated in 1996) prepares local teachers to teach plays and includes tickets to a performance, a back-stage tour, and a post-show discussion with one of the actors. Each year since 1981, OSF has offered residential Summer Seminars for High School Juniors that enroll 65 students in a two-week program during which they see several plays and learn about on-stage technique and theatre management.

For those unable to come to the Festival, six pairs of actors participate in the School Visit Program, initiated in 1971, which now reaches some 60,000 students primarily in four states although it has made occasional visits to eight others. Each one-day visit includes two 50-minute performances and one two-hour or two one-hour workshops. Performances are a condensed version of one Shakespeare play, selected scenes from Shakespeare illustrating a single theme, or a combination of Shakespeare and other literature selected to meet the needs of the school being visited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lacaze |first=Katherine |url=http://www.mailtribune.com/article/20151130/NEWS/151139972 |title=OSF goes into classrooms across the state - News - MailTribune.com - Medford, OR |website=MailTribune.com |date=2016-09-30 |accessdate=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs of different lengths and formality to meet the needs and interests of adults include Wake Up With Shakespeare, Shakespeare Comprehensive, Festival Noons, Prefaces, Prologues, Park Talks, Road Scholars, and "Unfolding Seminars." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osfashland.org/experience-osf/education/public-events-classes.aspx | title=Public Events and Classes | accessdate=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, OSF's Development Department offers educational opportunities through its tours offered in late Fall, often on cruise ships such as [[Queen Mary 2]]. Past tours have included two to England focused on Shakespeare, one to Greece and Turkey focused on the beginnings and history of theater, and one along the coasts of France and Spain and to the Canary Islands.  These tours feature an intensive schedule of lectures and interactive workshops with four to eight OSF staff and actors, as well as visits to local attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osfashland.org/~/media/Files/PDF/Collections/M0020%20Education%20Department%20Records%2019472011.ashx |title=Oregon Shakespeare Festival : Archives Division : Education Department Records, 1947-2010 |website=Osfashland.org |accessdate=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access Service Program===
Audience Services offers a full range of programs and services for patrons with disabilities. For blind and visually impaired patrons, the Festival has six professional audio describers on staff who provide live audio description for every performance of every play with two weeks advance notice. Braille and large print playbills are available for all productions. Service animals are always welcome. For deaf and hearing-impaired patrons, six American Sign Language interpreted performances with highly trained interpreters are offered each season. Complimentary infrared listening devices and Telecoil hearing aid loops are available in all three of the Festival's theatres, and patrons may communicate with the Festival through the Oregon Telecommunications Relay Service. There is accessible seating in all performance venues, nearby accessible parking, and all of the above accommodations can be provided for the wide range of ancillary events that enrich the OSF experience, such as backstage tours, prefaces, prologues, and park talks. Each season a limited number of performances, post-show meet-and-greets, pre-show introductions, and backstage tours are open-captioned in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Accessibility  Services| url=http://www.osfashland.org/_dwn/plays/Access_Brochure_2011.pdf | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | year=2011 | accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archives===
The archivists develop, preserve, and maintain a comprehensive collection of documents and oral histories, drawings and photographs, audio and video recordings, and artifacts pertaining to the artistic and administrative history and heritage of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Collecting, organizing, and preserving these materials of what otherwise is an ephemeral art form to archival standards is an ongoing effort aided in part by a two-year grant from the National Historical Publications and Research Commission, with material added on an ongoing basis.

The archives are open Monday through Friday, 9AM to 5PM, and the staff invites any inquiry or reference question by phone or email. Researchers and the general public are welcome to visit the archives by appointment. Other collections are available for research, although some collections have restrictions, and permission must be obtained for their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  title=Our History | url=http://osfashland.org/about/our-history.aspx | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Archives | url=http://osfashland.org/en/about/archives.aspx | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Oregon Shakespeare Festival Archives | url=http://www.facebook.com/osfarchives | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archives include Education department records from 1947 on and document the department's programming and structural evolution. Print materials include annual reports, brochures, calendars, correspondence, course handouts, course readings, news clippings, newsletters, photographs, posters, scripts, statistics and survey reports, study guides, and teacher information kits, guides, and resource kits. Audio and video recordings include radio broadcasts and school visit program performances.

In May, 2013, the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] awarded the Festival a $200,000 grant to digitize 2649 deteriorating tapes, films and videos  and to make them publicly available through its website and the YouTube platform. The collection spans the history of the Festival from its inception in 1935 through 2012 and comprises an unparalleled and comprehensive record of Shakespearean and theatrical performance by a single U.S. theatre company. Included are full-length recordings of 541 of the 570 Festival productions from 1950 to 2012, including three or more varied interpretations of every play in the Shakespearean canon with exemplary casts before live audiences and the ballad opera series. The production recordings are supplemented by 44 adaptations broadcast on NBC radio, more than 100 hours of artist interviews, Shakespeare lectures by nationally and internationally renowned scholars and educators, production music, promotional recordings, and recordings of significant events in the company's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=$200,000 NEH Grant Supports Digitization | url=http://www.osfashland.org/press-room/press-releases/neh-grant.aspx | publisher=Oregon Shakespeare Festival | accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also included are the home movies of founder Angus Bowmer, Southern Oregon Normal School events and rare footage of the initial 1935 Festival season!

===Volunteers===
The professional staff is augmented by volunteers—approximately 700 contributing about 32,000 hours each year.  Tudor Guild volunteers staff the brass rubbing center, concession stands, and gift shop. Volunteers welcome visitors to the campus and answer their questions, staff the Green Show information table and welcome center, facilitate post-matinee discussions, provide concierge services for student groups, and supplement the professional ushers at all three theatres. Behind the scenes, volunteers help with office tasks such as preparing will-call tickets for pickup, sorting mail, filing, copying, mailings, and transcribing interviews. They work in the Archives, Costume Shop, Costume Warehouse, and Scene Shop, help with auditions, and serve as attendants in the company fitness facility. Among occasional tasks too numerous to provide a complete list, volunteers assist with access services and the periodic audience surveys, drive company vehicles, providing transportation for visiting dignitaries, and direct traffic during "strike" at the end of the season. Each year, company members present a thank you show titled ''Love's Labors'' for the volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Coombs | first=Mary | title=A huge cast of volunteers makes the show go on | url=http://www.dailytidings.com/article/20160302/NEWS/160309973/ | publisher=Ashland Daily Tidings | accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage Technology===
The availability of small inexpensive [[computing platforms]], [[LED]]s, and compact powerful batteries allows special effects to be built into props, costumes, and scenery. Lighting, atmospherics, sounds, even motorized movement can be programmed into devices and controlled by the actors or remotely. [[WiFi]] and [[Bluetooth]] devices allow for wireless communication between the control console and the effect. For example, the LEDs built into a dress can be remotely illuminated and colors changed live while on stage. Costumes in ''Head Over Heels'' (a musical by Lolita Snipes), ''[[The Wiz]]'', and ''The Winter's Tale'' are recent examples of wireless control. Lanterns, candles, fireflies, and other effects built into props and scenery also utilize embedded electronics.

The theatres feature [[Meyer Sound Laboratories|Meyer speakers]], [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] [[mixing console]]s, Clear-Com Freespeak wireless communication, [[Sennheiser]] wireless microphone systems and [[Qlab]] software playback for their theater spaces. The Elizabethan Theater underwent a major audio system re-design with Meyer Sound Laboratories in 2014. The install included various types of Mina [[line array]]s (UPQ-1Ps, UPQ-2Ps, MM4-Xps, 500 HPs, UPM-1Xps and UP-4Xps).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Stabler | first=David | title=Oregon Shakespeare Festival installs new, hopefully improved, sound system in outdoor theater | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/performance/index.ssf/2014/04/oregon_shakespeare_festival_in.html | publisher=The Oregonian | date= 2014-04-21 | accessdate=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
All playgoers are offered a complimentary [[Programme (booklet)|''Playbill'']] with a synopsis of the plays, cast lists, and directors' statements. All members receive 3 editions of ''Prologue'' each season (one each for spring, summer, and fall). This magazine contains selected articles on directors, actors, costumes, props, and plays each season.  Another publication that is made available at higher donor levels is ''Illuminations'', a comprehensive guide to each year's plays.  ''Illuminations'' includes synopses, themes, information on playwrights and historical and other contextual information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osfashland.org/membership/about/supporting.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612233423/http://osfashland.org/membership/about/supporting.aspx |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each year, the Festival publishes Teachers First! providing information on the season's plays including age suitability, the seasonal calendar, ordering and discount information.

The annual ''Souvenir Program.'' includes photographic highlights of each play and special articles along with pictures and biographies of actors, playwrights, and the many people who work behind the scenes. A chart emphasizing the repertory nature of OSF lists all the actors and their parts in the plays.

The Festival also publishes a ''Bard's Scorecard,'' which lists all of William Shakespeare's Plays, the years OSF produced them, and allows repeat patrons to cross off which plays they've seen towards completing the canon.

===Professional memberships===
OSF is a constituent of [[Theatre Communications Group]], the national service organization for the not-for-profit theatre world, and a member of the [[Shakespeare Theatre Association of America]]. It operates under contracts with [[Actors' Equity Association]], The Union of Professional Actors and Stage Managers in the United States, and the [[Stage Directors and Choreographers Society]], Inc., an independent national labor union.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4749">[[File:Playwrights-Company-1938.jpg|thumb|[[Maxwell Anderson]], [[S. N. Behrman]], [[Robert E. Sherwood]] and Elmer Rice, four of the five founders of the Playwrights' Company (1938)]]
The '''Playwrights' Company''' (1938–1960) was an [[United States|American]] theatrical production company.

==History==
[[Maxwell Anderson]], [[S. N. Behrman]], [[Sidney Howard]], [[Elmer Rice]] and [[Robert E. Sherwood]] 
established the Playwrights' Company in 1938 to produce their own plays. Anderson had been frustrated with [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] producers as well as drama critics. Anderson had stated the goal of the company “to make a center for ourselves within the theatre, and possibly rally the theatre as a whole to new levels by setting a high standard of writing and production,”. The founders had been unhappy with the policies of the [[Theatre Guild]] which had previously been their main producer. [[Robert Anderson (playwright)|Robert Anderson]], producer [[Roger L. Stevens]], [[Kurt Weill]] and lawyer [[John F. Wharton]] joined later. It became a major production company. The company was dissolved in 1960 as only two founders were still alive, Behrman (who had already left) and Rice. 

==Award==
After Howard's death, the four surviving members of the group created the [[Sidney Howard Memorial Award]] in his memory. The $1,500 award was created as a way to encourage new playwrights; to be eligible, one had to have at least one play produced on Broadway in a given season after having little previous success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=16 Matinees Today; Dowling's New Play; New Prize for Plays |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23105914/daily_news/ |work=Daily News |date=January 1, 1940 |location=New York, New York City |page=35|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = August 24, 2018}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roskilde Festival''' is a Danish [[music festival]] held annually south of [[Roskilde]]. It is one of the largest music festivals in Europe and the largest in Northern Europe. It was created in 1971 by two high school students, Mogens Sandfær and Jesper Switzer Møller, and promoter Carl Fischer.&lt;ref name="founders" /&gt; In 1972, the festival was taken over by the Roskilde Foundation, which has since run the festival as a non-profit organization for development and support of music, culture and humanism. In 2014, the Roskilde Foundation provided festival participants with the opportunity to nominate and vote upon which organizations should receive funds raised by the festival.

The Roskilde Festival was Denmark's first music-oriented festival created for [[hippies]],&lt;ref name="Christina Bilde"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jonsson|first=Kika|title=Interview: Roskilde Festival – "An experience that may change you forever"|url=http://nbhap.com/interviews/roskilde-festival-2013/|accessdate=23 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923074110/http://nbhap.com/interviews/roskilde-festival-2013/|archive-date=23 September 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and today covers more of the mainstream youth from Scandinavia and the rest of Europe. The Roskilde Festival 2013 had more than 180 performing bands and was attended by some 130,000 festivalgoers, along with more than 21,000 volunteers, 5,000 media people and 3,000 artists – totalling almost 160,000 people who participated in the festival.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Until the mid-1990s, the festival attracted mostly Scandinavians, but in recent years it has become more and more international (with an especially large influx of Germans, Australians and British).{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==History==
The first Roskilde Festival was held on 28 and 29 August 1971, originally named the '''Sound Festival'''. It was inspired by festivals and youth gatherings like [[Newport Jazz Festival|Newport]], [[Isle of Wight Festival|Isle of Wight]] and [[Woodstock]]. It was characterized mainly by poor management but also great enthusiasm. The festival's inaugural year saw roughly 20 bands ranging from folk, jazz, rock and pop genres all playing on a single stage, which lasted for two days with approximately some 10,000 visitors per day.&lt;ref&gt;Roskilde Festival: [http://roskilde-festival.dk/about_roskilde/history/ History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305015932/http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/about_roskilde/history |date=5 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, festival organizers acquired the ''Canopy Scene'', an orange musical stage previously used by The Rolling Stones on a European tour. Since its beginning, the Canopy Scene and its characteristic arches have become a well-known symbol and logo representing the festival.

In the 1990s, [[electronic music]] was introduced to the festival. In 1991, ''Club Roskilde'' was held, which was an electronic music dance club held in the evenings. In 1995, electronic music artists received their own stage. In the following years, even more room for electronic music was created by the establishment of the chill-out zone and the Roskilde Lounge. Since then, artists like [[Fatboy Slim]], [[The Prodigy]], [[Basement Jaxx]] and [[Chemical Brothers]] appeared on the main stage.

By the 1990s, the number of tickets offered for sale was restricted and later even reduced. Due to steadily increasing popularity of the festival, the number of visitors had increased to up to 125,000. In addition, 90,000 tickets for about 25,000 volunteers, 5,000 media people and 3,000 artists were added. In order to preserve the quality of the festival, the festival organizers decided to limit the number of participants. The distance from the rearmost part of the camping area to the stages of the festival management seemed to have become unreasonable. The festival had become so popular that the festival management decided in 1994 to expand the festival area to the west. The festival site was now on divided by the railway line into two parts. In 1996 the festival had its own station, which should facilitate the arrival of visitors. In 1997, another tent called ''Roskilde Ballroom'' was built.

==Stages==
[[File:Roskilde Festival - Orange Stage - Bruce Springsteen.jpg|thumb|Bruce Springsteen performing on the Orange stage]]
The bands presented at Roskilde Festival are traditionally a balanced mix of large, well-known artists, cutting-edge artists from all contemporary genres, popular crowd-pleasing acts plus local Scandinavian headliners and up-and-coming names.

The stages were until 2003 named after their colour, but as the names had not matched the actual color of the tents for a period, it was decided to rename all stages except the Orange Stage, the central and main stage. The Orange Stage is open in front of a huge field, whereas the other tents cover the whole audience, the largest of which is the Arena stage (formerly known as Green Stage), the largest tent in Europe with an official capacity of 17,000 people. The 2007 edition saw two new tents, replacing Ballroom (1997–2006) which presented mainly [[World music]], and Metropol (2003–2006) which presented mainly [[Electronica]]. In 2010 two stages, Astoria (from 2007) and Lounge, did not return, due to a slight shift in focus towards fewer, but bigger bands. In 2014 the Odeon stage was cancelled along with the surrounding sustainable-style food outlets, and the area was replaced with pre-booked tents for festival guests that prefer not to bring their own.

The music covers such styles as rock, Hip Hop, Metal, urban, electronica and 3rd world contemporary music. It has become a tradition to let a Danish act open the Orange Stage on the first day of the festival. There are often surprising performances by classical acts, film-music, opera etc.

Apart from music there is always some theatre and 'lone acts' wandering around the festival site. Terrain and tents are always decorated in various ways. The current tents are:

==Campsite==
The festival campsite covers nearly 80 [[hectares]] and access to it is included in the ticket price. It usually opens on Sunday morning prior to the festival itself. Apart from the small and separate ''Camping South'' it is divided into two areas, ''East'' and ''West'', each comprising a service center with establishments ranging from food stalls to a cinema. The campsite is further divided into 'agoras' that provide toilets, cell phone charging and luggage storage. They also host events according to each agora's theme: dance, skate, swim etc.

Over the most recent years, the opening of the campsite has turned into an event of its own; large areas of the campsite each year is turned into gravel pits which has increased demand for prime spots in the campsite. Thousands of people arrive during Saturday (some even arrive several days before), to wait in the queue until 16:00 that afternoon when the gates to the campsite officially open. Due to this, the festival has introduced temporary transit areas (in both ''East'' and ''West''), making it possible to let all these thousands of people get in at the same time. The last couple of years the fences around the transit areas has been knocked down several hours ahead of official opening by festival guests eager to get the spot for their tent.

In recent years, the fences into the camping site have been overrun earlier than the official opening. This is called "Væltning af hegnet" (The overturning of the fence). The festival has improved security at the fences up until the festival, but without success. Thus the camping site was overrun in 2008 and again in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/nyheder/singlenews/soendag-aften-blev-hegnet-til-campingpladsen-vaeltet-omkuld/ |title=Roskilde Festival: Nyhed |publisher=Roskilde-festival.dk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629154729/http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/nyheder/singlenews/soendag-aften-blev-hegnet-til-campingpladsen-vaeltet-omkuld/ |archive-date=29 June 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, a new gate system has been installed. This means that all guests arriving first fill 7 rows of the gate system (1000 people in each). Behind this, a large field holding all remaining guests. At 16:00 on the opening Saturday, the gates open, one row at a time at approx 90sec intervals. Once this is complete, the remaining guest in the back area are free to enter the camping area.

==Naked run==
Every year since 1999, on the Saturday of the festival (held on a Thursday in 2015, 2016 and 2017), Roskilde Festival Radio organizes a naked run around the camp site. One male and one female winner receive a ticket for the next year's festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chillisauce.co.uk/blog/naked-run-roskilde-festival/ |title={title} |access-date=29 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420013136/http://www.chillisauce.co.uk/blog/naked-run-roskilde-festival/ |archive-date=20 April 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past few years, the naked run has become so popular that the Festival Radio has been forced to arrange qualifier events for the male participants.

==2000 incident==
During [[Pearl Jam]]'s concert at the Orange Stage on 30 June 2000, a crush occurred. Nine people died, and twenty-six people were injured, three of them seriously. The dead included a 26-year-old cadet police officer from Hamburg, a 23-year-old Dutchman and three Swedes, two aged 22 and one 20. Three Danes, including a 17-year-old, also died. These nine victims died when they were [[stampede|crushed]] as the crowd rushed toward the stage.&lt;ref name="cphpost1"/&gt; The reasons for their deaths were examined by police, public prosecutors, and subsequent [[civil trial]]s, all of which determined that the causes were accidental. Many people fell down at one place; when they did not immediately get up, [[crowdsurfing|crowdsurfers]] fell into this "hole", and people at the bottom died of suffocation. On the day of the incident, there was also heavy rainfall, which could have contributed to the ground being slippery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://machinehead1.com/board_posts/pearl-jam-twenty]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207010028/http://machinehead1.com/board_posts/pearl-jam-twenty|date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time security guards in front of the stage got to the area of the accident after the music had been stopped, it was too late. As crowd surfing seems to have been among the precipitating factors, it was subsequently forbidden across most festivals in Europe.&lt;ref name="politiken1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/ECE2689/festivaler-forbyder-crowd-surfing/|title=Prohibition of crowd surfing|access-date=16 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006065546/http://politiken.dk/kultur/ECE2689/festivaler-forbyder-crowd-surfing/|archive-date=6 October 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}(Article in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year, the accident led to significant changes in safety procedures in order to avoid similar situations – not just at Roskilde Festival, but also at other festivals in Europe. Before the accident in 2000, Roskilde Festival was considered one of the safest festivals. Many other festivals have smaller safety systems than Roskilde Festival and revised their procedures even further. [[Glastonbury Festival]] in England chose to cancel its festival in 2001, in part to consider lessons from Roskilde, although mainly due to an influx of 150,000 non-ticketed visitors at its own 2000 event {{Citation needed|reason=2001 was Glastonbury's regularly scheduled fallow year|date=June 2018}}. Each year Roskilde Festival makes an extensive health and safety assessment on the basis of which the festival is executed. The accident at the Orange Stage led to the construction of a memorial ground on the festival site containing a stone with the inscription "How fragile we are" (a quote from the [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] song "[[Fragile (song)|Fragile]]") surrounded by nine trees.

Pearl Jam's song "[[Love Boat Captain]]" references the tragedy with the line "Lost nine friends we'll never know... two years ago today." When performed in concert, lead singer [[Eddie Vedder]] modifies the lyric to reflect the passage of time since the tragedy.

The 2010 festival officially opened with a memorial to those killed in 2000. [[Patti Smith]] held the short pre-concert ceremony, and she chose to open the tribute with accompanying music from [[Mozart]]. Her lead guitarist, [[Lenny Kaye]], then read out the nine men’s names while Smith threw nine roses into the crowd.&lt;ref name="cphpost1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cphpost.dk/culture/culture/122-culture/49378-roskilde-deaths-remembered.html|title=Roskilde deaths remembered|publisher=Cphpst.dk|accessdate=2014-05-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007105911/http://cphpost.dk/culture/culture/122-culture/49378-roskilde-deaths-remembered.html|archivedate=7 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9UiXOB48IU&amp;feature=related |title=pearl jam - eddie started crying before singing come back - berlin 30.6.2010 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419031310/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9UiXOB48IU&amp;feature=related |archive-date=19 April 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shows by bands such as [[Metallica]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Electric Eel Shock]], [[Coldplay]], [[Björk]], [[Massive Attack]], [[The Streets]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Queens of the Stone Age]], [[Urlaub in Polen]], [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]] and 150 more.

[[File:Roskildeiregnvejr.jpg|thumb|Orange Scene in 2004]]

===2004===
The 2004 festival featured artists such as [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[The Stooges|Iggy Pop and the Stooges]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Korn]], [[Pixies]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and [[Morrissey]]. [[David Bowie]] was scheduled to play at Roskilde 2004 but cancelled due to heart problems, with a notice on his website. Instead, [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], who were on tour in Europe, filled the spot.

Three rapes were reported (and no action was taken in 2005 to prevent further occurrences).&lt;ref name="crowdsafe.com - 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crowdsafe.com/new.asp?ID=1334|title=1 Dead, 3 Raped At Roskilde Festival|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527024516/http://www.crowdsafe.com/new.asp?ID=1334|archivedate=27 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crowdsafe.com - 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crowdsafe.com/new.asp?ID=1544|title=On The Fifth Anniversary Of The Roskilde Festival Tragedy, Organizers Face New Crowd Safety Criticism|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527031306/http://www.crowdsafe.com/new.asp?ID=1544|archivedate=27 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005===
{{main|Roskilde Festival 2005}}
The 2005 edition featured artists such as [[Audioslave]], [[Autechre]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[D-A-D]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Green Day]], [[Brian Wilson]], [[Fantômas (band)|Fantômas]], [[Kent (band)|Kent]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]] and more than 160 other bands and DJs. This year was also a huge contrast to the previous year on the weather front. Hot and sunny all week.

===2006===
[[File:roskilde festival 2006.jpg|thumb|Roskilde Festival 2006 – Kaizers Orchestra on Orange Stage]]
{{main|Roskilde Festival 2006}}
With more than 79,000 paying visitors (as well as approximately 20 000 volunteer day workers), the 2006 festival was the biggest in Europe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/object.php?obj=3d3000c&amp;code=1 Roskilde Festival Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702101748/http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/object.php?obj=3d3000c&amp;code=1 |date=2 July 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; for the year. With only one day of rain and the rest of the week being sunny, this festival also ranks as one with lucky weather conditions. Changes from the previous year included a new swimming lake – which proved to be very successful due to the warm and sunny weather – and a lounge stage called ''Bar'n''. Some of the performing artists were [[Bob Dylan]], [[Immortal Technique]], [[Roger Waters]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[The Strokes]], [[Deftones]], [[Morrissey]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Kanye West]], [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]], [[Bullet For My Valentine]], [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Sigur Rós]] and [[The Streets]]. Danish band [[Magtens Korridorer]] opened Orange Stage.

===2007===
{{main|Roskilde Festival 2007}}
Roskilde Festival 2007 turned out to be the wettest one yet, by a rather large margin.
Approximately 95&amp;nbsp;mm of rain fell during the course of the festival, as opposed to 44&amp;nbsp;mm in 1997, which was the wettest before 2007. Thursday was a day consisting only of rain, ending up with a lot of guests returning from the concerts to find their tents flooded. The organisers stated that it seemed that most of the people who left returned later on enjoyed a somewhat mixed weather experience Friday, and mostly dry, but a bit windy and chilly days on Saturday and Sunday.

The full programme was released on 19 April 2007 and included bands such as [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[Queens of the Stone Age]], [[Björk]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[The Who]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[The Killers]] and [[Tiësto]]. Danish band [[Volbeat]] opened Orange Stage.

Also Danish rock band [[Nephew (band)|Nephew]] played at Orange Stage on 7 July. This concert was later released as a live CD/DVD named 07.07.07 – this referring to the date of the concert. Danish rapper [[Liam O'Connor (Danish rapper)|L.O.C]] featured in the concert, where they also mixed their songs with other songs, e.g. singing a line from Rammstein's Amerika in the song USA DSB, and singing [[Black (English band)|Black]]'s [[Wonderful Life (Black song)|Wonderful Life]] in the beginning of [[Movie Klip]].

===2008===
{{main|Roskilde Festival 2008}}

Roskilde Festival 2008 was dry with the exception of a 10-minute shower on Saturday 5 July and rain that started around 22:00 on Sunday 6 July. The sun shone for the rest of the festival.

The full programme was released on 16 April 2008 and included [[Jay Z]], [[The Chemical Brothers]], [[Band of Horses]], [[Duffy (singer)|Duffy]], [[Kings of Leon]], [[Neil Young]], [[Radiohead]], [[Grinderman]], [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], [[Gnarls Barkley]], [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]], [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]], [[The Streets]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Slayer]], [[Tina Dickow]], and [[The Hellacopters]].

===2009===
{{main|Roskilde Festival 2009}}

Roskilde Festival 2009 was the hottest in 33 years according to the festival newspaper Orange Press. The festival was hit by a major cancellation, when rapper [[Lil Wayne]] had to cancel due to sickness. He was replaced by [[Gogol Bordello]] who played the only 6 starred concert at the festival. Orange stage was opened by Swedish rapper [[Petter Askergren|Petter]], who had prominent visitors on stage such as [[Dee Pee]] from [[Rockers by Choice]] and [[Liam O'Connor (Danish rapper)|L.O.C]], who was on Orange stage for the third year running (featuring on Nephew's Hospital in 2007, and his own concert in 2008). Petter has been called a failure for this concert, because he wasn't able to get a full crowd, and the opening of Orange has to be big.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=AF Anders Hjort |url=http://ibyen.dk/fokus/roskildefestival/article745247.ece |title=Svensker sparker halvtom Orange i gang |language=da |publisher=iBYEN.dk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703175215/http://ibyen.dk/fokus/roskildefestival/article745247.ece |archive-date=3 July 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Nine Inch Nails]] played at Orange Stage Friday night at 01.00am – 03.00am and gave what several Danish newspapers called "the best concert of Roskilde '09". [[Nine Inch Nails]] were on "Wave Goodbye"-tour and will most likely never visit Denmark again.
Roskilde '09 also meant the anticipated return of the Danish hip-hop group [[Malk de Koijn]], who played a 2-hour concert the night between Saturday and Sunday at Arena, and a big party-atmosphere at Orange Stage Thursday night, when [[Trentemøller]] and prominent guests made all of the crowd dance as if they were clubbing.
Danish rapper [[Jooks]] played as an up-and-coming act at Pavilion Junior Wednesday in the warm up days, and due to him having a major hit after he was booked (Hun vil ha' en rapper), the tent was packed to the limit in a concert, who could easily have filled one of the bigger stages.

Other big names were: [[Kanye West]], [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Coldplay]], [[Faith No More]], [[The Mars Volta]], [[Volbeat]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Lily Allen]] and [[Pet Shop Boys]].

===2010===

The weather at 2010 festival was sunny all days of the event.

===2011===
{{main|Roskilde Festival 2011}}
The 2011 had nice weather the first few days, but on Thursday-Friday there was massive rain.&lt;ref name="drd"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Vejret/2011/07/03/164609.htm|title=Skybrud i København|publisher=dr.dk|date=|accessdate=2011-07-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707081515/http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Vejret/2011/07/03/164609.htm|archive-date=7 July 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Roskilde Festival faced a sad incident when a young woman fell from the [[Tuborg]] tower to her death.&lt;ref name="drdk"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Kultur/2011/07/03/145244.htm|title=Ung kvinde død på Roskilde Festival|publisher=dr.dk|date=|accessdate=2011-07-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706232716/http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Kultur/2011/07/03/145244.htm|archive-date=6 July 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shigmo''' ({{lang-kok|शिगमो}} {{IAST|Śigmō}}) or '''Shishirotsava'''&lt;ref name="gsg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Guṅe|first=Viṭhṭhala Triṃbaka|title=Gazetteer of the Union Territory Goa, Daman and Diu: district|publisher=Goa, Daman and Diu (India). Gazetteer Dept|year=1979|volume=1|pages=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a spring festival celebrated in the Indian state of [[Goa]], where it is one of the major festivals of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] community. It is also celebrated by [[Konkani people|Konkani diaspora]] and Indian festival of [[Holi]] is part of it.
{{Anchor|Etymology of the Word}}

==Etymology==
The Konkani word ''Śigmō'' comes from the [[Prakrit]] word ''Suggimaho'' and the [[Sanskrit]] ''Sugrishmaka''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Koṅkaṇī Śabdasāgara|volume=1|pages=126|chapter=Apabhraṃśa|language=Konkani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shigmo now==
In recent years the state government has supported public Shigmo parades consisting of traditional folk and street dancers and elaborately built floats depicting scenes from regional mythology and religious scenes. Meanwhile, Shigmo festivals also continue in various rural parts of Goa, spanning over a fortnight, with different days earmarked for celebrations in different areas. This festival is celebrated around March each year. It is linked to the Hindu lunar calendar, hence its date according to the Gregorian calendar varies.

==Variations==
There are two variants of Shigmo festival: ''Dhakto Shigmo'' ("small Shigmo") and ''Vhadlo Shigmo'' ("big Shigmo").&lt;ref name="gsg"/&gt; ''Dhakto Shigmo'' is generally celebrated by farmers, the labour class and the rural population, while ''Vhadlo Shigmo'' is of greater consequence and is celebrated by everyone together.&lt;ref name="gsg" /&gt;
{{Anchor|Timing of the festival}}

==Timing==
''Dhakto Shigmo'' begins some five days before the full-moon day of the Indian lunar month of [[Phalguna]] and ends on the full-moon day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gajrani|first=S|title=History, Religion and Culture of India. |pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''Old Conquests'' areas of Goa (the areas that were under Portuguese colonial rule for a longer period of time, starting from the sixteenth century). On the other hand, ''Vhadlo Shigmo'' is mostly celebrated in the ''New Conquests'' areas, beginning on the full-moon day of Phalguna and continuing for five days.
{{Anchor|Some terms}}

==Terminology==
''Naman'' are songs sung in chorus during the festival, when villagers assemble at a fixed place. ''Jot'' is another kind of song. Dances include ''Talgadi'', ''Hanpet'', Lamp Dance and ''Gopha''.&lt;ref name="bar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhaṭṭa|first=S.C|author2=Gopāla K. Bhārgava |title=Land and people of Indian states and union territories in 36 volumes |volume=7|pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dhol'' and ''Taso'' are drums, some of which can be huge, which people carry from door to door, dancing to their sound. Money is placed in a plate carried by the performers, in response to which they sing a song called the ''Tali'', wishing the donor well. On the last day of the festival, it is believed that a spirit known as the ''Gade padap'' enters the dancers. ''Mand davarap'' refers to a collective bath taken after the festival comes to an end.

==Folk songs and dances, temple festival==
''Dhakto Shigmo'' can be considered mainly as a festival of folk songs and folk dances,&lt;ref name="gsg"/&gt; while ''Vhadlo Shigmo'' is considered a festival performed in the village temple.&lt;ref name="gsg"/&gt; It is celebrated in different temples on different dates around the same period. On the first day, the village deity is bathed and dressed in saffron robes.&lt;ref name="shig"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maḍkaikāra|first=Śrīpādrāva|title=Śrī devī Kālikā|publisher=Gomantaka Daivajña Brāhmaṇa Samājotkarṣa Sansthā|date=April 1984|pages=5–78|language=Marathi}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the offering of food, a feast is held.&lt;ref name="shig" /&gt; Shigmo celebrated in the temples of Jambavali,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bravo da Costa Rodrigues|first=Maria de Lourdes|title=Feasts, festivals, and observances of Goa |pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phatarpya,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bravo da Costa Rodrigues|first=Maria de Lourdes|title=Feasts, festivals, and observances of Goa |pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kansarpal]]&lt;ref name="shig" /&gt; and Dhargale&lt;ref name="barr"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhaṭṭa|first=S.C|author2=Gopāla K.

'''Smart Lander for Investigating Moon''' ('''SLIM''') is a [[Moon landing|lunar lander]] being developed by the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA). The lander will demonstrate precision landing technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/home/slim/SLIM/about.html |title=SLIMについて |website=SLIM homepage |accessdate=2016-06-23 |language=Japanese |quote=...&amp;nbsp;従来の「降りやすいところに降りる」着陸ではなく、「降りたいところに降りる」着陸へ&amp;nbsp;...'}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the lander is planned to be launched in 2021.&lt;ref name="jaxa63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="japanrealtime"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hongo |first=Jun|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2015/11/12/japan-plans-unmanned-moon-landing-in-2019/|title=Japan Plans Unmanned Moon Landing|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=November 12, 2015|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
SLIM is Japan's first major lunar surface mission, and will demonstrate precise, pinpoint lunar landing. During its descent to the Moon, the lander will recognize [[lunar craters]] by applying technology from [[facial recognition systems]], and determine its current location from utilizing observation data collected by the  [[SELENE]] (Kaguya) lunar orbiter mission.

===Potential rover===

The SLIM team assessed in the past the inclusion of a small rover in this mission. A preliminary concept considered a rover with two inflatable wheels that would enter —or drop into— the lava tube while deploying miniature communication relay devices along the traverse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/bitstream/a-is/548711/1/SA6000034175.pdf The Tiny Rover Payload of the SLIM Mission].

==History==
The proposal which later came to be known as SLIM existed as early as back in 2005, as the {{nihongo|''Small Lunar Landing Experiment Satellite''|小型月着陸実験衛星}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index.isas.ac.jp/News/img/20051130/ba.pdf|title=小型月着陸実験衛星|last1=Hashimoto|first1=Tatsuaki|last2=et|first2=al.|format=PDF|language=Japanese|date=30 November 2005|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 December 2013, ISAS called for proposals for its next "Competitively-Chosen Medium-Sized Focused Mission", and SLIM was among the seven proposals submitted.&lt;ref name="jaxa63"/&gt; In June 2014, SLIM passed the semi-final selection along with the [[Demonstration and Experiment of Space Technology for INterplanetary voYage|DESTINY]] technology demonstration mission, and in February 2015 SLIM was ultimately selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/bitstream/a-is/560423/1/SA6000046253.pdf|title=深宇宙探査技術実証機 DESTINY+|format=PDF|date=January 7, 2016|accessdate=2016-06-23|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; From April 2016, SLIM gained project status within JAXA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/j/isasnews/backnumber/2016/ISASnews422.pdf#page=5 |title=ISASニュース 2016.5 No.422 |publisher=[[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science]] |format=PDF |date=27 May 2016 |access-date=2016-06-23 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, [[Mitsubishi Electric]] (MELCO) was reportedly awarded the contract for building the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=May 18, 2016 |title=Japanese lunar lander to be built by Mitsubishi Electric |url =http://asia.nikkei.com/Tech-Science/Tech/Japanese-lunar-lander-to-be-built-by-Mitsubishi-Electric |newspaper=Nikkei Asian Review |accessdate=2016-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SLIM is scheduled to be the second Japanese lunar lander to operate from the Moon's surface; on 27 May 2016 [[NASA]] announced that the [[OMOTENASHI]] (Outstanding MOon exploration TEchnologies demonstrated by NAno Semi-Hard Impactor) [[CubeSat]] lander jointly developed by JAXA and the [[University of Tokyo]] will be launched as a secondary payload on [[Space Launch System]] [[Exploration Mission 1]]. OMOTENASHI will deploy a mini lunar lander weighing 1 kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=May 28, 2016 |title=小型衛星を月へ打ち上げ　ＪＡＸＡ・東大、着陸にも挑戦 18年に２基 |url =http://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXLASDG28H1Y_Y6A520C1CR0000/ |language=Japanese |newspaper=[[The Nikkei|Nikkei]] |accessdate=2016-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, because of funding difficulties arising from XARM(XRISM)'s development cost, SLIM's launch was switched from a dedicated [[Epsilon (rocket)|Epsilon]] flight to a rideshare [[H-IIA]] flight.&lt;ref name="nikkeiepsilon"&gt;{{cite news |date=August 27, 2017 |title=小型ロケット「イプシロン」、政府が19年度の打ち上げ１機中止 |url=https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXLZO20437460X20C17A8TJM000/ |language=Japanese |newspaper=[[The Nikkei|Nikkei]] |accessdate=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting cost savings will be transferred to develop other satellites that are behind schedule due to XARM.&lt;ref name="nikkeiepsilon" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3503">'''Depth ratings''' are primary design parameters and measures of a [[submarine]]'s ability to operate underwater. The depths to which submarines can dive are limited by the strengths of their hulls.

== Ratings ==
Human occupants of a submarine would suffer physiological problems if the air pressure inside were simply allowed to be equal to the water pressure outside the hull (for example, oxygen becomes toxic at high pressures).  So, when the inside air is kept at normal atmospheric pressure, the hull must be able to withstand the forces created by the outside water pressure being greater than the inside air pressure.  The outside water pressure increases with depth and so the stresses on the hull also increase with depth.  Each 10 metres (33 feet) of depth puts another atmosphere (1 bar, 14.7 psi, 101 kPa) of pressure on the hull, so at 300 
metres (1,000 feet), the hull is withstanding thirty atmospheres (30 bar, 441 psi, 3,000 kPa) of water pressure.

===Design depth===
'''Design depth''' is the nominal depth listed in the submarine's specifications. From it the designers calculate the thickness of the hull metal, the [[ship displacement|boat's displacement]], and many other related factors. Since the designers incorporate [[margin of error|margins of error]] in their calculations, crush depth of an actual vessel should be slightly deeper than its design depth.

===Test depth===
'''Test depth''' is the maximum depth at which a submarine is permitted to operate under normal peacetime circumstances, and is tested during [[sea trial]]s. The test depth is set at two-thirds of the design depth for [[United States Navy]] submarines, while the [[Royal Navy]] sets test depth at 4/7 the design depth, and the [[German Navy]] sets it at exactly one-half of design depth.&lt;ref name="fasman-rsrd"&gt;{{cite web |author=Federation of American Scientists |date=8 December 1998 |title=Run Silent, Run Deep |work=Military Analysis Network |url=http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/deep.htm |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operating depth===
The '''maximum operating depth'''&lt;ref name="jp1-02"&gt;{{cite paper |author=Department of Defense |title=Joint Publication 1-02: Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms |origyear=Superseded JP 1-02, 12 April 2001 |date=19 August 2009 |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp1_02.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (popularly called the '''never-exceed depth''') is the maximum depth at which a submarine is allowed to operate under ''any'' (''e.g.'' battle) conditions.

===Crush depth===
'''Crush depth''', officially called '''collapse depth''',&lt;ref name="jp1-02"/&gt; is the submerged depth at which a submarine's hull is expected to collapse due to pressure. This is normally calculated. However, it is not always accurate. Submarines from many nations in [[World War II]] reported being forced through crush depth, due to flooding or mechanical failure, only to have the water pumped out, or the failure repaired, and succeed in surfacing again. These reports are not necessarily verifiable, and popular misunderstanding of the difference between test depth and collapse depth can confuse the discussion.  World War II German [[U-boat]]s generally had collapse depths in the range of 200 to 280 metres (660 to 920 feet).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

''' ''The Burning Season'' ''' is a 1994 television movie directed by [[John Frankenheimer]]. The film chronicles [[Chico Mendes]]' fight to protect the rainforest.  This was [[Raúl Juliá]]'s last film released during his lifetime. The movie was based in part on the 1990 book of the same name by journalist [[Andrew Revkin]].

==Plot==
Chico Mendes was a Brazilian [[rubber tapper]], [[Trade union|unionist]] and [[environmental activist]] who was murdered in 1988 by ranchers opposed to his activism. The movie opens in 1951 with a young Chico Mendes witnessing his father's interaction with corrupt ranchers who are exploiting peasants for their work. The bulk of the film then takes place between 1983 and 1988, showing Mendes' activism to preserve the [[Amazon rainforest]], to his murder in a drive-by shooting by a disgruntled rancher.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The '''Tor Carding Forum''' (TCF) was a [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]-based [[Internet forum|forum]] specializing in the trade of [[Carding (fraud)|stolen credit card]] details, [[identity theft]] and [[Counterfeit money|currency counterfeiting]]. The site was founded by an individual known as 'Verto' who also founded the now defunct [[Evolution (marketplace)|Evolution]] [[darknet market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wired Staff|title=The Most Dangerous People on the Internet Right Now|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/dangerous-people-internet-right-now/|accessdate=1 August 2015|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site required $50 for registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kiell|title=A Carder’s First Experience|url=https://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/12/11/a-carders-first-experience/|accessdate=31 July 2015|date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenberg|first1=Andy|title=The Dark Web Gets Darker With Rise of the ‘Evolution’ Drug Market|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/09/dark-web-evolution/|accessdate=31 July 2015|date=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 investigation into counterfeit banknotes in [[Pittsburgh]] led to a source of [[Uganda]]n fakes being identified as having been purchased via the Tor Carding Forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rohrlich|first1=Justin|title=The Counterfeiting Missionary and the Fake Pittsburgh Playboy|url=https://news.vice.com/article/the-counterfeiting-missionary-and-the-fake-pittsburgh-playboy|accessdate=31 July 2015|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2014 Ryan Andrew Gustafson a.k.a. "Jack Farrel" and "Willy Clock", a US citizen living in Uganda was arrested for large scale sale of counterfeit [[Counterfeit United States currency|United States currency]] by the [[U.S. Secret Service]] which was being sold through the Tor Carding Forums as well as other [[crime forum]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krebs|first1=Brian|title=Alleged Counterfeiter "Willy Clock" Arrested|url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/12/alleged-counterfeiter-willy-clock-arrested/|accessdate=31 July 2015|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 the site closed following a hack, directing users to Evolution's forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farivar|first1=Cyrus|title=After Silk Road takedowns, Dark Web drug sites still thriving|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2014/12/after-two-silk-road-takedowns-dark-web-drug-sites-still-thriving/|accessdate=1 August 2015|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeepDotWeb|title=Evolution Marketplace Staff Speak: We are growing fast!|url=https://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/05/10/evolution-marketplace-staff-speak-we-are-growing-fast/|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Growing up in the late 16th century [[Sengoku]] era Japan, Shinmen Takezō is shunned by the local villagers as a devil child due to his wild and violent nature. Running away from home with a fellow boy at age 17, Takezo joins the Toyotomi army to fight the Tokugawa clan at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]]. However, the Tokugawa win a crushing victory, leading to nearly three hundred years of Shogunate rule. Takezo and his friend manage to survive the battle and afterwards swear to do great things with their lives. However, after their paths separate, Takezo becomes a wanted criminal and must change his name and his nature in order to escape an ignoble death.

==Synopsis==
{{Plot|date=January 2014}}
{{main|List of Vagabond chapters}}
;Miyamoto arc – ''chapters 1–21 (volumes 1–2)''

Before Takezo becomes Miyamoto, we see him as a boy from Miyamoto village, [[Sakushu|Mimasaka Province]], who can draw the fear out of anybody and lives on his wits, thus, he has to live in the mountains cut off from all. At the age of 17, he and Matahachi leave for war but Takezo gets a reputation as someone who will quickly kill anyone who crosses him. This gets Takezo into big trouble, as hunters, even from his village, come to try and kill him. Eventually, the monk Takuan and Miyamoto's childhood friend Otsu help to capture Takezo, who is subsequently hung from a tree for several days without food or water. During this time, Tsujikaze Kohei, the younger brother of a bandit that Takezo killed, comes to claim his revenge on Takezo (but only because Kohei wanted to kill his brother first). Takuan scares him away.

At the end of the arc, Takuan takes Takezo out to a remote area surrounding the village and talks to him. At the end of the fifth volume, we learn that Takezo has for the moment shed his rage and become a more graceful person - Miyamoto Musashi.

;Kyōto arc – ''chapters 22–32 (volumes 3–4)''

Miyamoto Musashi (now 21-year-old) travels to Kyōto to look for strong fighters to challenge. He immediately heads to the Yoshioka school of sword fighting, where his father's name was well known. Before he gets there, he unknowingly encounters the current leader of the school, Yoshioka Seijurō, cavorting with the many geisha in the town. After a few words, Seijurō says "You're dead," and Musashi looks down in surprise and horror to see that Seijurō's sword was at his neck.

Undaunted, he heads for the school and challenges the owner, but first he is forced to face many of those who train there, after some of the lower class members insult him. Musashi kills five members of higher rank, until finally Yoshioka Denshichirō, the more serious of the two sons of Yoshioka Kempo, decides to kill Musashi himself. In a very dramatic battle, one that Seijurō intervenes in once to give Musashi the scar on his forehead, Musashi also manages to dislocate Denshichirō's shoulder, but the fight does not end until Hon'iden Matahachi accidentally sets the school building on fire, after drinking much of the [[sake]] stored in the basement, bemoaning the "inevitable" death of his newfound hero who stood up to the Yoshioka. Denshichirō then tells Musashi to come back stronger within a year for a rematch.

Musashi escapes with his life and, once Matahachi realizes that Takezo/Musashi was the one who challenged the school, Matahachi decides to put his life back together. This became the beginning of an inferiority complex and would-be rivalry that would influence his life.

;Hōzōin arc – ''chapters 33–76 (volumes 4–8)''

Takuan encourages Musashi to be more serious about training and not throw away his life so easily, but Musashi still has a lot to learn. He splits up with Takuan and goes to visit the Hōzōin temple for its famous spear technique. Gion Toji, the Yoshioka school's assassin who seeks to kill Musashi, arrives at the temple first. He cuts both hands off a monk who challenges him and proclaims that he will come back everyday and do the same to others until he finds Musashi, throwing the temple into turmoil and unease.

Musashi appears at the temple the next day and picks a fight with Agon, one of the higher-level monks. Musashi seeks In'ei, the old and legendary master of the school, whom he does not know has retired. Agon recognizes that this must be Musashi and, seeking both to end the turmoil that Toji has caused and defend Hōzōin's name, he fights Musashi. At one point, Musashi finds himself without a sword but he manages to end the fight by breaking Agon's nose.

Gion Toji then challenges Musashi, but before they can begin, Inshun, the new master of the school and a child prodigy at the spear, breaks up the fight, wanting to battle Musashi himself. Toji backs off and Musashi has an all-out battle with Inshun. Musashi becomes tired and distraught and flees from Inshun badly beaten. He winds up later in the care of In'ei, the same monk and spearmaster he had journeyed to Hōzōin to fight. The elderly In'ei feels that while Inshun, his greatest student, has brilliantly mastered the physical art of spear fighting, he has not mastered himself and his soul. He believes Inshun needs a powerful rival to do this and trains Musashi so that he can be that rival.

In the end, Musashi gets a second battle with Inshun, with only In'ei and Agon as witnesses. Having learned a lot from his training about himself and his demons, Musashi overpowers Inshun's spirit. He manages to dodge Inshun's attack and knocks him down with a strike to the head from his own self-carved sword; after this, he reverts to his savage self and starts beating the ground and the fallen Inshun with his sword repeatedly. Both Musashi and Inshun are treated for any injuries at the Hōzōin Temple, after which Musashi was issued finer robes and a pair of swords. They leave with the vow of trying not to kill each other the next time they meet.

;Yagyū arc – ''chapters 77–104 (volumes 8–11)''

Matahachi is making a living by posing as Sasaki Kojirō, whose certification in ''Chujō-ryu'' swordsmanship he took from the mortally wounded Kusanagi Tenki. Matahachi is asked for a match by Kai Shojiro, a wandering swordsman with thirty-five years of experience. Matahachi grants Shojiro this request, but upon deciding Shojiro is a swordsman capable of killing him in combat, distracts him and flees. Matahachi runs into his mother and uncle Gon at a marketplace and states that Sasaki Kojirō is a pseudonym he uses instead of his actual name, as he feels he has shamed his family by living with a prostitute and inadvertently setting the Yoshioka temple on fire. Granny Hon'iden states that they are to look for Musashi and Otsu, whom she states "ran off together", though she is completely unaware that the two have not been with each other since they ran away from the village. This would further fuel Matahachi's inferiority complex, since he was coerced by Okō into writing a letter of renouncement to Otsu.

Meanwhile, Musashi, with Jotarō in tow, proceeds to travel to the residence of Yagyū Sekishūsai, a swordsman of great renown. Yagyū Sekishūsai is delighted to receive news that his grandson, Hyogonosuke, is returning to his temple. Yoshioka Denshichirō is constantly requesting a duel with Sekishūsai, but is refused an audience each time. By chance meeting, Musashi meets Hyogonosuke and Jotarō meets Otsu. Musashi happens upon a peony cut by Sekishūsai and requests an audience with the person who cut the peony. At the hall of the Yagyū, Musashi attempts to antagonize the members into fighting him, hoping that by besting them he will be granted audience to Sekishūsai, however his efforts prove fruitless, as the disciples are used to such methods. Jotarō, however, kills the Yagyū pet dog, after it attacks him. The group attempts to physically punish Jotarō, but Musashi claims that he must take the punishment for his disciple and uses this as an excuse to engage in battle with the Yagyū senior disciples. Jotarō runs to find Otsu, but falls into a pit. After a long and exhaustive bout with the senior disciples, Musashi eventually loses them in a bamboo forest and sneaks into Sekishūsai's cottage after a brief, but emotional reunion with Otsu. Musashi is shocked to discover that Sekishūsai is now an old, bedridden man, but nonetheless has an impacting discussion over the nature of being the greatest swordsman and learns one of his most valuable lessons: "invincible is just a word." Musashi leaves Jotarō in the care of the Yagyū and leaves alone.

;Tsujikaze Kōhei/Shishido Baiken arc – ''chapters 105–127 (volumes 11–13)''

The arc begins with Matahachi fleeing from his uncle Gon and mother, after the former questions the legitimacy of his claim to be Sasaki Kojirō. Matahachi runs into the ronin Kai Shojiro, who has since realized Matahachi an imposter and thus harbors murderous intent. While fleeing, Matahachi finds himself on the mountain trail leading to Shishido Baiken, a figure renowned for his chain and sickle technique, and encounters a mysterious young girl armed with a chain and sickle. The ronin and his companion eventually catch up to the fleeing Matahachi, but Gon arrives in time to protect him. Gon is killed in the ensuing struggle, while Matahachi continues to flee. The ronin eventually sees the mysterious girl and mentions she has a weapon similar to Shishido Baiken, which causes him to drop his pursuit of Matahachi and instead follow her. Shishido Baiken, however, is revealed to be none other than Tsujikaze Kōhei. Matahachi stumbles upon his house to see him smashing Shojiro's skull open. As he is discovered hiding, Baiken makes him bury the ronin and the bodies of two others, including his uncle Gon. As he painfully reminisces about his uncle, Matahachi spies Musashi arriving from afar and quickly runs away, praising Musashi for how strong he appears to have become.

Musashi, starving, happens upon a kindly hermit's hut, where he is fed and informed that Shishido Baiken is dead. The hermit recants that Baiken was nothing more than a despicable bandit leader who often gave her trouble and that respectable swordsmen only began seeking him after his death. Baiken and the girl spar with their chains and sickles, after which, as Baiken sleeps, the girl playfully examines Baiken's face to reveal to the reader a massive facial scar that had previously been obscured by Baiken's hair. Musashi eventually enters Baiken's hut, leading to shocked reactions from both Musashi and Tsujikaze. The girl, now identified as Rindo, attacks Musashi, but Baiken tells her that she should not meddle in their affairs. Rindo, nonplussed, climbs a tree to observe the combat, commenting that Musashi is different from the other swordsmen that have appeared in the past.

At the start of the match, Baiken states that while he does not wish to kill Musashi, he can only use his chain and sickle with the intent to kill. Musashi is initially intimidated by Baiken's technique and asks about his master. Baiken responds that Rindo is his master. The origin of the current incarnation of Baiken is then shown. After his spat with Musashi four years ago, Tsujikaze fell into a deep depression and began "looking for a place to die". During that time, he encountered and slew Baiken and his gang. Rindo initially attacked Tsujikaze, however she relented and passed out after seeing his grisly scar, after which they became fast friends. Back in the current battle between "Baiken" and Musashi, Baiken manages to wrap his chain around Musashi's neck. He states that Musashi's life is ultimately meaningless in the grand scheme of things. After Musashi frees himself, Baiken attempts an under-handed tactic to attack a distracted Musashi.

"Baiken" then begins to display a twisted grin, displaying that he has reverted to his former, blood-thirsty "Tsujikaze" persona, which saddens Rindo. Musashi dispatches him, severing all of Tsujikaze's fingers on his left hand save his thumb and leaving a deep wound through his shoulder. Tsujikaze pleads Musashi to help treat his wound, saying he wishes to escape the "cycle of death". Musashi seems reluctant at first, but eventually relents and aides him. While recuperating, Tsujikaze remarks that his pride was destroyed by someone who was "further along the path of death" than he, a man called Sasaki Kojirō. It is implied Kojirō is the one who gave Tsujikaze his scar.

During the epilogue, Tsujikaze's past is further delved into, revealing how he came to adopt his macabre outlook on life and the events leading up to his encounter with Musashi in the first arc.

;Sasaki Kojirō arc – ''chapters 128–179 (volumes 14–20)''

This arc follows the upbringing of his arch-rival, Sasaki Kojirō. It begins in the year 1583 CE, with a letter from Sasaki Sukeyasu to his former teacher, Kanemaki Jisai, who has retired and is living as a hermit in a small coastal village, to please take care of his only son Sasaki Kojirō. Soon afterwards, Jisai spots the baby on a boat in the middle of a storm offshore. He rescues Kojirō and raises him, not knowing that his adoptive son is in fact, deaf.

Kojirō grows into a healthy young boy, but is distanced from the villagers because of his deafness and his association with Jisai, who is seen as a crazy old man and fraud, since he advertised himself as a teacher of ''Chujō-ryu'' swordsmanship. This changes when Kojirō befriends Kusanagi Tenki, the local bully who longs to be a great swordsman and achieve the title of "Invincible Under the Sun". Together they plot to take down Fudo, a powerful swordsman who terrorizes the village by abducting girls just as they hit puberty. The assault does not go well, Tenki being scarred for life and Kojirō realizing his bloodlust in battle. He cut off Fudo's right hand but it was Jisai who saves the village and the boys' lives when he takes Fudo down with one stroke.

Time passes and Kojirō becomes a powerful teenager longing to be taught by Jisai, who refuses, haunted by how Kojirō whimsically massacred Fudo's body after he was already dead. When Itō Ittōsai, an old pupil of Jisai and a renowned swordsman, strolls into town, he disrupts the balance between Jisai and Kojirō. Itō sees that Kojirō is a powerful swordsman, a "real tiger", like Itō and Jisai. He instigates a duel between wandering swordsmen including Ueda Ryōhei and Denshichirō of the Yoshioka. Kojirō discovers them, and he and Denshichirō duel. Denshichirō discovers that though Kojirō is deaf, he speaks volumes through battle. The duel ends with both suffering serious injuries, and Denshichirō longing to meet Kojirō again.

Soon afterwards, Kojirō leaves the village and travels with Ittōsai, Jisai having finally accepted his adoptive son's future as a swordsman and entrusting Kojirō to Ittosai's care. Jisai sends Tenki after Kojirō along with money and a certificate of swordsmanship, which Matahachi would ultimately acquire. Kojirō and Ittōsai stumble upon Muso Gonnosuke, but Gonnosuke is not prepared for "the stage", as Ittōsai calls it, and Kojirō quickly defeats him. He takes his defeat in stride and travels with them as they discover the battlefield of Sekigahara, which has just ended. Ittōsai challenges the remaining Tokugawa soldiers and a young Takezo also enters the fray, hoping to kill a general. This is the in-universe chronological first encounter between Kojirō and the future Musashi. When the battle is over, Ittōsai and Gonnosuke are separated from Kojirō. Ittōsai states that once Kojirō has killed about one hundred men he will have acquired his survival instinct. If Kojirō can survive this, Ittōsai says, then the next time they meet will be as opponents.

;Yoshioka arc – ''chapters 180–242 (volumes 21–27)''

The story focuses on Miyamoto Musashi as he returns to Kyōto in 1604 (the 9th year of the [[Keichō]] era) to fulfill his promise for a rematch with the Yoshioka brothers.

Musashi is unexpectedly met with a public bulletin of a challenge from Yoshioka Denshichirō, which he accepts. As Musashi practices and is about to rest in Rendaiji Field, Yoshioka Seijurō attempts to kill him. Musashi cuts him down, but the Yoshioka clan is devastated by this. Seijurō attacked Musashi in secret without informing anyone else and so the clan sees the killing of Seijurō as unforgivable. Musashi encounters Hon'ami Koetsu, a renowned sword sharpener, who offers Musashi a room to stay in while the Kempo clan seek him out. While travelling, Musashi has a tense encounter with the heads of the Kempo, but Denshichirō adamantly forbids any foul-play against Musashi. Gion Toji reappears, looking noticeably worse for wear (he seems to symbolize Musashi had he remained so angry). Toji has been away from the Yoshioka dojo during his search for Musashi and, in outrage at Denshichirō's orders, attacks Musashi blindly only to be cut down with a single slash to the neck.

Ueda, seriously worried over the possibility of his master's death, hatches a scheme to solicit Sasaki Kojirō to fight Denshichirō's battle instead. Matahachi encounters the real Sasaki Kojirō as he travels through a field. The Kempo swordsmen invite Kojirō back to their dojo, but the encounter turns bloody after one member attacks him. Matahachi then takes Kojirō to the Yoshioka dojo, posing as his interpreter. The men are outraged that someone who has killed one of their own is invited as an honored guest, but Ueda stifles the furor. Matahachi flees after he discovers the plot to have Kojirō fight Musashi. When Ueda pleads to Denshichirō to give his consent to the plan, Denshichirō excommunicates Ueda.

Kojirō wanders away from the Yoshioka dojo out of boredom and returns to the place he was staying, which is the same place Musashi is staying at. Musashi spies Kojirō attempting to cut through Musashi's snowman's head with a stick, but is frustrated that he cannot. The two engage in a playful stick fight with thin tree branches in which Musashi "wins", however, the fight takes a serious tone when Kojirō then eagerly draws his sword in the hopes of a real fight. They are cut short by Hon'ami's mother, who calls the two men in for dinner. Musashi and Kojirō develop a bizarre camaraderie, in which Musashi seems to revere Kojirō more than any other swordsman he has met to date. Musashi leaves the next day to duel with Denshichirō and sees that Kojirō is now able to completely cut through his snowman's head.

Before the duel with Denshichirō begins, Ueda draws a matchlock pistol on Musashi, who dispatches his weapon. Ueda states that if Musashi kills Denshichirō then the Yoshioka clan will become solely fixated on killing him. Musashi battles Denshichirō regardless. The duel seems one-sided, as Musashi sees no need to draw his blade for the majority of the fight. Musashi eventually does draw his blade and cleaves through Denshichirō's arm with one stroke. Denshichirō, now solely intent on killing Musashi with no regard for his own safety, grasps Musashi, who unceremoniously guts him with a swift stroke of Denshichirō's wakizashi. Denshichirō solemnly states that he is glad to have had Musashi as his final opponent and perishes. Ueda Ryōhei, now head of the Yoshioka clan and hell-bent on vengeance, plans to ambush Musashi with all seventy Yoshioka members when Musashi attempts to leave Kyoto.

Musashi and Matahachi run into each other and have a tearful reunion. The meeting turns ugly when Matahachi's jealousy of Musashi's skill crops up, causing a drunken Matahachi to accuse Musashi of running off with Otsu. Musashi, appalled at the notion, punches Matahachi in the face and renounces his friendship. Musashi begins to meditate within a massive pine tree at Ichijōji. As he reflects on his isolation from the world, he overhears Ueda and the rest of the heads of the Yoshioka plot to ambush him. Musashi deduces that he will certainly die from such an attack and opts to strike the small number of the heads of the Yoshioka beneath the tree. Losing his composure, Musashi antagonizes Ueda, who then makes light of the fact that Musashi would become so angry at his own imminent death but feel nothing for killing Denshichirō and his brother. Ueda takes advantage of this emotional distraction to successfully cut Musashi, but the battle is cut short by Takuan, who houses Musashi for the night. During his stay, Musashi states he will flee before the fight the next day and that he is unaffected by the reaction a "cowardly" retreat would have with other people.

Mid-flight, however, Musashi begins to have second thoughts and returns for reasons unknown even to him. He spies the Yoshioka amassing under the same great pine as where Musashi had his confrontation with Ueda Ryōhei. Musashi takes his early arrival to his advantage and descends upon the Yoshioka swiftly and silently, successfully carving a swath through their ranks to Ueda. Musashi, critically wounded and exhausted, lurches his way out of Kyōto and runs into Akemi, the girl with whom he lived briefly. Akemi states that Musashi was foolish for abandoning his life with her, attempts to stab him, says she is Seijurō's woman, then proceeds to leap into a nearby river before a stunned Musashi.

;After the Yoshioka War/Kojirō revisited – ''chapters 243–present [327] (volumes 28–present)''

The arc begins an unspecified time after the first Kojirō arc, with Kojirō in the den of a kindly prostitute and her pet frog; Gonnosuke and Ittosai are noticeably absent. The prostitute is unusually philanthropic; she refuses money if her clientele are nice to her. The prostitute goes outside after making love to Kojirō to see Tsujikaze Kōhei (scar absent). Tsujikaze and the prostitute had previously been together and he is returning after his imprisonment, downward spiral into severe depression and subsequent release. He pierces her right eye with his sword and stomps on her pet frog, killing it. Kojirō, upon seeing this, retrieves his sword and confronts Tsujikaze. Tsujikaze, not taking Kojirō seriously, states that Kojirō is merely wasting time until his death. Tsujikaze attempts to attack him, but Kojirō dodges, shoves Kōhei back then slices his face, delivering the scar seen in the Baiken arc.

After Musashi's great fight, he is taken care of by Takuan and finally encounters Jotarō, Matahachi (who has renounced his past resentment) and Otsu. While he is recovering from his injuries, Matahachi resigns himself to Otsu loving Musashi over himself, and separately tells both of them to have a relationship. When he awakens, it is revealed that Musashi cannot walk because of the severe wound in his right calf (caused by Ueda Ryōhei's final slash) and, according to "one of the two best physicians in Kyōto", his fighting days are over. Soldiers then come to arrest Musashi for killing the seventy warriors of the Yoshioka.

When next seen, he is imprisoned at Nijō Castle, although, according to the ''shoshidai'' of Kyōto in a conversation with Koetsu, it is more of a protective custody, since his nationwide fame from defeating the Yoshioka now makes him the target of possible revenge, challenges from fighters seeking fame and invitations to serve as a samurai. As such, Musashi will not face beheading or [[seppuku]]. However, the possible end of his fighting career causes distress for him, Jotarō and Otsu. Musashi takes up a journey to visit a cave back in his hometown where he had promised a skeleton that he would return if he was stronger. Just as he reached it, Itō Ittōsai challenges him to a duel. Ittōsai remembers Musashi from fighting alongside him for a brief moment with Kojirō and Gonnosuke but Musashi does not recall anything, only that Ittōsai is famous for his fighting style. When the fight seemed over, Ittōsai revealed his right hand with only his pinky and ring finger still on his hand, he claims that Kojirō is stronger and recalls the time when he had left Kojirō for dead with vengeful peasants.

In the meantime, Matahachi's mother had died and the time shifts towards the future when an old Matahachi is telling a group of villagers about Musashi's, Kojirō's and his story.

==Production==
Takehiko Inoue started ''Vagabond'' having wondered what the character was like when he read ''[[Musashi (novel)|Musashi]]''. Having come off of drawing a sports manga, he wanted to create a series about more basic concepts, such as "life and death, the human condition, etc."  Rather than portray Musashi's later life in his "enlightened state", which has been written about often, the author chose to depict the lesser known "young man reaching that point of enlightenment when he comes from a place of being so like an animal." In 2009, he stated that he made his weekly deadline thanks to only having to draw the people, with his five assistants drawing the backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Deb | last=Aoki| url=http://manga.about.com/od/mangaartistswriters/a/TakehikoInoue.htm| title=Interview: Takehiko Inoue| publisher=[[About.com]] | accessdate=2015-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Vagabond'' won the Grand Prize for manga at the 2000 [[Japan Media Arts Festival]]. The following is an excerpt from the speech congratulating Takehiko Inoue: "From [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi|Toyotomi]] to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu|Tokugawa]]. Musashi Miyamoto grew up amidst the turn of two great eras. Mr. Inoue has taken the powerful Musashi who was sometimes called a 'beast' and drawn him as a vagabond. The artist brags about boldly challenging the national literary work of Eiji Yoshikawa, even so, the sense of speed that he creates is impressive. I send my applause to the artist for creating a new image of Musashi."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plaza.bunka.go.jp/english/festival/2000/manga/000360/ | author=Japan Media Arts Plaza | title=2000 Japan Media Arts Festival Manga Division Grand Prize Vagabond | accessdate=2007-08-26 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011214402/http://plaza.bunka.go.jp/english/festival/2000/manga/000360/ | archive-date=2007-10-11 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, the series won the 24th [[Kodansha Manga Award]] in the general category.&lt;ref name="KodanshaHahn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/kodansha.shtml | author=Joel Hahn | title=Kodansha Manga Awards | work=Comic Book Awards Almanac | accessdate=2007-08-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070816031310/http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/kodansha.shtml |archivedate = 2007-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vagabond'' also received the [[Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize]] in 2002, and the North American version earned Inoue a nomination for the 2003 [[Eisner Award]] in the Best Writer/Artist category.&lt;ref name="four months"/&gt; ''Vagabond'' has sold 82 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=ritsumei&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~shuku/2012/CB2012/CB20121213.pdf | script-title=ja:コンテンツビジネス概論‐12 | page=12 | publisher=[[Ritsumeikan University]] | accessdate=2013-11-29 | language=Japanese | date=2012-12-13 | title=Archived copy | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222055023/http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~shuku/2012/CB2012/CB20121213.pdf | archive-date=2014-02-22 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hatnote|This article is about the war itself. For Procopius's history of the conflict, see ''[[The Vandalic War]]''.}}
The '''Vandalic''' or '''Vandal War''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Βανδηλικὸς Πόλεμος}}, ''Vandēlikòs Pólemos'') was a conflict fought in [[North Africa]] (largely in modern [[Tunisia]]) between the forces of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] or [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandalic Kingdom of Carthage]], in 533–534. It was the first of [[Justinian I]]'s wars of reconquest of the lost [[Western Roman Empire]].

The Vandals had occupied [[Roman North Africa]] in the early 5th century, and established an independent kingdom there. Under their first king, [[Geiseric]], the formidable Vandal navy carried out pirate attacks across the Mediterranean, [[Sack of Rome (455)|sacked]] [[Rome]] and defeated a massive Roman invasion in 468. After Geiseric's death, relations with the surviving Eastern Roman Empire normalized, although tensions flared up occasionally due to the Vandals' militant adherence to [[Arianism]] and their persecution of the [[Chalcedonian]] native population. In 530, a palace coup in [[Carthage]] overthrew the pro-Roman [[Hilderic]] and replaced him with his cousin [[Gelimer]]. The Eastern Roman emperor Justinian took this as a pretext to interfere in Vandal affairs, and after he secured his eastern frontier with [[Sassanid Persia]] in 532, he began preparing an expedition under general [[Belisarius]], whose secretary [[Procopius]] wrote the main historical narrative of the war. Justinian took advantage of, or even instigated, rebellions in the remote Vandal provinces of [[Sardinia]] and [[Tripolitania]]. These not only distracted Gelimer from the Emperor's preparations, but also weakened Vandal defences through the dispatch of the bulk of the Vandal navy and a large portion of their army under Gelimer's brother [[Tzazon]] to Sardinia.

The Roman expeditionary force set sail from Constantinople in late June 533, and after a sea voyage along the coasts of Greece and southern Italy, landed on the African coast at [[Chebba|Caputvada]] in early September, to Gelimer's complete surprise. The Vandal king gathered his forces and met the Roman army at the [[Battle of Ad Decimum]], near Carthage, on 13 September. Gelimer's elaborate plan to encircle and destroy the Roman army came close to success, but Belisarius was able to drive the Vandal army to flight and occupy Carthage. Gelimer withdrew to [[Bulla Regia]], where he gathered his remaining strength, including the army of Tzazon, which returned from Sardinia. In December, Gelimer advanced towards Carthage and met the Romans at the [[Battle of Tricamarum]]. The battle resulted in a Roman victory and the death of Tzazon. Gelimer fled to a remote mountain fortress, where he was blockaded until he surrendered in the spring.

Belisarius returned to Constantinople with the Vandals' royal treasure and the captive Gelimer to enjoy a [[Roman triumph|triumph]], while Africa was formally restored to imperial rule as the [[praetorian prefecture of Africa]]. Imperial control scarcely reached beyond the old Vandal kingdom, however, and the [[Mauri people|Moorish]] tribes of the interior proved unwilling to accept imperial rule and soon rose up in rebellion. The new province was shaken by the wars with the Moors and military rebellions, and it was not until 548 that peace was restored and Roman government firmly established.

== Background ==

=== Establishment of the Vandalic Kingdom ===
In the course of the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|gradual decline and dissolution]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the early 5th century, the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe of the [[Vandals]], allied with the [[Alans]], had established themselves in the [[Iberian peninsula]]. In 429, the Roman governor of the [[Diocese of Africa]], [[Bonifacius]], who had rebelled against the West Roman emperor [[Valentinian III]] (r. 425–455) and was facing an invasion by imperial troops, called upon the Vandalic King [[Geiseric]] for aid. Thus, in May 429, Geiseric crossed the [[straits of Gibraltar]] with his entire people, reportedly 80,000 in total.&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. I, pp. 244–246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merrils &amp; Miles (2010), pp. 47–54&lt;/ref&gt; Geiseric's Vandals and Alans, however, had their own plans, and aimed to conquer the African provinces outright. Their possession of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]], [[Mauretania Sitifensis]] and most of [[Numidia]] was recognized in 435 by the Western Roman court, but this was only a temporary expedient. Warfare soon recommenced, and in October 439, the capital of Africa, [[Carthage]], [[Battle of Carthage (439)|fell]] to the Vandals. In 442, another treaty exchanged the provinces hitherto held by the Vandals with the core of the African diocese, the rich provinces of [[Zeugitana]] and [[Byzacena]], which the Vandals received no longer as ''[[foederati]]'' of the Empire, but as their own possessions. These events marked the foundation of the Vandalic Kingdom, as the Vandals made Carthage their capital and settled around it.&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. I, pp. 247–249, 254–257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merrils &amp; Miles (2010), pp. 54–55, 60–65&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Vandals now gained control of the lucrative African grain trade with Italy, they also launched raids on the coasts of the Mediterranean that ranged as far as the [[Aegean Sea]] and culminated in their [[Sack of Rome (455)|sack]] of [[Rome]] itself in 455, which allegedly lasted for two weeks. Taking advantage of the chaos that followed Valentinian's death in 455, Geiseric then regained control—albeit rather tenuous—of the Mauretanian provinces, and with his fleet took over [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]. [[Sicily]] barely escaped the same fate through the presence there of [[Ricimer]].&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. I, pp. 257–258, 325–327&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merrils &amp; Miles (2010), pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this period, the Vandals survived several Roman attempts at a counterstrike: the Eastern Roman general [[Aspar]] had led an unsuccessful expedition in 431, an expedition assembled by the Western emperor [[Majorian]] (r. 457–461) off the coast of Spain in 460 was scattered or captured by the Vandals before it could set sail, and finally, in 468, Geiseric [[Battle of Cape Bon (468)|defeated]] a huge joint expedition by both western and eastern empires under [[Basiliscus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. I, pp. 331–337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (1896), pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of this disaster, and following further Vandal raids against the shores of [[Greece]], the eastern emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] (r. 474–491) concluded a "perpetual peace" with Geiseric (474/476).&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. I, p. 390&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diehl4"&gt;Diehl (1896), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman–Vandal relations until 533===
The Vandal state was unique in many respects among the Germanic kingdoms that succeeded the Western Roman Empire: instead of respecting and continuing the established Roman socio-political order, they completely replaced it with their own. Whereas the kings of Western Europe continued to pay deference to the emperors and minted coinage with their portraits, the Vandal kings portrayed themselves as fully independent rulers. The Vandals also consciously differentiated themselves from the native Romano-African population through their continued use of their native language and peculiar dress, which served to emphasize their distinct social position as the elite of the kingdom. In addition, the Vandals—like most Germanics, adherents of [[Arianism]]—persecuted the [[Chalcedonian]] majority of the local population, especially in the reigns of [[Huneric]] (r. 477–484) and [[Gunthamund]] (r. 484–496).&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merrils &amp; Miles (2010), pp. 90–102&lt;/ref&gt; The emperors at [[Constantinople]] protested at this, but the peace held for almost sixty years, and relations were often friendly, especially between Emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] (r. 491–518) and [[Thrasamund]] (r. 496–523), who largely ceased the persecutions.&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, pp. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Germanic kingdoms 526CE.png|thumb|right|250px|Map of the East Roman Empire and the Germanic kingdoms of the western Mediterranean in 526]]
In 523, [[Hilderic]] (r. 523–530), the son of Huneric, ascended the throne at Carthage. Himself a descendant of Valentinian III, Hilderic re-aligned his kingdom and brought it closer to the Roman Empire: according to the account of [[Procopius]] (''The Vandalic War'', I.9) he was an unwarlike, amiable person, who ceased the persecution of the Chalcedonians, exchanged gifts and embassies with [[Justinian I]] (r. 527–565) even before the latter's rise to the throne, and even replaced his image in his coins with that of the emperor. Justinian evidently hoped that this rapprochement would lead to the peaceful subordination of the Vandal state to his empire.&lt;ref name="Diehl4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hilderic's pro-Roman policies, coupled with a defeat suffered against the [[Mauri people|Moors]] in Byzacena, led to opposition among the Vandal nobility, which resulted in his overthrow and imprisonment in 530 by his cousin, [[Gelimer]] (r. 530–534). Justinian seized the opportunity, demanding Hilderic's restoration, with Gelimer predictably refusing to do so. Justinian then demanded Hilderic's release to Constantinople, threatening war otherwise. Geiseric was unwilling to surrender a rival claimant to Justinian, who could use him to stir up trouble in his kingdom, and probably expected war to come either way, according to [[J.B. Bury]]. He consequently refused Justinian's demand on the grounds that this was an internal matter among the Vandals.&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, pp. 125–126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (1896), pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt;

Justinian now had his pretext, and with [[Eternal Peace (532)|peace restored]] on his eastern frontier with [[Sassanid Persia]] in 532, he started assembling an invasion force.&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; According to Procopius (''The Vandalic War'', I.10), the news of Justinian's decision to go to war with the Vandals caused great consternation among the capital's elites, in whose minds the disaster of 468 was still fresh. The financial officials resented the expenditure involved, while the military was weary from the Persian war and feared the Vandals' sea-power. The emperor's scheme received support mostly from the Church, reinforced by the arrival of victims of renewed persecutions from Africa. Only the powerful minister [[John the Cappadocian]] dared to openly voice his opposition to the expedition, however, and Justinian disregarded it and pressed on with his preparations.&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, pp. 126–127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (1896), pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diplomatic preparations and revolts in Tripolitania and Sardinia ===
Soon after his seizure of power, Gelimer's domestic position began to deteriorate, as he persecuted his political enemies among the Vandal nobility, confiscating their property and executing many of them.&lt;ref name="Hughes72"&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; These actions undermined his already doubtful legitimacy in the eyes of many, and contributed to the outbreak of two revolts in remote provinces of the Vandal kingdom: in [[Sardinia]], where the local governor, [[Godas]], declared himself an independent ruler, and shortly after in [[Tripolitania]], where the native population, led by a certain Pudentius, rebelled against Vandal rule.&lt;ref name="Hughes72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bury128"/&gt; Although Procopius' narrative makes both uprisings seem coincidental, Ian Hughes points out the fact that both rebellions broke out shortly before the commencement of the Roman expedition against the Vandals, and that both Godas and Pudentius immediately asked for assistance from Justinian, as evidence of an active diplomatic involvement by the Emperor in their preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Godas' emissaries, Justinian detailed Cyril, one of the officers of the ''foederati'', with 400 men, to accompany the invasion fleet and then sail on to Sardinia.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2009, p. 76"&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Gelimer reacted to Godas' rebellion by sending the bulk of his fleet, 120 of his best vessels, and 5,000 men under his own brother [[Tzazon]], to suppress it. The Vandal king's decision played a crucial role in the outcome of the war, for it removed from the scene the Vandal navy, the main obstacle to a Roman landing in Africa, as well as a large part of his army. Gelimer also chose to ignore the revolt in Tripolitania for the moment, as it was both a lesser threat and more remote, while his lack of manpower constrained him to await Tzazon's return from Sardinia before undertaking further campaigns.&lt;ref name="Bury128"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (1896), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes80"&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, both rulers tried to win over allies: Gelimer contacted the [[Visigoth]] king [[Theudis]] (r. 531–548) and proposed an alliance,&lt;ref name="Hughes80"/&gt; while Justinian secured the benevolent neutrality and support of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] of Italy, which had strained relations with the Vandals over the ill treatment of the Ostrogoth princess [[Amalafrida]], the wife of Thrasamund. The Ostrogoth court readily agreed to allow the Roman invasion fleet to use the harbour of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] in Sicily and establish a market for the provisioning of the Roman troops there.&lt;ref name="Bury129"&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (1896), pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposing forces ===
[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 013.jpg|thumb|A member of the retinue of Emperor [[Justinian I]] in the mosaic in the [[Basilica of San Vitale|Church of San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]], which is usually identified with Belisarius]]

Justinian selected one of his most trusted and talented generals, [[Belisarius]], who had recently distinguished himself [[Battle of Dara|against the Persians]] and in the suppression of the [[Nika riots]], to lead the expedition. As Ian Hughes points out, Belisarius was also eminently suited for this appointment for two other reasons: he was a native Latin-speaker, and was solicitous of the welfare of the local population, keeping a tight leash on his troops. Both these qualities would be crucial in winning support from the Latin-speaking African population.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; Belisarius was accompanied by his wife, [[Antonina (wife of Belisarius)|Antonina]], and by Procopius, his secretary, who wrote the history of the war.&lt;ref name="Bury129"/&gt;

According to Procopius (''The Vandalic War'', I.11), the army consisted of 10,000 infantry, partly drawn from the field army (''[[comitatenses]]'') and partly from among the ''foederati'', as well as 5,000 cavalry. There were also some 1,500–2,000 of Belisarius' own retainers (''[[bucellarii]]''), an elite corps (it is unclear if their number is included in the 5,000 cavalry mentioned as a total figure by Procopius). In addition, there were two additional bodies of allied troops, both mounted archers, 600 Huns and 400 [[Heruls]]. The army was led by an array of experienced officers, among whom the [[eunuch]] [[Solomon (Byzantine general)|Solomon]] was chosen as Belisarius' chief of staff (''[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|domesticus]]'') and the former [[praetorian prefect]] [[Archelaus (praetorian prefect)|Archelaus]] was placed in charge of the army's provisioning. The whole force was transported on 500 vessels manned by 30,000 sailors under admiral [[Calonymus of Alexandria]], guarded by ninety-two [[dromon]] warships.&lt;ref name="Bury127"&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (1896), pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional view, as expressed by J.B. Bury, is that the expeditionary force was remarkably small for the task, especially given the military reputation of the Vandals, and that perhaps it reflects the limit of the fleet's carrying capacity, or perhaps it was an intentional move to limit the impact of any defeat.&lt;ref name="Bury127"/&gt; Ian Hughes however comments that even in comparison with the armies of the early Roman Empire, Belisarius' army was a "large, well-balanced force capable of overcoming the Vandals and may have contained a higher proportion of high quality, reliable troops than the armies stationed in the east".&lt;ref name="Hughes 2009, p. 76"/&gt;

On the Vandal side, the picture is less clear. The Vandal army was not a professional and mostly volunteer force like the [[East Roman army]], but comprised every able-bodied male of the Vandal people. Hence modern estimates on the available forces vary along with estimates on the total Vandal population, from a high of between 30,000–40,000 men out of a total Vandal population of at most 200,000 people (Diehl and Bury), to as few as 25,000 men—or even 20,000, if their losses against the Moors are taken into account—for a population base of 100,000 (Hughes).&lt;ref name="Bury128"&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (1896), pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their martial reputation, the Vandals had grown less warlike over time, having come to lead a luxurious life amidst the riches of Africa. In addition, their mode of fighting was ill-suited to confronting Belisarius' veterans: the Vandal army was composed exclusively of cavalry, lightly armoured and armed only for hand-to-hand combat, to the point of neglecting entirely the use of bows or javelins, in stark contrast to Belisarius' heavily armoured [[cataphracts]] and horse archers.&lt;ref name="Bury128"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (1896), pp. 9, 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), pp. 82–84&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vandals were also weakened by the hostility of their Roman subjects, the continued existence among the Vandals of a faction loyal to Hilderic, and by the ambivalent position of the Moorish tribes, who watched the oncoming conflict from the sidelines, ready to join the victor and seize the spoils.&lt;ref name="Bury128"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (1896), pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt;

== The war ==

=== Belisarius' army sails to Africa ===
Amidst much pomp and ceremony, with Justinian and the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] in attendance, the Roman fleet set sail around 21 June 533. The initial progress was slow, as the fleet spent five days at [[Heraclea Perinthus]] waiting for horses and further four days at [[Abydos (Hellespont)|Abydus]] due to lack of wind. The fleet left the [[Dardanelles]] on 1 July, and crossed the Aegean Sea to the port of [[Methoni, Messenia|Methone]], where it was joined by the last contingents of troops. Belisarius took advantage of an enforced stay there due to a lull in the wind to train his troops and acquaint the disparate contingents with each other. It was at Methone, however, that 500 men died of [[dysentery]] caused by mouldy bread. According to Procopius, the responsibility fell on John the Cappadocian, who had cut costs by baking it only once, with the result that the bread went bad. Justinian was informed, but John does not appear to have been punished. Belisarius took steps to remedy the situation, and the army soon recovered.&lt;ref name="Bury129"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

From Methone, the fleet sailed up the [[Ionian Sea]] to [[Zacynthus]], from where they crossed over to Italy. The crossing took longer than expected due to lack of wind, and the army suffered of lack of fresh water when the supplies they had brought aboard went bad. Eventually, the fleet reached [[Catania]] in Sicily, from where Belisarius sent Procopius ahead to Syracuse to gather intelligence on the Vandals' activities. By chance, Procopius met a merchant friend of his there, whose servant had just arrived from Carthage. The latter informed Procopius that not only were the Vandals unaware of Belisarius' sailing, but that Gelimer, who had just dispatched Tzazon's expedition to Sardinia, was away from Carthage at the small inland town of Hermione. Procopius quickly informed Belisarius, who immediately ordered the army to re-embark and set sail for the African coast. After sailing by [[Malta]], they reached Cape [[Chebba|Caputvada]] on the eastern shore of modern Tunisia some 162 [[Roman mile]]s (240&amp;nbsp;km) south from Carthage.&lt;ref name="Bury130"&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (1896), pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advance on Carthage and the Battle of Ad Decimum ===
When the Roman fleet reached Africa, a council was held aboard Belisarius' flagship (''The Vandalic War'', I.15), where many of his officers advocated an immediate attack on Carthage itself, especially since it was the only fortified city in the Vandal realm, the walls of the other cities having been torn down to prevent a rebellion. Belisarius, however, mindful of the fate of the 468 expedition and wary of an encounter with the Vandal fleet, spoke against it. Thus the army disembarked and built a fortified camp to spend the night.&lt;ref name="Hughes80"&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bury130"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (1896), pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Belisarius knew that success for his expedition relied on gaining the support of the local population, which had largely retained its Roman identity and to which he presented himself as a liberator. Thus on the next day of the landing, when some of his men stole some fruit from a local orchard, he severely punished them, and assembled the army and exhorted them to maintain discipline and restraint towards the native population, lest they abandon their Roman sympathies and go over to the Vandals. Belisarius' pleas bore results, for, as Procopius reports (''The Vandalic War'', I.17), "the soldiers behaved with moderation, and they neither began any unjust brawls nor did anything out of the way, and [Belisarius], by displaying great gentleness and kindness, won the Libyans to his side so completely that thereafter he made the journey as if in his own land".&lt;ref name="Bury130-1"&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, pp. 130–131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (1896), pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes85"&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Then the Roman army began its march north, following the coastal road. 300 horse under [[John the Armenian]] were detached as an advance guard some 3 miles (4.5&amp;nbsp;km) in front of the main army, while the 600 Huns covered the army's left flank. Belisarius himself with his ''bucellarii'' led up the rear, to guard against any attack from Gelimer, who was known to be in the vicinity. The fleet followed the army, sailing along the coast.&lt;ref name="Bury130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes86"&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The first town they encountered was [[Syllectum]], which was captured by a detachment under Boriades by a ruse. In an attempt to sow division among the Vandals, Belisarius gave a letter written by Justinian and addressed to the Vandal nobles to a captured Vandal messenger, in which the emperor claimed to be campaigning on behalf of the legitimate king Hilderic against the usurper Gelimer. As the messenger was too afraid to deliver the letter, this ploy came to nothing.&lt;ref name="Bury130-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes85"/&gt;

[[File:Battle of Ad Decimum - Vandal plan.svg|thumb|right|250px|Gelimer's plan to encircle the Romans at Ad Decimum]]
Gelimer, in the meantime, upon learning of the Romans' arrival, immediately notified his brother [[Ammatas]] in Carthage to assemble the Vandal forces in the vicinity, as well as to execute Hilderic and his relatives, while his secretary Bonifatius was ordered to load the royal treasure on a ship and sail for Spain if the Romans won.&lt;ref name="Hughes80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bury131"&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Deprived of his best troops, which were with Tzazon, Gelimer contented himself with shadowing the northward march of the Roman army, all the while preparing a decisive engagement before Carthage, at a place called Ad Decimum ("at the tenth [milepost]") where he had ordered Ammatas to bring his forces.&lt;ref name="Hughes86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bury131"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (1896), pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans advanced through [[Thapsus]], [[Leptis Parva]] and [[Hadrumetum]] to Grasse, where for the first time they engaged in a skirmish with the scouts of Gelimer's army. After exchanging blows, both parties retired to their camps.&lt;ref name="Hughes86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bury131"/&gt; From Grasse, Belisarius turned his army westwards, cutting across the neck of the [[Cape Bon]] peninsula. This was the most dangerous part of the route to Carthage, with the fleet out of sight.&lt;ref name="Hughes87"&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, on the morning of 13 September, the tenth day of the march from Caputvada, the Roman army approached Ad Decimum. There Gelimer planned to ambush and encircle them, using a force under his brother Ammatas to block their advance and engage them, while 2,000 men under his nephew [[Gibamund]] would attack their left flank, and Gelimer himself with the main army would attack from the rear and completely annihilate the Roman army. In the event, the three forces failed to synchronize exactly: Ammatas arrived early and was killed as he attempted a reconnaissance with a small force by the Roman vanguard, while Gibamund's force was intercepted by the Hunnic flank guard and was utterly destroyed. Unaware of all this, Gelimer marched up with the main army and scattered the Roman advance forces present at Ad Decimum. Victory might have been his, but he then came upon his dead brother's body, and apparently forgot all about the battle. This gave Belisarius the time to rally his troops, come up with his main cavalry force and defeat the disorganized Vandals. Gelimer with the remainder of his forces fled westwards to Numidia. The [[Battle of Ad Decimum]] ended in a crushing Roman victory, and Carthage lay open and undefended before Belisarius.&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, pp. 133–135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), pp. 87–96&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belisarius' entry into Carthage and Gelimer's counterattack ===
It was only by nightfall, when John the Armenian with his men and the 600 Huns rejoined his army, that Belisarius realized the extent of his victory. The cavalry spent the night at the battlefield. In the next morning, as the infantry (and Antonina) caught up, the whole army made for Carthage, where it arrived as night was falling. The Carthaginians had thrown open the gates and illuminated the city in celebration, but Belisarius, fearing a possible ambush in the darkness and wishing to keep his soldiers under tight control, refrained from entering the city, and encamped before it.
&lt;ref name="Belisarius135"&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes97"&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the fleet had rounded Cape Bon and, after learning of the Roman victory, had anchored at Stagnum, some 7.5&amp;nbsp;km from the city. Ignoring Belisarius' instructions, Calonymus and his men proceeded to plunder the merchant settlement of Mandriacum nearby.&lt;ref name="Hughes97"/&gt;

On the morning of the next day, 15 September, Belisarius drew up the army for battle before the city walls, but as no enemy appeared, he led his army into the city, after again exhorting his troops to show discipline. The Roman army received a warm welcome from the populace, which was favourably impressed by its restraint. While Belisarius himself took possession of the royal palace, seated himself on the king's throne, and consumed the dinner which Gelimer had confidently ordered to be ready for his own victorious return, the fleet entered the [[Lake of Tunis]] and the army was billeted throughout the city. The remaining Vandals were rounded up and placed under guard to prevent them from causing trouble. Belisarius dispatched Solomon to Constantinople to bear the emperor news of the victory, but expecting an imminent re-appearance of Gelimer with his army, he lost no time in repairing the largely ruined walls of the city and rendering it capable of sustaining a siege.&lt;ref name="Belisarius135"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes98"&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AR 50 Denarii - Vandals - Gelimer - Carthage.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fifty-''[[Denarius|denarii]]'' coin of Gelimer]]
During the following weeks, while Belisarius remained in Carthage strengthening its walls, Gelimer established himself and the remnant of his army at [[Bulla Regia]]. By distributing money he had managed to cement the loyalty of the locals to his cause, and sent messages recalling Tzazon and his men from Sardinia, where they had been successful in re-establishing Vandal authority and killing Godas. While waiting for Tzazon's arrival, the Vandal king's army also increased by the arrival of more and more fugitives from the battle of Ad Decimum, as well as by a contingent of his Moorish allies.&lt;ref name="Hughes99"&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Moorish tribes of Numidia and Byzacena, however, sent embassies to Belisarius, pledging allegiance to the Empire. Some even offered hostages and asked for the insignia of office traditionally awarded to them by the emperor: a gilded silver staff and a silver crown, a white cloak, a white tunic, and a gilded boot. Belisarius had been furnished by Justinian with these items in anticipation of this demand, and duly dispatched them along with sums of money. Nevertheless, it was clear that, as long as the outcome of the war remained undecided, neither side could count on the firm loyalty of the Moors.&lt;ref name="Belisarius135"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes99"/&gt; During this period, messengers from Tzazon, sent to announce his recovery of Sardinia, sailed into Carthage unaware that the city had fallen and were taken captive, followed shortly after by Gelimer's envoys to Theudis, who had reached Spain after the news of the Roman successes had arrived there and hence failed to secure an alliance. Belisarius was also reinforced by the Roman general Cyril with his contingent, who had sailed to Sardinia only to find it once again in possession of the Vandals.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as Tzazon received his brother's message, he left Sardinia and landed in Africa, joining up with Gelimer at Bulla. The Vandal king now determined to advance on Carthage. His intentions are not clear; the traditional interpretation is that he hoped to reduce the city by blockading it, but Ian Hughes believes that, lacking the reserves for a protracted war of attrition, he hoped to force Belisarius into a "single, decisive confrontation". Approaching the city, the Vandal army cut the aqueduct supplying it with water, and attempted to prevent provisions from arriving in the city. Gelimer also dispatched agents to the city to undermine the loyalty of the inhabitants and the imperial army. Belisarius, who was alert to the possibility of treachery, set an example by impaling a citizen of Carthage who intended to join the Vandals. The greatest danger for defection came from the Huns, who were disgruntled because they had been ferried to Africa against their will and feared being left there as a garrison. Indeed, Vandal agents had already made contact with them, but Belisarius managed to maintain their allegiance—at least for the moment—by making a solemn promise that after the final victory they would be richly rewarded and allowed to return to their homes. Their loyalty however remained suspect, and, like the Moors, the Huns probably awaited to see who would emerge as the victor and rally to him.&lt;ref name="Belisarius136"&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tricamarum and the surrender of Gelimer ===
After securing the loyalty of the populace and the army, and completing the repairs to the walls, Belisarius resolved to meet Gelimer in battle, and in mid-December marched out of Carthage in the direction of the fortified Vandal camp at Tricamarum, some 28&amp;nbsp;km from Carthage. As at Ad Decimum, the Roman cavalry proceeded in advance of the infantry, and the ensuing [[Battle of Tricamarum]] was a purely cavalry affair, with Belisarius' army considerably outnumbered. Both armies kept their most untrustworthy elements—the Moors and Huns—in reserve. John the Armenian played the most important role on the Roman side, and Tzazon on the Vandal. John led repeated charges at the Vandal centre, culminating in the death of Tzazon. This was followed by a general Roman attack across the front and the collapse of the Vandal army, which retreated to its camp. Gelimer, seeing that all was lost, fled with a few attendants into the wilds of Numidia, whereupon the remaining Vandals gave up all thoughts of resistance and abandoned their camp to be plundered by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, pp. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), pp. 100–106&lt;/ref&gt; Like the previous battle at Ad Decimum, it is again notable that Belisarius failed to keep his forces together, and was forced to fight with a considerable numerical disadvantage. The dispersal of his army after the battle, looting heedlessly and leaving themselves vulnerable to a potential Vandal counter-attack was also an indication of the poor discipline in the Roman army and the command difficulties Belisarius faced.&lt;ref&gt;For a critical consideration of both sides' strategy and tactics, cf. Diehl (1896), pp. 27–32; Hughes (2009), pp. 85–89, 96, 104–106&lt;/ref&gt; As Bury comments, the expedition's fate might have been quite different "if Belisarius had been opposed to a commander of some ability and experience in warfare", and points out that Procopius himself "expresses amazement at the issue of the war, and does not hesitate to regard it not as a feat of superior strategy but as a paradox of fortune".&lt;ref name="Bury137"&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Justinian Multiple Solidi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Drawing of a medallion commemorating the Roman victory in the Vandalic War, c. 535]]
A Roman detachment under John the Armenian pursued the fleeing Vandal king for five days and nights, and was almost upon him when he was killed in an accident. The Romans halted to mourn their leader, allowing Gelimer to escape, first to [[Hippo Regius]] and from there to the city of Medeus on Mount Papua, on whose Moorish inhabitants he could rely. Belisarius sent 400 men under the Herul [[Pharas]] to blockade him there.&lt;ref name="Bury138"&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes106"&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Belisarius himself made for Hippo Regius, where the Vandals who had fled to various sanctuaries surrendered to the Roman general, who promised that they would be well treated and sent to Constantinople in spring. Belisarius was also fortunate in recovering the Vandal royal treasure, which had been loaded in a ship at Hippo. Bonifatius, Gelimer's secretary, was supposed to sail with it to Spain, where Gelimer too would later follow, but adverse winds kept the ship in harbour and in the end, Bonifatius handed it over to the Romans in exchange for his own safety (as well as a considerable share of the treasure, if Procopius is to be believed).&lt;ref name="Bury137"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; Belisarius also began to extend his authority over the more distant provinces and outposts of the Vandal kingdom: Cyril was dispatched to Sardinia and Corsica with Tzazon's head as proof of his victory, John was sent to [[Cherchell|Caesarea]] on the coast of Mauretania Caesariensis, another John was sent to the twin fortresses of [[Ceuta|Septem]] and [[Gadira]], which controlled the Straits of Gibraltar, and Apollinarius to take possession of the Balearic Islands. Aid was also sent to the provincials in Tripolitania, who had been subject to attacks by the local Moorish tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes107"&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Belisarius also demanded the return of the port of [[Lilybaeum]] in western Sicily from the Ostrogoths, who had captured it during the war, as it too had been part of the Vandal kingdom. An exchange of letters followed between Justinian and the Ostrogoth court, through which Justinian was drawn into the intrigues of the latter, leading to the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Roman invasion of Italy]] a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), pp. 108, 112ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Gelimer remained blockaded by Pharas at the mountain stronghold of Medeus, but as the blockade dragged through the winter, Pharas grew impatient. He attacked the mountain stronghold, only to be beaten back with the loss of a quarter of his men. While a success for Gelimer, it did not alter his hopeless situation as he and his followers remained tightly blockaded and began to suffer from lack of food. Pharas sent him messages calling upon him to surrender and spare his followers the misery, but it was not until March that the Vandal king agreed to surrender after receiving guarantees for his safety. Gelimer was then escorted to Carthage.&lt;ref name="Bury138"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes107"/&gt;

== Aftermath ==

=== Belisarius' triumph ===
[[File:Arch of Titus Menorah.png|250px|thumb|The Menorah of the Temple of Jerusalem, shown carried in the triumphal procession of [[Titus]] along with spoils from the Temple on the [[Arch of Titus]] in [[Rome]]]]
Belisarius would not remain long in Africa to consolidate his success, as a number of officers in his army, in hopes of their own advancement, sent messengers to Justinian claiming that Belisarius intended to establish his own kingdom in Africa. Justinian then gave his general two choices as a test of his intentions: he could return to Constantinople or remain in Africa. Belisarius, who had captured one of the messengers and was aware of the slanders against him, chose to return.&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; He left Africa in the summer, accompanied by Gelimer, large numbers of captured Vandals—who were enrolled in five regiments of the ''Vandali Iustiniani'' ("Vandals of Justinian") by the emperor—and the Vandal treasure, which included many objects looted from Rome 80 years earlier, including the imperial regalia and the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] of the [[Second Temple]].&lt;ref name="Bury139"&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; In Constantinople, Belisarius was given the honour of celebrating a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]—the first to be celebrated in Constantinople since its foundation and the first granted to a private citizen in over five and a half centuries&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1992), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;—and described by Procopius:

{{cquote|And there was booty—first of all, whatever articles are wont to be set apart for the royal service—thrones of gold and carriages in which it is customary for a king's consort to ride, and much jewelry made of precious stones, and golden drinking cups, and all the other things which are useful for the royal table. And there was also silver weighing many thousands of [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] and all the royal treasure amounting to an exceedingly great sum, and among these were the treasures of the Jews, which [[Titus]], the son of [[Vespasian]], together with certain others, had brought to Rome after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|capture of Jerusalem]]. [...] And there were slaves in the triumph, among whom was Gelimer himself, wearing some sort of a purple garment upon his shoulders, and all his family, and as many of the Vandals as were very tall and fair of body. And when Gelimer reached the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|hippodrome]] and saw the emperor sitting upon a lofty seat and the people standing on either side and realized as he looked about in what an evil plight he was, he neither wept nor cried out, but ceased not saying over in the words of the [[Ecclesiastes|Hebrew scripture]]: "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." And when he came before the emperor's seat, they stripped off the purple garment, and compelled him to fall prone on the ground and do obeisance to the Emperor Justinian. This also Belisarius did, as being a suppliant of the emperor along with him.|author=Procopius, ''The Vandalic War'', II.9}}

Gelimer was given an ample estate in [[Galatia]], and would have been raised to [[patrikios|patrician rank]] if he had not steadfastly refused to renounce his Arian faith.&lt;ref name="Bury138"/&gt; Belisarius was also named [[Roman consul|''consul ordinarius'']] for the year 535, allowing him to celebrate a second triumphal procession, being carried through the streets seated on his consular [[curule chair]], held aloft by Vandal warriors, distributing largesse to the populace from his share of the war booty.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2009), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Re-establishment of Roman rule in Africa and the Moorish Wars ===
{{further|Praetorian prefecture of Africa}}

Immediately after Tricamarum, Justinian hastened to proclaim the recovery of Africa: 
{{cquote|Our predecessors did not deserve this favor of God, as they were not only not permitted to liberate Africa, but even saw Rome itself captured by the Vandals, and all the Imperial insignia taken from thence to Africa. Now, however, God, in his mercy, has not only delivered Africa and all her provinces into Our hands, but the Imperial insignia as well, which, having been removed at the capture of Rome, He has restored to us.|author=''[[Codex Iustinianus]]'', I.XXVII}}

The emperor was determined to restore the province to its former extent and prosperity—indeed, in the words of J.B. Bury, he intended "to wipe out all traces of the Vandal conquest, as if it had never been, and to restore the conditions which had existed before the coming of Geiseric". To this end, the Vandals were barred from holding office or even property, which was returned to its former owners; most Vandal males became slaves, while the victorious Roman soldiers took their wives; and the Chalcedonian Church was restored to its former position while the Arian Church was dispossessed and persecuted. As a result of these measures, the Vandal population was diminished and emasculated. It gradually disappeared entirely, becoming absorbed into the broader provincial population.&lt;ref name="Bury139"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (1896), pp. 37–41&lt;/ref&gt; Already in April 534, before the surrender of Gelimer, the old Roman provincial division along with the full apparatus of Roman administration was restored, under a praetorian prefect rather than under a [[Roman diocese|diocesan]] ''[[vicarius]]'', since the original parent prefecture of Africa, Italy, was still under Ostrogothic rule. The army of Belisarius was left behind to form the garrison of the new prefecture, under the overall command of a ''[[magister militum]]'' and several regional ''[[dux|duces]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Almost from the start, an extensive fortification programme was also initiated, including the construction of city walls as well as smaller forts to protect the countryside, whose remnants are still among the most prominent archaeological remains in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, pp. 148–150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed survey, cf. Diehl (1896), pp. 138–298&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Justinian's intentions and proclamations, however, Roman control over Africa was not yet secure. During his campaign, Belisarius had secured most of the provinces of Byzacena, Zeugitana and Tripolitania. Further west, on the other hand, imperial control extended in a series of strongholds captured by the fleet along the coast as far as [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], while most of the inland areas of Numidia and Mauretania remained under the control of the local Moorish tribes, as indeed had been the case under the Vandal kings.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (1896), pp. 34–36&lt;/ref&gt; The Moors initially acknowledged the Emperor's suzerainty and gave hostages to the imperial authorities, but they soon became restive and rose in revolt. The first imperial governor, Belisarius' former ''domesticus'' Solomon, who combined the offices of both ''magister militum'' and praetorian prefect, was able to score successes against them and strengthen Roman rule in Africa, but his work was interrupted by a widespread military mutiny in 536. The mutiny was eventually subdued by [[Germanus (cousin of Justinian I)|Germanus]], a cousin of Justinian, and Solomon returned in 539. He fell, however, in the Battle of Cillium in 544 against the united Moorish tribes, and Roman Africa was again in jeopardy. It would not be until 548 that the resistance of the Moorish tribes would be finally broken by the talented general [[John Troglita]].&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), Vol. II, pp. 140–147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (1896), pp. 41–93, 333–381&lt;/ref&gt;
