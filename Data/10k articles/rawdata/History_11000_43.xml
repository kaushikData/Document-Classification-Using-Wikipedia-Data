The '''Holy Land Association''' ({{lang-it|Associazione di Terra Santa}}, or ''ATS'') is the [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental charitable organisation]] of the [[Custodian of the Holy Land|Custody of the Holy Land]]. In this regard, the President of the association is entitled to the Custody of the Holy Land.{{clarify |date=October 2017 |reason=This sentence makes to sense. What exactly is it that the President is entitled to?}}

The association was formed in 2002 to provide an enclosure for the realization of projects for the protection of the places of [[Holy Land]] and the resident population in all countries of the Custody of the Holy Land : [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], [[Cyprus]], [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Rhodes]] ([[Greece]]) .

In 2002, in agreement with the Jordanian authorities for Madama and Umm Al Rasas, the Faculty of Architecture of the University of [[Firenze]], Jordan Department of Antiquities, the ATS has carried out the restoration and a museum of the Memorial of [[Moses]] on [[Mount Nebo (Jordan)|Mount Nebo]]. In addition, the ATS in 2002, with the support of [[UNESCO]], the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], (Florence, Rome La Sapienza) and abroad (Copenhagen) has launched an intensive information campaign on the terms of the socio-economic deprivation and cultural heritage of the [[Middle East]].

In 2006, under the direction of Father Michele Piccirillo, and with the support of the [[Lazio|Regione Lazio]], has been completed the restoration of the carpet floor of the Church of [[Saint George]] in [[Jericho]], dating back to 536 AD .

Following the war between Israel and Lebanon, between July and August 2006, ATS and the [[Lombardia|Regione Lombardia]] have carried out a program of intervention for the protection of affected populations .

[[File:AkuAkuPåskeøyasHemmelighet..jpg|thumb|First edition (Norwegian)]]

'''''Aku-Aku: the Secret of Easter Island''''' is a 1957 book by [[Thor Heyerdahl]]&lt;ref name="heyerdahl"&gt;Thor Heyerdahl, ''Aku-Aku: The Secret of Easter Island'', {{ISBN|0345238419}} / 9780345238412 / 0-345-23841-9.  Hardcover published July 1, 1958 by Rand McNally &amp; Co.; Paperback published 1960 by Penguin Books Limited; Mass market paperback edition May 1961 by Pocket Books, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; published in English the following year. The book describes the 1955–1956 [[Thor Heyerdahl#Expedition to Rapa Nui|Norwegian Archaeological Expedition]]'s investigations of [[Polynesia]]n history and culture at [[Easter Island]], the [[Austral Islands]] of [[Rapa Iti]] and [[Raivavae]], and the [[Marquesas Islands]] of [[Nuku Hiva]] and [[Hiva Oa]]. Visits to [[Pitcairn Island]], [[Mangareva]] and [[Tahiti]] are described as well. By far the greatest part of the book tells of the work on Easter Island, where the expedition investigated the giant stone statues (''[[moai]]''), the quarries at [[Rano Raraku]] and [[Puna Pau]], the ceremonial village of [[Orongo]] on [[Rano Kau]], as well as many other sites throughout the island. Much of the book's interest derives from the interaction of the expedition staff, from their base at [[Anakena]] beach, with the Easter Islanders themselves, who lived mainly in the village of [[Hanga Roa]].

The book and a follow-up film of the same name&lt;ref&gt;''Aku-Aku'' (documentary), 1960 (U.S. release 1961).  [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142071/ IMDb link]&lt;/ref&gt; made a major contribution to general public awareness of both the island and the statues.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Steven Roger, ''Island at the end of the World: The Turbulent History of Easter Island''. Reaktion Books Ltd. 2005. {{ISBN|1-86189-282-9}}. page 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book was widely distributed, with both hardcover and mass market editions published,&lt;ref name="heyerdahl" /&gt; as well as several reprint editions.

Some of Heyerdahl's conclusions have been questioned by archaeologists, plus his methods of selecting evidence to confirm his point of view. Notable is that professionalism in the fieldwork cannot be disputed since he used educated archaeologists.

==Theories==
{{Main|History of Easter Island}}

Heyerdahl is mostly associated with an attempt to revive the theory that some of islanders' stone-carving technology is almost identical to the one in some parts of South America, notably Peru. He argued that in addition to having been settled by [[Polynesians]], [[Easter Island]] was settled by people from [[Peru]] in [[South America]] (an area he described as being "more culturally developed").&lt;ref name= "flenley"&gt;Flenley and Bahn,  ''The Enigmas of Easter Island'' 2003 {{ISBN|0-19-280340-9}}, page 30, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Easter Islanders, according to Heyerdahl, insisted that the ''[[moai]]'' (statues) of Easter Island moved into their positions by "walking."  Heyerdahl theorised that this referred to a statue having been moved in an upright orientation, by the technique of swiveling it alternatively on its corners in a "walking" fashion, a technique that can be used in moving a tall, flat-bottomed object (like a free-standing closet).  He tested this theory on a small ''moai''; however, he quickly abandoned the test after the moai's base was damaged.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Anne Van Tilburg. "Easter Island, Archaeology, Ecology and Culture". British Museum Press, London, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7141-2504-0}}, page 154&lt;/ref&gt; He made a group of inhabitants pull a rather large statue lying down (which was easy to do) and thus show that this method was useful. He also made natives erect a statue using levers and stones demonstration that this method also worked. At this time all statues were lying down and this one was the first to be restored.

===Evidence===

Heyerdahl compared the highest-quality stonework on the island (present in very few cases) to [[pre-Columbian]] [[Amerindian]] stonework, such as at [[Tihuanaco]]. He said of [[Easter Island#Ahu|Ahu]] Vinapu's retaining wall, "No Polynesian fisherman would have been capable of conceiving, much less building such a wall".&lt;ref name= "flenley" /&gt;

Heyerdahl claimed a South American origin for a number of Easter Island plants, including the Totora reeds in the island's three crater lakes.  These are now (by DNA analysis not available at the time) recognised as a separate species from similar ones in [[Lake Titicaca]].  He made the same claim for [[sweet potato]] and this fact is a riddle since this is South American. A cultural feature on Easter Island was enlonging of the earlobe. This is not present in Polynesia but common in South America. On the other hand, weaving and pottery (used in the Americas) was not known to the inhabitants of Easter Island.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37373">[[Image:ColbertSnyder.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Colbert with Congressman [[Vic Snyder]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Arkansas]]), whose district became "Better Known" on February 15, 2007]]

'''Better Know a District''' (also known as '''BKAD''') was a recurring segment on ''[[The Colbert Report]]''. It offered a humorous examination of a different [[List of United States congressional districts|United States Congressional district]] in each segment and generally included an interview with that district's [[United States House of Representatives|member of Congress]].

== Structure ==
Each segment began with basic information about a specific district, such as history and geography, and sometimes a humorously bizarre event that happened there. The district is also almost invariably referred to as "fightin'," as in the "Fightin' 11th." All segments featured an interview with its [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]].

One comedic maneuver that Colbert commonly employed in these interviews, particularly when he interviewed Democrats, was to ask the Representative a [[loaded question]] of either "[[George W. Bush]]: great President, or ''the greatest'' President?", or "the [[Iraq War]]: great war, or ''the greatest'' war?" When the interviewee tried to express his or her disapproval of Bush, Colbert usually stated that the only choice was between "Great or Greatest," and nearly always stated, "I'm gonna put you down for 'Great'." (He often referred to previous Democratic representatives whom he put down as saying Bush was a 'great' president.)

After the interview, Colbert added the segment to "the big board", a map of the entire United States with district lines drawn; the new district, shown in sparkling gold on a blue background, was usually very difficult or impossible to see due to its small size. Though many districts were profiled, the map always looked largely vacant overall.

==Reactions of interviewees==
Although the interviews intentionally showed most of the Representatives in an unflattering light, the Representatives' post-interview reactions have varied. Colbert's interview with [[Massachusetts]] Representative [[Barney Frank]] resulted in Frank lambasting the program (he was quoted on a later ''Report''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/11/10/interviews_no_laughing_matter_for_local_notables/ Interviews no laughing matter for local notables] at ''Boston Globe''&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=February 2012}} while the interview with [[Virginia]] Representative [[Jim Moran]] pleased the Congressman — he told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that he thought Colbert "let (him) off kind of light."&lt;ref&gt;"Laugh, and the Voters Laugh With You, or at Least at You", ''[[The New York Times]]'', Week in Review p.1, Feb. 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[California]] Representative [[Brad Sherman]] appeared to be in on the joke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wonkette.com/politics/television/stephen-colberts-bipartisan-outreach-effort-158335.php Stephen Colbert's Bipartisan Outreach Effort] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221107/http://www.wonkette.com/politics/television/stephen-colberts-bipartisan-outreach-effort-158335.php |date=September 26, 2007 }} at Wonkette.com&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed not to know that his [[San Fernando Valley]] district was home to the [[pornography]] industry, gave an apparently long and dull explanation of a [[Internal Revenue Code|tax]] proposal, and participated in the making of a "pornographic video" with Colbert and impersonated a robot.

''[[The Washington Times]]'' published a story on the show stating that "several lawmakers said doing the spoof spot on 'The Colbert Report' on TV's Comedy Central actually has raised their profiles back home";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washtimes.com/national/20060703-123222-3556r.htm Politicians relish comic's needling] ''The Washington Times''&lt;/ref&gt; however, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' has reported that due to the fact that many House members have "stumbled badly" during this segment, others are not risking "the price for looking stupid" and were passing up the opportunity to be on Colbert's ''Better Know A District''.&lt;ref name="Price for looking stupid"&gt;{{cite news|last=Puzzanghera |first=Jim |title=Los Angeles Times |work=Running for office? Better run from Colbert |date=2006-10-22 |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-fi-colbert22oct22,0,3608221.story |accessdate=2006-10-23 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his November 7, 2006 show, Colbert lauded the fact that every one of the 28 actual congressmen whom he had interviewed by that point won election or reelection, which he claims to have been because they were given the "[[Colbert Bump]]".

Because of the way Colbert intentionally tried to skewer congressmen in his interviews, former [[Democratic Caucus of the United States House of Representatives|Democratic Caucus]] chairman [[Rahm Emanuel]] advised his fellow Democrats not to appear on the show,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.webindia123.com/news/Articles/Entertainment/20070315/615874.html 'Colbert Report' is lawmakers' Siren], [[United Press International]], Mar. 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; causing Colbert to make fun of Emanuel's advice on the show.  Better Know a District segments subsequently began appearing much less frequently on the ''Report'', suggesting many in Congress took Emanuel's advice. In January 2009, Colbert received what he jocularly claimed was a letter from U.S. Speaker of the House of Representatives [[Nancy Pelosi]] and said he was cleared to begin interviewing congressmen once again. However he began the 2009 season of Better Know A District by interviewing Republican congressman [[Jason Chaffetz]] instead of a Democratic congressman.

Following the 2010 congressional election on November 2, 2010, for the first time since the show began, a congressman who appeared on the ''Colbert Report''{{'}}s Better Know a District segment was not reelected in a general election (in fact, several).  On November 3, 2010, Colbert ran a segment showing clips of those fallen friends called "We Hardly Better Knew Ye".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/364377/november-03-2010/we-hardly-better-knew-ye We Hardly Better Knew Ye] at ColbertNation.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==District count==

''Better Know a District'' began as a "435-part series," 435 being the number of [[List of United States Congressional districts|United States Congressional districts]]; however, on November 29, 2005, Colbert banned [[California's 50th congressional district|California's 50th District]] after his "friend" [[Randy "Duke" Cunningham]], the 50th's Representative, pled guilty to receiving over $2 million in bribes and resigned his seat. California's 50th is now the lone member of the "Never Existed to Me" category, and the map showing the United States' Congressional districts now looks as if the district does not even exist. This brought the series to a "434-part series". After this, [[Texas's 22nd congressional district]] was retired on April 4, 2006 when [[Tom DeLay]] announced that he planned to leave Congress. Texas's 22nd was reinstated on June 8, 2006, with a fake interview in which video of DeLay in three previous interviews on other television networks was interspersed with questions from Colbert. The district was put back into retirement at the end of the segment.

In the show's first year, 34 districts were profiled.

The original district map lacked Michigan’s [[Upper Peninsula]]. During a phone-in segment, a resident of [[Michigan's 1st congressional district|Michigan’s 1st]], which includes all of the Upper Peninsula as well as a sizable portion of the northern Lower Peninsula, reported this absence. Colbert informed the caller that he lived in Canada and if it was not on Colbert’s map, it was not a part of the United States. The Upper Peninsula was added to the map the next time it was shown.

During the interview with [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]], Colbert established that the [[District of Columbia]] was not a state, and thus the District of Columbia was not a part of the United States. The ''Better Know a District'' map was updated with an [[asterisk]] notation to reflect this fact. Furthermore, the count of 435 districts does not include non-voting districts, such as the District of Columbia; however, this segment was included in the district count, filling in for California's 50th district's absence, restoring the total to 435.

After the 2006 midterm elections, Colbert was invited to a meeting of the incoming House freshmen at Harvard's [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]]. During this encounter, he brought his total of "better-known districts" from 36 up to 51 (including a British [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|parliamentary constituency]]); however, he did not count these as installments, and the count picked up at 37 with the next regular installment. The show aired on December 12, 2006.

After completing the fourth installment on November 9, 2005, he quipped “At the rate of one district a week, we should complete the series by February 2014.” However, in February 2014 he was only on the 87th of 434 districts, leaving him 20% complete after 8.5 years. That rate would place the series completion date in April 2048, had the show not ended.

==List of districts "Better Known"==
The districts covered in "Better Know a District" are shown below. Segment numbers are listed starting with the 37th installment as they no longer correspond to the actual number of districts profiled. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' has reprinted transcripts from segments of "Better Know a District".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/29/AR2006042900126.html The Colbert Rapport transcripts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Colbert ends the segment with filling in all of the districts on the Better Know a District map, and is astonished when it turns out to be a map of the 48 [[Contiguous United States]] and [[Hawaii]]. [[Alaska]] is missing from the map.

==Spin-offs==

===Better Know a Challenger===
In the months leading up to the [[United States House elections, 2006|2006 congressional elections]], Colbert interviewed the challengers in several [[United States House of Representatives|House]] races. On several occasions he made clear that the challenger was interviewed because the [[incumbent]] declined to appear. However this was not always definitively the case. In these cases, the segment is known as "Better Know a Challenger," with different intro graphics.

After the segment, the district was colored on the "Better Know a District" map in [[Goldenrod (color)|goldenrod]] instead of [[Amber (color)|amber]], which is said to be the color all other districts are filled in with. It was upgraded to amber if the challenger won the 2006 election, or downgraded to [[Cadmium pigments|cadmium yellow]] if they lost. Of course, it is nearly impossible to see the distinction between these shades on the map. Of the five challengers interviewed, only [[John Hall (New York politician)|John Hall]] defeated an incumbent.

In the instance of [[New Jersey's 3rd congressional district]], Colbert frequently referred to challenger [[Rich Sexton]] as representative [[Jim Saxton]], a joke on the similarity of their names.

On May 8, 2014 Colbert resurrected the segment, interviewing Jack Rush who ran in the Florida 3rd district against incumbent [[Ted Yoho]]. In the interview, Colbert pretended that guns are people. Colbert also treated characters that Rush played in the past as real people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/05/09/colbert-mocks-tea-party-candidate-jack-rush-and-his-vampire-alter-ego-chazz-darling/|title=Colbert mocks Tea Party candidate Jack Rush and his vampire alter-ego, ‘Chazz Darling’|date=May 9, 2014|first=Scott|last=Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Better Know a Protectorate===
On March 16, 2006, Colbert introduced a four-part series entitled "Better Know a [[Protectorate]]", focusing on the protectorates (more correctly, unincorporated territories) of the United States (which send non-voting delegates to Congress). The formula is relatively the same as with "Better Know a District." Distinctive elements include Colbert attacking the member for their (non-)voting record, and feigning cultural ignorance.  For the first segment, the same "Big Board" as BKAD was used, but was discontinued with the airing of the second segment. The [[United States Virgin Islands]] ("the fightin' virgins") was the protectorate that was covered and its delegate, [[Donna Christian-Christensen]], was interviewed.

On April 26, 2007, [[Guam]] ("the fightin' Guam") was covered, including an interview with [[Madeleine Bordallo]]. A global map was used to produce the "Big Board", given Guam's distance from the continental United States. On August 7, 2007, [[American Samoa]] was featured ("the fightin' Samoa") and an interview with [[Eni Faleomavaega|Eni Fa'aua'a Hunkin Faleomavaega, Jr.]] was shown.

The remaining protectorate is presumably [[Puerto Rico]] which has not been featured (the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] did not have a non-voting member as of the start of the series, although they received a seat after the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2008#Races of non-voting members|2008 elections]]).

===Better Know a Founder===
On March 1, 2006, Colbert introduced the "56-part" ''Better Know a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founder]]'', an in-depth look at the signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. For this series [[John Trumbull]]'s painting of [[:Image:Declaration independence.jpg|The Declaration of Independence]] is used as the template for the "Big Board".

Using the same formula as Better Know a District, Colbert's first subject in the series was a spotlight of an interview with [[Benjamin Franklin|"Battlin'" Ben Franklin]]; the actor [[Ralph Archbold]] portrayed Franklin for the interview, with both he and Colbert wearing period clothing. Most of the hallmarks of the original segment remained, either in an altered form (e.g., [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]]: Great king, or the ''greatest'' king?) or unchanged (e.g., Colbert [[anachronistically]] asks Franklin if he had taken money from [[Jack Abramoff]]).

On November 15, 2006, the second installment of BKAF featured three actors portraying [[President of the United States|President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] in an [[America's Next Top Model]] style segment, ''America's Top Jefferson,'' with [[Project Runway]] mentor and producer [[Tim Gunn]] making an appearance.

===Better Know a President===
On May 17, 2006, Colbert introduced ''Better Know a President'', a 43-part series that would refresh the viewer's memory of the accomplishments of every [[President of the United States|President]] in United States history. The first president covered was [[Theodore Roosevelt]], played by Roosevelt impersonator Jim Foote. In keeping with the running gags of the segment, he asked Roosevelt if the [[Spanish–American War]] was merely a great war of American imperialism, or the ''greatest'' war of American imperialism. The second covered was Thomas Jefferson. Colbert talked to three different Jefferson impersonators, and judged which was the best.

===Meet an Ally===
On August 3, 2006 Stephen began the first segment in a series entitled "Meet an Ally" in which he examines nations part of the "[[Coalition of the Willing]]". He began the series by interviewing the ambassador of [[Palau]], [[Stuart Beck]].

===Betterer Know a District===
When Colbert shows an extended segment of an interview at a later date, he calls the segment "Betterer Know a District".

===Better Know a Memory===
On November 8, 2006, some representatives who were profiled in Better Know a District and had since been re-elected in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2006|the previous day's election]] were reintroduced in a short segment that immediately preceded the commercial breaks. A humorous clip from the BKAD interview would be shown and the words "RETURNED TO CONGRESS" would be rubber stamped onto the still image of the representative. The subjects reintroduced were [[Eliot L. Engel]], [[Brad Sherman]], [[Lynn Westmoreland]], and [[Robert Wexler]].

=== Better Know a Governor ===
On January 21, 2008, after the [[South Carolina Republican primary, 2008|Republican South Carolina Primary]], Colbert interviewed Governor [[Mark Sanford]] as the easiest way to learn about all of South Carolinians.

=== Better Know a Lobby ===
On February 6, 2008, Colbert began what he called an "Infinite-long" segment called "Better Know a Lobbyist," where he interviews [[lobbyist]]s. His first interview was with [[Joe Solmonese]] of the [[Human Rights Campaign]], a [[gay rights]] organization. This was a two-part interview, with the second half being broadcast on February 7.  On March 12, 2008, it changed to "Better Know a Lobby" and became a 35,000-part-long segment.  The second interview was with [[Ethan Nadelmann]] of the [[Drug Policy Alliance]], a lobby demanding the legalization of drugs.  His third interview was with [[Paul Helmke]] of the [[Brady Campaign]], a gun control lobby.

===Better Know a Beatle===
On January 28, 2009, Colbert began what he called the first of a four-part series "Better Know A Beatle", where Colbert intends to interview all of the [[Beatles]] starting with his interview with [[Paul McCartney]], bass player, singer-songwriter of the Beatles. Colbert introduced Paul McCartney as "The Fightin' Walrus", a reference to two Beatle songs, ''[[I Am the Walrus]]'', and ''[[Glass Onion]]''.

===Better Know a Cradle of Civilization===
During his trip to Iraq, Colbert began his one part series, Better Know a Cradle of Civilization, during which he explained the history of Iraq.

===Better Know a Stephen===
On December 16, 2009, Colbert began a new segment in which he interviews other prominent men named Stephen (specifically spelled with a "ph"). He started off by interviewing [[Stephen King]].

===Better Know a Riding===
On February 22, 2010, Colbert began his one part series, Better Know a [[Electoral district (Canada)|Riding]], during his coverage of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]].  The featured riding (a riding is an electoral district in Canada) was [[Vancouver South]], represented by [[Ujjal Dosanjh]].

===Better Know a Kissinger===
One part series on Henry Kissinger prior to Colbert's interview of Henry Kissinger.

===Better Know a Salinger===
During the second edition of c'O'lbert Book Club, centred around JD Salinger, Colbert profiled the author in 'part one of my one-part series, Better Know a Salinger'. The first and only issue was based on the Fighting JD.

===Better Know a Hemingway===
Third edition of Colbert Book Club features this "part one of a one-part series".

===Better Know a America===
On December 8, 2014, while hosting the show in Washington DC, Colbert debuted another one-part series, Better Know a America [sic].

'''Charles Alan Fyffe''' (1845–1892) was an English historian, known also as a journalist and political candidate.

==Life==
He was the son of Lawrence Hay Fyffe, M.D. of [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], by Mary Prudence, daughter of John Ord, born at Lee Park, Blackheath, on 3 December 1845. He was educated at [[Christ's Hospital]], and obtained an open [[exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], 1864. He graduated B.A. in 1868 and M.A. in 1870.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle= Fyffe, Charles Alan|supplement=1|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 Fyffe was elected a fellow of [[University College, Oxford|University College]], and for many years acted as bursar. He acted as correspondent to the ''[[The Daily News (UK)|Daily News]]'' during the first part of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and was in Paris during the [[Paris commune|commune]], where he was taken for a spy.
&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Fyffe entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] on 10 June 1873. He later transferred to the [[Inner Temple]] (26 May 1876), where he was [[called to the bar]] on 10 May 1877. He joined the south-west circuit, but never practised.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Politics==
Fyffe had strong Liberal views, and was president of the [[Oxford Union]] in 1867.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; In 1870, in ''[[Macmillan's Magazine]]'', he wrote that "Liberalism has become co-extensive with intelligence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Whyte|title=Oxford Jackson: Architecture, Education, Status, and Style 1835-1924: Architecture, Education, Status, and Style 1835-1924|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WaILJIABouUC&amp;pg=PA91|date=31 August 2006|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-151633-7|page=91 and note 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His activism was influenced by [[T. H. Green]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R. C. Whiting|title=Oxford: Studies in the History of a University Town Since 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBYNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA28|date=1 January 1993|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-3057-4|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fyffe held views as a land law reformer, and was one of the founders of the free land league.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; His views on land reform were broadly supported by [[Sir Charles Dilke]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/24th-january-1885/5/mr-fyffes-pamphlet-on-the-land-mr-fyffes-pamphlet- The Spectator, 24 January 1885, ''Mr Fyffe's Pamphlet on the Land''.]&lt;/ref&gt; they were more in line with the ideas of [[Henry George]] than those of [[Henry Hyndman]], or the [[land nationalisation]] of [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;Elwood P. Lawrence, ''George, Chamberlain and the Land Tax, II: A Chapter in British Party Politics'', The American Journal of Economics and Sociology Vol. 13, No. 4 (Jul., 1954), pp. 401-413, at p. 401. Published by: American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Inc. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3484639&lt;/ref&gt; His evidence for the Report on Small Holdings of 1888–90 was that demand for [[smallholding]]s could be very high.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ellis Barker, ''Great and Greater Britain: the problems of motherland and empire, political, naval, military, industrial, financial, social'' (1910), pp. 402–3; [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924032473435#page/n419/mode/2up archive.org.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was an unsuccessful candidate for the city of Oxford in the Radical interest at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|general election of 1885]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Court case and death==
In 1891 Fyffe was a prospective parliamentary candidate at {{constlk|Devizes}}.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=10259|title=Fyffe, Charles Alan|first=Myfanwy|last=Lloyd}}&lt;/ref&gt; A charge was brought to court against him at Wiltshire Assizes. It was thrown out, but Fyffe attempted suicide.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; Early biographies were reticent about the details. Newspaper reports from overseas were that the charge was of improper assault; [[John Richard Robinson]] appeared as a witness for Fyffe. The charge was brought by a young fellow-passenger on the Brighton Railway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%207/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Eagle/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Eagle%201891%20Grayscale/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Eagle%201891%20Grayscale%20-%201417.pdf From Brooklyn Daily Eagle, under "By Cable from Europe" (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page4060082 South Australian Register 18 July 1891 under "Another Scandal: The Charge Against a University Fellow".]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fyffe did not recover from his suicide attempt, and died on 19 February 1892 at Laughton Hall, Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; He was buried at [[Buncton]] in [[Sussex]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
In 1875 Fyffe published a small school history of Greece, which sold well. His ''History of Modern Europe'' was in three volumes (1880, 1886, 1890) and passed through subsequent editions.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Family==
Fyffe married, on 7 June 1883, Henrietta Frances Arnaud, only child of Waynflete Arnaud Blagden of Holmbush Ashington, Sussex, by whom he left three children.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Charlotte Baker''' (11 April 1833 – 1909), was an American [[historian]], [[journalist]], and teacher.

==Life and work==
Charlotte Alice Baker was born in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] on 11 April 1833. She was home educated until age 11 and then attended a local school and then the [[Deerfield Academy]], where she was one of only two female students. Together with one of her friends, Baker founded a school in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in 1856, but had to close it eight years later when she had to return home to assist her mother. She then began to write book reviews and articles on [[botany]], art, and women's work for magazines and newspapers. Baker also wrote a children's series entitled, ''Pictures from French and English History''. She became interested in the 1704 [[Raid on Deerfield]] where [[France|French]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] forces attacked the [[England|English]] frontier settlement at [[Deerfield, Massachusetts]], taking 112 settlers captive to [[Montreal]], [[French Canada]].&lt;ref name=sc1&gt;Scanlon &amp; Cosner, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker made multiple trips to Canada to research in the official records and visited villages and Indian missions. She read a paper ''[[Eunice Kanenstenhawi Williams|Eunice Williams]], the Captive'' before the Pocomtock Valley Memorial Association and then published ''True Stories of New England Captives Carried to Canada During the Old French and Indian Wars'' in 1897. Baker "found eighteen Deerfield captives and identified many more whose fate had been unknown. She became known as an expert in New England history and was invited to join the [[New-York Historical Society|New York]], Cambridge, and Montreal [[Historical society|Historical Societies]]."&lt;ref name=sc1/&gt; Baker prepared a series of lectures on early American History for [[Boston]] school children at the request of another historian before her death in 1909.&lt;ref name=sc1/&gt;

'''Cornwall Archaeological Society''' is an amateur archaeological society based in [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]] for the study of [[archaeology]] in Cornwall and the [[Isles of Scilly]]. It was founded in 1961 by members of the West Cornwall Field Club.&lt;ref name="cas"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://cornisharchaeology.org.uk/about-us/history/|website=Cornwall Archaeological Society|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===West Cornwall Field Club===
The West Cornwall Field Club was founded by [[Lt Col]] F C Hirst and six of the volunteers who were excavating a site at [[Porthmeor]], in the [[Zennor|parish of Zennor]] from 1933 to 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Porthmeor|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=423591|website=Pastscape|publisher=Historic England|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership increased to nineteen in 1937 and averaged fifty in the 1950s. Between 1953 and 1961 the club produced twenty-seven publications including six field guides and an annual journal, and the club members took part in forty excavations. During the fifties many members lived in mid and east Cornwall and the field club was publishing increasingly more articles from those areas. It was felt that the name no longer relevant to the scope of the field club and at the [[annual general meeting]] on 10 August 1961 it was unanimously approved to change the title to Cornwall Archaeological Society.&lt;ref name=v1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=A C|title=Editorial|journal=Cornish Archaeology|volume=1|pages=1–4|url=http://cornisharchaeology.org.uk/volume-1-1962/|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cornwall Archaeological Society===
The first President of the society was [[Ralegh Radford|C A Ralegh Radford]] an English archaeologist and historian who specialised in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]].&lt;ref name=v1/&gt;

==Excavations==
The Society has organised a number of excavations. One, considered to be outstanding was at [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] led by [[Roger Mercer]] from 1970 to 1973, which established a new class of site — the [[Neolithic Europe|Early Neolithic]] [[tor enclosure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carn Brea, Early Neolithic tor enclosure, c 3700 BC|url=http://www.royalarchinst.org/jubilee/cas|website=Royal Archaeology Society|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The Society publishes a journal ''Cornish Archaeology Hendhyscans Kernow'' in most years. The first was published in 1962 and the latest, number 54, was published in 2015. A newsletter is published three times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newsletter|url=http://www.cornisharchaeology.org.uk/newsletter.htm|website=Cornwall Archaeological Society|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8808">'''Donald Collier''' (May 1, 1911 – January 23, 1995) was an [[archaeology|archaeologist]], [[ethnology|ethnologist]], and [[museology|museologist]]. He was known primarily for his work in [[Ecuador]]ian and [[Andes|Andean]] archaeology and spent most of his career at the [[Field Museum of Natural History]].

==Family life and education==

Donald Collier was born in [[Sparkill, New York]] to Lucy Wood Collier and [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier, Sr.]] His family moved to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in the early 1920s. He received his undergraduate degree from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1933 and completed his [[doctorate|Ph.D.]] in [[anthropology]] at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="Winters"&gt;(1991). C. Winters (Ed.), ''International dictionary of anthropologists''. Chicago: Library-Anthropology Resource Group.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Collier’s family members had very noteworthy careers. His grandfather, [[Charles Collier]] (1848-1900), was a prominent banker and lawyer in [[Atlanta]] and was elected mayor of that city in 1897. His father John Collier, Sr. (1884-1968) was Commissioner for the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] during the presidency of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. His brother [[John Collier (anthropologist)|John Collier, Jr.]] (1913-1992) is considered a pioneer in the field of [[visual anthropology]] and was also an accomplished photographer. Collier’s brother-in-law [[Rene d'Harnoncourt]] (1901-1968) was the director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] from 1949 to 1967 and was the first chairman of the [[Indian Arts and Crafts Board]]. Collier married [[Malcolm Carr Collier]] (1908-1983) who was also an anthropologist and author. The primary focus of her work was with the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and she served as the director of the Curriculum Study Project of the [[American Anthropological Association]]. She and Donald Collier had two sons, Bruce Collier and [[political science|political scientist]] [[David Collier (political scientist)|David Collier]].&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;Sullivan, R. (1995, February 11). Donald Collier, museum curator and Chicago anthropologist, 83. ''New York Times''. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/11/obituaries/donald-collier-museum-curator-and-chicago-anthropologist-83.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

===Fieldwork===
After finishing his undergraduate degree in 1933, Donald Collier became a field assistant with the [[Museum of Northern Arizona]]. He performed archaeological survey work at Tsegie and Skeleton Mesa with the First Rainbow Bridge Monument Valley Exhibition. In 1935 he received ethnological field training among the [[Kiowa people|Kiowa]] with the [[Museum of Indian Arts and Culture|Laboratory of Anthropology]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. His fieldwork in Andean archaeology got its start in 1937 when he worked with Peruvian archaeologist [[Julio C. Tello]] at the behest of prominent anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] with whom Collier studied at UC Berkeley. Collier and Tello did survey and excavation work in [[Casma Valley]] in [[Peru]] and Collier later returned there for additional archaeological work in 1956.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, D. (1996). Donald Collier 1911-1995. ''American Antiquity, 61''(1), 44-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a project on the upper [[Columbia River]] in [[Washington (state)]], Collier’s work took him to Ecuador from 1941 to 1942. He worked with [[John Victor Murra]] to identify [[Chavin culture]] sites. In 1946, he became a part of the [[Virú Valley|Viru Valley Project]] “a cutting edge cooperative undertaking at the time, the results of which were to have a profound and long-enduring effect on the interpretation of Peruvian prehistory”.&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;{{rp|45}} The research he did for the project, during which he undertook [[archaeological survey]] work with [[Gordon Willey]], served as the basis for his Ph.D. dissertation.

===Exhibits===

Collier was the curator of South and Central American archaeology and ethnology at the Field Museum from 1941 to 1976. He was chief curator of the anthropology department from 1964 to 1970 and became curator emeritus in 1976. The first major exhibition Collier helped develop was ''Indians Before Columbus'', a general exhibit on Indians of the Americas with particular emphasis on the eastern United States. Another exhibition Collier worked on was ''Indian Art of the Americas'' which was a part of the Festival of the Americas for the third [[Pan American Games]] in Chicago in 1959.

In 1963, Collier proposed the idea of a temporary exhibits hall to the director of the Field Museum. Completed in 1964, he developed five major exhibits there from 1966 to 1975. The first, ''Mayan Art: Rubbings from Stone Carvings'', involved the first use at the Field Museum of a projector with a synchronized tape lecture. The ''Festival of American Indian Art'' exhibit was organized in cooperation with the American Indian Center in Chicago and focused on traditional as well as contemporary Native American art. The exhibit also included artists and craftspeople working in the museum in addition to performances by musicians and dancers. ''Fiesta Mexicana'' also included craftspeople, musicians, and dancers. The exhibit focused on colonial and contemporary folk art and included a lecture and film series. The ''Cuna Art and Life'' exhibit about the [[Kuna people|Cuna people]] of [[Panama]] included loaned materials from three museums, two art galleries, and six private collections.

Collier’s final exhibit at the Field Museum was ''Ancient Ecuador: Culture, Clay and Creativity, 3000-300 B.C.'' Most of the pieces in the exhibition were borrowed from a private collection in [[Guayaquil|Guayaquil, Ecuador]] and focused on ceramics from Ecuadorian coastal prehistory. Collier co-authored the exhibit catalog with [[Donald Lathrap]] and he made sure that the catalog, along with the exhibit labels, would be in both Spanish and English. The exhibition traveled to several cities in the United States before becoming a permanent exhibit at the Museo Arqueologico of the [[Central Bank of Ecuador|Banco Central del Ecuador]] in Guayaquil.&lt;ref name="Collier"&gt;Coller, D. (2003). My life with exhibits at the Field Museum, 1941-1976. In S. Nash &amp; G. Feinman (Eds.), ''Curators, collections, and contexts: Anthropology at the Field Museum'' (pp.199-219). Chicago: Field Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching, committees, and notable publications===

From 1950 to 1970, Collier taught classes in anthropology at the University of Chicago. Additionally, from 1945 to 1965, he organized and helped to teach one of the earliest museology courses focusing on museum theory and practice.&lt;ref name="Winters"/&gt;

Collier was the chairman of the Institute of Andean Research, a founding trustee of the Council on Museum Anthropology, and served as president for the Central States Anthropological Society.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;

Inspired by the ''Indians Before Columbus'' exhibit, a book of the same name was published in 1947 by Collier, Paul Martin, and George Quimby. It was used as a text in anthropology courses and was the only book on North American archaeology for nearly ten years. Collier also wrote forty-eight articles for the ''Museum Bulletin'' for the Field Museum. Some of his articles were reprinted in ''Archaeology'', ''Museum Journal'', and the ''Journal of Biblical Archaeology''.&lt;ref name="Collier"/&gt;

The city itself lies at the centre of its own [[Communes of Niger|Urban Commune]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/den/Documents/code_rural/cdrom/doc%20pdf/Loi%20N%B02002-14%20cr%E9ation%20des%20communes.pdf Loi n° 2002-014 du 11 JUIN 2002 portant création des communes et fixant le nom de leurs chefs-lieux]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

==History==
{{Main|Dosso Kingdom}}
Dosso is the seat of the [[Dosso kingdom]], a Zarma chieftaincy which rose to dominate the entire Zarma region in Niger in pre-colonial Niger. The traditional ruler is called ''[[Zarmakoy]]'' or ''Djermakoy'' of Dosso, an autochthonous title meaning literally "King of Djermas" where ''koy'' means "king" in [[Zarma language|Zarma]] (or Djerma) language.

==Sites==
Attractions in the town include the Djermakoy's palace and museum, nominated as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5041/ Palais du Zarmakoye de Dosso], 26 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transport ==
The city of Dosso is a critical commercial hub through which transit import-export products from the [[Cotonou port]]. Due to this and its proximity to Niamey, Dosso is transportation hub. Dosso has an interim terminus of the [[Niamey]]–[[Cotonou]] railway presently{{When|date=November 2015}} under construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2010/10/extending-from-benin-to-niger/

}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extension to the capital, Niamey, would be a later stage.

In addition, there is a plan for the construction of a dry commercial port.

{{Marxism|Philosophy}}

'''Economic determinism''' is a socioeconomic theory that [[economic]] relationships (such as being an owner or [[capitalist]], or being a worker or proletarian) are the foundation upon which all other social and political arrangements in society are based. The theory stresses that societies are divided into competing [[social class|economic classes]] whose relative political power is determined by the nature of the economic system. In the version associated with [[Karl Marx]], the emphasis is on the [[proletariat]] who are considered to be locked in a [[class struggle]] with the capitalist class, which will eventually end with the revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist system and the gradual development of [[socialism]]. [[Marxist theory|Marxist thinkers]] have dismissed plain and unilateral economic [[determinism]] as a form of "vulgar Marxism", or "[[economism]]", nowhere included in Marx's works.

In the writing of American history the term is associated with historian [[Charles A. Beard]] (1874–1948), who was not a Marxist but who emphasized the long-term political contest between bankers and business interest on the one hand, and agrarian interests on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Coleman, "Beard, McDonald, and Economic Determinism in American Historiography," ''Business History Review'' (1960) 34#1 pp. 113-121 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3111785 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to Marxist philosophy==
According to [[Marx]], each social [[mode of production]] produces the [[materialism|material conditions]] of its reproduction, that is, [[ideology]] (which gathers all the political, law and cultural spheres). Thus, ideology permits the mode of production to reproduce itself. Furthermore, Marx and Engels are said to have believed,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx &amp; Friedrich Engels, "The German Ideology," from Selected Writings, pg 120&lt;/ref&gt; should a [[revolution]]ary force change the mode of production, the dominant class will immediately set out to create a new society to protect this new economic order. In the modernity of their era, Marx and Engels felt the [[ruling class|propertied class]] had essentially accomplished the establishment of a new societal and economic order, instinctively creating a society protective of their capitalist interests. They made this statement to the [[Bourgeoisie]] in the [[Communist Manifesto]]: "Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property, just as your [[jurisprudence]] is but the will of your class, made into law for all, a will whose essential character and direction are determined by the economic conditions of the existence of your class."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, ''Communist Manifesto'', pg 35&lt;/ref&gt; The [[young Marx]] hence criticized man's [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]], a concept which he later replaced by the critique of [[commodity fetishism]]. "Vulgar [[Marxism]]" has considered that the relation between the economical [[infrastructure]] and the ideological [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] was a [[unicausality|unicausal]] one, and thus believed in economic determinism. Engels said "The final causes of all social changes and [[political revolution]] are to be sought, not in men's brains, not in man's insight into internal truth and justice... but in the economies of each epoch."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Engels, ''Socialism -- Utopian and Scientific'', pg 54&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Engels advocated a revolution in economic structure as the only valid way of improving society and ending the oppression of the working class.

==Criticism==
Other Marxists and Marx-scholars—including [[György Lukács]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Maurice Godelier]], [[Franz Jakubowski]], [[Edward P. Thompson]] and [[Michael Lowy]]—completely reject the interpretation of Marx and Engels as "economic determinists". They claim this idea is based on a poor and selective reading of Marx and Engels' work.

They argue that this interpretation originated in the early years of the [[Second International]] and was popularised by [[Karl Kautsky]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], among many others. They refer to the disclaimers by Engels (see [[historical materialism]]) to the effect that while Marx and himself had focused a lot on the economic aspects, they were very aware that this did ''not'' in fact constitute the totality of society or of social life. However, some have viewed such comments as Engels's attempt to extricate himself from an untenable position: [[Max Weber]] and other influential sociological and economic thinker agreed that Marx's views were really unidimensional in regard to economic determinism. They did not agree that economic determinism was a vulgar interpretation of Marx. They regarded this to be the explicitly stated and true interpretation of Marx (See own admission in Friedrich Engels, ''Socialism—Utopian and Scientific'', pg 54). They criticized the simplicity in Marx's arguments and held that ideas and cultural beliefs and values determine societal progress and the evolution of society. (See [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|Weber's ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'']] (1905)).

Non-Marxist scholars have also objected that economic determinism is overly generalized, insofar as any serious historical explanation of ''economic'' realities must always refer to ''non-economic'' realities. This became obvious when one had to specify exactly of what the economic determinism precisely consisted. In addition, a lot of confusion about "economic determinism" is due to the conflation of the "commercial" with the "economic". For Marx at least, these were very ''different'' concepts.

The dynamic of history according to Marx was shaped precisely by the clash of those interests ([[class struggle]]), and that clash ''could not be understood'' simply in terms of economic self-interest, because it also involved human needs, customs, traditions, morals and values encompassing a whole way of life. On the other hand, Lenin wrote that "an idea that captures the minds of the masses becomes a material force," meaning that the said needs, customs, traditions, morals and values can be equated to economic forces.

The end result of economic determinism in this view is both [[economism]] (a narrow focus on how people earn their livelihood) and economic [[reductionism]] (the attempt to reduce a complex social reality to one factor—the economic—such that this one factor ''causes'' all other aspects of society).

==Notable economic determinists==

American geostrategist [[Thomas P. M. Barnett]] describes himself as an economic determinist in his book ''The Pentagon's New Map''.

There are two main approaches currently used to analyze archaeological remains from an evolutionary perspective: '''evolutionary archaeology''' and behavioral (or evolutionary) ecology. The former assumes that cultural change observed in the archaeological record can be best explained by the direct action of natural selection and other Darwinian processes on heritable variation in artifacts and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, J.L &amp; Smith, E.E. (1998). Is It Evolution Yet? A Critique of Evolutionary Archaeology.  Current Anthropology, Vol. 39, No. S1. Special Issue: The Neanderthal Problem and the  Evolution of Human Behavior (June 1998), pp. S141-S174. The University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter assumes that cultural and behavioral change results from phenotypic adaptations to varying social and ecological environments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Boone, J.L &amp; Smith, E.E. (1998). Is It Evolution Yet? A Critique of Evolutionary Archaeology. ''Current Anthropology'', Vol. 39, No. S1.

== History of Evolutionary Theory in Archaeology ==

=== Evolutionary archaeology in the 19th century ===
Over the past decades the term ‘evolution’ has undertaken several definitions and implications.&amp;nbsp; However, when referring to “human history and the development of long term trends it is used interchangeably with social or [[Sociocultural evolution|sociocultura]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l evolution”.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Stephen S.(2008).Evolution in Archaeology. ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', Vol. 37 , pp. 75-91.
&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The publication of Charles Darwin's On the [[On the Origin of Species|Origin of Species]] profoundly influenced the biological and social sciences. However, 19th century evolutionary archaeologists were influenced by the unilineal evolutionary schemes of Herbert Spencer and others. Herbert Spencer embraced a teleological notion where evolution was seen as having an ultimate and definite goal. Spencerian theory incorporated a progressive, unilineal explanation of cultural evolution in which human societies were seen as progressing through a fixed set of stages, from “savagery” through “barbarism” to “civilization”.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Tehrani, J. J. &amp; Collard, M. (2002) Investigating cultural evolution through biological phylogenetic analyses of Turkmen textiles. ''Journal of Anthropological Archaeology'' 21:443– 63&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for much of the 19th century evolutionary theory in archaeology was centered around explaining cultural traits and human history and account for the significant differences between cultural groups and their current state of living. Initially it focused on human transitions from foragers to horticulturalist, to implementation of agriculture, and eventually rise of civilizations.&amp;nbsp; Even into the early 20th century, evolutionary archaeologists, or cultural evolutionists, maintained a thoroughly non-Darwinian notion of evolution”.&lt;ref&gt;Bettinger, Robert I.(1991)''Hunter-gatherers: Archaeological and evolutionary requires a different kind of metaphysic from other ‘‘hard’’ theory.'' New York and London: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolutionary archaeology in the early-to-mid 20th century ===
"The social and political implications of early cultural evolutionary thinking, such as eugenics and other atrocities, understandably promoted a reaction, and the social sciences turned towards a thoroughly anti-biological stance: The Standard Social Science Model.&lt;ref&gt;Barkow, J. H., Cosmides, L. &amp; Tooby, J., eds. (1992) T''he adapted mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a strong resistance among social scientists rose arguing for limited biological restraints on human behavior. This reaction led to the acceptance of social influences and culture affecting and changing human behavior. The Standard Social Science Model, assumes that “culture is selected by free agents making active, unconstrained choices, and there has been a tendency to stress the vast plethora of different cultural practices rather than to look for cultural universals” (Workman and Reader, 2004)'''.''' &amp;nbsp;

The acceptance of the Standard Social Science Model and rejection of explanatory evolutionary theories in anthropology, resulted in Darwinian theory not being applied by anthropologist and archaeologist. As Dunnell (1980) surmises, “In the 1950s due to the influence of [[Boasian anthropology|Boasian]] school of thought, a dissatisfaction with the supposed Marxist connotations of evolution, and failure to accommodate a complex archaeological record, evolutionary theory was no longer a prevalent method used to explain archaeological phenomena”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Dunnell,R.C (1980) Evolutionary Theory and Archaeology.''Advances in Archaeological Method and Theory'', Vol. 3 , pp. 35-99.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, [[Binford &amp; Mort|Binford]] introduced a new explanatory framework in archaeology known as “[[Processual archaeology|New Archaeology”]] or “[[Processual archaeology|Processual Archaeology]]”.&amp;nbsp; This framework incorporated an evolutionary foundation, which was previously omitted in archaeology. This was a crucial step in archaeology since it acknowledged the need for a scientific explanation in the archaeological record and not just descriptive accounts. &amp;nbsp;Dunnell (1980)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; claims that even though the New Archaeology program insists on incorporating a scientific method, remnants of the early 1900s notion of evolution still remained, therefore ‘evolution’ as it is used in the hard sciences, has yet to be utilized with the same rigidity in the social sciences, specifically in archaeology &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (Dunnell,1980).

=== Neo-Darwinian Theory in Archaeology ===
The modern evolutionary synthesis, also called neo-Darwinian theory, was developed in the 1930s and 1940s. In the 1970s and 1980s, with the groundbreaking works of E.O. Wilson. Hamilton and R. Dawkins, a shift occurred from social-cultural explanation of human behavior to the return of biological, reductionist explanations based on neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Richerson, P. J. &amp; Boyd, R. (2005) ''Not by genes alone: How culture transformed human'' e''volution.'' University of Chicago Press.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes called the [[sociobiology]] approach. It provided a rich theoretical groundwork for analyzing culture in terms of modern evolutionary theory, but also developed “rigorous mathematical treatments of cultural change inspired by population genetic models”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With the works of Cavalli Sforza and Feldman&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Cavalli-Sforza, L. L. &amp; Feldman, M. W. (1981) Cultural transmission and evolution. Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and Boyd and Richerson,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Boyd, R. &amp; Richerson, P. J. (1985) ''Culture and the evolutionary process''. University of Chicago 
Press.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/ref&gt;  evolutionary archaeology become a more utilized approach.

Over the last three decades, two main evolutionary frameworks emerged in archaeology: Evolutionary Archaeology (EA) and Evolutionary Ecology (EE). The former draws on analogies with genetic and biological evolution in that it focuses on variation in cultural traits and attempts to reconstruct their phylogenetic histories. The latter views variation in artifacts as reflecting adaptive human behavior.

== Evolutionary Archaeology ==

=== Cultural Traits ===
EA focuses on cultural "traits" (or memes) and conceives of them as analogies to genes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; That is, cultural traits and genes both have the three characteristics necessary for natural selection (variation, selection, and inheritance) as well as non-selective processes, such as drift.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Defining the terms "culture" and "cultural traits" are key to effective EA research.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Mesoudi, A., Whiten, A. &amp; Dunbar, R. (2006) Towards a unified science of cultural evolution. ''Behaviroal and Brain Sciences'' 29, 329 –383.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; Richerson and Boyd&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (2005), define culture as “information capable of affecting individual’s behavior that they acquire from other members of their species through teaching, imitation, and other forms of social transmission”. “Information” is employed as a broad term incorporating ideas, knowledge, beliefs, values, skills, and attitudes&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; (Mesoudi, 2006).&lt;nowiki/&gt;

Variation, selection, and inheritance are necessary for changes of material remains (cultural traits) observed in the archaeological record.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Mesoudi, A. &amp; Whiten, A. (2004) The hierarchical transformation of event knowledge in human cultural transmission. ''Journal of Cognition and Culture'' 4:1– 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; These traits can go extinct as a result of competition, change in function or become vestigial, and adapt to their environment, as demonstrated by the work of human behavioral ecologists&lt;ref&gt;Smith, E. A. &amp; Winterhalder, B., eds. (1992) ''Evolutionary ecology and human behavior''. Aldinede Gruyter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; (Smith &amp; Winterhalder 1992).&amp;nbsp; They can be identified as analogous traits of exhibit the process of [[convergent evolution]]. Geographical distribution of cultural traits can vary through diffusion and can be explained by an evolutionary framework. Mesoudi et al. (2004), argues that Darwinian theory became successful without the knowledge of Mendelian inheritance, therefore cultural evolution does not have to rely on memes or “or particulate cultural transmission, a topical issue but one of great contention”.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Evolutionary Archaeology is based on the notion that claims culture exhibits key Darwinian evolutionary properties.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, on this basis, EA should follow the same, methods, and approaches that are used to study biological evolution and by doing so it can productively be applied to the study of human culture. By incorporating a comparison with the biological sciences, EA claims that the analysis of cultural will have scientific merit and lead to more progressive theoretical framework, that has yet to be employed in the analysis of cultural and social anthropology (archaeology as well)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Boone &amp; Smith 1998). &amp;nbsp;EA emphasizes the role of natural selection in affecting human behavior and do not consider the need to understand changing cultural traditions as part of their framework&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; (Shennan 2008).

Evolutionary archaeologist claim EA is not employing scientific metaphors from biology to explain archaeological process, but instead these evolutionary outlooks can elucidate the effect “on the questions asked, the taxonomies employed, and the role of archaeology as a discipline in a wider scientific and public landscape”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; (Mesoudi 2006). &amp;nbsp;Runciman (2005) claims that the goal of archaeologists working within an evolutionary paradigm is to explain how and why particular cultural traits become more common than others over time.&lt;ref&gt;Runciman, W. G. (2005) Culture does evolve. ''History and Theory'' 44:1 – 13.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;

Shennan (2004b) states that even though archaeologist seek to understand human history and prehistory, the theoretical framework and methods should not be limited to teleological explanations of ‘progress’, but archaeologist should play to their strengths, “which undoubtedly lie in the characterization of long-term patterning in past societies”.

Overall as summarized by Mesoudi (2006) it is necessary to understand individual choices and historical events because they are parts of evolutionary history. Especially since humans, unlike other species, are continuously generating and altering the social and physical environments to which they have to adapt.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;

===Phylogenetics===

According to Mesoudi (2006) it is necessary to treat cultural traits as analogous to biological characters. By using this analogy, it allows anthropologist and archaeologist, to apply strict phylogenetic methods to cultural data, no differently than evolutionary biologist &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;(Mesoudi, 2006). The logic behind this approach is that like biologist, anthropologist share the same fundamental goals. The first goal is to reconstruct the historical timeline of a specific trait, and the second goal is to distinguish and identify patterns of change&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;(Mesoudi,2006).

Mesoudi states that there have been several anthropological and archaeological studies utilizing this approach (phylogenetics) and have been deemed successful by “determining whether a group of traits are related by descent, whether their spread was associated with other traits, or whether they generated selection for other traits”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; (2006).

Specifically, this phylogenetic approach is crucial for archaeologist who are seeking to employ evolutionary paradigm in their research. Just as [[Paleobiology|paleobiologis]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t, archaeologist seek to answer similar research questions and tasks.&amp;nbsp; In sum, their goals are “identifying prehistoric artifacts, reconstructing lineages of these artifacts and of the people associated with them, and revealing the evolutionary relationships between these lineages&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;” (Mesoudi, 2006). Even the means of gathering date are similar if not the same. Both paleobiologist/paleontologist and archaeologist engage in excavations to retrieve information about the past specimens. Evolutionary archaeologist, thus have occupied the similar tools and methodological trajectory as paleobiologist. For example, O’Brien &amp; Lyman (2000) use evolutionary “population thinking” explanatory frameworks,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;O’Brien, M. J. &amp; Lyman, R. L. (2000) ''Applying evolutionary archaeology'': A systematic approach. Kluwer Academic/Plenum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; while Mace &amp; Holden (2005) use [[cladistics]]&lt;ref&gt;Mace, R. &amp; Holden, C. J. (2005) A phylogenetic approach to cultural evolution. ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 20:116 – 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and Neiman (1995) and uses models of selection or drift.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Neiman, F. D. (1995) Stylistic variation in evolutionary perspective: Inferences from decorative diversity and inter assemblage distance in Illinois woodland ceramic assemblages.''American Antiquity'' 60:7 – 36.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Mesoudi (2006) positions, that only in recent development have archaeologist started utilizing these phylogenetic approached in analyzing material remains and human history.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Seriation and Cladistics===

Seriation has not always been excluded from archaeological methods, according to Mesoudi (2006), “early archaeologists used the method of seriation to identify lineages of coins&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J. (1850) On the date of British coins. ''The Numismatic Chronicle and Journal of the Numismatic Society'' 12:127 – 37.&lt;/ref&gt; (Evans 1850), stone tools&lt;ref&gt;Pitt-Rivers, L.-G. A. L. (1875) On the evolution of culture''. Journal of the Anthropological Institute'' 4:293– 308.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; (PittRivers 1875), and Egyptian pottery &lt;ref&gt;Petrie, W. M. F. (1899) Sequences in prehistoric remains. ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'' 29:295– 301.&lt;/ref&gt;(Petrie 1899)”.&amp;nbsp; However, this approach was no longer employed by archaeologist&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; in the 20th century because of a rise in essentialist approach to archaeology, where cultural trait change occurs when one type transforms into another&lt;ref&gt;(2003) Cultural traits: Units of analysis in early twentieth-century anthropology. ''Journal of Anthropological Research'' 59:225 – 50&lt;/ref&gt; (Lyman and O’Brien,2003).This again, is drastically different from the methods evolutionary archeologist employ. They view which recognizes naturally occurring variation within populations rather than focusing on typological descriptions (Mesoudi, 2006).

Applying phylogenetic theory in archaeology and paleobiology takes on a fundamental assumption. This is that similar traits that vary through time are “causally connected by inheritance” which O’Brien &amp; Lyman (2000) term the assumption of “heritable continuity”.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;These evolutionary lineages according to Simpson (1961) serve as a means to define a species.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, G. G.(1961) ''Principles of animal taxonomy''. Columbia University Press.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Hull (1982) has argued for the idea of lineage based species to serve as an explanatory framework for culture.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Hull, D. L. (1982) The naked meme. ''In: Learning, development and culture: Essays in evolutionary epistemology'', ed. H. C. Plotkin, pp. 273 – 327. John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;O’Brien and Lyman (2000) are some of the first archaeologist to systematically employ this phylogenetic approach to material remains, specifically, have expanded the theory to explain prehistoric artifacts.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They argue that by employing seriation methods to the archaeological record they can reconstruct the evolutionary lineages of artifacts&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; (O’Brien and Lyman 2000).&amp;nbsp; This is accomplished by collecting an assemblage of material remains of a specific cultural trait, such a projectile point, and then artifacts are ordered by similarity.&amp;nbsp; Essentially the more in common two artifacts are, the closer together placed on a phylogenetic diagram, the less they have in common, the further apart they are placed&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; (Mesoudi, 2006). Seriation represents an evolutionary lineage connected by cultural transmission when artifacts show gradual, and coincidental change.

O’Brien and Lyman (2000) are major proponents for reintroducing seriation into archaeology.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They believe using this approach they can study evolutionary change in artifacts. One main example is their research based on the analysis of Southwestern United States projectile points.&amp;nbsp; By employing these phylogenic and specifically seriation methods they “show continuous, and gradually changing variation rather than a small number of distinct types” &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;(Mesoudi, 2006). They are practitioners of this approach because they argue that this method does not “force artifacts into distinct categories and distorts their true phylogenetic relationships”&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; (O’Brien and Lyman 2000). O’Brien and Lyman (2003) state that employing cladistics methods is also necessary if one is trying to explain the archaeological record accurately.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;O’Brien, M. J. &amp; Lyman, R. L.(2003) ''Cladistics and archaeology''. University of Utah Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They have conducted successful research “using a phylogenetic analysis of 621 Paleo-Indian projectile points from the Southeastern United States&lt;ref&gt;O’Brien, M. J., Darwent, J. &amp; Lyman, R. L. (2001) Cladistics is useful for reconstructing archaeological phylogenies:Palaeoindian points from the southeastern United States. ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' 28:1115–36.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; and Tehrani and Collard (2002) used similar methods to reconstruct the history of Turkmen textile pattern&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;”.

However, they acknowledge the application of phylogenetics in archaeology is no different than in paleobiology therefore one can expect similar problems to arise, such as distinguishing between homologies and analogies.

===Neutral Drift Model===

Another approach in evolutionary archaeology is the adaptation of neutral drift models from evolutionary biology (example,Crow &amp; Kimura (1970)&lt;ref&gt;Crow, J. F. &amp; Kimura, M. (1970) ''An introduction to population genetics theory''. Harper &amp; Row.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; to account for “stylistic variation” in artifacts&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; (Mesoudi, 2006). Neiman (1995), used a model that incorporated the selectively neutral but opposing forces of drift and innovation to show changes in ornamental styles of Illinois Woodland ceramic,&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; while Bentley and Shennan (2003) “found that the frequencies of West German pottery decorations over the course of 400 years can be predicted by a similar model of unbiased cultural transmission, with some anti-conformist bias in later period”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, R. A. &amp; Shennan, S. J. (2003) Cultural transmission and stochastic network growth. ''American Antiquity'' 68:459 – 85.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===

The main criticism of the EA is that one cannot use biological terminology and simply apply it to other disciplines, such as anthropology and specifically archaeology.&amp;nbsp; In other words, critics claim that there is no value of this approach and words such as ‘variation’, ‘selection’ and ‘drift’ are merely metaphorical. They state no scientific methods exist that can justify employing the theory of evolution that exists in biology and paleobiology to what is observed in the social world. Another criticism is that human culture is increasingly complex and variable thus it can’t be constrained to the same theoretical notions such evolutionary biology. In addition, critics such as, Bloch 2000;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Bloch, M. (2000) A well-disposed social anthropologist’s problems with memes. In: ''Darwinizing culture'', ed. R. Aunger, pp. 189 – 204. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinker 1997&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S. (1997) ''How the mind works''. W. W. Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; blatantly reject any evolutionary analysis of culture. The use of phylogenetics and cladistics also is an issue because it is quite difficult to account for distinct “characters” in cultural artifacts, as O’Brien &amp; Lyman (2003) state.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The counterargument is that just as biologist struggled with this notion, it did not prevent them from “producing valuable work using the character concept” (Wagner 2000).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Ultimately, biological and cultural change share many similarities, yet the two frameworks are still not identical, therefore researcher must be advised that these biological models “cannot and should not be unthinkingly applied to cultural phenomena without careful consideration of any potential differences” &lt;ref&gt;Plotkin, H. C.&amp;nbsp;(2002b) ''The imagined world made real''. Penguin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;(Plotkin 2002b).&amp;nbsp;

== Evolutionary Ecology ==
Evolutionary Ecology also employs Darwinian properties; however [[natural selection]] is involved in the development of the cognitive process that led humans to be able to make fitness enhancing decisions. Archaeologist who utilized EE, use adaptive design as a starting point to create and test models by incorporating optimization goals, currencies and constraints&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Boone &amp; Smith 1998). EE emphasizes the importance of understanding changing cultural traditions&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; (Shennan 2008).&amp;nbsp;

According to Boone and Smith (1998) EE applies phenotypic variation in a more accurate approach.&amp;nbsp; They claim that humans have been designed by the processes of selection to make adaptive changes to their [[phenotype]]s. This phenotypic variation results from “genetically and/or culturally evolved mechanisms and variable conditions&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Boone and Smith, 1998).&amp;nbsp; Therefore, they claim that the only role natural selection plays in and EE framework is in the development of the cognitive process that allow humans to make adaptive decisions, and respond to variable environments.&amp;nbsp; They also, mention that environment is one of the driven factors in prompting variation among humans. In other words, humans have “problem-solving abilities at various levels such as physiological, morphological, behavioral and scales”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Boone and Smith, 1998). This is based on a notion referred to as [[phenotypic plasticity]], essentially phenotypes under the EE approach can respond to varying environmental conditions. What is important to gather is,that by applying an EE analysis to anthropological and archaeological phenomena, it allows researchers to employ phenotypic plasticity to the explanations of human behavior. By doing so, this explanatory framework gives humans the cognitive abilities to “adapt to change quicker that they could through natural selection acting on genetic variation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;” (Boone and Smith, 1998)

Evolutionary ecology assumes that “behavioral variation itself is not the direct product of natural selection, rather, selection enters the explanation only indirectly, as the process that designed the behaving organism (or in fact its ancestors) to respond facultatively and adaptively to particular environmental conditions&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;” (Boone and Smith, 1998).

The '''Indonesian ceremonial bronze axes''' were [[Bronze Age]] objects that were produced in the [[Nusantara|Indonesian archipelago]] between the 1st and 2nd century AD. Archaeological sites in [[Java]], [[Bali]], [[Sulawesi]], the eastern islands, and around [[Lake Sentani]] in [[Papua (province)|Papua]] have been uncovered, showing the bronze axes at the center of a bronze production or at burial sites. They are a testimony of the extensive trade network in the islands of the archipelago in the first millennium AD, thought to be connected to the [[Dong Son culture]].  

==Archaeology== 
[[File:MET 29G A29AR4.jpg|thumb|left|Blade-shaped bronze axe contains delicate pattern and are too weak to be used as weapon or agricultural tools, which indicates their ceremonial use.]]
The first record of metalwork in the Indonesian archipelago was around 500 BC. Most of the earliest bronze objects were probably used for ceremonies e.g. highly-stylized axes and [[kettledrum]]s. Findings of bronze objects from this period are numerous in Indonesia. Even people in the eastern side of Indonesia, that had not shown any signs of contact with Hinduism coming from the Indian subcontinent, had developed sophisticated metal-working techniques. Bronze must have been imported into these islands, because many small-sized islands e.g. [[Bali]] or [[Rote Island|Rote]], did not mine copper nor tin, the raw materials for bronze-making, and yet bronze artifacts were found to be produced extensively in these islands.{{sfn|Miksic|2001|p=33}} 

Ceremonial bronze axes continued to be developed during the pre-Classic era from the 1st to 2nd century AD. During this period, bronze-casting industries flourished, especially in [[Java]] and [[Bali]]. These industries were probably instrumental in the manufacture of various kinds of bronze objects in Indonesia, including the ceremonial bronze axes. Various types of bronze axes were discovered across Indonesia e.g. numerous swallow-tail socketed bronze axes found in Java, the large axe with anthropomorphic carving e.g. those found in [[Rote Island]] and [[Makassar]], and the curved bronze blade found in many sizes including miniatures.{{sfn|Bellwood|2001|p=39}} These archaeological findings of bronze objects production center and various sites indicating their use in a ceremony indicate a thriving inter-island trade in the [[Nusantara|Indonesian archipelago]] in the first millennium AD.{{sfn|Bellwood|2001|p=38}} 

==Form==
There are various forms of ceremonial bronze axes found in Indonesia. The similarities between these bronze axes are their artistic delicate patterns and their delicate fragile design which indicate their ceremonial use. A bronze ceremonial axe discovered in Landu on North [[Rote Island|Rote]] in 1875, contains anthropomorphic designs decorated with geometric patterns e.g. concentric circles, fish-bone pattern, and spirals, is very similar with the early art of the southwest Pacific; but with additional geometric motifs also found in bronze objects coming from mainland Asia, e.g. striated pattern.{{sfn|Heekeren|2013|p=11}} This is very similar with those discovered in Sulawesi, such as the Makassar Axe which was kept in the [[National Museum of Indonesia]].{{sfn|Bellwood|2001|p=38}}

This type of enormous bronze axes was produced using [[lost-wax casting]] in two parts which was then combined in the middle. The final object contains a hollow. This well-decorated bronze axe was without a doubt ceremonial in use, but the exact nature of the use is unknown. Being hollow (because the two parts were combined into one), it may have been used as a water vessel, or hanged as percussive instrument, or simply acted as heirloom objects as a symbol of status in important ceremonies.{{sfn|Heekeren|2013|p=10}}

Swallow-tail socketed bronze axes were found in Java. An exceptionally large axe discovered in [[Bogor]] have its swallowtail part adorned on one of its surface by a roughly drawn mask with bud-shaped eyes.

Other types of Indonesian ceremonial bronze axe is the curved blade which have been discovered everywhere in the archipelago from [[West Java]] (e.g. at [[Bandung]]) to [[Sulawesi]]. The blade-shaped bronze axe were produced in full size and as miniatures. Although looks like a weapon, its elegant blade is not strong enough for any practical use in both warfare or agriculture.{{sfn|I Wayan Ardika|2001|p=41}}

Illustration of these axes carried by plumed warriors appears on various bronze objects across the archipelago and northern Vietnam, the origin of the [[Dong Son drum]].

'''Isaac Deutscher''' (3 April 1907 – 19 August 1967) was a Polish writer, journalist and political activist who moved to the United Kingdom at the outbreak of [[World War II]]. He is best known as a biographer of [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] and as a commentator on Soviet affairs. His three-volume biography of Trotsky, in particular, was highly influential among the British [[New Left]].&lt;ref&gt;Neil Davidson, [http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj104/davidson.htm "The prophet, his biographer and the watchtower"], International Socialism 104, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2017}}&lt;!--first two paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
Deutscher was born in [[Chrzanów]], a town in the [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] region of Poland, then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], into a family of religiously observant Jews. He studied with a [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] [[rebbe]] and was acclaimed as a prodigy in the study of the [[Torah]] and the [[Talmud]]. By the time of his [[bar mitzvah]], however, he had lost his faith. He "tested God" by eating non-[[kosher]] food at the grave of a [[tzadik]] (holy person) on [[Yom Kippur]]. When nothing happened, he became an atheist.

Deutscher first attracted notice as a poet, when at 16 he began publishing poems in Polish literary periodicals. His verse, in [[Yiddish]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], concerned Jewish and Polish [[mysticism]], history and mythology, and he attempted to bridge the gulf between Polish and Yiddish culture. He also translated poetry from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Latin]], German, and Yiddish into Polish.

Deutscher studied literature, history, and philosophy as an extramural student at the [[University of Kraków|Jagellonian University]] in [[Kraków]].&lt;ref name=TD68/&gt; At 18 he left Kraków for [[Warsaw]], where he studied philosophy and economics and became a [[Marxism|Marxist]]. Around 1927, he joined the illegal [[Communist Party of Poland]] (KPP) and became the editor of the party's underground press.&lt;ref name=TD68/&gt; In 1931, he toured the [[Soviet Union]], seeing the economic conditions under the first Five Year Plan. Here [[Moscow University]] and [[Minsk University]] offered him posts as a professor of the history of socialism and of Marxist theory. He declined these offers and returned to his underground work in Poland.&lt;ref name=TD68/&gt; On his return, Deutscher co-founded the first anti-Stalinist group in the Polish Communist Party, protesting the party line that Nazism and Social Democracy were "not antipodes but twins."&lt;ref name=TD68/&gt; This contradicted the then [[Third Period|official Communist line]], which saw [[social democrat]]s as "[[social fascists]]", the greatest enemies of the Communist Party. Deutscher published an article called "The Danger of Barbarism over Europe", in which he urged the formation of a [[united front|united socialist-Communist front]] against [[Nazism]]. Deutscher was expelled from the party for "exaggerat[ing] the danger of Nazism and ... spreading panic in the Communist ranks."&lt;ref name=TD68&gt;Tamara Deutscher (1968), [http://www.deutscherprize.org.uk/Isaac%20&amp;%20Tamara%20Deutscher.htm "Isaac Deutscher 1907 – 1967"], Preface to ''The Non-Jewish Jew &amp; Other Essays''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to Britain and journalism (1939–47)==
In April 1939, Deutscher left Poland for London as a correspondent for a Polish-Jewish newspaper for which he had worked as a proof reader for fourteen years.&lt;ref name=TD68/&gt; This move saved his life and paved the way for his future career. He never returned to Poland and never saw any of his family again. He became a British subject in 1949, taking his oath of allegiance on 12 May 1949.&lt;ref&gt;London Gazette 21 June 1949 https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/38647/page/3062&lt;/ref&gt;

In London, Deutscher worked as a correspondent for the Polish newspaper, and for a while he joined the [[Trotskyist]] [[Revolutionary Workers League (Britain)|Revolutionary Workers League]].

When [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] occupied Poland in September 1939, and his connection with his newspaper was severed, he taught himself English and began writing for English magazines.&lt;ref name=TD68/&gt; He was soon a regular correspondent for the leading weekly ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;ref name=TD68/&gt; In 1940, he joined the Polish Army in Scotland, but was interned as a dangerous subversive.&lt;ref name=TD68/&gt; Released in 1942, he joined the staff of ''The Economist'' and became its expert on Soviet affairs and military issues, and its chief European correspondent.&lt;ref name=TD68/&gt; He also wrote for ''[[The Observer]]'' as a roving European correspondent under the pen-name "Peregrine".&lt;ref name=TD68/&gt;

He left journalism in 1946–47 to write books.&lt;ref name=TD68/&gt; Deutscher's name (with the remark "Sympathiser only") subsequently appeared on [[Orwell's list]], a list of people (many writers and journalists) which [[George Orwell]] prepared in March 1949 for the [[Information Research Department]], a propaganda unit set up at the Foreign Office by the Labour government. Orwell considered the listed people to have pro-communist leanings and therefore to be inappropriate to write for the IRD.&lt;ref name="The New York Review of Books"&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16550 "Orwell's List" by Timothy Garton Ash.] ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' Volume 50, Number 14. 25 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographer and academic (1948–1967)==
Deutscher published his first major work, ''Stalin, A Political Biography'' in 1949. Deutscher was still a committed Trotskyist, but in the book Deutscher gave Stalin what he saw as his due for building a form of socialism in the Soviet Union, even if it was, in Deutscher's view, a perversion of the vision of [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The Stalin biography made Deutscher a leading authority on Soviet affairs and the [[Russian Revolution]]. He followed it up with his most ambitious work, a three-volume biography of Trotsky: ''The Prophet Armed'' (1954), ''The Prophet Unarmed'' (1959) and ''The Prophet Outcast'' (1963). These books were based on detailed research into the Trotsky Archives at [[Harvard University]]. Much of the material contained in the third volume was previously unknown, since Trotsky's widow, [[Natalia Sedova]], gave him access to the closed section of the Archives. British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] declared in 2006 that the trilogy "made a very deep impression on me and gave me a love of political biography for the rest of my life."&lt;ref&gt;Cahal Milmo, ''[[The Independent]]'', 3 March 2006, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/blair-reveals-an-unexpected-influence-trotsky-468385.html "Blair reveals an unexpected influence: Trotsky"]&lt;/ref&gt; Deutscher planned to conclude his series with a study of Lenin, but ''Life of Lenin'' remained incomplete at the time of his death, partly due to a politically motivated denial of a university position to Deutscher.&lt;ref&gt;M Ignatieff, ''Isaiah Berlin: A Life'' (London, 1998), pp 93, 235; cited in Neil Davidson, [http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj104/davidson.htm "The prophet, his biographer and the watchtower"], International Socialism 104, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; As later revealed, when he was asked to evaluate the academic credentials of Deutscher, [[Isaiah Berlin]] argued against such a promotion, because of the profoundly pro-communist militancy of the candidate.&lt;ref&gt;For this incident, see David Caute, ''Isaac &amp; Isaiah: The Covert Punishment of a Cold War Heretic'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the upsurge of left-wing sentiment that accompanied the [[Vietnam War]] made Deutscher a popular figure on university campuses in both Britain and the United States. His Trotskyism had by then become a form of [[Marxist humanism]], although he never renounced Trotsky. In 1965, he took part in the first "Teach-In" on Vietnam at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where thousands of students listened to his indictment of the Cold War.&lt;ref name=TD68/&gt; He was [[George Macaulay Trevelyan|G. M. Trevelyan]] Lecturer at [[Cambridge University]] for 1966–67,&lt;ref name=TD68/&gt; and also lectured for six weeks at the [[State University of New York]].&lt;ref name=TD68/&gt; In spring 1967, he guest lectured at [[New York University]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], Harvard and [[Columbia University|Columbia]].&lt;ref name=TD68/&gt; The G. M. Trevelyan Lectures, under the title ''The Unfinished Revolution'', were published after his sudden and unexpected death in Rome in 1967, where he went for an Italian TV broadcast, a play about the fall of Trotsky written and directed by [[Marco Leto]], starring [[Franco Parenti]] as Trotsky and [[Renzo Giovampietro]] as Stalin. A memorial prize honouring him, called the [[Deutscher Memorial Prize]], is awarded annually to a book "which exemplifies the best and most innovative new writing in or about the Marxist tradition". Isaac Deutscher made the distinction between classical Marxism and vulgar Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marxists.org/archive/deutscher/1965/marxism.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==In relation to Judaism and Zionism==
Despite being an [[Atheism|atheist]], Deutscher emphasised the importance of his Jewish heritage. He coined the expression "[[Cultural Judaism|non-Jewish Jew]]" to apply to himself and other [[Jewish humanism|Jewish humanists]]. Deutscher admired [[Elisha ben Abuyah]], a Jewish heretic of the 2nd century CE.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} But he had little time for specifically Jewish politics. In Warsaw, he joined the Communist Party, not the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Jewish Bund]], whose "[[Yiddishism|Yiddishist]]" views he opposed.

His definition of his Jewishness was: "[[Religion]]? I am an atheist. [[Zionism|Jewish nationalism]]? I am an [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]]. In neither sense am I therefore a Jew. I am, however, a Jew by force of my unconditional solidarity with the persecuted and exterminated. I am a Jew because I feel the pulse of [[Jewish history]]; because I should like to do all I can to assure the real, not spurious, security and self-respect of the [[Jews]]."&lt;ref&gt;Deutscher, Isaac. "Who is a Jew?" In ''The Non-Jewish Jew and Other Essays''. Tamara Deutscher, ed. and Introduction. New York: Oxford University Press, 1968. P. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[World War II]], Deutscher opposed [[Zionism]] as economically retrograde and harmful to the cause of international socialism, but in the aftermath of [[the Holocaust]] he regretted his pre-war views, and argued a case for establishing [[Israel]] as a "historic necessity" to provide a home for the surviving Jews of Europe. In the 1960s, he became more critical of Israel for its failure to recognise the dispossession of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]], and after the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 he demanded that Israel withdraw from the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]]. "This 'six-day wonder'", he commented, "this latest, all-too-easy triumph of Israeli arms will be seen one day... to have been a disaster... for Israel itself."&lt;ref&gt;Deutscher, Isaac. An Interview: On the Israeli-Arab War. New Left Review I/44 (July–August 1967): 30–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

His most famous statement regarding Israel is "A man once jumped from the top floor of a burning house in which many members of his family had already perished. He managed to save his life; but as he was falling he hit a person standing down below and broke that person’s legs and arms. The jumping man had no choice; yet to the man with the broken limbs he was the cause of his misfortune. If both behaved rationally, they would not become enemies. The man who escaped from the blazing house, having recovered, would have tried to help and console the other sufferer; and the latter might have realized that he was the victim of circumstances over which neither of them had control. But look what happens when these people behave irrationally. The injured man blames the other for his misery and swears to make him pay for it. The other, afraid of the crippled man’s revenge, insults him, kicks him, and beats him up whenever they meet. The kicked man again swears revenge and is again punched and punished. The bitter enmity, so fortuitous at first, hardens and comes to overshadow the whole existence of both men and to poison their minds."&lt;ref&gt;Deutscher, Isaac. ''The Non-Jewish Jew and Other Essays''. London: Oxford University Press, pp 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Israeli Arab War, June 1967" (1967), Deutscher wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Still we must exercise our judgment and must not allow it to be clouded by emotions and memories, however deep or haunting. We should not allow even invocations of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] to blackmail us into supporting the wrong cause.” (Quoted in ''Prophets Outcast'', Nation Books, 2004, p. 184)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He believed,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"To justify or condone Israel’s wars against the [[Arabs]] is to render Israel a very bad service indeed and to harm its own long-term interest. Israel’s security, let me repeat, was not enhanced by the wars of 1956 and 1967; it was undermined and compromised by them. The ‘friends of Israel’ have in fact abetted Israel in a ruinous course.” (Quoted in ''Prophets Outcast'', Nation Books, 2004, p. 184)

}}'''Jacques Joseph Champollion-Figeac''' (5 October 1778 – 9 May 1867) was a [[France|French]] [[archaeologist]], elder brother of [[Jean-François Champollion]] (decipherer of the [[Rosetta Stone]]).

==Biography==
He was born at [[Figeac]] in the ''[[Départements of France|département]]'' of [[Lot (département)|Lot]]. He became professor of [[Greek language|Greek]] and librarian at [[Grenoble]]. His research in Grenoble in 1803 revealed the existence of a [[Merovingian]] crypt under the [[Grenoble Archaeological Museum|church of St. Laurent]]. He was compelled to retire in 1816 on account of the part he had taken during the [[Hundred Days]]. He afterwards became keeper of manuscripts at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] in [[Paris]], and professor of [[palaeography]] at the [[École des Chartes]]. In 1850 he became librarian of the [[Château de Fontainebleau]].

He was a correspondent, living abroad, of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences|Royal Institute of the Netherlands]] from 1832 to 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00004583 |title=J.J. Champollion (1778 - 1867) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He edited several of his brother's works, and was also author of original works on [[philological]] and historical subjects, among which may be mentioned:
* ''Antiquités de Grenoble'' (1807)
* ''Nouvelles recherches sur les patois ou idiomes vulgaires de la France'' (1809)
* ''Nouveaux éclaireissements sur la ville de Cataro, aujourd'hui Grenoble'' (1814)
* ''Annales de Lagides'' (1819; supplement, 1821)
* ''Chartes latines sur papyrus du VIe siècle de l'ère chrétienne''.
* ''L'Egypt ancienne et moderne'' (1840) Based on his brother's manuscript collections.
* ''L'écriture démotique égyptienne (1843) Based on his brother's manuscript collections.
* ''Traité élémentaire d'archeologie'' (2d ed. 1843)
* ''Histoire des peuples anciens et modernes, l'Asie centrale, l'Inde et la Chine'' (1857)
* ''Monographie du palais de Fontainebleau'' (1859–64)
* ''Documents paléographiques relatifs à l'histoire des beaux-arts et des belles-lettres pendant le moyen âge'' (1868)

==Son==
His son [[Aimé-Louis Champollion-Figeac|Aimé-Louis]] (1812-1894) became his father's assistant at the Bibliothèque Nationale, and besides a number of works on historical subjects wrote a biographical and bibliographical study of his family in ''Les Deux Champollion'' (Grenoble, 1887).

==In popular culture==
Champollion was portrayed by [[Stuart Bunce]] in the 2005 [[BBC]] docudrama ''[[Egypt (TV series)|Egypt]]''.

'''Johannes Willem "Johan" Schot''' (born 4 February 1961) is a Dutch historian working in the field of science and technology policy. A historian of technology and an expert in sustainability transitions, Johan is Director of the [[Science Policy Research Unit |Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU)]] at the University of Sussex. He was elected to the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (KNAW) in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/8250 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214094708/https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/8250 |title=Johan Schot |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |archive-date=14 February 2016 |accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
After his studies at Erasmus University Rotterdam, Schot became a consultant in 1985 at the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]] Centre for Technology and Policy Studies. He completed his Phd at the [[University of Twente]] in 1991 on the 'Societal Shaping of Technical Change: Constructive Technology Assessment as a form of ''Luddism''' and then he served as an Assistant Professor, then Associate Professor at Twente until 1999. He was made part-time Professor in the Social History of Technology at the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] in 1998 and subsequently at Twente in 1999. In 2002 the [[Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]] awarded him a research grant under the Innovational Research Incentives scheme for talented scholars (highest category) to establish his own research program. In 2003 he was appointed full-time Professor in the History of Technology/Transitions Studies at the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]]. From September 2010 until July 2011 he worked as a fellow at the [[Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study|Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities and Social Sciences]] in Wassenaar, writing and editing a six-volume book series. The book series entitled [http://www.makingeurope.eu/www/bookseries Making Europe: Technology and Transformation 1850-2000], was published by [[Palgrave Macmillan]] in 2013. In January 2014, Johan Schot was appointed Director of the [[Science Policy Research Unit]] at the [[University of Sussex]]. A year later he won the 2015 [[Leonardo da Vinci Medal]] of the [[Society for the History of Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyoftechnology.org/awards/davinci.html The Leonardo da Vinci Medal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718021120/http://www.historyoftechnology.org/awards/davinci.html |date=2011-07-18 }}, [[Society for the History of Technology]]. Accessed November 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; for his outstanding contribution to the history of technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/spru/newsandevents/2015h/awards/historyoftech Johan Schot receives award for outstanding contribution to history of technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Schot's current research focuses on the conceptualisation and historical interpretation of Deep Transitions. Such transitions refer to long term change processes which transform the economy and society. The First Deep Transition started in 1750 and resulted in the [[welfare state]]. The Second Deep Transition started somewhere in the 1970s and is transforming capitalism and modernity as we know it. Building upon the insights of [[Christopher Freeman]] and [[Carlota Perez]], the aim is to develop a new version of the Multi-level Perspective (MLP) of Sustainability Transitions that is able to capture the nature and dynamics of Deep Transitions. Professor Schot will also use this new theory to generate insights for the [[Transition management (governance)|governance of new transition pathways]].

In this research, Professor Schot builds upon his ability to draw insights from the history of technology, evolutionary economics, as well as science and technology studies. In the past, he was instrumental in developing and extending the niche theory of radical change into the influential MLP on sustainability transitions, working with [[Arie Rip]], Frank Geels and others. He was also key in establishing a new framework for research and policy around sustainable technologies, called Strategic Niche Management, building on his earlier influential work on the Constructive Technology Assessment framework. In addition, Professor Schot has co-developed a range of new concepts for the contextual history of technology, such as the mediation junction, the innovation junction, technocratic internationalism, and the hidden integration and fragmentation of Europe.

Johan Schot's work has greatly benefited from an emphasis on creative collaborations across borders and disciplines which open up innovative new research agendas. He has created and pioneered large scale collaborations, in which many (up to 100 or more) scholars and practitioners from business, government and societal groups work productively together. Initiatives such as the [http://www.greeningofindustry.org/ Greening of Industry Network] and the influential Dutch [http://www.ksinetwork.nl/home Knowledge Network for System Innovations and Transitions] have all successfully enabled the development of innovative new insights and transformative practices. More recently, the [http://www.tensionsofeurope.eu/ Tensions of Europe] collaboration of up to 300 scholars resulted in the dynamic ‘[http://www.inventingeurope.eu/ Inventing Europe]’ digital history project, delivered in partnership with ten cultural heritage institutions and museums. This transnational collaboration also led to a unique book series, called ‘[http://www.makingeurope.eu/www/bookseries Making Europe]’, which provides new interpretations of [[European History]] through the lens of technology.

== Books ==
=== Making Europe ===

Edited by Johan Schot and Philip Scranton of [[Rutgers University]] (USA), the Making Europe  book series investigates the question of ‘Who built Europe?’ by charting the people and ideas, goods and technologies that spread between countries— and between continents. It is the result of a collective effort of an international team of authors and researchers, initiated in 1999 by researchers from [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] and the Dutch Foundation for the History of Technology. Fifteen years later the initiative is supported by an international group of renowned universities, research institutes, museums of science and technology, business and industry, and public organizations.

In 2014, the series was awarded the prestigious Freeman Award by the [http://easst.net/ European Association for the Study of Science and Technology] (EASST).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/spru/newsandevents/2014h/awards/freemanprize SPRU director wins Freeman Prize for 'Making Europe']&lt;/ref&gt; The Freeman Award is given in recognition of a publication, which reflects a significant collective contribution to the interaction of science and technology studies with the study of innovation. The prize is awarded by EASST in honour of Chris Freeman, founder of [[SPRU]].

=== Technology and the Making of the Netherlands ===

This book, which synthesizes findings originally presented in a series of seven volumes published in the Netherlands, uses the idea of contested modernization as an overarching concept through which to understand Dutch technological history. The modernizers of Dutch society—including engineers, management consultants, architects, and others—did not always agree on how to modernize; moreover, the unruliness of specific practices often derailed or redirected implementation. Tensions between top-down and bottom-up modernization, and between scale-enlargement and more flexible arrangements of mutual coordination and cooperation shaped Dutch history. The chapters examine such topics as attempts to create an industrial nation, new infrastructures; the coming of mass production and the emergence of a consumer society; and land-use planning in a low-lying country.

'''Jovan Ristić''', or '''Ristitch''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Јован Ристић) (January 16, 1831 – September 4, 1899) was a [[Serbia]]n statesman, diplomat and historian. 
==Biography==
Born at [[Kragujevac]], he was educated at [[Belgrade]], [[Heidelberg]], [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]]. After failing to obtain a professorship at [[Belgrade Higher School|Belgrade's Grandes écoles]], he was appointed in 1861 Serbian diplomatic agent at [[Constantinople]]. On his return from Constantinople, his brilliant intellectual qualities attracted the attention of the government.  He soon became known as the most competent of the government officials. He was immediately offered a ministerial post by [[Mihailo Obrenović III|Prince Mihailo]], who described him as his "right arm", but declined office, being opposed to the reactionary methods adopted by the prince's government. He had already become the recognized leader of the [[Liberal Party (Kingdom of Serbia)|Liberal Party]]. As a politician, he saw all the dangers that would have to be faced should Serbia embark on a policy of land redemption. The Turkish army, always a formidable fighting force, would overwhelm the Serbs, if it could be wholly massed against them. A Serbian invasion of the rebellious provinces would also, if successful, mean a conflict with Austria-Hungary, in which Russia would probably not interfere, while France was then in no condition to support other nations' plights for freedom. Ristić's reputation was enhanced by the series of negotiations which ended in the peaceful withdrawal of the [[Turkey|Turkish]] troops from the Serbian fortresses in 1867. After the assassination of Prince Mihailo in 1868, he was nominated member of the council of regency, and on the 2nd of January 1869 the third Serbian constitution, which was mainly his creation, was promulgated. {{sfn|Bourchier|1911}} When the regency came to an end, and [[Milan Obrenović IV|Prince MIlan]] attained his majority in 1872, Ristić became foreign minister; a few months later he was appointed prime minister, but resigned in the following autumn (1873). Later, [[Old Serbia]] broke into rebellion, and this was followed by a similar movement in [[Bulgaria]]. Ristić again became prime minister in April 1876, and was faced with a dilemma. If Serbia could only act quickly and establish herself in [[Bosnia]]-[[Herzegovina]] and Old Serbia, it would take time to dislodge her, and meanwhile the example of insurrection would probably spread far and wide over the whole of Turkey in Europe. Also Ristić, [[Stevča Mihailović]], [[Ilija Garašanin]], [[Nikola Hristić]], Miloje Lješanin, [[Ljubomir Kaljević]], [[Milivoje Petrović Blaznavac]], [[Jovan Marinović]], [[Milan Piroćanac]], [[Sava Grujić]], and other distinguished Serbian statesmen have been taught by long experience that with the Powers nothing succeeds like self-help. Possession is nine points of the law. Ristić was able to deduct, if Serbia could maintain a position, however precarious, in the ''unredeemed'' Serbian lands, the Serbs could look forward with confidence to being ultimately supported by Russia. Ristić therefore decided to act, and all Serbia was behind him. In that way he gained an international reputation as foreign minister on two important occasions (while prosecuting two wars against Turkey: July 1876; and March 1877 and December 1877; March 1878) by promoting an expansionist policy that he hoped would make Serbia the nucleus for a strong South Slav state. {{sfn|Bourchier|1911}} There were times when things looked dim. While Bulgaria was to obtain frontiers far beyond her wildest dreams, Serbia was to obtain little more than the merest rectification. 

At the [[Congress of Berlin]] Ristić labored with some success to obtain greater advantages for Serbia than had been accorded to her by the [[Treaty of San Stefano]]. His personal secretary at the congress was poet and attorney [[Laza Kostić]]. The provisions of the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]] provided Serbia with no more than {{convert|3860|sqmi|km2}} of new territory and a proclamation of complete independence from Turkey. This, however, disappointed the Serbians, owing to the obstacles now raised to the realization of the national program. The Ristić government became unpopular. He was forced to resign when he refused to sign a trade agreement with [[Austria-Hungary]] that he believed would make Serbia economically dependent on that country. {{sfn|Bourchier|1911}}

In 1887 King Milan I (who had assumed the royal title in 1882), alarmed at the threatening attitude of the Radical party, recalled Ristić to power at the head of a coalition cabinet; a new constitution was granted in 1889, and later that year the king abdicated in favor of his son, [[Aleksandar Obrenović|Prince Alexander]]. Ristić now became head of a council of regency, entrusted with power during the minority of the young king, and a Radical ministry was formed. {{sfn|Bourchier|1911}}

In 1892, however, Ristić transferred the government to the Liberal party, with which he had always been connected. This step and the subsequent conduct of the Liberal politicians caused serious discontent in the country. On the 1st (13th) of April 1893 King Alexander, by a successful stratagem, imprisoned the regents and ministers in the palace, and, declaring himself of age, recalled the Radicals to office. {{sfn|Bourchier|1911}}

Ristić now retired into private life. He died in Belgrade on September 4, 1899. Though cautious and deliberate by temperament, he was a man of strong will and firm character.

'''Jón Jónsson Aðils''' (25 April 1869, [[Reykjavík]] - 5 July 1920) was an Icelandic historian. He's been described as "Iceland's most prolific historian of the early twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halink|first=Simon|date=2017-01-01|title=Noble heathens: Jón Jónsson Aðils and the problem of Iceland's pagan past|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nana.12319/abstract|journal=Nations and Nationalism|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/nana.12319|issn=1469-8129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians and political scientists argue that Aðils strongly shaped Icelandic nationalist discourse, and that his influence still affects Icelandic discourse on sovereignty issues, such as [[Accession of Iceland to the European Union|European integration]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sjálfstæð þjóð: trylltur skríll og landráðalýður|last=Bergmann|first=Eiríkur|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tandfebooks.com/isbn/9780203487570|title=Iceland and European Integration|work=Taylor &amp; Francis eBooks|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Middel|first=Kim|date=2018|title=Íslenzkt þjóðerni: Jón Jónsson Aðils’ Iceland and the road to the future|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/ejss.2018.48.issue-2/ejss-2018-0013/ejss-2018-0013.xml|journal=European Journal of Scandinavian Studies|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1515/ejss-2018-0013|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Middel|first=Kim Peronne|title=The search for self-awareness: The road to national identity on Iceland, sæc. xiii-xx|date=2018|publisher=University of Groningen|url=https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/publications/the-search-for-selfawareness(3a1681b2-4d94-441d-a4d4-9828df91a694).html|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography ==
He is known for distinguishing periods in [[History of Iceland|Icelandic history]] into golden ages, periods of decline and periods of humiliation. In Aðils’s narrative, the golden age begins with settlement in 874 (and reaches its high point during the Saga Age) and ends when Iceland falls under foreign rule (Jónsson 1903, 79, 88-89, 103, 105, 178).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://landogsaga.is/section.php?id=7775&amp;id_art=8179|title=Land og saga - Íslenzkt þjóðerni. Eftir Jón J. Aðils|website=landogsaga.is|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under foreign rule, the Icelandic nation declined and ultimately suffered humiliation (Jónsson 1903, 241-242).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergmann|first=Eiríkur|date=2014-03-01|title=Iceland: A postimperial sovereignty project|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0010836713514152|journal=Cooperation and Conflict|language=en|volume=49|issue=1|pages=33–54|doi=10.1177/0010836713514152|issn=0010-8367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aðils' lessons were that under Icelandic rule, the nation was prosperous, productive and artistic, but suffered under foreign role. However, Aðils argued that within every Icelander, a desire for freedom and nationalism remained, and only had to be awoken.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Historian Guðmundur Hálfdanarson suggests that Aðils himself was doing his best to awaken this slumbering nationalist sentiment and strengthen the Icelandic pursuit of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hálfdanarson|first=|year=2010|title=Sagan og sjálfsmynd(ir) íslenskrar þjóðar|url=|journal=Glíman|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
{{lang|es|'''Limpieza de sangre'''}} ({{IPA-es|limˈpjeθa ðe ˈsaŋɡɾe|lang}}), {{lang|pt|'''limpeza de sangue'''}} ({{IPA-pt|lĩˈpezɐ ðɨ ˈsɐ̃ɡɨ|lang}}, {{IPA-gl|limˈpeθa ðe ˈsaŋɡe|lang}}) or {{lang|ca|'''neteja de sang'''}} ({{IPA-ca|nəˈtɛʒə ðə ˈsaŋ|lang}}), literally "cleanliness of blood" and meaning "blood purity", played an important role in the [[modern history]] of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

It referred to those who were considered pure "[[Old Christian]]s", without recent [[Muslim]] or [[Jews|Jewish]] ancestors, or within the context of the empire ([[New Spain]] and [[Portuguese India]]) usually to those without ancestry from the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]], Aboriginal Asian, or Aboriginal African people.

== After the Reconquista ==
By the end of the [[Reconquista]] and the conversion or expulsion of Muslim [[mudéjar]]s and [[Sephardi Jews]], the populations of [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] were all nominally Christian. Out of Spain's population of 7 million, this included up to a million recent converts from Islam and 200,000 converts from Judaism, who were collectively referred to as "[[New Christian]]s". Converts from Judaism were referred to as [[converso]]s or more pejoratively [[marrano]]s, and converts from Islam were known as [[Morisco]]s. A commonly leveled accusation was that the New Christians were false converts, secretly practicing their former religion as [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jews]] or [[Crypto-Islam|Crypto-Muslims]]. Nevertheless, the concept of purity of blood came to be more focused on ancestry than of personal religion. The first statute of purity of blood appeared in [[Toledo, Spain]], 1449,&lt;ref name="Chami"&gt;[http://pachami.com/Inquisicion/LimpiezaSangre.html Estatutos de Limpieza de Sangre], Pablo A. Chami.&lt;/ref&gt; where an anti-converso riot succeeded in obtaining a ban on conversos and their descendants from most official positions. Initially, these statutes were condemned by the monarchy and the Church; however, in 1496, [[Pope Alexander VI]] approved a purity statute for the [[Hieronymites]].&lt;ref name="Chami"/&gt;

This stratification meant that the Old Christian [[commoner]]s could assert a right to [[honor]] even if they were not in the [[nobility]]. The religious and [[Military order (monastic society)|military order]]s, [[guild]]s and other organizations incorporated in their [[by-law]]s clauses demanding proof of cleanliness of blood. Upwardly mobile New Christian families had to either contend with their plight, or bribe and falsify documents attesting generations of good Christian ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Elena Martínrez, ''Genealogical Fictions: Limpieza de sangre, religion, and gender in colonial Mexico''. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim to universal ''[[hidalgo (nobility)|hidalguía]]'' (lowest nobility) of the [[Basques]] was justified by intellectuals like Manuel Larramendi (1690–1766)&lt;ref name="Larramendi"&gt;[[Manuel de Larramendi]], ''Corografía de la muy noble y muy leal provincia de Guipúzcoa'', Bilbao, 1986, facsimile edition of that from Editorial [[Ekin]], Buenos Aires, 1950. (Also published by Tellechea Idígoras, San Sebastián, 1969.) Quoted in ''[http://www.uv.es/rseapv/Anales/97_98/A_117_139_La_idea_de_Espanya.pdf La idea de España entre los vascos de la Edad Moderna]'', by Jon Arrieta Alberdi, ''Anales 1997-1998'', Real Sociedad Económica Valenciana de Amigos del País.&lt;/ref&gt; because the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] had not reached the Basque territories, so it was believed that Basques had maintained their original purity, while the rest of Spain was suspect of [[miscegenation]]. The universal hidalguía of Basques helped many of them to positions of power in the administration.&lt;ref name="Auñamendi"&gt;[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/100471 Limpieza de sangre] in the Spanish-language [[Auñamendi Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was reinforced by the fact that, as a result of the Reconquista, a large number of Spanish noble lineages were already of Basque origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aranzadi, Juan|title=Milenarismo vasco: Edad de Oro, etnia y nativismo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9C_ZQawvZkC&amp;pg=PT508|date=7 March 2012|publisher=Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial España|isbn=978-84-306-1581-0|pages=508–509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tests of ''limpieza de sangre'' had begun to lose their utility by the 19th century; rarely did persons have to endure the grueling inquisitions into distant parentage through birth records. However, laws requiring ''limpieza de sangre'' were still sometimes adopted even into the 19th century. For example, an edict of 8 March 1804 by King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] resolved that no knight of the military orders could wed without having a council vouch for the ''limpieza de sangre'' of his spouse.&lt;ref&gt;Codigos Españoles Tome X. Page 225&lt;/ref&gt;

Official suppression of such entry requirements for the Army was enacted into law on 16 May 1865,&lt;ref&gt;''Colección Legislativa de España'' (1870), p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; and extended to naval appointments on 31 August of the same year. On 5 November 1865, a decree allowed children born out of wedlock, for whom ancestry could not be verified, to be able to enter into religious higher education (canons).&lt;ref&gt;''Colección Legislativa de España'' (1870), page 365&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October 1866, the test of blood purity was outlawed for the purposes of determining who could be admitted to college education. On 20 March 1870, a decree suppressed all use of blood purity standards in determining eligibility for any government position or any licensed profession.&lt;ref&gt;''Colección Legislativa de España'' (1870), page 366&lt;/ref&gt;

The discrimination was still present into the 20th century in some places like Majorca. No [[Xueta]] (descendants of the Majorcan conversos) priests were allowed to say Mass in a cathedral until the 1960s.&lt;ref name="JPerez"&gt;''Los judíos en España'', [[Joseph Pérez]]. Marcial Pons. Madrid (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedure to judge purity of blood===
The earliest known case judging ''Limpieza de Sangre'' comes from the Church of Cordoba, that explained the procedure to judge the purity of blood of a candidate as follows: Kneeling, with his right hand placed over the image of a crucifix on a Bible, the candidate confirmed themselves as not being of either Jewish or Moorish extraction. Then the candidate provided the names of their parents and grandparents, as well as places of birth. Two delegates of the council, church or other public place would then research the information to make sure it was truthful. If the investigation had to be carried out of Cordoba, a person, not necessarily a member of the council, would be appointed to examine the witnesses appointed by the candidate.

The concept of ''limpieza de sangre'', was a significant barrier for many Spaniards to emigrate to the Americas, since some form of proof of not having recent Moorish or Jewish ancestors was required to emigrate to the [[Spanish Empire]]. However, within Spain's overseas territories the concept evolved to be linked with racial purity for both Spaniards and indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Elena Martinez, ''Genealogical Fictions: Limpieza de Sangre, Religion, and Gender in Colonial Mexico.'' Stanford: Stanford University Press 2008, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Proofs of racial purity were required in a variety of circumstances in both Spain and its overseas territories. Candidates for office and their spouses had to obtain a certificate of purity that proved that they had no Jewish or Muslim ancestors and in New Spain, proof of whiteness and absence of any in the lineage who engaged in work with their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, ''Genealogical Fictions'', p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, as early as the sixteenth century, shortly after the Spanish colonization of America was initiated, several regulations were enacted in the [[Laws of the Indies]] to prevent Jews and Muslims and their descendants to emigrate and settle in the overseas colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Elena Martínez, "Limpieza de Sangre" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 1, p. 751. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a thriving business in creating false documentation to allow conversos to emigrate to Spain's overseas territories.&lt;ref&gt;Alicia Gojman de Backal, "Conversos" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, vol. 1, p.341.&lt;/ref&gt; These provisions banning emigration are repeatedly stressed upon on following editions of the Laws, which provides an indication that the regulations were often ignored,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Encyclopedia of the Jewish diaspora: origins, experiences, and culture | publisher=ABC-CLIO | author=Avrum Ehrlich, Mark | year=2009 | page=689 | isbn=1-85109-873-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; most likely because colonial authorities at the time looked the other way, as the skills of those immigrants were badly needed.  During the period when Portugal and Spain were ruled by the [[Iberian Union|same monarch]] (1580-1640), Portuguese merchants, many of whom were so-called [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] (Jews passing as Christians) became important members of the merchant communities in the viceregal capitals of Mexico City and Lima.  When Portugal successfully revolted in 1640 from Spain, the Holy Office of the [[Inquisition]] in both capitals initiated intensive investigations to identify and prosecute crypto-Jews, resulting in spectacular autos de fe in the mid seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan I. Israel, ''Race, Class, and Politics in Colonial Mexico, 1610-1670.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press 1975, p. 245-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Confederate statue, Statesboro, GA, US.jpg|thumb|right|Statue in Statesboro, Georgia]]

This is a '''list of Confederate monuments and memorials''' that were established as public displays and symbols of the [[Confederate States of America]] (CSA), Confederate leaders, or Confederate soldiers of the [[American Civil War]]. Part of the [[commemoration of the American Civil War]], these symbols include monuments and statues, flags, [[Memorial Day#In the South|holidays]] and other observances, and the names of schools, roads, parks, bridges, counties, cities, lakes, dams, military bases, and other public works.&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/20160421/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy|title=Whose heritage?

[[Monument]]s and [[memorial]]s are listed below alphabetically by state, and by city within each state. States not listed have no known qualifying items for the list. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www-m.cnn.com/2018/06/05/us/confederate-monuments-texas-trnd/index.html|title=The state leading the way in removing Confederate monuments?

For monuments and memorials which have been removed, consult [[Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials]].

This list does not include the removal of figures connected with the [[origins of the Civil War]] or [[white supremacy]], but not with the Confederacy, including statues of Supreme Court Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] in Annapolis, Baltimore, and Frederick, Maryland, a controversial portrait of North Carolina Chief Justice [[Thomas Ruffin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

It also does not include post-Civil War [[white supremacist]]s, such as North Carolina Governor [[Charles Aycock]], some of whose monuments are also being removed (see [[Charles Brantley Aycock#Legacy]]).

==History==
===Monument building and dedications===
[[File:Confedarate monuments (2).png|thumb|300px|Chart of public symbols of the Confederacy and its leaders as surveyed by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), by year of establishment. Most of these were put up either during the [[Jim Crow]] era or during the [[Civil Rights Movement]], times of increased racial tension.&lt;ref name="SPLC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CoxAnalysis" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|This chart is based on data from an SPLC survey which identified "1,503 publicly sponsored symbols honoring Confederate leaders, soldiers or the Confederate States of America in general." The survey excluded "nearly 2,600 markers, battlefields, museums, cemeteries and other places or symbols that SPLC deemed largely historical in nature"&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;}}]]
Memorials have been erected on public spaces (including on courthouse grounds) either at public expense or funded by private organizations and donors. Numerous private memorials have also been erected.

According to [[Smithsonian Magazine]], "Confederate monuments aren't just heirlooms, the artifacts of a bygone era. Instead, American taxpayers are still heavily investing in these tributes today. We have found that, over the past ten years [2008–2018], taxpayers have directed at least $40 million to Confederate monuments—statues, homes, parks, museums, libraries and cemeteries—and to Confederate heritage organizations."&lt;ref name=Smithson/&gt;

====Early memorializations====
A small number of memorializations were made during the war, mainly as ship and place names. After the war, [[Robert E. Lee]] said on several occasions that he was opposed to any monuments, as they would, in his opinion, "keep open the sores of war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Va}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2018}} Many more monuments were dedicated in the years after 1890, when [[United States Congress|Congress]] established the first [[National Military Park]] at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park|Chickamauga and Chattanooga]], and by the turn of the twentieth century, five battlefields from the Civil War had been preserved: Chickamauga-Chattanooga,
[[Antietam National Battlefield|Antietam]], [[Gettysburg National Military Park|Gettysburg]], [[Shiloh National Military Park|Shiloh]], and [[Vicksburg National Military Park|Vicksburg]]. At Vicksburg National Military Park, more than 95 percent of the park's monuments were erected in the first eighteen years after the park was established in 1899.&lt;ref name=Vicksburg&gt;{{cite web|title=

====Jim Crow and white supremacy====
Confederate monument-building has often been part of widespread campaigns to promote and justify [[Jim Crow]] laws in the South, and assert [[white supremacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leib|first=Jonathan I.|last2=Webster|first2=Gerald R.|last3=Webster|first3=Roberta H.|date=2000-12-01|title=Rebel with a cause?

According to the AHA, memorials to the Confederacy erected during this period "were intended, in part, to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], and to intimidate African Americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life." A later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement, and according to the AHA "these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes."&lt;ref&gt;American Historical Association, [https://www.historians.org/news-and-advocacy/statements-and-resolutions-of-support-and-protest/aha-statement-on-confederate-monuments AHA Statement on Confederate Monuments] (August 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Smithsonian Magazine]], "far from simply being markers of historic events and people, as proponents argue, these memorials were created and funded by Jim Crow governments to pay homage to a slave-owning society and to serve as blunt assertions of dominance over African-Americans."&lt;ref name=Smithson&gt;{{cite article

According to historian Jane Dailey from the [[University of Chicago]], in many cases, the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a "white supremacist future".&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544266880/confederate-statues-were-built-to-further-a-white-supremacist-future|title=Confederate Statues Were Built To Further A 'White Supremacist Future'|website=npr.org|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another historian, Karen Cox, from the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]], has written that the monuments are "a legacy of the brutally racist Jim Crow era", and that "the whole point of Confederate monuments is to celebrate white supremacy".&lt;ref name="CoxAnalysis" /&gt; Another historian from UNC, James Leloudis, stated that "The funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the Jim Crow era and the right of white men to rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com/news/local/counties/durham-county/article167619947.html|title=Durham Confederate statue: tribute to dying veterans or political tool of Jim Crow South?|website=heraldsun.com|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were erected without the consent or even input of Southern African-Americans, who remembered the Civil War far differently, and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved.&lt;ref name="SAHUpton"&gt;[http://www.sah.org/publications-and-research/sah-blog/sah-blog/2017/09/13/confederate-monuments-and-civic-values-in-the-wake-of-charlottesville Confederate Monuments and Civic Values in the Wake of Charlottesville].

Many Confederate monuments were dedicated in the former Confederate states and [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] in the decades following the Civil War, in many instances by [[Ladies Memorial Association]]s, [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] (UDC), [[United Confederate Veterans]] (UCV), [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] (SCV), the Heritage Preservation Association, and other memorial organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winsboro|first=Irvin D.S.|date=2016|title=The Confederate Monument Movement as a Policy Dilemma for Resource Managers of Parks, Cultural Sites, and Protected Places: Florida as a Case Study|url=http://www.georgewright.org/332winsboro.pdf|journal=The George Wright Forum|volume=33|pages=217–29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiggins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ForsythPark" /&gt; Other Confederate monuments are located on Civil War battlefields. Many Confederate monuments are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], either separately or as contributing objects within listings of courthouses or historic districts. Art historians Cynthia Mills and Pamela Simpson argued, in ''Monuments to the [[Lost Cause]]'', that the majority of Confederate monuments, of the type they define, were "commissioned by white women, in hope of preserving a positive vision of antebellum life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Monuments to the Los Cause: Women, Art, and the Landscapes of Southern Memory|last1=Mills|first1=Cynthia|last2=Simpson|first2=Pamela H.|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|year=2003|isbn=978-1572332720|page={{Page needed|date=October 2017}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gulley|first=H.E.|year=1993|title=Women and the Lost Cause: preserving a Confederate identity in the American Deep South|journal=Journal of Historical Geography|volume=19|issue=2|pages=125–41|doi=10.1006/jhge.1993.1009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth century, technological innovations in the granite and bronze industries helped reduce costs and made monuments more affordable for small towns. Companies looking to capitalize on this opportunity often sold nearly identical copies of monuments to both the North and South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/why-those-confederate-soldier-statues-look-a-lot-like-their-union-counterparts/2017/08/18/cefcc1bc-8394-11e7-ab27-1a21a8e006ab_story.html|title=Why those Confederate soldier statues look a lot like their Union counterparts|last=Fisher|first=Marc|date=2017-08-18|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-09-16|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|quote=Because of technological innovations in the granite and bronze industries, the price of these statues came way down}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scholarly study====
Scholarly studies of the monuments began in the 1980s. In 1983 John J. Winberry published a study which was based on data from the work of R.W. Widener.&lt;ref name="Widener"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Confederate monuments: Enduring symbols of the South and the War Between the States|last=Widener|first=Ralph W.|publisher=Andromeda Associates|year=1982|isbn=|location=|page=|oclc=8697924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He estimated that the main building period for monuments was from 1889 to 1929 and that of the monuments erected in courthouse squares over half were built between 1902 and 1912. He determined four main locations for monuments; battlefields, cemeteries, county courthouse grounds, and state capitol grounds. Over a third of the courthouse monuments were dedicated to the dead. The majority of the cemetery monuments in his study were built in the pre-1900 period, while most of the courthouse monuments were erected after 1900. Of the 666 monuments in his study 55% were of Confederate soldiers, while 28% were obelisks. Soldiers dominated courthouse grounds, while obelisks account for nearly half of cemetery monuments. The idea that the soldier statues always faced north was found to be untrue and that the soldiers usually faced the same direction as the courthouse. He noted that the monuments were "remarkably diverse" with "only a few instances of repetition of inscriptions".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

He categorized the monuments into four types. Type 1 was a Confederate soldier on a column with his weapon at parade rest, or weaponless and gazing into the distance. These accounted for approximately half the monuments studied. They are however the most popular among the courthouse monuments. Type 2 was a Confederate soldier on a column with rifle ready, or carrying a flag or bugle. Type 3 was an obelisk, often covered with drapery and bearing cannon balls or an urn. This type was 28% of the monuments studied, but 48% of the monuments in cemeteries and 18% of courthouse monuments. Type 4 was a miscellaneous group, including arches, standing stones, plaques, fountains, etc. These account for 17% of the monuments studied.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Over a third of the courthouse monuments were specifically dedicated to the Confederate dead. The first courthouse monument was erected in Bolivar, Tennessee, in 1867. By 1880 nine courthouse monuments had been erected. Winberry noted two centers of courthouse monuments; the Potomac counties of Virginia, from which the tradition spread to North Carolina, and a larger area covering Georgia, South Carolina and northern Florida. The diffusion of courthouse monuments was aided by organizations such as the United Confederate Veterans and their publications, though other factors may also have been effective.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Winberry listed four reasons for the shift from cemeteries to courthouses. First was the need to preserve the memory of the Confederate dead and also recognize the veterans who returned. Second was to celebrate the rebuilding of the south after the war. Third was the romanticizing of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]], and the fourth was to unify the white population in a common heritage against the interests of African American southerners. He concluded "No one of these four possible explanations for the Confederate monument is adequate or complete in itself. The monument is a symbol, but whether it was a memory of the past, a celebration of the present, or a portent of the future remains a difficult question to answer; monuments and symbols can be complicated and sometimes indecipherable."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|title='Lest We Forget': The Confederate Monument and the Southern Townscape|authors=John J.

==Geographic distribution==

Confederate monuments are widely distributed across the [[southern United States]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The distribution pattern follows the general political boundaries of the Confederacy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Of the more than 1503 public monuments and memorials to the Confederacy, more than 718 are monuments and statues. Nearly 300 monuments and statues are in Georgia, Virginia, or North Carolina. According to one researcher, "the absence of monuments in [[East Tennessee|eastern Tennessee]] and [[western North Carolina]] indicates those regions' Union sentiment, and the few monuments in Maryland, West Virginia, and Kentucky reflect those states' ambivalent war-time politics." The Northern States that remained part of the Union, as well as the Western States that were largely settled after the Civil War, have few or no memorials to the Confederacy.

* Women of the Confederacy Monument (1917), on south side of Capitol grounds. Cost was $20,000, sculpted by [[Belle Kinney Scholz|Belle Marshall Kinney]]. "The monument features two female figures and one male figure, a wounded and dying soldier. To the left of the soldier, a sympathetic woman is presenting a palm of glory to the soldier, a symbol of triumph even in death. Above both the soldier and the woman stands 'Fame'. She, in turn, is placing a wreath on the head of the woman in recognition of her contribution to the Confederate cause. Below the bronze figures are four inscriptions facing each direction, and dedicated to 'our' mothers, daughters, sisters and wives. On the southern face, which is the front of the monument, is a quote from Jefferson Davis which, among other virtues, praises the women 'whose pious ministrations to our wounded soldiers soothed the last hours of those who died far from the objects of their tenderest love.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Maurice Warwick Beresford''', MA, FBA, (6 February 1920 – 15 December 2005) was an English economic historian and medieval archaeologist.

==Academic career==
Born in [[Sutton Coldfield]], Beresford was educated at [[Bishop Vesey's Grammar School]] and [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] (MA). He was a [[conscientious objector]] in the [[Second World War]], doing [[social work]] in Birmingham and London.

Beresford became a Lecturer at the [[University of Leeds]] in 1948 and was appointed Professor of [[Economic History]] at [[University of Leeds|Leeds]] in 1959, a post he was to hold until his retirement in 1985 when he was given the title [[Emeritus]] Professor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reporter.leeds.ac.uk/538/s7.htm University of Leeds, Reporter 538, Biographical note]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beresford was elected Fellow of the [[British Academy]] (FBA) in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/dec.cfm?letter=B British Academy, List of deceased fellows] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506060305/http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/dec.cfm?letter=B |date=6 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research interests==
In 1945, while working as a warden at an adult education centre, Beresford discovered the remains of the abandoned village of [[Bittesby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/dec/22/guardianobituaries.obituaries |work=The Guardian | date=22 December 2005 | last=Dyer | first=Christopher | title=Maurice Beresford: A historian on the trail of England's lost villages (Obituary)}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Thus began a lifelong interest in the subject. Together with [[John Hurst (archaeologist)|John Hurst]] he conducted archaeological excavations at the deserted village of [[Wharram Percy]]. This work became an important impetus for [[medieval archaeology]] in Britain and Europe.

As an undergraduate, he wrote a paper on parkland in [[Sutton Coldfield]], the beginning of his interest in the interaction between the physical landscape and documents such as maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/newspaperRetrieve.do?sort=DateAscend&amp;docLevel=FASCIMILE&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;tabID=T003&amp;bookId=&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchId=R1&amp;currentPosition=2&amp;qrySerId=Locale%28en%2C%2C%29%3AFQE%3D%28ke%2CNone%2C17%29maurice+beresford%3AAnd%3ALQE%3D%28da%2CNone%2C12%29%3E+12%2F13%2F2005%24&amp;retrieveFormat=MULTIPAGE_DOCUMENT&amp;bucketSubId=&amp;inPS=true&amp;userGroupName=lancs&amp;hilite=y&amp;docPage=article&amp;nav=next&amp;docId=IF502595662&amp;searchTypeName=BasicSearchForm&amp;contentSet=LTO|title=Professor Maurice Beresford: Historian whose painstaking work on deserted medieval communities led to his celebrated book ''The Lost Villages of England'' (Obituary)|work=The Times |date=2 Jan 2006|page= 45|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interest led to his 1957 publication, ''History on the Ground''.

[[File:Moti Zakin.png|thumb|Dr. Mordechai (Moti) Zaken]]

'''Mordechai Zaken''' also '''Moti Zaken''' ({{lang-he|מוטי/מרדכי זקן}}; {{lang-ar|مردخاي زاكين }}), born 1958 in [[Jerusalem]], is an expert on the [[Kurds]] and [[Middle East]]ern [[minorities]], both by academic training – he is [[historian]] of the [[Jews]], the [[Kurds]] and the [[Assyrian Christians]] in [[Kurdistan]],&lt;ref&gt;His research was quoted and referred to by many scholars who deal with different subjects touched upon by Zaken. See for instance the following publications: Nader Entessar, Kurdish politics in the MIDDLE East, Lexington books, 2009:213; MICHAEL FISCBACH, Jewish PROPERTY CLAIMS AGAINST ARAB COUNTRIES, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY PRESSS, 2010: 215, 355; Oman Tax Guide, Lulu.com, 2015:79-80.&lt;/ref&gt; and by professional practice. He served as the Israeli [[Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] advisor on
[[Israeli Arabs]] and [[minorities]] during his first term (1997–1999), and has been serving as advisor in the [[Ministry of Public Security (Israel)|Ministry of Public Security]] from 2001.

==Education and Expertise==
He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] ([[Political Science]] and [[Middle Eastern]] and [[Islamic Studies]]), [[Master of Arts|MA]], [[Cum Laude]], and [[PhD]] (2003), in [[Middle Eastern]] and [[Islamic Studies]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He studied as well in the [[US]] in both SUNY [[Binghamton]] and [[New York University]] (1987-1990). Among his influential teachers were [[Moshe Sharon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asmeascholars.org/professor-moshe-sharon/|title=Professor Moshe Sharon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Z. Kedar]] and the late [[semitic languages|semitic]] [[linguist]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Gideon Goldenberg|he|3=גדעון גולדנברג}}, with whom he published [[the Book of Ruth]] in [[Neo-Aramaic]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Book of Ruth in Neo-Aramaic," [By] G. Goldenberg and M. Zaken, in W. Heinrichs (Ed.), Studies in Neo-Aramaic, Cambridge: [[Harvard]] Semitic Studies Series(1990): 151-157.&lt;/ref&gt; He published another [[Neo-Aramaic]] text in a book honoring Goldenberg's [[Diamond Jubilee|jubilee]].&lt;ref&gt;"Inventors’ Fate" A Folk-Tale in the [[Neo-Aramaic]] of [[Zakho]]," in M. Bar-Asher (ed.), Massorot: Studies in Language Traditions and Jewish Languages, vols. 9, 10, 11 (1997): 383-395 [Heb.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Oral History Documentation on the Jews of Kurdistan==
The severe dearth of written and archival sources on Kurdistan, drove Dr. Zaken at an early stage of his career to embark an [[fieldwork|oral history fieldwork]] research, conducting altogether hundreds of in-depth interviews with more than sixty elderly [[Jewish]] [[Kurds|Kurdish]] informants, thus saving their memories from being lost forever.&lt;ref&gt;The Jews of Kurdistan &amp; their Tribal Chieftains: A Study in Survival, by Mordechai (Moti) Zaken (Jerusalem, 2015), Rev. &amp; 2nd EBook edition; Jewish Subjects and their Tribal Chieftains in Kurdistan: A Study in Survival, in Jewish Identities in a Changing World, vol. 9 (Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2007; The book has recently published into Arabic by the Center for Academic Research in Beirut, 2013. Its importance may be viewed in the introductions of the editors of the book. The translator into Arabic Dr. Suad M. Khader explains:“This book is considered an important contribution to both the Kurdish and the Arabic library…the translation of this kind of book is considered an important necessity… the author introduced an important picture of this era of Kurdistan.”
Dr. Nasir al-Ka’bi, Director of the Center for Academic Research in Beirut wrote:
“The major innovation of this study is the use of the verbal narrative (oral history) as it was clear that the other traditional and archival sources were not sufficient…”This study is distinct from other studies of the Jews of the Orient, as it concentrates on the nature of the relations of the Jews with their vicinities, namely the aghas and the masters; their relations with the authorities, the rulers and the leaders of the towns, which permits the political dimension, and their relations with the Muslims, including the religious dimension…"His book on the Jews and the tribal Kurdish society has received wide attention and commended even in its Arabic translation, published in Beirut, as an "innovation."&lt;/ref&gt; This study forms a new set of historical records. His book on the Jews and the tribal Kurdish society has received wide attention and commended even in its Arabic translation, published in Beirut, as an "innovation,"&lt;ref&gt;...''the study is very detailed and provides much hitherto unknown information on Kurdish Jews and their relations with their Muslim neighbors...'' according to Rachel Simon of Princeton University, at the Association of Jewish Libraries Newsletter, May/June 2008, Volume XXVII, No. 4 [http://www.jewishlibraries.org/main/Portals/0/AJL_Assets/documents/Publications/newsletter/2008may.pdf (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewish-subjects-chieftains-kurdistan.blogspot.co.il/|title=Rev., 2nd.

Moti Zaken served as the last National Director of [[ISFI]], or "The Institute of Students and Faculty on Israel," in New York, an organization under the auspices of the Israeli [[Foreign Ministry]] and the [[Israeli Consulate]] in [[New York City]] (1989 -1991). [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/This is a flyer distributed by ISFI in universities during the late 1980s and early 1990s] [[ISFI]] provided political and cultural resources, ideas and tools, for Jewish and pro-Israel student activists throughout the US and Canada, through which Israeli oriented activities and the message of Israel could be promoted in US campuses.[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/This "ISRAEL ACTIVIST CALENDAR" was originated by ISFI leaders and activists to promote Israeli oriented activities in campuses and in communities in the US]

==Journalism, Media and Public Speaking==
In 1982, as Chief-Editor of the students' newspaper at the Hebrew University "[[Pi-Ha'aton]]" (Heb., פי האתון "The donkey's mouth," taken from [[the Book of Numbers]], 22:28), one of his main journalistic achievements was the unearthing of an old photograph from 1948, taken by Arabs and showing mutilated faces and bodies of Jewish soldiers that were part of an army unit that later became known as "[[Nabi Daniel Caravan; Heb., שיירת נבי דניאל."]] He published the photograph and the story behind its discovery in a special Independence Day Edition, on 26 April 1982. He was also the Co-Chief editor of "Tipul Shoresh" (Heb.,root canal treatment) an annual newspaper of the public activists' program at the Hebrew University, the circulation of which was stopped by the directors and university administration, due to its critical approach towards the university policy regarding social issues.&lt;ref&gt;https://arabjewsarchive.wordpress.com/category/%D7%98%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%A9/&lt;/ref&gt;As a scholar, Dr. Zaken has been a frequent guest in radio and TV programs, speaking mostly on the Kurds and the minorities in the Middle East, and has been interviewed by newspapers as an expert on these subjects.[http://www.gfbv.it/3dossier/isr-pal/isr-min.html an article in Germany about the minorities in Israel]]

The '''Moscow Art Theatre''' (or '''MAT'''; {{lang-ru|Московский Художественный академический театр (МХАТ)}}, ''Moskovskiy Hudojestvenny Akademicheskiy Teatr'' ('''МHАТ''')) is a theatre company in [[Moscow]]. It was founded in 1898 by the seminal [[Russia]]n [[theatre practitioner]] [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], together with the playwright and director [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]]. It was conceived as a venue for [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] theatre, in contrast to the [[melodrama]]s that were Russia's dominant form of theatre at the time. The theatre, the first to regularly put on shows implementing [[Stanislavski's system]], proved hugely influential in the acting world and in the development of modern American theatre and drama.

==Beginnings==
At the end of the 19th-century, Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko both wanted to reform Russian theatre to high-quality art that was available to the general public. They set about creating a private theatre over which they had total control (as opposed to trying to reform the government operated [[Maly Theatre (Moscow)|Maly Theatre]], a move which would have given them far less artistic freedom). On 22 June 1897, the two men met for the first time at the Slavyanski Bazar for a lunch that started at 2 PM and did not end until 8 AM the next morning.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; While Stanislavski’s approach to theatre revolved around the acting process, Nemirovich was far more concerned with the literary, intellectual angle.

Their differences proved to be complementary, and they agreed to initially divide power over the theatre, with Nemirovich in charge of the literary decisions and Stanislavski in charge of all production decisions. Stanislavski interviewed all his actors, making sure they were hard working and devoted as well as talented. He made them live together in common housing for months at a time to foster community and trust, which he believed would raise the quality of their performances. Stanislavski's system, in which he trained actors via the acting studios he founded as part of the theatre, became central to every production the theatre put on.&lt;ref&gt;Gauss (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The system played a huge influence in the development of [[method acting]].

Stanislavski and Danchenko’s initial goal of having an “open theatre,” one that anyone could afford to attend, was quickly destroyed when they could neither obtain adequate funding from private investors, nor from the Moscow City Council.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Theatre's first season included works by [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy|Aleksey Tolstoy]] (''[[Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich]]''), [[Henrik Ibsen]], and [[William Shakespeare]], but it wasn’t until it staged [[Anton Chekhov]]'s four major works, beginning with [[Moscow Art Theatre production of The Seagull|its production of ''The Seagull'' in 1898]], with Stanislavski in the role of Trigorin, that the theatre achieved fame. This production was so successful that the theatre adopted the [[seagull]] as its [[emblem]].

After Chekhov’s death in 1904, the theatre experienced a huge changeover; Chekhov had envisioned fellow playwright and friend [[Maxim Gorki]] as his successor as the Theatre’s leading dramatist, but Nemirovich and Stanislavski’s reaction to his play ''[[Summerfolk]]'' was unenthusiastic, causing Gorki to leave. He took with him [[Savva Morozov]], one of the theatre’s main investors at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Now in dire straits, the theatre decided to accept invitations to go on an international tour in 1906, which started in Berlin and included Dresden, Frankfurt, Prague, and Vienna. The tour was a huge success, gaining the theatre international acclaim. However, the sudden change in fortune did not completely quell the company's internal strife; Stanislavski appointed friends to the theatre’s management without consulting Nemirovich and opened studios attached to the theatre where he began to implement his acting system, cementing Nemirovich’s fears that the theatre was becoming a mere extension of Stanislavski’s own ideas and work. The tension between the two led Stanislavski to abandon his duties as a board member and to relinquish all his power over policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre continued to thrive after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 and was one of the foremost state-supported theatres of the [[Soviet Union]], with an extensive repertoire of leading Russian and Western playwrights. Although several revolutionary groups saw it as an irrelevant marker of pre-revolutionary culture, the theatre was initially granted support by [[Vladimir Lenin]], a frequent patron of the Art Theatre himself. [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] wrote several plays for the MAT and satirised the organisation mercilessly in his ''[[Theatrical Novel]]''. [[Isaac Babel]]'s ''[[Sunset (play)|Sunset]]'' was also performed there during the 1920s. A significant number of Moscow Art Theatre's actors were awarded the prestigious title of [[People's Artist of the USSR]]. Many actors became nationally known and admired thanks to their film roles. However, the Civil War saw many of the theatre’s actors being cut off from Moscow, and the support it received from the government diminished under Lenin’s [[New Economic Policy]]. The subsidies it had come to rely on were withdrawn and the theatre was forced to survive on its own profits. By 1923, the MAT was in $25,000 debt.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The theatre experienced further blows through the end of the 1930s. Stanislavski's heart attack onstage during a production of ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' in 1928 led to his almost complete withdrawal from the theatre, while the Stalinist climate began to suppress artistic expression and controlled more and more what could be performed. A "red director" was appointed to the management by the government to ensure that the MAT’s activities were not counter-revolutionary and that they served the Communist cause. As Russia began a period of rapid industrialization, so too was the MAT encouraged to increase production at the expense of quality, with more and more hastily produced plays going up each season. Plays had to be officially approved, and the Theatre’s artistic integrity started to decline.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The theatre was officially renamed The Gorky Moscow Art Theatre in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Magarshack (1950, 383).&lt;/ref&gt; Desperate not to lose support, Stanislavski tried to appease Stalin by accepting his political limitations on what could be performed while retaining his devotion to naturalistic theatre. As a result, the mid-20th century incarnation of the Moscow Art Theatre took a stylistic turn towards [[Socialist Realism]], which would affect its productions for decades.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

It was not until autumn of 1970 that [[Oleg Yefremov]], an actor, producer, and former student of the Moscow Art Theatre Studios who wanted Russia to once again be a major contender in the theatre world, took over control of the theatre and began to reform it. By the time he arrived to save it, the company was made up of only 150 actors, many of whom were out of practice. Yefremov began to reinstate Stanislavski’s traditions, including emphasizing the importance of the studio and of the system, as well as interviewing every single candidate with special emphasis and attention placed on work ethic.&lt;ref&gt;Smeliansky (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the theatre split into two troupes: the Chekhov Moscow Art Theatre (artistic director [[Oleg Yefremov]]) and the Gorky Moscow Art Theatre (artistic director [[Tatiana Doronina]]). [[Oleg Tabakov]] was the Chekhov Moscow Art Theatre's artistic director from 2000 until his death in 2018. The Chekhov Moscow Art Theatre is located just off [[Tverskaya Street]], within walking distance of [[Red Square]].

is the main town of the [[King Sabata Dalindyebo Local Municipality]] in [[Eastern Cape]] province of [[South Africa]] and the capital of [[OR Tambo District Municipality]]. The town has an [[Mthatha Airport|airport]], previously known by the name K. D. Matanzima Airport&lt;ref&gt;[http://map.primorye.ru/preview.asp?l=eng&amp;v=WORLD-ENG&amp;a=1&amp;sl=%7B%7B%22Airdromes%22,%7B12159%7D%7D%7D&amp;sw=400&amp;sh=400 K D Matanzima Airport]&lt;/ref&gt; after former leader [[Kaiser Matanzima]]. Mthatha derives its name from the nearby Mthatha River which was named after the Sneezewood (umtati) trees, famous for their wood and medicinal properties. &lt;ref name="SAVenues"&gt;{{cite web| title= Umtata| publisher= South African Venues| url=https://www.sa-venues.com/attractionsec/umtata.php | accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Caesar Carl Hans Henkel02.jpg|thumb|left|300px|1913 panoramic view of Mthatha with the [[Mthatha River]] in the foreground and the [[Drakensberg mountains]] in the distance by [[Caesar Carl Hans Henkel]]]]

The settlement existed in the 1870s as a buffer-zone, in response to reported tensions between [[Pondo people|Pondo]] and neighbouring Thembu groups, and in 1875 a magistrate's office was opened, the first magistrate appointed that year being a man named J F Boyes. The settlement developed during the next few years, becoming a military post for the British colonial forces in 1882. The town itself was founded in 1883, along the banks of the [[Mthatha River]]. Nearly a century later, the [[Mthatha Dam]] was constructed about eight kilometers  upstream of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.wrc.org.za/archives/watersa%20archive/2001/October/1372.pdf|title=Situation analysis of water quality in the Umtata River catchment|author=Fatoki, OS, Muyima, NYO and Lujiza, M|format=PDF|journal=Water SA|volume=27|issue=4|date=October 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201140/http://www.wrc.org.za/archives/watersa%20archive/2001/October/1372.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mthatha became the leading administrative center of the area, having both [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|Anglican]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedrals.The town became the headquarters of the Transkeian Territories General Council (known as the Bunga) and building which served as a parliament was erected in 1903.&lt;ref name="SAVenues"&gt;{{cite web| title= Umtata| publisher= South African Venues| url=https://www.sa-venues.com/attractionsec/umtata.php | accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the construction of the town hall in 1908. &lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web| title= Umtata South Africa| publisher= Britannica| url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Umtata | accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A branch of the [[University of Fort Hare]] was established in the town, and after the independence of the [[Transkei]] in 1977 it became the [[University of Transkei]]. In 2005, University of Transkei with Border Technikon and Eastern Cape Technikon were merged to form the [[Walter Sisulu University for Technology and Science]]. The campus was the base for the region's first community radio station, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091017084208/http://www.ucrfm.com/ UCRFM], which started in 1996 and has become a significant community broadcaster.

On 1 August 1973, Mthatha High Court was opened.&lt;ref name="SAVenues"&gt;{{cite web| title= Umtata| publisher= South African Venues| url=https://www.sa-venues.com/attractionsec/umtata.php | accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SAHistoryOnline"&gt;{{cite web| title=A High Court is established in Umtata, capital of the Transkei.  | publisher= South African History Online| url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/high-court-established-umtata-capital-transkeia | accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, a summit meeting of the black homeland leaders was held at Umtata, when they decided to federate their own states after independence. In 1976, [[Transkei]] was granted independence as a bantustan, a nominally independent state not recognised outside of South Africa, and Mthatha served as the capital under the name "Umtata".&lt;ref name="SAVenues"&gt;{{cite web| title= Umtata| publisher= South African Venues| url=https://www.sa-venues.com/attractionsec/umtata.php | accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Transkei regime, an airport named the then leader of Transkei KD Matanzima was built. On 21 May 2012, the airport was formally handed over to Lindiwe Sisulu, then Minister of Defence, by Noxolo Kiviet, then Premier of the Eastern Cape. However, the South African National Defence Force revoked its control of the airport in 2013. The airport was renamed [[Mthatha Airport]].

After the end of apartheid, some sections of the African business and professional community migrated to traditionally white areas of economic activity, and this has been widely posited as a cause of economic recession in the municipality, but a number of construction projects offer some hope for renewal. 

Many of South Africa's black leaders &amp;mdash; including [[Walter Sisulu]], [[Bantu Holomisa]], and [[Nelson Mandela]] &amp;mdash; come from this area, and the retired Mandela visited his home village of [[Qunu]] a few kilometres south of Mthatha.

Mthatha is a focal point of the Nelson Mandela Route which celebrates the life of late Nelson Mandela. There are three Nelson Mandela Museums: Spread across three sites, it collects, interprets and exhibits key aspects of the story of the life and times of Nelson Mandela in context. The three historical sites of the museum are all in the locality at Mvezo, Qunu, and the Bunga Building in Mthatha itself. In the Bunga Building is the story of the ''[[Long Walk to Freedom]]'' and an exhibition of the many gifts received by Nelson Mandela. 

On 2 March 2004 Umtata was renamed "Mthatha".

Mthatha has 2 major taxi businesses (Uncedo Taxi Association and Border Taxi Association). These Taxi Associatios had a feud over The R61 road from Mthatha to Libode and [[Ports St John's]].This Feud resulted Taxi Ranks being closed by The Government. Also over 60 reported human fatalities were reported and the taxis had a gunshots incidents were these reported deaths happened.By 2018 New [[Minister of Police]] [[Bheki Cele]] Closed all taxi ranks in Mthatha and demanded that the Taxi Associations must negotiate with the police about the killings and said that they should merge to form one Taxi Association but they refused and they started taking people legal after Bheki Cele said they shouldn't and some Taxis were taken by the police.Sagasranks where opened in Mthatha but the ranks that were not opened triggered Riot's with people protesting and police firing rubber bullets and teargas with one affecting a nearby school (st John's college).

== Religion ==
The city is the episcopal see of both the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mthatha]] and the [[Anglican Diocese of Mthatha]].

==Economy==

Mthatha falls under OR Tambo District Municipality which is the poorest district in the Eastern Cape in terms of all poverty measures. It has the lowest HDI (0.45) and the highest poverty gap (2 231 million) in the Eastern Cape. The number of people living in poverty is also high in this district (64.6%), unemployment is at 65.5% and the literacy rate 42.2%. &lt;ref name="OLF"&gt;{{cite web| title=Mthatha| publisher= Olive Leaf Foundation| url=http://www.olf.org.za/region/mthatha/380/ | accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 it was reported the King Sabata Dalindyebo Local Municipality was owed R250 million by residents in unpaid service fees—counts among its creditors the South African Revenue Service (to which it owes R18-million), the Public Investment Commission (R84 million), the national water affairs and forestry department (R46 million) and the Development Bank of Southern Africa (R13 million). &lt;ref name="EnochMgijima"&gt;{{cite web | last=Mgibisa | first= Mbuyisa | title= Mthatha in dire straits | publisher=Mail &amp; Guardian| url=https://mg.co.za/article/2006-10-25-mthatha-in-dire-straits | accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to SA Delivery, The average annual income of a black Mthatha resident is R15,762. &lt;ref name="SADELIVERY"&gt;{{cite web | last=Harrison| first= Karen| title= Can Mthatha turn the corner? | publisher=SA Delivery| url=http://sadelivery.co.za/files/back_issues/delivery/Edition18/mthatha%202302.pdf | accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town has also been plagued by complaints around its roads. However, despite that a new dawn is beckoning for Mthatha with the construction of infrastructure like BT Ngebs Mall and Mayfair Hotel.

'''Nagykanizsa''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈnɒckɒniʒɒ}}; {{lang-hr|Kan(j)iža, Velika Kan(j)iža}}; {{lang-de|Großkirchen, Groß-Kanizsa}}, {{lang-it|Canissa}}, {{lang-sl|Velika Kaniža}}, {{lang-tr|Kanije}}) is a medium-sized city in [[Zala County]] in southwestern [[Hungary]]. It is also known in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as '''Kanizsa'''.

It lies not far from [[Lake Balaton]] at the meeting point of five routes. For centuries the town has been a connecting link. Goods from [[Slavonia]] were transported to [[Graz]] via Nagykanizsa, and the town played an important role in the trade from the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the [[Alps|Alpine]] region, [[Vienna]], and [[Budapest]].

==History==
{{Unreferencedsect|date=February 2017}}
The city's oldest Roman era ruins were uncovered in the 1960s. Later, during the Middle Ages, it became one of the most important strongholds of the Hungarian Kingdom. The fortress had a significant role in the southern shield line of Hungary, keeping the whole of Western Europe safe from the attacks of the Ottoman Empire. Instead of conquerors, today Nagykanizsa attracts thousands of [[Dental tourism|dental tourists]] as the modern age's invaders. The name Kanizsa is of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin (''Knysa''), and means "belonging to a prince". It refers to the fact that the region was the property of an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]].

The name Kanizsa was first mentioned in a document in 1245. The Kanizsai family continued building the castle and constructed a rectangular castle with an enclosed back yard on an islet in the River Kanizsa. The town and the castle were in their prime in the first half of the 16th century, when Kanizsa became a centre of trade with Italy and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]].

Szigetvár and Kanizsa became the most important strongholds in southern Hungary. In 1600, the Turkish army occupied the castle. This castle was the center of [[Kanije Eyalet|an Ottoman eyalet]] including the sanjaks of [[Szigetvar|Sigetvar]], [[Törökkoppány|Kopan]], [[Valpovo|Valpuva]], [[Siklos]], Nadaj, and [[Beltinci|Balatin]] until 1690 (see [[Ottoman Hungary]]), when the city was invaded by the Habsburg armies.

In 1601, during the Ottoman-Habsburg War of 1593–1606, a siege began on September 9 and ended on November 18. The Habsburg forces were commanded by [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand the Archduke of Austria]], and [[Tiryaki Hasan Pasha]] was defending the castle. Hasan Pasha won the fight against the ten times bigger army of Austrians with many cunning military ploys, and was raised to the rank of Vizier.

At the beginning of the 18th century, the holder of the castle moved German, Croatian, and Serbian settlers into the deserted town. A particularly mixed ethnic group lived in a suburb called Kiskanizsa. After the Turks were driven out, the town lost its strategic significance, so the [[War Council (Austria)|Vienna war council]] demolished the castle in 1702.

Business became lively, trade became important again, and crafts developed significantly. In 1765, elementary and secondary education was begun by the [[Piarists|Piarist order]] supported by Lajos Batthyány, palatine of Hungary. The first business school of Transdanubia was opened in Nagykanizsa, and in 1895 it was made into a college.

Many people who had attended its schools became famous: [[Benedek Virág]], Pál Király, [[Ferenc Deák]], Károly Kaán, Sándor Hevesi, and [[Ferenc Mező]] all studied in the ancient buildings of Nagykanizsa's "almae matres".

Nagykanizsa started a new phase of large-scale development in the 1860s. The railway connecting Nagykanizsa with Vienna, [[Budapest]], and [[Rijeka]] was constructed at that time. There was rapid development in industry as well. This industrial and business development resulted in the foundation of banks. Besides the four local banks, an Austro-Hungarian and an Anglo-Hungarian bank also opened branch offices in town. Telephone lines were established and the town was connected with a long-distance system in 1895. At the same time, a 70-bed hospital was opened.

During [[World War I]], military barracks were built in the town. This necessitated the construction of a municipal water network. Kanizsa became a modern town; drainage system construction and paving of streets began. World War I caused grave consequences. Kanizsa became isolated and lost its markets in the south and west. Oil helped the town to survive. After successful exploration by the American corporation ''Eurogasco'', Hungarian-American Oil Inc. was formed. Nagykanizsa became the centre of the Hungarian oil industry.

Beer brewed in Kanizsa Brewery regained its reputation as one of the best Hungarian beers, carrying off the palm at more and more international competitions – at the beginning of the century the brewery was closed as demand for beer fell drastically. Kanizsa Trend Ltd. grew out of the company, with its furniture products gaining a high reputation all over Europe. The predecessor of the present day Tungsram Plc, now belonging to [[General Electric]], was opened in 1965. It is now one of the biggest light bulb factories in the world.

Károlyi Park, City Park, and large squares like Kossuth, Eötvös, and Erzsébet squares were extended after 1962. A boating lake was formed, becoming a popular recreation centre.

'''Nahla Valley''' ({{lang-ar|سهل نهلا}}, {{lang-syr|ܢܗܠܐ}}), is a geographic region located in the province of [[Ninawa Governorate|Nineveh]] in [[Aqrah  District]], [[Iraq]]. The [[Sapna valley]] lies to the northwest and is separated by a mountain range, and the city of [[Aqra]] is to the south, separated by another mountain range. It is bound by the [[Greater Zab River]] to the north and east, and the [[Khazir River]] to the west. The valley is mainly inhabited by [[Assyrians in Iraq|Assyrians]] and [[Kurds]], with an [[Iraqi Arabs|Arab]] minority present as well.

==History==
Most of the Assyrians living in Nahla, which number around 20,000, moved there from [[Hakkari]] after the [[Assyrian Genocide]] that occurred during the [[First World War]]. However, some villages were emptied in the 1960s when [[First Iraqi–Kurdish War|fights between the Iraqi government and Kurdish separatists]] forced most of their inhabitants to flee to [[Baghdad]] and [[Mosul]]. Some scarcely populated villages were completely destroyed later on during the [[Anfal genocide]] in the 1980s as well. The population of the valley grew considerably following the [[Iraq War]], as many Assyrians living in [[Dora, Baghdad|Dora]] and [[Mosul]] started settling back in the region.

There is significant friction between the Kurds and Assyrians in the valley, with a history of violence, land [[squatting]], and voting suppression since the establishment of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aina.org/news/20151203044630.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On July 17, 1999 an armed group belonging to the Patriotic Revolutionary Organization of Bet Nahrain attacked a PDK [[Peshmerga]] position in the region in retaliation for the murder of an Assyrian girl. The attack resulted in 39 deaths and 20 injured on the Kurdish side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/1999/29-060899.html Iraq Report 6 August 1999, Volume 2, Number 29], GlobalSecurity.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pamphilus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Pamphilus de amore'' in a [[incunable]] printed ca. 1480-1484 in [[Zaragoza]] by [[Pablo Hurus]] and [[Juan Planck]]]]
'''''Pamphilus de amore''''' (or, simply, '''''Pamphilus''''') is a 780-line, twelfth-century Latin comedic play, probably composed in  [[Medieval France|France]] but possibly [[Medieval Spain|Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Vincente Cristóbal, 'Ovid in Medieval Spain', in ''Ovid in the Middle Ages'', ed. by James G. Clark, Frank T. Coulson and Kathryn L. McKinley (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), pp. 231-56 (p. 241).&lt;/ref&gt; It was 'one of the most influential and important of all the many pseudo-Ovidian productions concerning the "arts of Love" ' in medieval Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jay Garbaty, 'Pamphilus, de Amore: An Introduction and Translation', ''The Chaucer Review'', 2 (1967), 108-34 (p. 108), https://www.jstor.org/stable/25093043.&lt;/ref&gt; and 'the most famous and influential of the medieval [[Elegiac comedy|elegiac comedies]], especially in Spain'.&lt;ref&gt;Vincente Cristóbal, 'Ovid in Medieval Spain', in ''Ovid in the Middle Ages'', ed. by James G. Clark, Frank T. Coulson and Kathryn L. McKinley (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), pp. 231-56 (p. 241).&lt;/ref&gt; The main protagonists are Pamphilus and Galatea. Pamphilus seeks to woo Galatea through the mediation of a [[procuress]] (inspired by the procuress in Book 1.8 of [[Ovid|Ovid's]] ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Vincente Cristóbal, 'Ovid in Medieval Spain', in ''Ovid in the Middle Ages'', ed. by James G. Clark, Frank T. Coulson and Kathryn L. McKinley (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), pp. 231-56 (p. 241).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==

According to Thomas Jay Garbaty, 'The Latin original abounds in all aspects of medieval rhetoric as outlined by [[Geoffrey de Vinsauf]], in his ''[[Poetria Nova]]'', specifically ''repetitio'', paradox, oxymoron, alliteration. It is obvious that the author sacrificed much dramatic tension and liveliness for elegance of style'.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jay Garbaty, 'Pamphilus, de Amore: An Introduction and Translation', ''The Chaucer Review'', 2 (1967), 108-34 (p. 110), https://www.jstor.org/stable/25093043.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

''Pamphilus de amore'' gave rise to the word ''pamphlet'', in the sense of a small work issued by itself without covers, because the poem was popular and widely copied and circulated on its own, forming a slim [[codex]]. The word came into [[Middle English]] ca 1387 as ''pamphilet'' or ''panflet''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'' [[s.v.]] "pamphlet".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OEtDpamphlet&gt;{{OEtymD|pamphlet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pamphilus'' swiftly became widely read: it was quoted and anthologised already in England, France, Provence, and Italy in the early thirteenth century. It is first attested in the Netherlands c. 1250, in Germany c. 1280. It is attested in Castile by c. 1330. It remained popular in England into the late fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jay Garbaty, 'Pamphilus, de Amore: An Introduction and Translation', ''The Chaucer Review'', 2 (1967), 108-34 (p. 108), https://www.jstor.org/stable/25093043.&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated into [[Old Norse]] in the thirteenth century, as ''Pamphilus ok Galathea'',&lt;ref name="Marianne E 1985"&gt;Marianne E. Kalinke and P. M. Mitchell, ''Bibliography of Old Norse–Icelandic Romances'', Islandica, 44 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1985), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; and into French by Jean Brasdefer as ''Pamphile et Galatée'' (c. 1300×1315).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jay Garbaty, 'Pamphilus, de Amore: An Introduction and Translation', ''The Chaucer Review'', 2 (1967), 108-34 (p. 108), https://www.jstor.org/stable/25093043.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Gower]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] knew the poem, Chaucer drawing on it particularly in ''[[The Franklin's Tale]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''; it also influenced the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]''; [[Boccaccio|Boccaccio's]] ''[[Fiammetta]]'' drew inspiration from it; and it was adapted in [[Juan Ruiz|Juan Ruiz's]] Don Melon/Dona Endrina episode in the ''[[Libro de buen amor|Libro de Buen Amor]]'' (from the earlier fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jay Garbaty, 'Pamphilus, de Amore: An Introduction and Translation', ''The Chaucer Review'', 2 (1967), 108-34 (pp. 108-9), https://www.jstor.org/stable/25093043.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Jenkins''' (born April 3, 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite linked authority file|id=n82-107557|accessdate=May 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a professor of history at [[Baylor University]] in the United States, and co-director for Baylor's Program on Historical Studies of Religion in the Institute for Studies of Religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.baylor.edu/history/index.php?id=87862 | work = Faculty: Philip Jenkins | title = Distinguished Professor of History  | publisher = [[Baylor University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the Edwin Erle Sparks Professor of Humanities Emeritus at [[Pennsylvania State University]] (PSU). He was professor (from 1993) and a distinguished professor (from 1997) of history and religious studies at the same institution; and also assistant, associate and then full professor of criminal justice and [[American studies]] at PSU, 1980–93.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://php.scripts.psu.edu/dept/history/faculty/jenkinsPhilip.php|publisher=Department of History &amp; Religious Studies Program, Penn State University|accessdate=May 22, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317105946/http://php.scripts.psu.edu/dept/history/faculty/jenkinsPhilip.php|archivedate=March 17, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenkins is a contributing editor for ''[[The American Conservative]]'' and writes a monthly column for ''[[The Christian Century]]''. He has also written articles for ''[[Christianity Today]]'', ''[[First Things]]'', and ''[[The Atlantic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/p/jpj1/vita.pdf PSU resume]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and work==
Jenkins was born in [[Port Talbot]], [[Wales]], in 1952 and studied at [[Clare College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], taking double first–class honours in both History and [[Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, University of Cambridge | Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic Studies]].  Jenkins then studied for his PhD under the supervision of Sir [[John H. Plumb|John Plumb]] among others. Between 1977 and 1980, Jenkins worked as a researcher for Sir [[Leon Radzinowicz]], the pioneer of criminology studies at Cambridge.

In 1979, Jenkins won the BBC quiz show ''[[Mastermind (TV series) | Mastermind]]''.{{Sfn | Jenkins | 1983}}

==Academic career==
In 1980, Jenkins was appointed Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at [[Pennsylvania State University]], which marked a change in his research focus. Jenkins has forged a reputation based on his work on global [[Christianity]] as well as on emerging religious movements. Other research interests include post-1970 American history and [[crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://php.scripts.psu.edu/dept/history/faculty/jenkinsPhilip.php | work = Department Faculty | title = Philip Jenkins — History and Religious Studies | publisher = [[Pennsylvania State University]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080317105946/http://php.scripts.psu.edu/dept/history/faculty/jenkinsPhilip.php | archivedate = March 17, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He conducted a study of the [[Quran]] and the [[Bible]] in the light of the [[September 11 attacks]] and accusations that the Quran incites violence. However, he found that "the Bible contains far more verses praising or urging bloodshed than does the Quran."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Al Jazeera |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/rizkhan/2010/03/201032584118951469.html |date=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public intellectual==
In 2002 Jenkins, who is a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]-turned-[[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Jenkins|first= Philip|title=The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice|year=2003|chapter=Preface|page=vii|publisher=Amazon|type=Look Inside|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; discussed the [[Catholic sex abuse cases]] by asserting that his "research of cases over the past 20 years indicates no evidence whatever that Catholic or other celibate clergy are any more likely to be involved in misconduct or abuse than clergy of any other denomination—or indeed, than non-clergy. However determined news media may be to see this affair as a crisis of celibacy, the charge is just unsupported."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forum: The myth of the 'pedophile priest'|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/forum/comm/20020303edjenk03p6.asp|date=March 3, 2002|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=May 16, 2010|last=Jenkins|first=P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 interview with [[National Public Radio]], Jenkins stated that he believes that "the Islamic scriptures in the [[Quran ]] were actually far less bloody and less violent than those in the [[Bible]]" and cites explicit instructions in the [[Old Testament]] calling for [[genocide]] while the Quran calls for primarily defensive war. Jenkins went on to state that [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]] had undergone a process that he refers to as "holy amnesia" in which violence in sacred texts became symbolic action against one's sins. Islam had until recently also undergone the same process in which [[jihad]] became an internal struggle rather than war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124494788&amp;ps=cprs|title=Is The Bible More Violent than The Quran?|first=BB|last=Hagerty|accessdate=May 16, 2010|date=March 18, 2010|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5193">'''Pierre Amandry''' was a French [[hellenist]], especially interested with [[ancient Greece]] and its relationships with the Orient.  He was born at [[Troyes]] on December 31, 1912, and died in Paris on February 21, 2006.  A large part of his work was on the site of [[Delphi]], excavated by the [[French School at Athens]], of which he was secretary general from 1941-1948 and director from 1969-1981.

== Career ==
He joined the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in 1933, become a professor in 1937, and was member of the [[French School at Athens]] from 1937 to 1941.  During this time, he carried out excavations in the sanctuary of Delphi, where he discovered treasure of gold and ivory under the sacred way.  The study of these objects led him to be interested in oriental art and, in general, in the relationships between occidental and oriental artistic production, notably in architecture and jewelry.
From 1951 to 1969, he taught at the University of [[Strasbourg]].

His thesis on ''La mantique apollinienne à Delphes'' (The Apollonic Divination at Delphi) refuted the romantic image of the consultation of the [[Pythia]] in favor of a more prosaic function of the [[Delphic oracle]].

He is the author of a number of articles concerning the monuments at Delphi, in particular the temple.

He was elected to the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] in 1972.

Aside from his work on ancient Greece, he was equally interested in modern Greece and in travelers.  He translated "Christ recrucifié", written by Nikos Kazandzaki (1955), into French.

'''Press TV''' (stylised as '''PRESSTV''') is a 24-hour English- and French-language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=presstv.com|url=http://www.presstv.com/French/|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=youtube.com - PressTV français|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr7bk7QUEcevcntGOM0OFKA|accessdate=30 April  2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; news and documentary network affiliated with [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]] (IRIB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/middle_east/country_profiles/790877.stm|title=Country Profile: Iran|date=30 November 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; IRIB is state-owned but independent of the [[Iranian government]] in its management and is the only legal TV and radio broadcaster inside Iran. IRIB's head is appointed directly by the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]], [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]], and is considered to be close to the country's [[Iranian Conservatives|conservative political faction]]. Press TV is headquartered in [[Tehran]] and has offices and bureaus around the world, including [[London]], [[Beirut]], [[Damascus]], [[Kabul]] and the [[Gaza Strip]].

==Background==
Press TV CEO [[Mohammad Sarafraz]] said in a June 2007 press conference that, "Since September 11, Western bias has divided the media into two camps: those that favour their policies make up one group and the rest of the media are attached to radical Islamic groups like [[Al-Qaeda]]. We want to show that there is a different view. Iran, and the [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'as]] in particular, have become a focal point of world propaganda. From the media point of view, we are trying to give a second eye to Western audiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1182409649771&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter |title=Iran launches English TV news station |work=Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network's [[corporate mission|official vision]] is "to heed the voices and perspectives of the people of the world; build bridges of [[Cultural sphere|cultural understanding]]; encourage human beings of different nationalities, races and creeds to identify with one another; bring to light untold and overlooked stories of individuals who have experienced [[political division|political and cultural divides]] firsthand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presstv.ir/About.html |title=Press TV |publisher=Presstv.ir |date=27 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319225322/http://www.presstv.ir/about.html |archivedate=19 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarafraz explained that "our experience tells us that pictorial reflection of news and the use of images are more effective than discussion and analysis."&lt;ref name="presstv.ir"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=95142&amp;sectionid=351020105|title=Press TV offers viewers new experience|date=18 May 2009|accessdate=29 December 2009|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519190932/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=95142&amp;sectionid=351020105|archivedate=19 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of website and satellite TV launch===
The network's website launched in late January 2007.&lt;ref name="APBU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abu.org.my/public/dsp_page.cfm?articleid=2631&amp;urlsectionid=1061&amp;specialsection=ART_FULL&amp;pageid=247&amp;PSID=3372|title=IRIB-Iran launches Press TV website|accessdate=27 June 2007|publisher=Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union|date=24 January 2007|work=ISNA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220231442/http://www.abu.org.my/public/dsp_page.cfm?articleid=2631&amp;urlsectionid=1061&amp;specialsection=ART_FULL&amp;pageid=247&amp;PSID=3372|archivedate=20 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Test satellite transmissions were conducted in late April 2007.

==Funding and management==
Press TV is state-funded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/03/world/asia/03iht-web0703iran.6459744.html|title=Iran expands role in media, via satellite and in English|last=Fathi|first=Nazila|work=New York Times|accessdate=29 December 2009 |date=2 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a division of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]] (IRIB), the only legal TV and radio broadcaster inside the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2014/feb/06/iran-president-hassan-rouhani-healthcare-obamacare |title=Rouhanicare: Iran's president promises healthcare for all by 2018 |last1=Dehghan |first1=Saeed Kamali |authorlink=Saeed Kamali Dehghan |date=6 February 2014 |work=[[The Guardian]] |quote=...&amp;nbsp;IRIB is independent of the Iranian government and its head is appointed directly by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

World news | The Guardian.&lt;/ref&gt; Press TV's headquarters are located in [[Tehran]].

As of 2009, the annual budget of Press TV is 250 Billion [[Iranian rial|rials]] (more than US$8.3 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mehrnews.com/fa/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=519985|title=بودجه پرس تی‌وی 25 میلیارد تومان است / میزان پخش فیلم‌های ایرانی و خارجی متعادل می‌شود|publisher=Mehr News|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage==
[[File:PressTV at University of Johannesburg.jpg|thumbnail|PressTV shooting at [[University of Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]]]
Press TV offers round-the-clock news bulletins every half-hour, a series of repeating commentary programmes and round-table panel discussions, as well as documentary-style political films. In May 2009, Press TV CEO Mohammad Sarafraz announced that Press TV would "provide viewers with more newscasts while cutting down on its news analysis programs."&lt;ref name="presstv.ir" /&gt;

Press TV was created for the purpose of presenting news, images and arguments, especially on Middle Eastern affairs, to counter the news coverage that appears on broadcasts such those of [[BBC World News]], [[CNN International]] and [[Al Jazeera English]].&lt;ref name="BBC-launch"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6260716.stm |title=Iran launches English TV channel |accessdate=6 August 2007 |date=2 July 2007 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to mediachannel.org, "the government aims to use Press TV to counter what it sees as a steady stream of Western propaganda against Iran as well as offer an alternative view of world news."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediachannel.org/wordpress/2007/07/13/irans-press-tv-to-give-alternative-view/ Mediachannel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108084856/http://mediachannel.org/wordpress/2007/07/13/irans-press-tv-to-give-alternative-view/ |date=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By launching an English-language television network to promote an Iranian perspective of the world, together with an Arab-language station, the [[Al-Alam News Network]], the Iranian government said it hoped "to address a global audience exposed to misinformation and mudslinging as regards the Islamic Republic of Iran."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gozaar.org/template1.php?id=1348&amp;language=english|title=A Guided Tour of Press TV|last=Ekhtiari|first=Khosro|date=15 September 2009|publisher=[[Gozaar]]|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two networks focus on "difficult issues in the Middle East such as the United States’ occupation of neighbouring Iraq and the Shiite question."&lt;ref name=samati&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38417 |title=New TV Channel to Focus on Iraq, Shia Issues |last=Sanati |first=Kimia |date=4 July 2007 |publisher=[[Inter Press Service|IPS]] |accessdate=29 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121014222/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38417 |archivedate=21 January 2009 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, viewers can watch Press TV and the English, Arabic, and Spanish-language versions of its sister networks iFilm and Hispan TV on numerous [[free-to-air]] satellites worldwide. Official satellite footprint maps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/Frequencies.html|title=PressTV|website=www.presstv.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; and satellite enthusiast-maintained transponder change notifications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.kingofsat.net/channelhistory.php?ch=4803|title=KingOfSat - Change Log|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also available and may at times be necessary to consult.

==Controversies==
{{main article|Press TV controversies}}

In 2012, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) issued a report alleging that Press TV has been broadcasting what the ADL says are examples of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] conspiracy theories and opinions.&lt;ref name="adl.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran's Press TV: Broadcasting Anti-Semitism To English-Speaking World|url=http://www.adl.org/anti-semitism/united-states/c/press-tv-iran.html|accessdate=13 November 2013|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report criticizes Press TV for interviewing or providing commentary space for a number of individuals (such as [[David Duke]]) described by the report as "American anti-Semites, conspiracy theorists and [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]], who help amplify the Iranian regime's hateful messages".&lt;ref name="adl.org" /&gt;

The station has been criticized for "anti-Americanism" and "uncritical embrace of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]". For British journalist [[Nick Cohen]] the station is "a platform for the full [[fascism|fascist]] conspiracy theory of supernatural Jewish power"&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Nick Cohen [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/04/nick-cohen-press-tv-hatred "Who will rid us of hate channels such as Press TV?"], ''The Observer'', 4 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and for commentator [[Douglas Murray (author)|Douglas Murray]] it is the "Iranian government’s propaganda channel".&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Murray [http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2012/01/push-off-now-press-tv-and-take-your-conspiracy-theories-with-you/ "Push off now, Press TV, and take your conspiracy theories with you"], ''The Spectator'' (blog), 20 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 interview on Press TV, [[George Galloway]], one of the station's presenters and  a British politician, responded to Cohen and others, stating that Press TV "challenges the prevailing orthodoxy" by providing an outsider perspective on "the truth and a voice for the otherwise voiceless".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail/214493.html "Ofcom will not silence Press TV"], transcript of an interview with George Galloway, Press TV, 8 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mehdi Hasan]] of the ''[[New Statesman]]'' has argued that "engaging with Iran, no matter who is in charge in Tehran, is a prerequisite for peace and progress in the region. The very fact that Press TV is Iranian-owned makes it the ideal English-language platform on which to do so."&lt;ref&gt;Mehdi Hasan [http://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/2009/07/mehdi-hasan-press-iran-british-channel "Book me a slot on Press TV"], ''New Statesman'' (blog), 16 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC journalist Linda Pressly has described Press TV as pro-Palestinian, opposed to [[sanctions against Iran]], and critical of [[Western world|Western]] foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16317282|title=Iran's battle for TV influence takes shape on Press TV|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 April 2012|author=Linda Pressly}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nick Ferrari]], a former presenter of one of Press TV's shows, told ''The Times'' that Press TV's news coverage had been "reasonably fair" until the 2009 election—but not any longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6613209.ece|location=London |work=The Times|author=Martin Fletcher|title=Presenter Nick Ferrari quits Iran Press TV over bias after election|date=1 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal from Western and Asian satellites===
On April 3, 2012, Munich-based media regulator ''[[:de:Bayerische Landeszentrale für neue Medien]]'' ('''BLM'''), announced it was removing ''Press TV'' from the [[SES S.A.|SES]] [[Astra (satellite)|Astra satellite]], as it did not have a licence to broadcast in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=265184 Iran slams BBC over film about Israel relations], Jerusalem Post, 7 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/234717.html|title=Press TV ban refutes West’s claims on freedom of expression: Lawmaker|date=5 April 2012|work=Press TV|accessdate=10 April 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408051551/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/234717.html|archivedate=8 April 2012|deadurl=yes|publisher=IRIB|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the channel's legal team submitted documents to the court that proved Press TV could broadcast under German law. Munich's Administrative Court announced on Friday 15 June that the ban was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2012/06/15/246364/german-court-lifts-ban-on-press-tv/|title=German court lifts ban on Press TV|date=15 June 2012|work=Press TV|accessdate=16 June 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618023026/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2012/06/15/246364/german-court-lifts-ban-on-press-tv/|archivedate=18 June 2012|deadurl=yes|publisher=IRIB|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2012 the channel became unavailable on Astra 19.2E after the High Administrative Court of Bavaria had overturned the urgent ruling and confirmed the regulatory authority's decision.

In November 2012, the [[Hong Kong]]-based [[AsiaSat]] took Iranian channels off air in East Asia, and in October 2012 [[Eutelsat]] and [[Intelsat]] stopped broadcasting several Iranian satellite channels, though the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]] managed to resume broadcasts after striking deals with smaller companies that are based in other countries.&lt;ref name="intelsat" /&gt; In July 2013 Press TV and other Iranian channels were removed from several European and American satellites (amongst others those of Eutelsat and Intelsat), allegedly because of the Iran sanctions, even though an EU spokesperson told the channel that these sanctions do not apply to media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Intelsat to take Iranian satellite channels off air|date=26 June 2013|agency=Press TV|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/06/26/310864/intelsat-to-take-iranian-channels-off-air/|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807165924/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/06/26/310864/intelsat-to-take-iranian-channels-off-air/|archivedate=7 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intelsat"&gt;{{cite news|title=Iranian channels dropped by Intelsat|date=2 July 2013 |work=[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]|url=http://www.aawsat.net/2013/07/article55308059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maziar Bahari and UK licence revocation===
In June 2010, [[Channel 4]], the British broadcaster, transmitted a programme featuring [[Maziar Bahari]], a documentary maker and ''[[Newsweek]]'' contributor, who was arrested while covering the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|Iranian presidential election in 2009]], and held in custody for 118 days. He alleged that a Press TV 10 second interview and 'confession' had been preceded by torture, and was given under the threat of execution.&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;Kylie Morris and Katie Brown [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/ofcom-investigates-irans-press-tv-over-interview-1996131.html "Ofcom investigates Iran's Press TV over 'interview'"], ''The Independent'', 19 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Bahari, now a British resident, complained to [[Ofcom]], the regulatory authority for the telecommunication industries in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Morris" /&gt;

In May 2011, Ofcom ruled that Press TV was responsible for a serious breach of UK broadcasting rules by airing the 10 second interview with Maziar Bahari, accepting that it had been obtained under duress while he was held in a Tehran jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/23/iran-press-tv-maziar-bahari|title=Iran's Press TV censured for interview with arrested journalist|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=23 May 2011|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 May 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Press TV rejected Ofcom's findings and accused Bahari of being "an [[MI6]] contact person".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail/181242.html "A British game against PressTV"], Press TV, 22 May July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A fine of £100,000 was eventually imposed in November 2011, reversing an initial decision to revoke Press TV's licence.&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;Patrick Foster [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/nov/30/ofcom-iran-press-tv "Ofcom reverses decision to revoke licence of Iran's Press TV"], ''The Guardian'', 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Press TV responded: "The British royal family exercises an overarching power over all branches in the political system of the UK, including the government and the parliament, as well as on Ofcom."&lt;ref name="Foster" /&gt; On 20 January 2012, Press TV's licence to broadcast in the UK was revoked by Ofcom.&lt;ref name="Sweney"&gt;Mark Sweney [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/20/iran-press-tv-loses-uk-licence "Iran's Press TV loses UK licence"], ''The Guardian'', 20 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-licence-conditions/press-tv-revocation.pdf|title=The Ofcom document explaining the revocation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation into the Bahari case had revealed the applying company's direct connection to Tehran, and that editorial control came from there. An invitation to change this in the licence had not been taken up by Press TV.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16652356 "Iran's Press TV loses UK licence"], BBC News, 20 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The unpaid fine was not the reason why Ofcom ended Press TV's licence.&lt;ref&gt;David Blair [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9028435/Britain-bans-Irans-Press-TV-from-airwaves.html "Iran's Press TV loses UK licence"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 20 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey Alderman]], the British historian and occasional Press TV contributor, attacked the Ofcom decision, and called for it to be reversed. He described the action by Ofcom as "thoroughly deplorable as well as palpably cynical".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Alderman [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/24/suppressing-press-tv-ofcom-licence?newsfeed=true "Suppressing Press TV is deplorable – Ofcom should restore its licence now"], ''The Guardian'', 24 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders of Press TV, including Alderman and the broadcaster's legal representative, Farooq Bajwa,&lt;ref&gt;Linda Pressly [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16317282 "Iran's battle for TV influence takes shape on Press TV"], ''The Report'', BBC Radio 4, 29 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; have referred to a formerly secret American diplomatic cable dated 4 February 2010. Later released by [[WikiLeaks]], it says the British Government was at time "exploring ways to limit the operations of the IRIB's Press TV service". This 'exploration' was in response to the jamming by the Iranian government of broadcasts by the BBC Persian Service and the [[Voice of America]], also mentioned in the document&lt;ref&gt;Cable cited at [https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/247209 "US embassy cables: Retaliation planned after Iran jammed BBC broadcasts"], ''The Guardian'' (website), 5 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and mentioned by Alderman.

{{History of West Virginia}}

The '''[[protohistory|protohistoric]] period of the state of [[West Virginia]]''' in the United States began in the mid-sixteenth century with the arrival of European trade goods. Explorers and colonists brought these goods to the eastern and southern coasts of North America and were brought inland by native trade routes. This was a period characterized by increased intertribal strife, rapid population decline, the abandonment of traditional life styles, and the extinction and migrations of many Native American groups.

Written accounts of the area begin by the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century with the scattered documentation and journals of early explorers. These accounts frequently portray a sparsely inhabited area, possibly due to the [[Iroquois]] wars to monopolize the European fur trade&lt;ref name=WVAENCYCSPENCER&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The West Virginia Encyclopedia|title=Fort Ancient Culture|url=http://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/2037|first=Darla S.|last=Spencer|accessdate=March 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the devastating effects of new diseases introduced by Europeans.

==Archaeological cultures==
During the climatic warming of the [[Medieval Warm Period]] (900–1200 CE), the introduction of the bow and arrow and maize led many [[Woodland period#Late Woodland period (500–1000 CE)|Late Woodland period]] groups in Eastern and Southern North America to develop sedentary agriculture based societies, which lead to larger populations.

The harsh droughts and cold winters during the [[Little Ice Age]] (sixteenth to nineteenth centuries),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.meteo.psu.edu/~mann/shared/articles/littleiceage.pdf|title=Little Ice Age|first=Michael E.|last= Mann|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|location=Chichester|year=2002|pages=504–509|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NASA Scientific Visualization Studio,|title=The Sun's chilly impact on Earth|url=http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/stories/iceage_20011207/|accessdate=March 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; put these larger groups under severe social stress as they competed for scarcer resources, such as less timber, less fertile farm land and fewer game animals. These groups were already unstable when Europeans arrived during the sixteenth century with superior weapons and diseases to which the native populations had no resistance. Many of these groups are now only known through the archaeological record.

===Fort Ancient and Monongahela===

Groups of the [[Fort Ancient]] and [[Monongahela culture]]s lived in the western part of the state (and in the adjoining states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio and Kentucky) along the [[Ohio River]] and its tributaries. Late Fort Ancient (1400 to 1750) and Late Monongahela (1580 to 1635) peoples began consolidating their villages into larger settlements with more defensive measures such as wooden [[palisade]]s during this time. Archaeologists suggest that this means that intergroup strife had increased, with the smaller settlements amalgamating into larger entities for mutual protection.

Loup Creek wall, "Trees of all sizes and varieties may be seen growing up through the heaps of loose stones which were once built into the wall. One of these which I particularly noticed was a red oak fully three feet in diameter and not less than four hundred years old. This would indicate that the wall had been abandoned at least that long if not longer. The mystery to be solved is who were the builders of this wall and why was it constructed. William Morris the first permanent settler of the county located in the vicinity of this wall in 1774 and his descendants claim that he was told by the Indians that the wall was there when the latter came into the Valley. It is quite clear to every inquiring mind that the Indians were not its builders but that it was no doubt constructed by the same race that built the mounds and inhabited the territory of the United States for centuries prior to its settlement by the Indians." Quote from George Wesley Atkinson, 1876 (Public Domain), Page 94, "History of Kanawha County: from its organization in 1789 until the present".&lt;/ref&gt; The uses of the walls are unknown, but they may have been used to control movement through the regions &amp; seem to have also been used as traps to pen in and slaughter Forest Buffalo &amp; other large game, according to a great deal of animal bones found at such sites.

This region was inhabited by members of several different major language families when Europeans first arrived. These groups shared similar cultures, but spoke languages that had diverged from each other over thousands of years. Archaeological cultures such as the Monongahela and Fort Ancient groups may have been confederacies whose constituent members did not all speak a common language instead of individual tribes or communities. The major language groups inhabiting the West Virginia region were the [[Central Algonquian languages|Central Algonquian]], [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] and [[Siouan languages|Ohio Valley Siouan]].

In the seventeenth century, Native Americans groups had not yet formed the large political “tribes” known from the historical era during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and many tribal names used in historical literature do not apply in the seventeenth century. Many tribal names were actually amalgamations of earlier groups that had been decimated by wars and disease and banded together for mutual safety. Groups were also known by many different names, which also made identifying specific groups difficult. Group names were often recorded before the group met Europeans, and was frequently the name that enemies knew them by and in a different language family from what the group themselves spoke. These names were then transliterated into several European written languages, particularly French, English, Dutch, and Spanish. These European languages often had different phonetic stylings for the foreign languages of the Native Americans, and this translation and transliteration was conducted in an era before many modern writing conventions, resulting in inconsistent spelling, grammar and alphabetic characters.

===Algonquian groups===
The [[Algonquian peoples]] were one of the most populous and widespread North American native language groups, with tribes originally numbering in the hundreds. They were most concentrated in the New England region. The [[Central Algonquian languages]] are a subgroup of the Algonquian family, itself a member of the [[Algic languages|Algic language family]]. The languages are grouped together because they were spoken near each other, not because they are any closer related to one another than to any other Algonquian language. Within the Central Algonquian grouping, the only languages known to be more closely related to each other than to any other Algonquian languages are [[Potawatomi language|Potawatomi]] and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]. However, there is some evidence for a larger subbranch "Eastern Great Lakes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Costa|first=David J.|year=2003|title=The Miami-Illinois Language|location=Lincoln|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Core Central", consisting of [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]-[[Potawatomi language|Potawatomi]], [[Miami-Illinois language|Miami-Illinois]], [[Fox language|Fox-Sauk-Kickapoo]], and [[Shawnee language|Shawnee]], and excluding [[Cree language|Cree-Montagnais]] and [[Menominee language|Menominee]]. At the time of the European arrival, the ''Haudenosaunee'' or [[Iroquois Confederacy]] was regularly at war with its Algonquian neighbours and forced other tribes out of Iroquois-occupied territories.

Among the [[Cornstalk]] oratory, there is a story of young Kentucky warriors who mistakenly massacrued "Spiritual or Holy People" in southwest Kentucky. This young gang's trophies were declared not Spanish by the elders upon return to Kentucky counsel. A similar story was told by other Shawnee to the 1770s surveyors at the Scioto village (Thomas Bullitt 1773 with Shawnees at Chillicothe, also similar legend explored by Joseph 2010:78&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Frank, ''Advanced Civilizations of Prehistoric America: The Lost Kingdoms of the Adena, Hopewell, Mississippians, and Anasazi'', Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Company, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;). The now old Chief at the Mouth of the Kanawha explained why they passed beyond the western of the state to build their towns on the [[Scioto River|Scioto valley]] in western [[Ohio]]. This policy also applied to game taking in West Virginia.

Ouabano was a band of [[Mohicans]] or Eastern [[Lenape]], like the others westerly of the state, who traded with the Spanish before the French arrival. It was [[Munsee language|Minsis]] and [[Mohican]] who led some Shawnee from Lower Ohio Valley in 1692 to join the Minisink villagers of the Delaware (Hanna 1911:158). Soon, these provided guides followed by the Viele of Albany Expedition. The Shawnee arrived later in the century by 1697 on the Eastern Panhandle with Sauvanoos from the south east colonies (Darlington; Hanna). Batts and Fallams, 1671, briefly mentions an abandoned Mohican village (Mohecan as transcribed journal entry date September 16, 1671, Summers 1929&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Preston Summers, Abingdon Virginia, 1929, The Expedition of Batts and Fallam: A Journey from Virginia to beyond the Appalachian Mountains, September, 1671.

===Iroquoian groups===
The [[Iroquoian languages]] have a common historical and cultural origin, which later diverged to create different languages. [[Archaeological]] evidence shows that Iroquois ancestors lived in the [[Finger Lakes region|Finger Lakes]] and surrounding regions from at least 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jennings|first=Francis|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=jfxdH5pslt4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Ambiguous%20Iroquois%20Empire%3A%20the%20Covenant%20Chain%20Confederation%20of%20Indian%20Tribes%20with%20English%20Colonies%20from%20Its%20Beginnings%20to%20the%20Lancaster%20Treaty%20of%201744&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|title=The Ambiguous Iroquois Empire: the Covenant Chain Confederation of Indian Tribes with English Colonies from Its Beginnings to the Lancaster Treaty of 1744|location=New York|publisher=Norton|year=1984|isbn=0-393-01719-2|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; These languages include [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], [[Wyandot language|Huron-Wyandot]], [[Neutral Nation|Neutral]], [[Erie (tribe)|Erie]] and [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]], among others. Members of the Iroquois Confederacy ([[Seneca Nation|Seneca]], [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]], [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]], [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] and [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]]) speak Iroquoian languages that are distinctly different from those of other Iroquoian speakers.

In 1649 the tribes constituting the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Tionontati|Petun]] confederations were displaced by war parties from the Iroquois Confederacy. Many of the survivors went on to form the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] tribe. The languages of the tribes that constituted these confederations were very poorly documented. These groups were called ''Atiwandaronk'' meaning 'they who understand the language' by the [[Wyandot people|Huron]], and thus are historically grouped with them. After becoming united in the League, the Iroquois invaded the [[Ohio River Valley]] in present-day [[Kentucky]] to seek additional hunting grounds. One theory is that the Iroquois had pushed tribes of the [[Ohio River]] valley, such as the [[Quapaw]] (Akansea) &amp; [[Saponi]], out of the region in a migration west of the [[Mississippi River]] by around 1200 CE, however Iroquoian tribes no longer held this land by the 17th century.&lt;ref name="ohs"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Louis F. |last=Burns |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OS001.html |title=Osage |encyclopedia=Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |accessdate=March 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102050914/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OS001.html |archivedate=January 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert La Salle]] listed the [[Mosopelea]] among the Ohio Valley peoples defeated by the Iroquois in the early 1670s, during the [[Beaver Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles A.|last=Hanna|title=The Wilderness Trail|location=New York|publisher=Putnam Brothers|year=1911|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Siouan-speaking groups had settled in the Midwest by 1673, establishing what became known as their historical territories. Just as the Siouan peoples were displaced by the Iroquois, they displaced less powerful tribes whom they encountered in the Midwest, such as the [[Osage Nation|Osage]], who moved further west.&lt;ref name="ohs"/&gt;

Iroquoian cultural was matrilineal, several families of girls and brothers from the same maternal lineage shared a longhouse. A married man moved into his wife's longhouse. Unlike the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] of upstate New York, West Virginia saw no large centralized sovereign national governments of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s. The extent of ''proto-Iroquoia'' and ''proto-Shanwan'' cultural and language in West Virginia was similar to the [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]]' ([[Laurentian language]]). By the fourteenth century, a distinct St. Lawrence Iroquoian culture had created fortified villages and introduced corn to the St. Lawrence valley.&lt;ref&gt;Pendergast, James F (Journal of Canadian Studies, Winter 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

They may have been part of the [[Erie people]], and were bitter enemies of the Iroquois Confederacy for control of the fur trade like their Erie and Huron allies.&lt;ref name=SUSQUEHANNOCK/&gt; These tribes ought to have been centered east of the Kanawha River and held little land in what is now West Virginia.

The [[Erie people]] or ''Cat Nation'' (also known as the ''Nation de Chat'', ''Rickohockans'', and ''Rechahecrians'') appear on Edward Bland's "Discovery of New Brittaine" map dated August 31, 1650, in the New River-Holston divide watershed region. Coming from beyond the Monetons, the Rickahockans or Ricahecrians entered Piedmont Virginia in 1656. This eastern Virginia [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] phrase referred to "from beyond the mountains." This groups has been identified in various ways, including as ancient Cherokee, as a Cat Nation division called ''Rique'', and as "Riquehronnons" or "Rigueronnons".&lt;ref&gt;The Bureau of American Ethnology identifies these Indians with the Cherokee [Mooney, Siouan Tribes of the East, also Handbook of American Indians, art. "Cherokee"]. They have also been identified with the Erie or Rique, who were defeated and expelled from their home on Lake Erie in 1655. [See Parkman, Jesuits in America, 438–441; Charlevoix, History of New France, vol. ii, 266.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neutrals====
The Chonnonton ("people of the deer",&lt;ref name=CANENCYC&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url= http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/neutral/|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|first=William C.|last=Noble|title=The Neutral Connfederacy|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the people who tend or manage deer"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wampumkeeper.com/wkauthorintro.html|title=The Wampum Keeper|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120718015700/http://wampumkeeper.com/wkauthorintro.html|archivedate=July 18, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) were known as the [[Neutral Nation]] by the Europeans (first named so in 1615 by [[Samuel de Champlain]] because they were then at peace with the Iroquois Confederacy and the Hurons) and the ''Attiwandaronk'' by the Hurons, meaning "people whose speech is awry or a little different".&lt;ref name=CANENCYC/&gt; They were based in the Hamilton-Niagara district of southwestern Ontario and across the Niagara River in Western New York state but had trading and war alliances with many of the surrounding Iroquoian-speaking peoples including the [[Petun]], Huron, [[Wenro]], Kakwa, Erie, Andasté, Massawomek and the Iroquois Confederacy. During the early seventeenth century the Neutrals had reached a political sophistication previously unknown in this part of the country and may have even been a nascent chiefdom. This chiefdom consisted of ten tribes with a governing council united under a warrior-priest-chief named ''Tsouharissen'' ("Child of the Sun").&lt;ref name=CANENCYC/&gt; Like other groups, their adoption of maize agriculture had let them develop a large population. They were the largest native society in the area in the mid-seventeenth century and may have had a population as high as 40,000 with 4,000 to 6,000 warriors. Unlike other groups, they may have also begun to semi-domesticate [[white tail deer]], as several early reports detail how they kept them in pens to manage them for the lucrative trade in fur and skins. The chiefdom failed in 1646 with the death of the ''Tsouharissen'', and in 1651 the Iroquois Confederacy were able to annihilate their old enemies. By 1671 they are no longer mentioned in the historical records.&lt;ref name=CANENCYC/&gt;

These early Iroquois or proto-Iroquoians were from an earlier ''Neutralia'' trade network south of the [[Wyandot people|Huron]]ian of the [[Canadien]] region south of [[Lake Erie]].&lt;ref&gt;Noble 1994*.&lt;/ref&gt; The Iroquois League destroyed the [[Neutral Nation]]'s trade network by 1653. The Rickohockans arrived in Virginia soon after this. Although both peoples, the Rickahockans and later Westo, were characterized as very aggressive and warring, they were thought to be expelled from [[Lake Erie]] by the Iroquois League leaving an estimated 700 to 900 warriors to arrive in the early Virginia colonial trade area.

===Siouan groups===
Linguistic and historical records indicate a possible southern origin of Siouan peoples, with migrations over a thousand years ago from North Carolina and Virginia to Ohio. Some peoples continued down the Ohio River to the Mississippi River and up the Missouri River, and others across Ohio to Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota, home of the [[Sioux|Dakota]]. Ohio Valley Siouan (Southeastern Siouan) is a group of related [[Siouan languages]], which included the [[Ofo language]], [[Biloxi language]], and the [[Tutelo language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Siouan Languages in the East|work=American Anthropologist|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.1958.60.4.02a00120/pdf|accessdate=March 5, 2011|last=Strurtevant|first=William C.|publisher=American Anthropological Association|volume=60|issue=4|year=1958|pages=738–742|doi=10.1525/aa.1958.60.4.02a00120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tutelo language was a group of [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible dialects]] spoken by the Tutelo, [[Monacan (tribe)|Monacan]], [[Manahoac]] and Nahyssan confederacies, and [[Occaneechi]] in what is now Virginia and West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Siouan Tribes and the Ohio Valley|work=American Anthropologist|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.1943.45.1.02a00050/pdf |accessdate=March 5, 2011|last=Swanton|first=John R.|publisher=American Anthropological Association|volume=45|issue=1|year=1943|pages=49–66|doi=10.1525/aa.1943.45.1.02a00050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mosopelea====
[[File:Clip of Franquelin's map of Louisiana 1684.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Franquelin 1684 map showing Mosopelea]]
Franquelin's map of 1684 shows tribal villages of eastern Siouan [[Mosopelea]] group, which had been destroyed on the central region [[Ohio River]]. On August 5, 1684, the [[New York (state)|New York]] [[Iroqouis]] were encouraged to take control of the Ohio Valley to establish New York trade from the lower half of the Ohio Valley with the French.&lt;ref name="Broshar, 1920:232"&gt;Broshar, 1920:232.&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented Albany Trade began with the Vielle of Albany during the 1692–94 expedition. Virginians were already trading with groups in West Virginia at this point.&lt;ref name="Wood 1674"&gt;Wood 1674.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mohetans====
[[File:Jamesrivermap.png|thumb|right|James River watershed of the [[Monacan (tribe)|Monacan]] leads to West Virginia]]
The Mohetans were the earliest Native American tribe reported by Virginians in central West Virginia. They are found during the Batts and Fallams' 1671 Expedition, and this expedition also found evidence that others colonists preceded them into the area. Earlier authors considered Mohetan to be a northernmost Mountain Cherokee; today, scholars consider them Eastern Siouan. A "Sepiny" Indian guide of the Sapony River returned to the expeditionary party and reported that he heard a drum and a gunshot towards the north, possibly the [[Greenbrier River|Greenbrier]] or [[Gauley River]] valleys. A Mohetan runner met the Virginian and Siouan group to discover whether they were planning to attack or not, and was given ammunition for his European gun. This was prior to [[Bacon's Rebellion]], the Virginian farmers uprising against their locale tribes in 1676.

====Monetons and Monecans====
[[File:1707-Leiden.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Susquesahanock and Monacan in 1707]]
Monetons traded with Tomahitans of [[Holston River]] Valley and adjoining lower [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] region. Today, there is a growing consensus that Monetons were Eastern Siouan and possibly a westerly branch of the [[Virginia]] [[Monacan (tribe)|Monacan]], also known as the Manachee.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney 1894:28.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this theory is moderated when looking at the archaeology of Eastern [[Tennessee]] of the [[Yuchi]] (Cisca) and the late Clover Phase of West Virginia (1550-1650), although the lingua franca or Virginia trade language, Occaneechi, is thought to be their primary language.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin 2009, WVAS.&lt;/ref&gt; This acculturated multi-tribe permitted others to live with them as subordinate Siouan ''Occaneechi''.

From 800 to 900 CE, the latest Woodland hamlet farmers (i.e. Drew Tradition) were experiencing milder weather&lt;ref&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (2010, July 22).

Retrieved September 18, 2010, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100722102041.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of corn. Around 1250, just prior to the Woodland II period (1350–1607), the [[Monacan (tribe)|Monacan]], or Algonquian called "Mandoag", were driven by enemies from the northwest into the Piedmont [[James River]] region of Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Hantman in his '' 'Monacan Archaeology of the Virginia Interior' '', 1993, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; There they found an hunter-gathering people who did not grow corn. Monacan legend reports that they taught the [[Doeg (tribe)|Doeg]] how to crop farm. The Doeg's language is similar to [[Piscataway language|Piscataway]] or [[Nanticoke language|Nanticoke]].

==Other historic groups==
Many native groups other than the Algonquian, Iroquois, and Sioux also inhabited this area. For example, the Occhenechees, also known as the [[Akenatzy]], were the middle men in the regional trade network. Another group known as the Ocanahonon dressed like Europeans and carried curved swords at a village ten days west beyond the mountains by 1607.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Ocanahonon archaeological sites excavated between the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in the Ohio Valley have been found with both gun and knife parts. Trade goods found here and in the greater "Riviere de la Ronceverte" were likely the result of intertribal contact.

===Canaragay===
The Canaragay lived near the [[New River (Kanawha River)]] watershed region in north-western [[North Carolina]] area. This southern [[Appalachian Mountain]] chain heads a number of rivers that drain directly to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], directly to the Atlantic Ocean and the Ohio Valley thence to the [[Mississippi River]], which drains to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The west slope of the divide has the [[Holston River]]. This area is now part of the [[Kingsport–Bristol–Bristol, TN–VA MSA|Kingsport–Bristol (TN)–Bristol (VA) Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

[[John Lederer]], on behalf of the colonial governor of Virginia, Sir [[William Berkeley (governor)|William Berkeley]], made expeditions into the Appalachians in 1669 and 1670 reaching the mouth of the Kanawha River and reported no hostilities on the Kanawha Valley from the early "Cherokee People". He settled in western Maryland and made trips to the head waters of the Potomac area. The Iroquoian stock of the Virginias, Nottoway or Mangoac and allied Meherrin and remnant Susquehanna, calling themselves ''Chiroe&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;haka,'' according to James Mooney. In the north, this linguistic grouping was called Mingo or Mengwe by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] trade or New England [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] stock.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney 1894:7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; John Lederer's guide was a Susquehanna on his journey to southwest Virginia and North Carolina, home of the Early Cherokee people.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney 1894:32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomahittans===
The Tomahitans developed from either the Yuchi or the Cherokee from eastern Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, R. P. Stephen Jr., The Travels Of James Needham And Gabriel Arthur Through Virginia, North Carolina, And Beyond, 1673–1674 Southern Indian Studies [Vol. 39, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Hernando de Soto Expedition in 1542 and the Captain Juan Pardo Expedition in 1568 made contact with the ancient Uchi, who were also referred to as the Chisca. In western North Carolina Hernando Moyano attacked and burned the Chisca village of Maniatique ([[Saltville, Virginia]]) on the upper [[Holston River]] near the New River watershed during the spring of 1567.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Beck and Rodning, Joara and Fort San Juan: culture contact at the edge of the world, Antiquity Vol 78 No 299 March 2004, {{cite web|url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/moore/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724171011/http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/moore/index.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1675, the Yamasee were regularly recorded by the Spanish of the missionary provinces of Guale (central Georgia coast) after being pushed to northeastern Florida from the [[Savannah River]] by the [[Westo]].

===Kanawha===
[[File:NewRiver watershed.png|right|thumb|Kanawha-New River watershed.]] [[File:Monon CheatRiver.png|thumb|right|Monongahela drainage system, Cheat River highlighted.]]

Kanawha canoemen moved trade along the Ohio Valley and its tributaries of the Oniasantkeronons and Siouan, while Messawomeake moved trade from here across the [[Allegheny Mountains]] in the Earliest Historic period. Kaháwa means "boat" (canoe) in the local Iroquois dialect. It varies with Iroquois "kahôwö". [[Chief Cornstalk]]'s Shawnese ([[Chalahgawtha]]) word for canoe was locally "Olagashe". Iroquois (Tuscarora, Mingoe &amp; Canawagh) call the anglicized Kanawha River "Ka(ih)nawáˀkye," meaning "waterway," and "kye" is an augmentive suffix. The ''ih'' and variant ''h'', a string of moving water as to a stream, river. "Kényua" is a verb meaning to row a boat or to ferry someone across a stretch of water.&lt;ref&gt;Lachler, McElwain, and Burke: Etymology of kényua' -NYU- Verb Root. Grammatical Info Base -nyu-. Stem Class LX. Conjugation Class XX. kényua' "I row boats".&lt;/ref&gt; The Canawagh (Kanawhas) were last reported as a band in 1774 in the St. Albans area (Hanson Journal) and reportedly joined other Iroquois (Lewis) while some Kanawhan mixed with Shawnee moving to the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] near the trade posts.&lt;ref&gt;John Heckewelder (Loskiel): Conoys, Ganawese, etc. explains Charles A. Hanna (Vol II, 1911:96, Ganeiens-gaa, Margry, i., 529; ii., 142–43,) using La Salle's letter of August 22, 1681 [[Fort Saint Louis (Illinois)]] mentioning "Ohio tribes" for extrapolation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Piscataway moved up to the Conoy Island in the [[Maryland]] region in 1699 after a long Siouan occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Scheel.&lt;/ref&gt; Later researchers declared that "Kanawha" was not [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] [[Shawnee]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert S. Gatschet, 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; The state does have Algonquian phrases, though these may be from protohistoric Ouabano, ancient Telegwa, or later [[Mekoche|Makujay]] influence.&lt;ref&gt;Draper &amp; Belue 1998:202; Pritchard 2002:274.&lt;/ref&gt;

White traders began establishing trading houses in the Ohio, Allegheny, and Monongahela valleys in 1717, according to University of Pittsburgh's ''Historic Pittsburgh''. Pennsylvania fur trader Michael Bezallion made a record of his trip from [[Illinois]] country up the Ohio en route to [[Philadelphia]] in 1717. The Iroquois established a town at Kanaugha opposite the Mouth of the Kanawha before 1748,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs 1953; Adair, Atkins Report of 1755.&lt;/ref&gt; and the French constructed a fort nearby prior to the French and Indian War.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson 1876:21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Wilber R., '' 'The Appalachian Indian Frontier: The Edmond Atkin Report and Plan of 1755.'

[[Pierre Joseph Céloron de Blainville|Céloron de Blainville]], a French Canadian officer with a flotilla of canoes, encountered English traders with canoes nearby on August 12, 1749.

Hudson's Trading Post Inn and canoe landing, a hunter's camp, village, and archaeological mound site, appeared on Madison's 1807 map opposite St. Albans.

The Oniasantkeronons are of probably of the Kanawha River area.&lt;ref&gt;Hoñniasontke'roñnon, D.B. Ricky 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The hills or mountains south of the Kanawha have been known by several names, including Waseoto, Osioto, Osiata, Oseoto, and Onosiota (La Posta). The ruins of a square fort at the mouth of Bull creek on the [[Coal River (West Virginia)|Coal River]], thirty miles upstream of [[St. Albans, West Virginia|St. Albans]] on the Kanawha River has been recorded on maps of the area.

The earliest location of the Calicuas is depicted as a province north of the [[Chisca]] (Uchi) and Appalachians according to the Narrative of De Soto's expedition in 1540-1541. Calicuas is found on Ortelius's 1570 map and 1642 on the Blaeuw map. The next map by Merian was issued about 1650 now with more correct geography showing the Calicuas along the general area of West Virginia. The Guyandottes appeared in southwestern West Virginia and southern Ohio around this time, pushing out from the Acansea (Ohio) Valley the Calicua and [[Mosopelea]] (Ohio [[Ofo language|Ofo]]) peoples according to the progressing of contemporary maps.

This era is sometimes called a fire-side cabin culture, which is associated with eighteenth-century hunters. Historical trader Charles Poke's trading post dates from 1731 with these "Trade Indians", then called [[Cherokee]], stemming from this earlier period called [[Valley Falls State Park|Cherokee Falls]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Balderson, ''Wonderful West Virginia'' articles "Allegeny" and ''Wonderfull West Virginia'' September 1973, Pp.30, "Valley Falls of Old",&lt;/ref&gt; The Calicua were reported on the [[Tygart Valley River]] and [[Cheat River]] region in 1705 and 1707, which are supported by several contemporary maps.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas de Fer 1715 map.&lt;/ref&gt; Fort Lyttelton and Fort Shirley were built in 1755–56 by the fur trader and Indian agent [[George Croghan]]. [[Andrew Lewis (soldier)|Colonel Andrew Lewis]] had roughly estimated sixty [[Virginia]] Cherokee with him on the Big Sandy Expedition to this area in 1756.

===Tionontatacaga===
Tionontatacaga (Tobacco Indians, Iroquois) trade mixing from easterly regional tributaries of [[Lake Erie]] were generally traditional [[Iroquois League]] enemies. The early historic Ohio Valley Siouans were neighbors with the Cat Nation of Erielhoran to the northeast and their trade neighbor on their eastern environs, the Neutral Nation. The prehistoric culture of the Cat Nation region was named for Charles Whittlesey, a nineteenth-century geologist and archaeologist who began the studies of the Whittlesey Culture (1000 to 1600) and founded the Western Reserve Historical Society of Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Whittlesey, Charles. "Descriptions of Ancient Works in Ohio." Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge 3 (1850).&lt;/ref&gt; Fort Ancient people grew beans at least 1150–1200. Neighboring to the west along Lake Erie's tributaries were the palisaded villages of the Sandusky culture (1400–1500). Late Woodland people were south of the Sandusky people and southwest of the Whittlesey people on the rolling hill watershed of these tributaries in Ohio. A connection of these various Prehistoric people with historic tribes remain unclear for the increasing migrations (Ohio Historical Society).

Chief Tsouharissen included a council which united some ten tribes within the Neutralia empire. French [[Recollet]] friar Daillon in 1626 reported three large deer pens near his village, Ounontisaston. They called themselves Chonnonton, or "people of the deer." Because these ranging trademen were at peace earlier with the League and [[Wyandot people|Huron]], in 1615 Champlain called them, "la Nation neutre." They traded deer hides and byproducts to as far south as the [[Powhatan]] chiefdom on [[Chesapeake Bay]] for the prized Snow Whelk&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Bretton W. 1982. An overlooked Busycon whelk (Melongenidae) from the eastern United States, Nautilus 96(3):99–104. (July 16, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Buccinidae]]) [[Mollusca|marine shell]]s. The Iroquois League in 1651 destroyed this cultural entity. Having been pushed south and pressuring the Siouan, these [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] mix again disseminated. Like the decades earlier of some northerly environ [[Yuchi]], some Tionontatacaga joined the Shawnee and other Wyandot were known as Little Mingoe (Gist 1750–51). The [[Guyandotte River]] was named in their memory.

It cannot be understated, however, that the Wyandots, or Guyandotte, of West Virginia came to be extremely far from the Ohio Wyandot over time &amp; may have been operating as a separate tribe, also fractured from the Petun. Its possible that they may be the Kentatentonga mentioned on Franquelin's map, with a whopping 19 villages in northwest Pennsylvania having been destroyed.&lt;ref name="Franquelin 2017"/&gt;

===Shenandoah===
Several historic references speak of a separate tribe living in the Shenandoah River Valley along West Virginia's eastern border known as the Senandoa, or Shenandoah, until approximately 1715. It is during this time that they were allegedly destroyed by the Catawba—the most likely scenario being that they sided the Yuchi during the Yamasee War, whereas the Catawbas of North Carolina backed the Yamasee. They appear to have been mound builders, and so may have been associated with the Monongahela Culture to the northwest, who were the only mound building society surviving in the region by that time. While confusion still remains as to whether they could have been associated with the Iroquois, Algonquians or Siouans, they may have, in fact, been a separate tribe from other known groups who passed through the region during the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;https://peopleofonefire.com/the-shenandoah-valley-of-virginia-its-secret-native-american-history.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstsettlersshenandoahvalley.com/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; They seem to share little to no cultural traits with their Saponi neighbors. Many make a point that the place has been largely forgotten and rarely explored by Archaeologists, warranting a closer look.

It's difficult to say what happened to the remaining Senandoa. They may have merged with the Yuchi. Some may have also gone to live among the Saponi to the east, who appear to have remained neutral in the Yamasee War &amp; were being collectively referred to as the Christannas at the time. In the 1883 paper "Tutelo Tribe and Language," Horatio Hale met with the last full-blooded Tutelo living among the Iroquois Confederacy in Canada, Waskiteng/ Nakonha. The man claims that he was 106, remembered times before the American Revolution &amp; claimed that his people's village in New York was referred to as Tutelo, but was made up of a mixture of "Tutelos, Saponis &amp; Botshenins." Although it is assumed that Botshenin may be a nickname for Occaneechi (The three tribes were all Christannas &amp; were a core group who stuck close to one another throughout the 18th century), no one has yet seemed to identify this tribe who they are for certain.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, Horatio "Tutelo Tribe &amp; Language" (1883), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade==

===Spanish and French trade===
[[File:Eastern-Buffalo lg.jpg|right|thumb|Perhaps the only contemporary "painting" of the extinct Eastern Forest Buffalo on map from 1687. Notice the horn representation.]] [[File:Clip of Franquelin's map of Louisiana 1684.jpg|thumb|right|LaSalle sailed to France in November 1683 accompanied by Franquelin who created the map in 1684.]] In the northern part of [[Chickasaw]] country below the confluence of the Wabash and Ohio area of the Chaouanons, Jolliet and Marquette met a band of Iroquoian origin in 1673, which they identified as either Tuscarora or Cherokee.&lt;ref&gt;Kellogg 1917:251,252.&lt;/ref&gt; They were reported as trading with the Spanish to the east and had firearms. The French explorers were above the thirty third latitude, in the northern Spanish trade country. John Peter Salley passed through this region describing the Ohio Falls area as a Spanish Manor, beginning on the Kanawha River in 1742. The wild cattle are often assumed to be a smaller subspecies of the Eastern Forest [[American Bison|Buffalo]], which is now extinct. The last buffalo seen and killed in West Virginia killed in Boone county in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Wonderful West Virginia, Brooks 1976:26,27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Above the neck of the Potomac, [[Augustine Herman|Augustin Herrman]] charted a map from 1659 to 1670,&lt;ref&gt;Wroten, Dr. William H., Jr., Delmarva Heritage Series, Nabb Research Center General Resources – Special Collections &amp; Exhibits, Mapmaker Came To State As Enemy, Enemy Turned Friend, Part I published i 1673&lt;/ref&gt; which shows the unidentified major branching rivers leading into the Allegheny Mountains. These rivers on the map lead into the eastern valleys of West Virginia to the Greenbrier area divide. His explorer parties evidently did not pass through the gaps of the [[Monongahela National Forest]].

Documenting early United States history for the Nation's centennial became a popular subject of historians by 1876. Early settlers plowing the fields of Old Town Creek near the Mouth of the Kanawha found more than eighty gun barrels collectively.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson 1876:19.&lt;/ref&gt; These settlers also found an anvil, hammers and other evidence of blacksmith ware nearly two centuries after they were distributed in the archaeological records. Before formal archaeological records, locals disinterred tomahawks, pewter basins, and other artifacts from area mound formations.

The [[Neutral Nation]] formed a league of eight hundred Upper Algonquians in 1653.&lt;ref&gt;Legislative Assembly 1908:449.&lt;/ref&gt; This league was located southwest of Skenchioe, near a Fox village in the Flat Country of [[The Thumb]], [[Michigan]]. The [[Erie (tribe)|Cat Nation]] Neighbored the Upper Algonquians to the east and scattered around the southern shore of [[Lake Erie]].&lt;ref&gt;Jes. Rel. 1647–48, xxxiii, 63, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Relation of 1656 (vol. xlii., p.&amp;nbsp;197).&lt;/ref&gt; From the other direction, kindred Kentaientonga villages were destroyed by Iroquois as they told to the French years afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Sultzman, First Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; At Le Chine in 1669 at [[Montreal Island]],&lt;ref&gt;The nation, Vol 56, No. 1456, 1893:384,&lt;/ref&gt; La Salle was told to expect to find Chaouanon (Algonquian) and Honniasontkeronon (Iroquois) villages on the Ohio above the falls or above [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanna 1911:158.&lt;/ref&gt; Exploration information was seldom shared between different European nations. The Andasté (Chiroe&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;haka) found on maps as Calicuas territory impeded the New York Haudenosaunee and the French Canadien trade in this region at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney 1894, Wallace 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York trade===
Trade between New York and the Ohio Valley region began around 1692-94, though trade between the Ohio Valley area and Fort Henry (Virginia) began at least two decades earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Broshar, 1920 page 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence also indicates that intertribal trade included Europeans began long before this. Under the name Chaskepe in 1683, some Cisca seem to have joined with the [[Shawnee]] who relocate to [[Starved Rock State Park|Fort St. Louis]] in [[Illinois]] and lived among the French trade (Hanna).

Nearly a century later, local stories were still being told of this period of warring and trade establishment. [[George Washington]] was about fifteen miles below [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], [[Marshall County, West Virginia|Marshall County]] according to his entry on Thursday October 25, 1770. An early Cut Creek Indian town was wiped out on Cut Creek (Fish Creek) by the Six Nations ([[Haudenosaunee]]) according to the hired Crawford Indians ([[William Crawford (soldier)]] Iroquois-like George Ck neighbors) and the two Croghan Indians aboard with him from White Mingos Castle.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, Jackson &amp; Twohig 1976:293,294.&lt;/ref&gt; These western Virginia Indians explained the geography of each stream they passed on the [[Ohio River]] to and up the Great Kanawha. With some of the hired Indians, George Washington spent the night of November 2, 1770 at the old hunters camp at the 10 Mile Creek before returning to the main camp at the Mouth of the Kanawha.&lt;ref&gt;LOC, Jackson &amp; Twohig 1976:307,308.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days before, he and some of the expedition party hunted through Old Town Creek area near the Old Shawnatown.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virginia trade===
[[File:Smith map ver 6 1624.jpg|thumb|right|The Susquesahanock spoke an Iroquois dialect and were fort builders. They were allies with the Huron Confederacy. A Susquesahanock site is located in the Eastern Panhandle at [[Moorefield, West Virginia]]. [[Captain John Smith]] 1612 map.]]

Trade from the [[Allegheny Mountains]] region began with [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. In the 1999 Interim Report,&lt;ref&gt;Mallios and Strube, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; the Massawomeck offered gifts of bows and arrows, deer and bear flesh, fish, clubs, and bear skins to John Smith during his [[Chesapeake Bay]] exploration in 1608. Next, the Susquesahanock came down and presented venison, tobacco pipes, baskets, targets, bows and arrows.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, I:231.&lt;/ref&gt; A large cashe of small and very well made dark flint Levanna, and small excellently proportioned Madison arrow points appear to be from some of these trade or gifts at the Jamestown archaeological site.

In the early seventeenth century, a situation of Messawomeake, from beyond the western slopes of the upper [[Allegheny Mountains]], migration to the upper Potomac area for the sake of being closer to English trade ware appears. This was battling circumstances with the Iroquois Trade middlemen the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] [[Nacotchtank]] in 1632. Leaving French Canadian trade, they arrived and began trade with Captain Henry Fleet on the upper Chesapeake Bay. Messawomeake settled northerly tributaries of the upper [[Potomac River|Potomac Valley]]. It appears a period of general peace followed with the Algonquian down the Potomac.

In the 1640s, the [[Virginia Colony]] built [[Fort Henry (Virginia)|Fort Henry]] and traded with the [[Siouan languages|eastern Siouan]] of proto-historic West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;First Biennial Report of the Department of Archives and History of the State of West Virginia&lt;/ref&gt; A fort built of particular protohistoric interest was the James River Fort of [[William Byrd I]] established in 1676. It was still closer to Tutelo groups, elemental Swanton's Toteras of interest, and its nearby Monacan east of [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]] area and Kanawhan [[Monetons]] following Wood's 1674 contact. Monecaga were a westerly subset of [[Monacan (tribe)|Monacan]]. According to [[John Lederer]], The Monacan had been driven by enemies from the northwest into [[James River]] and [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] region of [[Virginia]] around 1250. There they found a hunter-gatherer people who did not grow corn. Along with Shattera, these were among the Occane-Uchi Virginia trade through the south of the state.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="163009">Various aspects of the '''relationship between religion and science''' have been cited by modern historians of science and religion, philosophers, theologians, scientists, and others from various geographical regions and cultures. Even though the ancient and medieval worlds did not have conceptions resembling the modern understandings of "science" and "religion", certain elements of these modern ideas are found throughout history. It was in the 19th century when the phrases "religion and science" or "science and religion" first emerged in literature.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt; This coincided with the refining of "science", from the studies of "[[natural philosophy]]", and "[[religion]]" as distinct concepts in the last few centuries partly due to professionalization of the sciences, the Protestant Reformation, colonization, and globalization.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Before Religion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy" /&gt; Since then, many have characterized the relationship as either conflict, harmony, complexity, or mutual independence.

Both science and religion are complex social and cultural endeavors that vary across cultures and have changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stenmark|first1=Mikael|title=How to Relate Science and Religion: A Multidimensional Model|page=45|date=2004|publisher=W.B.

Science Before the Greeks (On changes in science here)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scientific and technical innovations prior to the [[scientific revolution]] were achieved by societies organized by religious traditions. Elements of the [[scientific method]] were pioneered by ancient pagan, Islamic, and Christian scholars. [[Roger Bacon]], who is often credited with formalizing the scientific method, was a Franciscan friar.&lt;ref name="First Scientist, Clegg"&gt;Clegg, Brian. [https://www.amazon.com/First-Scientist-Life-Roger-Bacon/dp/0786713585/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372950566&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Roger+Bacon "The First Scientist: A Life of Roger Bacon"]. Carroll and Graf Publishers, NY, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism has historically embraced reason and empiricism, holding that science brings legitimate, but incomplete knowledge of the world and universe. Confucian thought has held different views of science over time. Most Buddhists today view science as complementary to their beliefs. While the classification of the material world by the ancient [[Mahābhūta|Indians]] and [[Ancient Greece#Science and technology|Greeks]] into [[Classical elements|air, earth, fire and water]] was more philosophical, medieval [[Science in the medieval Islamic world#Notable scientists|Middle Easterns]] used practical and experimental observation to classify materials.&lt;ref name=Jim&gt;''[[Science and Islam (documentary)|Science and Islam]]'', [[Jim Al-Khalili]]. [[BBC]], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Events in Europe such as the [[Galileo affair]], associated with the scientific revolution and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], led scholars such as [[John William Draper]] to postulate a [[conflict thesis]], holding that religion and science have been in conflict methodologically, factually and politically throughout history. This thesis is held by some contemporary scientists such as [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Lawrence Krauss]], [[Peter Atkins]], and [[Donald Prothero]]. The conflict thesis has lost favor among most contemporary historians of science.&lt;ref name="Russel, C.A. 2002 7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Russel, C.A.|editor=Ferngren, G.B.|year=2002|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|page=7|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|isbn=0-8018-7038-0|quote=The conflict thesis, at least in its simple form, is now widely perceived as a wholly inadequate intellectual framework within which to construct a sensible and realistic historiography of Western science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shapin1996&gt;{{cite book| author = Shapin, S.| year = 1996| title = The Scientific Revolution| page = 195| publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]]| isbn =| quote = In the late Victorian period it was common to write about the 'warfare between science and religion' and to presume that the two bodies of culture must always have been in conflict.

H.| year = 1991| title = Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives| page= 42| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]| isbn =| quote = In its traditional forms, the conflict thesis has been largely discredited.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scientists, philosophers, and theologians throughout history, such as [[Francisco J. Ayala|Francisco Ayala]], [[Kenneth R. Miller]] and [[Francis Collins]], have seen compatibility or independence between religion and science. Biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]], other scientists, and some contemporary theologians hold that religion and science are [[non-overlapping magisteria]], addressing fundamentally separate forms of knowledge and aspects of life.  Some theologians or historians of science, including [[John Lennox]], [[Thomas Berry]], [[Brian Swimme]] and [[Ken Wilber]] propose an interconnection between science and religion, while others such as [[Ian Barbour]] believe there are even parallels.

Public acceptance of [[Fact#Fact in science|scientific facts]] may be influenced by religion; many in the [[United States]] reject evolution by [[natural selection]], especially regarding human beings. Nevertheless, the American [[National Academy of Sciences]] has written that "the evidence for evolution can be fully compatible with religious faith", a view officially endorsed by many religious denominations globally.&lt;ref name=nas&gt;{{cite book|title=Science, Evolution and Creationism|author=Committee on Revising Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences and Institute of Medicine of the National Academies|year=2008|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11876.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of "science" and "religion" are a recent invention: "religion" emerged in the 17th century in the midst of colonization and globalization and the Protestant Reformation,&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Before Religion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Japan Religion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt; "science" emerged in the 19th century in the midst of attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSACM"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Numbers|editor1-first=Ronald|editor2-last=Lindberg|editor2-first=David|title=When Science and Christianity Meet|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=3–4|isbn=0-226-48214-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt; Originally what is today known as "science" was pioneered as "natural philosophy". Furthermore, the phrase "religion and science" or "science and religion" emerged in the 19th century, not before, due to the reification of both concepts.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title=The Territories of Science and Religion|date=2015|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-18448-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Jon|editor1-last=Shank|editor1-first=MIchael|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Harrison|editor3-first=Peter|title=Wrestling with Nature : From Omens to Science|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226317838|pages=254–255, 259, 260|chapter=10.

It was in the 19th century that the terms "Buddhism", "Hinduism", "Taoism", "Confucianism" and "World Religions" first emerged.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ananda"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Josephson|first1=Jason Ananda|title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=1, 11–12|isbn=0-226-41234-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths about Religions|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin roots of both science (''scientia'') and religion (''religio'') were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues, never as doctrines, practices, or actual sources of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;

It was in the 19th century that the concept of "science" received its modern shape with new titles emerging such as "biology" and "biologist", "physics" and "physicist" among other technical fields and titles; institutions and communities were founded, and unprecedented applications to and interactions with other aspects of society and culture occurred.&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cahan|editor1-first=David|title=From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences: Writing the History of Nineteenth-Century Science|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-08928-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[scientist]]'' was first coined by the naturalist-theologian [[William Whewell]] in 1834 and it was applied to those who sought knowledge and understanding of nature.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' dates the origin of the word "scientist" to 1834.&lt;/ref&gt; From the ancient world, starting with Aristotle, to the 19th century, the term "[[natural philosophy]]" was the common term used to describe the practice of studying nature.&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Edward|title=A History of Natural Philosophy: From the Ancient World to the Nineteenth Century|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-68957-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac Newton's book [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), whose title translates to "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", reflects the then-current use of the words "natural philosophy", akin to "systematic study of nature". Even in the 19th century, a treatise by [[Lord Kelvin]] and Peter Guthrie Tait's, which helped define much of modern physics, was titled [[Treatise on Natural Philosophy]] (1867).

It was in the 17th century that the concept of "religion" received its modern shape despite the fact that ancient texts like the Bible, the Quran, and other sacred texts did not have a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written.&lt;ref name="Before Religion"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nongbri|first1=Brent|title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept|date=2013|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-15416-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; In the 19th century, [[Max Müller]] noted that what is called ancient religion today, would have been called "law" in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]].

Race, Nation, or Religion?'' ( Philadelphia: Dropsie College Press, 1936).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sanskrit]] word "[[dharma]]", sometimes translated as "religion", also means law or duty. Throughout classical [[South Asia]], the [[Dharmaśāstra|study of law]] consisted of concepts such as [[Prāyaścitta|penance through piety]] and [[Ācāra|ceremonial as well as practical traditions]]. Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between "imperial law" and universal or "Buddha law", but these later became independent sources of power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toshio Kuroda|Kuroda, Toshio]] and Jacqueline I.

Speech presented at "Science and Religion in the Middle Ages," in Harvard University, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; The works of [[Aristotle]] played a major role in the institutionalization, systematization, and expansion of reason. [[Christianity]] accepted reason within the ambit of faith. In [[Christendom]], reason was considered subordinate to [[revelation]], which contained the ultimate truth and this truth could not be challenged. Even though the medieval Christian had the urge to use their reason, they had little on which to exercise it. In medieval universities, the faculty for natural philosophy and theology were separate, and discussions pertaining to theological issues were often not allowed to be undertaken by the faculty of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=God and Reason in the Middle Ages|last=Grant|first=Edward|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-511-03262-5|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}}

Natural philosophy, as taught in the arts faculties of the universities, was seen as an essential area of study in its own right and was considered necessary for almost every area of study. It was an independent field, separated from theology, which enjoyed a good deal of intellectual freedom as long as it was restricted to the natural world. In general, there was religious support for natural science by the late Middle Ages and a recognition that it was an important element of learning.&lt;ref name="Grant1990" /&gt;

The extent to which medieval science led directly to the new philosophy of the scientific revolution remains a subject for debate, but it certainly had a significant influence.&lt;ref name="Hall1994" /&gt;

The Middle Ages laid ground for the developments that took place in science, during the [[Renaissance]] which immediately succeeded it. With significant developments taking place in science, mathematics, medicine and philosophy, the relationship between science and religion became one of curiosity and questioning.&lt;ref name="Hall1994"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scientific Renaissance, 1450-1630|last=Hall|first=Marie Boas|publisher=Dover publications|origyear=1962|year=1994|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}} As [[humanism]] became more and more popular, people tried to understand the nature around them better, rather than turn to religious aspirations. Renaissance humanism looked to classical Greek and Roman texts to change contemporary thought, allowing for a new mindset after the Middle Ages. Renaissance readers understood these [[Classics|classical texts]] as focusing on human decisions, actions and creations, rather than blindly following the rules set forth by the Catholic Church as "God's plan." Though many Renaissance humanists remained religious, they believed God gave humans opportunities and it was humanity's duty to do the "best and most moral thing". Renaissance humanism was an "ethical theory and practice that emphasized reason, scientific inquiry and human fulfillment in the natural world," said [[Susan Abernethy|Abernethy]].&lt;ref name="Szalay2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/55230-renaissance.html|title=The Renaissance: The 'Rebirth' of Science &amp; Culture|last=Szalay|first=Jessie|date=June 29, 2016&lt;!-- 11:09am ET--&gt;|website=www.livescience.com|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1630, ancient authority from classical literature and philosophy, as well as their necessity, started eroding, although scientists were still expected to be fluent in [[New Latin|Latin]], the international language of Europe's intellectuals. With the sheer success of science and the steady advance of [[rationalism]], the individual scientist gained prestige.&lt;ref name="Hall1994" /&gt;

Along with the inventions of this period, especially the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]], allowed for the dissemination of the [[Bible]] in languages of the common people (languages other than Latin). This allowed more people to read and learn from the scripture, leading to the [[Evangelism|Evangelical movement]]. The people who spread this message, concentrated more on [[Individualism|individual agency]] rather than the structures of the Church.&lt;ref name="Szalay2016" /&gt;

== Perspectives ==
[[File:Dawkins aaconf.jpg|thumb|According to [[Richard Dawkins]], "Not only is science corrosive to religion; religion is corrosive to science. It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial, supernatural non-explanations and blinds them to the wonderful real explanations that we have within our grasp. It teaches them to accept authority, revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism?language=en Richard Dawkins on militant atheism] ([http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism/transcript?language=en transcript]), [[TED talk]], 2007 (page visited on 21 January 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The kinds of interactions that might arise between science and religion have been categorized by theologian, Anglican priest, and physicist [[John Polkinghorne]]: (1) conflict between the disciplines, (2) independence of the disciplines, (3) dialogue between the disciplines where they overlap and (4) integration of both into one field.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Polkinghorne]] ''Science and Theology'' SPCK/Fortress Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8006-3153-6}} pp. 20–22, following [[Ian Barbour]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This typology is similar to ones used by theologians [[Ian Barbour]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4aUPT8fmrbYC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;vq=typology&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U24Iyg68UM2bEY8idn4TyMV4ViJtw Nature, Human Nature, and God], [[Ian G.

=== Incompatibility ===
According to Guillermo Paz-y-Miño-C and Avelina Espinosa, the historical conflict between evolution and religion is intrinsic to the incompatibility between [[scientific]] [[rationalism]]/[[empiricism]] and the belief in [[supernatural]] causation.&lt;ref name=IH&gt;{{cite web|title= The Incompatibility Hypothesis: Evolution versus Supernatural Causation|url=http://faculty.rwu.edu/aespinosa/aespinosa/Publications_files/Incompatibility_Hypothesis_Evolution_SpCausation_Paz-y-MinoC_Espinosa_2014.pdf|publisher=In Why Does Evolution Matter?

[[Planetary scientist]] [[Carolyn Porco]] describes a hope that "the confrontation between science and formal religion will come to an end when the role played by science in the lives of all people is the same played by religion today."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11273&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Geologist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Donald Prothero]] has stated that religion is the reason "questions about [[evolution]], the age of the earth, cosmology, and human evolution nearly always cause Americans to flunk science literacy tests compared to other nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticblog.org/2013/09/25/losing-our-religion/|website=Skepticblog|first=Donald|last=Prothero|date=25 September 2013|title=Losing our religion|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jon Miller, who studies science literacy across nations, states that Americans in general are slightly more scientifically literate than Europeans and the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientific Literacy: How Do Americans Stack Up? |website=Michigan State University |publisher=Science Daily |date=February 27, 2007 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070218134322.htm |quote="A slightly higher proportion of American adults qualify as scientifically literate than European or Japanese adults, but the truth is that no major industrial nation in the world today has a sufficient number of scientifically literate adults."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[cosmologist]] and [[theoretical physicist]] [[Lawrence Krauss]], compatibility or incompatibility is a theological concern, not a scientific concern.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt;  In [[Lisa Randall]]'s view, questions of incompatibility or otherwise are not answerable, since by accepting revelations one is abandoning rules of logic which are needed to identify if there are indeed contradictions between holding certain beliefs.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] holds that incompatibility exists because religion is not problematic to a certain point before it collapses into a number of excuses for keeping certain beliefs, in light of evolutionary implications.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt;

According to [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], the central difference between the nature of science and religion is that the claims of science rely on experimental verification, while the claims of religions rely on faith, and these are irreconcilable approaches to knowing. Because of this both are incompatible as currently practiced and the debate of compatibility or incompatibility will be eternal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1999/10/01/holy-wars |title=Holy Wars|author= Neil deGrasse Tyson |publisher=Haydenplanetarium.org |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson From Natural History Magazine, October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher and physicist [[Victor J. Stenger]]'s view is that science and religion are incompatible due to conflicts between approaches of knowing and the availability of alternative plausible natural explanations for phenomena that is usually explained in religious contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stenger|first=Victor J. | authorlink=Victor_J._Stenger | title=God and the folly of faith : the incompatibility of science and religion|publisher=Prometheus Books|pages=290–96 |location=Amherst, N.Y.|isbn=1-61614-599-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sean M. Carroll]], since religion makes claims that are not compatible with science, such as supernatural events, therefore both are incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean|title=Science and Religion are Not Compatible|url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2009/06/23/science-and-religion-are-not-compatible|website=Sean Carroll Blog|date=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]] is openly hostile to fundamentalist religion because it actively debauches the scientific enterprise and education involving science. According to Dawkins, religion "subverts science and saps the intellect".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], ''[[The God Delusion]]'', Bantam Press, 2006, pp. 282–86.&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that when science teachers attempt to expound on evolution, there is hostility aimed towards them by parents who are skeptical because they believe it conflicts with their own religious beliefs, and that even in some textbooks have had the word 'evolution' systematically removed.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins, ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution]]'', Free Press, 2010, pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked to argue the negative effects that he believes religion has on education of science.

====Criticism====

Others such as [[Francis Collins]], [[George F. R. Ellis]],
[[Kenneth R. Miller]], [[Katharine Hayhoe]], [[George Coyne]] and [[Simon Conway Morris]] argue for compatibility since they do not agree that science is incompatible with religion and vice versa. They argue that science provides many opportunities to look for and find God in nature and to reflect on their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Excerpts of Statements by Scientists Who See No Conflict Between Their Faith and Science|url=http://www.nas.edu/evolution/StatementsScience.html|publisher=National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kenneth Miller, he disagrees with Jerry Coyne's assessment and argues that since significant portions of scientists are religious and the proportion of Americans believing in evolution is much higher, it implies that both are indeed compatible.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt; Elsewhere, Miller has argued that when scientists make claims on science and theism or atheism, they are not arguing scientifically at all and are stepping beyond the scope of science into discourses of meaning and purpose. What he finds particularly odd and unjustified is in how atheists often come to invoke scientific authority on their non-scientific philosophical conclusions like there being no point or no meaning to the universe as the only viable option when the scientific method and science never have had any way of addressing questions of meaning or God in the first place. Furthermore, he notes that since evolution made the brain and since the brain can handle both religion and science, there is no natural incompatibility between the concepts at the biological level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Kenneth R.|title=Finding Darwin's God: A Scientist's Search for Common Ground Between God and Evolution|date=1999|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-093049-3|pages=284–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Giberson argues that when discussing compatibility, some scientific intellectuals often ignore the viewpoints of intellectual leaders in theology and instead argue against less informed masses, thereby, defining religion by non intellectuals and slanting the debate unjustly. He argues that leaders in science sometimes trump older scientific baggage and that leaders in theology do the same, so once theological intellectuals are taken into account, people who represent extreme positions like Ken Ham and Eugenie Scott will become irrelevant.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt; Cynthia Tolman notes that religion does not have a method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures, but when it comes to Christian theology and ultimate truths, she notes that people often rely on scripture, tradition, reason, and experience to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tolman|first1=Cynthia|title=Methods in Religion|url=http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html|website=Malboro College|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904013431/http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html|archivedate=2015-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Conflict thesis ====
{{Main|Conflict thesis}}
The [[conflict thesis]], which holds that religion and science have been in conflict continuously throughout history, was popularized in the 19th century by [[John William Draper]]'s and [[Andrew Dickson White]]'s accounts. It was in the 19th century that relationship between science and religion became an actual formal topic of discourse, while before this no one had pitted science against religion or vice versa, though occasional complex interactions had been expressed before the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Galileo Goes To Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|year=2009|isbn=978-0-674-05741-8|page=3|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most contemporary historians of science now reject the conflict thesis in its original form and no longer support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ferngren, G.B.|editor=Ferngren, G.B.|year=2002|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|page=x|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|isbn=0-8018-7038-0|quote=... while [John] Brooke's view [of a complexity thesis rather than an historical conflict thesis] has gained widespread acceptance among professional historians of science, the traditional view remains strong elsewhere, not least in the popular mind.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scientists religion" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

(p. 7, followed by a list of the basic reasons why the conflict thesis is wrong).&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of science, Gary Ferngren, has stated "Although popular images of controversy continue to exemplify the supposed hostility of Christianity to new scientific theories, studies have shown that Christianity has often nurtured and encouraged scientific endeavour, while at other times the two have co-existed without either tension or attempts at harmonization. If Galileo and the Scopes trial come to mind as examples of conflict, they were the exceptions rather than the rule."&lt;ref&gt;Gary Ferngren (editor). ''Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-8018-7038-0}}. (Introduction, p. ix)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians today have moved away from a conflict model, which is based mainly on two historical episodes (Galileo and Darwin) for a "complexity" model, because religious figures were on both sides of each dispute and there was no overall aim by any party involved to discredit religion.&lt;ref name="glory rich jones"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Richard H.|title=For the Glory of God : The Role of Christianity in the Rise and Development of Modern Science Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-5566-8|pages=19–22, 139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An often cited example of conflict, that has been clarified by historical research in the 20th century, was the Galileo affair, whereby interpretations of the Bible were used to attack ideas by [[Copernicus]] on [[heliocentrism]]. By 1616 [[Galileo]] went to Rome to try to persuade Catholic Church authorities not to ban Copernicus' ideas. In the end, a decree of the Congregation of the Index was issued, declaring that the ideas that the Sun stood still and that the Earth moved were "false" and "altogether contrary to Holy Scripture", and suspending Copernicus's ''[[De Revolutionibus]]'' until it could be corrected. Galileo was found "vehemently suspect of heresy", namely of having held the opinions that the Sun lies motionless at the center of the universe, that the Earth is not at its centre and moves. He was required to "abjure, curse and detest" those opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Fantoli (2005, p. 139), Finocchiaro (1989, pp. 288–93).&lt;/ref&gt; However, before all this, Pope Urban VIII had personally asked Galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in a book, and to be careful not to advocate heliocentrism as physically proven since the scientific consensus at the time was that the evidence for heliocentrism was very weak. The Church had merely sided with the scientific consensus of the time.  Pope Urban VIII asked that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter was fulfilled by Galileo. Whether unknowingly or deliberately, Simplicio, the defender of the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic geocentric view in ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'', was often portrayed as an unlearned fool who lacked mathematical training. Although the preface of his book claims that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher ([[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] in Latin, Simplicio in Italian), the name "Simplicio" in Italian also has the connotation of "simpleton".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Li4eh7JIMtIC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82]; [[#Reference-Moss&amp;Wallace-2003|Moss &amp; Wallace (2003)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&amp;pg=PA11 p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for his relationship with the Pope, Galileo put the words of Urban VIII into the mouth of Simplicio. Most historians agree Galileo did not act out of malice and felt blindsided by the reaction to his book.&lt;ref&gt;See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966, pp. 133–34)]], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966, p. 30)]], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978, p. 355)]] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers, Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], rather than Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p. 491)]]. Even [[Arthur Koestler]], who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in ''[[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler non-fiction book)|The Sleepwalkers]]'' [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959)]], after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of having intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says "this of course is untrue" [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959, p. 483)]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Pope did not take the suspected public ridicule lightly, nor the physical Copernican advocacy. Galileo had alienated one of his biggest and most powerful supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Beyond War and Peace:  A Reappraisal of the Encounter between Christianity and Science|url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1987/PSCF9-87Lindberg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual evidences that finally proved heliocentrism came centuries after Galileo: the stellar aberration of light by James Bradley in the 18th century, the orbital motions of binary stars by William Herschel in the 19th century,  the accurate measurement of the stellar parallax in the 19th century, and Newtonian mechanics in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Biékowska|editor1-first=Barbara|title=Scientific World of Copernicus: On the Occasion of the 500th Anniversary of his Birth 1473–1973.|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9401026181|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did Galileo have Proof of the Earth's Movement?|url=http://muse.tau.ac.il/museum/galileo/did_galileo.html|publisher=Tel-Aviv University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to physicist Christopher Graney, Galileo's own observations did not actually support the Copernican view, but were more consistent with Tycho Brahe's hybrid model where that Earth did not move and everything else circled around it and the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanderson|first1=Katharine|title=Galileo backed Copernicus despite data: Stars viewed through early telescopes suggested that Earth stood still|journal=Nature|date=5 March 2010|doi=10.1038/news.2010.105|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100305/full/news.2010.105.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British philosopher [[A. C. Grayling]], still believes there is competition between science and religions and point to the origin of the universe, the nature of human beings and the possibility of miracles{{sfn|Grayling|2014|p=55|ps=:''"In fact religion and science are competitors for the truth about quite a number of things, including the origins of the universe, the nature of human beings, and the belief that the laws of nature can be locally and temporarily suspended- thus allowing for miracle"''}}

=== Independence ===

A modern view, described by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] as "[[non-overlapping magisteria]]" (NOMA), is that science and religion deal with fundamentally separate aspects of human experience and so, when each stays within its own domain, they co-exist peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould]]. ''[[Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life]]''. Ballantine Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; While Gould spoke of independence from the perspective of science, [[W. T. Stace]] viewed independence from the perspective of the [[philosophy of religion]]. Stace felt that science and religion, when each is viewed in its own domain, are both consistent and complete.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. T. Stace]], ''[[Time and Eternity: an Essay in the Philosophy of Religion]]'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, NJ, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

The USA's [[National Academy of Science]] supports the view that science and religion are independent.&lt;ref name="nas.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.edu/evolution/Compatibility.html|title=Evolution Resources: Compatibility of Science and Religion |publisher=[[National Academies of the United States]]|work= [[Science, Evolution, and Creationism]]|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Science and religion are based on different aspects of human experience. In science, explanations must be based on evidence drawn from examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or experiments that conflict with an explanation eventually must lead to modification or even abandonment of that explanation. Religious faith, in contrast, does not depend on empirical evidence, is not necessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and typically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are not a part of nature, supernatural entities cannot be investigated by science. In this sense, science and religion are separate and address aspects of human understanding in different ways. Attempts to put science and religion against each other create controversy where none needs to exist.&lt;ref name="nas.edu" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Archbishop [[John Habgood, Baron Habgood|John Habgood]], both science and religion represent distinct ways of approaching experience and these differences are sources of debate. He views science as [[Positive science|descriptive]] and religion as [[Normative|prescriptive]]. He stated that if science and mathematics concentrate on what the world ''ought to be'', in the way that religion does, it may lead to improperly ascribing properties to the natural world as happened among the followers of [[Pythagoras]] in the sixth century B.C.&lt;ref name=habgood&gt;''Religion and Science'', [[John Habgood]], Mills &amp; Brown, 1964, pp. 11, 14–16, 48–55, 68–69, 87, 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, proponents of a [[science of morality|normative moral science]] take issue with the idea that science has ''no'' way of guiding "oughts". Habgood also stated that he believed that the reverse situation, where religion attempts to be descriptive, can also lead to inappropriately assigning properties to the natural world. A notable example is the now defunct belief in the [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] (geocentric) planetary model that held sway until changes in scientific and religious thinking were brought about by [[Galileo]] and proponents of his views.&lt;ref name=habgood /&gt;

==== Parallels in method ====
According to [[Ian Barbour]], [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] asserted that science is made up of [[paradigms]] that arise from cultural traditions, which is similar to the secular perspective on religion.&lt;ref name=Barbour1968&gt;{{cite book|last=Barbour|first=Ian G.|authorlink=Ian Barbour|editor=Ian G. Barbour (ed.)|title=Science and Religion: New Perspectives on the Dialogue|edition=1st|year=1968|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]]|location=New York, Evanston and London|pages=3–29|chapter=Science and Religion Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Polanyi]] asserted that it is merely a commitment to [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] that protects against [[subjectivity]] and has nothing at all to do with personal detachment as found in many conceptions of the scientific method. Polanyi further asserted that all knowledge is personal and therefore the scientist must be performing a very personal if not necessarily subjective role when doing science.&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Polanyi added that the scientist often merely follows intuitions of "intellectual beauty, symmetry, and 'empirical agreement'".&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Polanyi held that science requires moral commitments similar to those found in religion.&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt;

Two physicists, [[Charles A. Coulson]] and [[Harold K. Schilling]], both claimed that "the methods of science and religion have much in common."&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Schilling asserted that both fields—science and religion—have "a threefold structure—of experience, theoretical interpretation, and practical application."&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Coulson asserted that science, like religion, "advances by creative imagination" and not by "mere collecting of facts," while stating that religion should and does "involve critical reflection on experience not unlike that which goes on in science."&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Religious language and scientific language also show parallels (cf. [[rhetoric of science]]).

Philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] has argued that there is superficial conflict but deep concord between science and religion, and that there is deep conflict between science and [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stanford.library.usyd.edu.au/entries/religion-science/ Science and Religion], by Alvin Plantinga, 2007, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga, in his book ''Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism'', heavily contests the linkage of naturalism with science, as conceived by Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett and like-minded thinkers; while Daniel Dennett thinks that Plantinga stretches science to an unacceptable extent.&lt;ref name=schuessler&gt;{{cite news|last=Schuessler|first=Jennifer|title=Philosopher sticks up for God|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/14/books/alvin-plantingas-new-book-on-god-and-science.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Maarten Boudry]], in reviewing the book, has commented that he resorts to [[creationism]] and fails to "stave off the conflict between theism and evolution."&lt;ref name=boudry&gt;{{cite journal|first=Maarten|last=Boudry|authorlink=Maarten Boudry|magazine=International History, Philosophy and Science Teaching Group|date=September 2012|title=Review of Alvin Plantinga (2011), Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion and Naturalism|quote=Plantinga's effort to stave off the conflict between theism and evolution is a failure... if the bar for rational belief is lowered to mere logical possibility, and the demand for positive evidence dropped, then no holds are barred.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive scientist [[Justin L.

=== Integration ===
As a general view, this holds that while interactions are complex between influences of science, theology, politics, social, and economic concerns, the productive engagements between science and religion throughout history should be duly stressed as the norm.

Scientific and theological perspectives often coexist peacefully. Christians and some non-Christian religions have historically integrated well with scientific ideas, as in the [[ancient Egypt]]ian technological mastery applied to [[monotheistic]] ends, the flourishing of [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] under [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], and the scientific advances made by [[Islam|Muslim]] scholars during the [[Ottoman empire]]. Even many 19th-century Christian communities welcomed scientists who claimed that science was not at all concerned with discovering the ultimate nature of reality.&lt;ref name="habgood" /&gt; According to [[Lawrence M. Principe]], the [[Johns Hopkins University]] Drew Professor of the Humanities, from a historical perspective this points out that much of the current-day clashes occur between limited extremists—both religious and scientistic fundamentalists—over a very few topics, and that the movement of ideas back and forth between scientific and theological thought has been more usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |title = Science and Religion
 |publisher = The Teaching Company
 |last = Principe

Religions have also given key participation in development of modern [[universities]] and libraries; centers of learning &amp; scholarship were coincident with religious institutions – whether pagan, Muslim, or Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A fundamental principle of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] is the harmony of religion and science.  [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í scripture]] asserts that true [[science]] and true [[religion]] can never be in conflict. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, stated that religion without science is superstition and that science without religion is materialism. He also admonished that true religion must conform to the conclusions of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hatcher | first = William | title = Science and the Bahá'í Faith | journal = [[Zygon (journal)|Zygon]] | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 229–53 |date=September 1979 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9744.1979.tb00359.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Smith |first = P. |year = 1999 |title = A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher = Oneworld Publications |location = Oxford, UK |pages = 306–07 |isbn = 1-85168-184-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jbs"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mehanian | first = Courosh |author2=Friberg, Stephen R.  | year = 2003 | title = Religion and Evolution Reconciled: 'Abdu'l-Bahá's Comments on Evolution | journal = The Journal of Bahá'í studies | volume = 13 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 55–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buddhism ==
{{Main|Buddhism and science}}
[[Buddhism]] and science have been regarded as compatible by numerous authors.&lt;ref&gt;Yong, Amos. (2005) ''Buddhism and Science: Breaking New Ground (review)'' Buddhist-Christian Studies – Volume 25, 2005, pp. 176–80&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophic and psychological teachings found in Buddhism share points in common with [[Enlightenment (philosophy)|modern Western scientific and philosophic thought]]. For example, Buddhism encourages the impartial investigation of nature (an activity referred to as ''[[Dhamma vicaya|Dhamma-Vicaya]]'' in the [[Pali Canon]])—the principal object of study being oneself.  Buddhism and science both show a strong emphasis on [[causality]]. However, Buddhism doesn't focus on [[materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, B. Alan. (2003). ''Buddhism &amp; science: breaking new ground''. Columbia University Press, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tenzin Gyatso]], the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], maintains that empirical scientific evidence supersedes the traditional teachings of [[Buddhism]] when the two are in conflict. In his book ''The Universe in a Single Atom'' he wrote,  "My confidence in venturing into science lies in my basic belief that as in science, so in Buddhism, understanding the nature of reality is pursued by means of critical investigation." and "If scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false," he says, "then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Jon.

Among early Christian teachers, [[Tertullian]] (c. 160–220) held a generally negative opinion of [[Greek philosophy]], while [[Origen]] (c. 185–254) regarded it much more favorably and required his students to read nearly every work available to them.&lt;ref name="Davis2003"&gt;{{cite book | last = Davis | first = Edward B. | contribution = Christianity, History Of Science And Religion | year = 2003 | title = Encyclopedia of Science and Religion | editor-last = Van Huyssteen | editor-first = Wentzel | volume =  | pages = 123–27 | place = | publisher = Macmillan Reference  | isbn=978-0-02-865704-2 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Earlier attempts at reconciliation of Christianity with [[Newtonian mechanics]] appear quite different from later attempts at reconciliation with the newer scientific ideas of [[evolution]] or [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].&lt;ref name=habgood /&gt; &lt;!-- Habgood: pages 48-55 --&gt; Many early interpretations of evolution polarized themselves around a ''[[survival of the fittest|struggle for existence]].'' These ideas were significantly countered by later findings of universal [[sociobiology|patterns of biological cooperation]]. According to [[John Habgood]], all man really knows here is that the [[universe]] seems to be a mix of [[good and evil]], [[beauty]] and [[pain]], and that [[suffering]] may somehow be part of the process of creation. Habgood holds that Christians should not be surprised that suffering may be used creatively by [[God]], given their faith in the symbol of the [[Christian cross|Cross]].&lt;ref name=habgood /&gt; &lt;!-- Habgood: page 68-69 --&gt;

Modern historians of science such as [[J.L.

In their views, not only did the monks save and cultivate the remnants of ancient civilization during the barbarian invasions, but the medieval church promoted learning and science through its sponsorship of many [[universities]] which, under its leadership, grew rapidly in Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries, St. Thomas Aquinas, the Church's "model theologian", not only argued that reason is in harmony with faith, he even recognized that reason can contribute to understanding revelation, and so encouraged intellectual development. He was not unlike other medieval theologians who sought out reason in the effort to defend his faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fides et Ratio (Faith and Reason), IV |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/JP2FIDES.HTM#Ch4b |author=Pope John Paul II |date=September 1998 |accessdate=2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of today's scholars, such as [[Stanley Jaki]], have claimed that Christianity with its particular [[worldview]], was a crucial factor for the emergence of modern science.&lt;ref&gt;Jaki, Stanley L. The Savior of Science, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company (July 2000), {{ISBN|0-8028-4772-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

David C. Lindberg states that the widespread popular belief that the Middle Ages was a time of ignorance and superstition due to the Christian church is a "caricature". According to Lindberg, while there are some portions of the classical tradition which suggest this view, these were exceptional cases. It was common to tolerate and encourage critical thinking about the nature of the world. The relation between Christianity and science is complex and cannot be simplified to either harmony or conflict, according to Lindberg.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, "The Medieval Church Encounters the Classical Tradition: Saint Augustine, Roger Bacon, and the Handmaiden Metaphor", in David C. Lindberg and Ronald L. Numbers, ed. ''When Science &amp; Christianity Meet'', (Chicago: University of Chicago Pr., 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Lindberg reports that "the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led. There was no warfare between science and the church."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in: Peters, Ted. "Science and Religion". ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' p. 8182&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ted Peters (theologian)|Ted Peters]] in ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' writes that although there is some truth in the "Galileo's condemnation" story but through exaggerations, it has now become "a modern myth perpetuated by those wishing to see warfare between science and religion who were allegedly persecuted by an atavistic and dogma-bound ecclesiastical authority".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Ted Peters, Science and Religion, Encyclopedia of Religion, p. 8182&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the [[Catholic Church]]'s seeming vindication of Galileo attracted much comment in the [[Galileo affair|media]].

A degree of concord between science and religion can be seen in religious belief and empirical science. The belief that God created the world and therefore humans, can lead to the view that he arranged for humans to know the world. This is underwritten by the doctrine of [[imago dei]]. In the words of [[Thomas Aquinas]], "Since human beings are said to be in the image of God in virtue of their having a nature that includes an intellect, such a nature is most in the image of God in virtue of being most able to imitate God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-science/#Con |title=Religion and Science (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a period "characterized by dramatic revolutions in science" and the rise of Protestant challenges to the authority of the Catholic Church via individual liberty, the authority of Christian scriptures became strongly challenged.

In recent history, the theory of [[evolution]] has been at the center of some controversy between Christianity and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| first1=Jeffrey P. |last1=Schloss | contribution = Evolutionary theory and religious belief| editor-first1 = Philip |editor-last1 = Clayton | editor-first2 = Zachary |editor-last2= Simpson | title = The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science| pages = 187–206| publisher = Oxford University Press| place = Oxford| year = 2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Religion_and_Scie.html?id=7_Ba1sm0jP4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians who accept a literal interpretation of the [[biblical creation|biblical account of creation]] find incompatibility between [[Darwinian evolution]] and their interpretation of the Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-science/#Sci|title=Religion and Science|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creation science]] or [[scientific creationism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GQ3TI5njXfIC&amp;pg=PA268 268–285]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a branch of [[creationism]] that attempts to provide scientific support for the [[Genesis creation narrative]] in the [[Book of Genesis]] and attempts to disprove generally accepted [[scientific fact]]s, [[Scientific theory|theories]] and [[Paradigm|scientific paradigms]] about the geological history of the Earth, [[cosmology]] of the early universe,

Later that year, a similar law was passed in Mississippi, and likewise, Arkansas in 1927. In 1968, these "anti-monkey" laws were struck down by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] as unconstitutional, "because they established a religious doctrine violating both the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendments]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;The Origin of Rights, Roger E.

Most scientists have rejected creation science for several reasons, including that its claims do not refer to natural causes and cannot be tested. In 1987, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled that creationism is [[religion]], not science, and cannot be advocated in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;The legislative history demonstrates that the term "creation science," as contemplated by the state legislature, embraces this religious teaching.&lt;/cite&gt;" [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0482_0578_ZS.html Edwards v.

[[Theistic evolution]] attempts to reconcile Christian beliefs and science by accepting the scientific understanding of the age of the Earth and the process of evolution. It includes a range of beliefs, including views described as [[old earth creationism|evolutionary creationism]], which accepts some findings of modern science but also upholds classical religious teachings about God and creation in Christian context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Francis S.|title=The Language of God : A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief|year=2007|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=1-4165-4274-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reconciliation in Britain in the early 20th century ===
In ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-twentieth-century Britain'', historian of biology [[Peter J. Bowler]] argues that in contrast to the conflicts between science and religion in the U.S. in the 1920s (most famously the [[Scopes Trial]]), during this period Great Britain experienced a concerted effort at reconciliation, championed by intellectually conservative scientists, supported by liberal theologians but opposed by younger scientists and secularists and [[British Conservative Evangelicalism|conservative Christians]]. These attempts at reconciliation fell apart in the 1930s due to increased social tensions, moves towards [[neo-orthodox]] theology and the acceptance of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-twentieth-century Britain'', [[Peter J. Bowler]], 2001, [[University of Chicago Press]], {{ISBN|0-226-06858-7}}. Front dustcover flap material&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, several [[ecumenical]] organizations promoting a harmony between science and Christianity were founded, most notably the [[American Scientific Affiliation]], [[Biologos Foundation|The Biologos Foundation]], [[Christians in Science]], [[Society of Ordained Scientists|The Society of Ordained Scientists]], and [[Veritas Forum|The Veritas Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James C. Peterson|title=Genetic Turning Points: The Ethics of Human Genetic Intervention|year=2001|publisher=[[Wm. B.

It currently has about two thousand members, all of whom affirm the Apostles' Creed as part of joining the association, and most of whom hold Ph.D.s in the natural sciences. Their active journal is ''[[Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith]]''. Across the Atlantic, the Society of Ordained Scientists and Christians in Science are similar affiliation in Great Britain.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman Catholicism ===
{{See also|Catholic Church and evolution|Catholic Church and science}}

While refined and clarified over the centuries, the [[Roman Catholic]] position on the relationship between science and religion is one of harmony, and has maintained the teaching of [[natural law]] as set forth by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. For example, regarding scientific study such as that of evolution, the church's unofficial position is an example of [[theistic evolution]], stating that faith and scientific findings regarding human evolution are not in conflict, though humans are regarded as a special creation, and that the existence of God is required to explain both [[monogenism]] and the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] component of human origins. Catholic schools have included all manners of scientific study in their curriculum for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13554b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=New Advent |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo once stated "The intention of the [[Holy Spirit]] is to teach us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Cambridge Companion to Galileo|last= Machamer|first= Peter|year= 1998|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|location= |isbn= 0-521-58841-3|page= 306}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981  [[John Paul II]], then [[pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], spoke of the relationship this way: "The Bible itself speaks to us of the origin of the universe and its make-up, not in order to provide us with a scientific treatise, but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe. Sacred Scripture wishes simply to declare that the world was created by God, and in order to teach this truth it expresses itself in the terms of the cosmology in use at the time of the writer".&lt;ref&gt;Pope [[John Paul II]], 3 October 1981 to the Pontifical Academy of Science, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2COSM.HTM "Cosmology and Fundamental Physics"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence of a biblical world view on early modern science ===
[[File:Gossuin de Metz - L'image du monde - BNF Fr. 574 fo42 - miniature.jpg|thumb|Medieval artistic illustration of the [[spherical Earth]] in a 13th-century copy of ''[[Gautier de Metz|L'Image du monde]]'' (c. 1246)]]
According to [[Andrew Dickson White]]'s ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'' from the 19th century, a biblical world view affected negatively the progress of science through time. Dickinson also argues that immediately following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] matters were even worse. The interpretations of Scripture by Luther and Calvin became as sacred to their followers as the Scripture itself. For instance, when [[Georg Calixtus]] ventured, in interpreting the Psalms, to question the accepted belief that "the waters above the heavens" were contained in a vast receptacle upheld by a solid vault, he was bitterly denounced as heretical.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dickson White. ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'' (Kindle Locations 1970–2132)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, much of the scholarship in which the conflict thesis was originally based is considered to be inaccurate. For instance, the claim that early Christians rejected scientific findings by the Greco-Romans is false, since the "handmaiden" view of secular studies was seen to shed light on theology.  This view was widely adapted throughout the early medieval period and afterwards by theologians (such as Augustine) and ultimately resulted in fostering interest in knowledge about nature through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|chapter=Myth 1: That the Rise of Christianity was Responsible for the Demise of Ancient Science|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05741-8|pages=15–18|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the claim that people of the [[Middle Ages]] widely believed that the [[Flat Earth|Earth was flat]] was first propagated in the same period that originated the conflict thesis&lt;ref name="flat"&gt;Jeffrey Russell. ''Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians''. Praeger Paperback; New Edition (January 30, 1997). {{ISBN|0-275-95904-X}}; {{ISBN|978-0-275-95904-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is still very common in popular culture. Modern scholars regard this claim as mistaken, as the contemporary historians of science [[David C. Lindberg]] and [[Ronald L. Numbers]] write: "there was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference."&lt;ref name="flat" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from [[David C.

Studies in the History of Science and Christianity.&lt;/ref&gt; From the fall of Rome to the time of Columbus, all major scholars and many vernacular writers interested in the physical shape of the earth held a spherical view with the exception of Lactantius and Cosmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cormack|first=Leslie|title=Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|chapter=Myth 3: That Medieval Christians Taught that the Earth was Flat|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05741-8|pages=28–34|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. Floris Cohen]] argued for a biblical Protestant, but not excluding Catholicism, influence on the early development of modern science.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wu8b2NAqnb0C ''The Scientific Revolution: A Historiographical Inquiry''], [[H. Floris Cohen]], University of Chicago Press 1994, 680 pages, {{ISBN|0-226-11280-2}}, pp. 308–21&lt;/ref&gt; He presented Dutch historian [[Reijer Hooykaas|R. Hooykaas]]' argument that a biblical world-view holds all the necessary antidotes for the hubris of Greek rationalism: a respect for manual labour, leading to more experimentation and [[empiricism]], and a supreme God that left nature open to emulation and manipulation.&lt;ref name=cohen /&gt; It supports the idea early modern science rose due to a combination of Greek and biblical thought.&lt;ref&gt;"Finally, and most importantly, Hooykaas does not of course claim that the Scientific Revolution was exclusively the work of Protestant scholars."  Cohen (1994) p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (1994) p. 313. Hooykaas puts it more poetically: "Metaphorically speaking, whereas the bodily ingredients of science may have been Greek, its vitamins and hormones were biblical."&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford historian [[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]] is another who has argued that a biblical worldview was significant for the development of modern science.  Harrison contends that Protestant approaches to the book of scripture had significant, if largely unintended, consequences for the interpretation of the book of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison, ''The Bible, Protestantism, and the Rise of Natural Science'' (Cambridge, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; {{Page needed|date=July 2013}}  Harrison has also suggested that literal readings of the Genesis narratives of the Creation and Fall motivated and legitimated scientific activity in seventeenth-century England.  For many of its seventeenth-century practitioners, science was imagined to be a means of restoring a human dominion over nature that had been lost as a consequence of the Fall.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison, ''The Fall of Man and the Foundations of Science'' (Cambridge, 2007); see also Charles Webster, ''The Great Instauration'' (London: Duckworth, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}

Historian and professor of religion [[Eugene Marion Klaaren|Eugene M. Klaaren]] holds that "a belief in divine creation" was central to an emergence of science in seventeenth-century England. The philosopher [[Michael Foster (philosopher)|Michael Foster]] has published analytical philosophy connecting Christian doctrines of creation with empiricism. Historian William B. Ashworth has argued against the historical notion of distinctive mind-sets and the idea of Catholic and Protestant sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hs2edDIGCqEC|title=God and Nature|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians James R. Jacob and Margaret C. Jacob have argued for a linkage between seventeenth century [[Anglican]] intellectual transformations and influential English scientists (e.g., [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Isaac Newton]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compilerpress.atfreeweb.com/Anno%20Jacob%20&amp;%20Jacob%20Anglican%20Fdn%20of%20Modern%20Science.htm The Anglican Origins of Modern Science], [[Isis (journal)|Isis]], Volume 71, Issue 2, June 1980, 251–67; this is also noted on p. 366 of ''Science and Religion'', [[John Hedley Brooke]], 1991, [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dillenberger]] and [[Christopher B. Kaiser]] have written theological surveys, which also cover additional interactions occurring in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Dillenberger]], ''Protestant Thought and Natural Science'' ([[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher B. Kaiser]], ''Creation and the History of Science'' ([[Eerdmans]], 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher of Religion, Richard Jones, has written a philosophical critique of the "dependency thesis" which assumes that modern science emerged from Christian sources and doctrines. Though he acknowledges that modern science emerged in a religious framework, that Christianity greatly elevated the importance of science by sanctioning and religiously legitimizing it in the medieval period, and that Christianity created a favorable social context for it to grow;  he argues that direct Christian beliefs or doctrines were not primary sources of scientific pursuits by natural philosophers, nor was Christianity, in and of itself, exclusively or directly necessary in developing or practicing modern science.&lt;ref name="glory rich jones" /&gt;

[[Oxford University]] historian and theologian [[John Hedley Brooke]] wrote that "when natural philosophers referred to ''laws'' of nature, they were not glibly choosing that metaphor. Laws were the result of legislation by an intelligent deity. Thus the philosopher [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) insisted that he was discovering the "laws that God has put into nature." Later Newton would declare that the regulation of the solar system presupposed the "counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hedley Brooke]], ''Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives'', 1991, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-23961-3}}, p. 19.  See also Peter Harrison, "Newtonian Science, Miracles, and the Laws of Nature", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 56 (1995), 531–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Ronald L. Numbers]] stated that this thesis "received a boost" from mathematician and philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s ''Science and the Modern World'' (1925). Numbers has also argued, "Despite the manifest shortcomings of the claim that Christianity gave birth to science—most glaringly, it ignores or minimizes the contributions of ancient Greeks and medieval Muslims—it too, refuses to succumb to the death it deserves."&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Christianity in pulpit and pew'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, [[Ronald L. Numbers]], pp. 4, 138 n. 3 where Numbers specifically raises his concerns with regards to the works of [[Michael B. Foster]], [[Reijer Hooykaas]], [[Eugene M. Klaaren]], and [[Stanley L. Jaki]]&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist [[Rodney Stark]] of [[Baylor University]], argued in contrast that "Christian theology was essential for the rise of science."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Stark]], ''For the glory of God: how monotheism led to reformations, science, witch-hunts and the end of slavery'', 2003, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-11436-6}}, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestantism had an important influence on science. According to the [[Merton Thesis]] there was a  positive [[correlation]] between the rise of [[Puritanism]] and [[Protestant]] [[Pietism]] on the one hand and early [[experimental science]] on the other.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003&gt;[[Piotr Sztompka|Sztompka, Piotr]] (2003), "Robert King Merton", in [[George Ritzer|Ritzer, George]], ''[[The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists]]''. Malden, Massachusetts; Oxford: Blackwell, p. 13, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0595-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Merton Thesis has two separate parts: Firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental techniques and [[methodology]]; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century [[England]] and the religious [[demography]] of the [[Royal Society]] (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a [[correlation]] between Protestantism and the scientific values.&lt;ref name=gregory1998&gt;Gregory,  Andrew (1998), Handout for course 'The Scientific Revolution' at The Scientific Revolution&lt;/ref&gt; In his theory, [[Robert K. Merton]] focused on English Puritanism and [[Spener|German Pietism]] as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries. Merton explained that the connection between [[religious affiliation]] and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the [[ascetic]] Protestant values and those of modern science.&lt;ref name=becker1992&gt;Becker, George (1992), ''The Merton Thesis: Oetinger and German Pietism, a significant negative case,'' [[Sociological Forum]] (Springer) 7 (4), pp. 642–60&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to study [[God]]'s influence on the world and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003 /&gt;

== Confucianism and traditional Chinese religion ==
The historical process of Confucianism has largely been antipathic towards scientific discovery. However the religio-philosophical system itself is more neutral on the subject than such an analysis might suggest. In his writings On Heaven, [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] espoused a proto-scientific world view.&lt;ref&gt;Cua, Antonio S. "The Quasi-Empirical Aspect of Hsün-tzu's Philosophy of Human Nature." PEW 28 (1978), 3–19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the Han Synthesis the more anti-empirical [[Mencius]] was favored and combined with [[Daoist]] skepticism regarding the nature of reality. Likewise, during the Medieval period, [[Zhu Xi]] argued against technical investigation and specialization proposed by Chen Liang.&lt;ref&gt;Tillman, Hoyt Cleveland.  "Utilitarian Confucianism : Chʻen Liang'' challenge to Chu Hsi" Cambridge, Mass.: Council on East Asian Studies, Harvard University: Distributed by Harvard University Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; After contact with the West, scholars such as [[Wang Fuzhi]] would rely on Buddhist/Daoist skepticism to denounce all science as a subjective pursuit limited by humanity's fundamental ignorance of the true nature of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Alison Harley. "Man and Nature in the Philosophical Thought of Wang Fu-Chih." Publications on Asia of the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies, University of Washington, no. 41. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[May Fourth Movement]], attempts to modernize Confucianism and reconcile it with scientific understanding were attempted by many scholars including [[Feng Youlan]] and [[Xiong Shili]]. Given the close relationship that Confucianism shares with Buddhism, many of the same arguments used to reconcile Buddhism with science also readily translate to Confucianism. However, modern scholars have also attempted to define the relationship between science and Confucianism on Confucianism's own terms and the results have usually led to the conclusion that Confucianism and science are fundamentally compatible.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Evelyn Tucker "Confucianism and Ecology: The Interrelation of Heaven, Earth, and Humans (Religions of the World and Ecology)" Center for the Study of World Religions (August 15, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], the dividing line between objective sciences and spiritual knowledge (''adhyatma vidya'') is a linguistic paradox.&lt;ref name="Mitcham"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics|author=Carl Mitcham|publisher=Macmillan Reference|year=2005|page=917|isbn=0-02-865831-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu scholastic activities and ancient Indian scientific advancements were so interconnected that many [[Hindu scriptures]] are also ancient scientific manuals and vice versa. In 1835, English was made the primary language for teaching in higher education in India, exposing Hindu scholars to Western secular ideas; this started [[Hindu Renaissance|a renaissance regarding religious and philosophical thought]].&lt;ref name="David Gosling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gosling|first=David L.|title=Darwin and the Hindu Tradition: "Does What Goes Around Come Around?"|journal=Zygon|year=2011|volume=46|issue=2|pages=345–69|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9744.2010.01177.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hindu sages maintained that logical argument and rational proof using [[Nyaya]] is the way to obtain correct knowledge.&lt;ref name="Mitcham" /&gt; The scientific level of understanding focuses on how things work and from where they originate, while Hinduism strives to understand the ultimate purposes for the existence of living things.&lt;ref name="David Gosling" /&gt; To obtain and broaden the knowledge of the world for spiritual perfection, many refer to the Bhāgavata for guidance because it draws upon a scientific and theological dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gosling|first1=David|title=Science and the Hindu Tradition: Compatibility or Conflict?|journal=Hinduism and Science: Contemporary Considerations|date=September 2012|volume=47|issue=3|pages=576–77|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.authenticate.library.duq.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=664a012b-631b-40dc-8433-ab92d3cc478f%40sessionmgr4004&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=4204|accessdate=2014-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hinduism offers methods to correct and transform itself in course of time. For instance, Hindu views on the development of life include a range of viewpoints in regards to [[evolution]], [[creationism]], and the [[origin of life]] within the traditions of [[Hinduism]]. For instance, it has been suggested that Wallace-Darwininan evolutionary thought was a part of Hindu thought centuries before modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=Sunil|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism (Volume 3)|year=1999|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=688|quote=The Hindus were Spinozaites more than two thousand years before the existence of Spinoza; and Darwinians many centuries before our time, and before any word like 'evolution' existed in any language of the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shankara and the Sāmkhya did not have a problem with the theory of evolution, but instead, argued about the existence of God and what happened after death. These two distinct groups argued among each other's philosophies because of their sacred texts, not the idea of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gosling|first1=David|title=Science and the Hindu Tradition: Compatibility or Conflict?|journal=Hinduism and Science: Contemporary Considerations|date=September 2012|volume=47|issue=3|page=577}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the publication of Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', many Hindus were eager to connect their scriptures to Darwinism, finding similarities between Brahma's creation, Vishnu's incarnations, and evolution theories.&lt;ref name="David Gosling" /&gt;

[[Samkhya]], the oldest school of [[Hindu philosophy]] prescribes a particular method to analyze knowledge. According to Samkhya, all knowledge is possible through three means of valid knowledge&lt;ref&gt;Sarma, Deepak (2011) "''Classical Indian Philosophy: A Reader''" p. 167 Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Samkhya Karika'', ''śloka''4&lt;/ref&gt; –
# ''Pratyakṣa'' or ''Dṛṣṭam'' – direct sense perception,
# ''Anumāna'' – [[logic]]al [[inference]] and
# ''Śabda'' or ''Āptavacana'' – verbal testimony.

[[Nyaya]], the Hindu school of logic, accepts all these 3 means and in addition accepts one more – ''[[Upamāna]]'' (comparison).

The accounts of the emergence of life within the universe vary in description, but classically the [[deity]] called [[Brahma]], from a [[Trimurti]] of three deities also including [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], is described as performing the act of 'creation', or more specifically of 'propagating life within the universe' with the other two deities being responsible for 'preservation' and 'destruction' (of the universe) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/beliefs/intro_1.shtml |title=Religion &amp; Ethics-Hinduism|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect some Hindu schools do not treat the scriptural [[Creation myth#Hindu|creation myth]] literally and often the creation stories themselves do not go into specific detail, thus leaving open the possibility of incorporating at least some theories in support of evolution. Some Hindus find support for, or foreshadowing of evolutionary ideas in [[Hindu scriptures|scriptures]], namely the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.well.com/user/jct/science.html | title=Science and spirituality: Any Points of Contact?

As per [[Vedas]], another explanation for the creation is based on the [[Mahābhūta|five elements]]: earth, water, fire, air and [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].
The Hindu religion traces its beginnings to the sacred Vedas. Everything that is established in the Hindu faith such as the gods and goddesses, doctrines, chants, spiritual insights, etc. flow from the poetry of [[Vedic hymns]]. The Vedas offer an honor to the sun and moon, water and wind, and to the order in Nature that is universal.

== Islam ==
{{Main|Islam and science}}
{{See also|Science in the medieval Islamic world}}

From an Islamic standpoint, science, the study of [[nature]], is considered to be linked to the concept of ''Tawhid'' (the Oneness of God), as are all other branches of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Muzaffar Iqbal 2007"&gt;Muzaffar Iqbal (2007). Science &amp; Islam. Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islam]], nature is not seen as a separate entity, but rather as an integral part of Islam's holistic outlook on God, humanity, and the world. The Islamic view of science and nature is continuous with that of religion and God. This link implies a sacred aspect to the pursuit of scientific knowledge by Muslims, as nature itself is viewed in the Qur'an as a compilation of signs pointing to the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;2. Toshihiko Izutsu (1964). God and Man in the Koran. Weltansckauung. Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt; It was with this understanding that science was studied and understood in Islamic civilizations, specifically during the eighth to sixteenth centuries, prior to the colonization of the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;3.	Situating Arabic Science: Locality versus Essence (A.I. Sabra)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Briffault]], in ''The Making of Humanity'', asserts that the very existence of science, as it is understood in the modern sense, is rooted in the scientific thought and knowledge that emerged in Islamic civilizations during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Briffault (1928).

With the decline of Islamic Civilizations in the late Middle Ages and the rise of Europe, the Islamic scientific tradition shifted into a new period. Institutions that had existed for centuries in the Muslim world looked to the new scientific institutions of European powers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  This changed the practice of science in the Muslim world, as Islamic scientists had to confront the western approach to scientific learning, which was based on a different philosophy of nature.&lt;ref name="Muzaffar Iqbal 2007" /&gt; From the time of this initial upheaval of the Islamic scientific tradition to the present day, Muslim scientists and scholars have developed a spectrum of viewpoints on the place of scientific learning within the context of Islam, none of which are universally accepted or practiced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Seyyid Hossein Nasr. "Islam and Modern Science"&lt;/ref&gt; However, most maintain the view that the acquisition of knowledge and scientific pursuit in general is not in disaccord with Islamic thought and religious belief.&lt;ref name="Muzaffar Iqbal 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

=== Ahmadiyya ===
{{Further|Ahmadiyya views on evolution}}
The [[Ahmadiyya]] movement emphasize that "there is no contradiction between [[Islam and science]]".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} For example, Ahmadi Muslims universally accept in principle the process of evolution, albeit divinely guided, and actively promote it. Over the course of several decades the movement has issued various publications in support of the scientific concepts behind the process of evolution, and frequently engages in promoting how religious scriptures, such as the Qur'an, supports the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html |title=Jesus and the Indian Messiah – 13.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Holy Quran]] directs attention towards science, time and again, rather than evoking prejudice against it. The Quran has never advised against studying science, lest the reader should become a non-believer; because it has no such fear or concern. The Holy Quran is not worried that if people will learn the laws of nature its spell will break. The Quran has not prevented people from science, rather it states, "Say, 'Reflect on what is happening in the heavens and the earth.'"

== Jainism ==
{{Main|Jainism and non-creationism}}
[[Jainism]] does not support belief in a [[creator deity]]. According to Jain doctrine, the [[universe]] and its constituents – soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion have always existed (a [[static universe]] similar to that of [[Epicureanism]] and [[Steady State theory|steady state cosmological model]]). All the constituents and actions are governed by [[Universal Law|universal]] [[natural laws]]. It is not possible to create matter out of nothing and hence the sum total of matter in the universe remains the same (similar to law of [[conservation of mass]]). Similarly, the [[soul]] of each living being is unique and uncreated and has existed since beginningless time.{{Ref label|A|a|none}}&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar (2005b), p. 190, Gāthā 10.310&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain theory of [[Causality|causation]] holds that a cause and its effect are always identical in nature and hence a conscious and immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Furthermore, according to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its karmas and desires, achieves liberation. A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the [[cosmos]]; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.

Through the ages, [[Jain Philosophy#Jain philosophers|Jain philosophers]] have adamantly rejected and opposed the concept of creator and omnipotent God and this has resulted in Jainism being labeled as ''[[Nastika|nastika darsana]]'' or [[Atheism|atheist philosophy]] by the rival [[Indian philosophy|religious philosophies]]. The theme of non-creationism and absence of omnipotent God and divine grace runs strongly in all the philosophical dimensions of Jainism, including its [[Jain cosmology|cosmology]], [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]] and its moral code of conduct. Jainism asserts a religious and virtuous life is possible without the idea of a creator god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Soni | first =Jayandra | editor =E.

== Perspectives from the scientific community ==

=== History ===
{{Further|List of Jewish scientists and philosophers|List of Christian thinkers in science|List of Muslim scientists|List of atheists (science and technology)|}}
In the 17th century, founders of the [[Royal Society]] largely held conventional and orthodox religious views, and a number of them were prominent Churchmen.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison, 'Religion, the Royal Society, and the Rise of Science', ''Theology and Science'', 6 (2008), 255–71.&lt;/ref&gt;  While theological issues that had the potential to be divisive were typically excluded from formal discussions of the early Society, many of its fellows nonetheless believed that their scientific activities provided support for traditional religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Sprat, ''The History of the Royal Society'' (London, 1667)&lt;/ref&gt;  Clerical involvement in the Royal Society remained high until the mid-nineteenth century, when science became more professionalised.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Turner, 'The Victorian Conflict between Science and Religion: A Professional Dimension', ''Isis'', 49 (1978) 356–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Einstein]] supported the compatibility of some interpretations of religion with science. In "Science, Philosophy and Religion, A Symposium" published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York in 1941, Einstein stated:
{{quotation|Accordingly, a religious person is devout in the sense that he has no doubt of the significance and loftiness of those superpersonal objects and goals which neither require nor are capable of rational foundation. They exist with the same necessity and matter-of-factness as he himself. In this sense religion is the age-old endeavor of mankind to become clearly and completely conscious of these values and goals and constantly to strengthen and extend their effect. If one conceives of religion and science according to these definitions then a conflict between them appears impossible. For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action: it cannot justifiably speak of facts and relationships between facts. According to this interpretation the well-known conflicts between religion and science in the past must all be ascribed to a misapprehension of the situation which has been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/aor/einstein/einsci.htm |title=Albert Einstein:Religion and Science |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Einstein thus expresses views of [[ethical non-naturalism]] (contrasted to [[ethical naturalism]]).

Prominent modern scientists who are [[Atheism|atheists]] include evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] and Nobel Prize–winning physicist [[Steven Weinberg]]. Prominent scientists advocating religious belief include Nobel Prize–winning physicist and [[United Church of Christ]] member [[Charles Townes]], evangelical Christian and past head of the [[Human Genome Project]] [[Francis Collins]], and climatologist [[John T. Houghton]].&lt;ref name=east1997 /&gt;

In 1916, 1,000 leading American scientists were randomly chosen from ''American Men of Science'' and 42% believed God existed, 42% disbelieved, and 17% had doubts/did not know; however when the study was replicated 80 years later using ''American Men and Women of Science'' in 1996, results were very much the same with 39% believing God exists, 45% disbelieved, and 15% had doubts/did not know.&lt;ref name="east1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson, E. J. 1997" /&gt; In the same 1996 survey, for scientists in the fields of biology, mathematics, and physics/astronomy, belief in a god that is "in intellectual and affective communication with humankind" was most popular among [[mathematician]]s (about 45%) and least popular among [[physicist]]s (about 22%). In total, in terms of belief toward a personal god and personal immortality, about 60% of [[United States]] scientists in these fields expressed either disbelief or agnosticism and about 40% expressed belief.&lt;ref name="Larson, E. J. 1997" /&gt; This compared with 62.9% in 1914 and 33% in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Edward J.|last2=Witham|first2=Larry|title=Leading scientists still reject God|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v394/n6691/full/394313a0.html#a1|website=Nature|accessdate=27 October 2017|pages=313–313|language=en|doi=10.1038/28478|date=23 July 1998|bibcode=1998Natur.394..313L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted between 2005 and 2007 by [[Elaine Howard Ecklund]] of [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]] of 1,646 natural and social science professors at 21 US research universities found that, in terms of belief in God or a higher power, more than 60% expressed either disbelief or agnosticism and more than 30% expressed belief. More specifically, nearly 34% answered "I do not believe in God" and about 30% answered "I do not know if there is a God and there is no way to find out."&lt;ref name="Ecklund study summary"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ecklund|first=Elaine|title=Religion and Spirituality among University Scientists|url=http://religion.ssrc.org/reforum/Ecklund.pdf|publisher=Social Science Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same study, 28% said they believed in God and 8% believed in a higher power that was not God.&lt;ref name="Ecklund scientists study"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ecklund|first=Elaine Howard|title=Science vs. Religion : What Scientists Really Think|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-539298-2|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecklund stated that scientists were often able to consider themselves spiritual without religion or belief in god.&lt;ref name=physorgeck&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.physorg.com/pdf5785.pdf|publisher=Physorg.com|title=Natural scientists are less likely to believe in God than are social scientists}} "Many scientists see themselves as having a spirituality not attached to a particular religious tradition. Some scientists who don't believe in God see themselves as very spiritual people. They have a way outside of themselves that they use to understand the meaning of life."&lt;/ref&gt; Ecklund and Scheitle concluded, from their study, that the individuals from non-religious backgrounds disproportionately had self-selected into scientific professions and that the assumption that becoming a scientist necessarily leads to loss of religion is untenable since the study did not strongly support the idea that scientists had dropped religious identities due to their scientific training.&lt;ref name="ecklund sheitle Buffalo univ"&gt;{{cite web|last=Donovan|first=Patricia|title=Scientists May Not Be Very Religious, but Science May Not Be to Blame|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2007/06/8732.html|publisher=University at Buffalo New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, factors such as upbringing, age, and family size were significant influences on religious identification since those who had religious upbringing were more likely to be religious and those who had a non-religious upbringing were more likely to not be religious.&lt;ref name="Ecklund study summary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ecklund sheitle Buffalo univ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecklund Scientist Demographics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ecklund|first1=Elaine Howard|last2=Scheitle|first2=Christopher P.|title=Religion among Academic Scientists: Distinctions, Disciplines, and Demographics|journal=Social Problems|date=May 2007|volume=54|issue=2|pages=289–307|doi=10.1525/sp.2007.54.2.289}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors also found little difference in religiosity between social and natural scientists.&lt;ref name="Ecklund Scientist Demographics" /&gt;

Many studies have been conducted in the [[United States]] and have generally found that scientists are less likely to believe in God than are the rest of the population. Precise definitions and statistics vary, with some studies concluding that about {{frac|1|3}} of scientists in the U.S. are atheists, {{frac|1|3}} agnostic, and {{frac|1|3}} have some belief in God (although some might be [[deistic]], for example).&lt;ref name="east1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson, E.

In terms of perceptions, most social and natural scientists from 21 American universities did not perceive conflict between science and religion, while 37% did.

A 2009 report by the [[Pew Research Center]] found that members of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) were "much less religious than the general public," with 51% believing in some form of deity or higher power.

According to the poll, just over half of scientists (51%) believe in some form of deity or higher power; specifically, 33% of scientists say they believe in God, while 18% believe in a universal spirit or higher power.|accessdate=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 48% say they have a religious affiliation, equal to the number who say they are not affiliated with any religious tradition. 17% were atheists, 11% were agnostics, 20% were nothing in particular, 8% were Jewish, 10% were Catholic, 16% were Protestant, 4% were Evangelical, 10% were other religion. The survey also found younger scientists to be "substantially more likely than their older counterparts to say they believe in God". Among the surveyed fields, chemists were the most likely to say they believe in God.&lt;ref name="people-press.org" /&gt;

Elaine Ecklund conducted a study from 2011 to 2014 involving the general US population, including rank and file scientists, in collaboration with the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS). The study noted that 76% of the scientists identified with a religious tradition. 85% of evangelical scientists had no doubts about the existence of God, compared to 35% of the whole scientific population. In terms of religion and science, 85% of evangelical scientists saw no conflict (73% collaboration, 12% independence), while 75% of the whole scientific population saw no conflict (40% collaboration, 35% independence).&lt;ref name="Ecklund AAAS" /&gt;

Religious beliefs of US professors were examined using a nationally representative sample of more than 1,400 professors. They found that in the social sciences: 23% did not believe in God, 16% did not know if God existed, 43% believed God existed, and 16% believed in a higher power. Out of the natural sciences: 20% did not believe in God, 33% did not know if God existed, 44% believed God existed, and 4% believed in a higher power. Overall, out of the whole study: 10% were atheists, 13% were agnostic, 19% believe in a higher power, 4% believe in God some of the time, 17% had doubts but believed in God, 35% believed in God and had no doubts.&lt;ref name=gross2009&gt;Neil Gross and Solon Simmons (2009).

Farr Curlin, a [[University of Chicago]] Instructor in Medicine and a member of the [[MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics]], noted in a study that doctors tend to be science-minded religious people. He helped author a study that "found that 76 percent of doctors believe in God and 59 percent believe in some sort of afterlife." Furthermore, "90 percent of doctors in the United States attend religious services at least occasionally, compared to 81 percent of all adults." He reasoned, "The responsibility to care for those who are suffering and the rewards of helping those in need resonate throughout most religious traditions."&lt;ref name="chronicle.uchicago.edu" /&gt;

Physicians in the United States, by contrast, are much more religious than scientists, with 76% stating a belief in God.&lt;ref name="chronicle.uchicago.edu"&gt;Easton, John.

According to the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture's report on 1,100 scientists in India: 66% are Hindu, 14% did not report a religion, 10% are atheist/no religion, 3% are Muslim, 3% are Christian, 4% are Buddhist, Sikh or other.&lt;ref name="Keysar India"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keysar|first1=Ariela|last2=Kosmin|first2=Barry|title=Worldviews and Opinions of Scientists: India 2007-2008|date=2008|publisher=Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC)|location=Trinity College|url=https://commons.trincoll.edu/worldviewsofscientists/report/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 39% have a belief in a god, 6% have belief in a god sometimes, 30% do not believe in a god but believe in a higher power, 13% do not know if there is a god, and 12% do not believe in a god.&lt;ref name="Keysar India" /&gt; 49% believe in the efficacy of prayer, 90% strongly agree or somewhat agree with approving degrees in Ayurvedic medicine. Furthermore, the term "secularism" is understood to have diverse and simultaneous meanings among Indian scientists: 93% believe it to be tolerance of religions and philosophies, 83% see it as involving separation of church and state, 53% see it as not identifying with religious traditions, 40% see it as absence of religious beliefs, and 20% see it as atheism. Accordingly, 75% of Indian scientists had a "secular" outlook in terms of being tolerant of other religions.&lt;ref name="Keysar India" /&gt;

According to the Religion Among Scientists in International Context (RASIC) study on 1,581 scientists from the United Kingdom and 1,763 scientists from India, along with 200 interviews: 65% of U.K. scientists identified as nonreligious and only 6% of Indian scientists identify as nonreligious, 12% of scientists in the U.K. attend religious services on a regular basis and 32% of scientists in India do.&lt;ref name="Ecklund UK Indian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCaig|first1=Amy|title=Indian scientists significantly more religious than UK scientists|url=http://news.rice.edu/2014/09/24/indian-scientists-significantly-more-religious-than-uk-scientists/|website=Rice University News|publisher=Rice University|date=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the Indian scientists, 73% of scientists responded that there are basic truths in many religions, 27% said they believe in God and 38% expressed belief in a higher power of some kind.&lt;ref name="Ecklund UK Indian" /&gt; In terms of perceptions of conflict between science and religion, less than half of both U.K. scientists (38%) and Indian scientists (18%) perceived conflict between religion and science.&lt;ref name="Ecklund UK Indian" /&gt;

According to Renny Thomas' study on Indian scientists, atheistic scientists in India called themselves atheists even while accepting that their lifestyle is very much a part of tradition and religion. Thus, they differ from Western atheists in that for them following the lifestyle of a religion is not antithetical to atheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Renny|title=Atheism and Unbelief among Indian Scientists: Towards an Anthropology of Atheism(s)|journal=Society and Culture in South Asia|date=27 December 2016|volume=3|issue=1|pages=45–67|doi=10.1177/2393861716674292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overall summary===
{{See|Conflict thesis#Modern views}}

Over time, scientists and historians have moved away from the conflict thesis and toward compatibility theses (either the integration thesis or non-overlapping magisteria). Many experts have now adopted a "complexity thesis" that combines several other models,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Richard H. (2011). For the Glory of God : The Role of Christianity in the Rise and Development of Modern Science. University Press of America. Pg. 139. {{ISBN|9780761855668}}.&lt;/ref&gt; further at the expense of the conflict thesis.

Global studies which have pooled data on religion and science from 1981–2001, have noted that countries with high religiosity also have stronger faith in science, while less religious countries have more skepticism of the impact of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norris|first=Pippa|title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-64837-1|edition=2nd|author2=Ronald Inglehart |pages=67–68|quote=Instead, as is clearly shown in Figure 3.3, societies with greater faith in science also often have ''stronger'' religious beliefs." and "Indeed, the secular postindustrial societies, exemplified by the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, prove most skeptical toward the impact of science and technology, and this is in accordance with the countries where the strongest public disquiet has been expressed about certain contemporary scientific developments such as the use of genetically modified organisms, biotechnological cloning, and nuclear power. Interestingly, again the United States displays distinctive attitudes compared with similar European nations, showing greater faith in both God and scientific progress.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is noted there as distinctive because of greater faith in both God and scientific progress. Other research cites the [[National Science Foundation]]'s finding that America has more favorable public attitudes towards science than Europe, Russia, and Japan despite differences in levels of religiosity in these cultures.&lt;ref name="global public science"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keeter|first=Scott|title=The Culture of Science: How the Public Relates to Science Across the Globe|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-87369-7|author2=Smith, Gregory |author3=Masci, David |pages=336, 345–47|chapter=Religious Belief and Attitudes about Science in the United States|quote=The United States is perhaps the most religious out of the advanced industrial democracies." ; "In fact, large majorities of the traditionally religious American nevertheless hold very positive views of science and scientists. Even people who accept a strict creationist view, regarding the origins of life are mostly favorable towards science." ; "Our review of three important issues on the public policy agenda in the United States suggest that although there is a potential for broad religiously based conflict over science, the scope of this conflict is limited. Only on one issue does a significant portion of the public deny strong consensus for religious reasons: evolution. The significance of this disagreement should not be understated, but it is decidedly unrepresentative of the broader set of scientific controversies and issues. As already noted, it is difficult to find any other major policy issues on which there are strong religious objections to scientific research. Religious concerns do arise in connection with a number of areas of life sciences research, such as the effort to develop medical therapies from embryonic stem cells. But these are not rooted in disputes about the truth of scientific research, and can be found across the spectrum of religious sentiment." ; "According to the National Science Foundation, public attitudes about science are more favorable in the United States than in Europe, Russia, and Japan, despite great differences across these cultures in level of religiosity (National Science Foundation, 2008).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted on adolescents from Christian schools in Northern Ireland, noted a positive relationship between attitudes towards Christianity and science once attitudes towards [[scientism]] and creationism were accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=Leslie J.|author2=Greer, John E. |title=Shaping Adolescents' Attitudes towards Science and Religion in Northern Ireland: The role of scientism, creationism and denominational schools|journal=Research in Science &amp; Technological Education|date=1 May 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=39–53|doi=10.1080/02635140120046213|bibcode = 2001RSTEd..19...39J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on people from Sweden concludes that though the Swedes are among the most non-religious, paranormal beliefs are prevalent among both the young and adult populations. This is likely due to a loss of confidence in institutions such as the Church and Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sjodin|first1=Ulf|title=The Swedes and the Paranormal|journal=Journal of Contemporary Religion|date=2002|volume=17|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning specific topics like creationism, it is not an exclusively American phenomenon. A poll on adult Europeans revealed that 40% believed in naturalistic evolution, 21% in theistic evolution, 20% in special creation, and 19% are undecided; with the highest concentrations of young earth creationists in Switzerland (21%), Austria (20%), Germany (18%).&lt;ref name="Numbers Internat.

Creationism" /&gt;

According to a 2015 Pew Research Center Study on the public perceptions on science, people's perceptions on conflict with science have more to do with their perceptions of other people's beliefs than their own personal beliefs. For instance, the majority of people with a religious affiliation (68%) saw no conflict between their own personal religious beliefs and science while the majority of those without a religious affiliation (76%) perceived science and religion to be in conflict.&lt;ref name="2015 Pew Perceptions"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Funk|first1=Cary|last2=Alper|first2=Becka|title=Religion and Science: Highly Religious Americans are less likely than others to see Conflict between Faith and Science.|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/22/science-and-religion/|website=Pew Research Center|publisher=Pew|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study noted that people who are not affiliated with any religion, also known as "religiously unaffiliated", often have supernatural beliefs and spiritual practices despite them not being affiliated with any religion&lt;ref name="2015 Pew Perceptions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew 2012 breakdown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise-religion/ |title=Religion and the Unaffiliated |work="Nones" on the Rise |date=October 9, 2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion &amp; Public Life |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Most Nones Believe God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Most of the Religiously Unaffiliated Still Keep Belief in God|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/most-of-the-religiously-unaffiliated-still-keep-belief-in-god/|website=Pew Research Center|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also that "just one-in-six religiously unaffiliated adults (16%) say their own religious beliefs conflict with science."&lt;ref name="2015 Pew Perceptions" /&gt; Furthermore, the study observed, "The share of all adults who perceive a conflict between science and their own religious beliefs has declined somewhat in recent years, from 36% in 2009 to 30% in 2014. Among those who are affiliated with a religion, the share of people who say there is a conflict between science and their personal religious beliefs dropped from 41% to 34% during this period."&lt;ref name="2015 Pew Perceptions" /&gt;

The 2013 MIT Survey on Science, Religion and Origins examined the views of religious people in America on origins science topics like evolution, the Big Bang, and perceptions of conflicts between science and religion. It found that a large majority of religious people see no conflict between science and religion and only 11% of religious people belong to religions openly rejecting evolution. The fact that the gap between personal and official beliefs of their religions is so large suggests that part of the problem, might be defused by people learning more about their own religious doctrine and the science it endorses, thereby bridging this belief gap. The study concluded that "mainstream religion and mainstream science are neither attacking one another nor perceiving a conflict." Furthermore, they note that this conciliatory view is shared by most leading science organizations such as the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS).&lt;ref name="MIT Science religion origins"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tegmark|first1=Max|last2=Lee|first2=Eugena|title=The MIT Survey on Science, Religion and Origins: the Belief Gap|url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/survey.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|date=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study collecting data from 2011 to 2014 on the general public, with focus on evangelicals and evangelical scientists was done in collaboration with the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS). Even though evangelicals only make up 26% of the US population, the found that nearly 70 percent of all evangelical Christians do not view science and religion as being in conflict with each other (48% saw them as complementary and 21% saw them as independent) while 73% of the general US population saw no conflict as well.&lt;ref name="Ecklund AAAS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ecklund|first1=Elaine|title=Religious Communities, Science, Scientists, and Perceptions: A Comprehensive Survey|url=http://elainehowardecklund.blogs.rice.edu/files/2014/02/RU_AAASPresentationNotes_2014_0220.pdf|website=Elaine Ecklund Blog|publisher=Rice University|date=February 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCaig AAAS Study"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCaig|first1=Amy|title=Nearly 70 percent of evengelicals do not view religion and science as being in conflict|url=http://news.rice.edu/2015/03/13/nearly-70-percent-of-evangelicals-do-not-view-religion-and-science-as-being-in-conflict/|website=Unconventional Wisdom|publisher=Rice University|date=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other lines of research on perceptions of science among the American public conclude that most religious groups see no general epistemological conflict with science and they have no differences with nonreligious groups in the propensity of seeking out scientific knowledge, although there may be subtle epistemic or moral conflicts when scientists make counterclaims to religious tenets.&lt;ref name="epistemic moral conflict"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=John|title=Epistemological and Moral Conflict Between Religion and Science|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year=2011|volume=50|issue=4|pages=707–27|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2011.01603.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Joseph O.|journal=Public Understanding of Science|title=Public Perceptions of Incompatibility Between "Science and Religion"|year=2012|volume=21|issue=3|pages=340–53|doi=10.1177/0963662511434908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings from the Pew Center note similar findings and also note that the majority of Americans (80–90%) show strong support for scientific research, agree that science makes society and individual's lives better, and 8 in 10 Americans would be happy if their children were to become scientists.&lt;ref name="Pew Public Understanding"&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Belief and Public Attitudes About Science in the US|url=http://pewresearch.org/assets/pdf/667.pdf|publisher=Pew Research Center|author1=Scott Keeter|author2=Gregory Smith|author3=David Masci|pages=1–2, 13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619225841/http://pewresearch.org/assets/pdf/667.pdf|archivedate=2012-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even strict creationists tend to have very favorable views on science.&lt;ref name="global public science" /&gt;

According to a 2007 poll by the [[Pew Forum]], "while large majorities of Americans respect science and scientists, they are not always willing to accept scientific findings that squarely contradict their religious beliefs."&lt;ref name=pew2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=275|title=Science in America: Religious Belief and Public Attitudes|publisher=The Pew Forum|date=18 December 2007|accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pew Forum states that specific factual disagreements are "not common today", though 40% to 50% of Americans do not accept the evolution of humans and other living things, with the "strongest opposition" coming from evangelical Christians at 65% saying life did not evolve.&lt;ref name=pew2007 /&gt; 51% of the population believes humans and other living things evolved: 26% through natural selection only, 21% somehow guided, 4% don't know.&lt;ref name=pew2007 /&gt; In the U.S., biological evolution is the only concrete example of conflict where a significant portion of the American public denies scientific consensus for religious reasons.&lt;ref name="global public science" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pew2007 /&gt; In terms of advanced industrialized nations, the United States is the most religious.&lt;ref name=pew2007 /&gt;

A 2009 study from the Pew Research Center on Americans perceptions of science, showed a broad consensus that most Americans, including most religious Americans, hold scientific research and scientists themselves in high regard. The study showed that 84% of Americans say they view science as having a mostly positive impact on society. Among those who attend religious services at least once a week, the number is roughly the same at 80%. Furthermore, 70% of U.S. adults think scientists contribute "a lot" to society.&lt;ref name="pew 2009 bulletin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Opinion on Religion and Science in the United States|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2009/11/05/public-opinion-on-religion-and-science-in-the-united-states/|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study on a national sample of US college students examined whether these students viewed the science / religion relationship as reflecting primarily conflict, collaboration, or independence. The study concluded that the majority of undergraduates in both the natural and social sciences do not see conflict between science and religion. Another finding in the study was that it is more likely for students to move away from a conflict perspective to an independence or collaboration perspective than towards a conflict view.&lt;ref name=scheitle11&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2868">'''Abramzon Saul Matvei''' ('''Абрамзон Саул Матвеевич''') (July 3, 1905 – 1977) was a [[scientist]]-[[ethnographer]], [[Turkologist]], and specialist in [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] [[ethnology]]. Saul Abramzon graduated [[Leningrad University]] in the former [[USSR]]; he specialized in Turkic ethnology under Turkologists [[Samoilovich Alexander N.|Samoilovich A.N.]] and [[Sergey Malov|S. E. Malov]]. Residing mostly in [[Leningrad]], and working in Leningrad section of the Ethnography Institute, Saul Abramzon at the same time was a member of Kyrgyz scientific commission on history, began scientific ethnography of the Kyrgyz people, and directed the Kyrgyz State museum in the Kyrgyz capital, [[Bishkek|Frunze]], at that time, working simultaneously as a deputy director of the Kyrgyz Scientific Research Institute, a scientific custodian the Kyrgyz State museum, and later a director of the Kyrgyz Ethnological Institute.

Almost all ethnographic expeditions carried out in Kyrgyzstan from 1926 to the 1960s were conducted under Saul Abramzon's leadership. In the process, Saul Abramzon brought up a generation of Kyrgyzstan expert ethnographers.

The range of scientific problems in which Abramzon was engaged was wide and covered almost all aspects of ethnography of the [[Kyrgyz people]]. The major theme of S. Abramzon research was ethnogenetic, historical and cultural connections of Kyrgyz with peoples of [[Middle Asia]], Southern [[Siberia]] and the [[Central Asia]], forms of Kyrgyz economic activities, material culture, ceremonies, customs and beliefs. Saul Abramzon left a huge scientific heritage: [[monography|monographies]], articles, reviews. They are stored in History Institute of Kyrgyzstan Academy of Sciences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14962">The '''Sigma I-67 and II-67 War Games''' were two of a series of [[Classified information|classified]] high level [[Wargaming|war games]] played in [[the Pentagon]] during the 1960s to strategize the conduct of the burgeoning [[Vietnam War]]. The games were designed to replicate then-current conditions in [[Indochina]], with an aim toward predicting future foreign affairs events. They were staffed with high-ranking officials standing in to represent both domestic and foreign characters; stand-ins were chosen for their expertise concerning those they were called upon to represent. The games were supervised by a Control appointed to oversee both sides. The opposing Blue and Red Teams customary in war games were designated the friendly and enemy forces as was usual; however, several smaller teams were sometimes subsumed under Red and Blue Teams. Over the course of the games, the Red Team at times contained the Yellow Team for the [[People's Republic of China]], the Brown Team for the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]], the Black Team for the [[Viet Cong]],&lt;ref name=allen193&gt;Allen, pp. 193-208.&lt;/ref&gt; and Green for the [[USSR]].&lt;ref name=gibbons17&gt;Gibbons, pp. 17-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preparation for these simulations was quite extensive. A game staff of as many as 45 people researched and developed the scenarios. The actual play of the war game involved 30 to 35 participants. There are four or five simulations per year, solicited secretively from the [[State Department]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], and major military commands.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, pp. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sigma I-67 and Sigma II-67 war games were played concurrently; with two simulations playing two teams simultaneously, there were over 100 participants.

==Background==

Both the Sigma I-67 and Sigma II-67 [[Top Secret]]&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. C-1.&lt;/ref&gt; politico-military war games were staged concurrently between 27 November and 7 December 1967. The simulations were played between 0900 and 1800 hours in [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] chambers provided by the Joint War Games Agency of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff, pp. A-1, C-57.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sigma games' focus was on settling the [[Vietnam War]] rather than winning it.&lt;ref name=gibbons941/&gt; Despite this change of focus, there was ample experience with these simulations, given the precedent set by prior Sigma games dating back to 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. C-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Sigma I-67 and Sigma II-67 were assigned a Control. Either game had both a Blue and a Red Team. The Blue Team in either game represented the United States, although a pair of its players were designated as the Government of Vietnam (GVN). Either Red Team played as the [[North Vietnam]]ese communists in their respective games; they also each had a two-man detachment appointed as the [[Viet Cong|South Vietnamese communists]]. Control's functions included playing other nations and global organizations.&lt;ref name=staffA1&gt;Staff, p. A-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Control also served as the link between the opposing sides via messaging.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. C-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning scenario==
Game scenarios were based on extensive research into the ongoing events that the war games were going to simulate. Both games began their simulations from the same scenario set on the same future date. The U.S. Blue Team purportedly receives a confidential message from the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] on 25 January 1968, proposing a basis for negotiations to end the [[Vietnam War]]. If the United States will quit bombing their country, the Red Team communists will meet in a third party's capital to arrange a settlement. On 2 February 1968, the Blue Team secretly agrees to halt their bombing campaign,&lt;ref name=staffA1/&gt; although still maintaining aerial surveillance over the north and suffering numerous consequent losses. In turn, Red Team uses the respite to reconstruct their bombed [[lines of communication]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. B-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sigma I-67===
Hidden in the Sigma I-67 scenario, and withheld from Blue Team, was Red Team's secret determination to make gains at Blue Team's expense via any possible bargaining, no matter how cynical.&lt;ref name=staffA1/&gt; At one point, a Red Team member stated: "We had no good faith whatsoever."&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. C-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sigma II-67 ===
Red Team played with a different implicit set of hidden imperatives for Sigma II-67. Unbeknownst to Blue, Red's military force in South Vietnam was thrashed. Its Russian and Chinese sponsors in the [[proxy war]] were slacking their support. There was internal dissension in the northern populace. Therefore, on 2 February 1968, when the U.S. covertly agreed to halt bombing North Vietnam, Red pushed for an extension of the ongoing [[Tết]] holiday ceasefire. Blue had already considered and rejected that move; instead, it maintained its military operations against the communists.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, pp. A-4, A-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simulations played ==

===Sigma I-67===
Red Team quickly amassed its troops in [[North Vietnam]] and infiltrated not only [[South Vietnam]], but [[Cambodia]] and [[Kingdom of Laos|Laos]]. In the meantime, they carried on negotiations as a distracting political tactic as they feverishly rebuilt destroyed infrastructure.&lt;ref name=staffA2&gt;Staff, pp. A-2, B-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

As its move, Blue Team abandoned its [[search and destroy]] tactics and dispersed its ground troops into small units protecting the South Vietnamese populace. The bombing effort now focused on the South.&lt;ref name=staffA2/&gt;

Red Team's counterattacks on these village security units revealed the shallowness of Red's commitment to settlement talks. However, they felt it necessary to try to force American troops back into larger centralized units. They also repatriated their air defense [[MiG]] fighters from the [[People's Republic of China]] as the North's airfields were repaired.&lt;ref name=staffA2/&gt;
 
Blue now found itself hampered in its negotiating stance by [[Thai people|Thai]] and [[South Korea]]n allies clamoring for a say in any ceasefire. Also, the GVN quietly messaged the North Vietnamese communists to inform them that any deals made without southern participation would not be recognized by the GVN.&lt;ref name=staffA2/&gt;

Red also found itself in trouble with its ally. China threatened an end to its military aid, stationed a [[Wing (military aviation unit)|fighter wing]] and two [[Division (military)|divisions]] on its Vietnamese border, and slowed [[Soviet]] military aid transiting its territory.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, pp. A-2, A-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these obstacles, Control decreed negotiations would begin on 7 March 1968 in [[Paris]]. Agenda items were de-escalation, a ceasefire, withdrawal of troops, and exchange of [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. However, the GVN players on Blue Team balked. They were ready to sabotage the talks; they wanted to preserve the South's territory, worried that they might be forced into [[coalition government]] with the Viet Cong, and feared a premature withdrawal of U.S. forces.&lt;ref name=staffA3&gt;Staff, p. A-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Team now changed to demanding that American forces had to withdraw from Vietnam before the communists would cease firing. The ultimatum named 4 June 1968 as a deadline; after that date, Red would re-initiate hostilities with the aim of raising the U.S. casualty rate enough to arouse the American public.&lt;ref name=staffA3/&gt;

Blue concluded by electing to resume the air offensive if negotiations were unsuccessful. However, that resumption was subject to influence by public opinion. Control introduced a [[Concurrent resolution|congressional resolution]] that prohibited hostile military moves against Red while talks were in progress.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, pp. A-3, A-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sigma II-67===

Red Team began its simulation plagued by political dissidence by the [[National Liberation Front for South Vietnam]] in the [[Mekong Delta]]. The NLF in the Delta tried to sabotage the negotiations. Blue Team's opening move was a rejection of the idea of dispersing forces into village security units. It was believed that the tactic might lead to defeat of some of the village security units, as well as allowing the [[Viet Cong]] to re-form into larger units for operations. In turn, Blue redirected its air power so it struck entirely in the South.&lt;ref name=staffA2/&gt;

Having had its push for a post-Tet ceasefire denied, the North Vietnamese were desperate for a formal ceasefire before negotiations began. They made a token withdrawal of a [[Brigade (military)|brigade]] back into the North while pulling other troops back from combat into sanctuaries. On 13 February 1968, a four party meeting among the warring parties began in [[Yangon]]. Game Control then mandated a military stand-down by both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. A-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. continued aerial surveillance of the North while suppressing communist guerrilla activity in the Mekong Delta. It also began to convert the irregulars of the [[Civilian Irregular Defense Group program]] (CIDG) into constabulary. In the meantime, formal talks in Yangon quickly settled the matter of repatriating wounded [[prisoners of war]]. Further discussion was scheduled between Red and Blue on 1 March 1968. Onsite were also outside observers from the [[USSR]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Kingdom of Thailand]], [[Republic of Korea]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=staffA6/&gt;

Although both teams harbored disagreements within their ranks, Control bent the course of the play toward talks. The mediators glossed over GVN non-cooperation and the Viet Cong attempt to undercut its own side. The fighting in South Vietnam had dwindled; Blue moved into [[civic action program]]s by its troops. On 28 April 1968, the Rangoon Conference adjourned, leaving subcommittees to work out procedures for a continuing truce, troop reductions and withdrawals, and the integration of the NLF into Southern politics.&lt;ref name=staffA6&gt;Staff, p. A-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most importantly, the two sides agreed to internationally supervised elections for South Vietnam's [[Constituent Assembly]] on 1 July 1968. [[Primary election]]s for government office would be held on 1 August. General elections would follow on 1 September. On 1 October, the Assembly would start writing a new constitution for South Vietnam. Blue demanded majority election of every Assembly member, believing that most favorable to their aims. It also offered to remove its troops from Vietnam six months later.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. A-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Red Team was willing to hold elections under the existing South Vietnamese constitution, Blue insisted on adoption of a new constitution that would favor its side.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. C-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== End results ==

=== Sigma I-67 ===

The consensus was that Red Team made considerable gains while playing out their scenario. They revitalized their military forces. An influx of [[Third World]] technicians was judged to inhibit resumption of U.S. air strikes for the fear of causing [[Collateral damage#Controversy|collateral damage]] casualties. On the other hand, Blue Team was wracked by dissension within its ranks and under pressure by the U.S. public for a speedy peace.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. A-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sigma II-67 ===
By 28 April 1968, Blue Team had come to doubt Red's sincerity in negotiations. Blue's ranks were split over the question of whether NLF participation in South Vietnamese politics would inevitably lead to a takeover by the communists, and about the chances of success in an election.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. A-8.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the United States overrode its South Vietnamese ally.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. C-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The South Vietnamese were content to let the Americans take the brunt of the fighting while they provided security to their fellow citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. C-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debriefing conclusions==
All four teams from both war games debriefed simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, pp. C-1 through C-93.&lt;/ref&gt; Common conclusions were that even a token withdrawal from Vietnam by the U.S. would spark pressure to continue the exodus. It was also felt that withdrawal would be a one-way exit for the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. B-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The game's director decided that the two sides were unlikely to arrange a ceasefire, and that a unilateral truce by the U.S. would fail.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. C-46.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also believed that the communists would not engage in free elections even in favorable circumstances for fear of losing at the polls.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. B-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Theodore Wade-Gery''', [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (2 April 1888 – 2 January 1972), known as '''Theodore Wade-Gery''' or '''H. T. Wade-Gery''', was a classical scholar, historian and [[epigrapher]]. From 1939 to 1953, he was [[Wykeham Professor of Ancient History]] at the [[University of Oxford]].

==Life==
Born into a long-established Bedfordshire family, Wade-Gery was educated at [[Winchester College]], a contemporary of [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] and [[Reginald Gleadowe|R.M.Y. Gleadowe]], and at [[New College, Oxford]], which he left with a [[First class degree|First]] in [[Classical Moderations]] in 1911. After a short spell in the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]] he was offered a [[Teaching fellow|tutorial fellowship]] in 1914 at [[Wadham College, Oxford]]. Almost immediately however he left for military service in the First World War in the army on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], during which he was awarded the [[Military Cross|MC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29608 |supp=y |date=2 June 1916 |page=5577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the war Wade-Gery returned to Wadham, eventually becoming [[Warden (college)|Sub-Warden]]. He remained at Wadham until 1939, when on his election as [[Wykeham Professor of Ancient History]] he became a Fellow of [[New College, Oxford|New College]]. In 1941 he was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]]. He retired from his Chair in 1953 and was offered a five-year Research Fellowship at [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]], two years of which he spent at [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. For the next ten years or so he continued to travel and to write (his last publication was in 1966) until after a few years of declining health he died of a heart attack in 1972.

==Works==
In 1915 three of Wade-Gery'ss poems were published in that year's ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'' volume,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnelson.demon.co.uk/oxpoetry/index/iw.html |title=Oxford Poetry: Index of Contributors: W |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003035247/http://www.gnelson.demon.co.uk/oxpoetry/index/iw.html |archive-date=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which work by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] also appeared. After his safe return from the war he published "Terpsichore and Other Poems", a collection of his poetry, in 1922, but future publications were devoted to his academic work and especially to [[epigraphy]]. He is often cited by classical scholars for his suggestion that the Greek alphabet was adapted from Phoenician script in the 8th century BC with the express purpose of recording Homer's monumental epics.

His writing was mostly in the form of articles in learned journals. 
His principal publications were: 
* ''Pindar: Pythian Odes'', 1928 (Nonesuch Press), jointly with [[Maurice Bowra]];
* ''The Athenian Tribute Lists'' (4 vols), 1939–53 (American School of Classical Studies at Athens), as a joint author with [[Benjamin D. Meritt]] and Malcolm F. McGregor;
* ''The Poet of the Iliad'', 1952 (CUP), the published form of his J.H. Gray lectures given at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] in 1949;
* ''Essays in Greek History'', 1958 (Blackwell).

==Family==
In 1928 Wade-Gery married Vivian Whitfield (1897–1988), an archaeologist. They had one son, [[Robert Wade-Gery]] (later Sir Robert), who was born in 1929.

'''Thor Heyerdahl''' ({{IPA-no|tuːr ˈhæɪəɖɑːl}}; October 6, 1914&amp;nbsp;– April 18, 2002) was a Norwegian [[adventure]]r and [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] with a background in [[zoology]], [[botany]], and [[geography]]. He became notable for his [[Kon-Tiki expedition|''Kon-Tiki'' expedition]] in 1947, in which he sailed 8,000&amp;nbsp;km (5,000&amp;nbsp;mi) across the Pacific Ocean in a hand-built raft from [[South America]] to the [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu Islands]]. The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between separate cultures. This was linked to a [[diffusionism|diffusionist]] model of cultural development. Heyerdahl subsequently made other voyages designed to demonstrate the possibility of contact between widely separated ancient people, notably the ''Ra II'' expedition of 1970, when he sailed from the west coast of Africa to [[Barbados]] in a papyrus reed boat. He was appointed a [[government scholar]] in 1984.

In May 2011, the Thor Heyerdahl Archives were added to [[UNESCO]]'s "[[Memory of the World]]" Register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=31401&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714094241/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=31401&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 14, 2012 |title=New collections come to enrich the Memory of the World |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=September 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, this list included 238 collections from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/mow/nomination_forms/norway_thor_heyerdahl_archives.pdf |title=Memory of the World Register Application form from Kon-Tiki Museum for Thor Heyerdahl Archives |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Heyerdahl Archives span the years 1937 to 2002 and include his photographic collection, diaries, private letters, expedition plans, articles, newspaper clippings, original book, and article manuscripts. The Heyerdahl Archives are administered by the [[Kon-Tiki Museum]] and the [[National Library of Norway]] in Oslo.

==Youth and personal life==
Heyerdahl was born in [[Larvik]], [[Norway]], the son of master brewer Thor Heyerdahl (1869–1957) and his wife, Alison Lyng (1873–1965). As a young child, Heyerdahl showed a strong interest in zoology, inspired by his mother who had a strong interest in [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]]. He created a small [[museum]] in his childhood home, with a common adder (''[[Vipera berus]]'') as the main attraction. He studied [[zoology]] and [[geography]] at the faculty of biological science at the [[University of Oslo]].&lt;ref&gt;Thor Heyerdahl, In the Footsteps of Adam: A Memoir, London: Abacus Books, 2001, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he privately studied [[Polynesia]]n culture and history, consulting what was then the world's largest private collection of books and papers on Polynesia, owned by Bjarne Kroepelien, a wealthy wine merchant in Oslo. (This collection was later purchased by the University of Oslo Library from Kroepelien's heirs and was attached to the [[Kon-Tiki Museum]] research department.) After seven terms and consultations with experts in [[Berlin]], a project was developed and sponsored by Heyerdahl's zoology professors, [[Kristine Bonnevie]] and Hjalmar Broch. He was to visit some isolated Pacific island groups and study how the local animals had found their way there.

Just before sailing together to the [[Marquesas Islands]] in 1936, Heyerdahl married his first wife, Liv Coucheron-Torp (1916–1969{{dubious|reason=conflicts with second marriage also ending in 1969|date=March 2018}}), whom he had met shortly before enrolling at the university, and who had studied [[economics]] there. The couple had two sons: Thor&amp;nbsp;Jr and Bjørn. The marriage ended in divorce.

After the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]], he served with the [[Free Norwegian Forces]] from 1944, in the far north province of [[Finnmark]].&lt;ref name=obit1&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2002/apr/19/travelnews.internationaleducationnews.highereducation Obituary], Jo Anne Van Tilburg, 19 April 2002, The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=obit2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1938294.stm "Explorer Thor Heyerdahl dies"], 18 April 2002, BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Heyerdahl married Yvonne Dedekam-Simonsen (1924–2006). They had three daughters: Annette, Marian and Helene Elisabeth. They were divorced in 1969. Heyerdahl blamed their separation on his being away from home and differences in their ideas for bringing up children. In his autobiography, he concluded that he should take the entire blame for their separation.&lt;ref&gt;Thor Heyerdahl, "In the Footsteps of Adam". Christophersen translation ({{ISBN|0-349-11273-8}}), London: Abacus, 2001, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Heyerdahl married [[Jacqueline Beer]] (born 1932) as his third wife. They lived in [[Tenerife]], [[Canary Islands]] and were very actively involved with archaeological projects, especially in [[Túcume]], Peru, and [[Azov]] until his death in 2002. He still had been hoping to undertake an archaeological project in [[Samoa]] before he died.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bjornar Storfjell, "Thor Heyerdahl's Final Projects". in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 10:2 (Summer 2002), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heyerdahl died on April 18, 2002, in [[Colla Micheri]], [[Liguria]], [[Italy]], where he had gone to spend the Easter holidays with some of his closest family members. The Norwegian government gave him a state funeral in Oslo Cathedral on April 26, 2002. He is buried in the garden of the family home in Colla Micheri.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bjornar Storfjell, "[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai102_folder/102_articles/102_heyerdahl_storfjell.html Thor Heyerdahl's Final Projects]," in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 10:2 (Summer 2002), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; He was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/science-obituaries/1391410/Thor-Heyerdahl.html|title=Thor Heyerdahl|publisher=|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://world.wng.org/2013/05/kon_tiki|title=Kon-Tiki - WORLD|publisher=|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fatu Hiva==
The events surrounding his stay on the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], most of the time on [[Fatu Hiva]], were told first in his book ''På Jakt etter Paradiset'' (''Hunt for Paradise'') (1938), which was published in Norway but, following the outbreak of [[World War II]], never translated and largely forgotten. Many years later, having achieved notability with other adventures and books on other subjects, Heyerdahl published a new account of this voyage under the title ''[[Fatu Hiva (book)|Fatu Hiva]]'' (London: [[Allen &amp; Unwin]], 1974). The story of his time on Fatu Hiva and his side trip to Hivaoa and Mohotani is also related in ''Green Was the Earth on the Seventh Day '' ([[Random House]], 1996).

==''Kon-Tiki'' expedition==
{{Main|Kon-Tiki expedition}}
In 1947, Heyerdahl and five fellow adventurers sailed from [[Peru]] to the [[Tuamotu Islands]], [[French Polynesia]] in a [[pae-pae]] [[raft]] that they had constructed from [[balsa]] wood and other native materials, christened the ''[[Kon-Tiki]]''. The ''Kon-Tiki'' expedition was inspired by old reports and drawings made by the Spanish [[Conquistadors]] of [[Inca Empire|Inca]] rafts, and by native legends and archaeological evidence suggesting contact between [[South America]] and [[Polynesia]]. The ''Kon-Tiki'' smashed into the [[reef]] at [[Raroia]] in the Tuamotus on August 7, 1947, after a 101-day, 4,300-nautical-mile (5,000-mile or 8,000&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;ref&gt;"[http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai144_folder/144_articles/144_index.html Quick Facts: Comparing the Two Rafts: Kon-Tiki and Tangaroa,"] in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 14:4 (Winter 2006), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; journey across the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Heyerdahl had nearly drowned at least twice in childhood and did not take easily to water; he said later that there were times in each of his raft voyages when he feared for his life.&lt;ref&gt;Personal correspondence via fax on February 2, 1995, to Editor Betty Blair, Azerbaijan International magazine for article "Kon-Tiki Man", [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/31_folder/31_articles/31_thorheyerdahl.html Azerbaijan International, Vol. 3:1 (Spring 1995), pp. 62-63].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kon-Tiki'' demonstrated that it was possible for a primitive raft to sail the Pacific with relative ease and safety, especially to the west (with the trade winds). The raft proved to be highly manoeuvrable, and fish congregated between the nine balsa logs in such numbers that ancient sailors could have possibly relied on fish for hydration in the absence of other sources of fresh water. Other rafts have repeated the voyage, inspired by ''Kon-Tiki''. Heyerdahl's book about ''[[The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas]]'' has been translated into 70 languages.&lt;ref&gt;Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki has been translated into 71 languages, according to the Director of Kon-Tiki Museum, September 2013. Azerbaijani language being the 70th.&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary film of the expedition entitled ''[[Kon-Tiki (1950 film)|Kon-Tiki]]'' won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 1951. A dramatised version was released in 2012, also called ''[[Kon-Tiki (2012 film)|Kon-Tiki]]'', and was nominated for both the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Oscar]] at the [[85th Academy Awards]]&lt;ref name="85thNominees"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20959604 |title=Oscars: Hollywood announces 85th Academy Award nominations |accessdate=2013-01-10 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[70th Golden Globe Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/12/golden-globe-awards-nominations-2013/|title=lasse_hallstrom.jpg|author=Nikki Finke|work=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that a Norwegian film was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryland|first=Julie|title=Norwegian film "Kon Tiki" nominated for Oscar|url=http://www.norwaypost.no/index.php/news/latest-news/27960-qkon-tikiq-wins-nomination-for-oscar-|work=The Norway Post|accessdate=11 January 2013|date=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists continue to believe that Polynesia was [[Polynesia#History of the Polynesian people|settled]] from west to east, based on [[linguistics|linguistic]], physical, and [[genetics|genetic]] evidence, migration having begun from the Asian mainland. There are controversial indications, though, of some sort of South American/Polynesian contact, most notably in the fact that the South American [[sweet potato]] is served as a dietary staple throughout much of Polynesia. Blood samples taken in 1971 and 2008 from Easter Islanders without any European or other external descent were analysed in a 2011 study, which concluded that the evidence supported some aspects of Heyerdahl's hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20546-early-americans-helped-colonise-easter-island.html |title=Early Americans helped colonise Easter Island - life - 06&amp;nbsp;June&amp;nbsp;2011 |publisher=New Scientist |date= |accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alleyne |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/8582150/Kon-Tiki-explorer-was-partly-right-Polynesians-had-South-American-roots.html |title=Kon-Tiki explorer was partly right – Polynesians had South American roots |publisher=Telegraph |date= June 17, 2011|accessdate=September 1, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apollon.uio.no/vis/art/2007_1/Artikler/paaskeoya |title=Påskeøya: Heyerdahl kan ha hatt litt rett |language=no |publisher=Apollon |date= |accessdate=September 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930054834/http://www.apollon.uio.no/vis/art/2007_1/Artikler/paaskeoya |archivedate=September 30, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This result has been questioned because of the possibility of contamination by South Americans after European contact with the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/2012/02/did-easter-islanders-mix-it-south-americans|title=Did Easter Islanders Mix It Up With South Americans?|work=sciencemag.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent DNA work (after Heyerdahl's death) contradicts the post-European-contact contamination hypothesis, finding the South American DNA sequences to be far older than that.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/new-discoveries-show-more-contact-between-farflung-prehistoric-humans-than-had-been-thought-9814377.html|title=New findings show more contact between prehistoric humans|date=October 23, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heyerdahl had attempted to counter the linguistic argument with the analogy that he would prefer to believe that African-Americans came from Africa, judging from their skin colour, and not from England, judging from their speech.

===Theory on Polynesian origins===
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2017}}
Heyerdahl claimed that in [[Inca mythology|Incan legend]] there was a sun-god named [[Viracocha|Con-Tici Viracocha]] who was the supreme head of the mythical fair-skinned people in [[Peru]]. The original name for Viracocha was ''Kon-Tiki'' or ''Illa-Tiki'', which means ''Sun-Tiki'' or ''Fire-Tiki''.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Kon-Tiki was high priest and sun-king of these legendary "white men" who left enormous ruins on the shores of [[Lake Titicaca]]. The legend continues with the mysterious bearded white men being attacked by a chief named Cari, who came from the [[Coquimbo Region|Coquimbo Valley]]. They had a battle on an island in Lake Titicaca, and the fair race was massacred. However, Kon-Tiki and his closest companions managed to escape and later arrived on the Pacific coast. The legend ends with Kon-Tiki and his companions disappearing westward out to sea.

When the Spaniards came to Peru, Heyerdahl asserted, the Incas told them that the colossal monuments that stood deserted about the landscape were erected by a race of white gods who had lived there before the Incas themselves became rulers. The Incas described these "white gods" as wise, peaceful instructors who had originally come from the north in the "morning of time" and taught the Incas' primitive forebears architecture as well as manners and customs. They were unlike other Native Americans in that they had "white skins and long beards" and were taller than the Incas. The Incas said that the "white gods" had then left as suddenly as they had come and fled westward across the Pacific. After they had left, the Incas themselves took over power in the country.

Heyerdahl said that when the Europeans first came to the Pacific islands, they were astonished that they found some of the natives to have relatively light skins and beards. There were whole families that had pale skin, hair varying in color from reddish to blonde. In contrast, most of the Polynesians had golden-brown skin, raven-black hair, and rather flat noses. Heyerdahl claimed that when [[Jakob Roggeveen]] first discovered [[Easter Island]] in 1722, he supposedly noticed that many of the natives were white-skinned. Heyerdahl claimed that these people could count their ancestors who were "white-skinned" right back to the time of Tiki and [[Hotu Matua]], when they first came sailing across the sea "from a mountainous land in the east which was scorched by the sun". The ethnographic evidence for these claims is outlined in Heyerdahl's book ''[[Aku-Aku|Aku-Aku: The Secret of Easter Island]]''.

Heyerdahl proposed that Tiki's [[neolithic]] people colonized the then uninhabited Polynesian islands as far north as [[Hawaii]], as far south as [[New Zealand]], as far east as Easter Island, and as far west as Samoa and Tonga around 500 AD. They supposedly sailed from Peru to the Polynesian islands on ''pae-paes''—large rafts built from [[balsa]] logs, complete with sails and each with a small cottage. They built enormous stone statues carved in the image of human beings on [[Pitcairn]], the [[Marquesas]], and Easter Island that resembled those in Peru. They also built huge pyramids on [[Tahiti]] and [[Samoa]] with steps like those in Peru. But all over Polynesia, Heyerdahl found indications that Tiki's peaceable race had not been able to hold the islands alone for long. He found evidence that suggested that seagoing war canoes as large as [[Viking]] ships and lashed together two and two had brought Stone Age Northwest American Indians to Polynesia around 1100 &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt;, and they mingled with Tiki's people. The oral history of the people of Easter Island, at least as it was documented by Heyerdahl, is completely consistent with this theory, as is the [[archaeological record]] he examined (Heyerdahl 1958). In particular, Heyerdahl obtained a radiocarbon date of 400 &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt; for a charcoal fire located in the pit that was held by the people of Easter Island to have been used as an "oven" by the "Long Ears", which Heyerdahl's Rapa Nui sources, reciting oral tradition, identified as a white race that had ruled the island in the past (Heyerdahl 1958).

Heyerdahl further argued in his book ''[[American Indians in the Pacific]]'' that the current inhabitants of Polynesia migrated from an Asian source, but via an alternate route. He proposes that Polynesians travelled with the wind along the North Pacific current. These migrants then arrived in British Columbia. Heyerdahl called contemporary tribes of British Columbia, such as the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] and [[Haida people|Haida]], descendants of these migrants. Heyerdahl claimed that cultural and physical similarities existed between these British Columbian tribes, Polynesians, and the Old World source. Heyerdahl's claims aside, however, there is no evidence that the Tlingit, Haida or other British Columbian tribes have an affinity with Polynesians.

Heyerdahl's theory of Polynesian origins has not gained acceptance among [[Anthropology|anthropologists]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Suggs ''The Island Civilizations of Polynesia'', New York: New American Library, p.212-224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirch, P. (2000).

Anthropologist [[Robert Carl Suggs]] included a chapter titled "The Kon-Tiki Myth" in his 1960 book on [[Polynesia]], concluding that "The ''Kon-Tiki'' theory is about as plausible as the tales of [[Atlantis]], [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], and 'Children of the Sun.' Like most such theories, it makes exciting light reading, but as an example of scientific method it fares quite poorly."&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Suggs, ''The Island Civilizations of Polynesia'', New York: New American Library, p.224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist and [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] Explorer-in-Residence [[Wade Davis (anthropologist)|Wade Davis]] also criticised Heyerdahl's theory in his 2009 book ''The Wayfinders'', which explores the history of Polynesia. Davis says that Heyerdahl "ignored the overwhelming body of linguistic, ethnographic, and ethnobotanical evidence, augmented today by genetic and archaeological data, indicating that he was patently wrong."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wade Davis (anthropologist)|Wade Davis]], ''The Wayfinders: Why Ancient Wisdom Matters in the Modern World'', Crawley: University of Western Australia Publishing, p.46.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study by Norwegian researcher Erik Thorsby&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19493235 | doi=10.1111/j.1399-0039.2009.01233.x | volume=73 | issue=6 | title=Further evidence of an Amerindian contribution to the Polynesian gene pool on Easter Island | date=June 2009 | journal=Tissue Antigens | pages=582–5| author1=Thorsby | first1=E | last2=Flåm | first2=S.

[http://news.sciencemag.org/2012/02/did-easter-islanders-mix-it-south-americans "Did Easter Islanders Mix It Up With South Americans?"] ''[[Science News]]'', Washington, 6 February 2012. Retrieved on 7 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, more recent work{{when|date=March 2015}} indicates that the South American component of Easter Island people's genomes predates European contact: a team including Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas (from the Natural History Museum of Denmark) analysed the genomes of 27 native Rapanui people and found that their DNA was on average 76 per cent Polynesian, 8 per cent Native American and 16 per cent European. Analysis showed that: "although the European lineage could be explained by contact with white Europeans after the island was "discovered" in 1722 by Dutch sailors, the South American component was much older, dating to between about 1280 and 1495, soon after the island was first colonised by Polynesians in around 1200." Together with ancient skulls found in Brazil&amp;nbsp;– with solely Polynesian DNA&amp;nbsp;– this does suggest some pre-European-contact travel to and from South America from Polynesia.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

==Expedition to Rapa Nui (Easter Island)==
In 1955–1956, Heyerdahl organized the Norwegian Archaeological Expedition to Rapa Nui ([[Easter Island]]). The expedition's scientific staff included Arne Skjølsvold, Carlyle Smith, [[Edwin Ferdon]], Gonzalo Figueroa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Malcolm Coad |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/sep/04/archaeology |title=Gonzalo Figueroa |publisher=Guardian |date= September 4, 2008|accessdate=September 1, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Mulloy]]. Heyerdahl and the professional archaeologists who travelled with him spent several months on Rapa Nui investigating several important archaeological sites. Highlights of the project include experiments in the carving, transport and erection of the notable [[moai]], as well as excavations at such prominent sites as [[Orongo]] and [[Poike]]. The expedition published two large volumes of scientific reports (''Reports of the Norwegian Archaeological Expedition to Easter Island and the East Pacific'') and Heyerdahl later added a third (''The Art of Easter Island''). Heyerdahl's popular book on the subject, ''[[Aku-Aku]]'' was another international best-seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kon-tiki.no/|title=KON-TIKI MUSEET : THOR HEYERDAHLS FORSKNINGSSTIFTELSE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Easter Island: The Mystery Solved'' (Random House, 1989), Heyerdahl offered a more detailed theory of [[History of Easter Island|the island's history]]. Based on native testimony and archaeological research, he claimed the island was originally colonized by [[Hanau eepe]] ("Long Ears"), from South America, and that Polynesian [[Hanau momoko]] ("Short Ears") arrived only in the mid-16th century; they may have come independently or perhaps were imported as workers. According to Heyerdahl, something happened between Admiral Roggeveen's discovery of the island in 1722 and James Cook's visit in 1774; while Roggeveen encountered white, Indian, and Polynesian people living in relative harmony and prosperity, Cook encountered a much smaller population consisting mainly of Polynesians and living in privation.

Heyerdahl notes the oral tradition of an uprising of "Short Ears" against the ruling "Long Ears". The "Long Ears" dug a defensive moat on the eastern end of the island and filled it with kindling. During the uprising, Heyerdahl claimed, the "Long Ears" ignited their moat and retreated behind it, but the "Short Ears" found a way around it, came up from behind, and pushed all but two of the "Long Ears" into the fire. This moat was found by the Norwegian expedition and it was partly cut down into the rock. Layers of fire were revealed but no fragments of bodies.

As for the origin of the people of Easter Island, DNA tests have shown a connection to South America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=richard alleyne|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/8582150/Kon-Tiki-explorer-was-partly-right-Polynesians-had-South-American-roots.html |title= Thor Heyedahl |publisher=Telegraph |date= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; critics conjecture that this was a result of recent events, but whether this is inherited from a person coming in later times is hard to know. If the story that (almost) all Long Ears were killed in a civil war is true, as the islanders story goes, it would be expected that the statue-building South American bloodline would have been nearly utterly destroyed, leaving for the most part the invading Polynesian bloodline.

==Boats ''Ra'' and ''Ra II''==
[[File:RaII.InMuseum.jpg|thumb|The ''Ra II'' in the [[Kon-Tiki Museum]] in Oslo, Norway]]
In 1969 and 1970, Heyerdahl built two boats from [[papyrus]] and attempted to cross the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from [[Morocco]] in Africa. Based on drawings and models from ancient [[Egypt]], the first boat, named ''Ra'' (after [[Ra|the Egyptian Sun god]]), was constructed by boat builders from [[Lake Chad]] using papyrus reed obtained from [[Lake Tana]] in [[Ethiopia]] and launched into the Atlantic Ocean from the coast of Morocco. The Ra crew included Thor Heyerdahl (Norway), [[Norman Baker (explorer)|Norman Baker]] (USA), [[Carlo Mauri]] (Italy), [[Yuri Senkevich]] (USSR), [[Santiago Genovés]] (Mexico), Georges Sourial (Egypt) and Abdullah Djibrine (Chad). Only Heyerdahl and Baker had sailing and navigation experience. After a number of weeks, ''Ra'' took on water. The crew discovered that a key element of the Egyptian boatbuilding method had been neglected, a tether that acted like a spring to keep the stern high in the water while allowing for flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heyerdahl |first=Thor |title=The Ra Expeditions |date=1972 |page=197 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water and storms eventually caused it to sag and break apart after sailing more than 6400&amp;nbsp;km (4000 miles). The crew was forced to abandon Ra, some hundred miles (160&amp;nbsp;km) before the Caribbean islands, and was saved by a yacht.

The following year, 1970, a similar vessel, ''Ra II'', was built of [[papyrus]] by Demetrio, Juan and José Limachi from [[Lake Titicaca]] in [[Bolivia]] and likewise set sail across the Atlantic from Morocco, this time with great success. The crew was mostly the same; though Djibrine had been replaced by Kei Ohara from Japan and Madani Ait Ouhanni from Morocco. The boat became lost and was the subject of a United Nations search and rescue mission. The search included international assistance including people as far afield as [[Loo-Chi Hu]] of New Zealand. The boat reached [[Barbados]], thus demonstrating that mariners could have dealt with trans-Atlantic voyages by sailing with the [[Canary Current]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryne, Linn. [https://web.archive.org/web/20081221173610/http://www.norway.org/history/expolorers/heyerdahl/heyerdahl.htm]. Retrieved January 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ra II'' is now in the [[Kon-Tiki Museum]] in [[Oslo]], Norway.

The book ''The Ra Expeditions'' and the film documentary ''[[Ra (1972 film)|Ra]]'' (1972) were made about the voyages. Apart from the primary aspects of the expedition, Heyerdahl deliberately selected a crew representing a great diversity in [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[nationality]], [[religion]] and political viewpoint in order to demonstrate that at least on their own little floating island, people could cooperate and live peacefully. Additionally, the expedition took samples of [[marine pollution]] and presented their report to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="HeyerdahlAward"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rederi.no/nrweb/cms.nsf/pages/heyerdahl-award.html | title = Heyerdahl award | publisher = [[Norwegian Shipowners' Association|Norges Rederiforbund]] | accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Tigris''==
[[File:Tigris Model Pyramids of Guimar.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Model of the ''Tigris'' at the [[Pyramids of Güímar]], [[Tenerife]].]]
Heyerdahl built yet another [[reed boat]], ''Tigris'', which was intended to demonstrate that trade and migration could have linked [[Mesopotamia]] with the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in what is now Pakistan and western India. Tigris was built in Iraq and sailed with its international crew through the Persian Gulf to Pakistan and made its way into the Red Sea. After about five months at sea and still remaining seaworthy, the ''Tigris'' was deliberately burnt in [[Djibouti]], on April 3, 1978, as a protest against the wars raging on every side in the [[Red Sea]] and [[Horn of Africa]]. In his Open Letter to the UN Secretary-General [[Kurt Waldheim]], Heyerdahl explained his reasons:&lt;ref&gt;Heyerdahl, Betty Blair, Bjornar Storfjell, [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai111_folder/111_articles/111_heyerdahl_tigris.html "25 Years Ago, Heyerdahl Burns Tigris Reed Ship to Protest War,"] in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 11:1 (Spring 2003), pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today we burn our proud ship&amp;nbsp;... to protest against inhuman elements in the world of 1978&amp;nbsp;... Now we are forced to stop at the entrance to the Red Sea. Surrounded by military airplanes and warships from the world's most civilized and developed nations, we have been denied permission by friendly governments, for reasons of security, to land anywhere, but in the tiny, and still neutral, Republic of Djibouti. Elsewhere around us, brothers and neighbors are engaged in homicide with means made available to them by those who lead humanity on our joint road into the third millennium.

To the innocent masses in all industrialized countries, we direct our appeal. We must wake up to the insane reality of our time&amp;nbsp;... We are all irresponsible, unless we demand from the responsible decision makers that modern armaments must no longer be made available to people whose former battle axes and swords our ancestors condemned.

Our planet is bigger than the reed bundles that have carried us across the seas, and yet small enough to run the same risks unless those of us still alive open our eyes and minds to the desperate need of intelligent collaboration to save ourselves and our common civilization from what we are about to convert into a sinking ship.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the years that followed, Heyerdahl was often outspoken on issues of international peace and the environment.

The ''Tigris'' had an eleven-man crew: Thor Heyerdahl (Norway), [[Norman Baker (explorer)|Norman Baker]] (USA), [[Carlo Mauri]] (Italy), [[Yuri Senkevich]] (USSR), Germán Carrasco (Mexico), Hans Petter Bohn (Norway), Rashad Nazar Salim (Iraq), Norris Brock (USA), Toru Suzuki (Japan), Detlef Soitzek (Germany), and Asbjørn Damhus (Denmark).

=="The Search for Odin" in Azerbaijan and Russia==
[[File:Bust of Thor Heyerdahl in Kish village of Azerbaijan.jpg|thumbnail|Bust of Thor Heyerdahl in [[Kiş, Shaki|Kish village]] of [[Azerbaijan]] (opposite the [[Church of Kish|church]])]]
Heyerdahl made four visits to [[Azerbaijan]] in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;Forecoming 2014: Thor Heyerdahl and Azerbaijan, to be published jointly by University of Oslo and Azerbaijan University of Languages, Editor Vibeke Roeggen et al.&lt;/ref&gt; 1994, 1999 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/31_folder/31_articles/31_thorheyerdahl.html |title=Thor Heyerdahl in Azerbaijan |publisher=Azer.com |date= |accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heyerdahl had long been fascinated with the rock carvings that date back to about 8th-7th millennia BCE at [[Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape|Gobustan]] (about 30 miles/48&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Baku]]). He was convinced that their artistic style closely resembled the carvings found in his native Norway. The ship designs, in particular, were regarded by Heyerdahl as similar and drawn with a simple sickle-shaped line, representing the base of the boat, with vertical lines on deck, illustrating crew or, perhaps, raised oars.

Based on this and other published documentation, Heyerdahl proposed that Azerbaijan was the site of an ancient advanced civilization. He believed that natives migrated north through waterways to present-day [[Scandinavia]] using ingeniously constructed vessels made of skins that could be folded like cloth. When voyagers travelled upstream, they conveniently folded their skin boats and transported them on pack animals.

On Heyerdahl's visit to Baku in 1999, he lectured at the [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] about the history of ancient Nordic Kings. He spoke of a notation made by [[Snorri Sturluson]], a 13th-century historian-mythographer in ''[[Ynglinga Saga]]'', which relates that "[[Odin]] (a Scandinavian god who was one of the kings) came to the North with his people from a country called [[Æsir|Aser]]."&lt;ref&gt;Stenersens, J. (trans.) (1987). ''Snorri, The Sagas of the Viking Kings of Norway''. Oslo: Forlag, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[House of Yngling]]s and [[Mythological kings of Sweden]]). Heyerdahl accepted Snorri's story as literal truth, and believed that a chieftain led his people in a migration from the east, westward and northward through [[Saxony]], to [[Fyn]] in [[Denmark]], and eventually settling in [[Sweden]]. Heyerdahl claimed that the geographic location of the mythic Aser or Æsir matched the region of contemporary Azerbaijan&amp;nbsp;– "east of the Caucasus mountains and the Black Sea". "We are no longer talking about mythology," Heyerdahl said, "but of the realities of [[geography]] and [[history]]. [[Azerbaijanis]] should be proud of their ancient culture. It is just as rich and ancient as that of [[China]] and [[Mesopotamia]]."

In September 2000, Heyerdahl returned to Baku for the fourth time and visited the archaeological dig in the area of the [[Church of Kish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/84_folder/84_articles/84_kish.html|title=8.4 The Kish Church - Digging Up History - An Interview with J. Bjornar Storfjell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the last projects of his life, ''[[Jakten på Odin]]'', 'The Search for Odin', was a sudden revision of his Odin hypothesis, in furtherance of which he initiated 2001–2002 excavations in [[Azov]], [[Russia]], near the [[Sea of Azov]] at the northeast of the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref name="Storfjell"&gt;Storfjell, "[http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai102_folder/102_articles/102_heyerdahl_storfjell.html Thor Heyerdahl's Final Projects]," in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 10:2 (Summer 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; He searched for the remains of a civilization to match the account of Odin in Snorri Sturlusson, quite a bit north of his original target of Azerbaijan on the [[Caspian Sea]] only two years earlier. This project generated harsh criticism and accusations of pseudoscience from historians, archaeologists and linguists in Norway, who accused Heyerdahl of selective use of sources, and a basic lack of scientific methodology in his work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Even Hovdhaugen]], Christian Keller, Else Mundal, Anne Stalsberg, Gro Steinsland: Anmeldelse av Thor Heyerdahl og Per Lillieström: Jakten på Odin.

His central claims were based on similarities of names in Norse mythology and geographic names in the Black Sea region, e.g. ''Azov'' and ''Æsir'', [[Udi people|Udi]] and Odin, [[Tyr]] and [[Turkey]]. Philologists and historians reject these parallels as mere coincidences, and also anachronisms, for instance the city of Azov did not have that name until over 1000 years after Heyerdahl claims the Æsir dwelt there. The controversy surrounding the Search for Odin project was in many ways typical of the relationship between Heyerdahl and the academic community. His theories rarely won any scientific acceptance, whereas Heyerdahl himself rejected all scientific criticism and concentrated on publishing his theories in popular books aimed at the general public.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

{{As of|2017}}, Heyerdahl's Odin hypothesis has yet to be validated by any historian, archaeologist or linguist.

==Other projects==
Heyerdahl also investigated the mounds found on the [[Maldive Islands]] in the Indian Ocean. There, he found sun-oriented foundations and courtyards, as well as statues with elongated earlobes. Heyerdahl believed that these finds fit with his theory of a seafaring civilization which originated in what is now [[Sri Lanka]], colonized the [[Maldives]], and influenced or founded the cultures of ancient South America and Easter Island. His discoveries are detailed in his book ''The Maldive Mystery''.

In 1991, he studied the [[Pyramids of Güímar]] on [[Tenerife]] and declared that they were not random stone heaps but pyramids. Based on the discovery made by the astrophysicists Aparicio, Belmonte and Esteban, from the [[Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias]] that the "pyramids" were astronomically oriented and being convinced that they were of ancient origin, he claimed that the ancient people who built them were most likely sun worshippers. Heyerdahl advanced a theory according to which [[Canary Islands|the Canaries]] had been bases of ancient shipping between America and the [[Mediterranean]].

Heyerdahl was also an active figure in [[Green politics]]. He was the recipient of numerous medals and awards. He also received 11 [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorates]] from universities in the [[Americas]] and [[Europe]].

==Death==
[[File:Thor Heyerdahl tomb.jpg|thumb|Thor Heyerdahl's tomb at [[Colla Micheri]]]]
In subsequent years, Heyerdahl was involved with many other expeditions and archaeological projects. He remained best known for his boat-building, and for his emphasis on cultural [[diffusion (anthropology)|diffusionism]]. He died, aged 87, from a [[Brain tumor|brain tumour]]. After receiving the diagnosis he prepared for dying by [[Apocarteresis|refusing to eat]] or take medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Since then, they have purchased and renovated Heyerdahl's childhood home, arranged a yearly raft regatta in his honour at the end of summer and begun to develop a Heyerdahl centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{nb icon}} [http://www.op.no/heyerdahl/ Heyerdahl-byen]. op.no. Retrieved on March 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Paul Theroux]], in his book ''The Happy Isles of Oceania'', criticizes Heyerdahl for trying to link the culture of Polynesian islands with the Peruvian culture. However, recent scientific investigation that compares the DNA of some of the Polynesian islands with natives from Peru suggests that there is some merit to Heyerdahl's ideas and that while Polynesia was colonized from Asia, some contact with South America also existed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thorsby | first1 = E. | last2 = Flåm | first2 = S.

A '''Tranchet axe''' is a [[Stone tool|lithic]] tool made by removing a [[lithic flake|flake]], known, when using this method, as a [[tranchet flake]], parallel to the final intended cutting edge of the tool which creates a single straight edge as wide as the tool itself. It is found in some [[Acheulean]] [[Assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]]s as well as in [[Mesolithic]] flaked stone industries.

The '''Zayit Stone''' is a {{Convert|38|lb}} limestone boulder discovered on 15 July 2005 at [[Tel Zayit]] (Zeitah) in the Guvrin Valley, about 50&amp;nbsp;km (35 miles) southwest of [[Jerusalem]]. The boulder measures 37.5&amp;nbsp;cm × 27&amp;nbsp;cm × 15.7&amp;nbsp;cm high and was embedded in the stone wall of a building. Although some scholars consider the text to be written in the [[Phoenician alphabet]],{{sfn|Rollston|2008}} it is frequently considered to be the earliest known example of the complete [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]. The flat side of the boulder is inscribed with a complete [[abecedarium|abecedary]], although in a different order to the traditional version.&lt;ref&gt;Tappy p.344&lt;/ref&gt; The first line contains eighteen letters (''aleph'' through ''tsadi''), while the second contains the remaining four letters (''qoph'' through ''tav'') followed by two enigmatic zigzag symbols.

== Description ==
One side of the stone  carries the Paleo-Hebrew abecedary extending over two lines:

*Line 1:
:[[File:Early Aramaic character - tzadi.png|30px|Tzadi]][[File:Early Aramaic character - pey.png|30px|Pey]][[File:Early Aramaic character - ayin.png|30px|Ayin]][[File:Early Aramaic character - samekh.png|30px|Samekh]][[File:Early Aramaic character - nun.png|30px|Nun]][[File:Early Aramaic character - mem.png|30px|Mem]][[File:Early Aramaic character - khof.png|30px|Khof]][[File:Early Aramaic character - lamed.png|30px|Lamed]][[File:Early Aramaic character - yud.png|30px|Yud]][[File:Early Aramaic character - tet.png|30px|Tet]][[File:Early Aramaic character - zayin.png|30px|Zayin]][[File:Early Aramaic character - khet.png|30px|Khet]][[File:Early Aramaic character - heh.png|30px|Heh]][[File:Early Aramaic character - vav.png|30px|Vav]][[File:Early Aramaic character - daled.png|30px|Daled]][[File:Early Aramaic character - gimmel.png|30px|Gimel]][[File:Early Aramaic character - Beth.png|30px|Bet]][[File:Early Aramaic character - Alaph.png|30px|Aleph]]
* Line 2:
:&lt;big&gt;|&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;|&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/big&gt;[[File:Early Aramaic character - tof.png|30px|Tof]][[File:Early Aramaic character - shin.png|30px|Shin]][[File:Early Aramaic character - resh.png|30px|Resh]][[File:Early Aramaic character - quf.png|30px|Quf]]

In modern [[Hebrew alphabet]], the letters are:
*Line 1:
:&lt;big&gt;{{Hebrew| א ב ג ד ו ה ח ז ט י ל כ מ נ ס ע פ צ}}&lt;/big&gt;
*Line 2:
:&lt;big&gt;|&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;|&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {{Hebrew| ק ר ש ת}}&lt;/big&gt;


There is some debate over whether the forms of these letters are anticipatory of later developments in Hebrew and should thus be characterized as "Palaeo-Hebrew" or whether they lack such features and should be characterized as "Phoenician" or more generally "South Canaanite."&lt;ref&gt;For an introduction to difficulties of labeling this script, see {{harvp|McCarter|2008}} and {{harvp|Rollston|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The side opposite this inscription has a bowl-shaped depression measuring 18.5&amp;nbsp;cm × 14.5&amp;nbsp;cm × 6.7&amp;nbsp;cm deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tappy|McCarter|Lundberg|Zuckerman|2006|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar ground stone objects have been recovered at Tel Zayit. Their function is uncertain, but "they may have served as mortars, door sockets, or basins of some kind."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tappy|McCarter|Lundberg|Zuckerman|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very top line of the inscription contain the letters:

:[[File:Early Aramaic character - resh.png|26x26px]][[File:Early Aramaic character - zayin.png|25x25px]][[File:Early Aramaic character - ayin.png|30x30px]]

In the modern [[Hebrew alphabet]] this translates to {{Hebrew|עזר}}, transliterated '''ʿzr'''. The word עזר (''‘ōzêr'') is mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]] many times and depending on the verse, it either translates to, "Help" or "Helper". For example: "Hear, O Lord, and be gracious to me; Lord, be my helper" (Psalms 30:11), "And I looked, and there was none to help" (Isaiah 63:5).

== History ==
The stone was discovered on July 15, 2005 by volunteer excavator, Dan Rypma,&lt;ref name="Tappy_etal_42"&gt;{{harvp|Tappy|McCarter|Lundberg|Zuckerman|2006|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; during excavations under the direction of Ron E. Tappy of [[Pittsburgh Theological Seminary]] at [[Tel Zayit]] as part of the archeological excavations which took place during the 1999–2001, 2005, 2007, and 2009–2011 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tappy|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tappy|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription was discovered ''[[in situ]]'' in what appears to be a tertiary usage as part of wall 2307/2389 in square O19.&lt;ref&gt;In the ''editio princeps'', the authors write that "the utilization of the Tel Zayit stone as a writing surface seems likely to have been secondary to its original purpose, so that the subsequent appropriation of the inscribed boulder as a building block might be described as tertiary" {{harv|Tappy|McCarter|Lundberg|Zuckerman|2006|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Gezer calendar]], the abecedary is an important witness to the letter forms in use in the Levant in the early Iron Age.

== Significance ==
Several inferences may be drawn from its content and context:

* The authors of the ''editio princeps'' support the conclusion that given "the well-established archaeo-palaeographic chronology of the Tel Zayit inscription... and the clear cultural affiliation of its archaeological context with the Judaean highlands, we may reasonably associate it with the nascent kingdom of Judah."&lt;ref name="Tappy_etal_42"/&gt; It should be noted, however, that this interpretation has been challenged on both palaeographic&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rollston|2008|pp=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and archaeological&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Finkelstein|Sass|Singer-Avitz|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; grounds.
* The Tel Zayit abecedary adds to the corpus of inland Canaanite alphabetic inscriptions from the early Iron Age and thus provides additional evidence for literacy in the region during this period. While claiming a certain "level" or "percentage" of literacy on the basis of this and similar inscriptions is notoriously difficult, one might argue, as one recent contributor to the discussion, that because "Tel Zayit is... small enough and distant enough from Jerusalem... the presence of this inscription there might be taken as testimony of more widespread writing across more far-flung and minor administrative centers of Judah."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Carr|2008|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In addition to preserving writing as such, the inscription preserves an ordered sequence of letters, though this differs at points from those of other abecedaries from the Late Bronze and Iron Age Levant.&lt;ref&gt;For a useful chart, see {{harvp|Sanders|2008|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, ''waw'' is placed before ''he'', ''het'' is placed before ''zayin'', and ''lamed'' is placed before ''kaph''. In this last instance, a large X appears to mark a mistake realized by the scribe himself. This may indicate that the author was poorly educated or that the alphabetic order had yet to fully stabilize.
* The text may have played a significant role in making "an important symbolic statement for the cultural core that lay in the highlands to the east."&lt;ref name="Tappy_2008_37"&gt;{{harvp|Tappy|2008|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is true "regardless of which cultural set [i.e. coastal Phoenician or highland Hebrew] one sees as the sponsor of the inscription."&lt;ref name="Tappy_2008_37"/&gt;

In addition to the above broad historical concerns, the inscription is significant primarily due to the light it sheds on the development of letter forms in the southern Canaanite interior of the early Iron Age. Because the stratigraphy of the site and the date of the inscription itself are still debated, it is nevertheless difficult given the present state of research to attach any definite historical or chronologically absolute conclusions to the inscription's existence or content.&lt;ref&gt;See especially {{harvp|Finkelstein|Sass|Singer-Avitz|2008}}, to which {{harvp|Tappy|2011}} is a response.&lt;/ref&gt;
