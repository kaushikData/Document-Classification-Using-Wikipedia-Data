The '''509th Composite Group''' ('''509 CG''') was a unit of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] created during World War II and tasked with the operational deployment of [[nuclear weapon]]s. It conducted the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], Japan, in August 1945.

The group was activated on 17 December 1944 at [[Wendover Army Air Field]], [[Utah]]. It was commanded by [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Paul W. Tibbets]]. Because it contained flying squadrons equipped with [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] [[bomber]]s,  [[C-47 Skytrain]], and [[C-54 Skymaster]] [[military transport aircraft|transport aircraft]], the group was designated as a "composite", rather than a "bombardment" formation. It operated [[Silverplate]] B-29s, which were specially configured to enable them to carry nuclear weapons.

The 509th Composite Group began deploying to [[North Field (Tinian)|North Field]] on [[Tinian]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], in May 1945. In addition to the two nuclear bombing raids, it carried out 15 practice missions against Japanese-held islands, and 12 combat missions against targets in Japan dropping high-explosive [[pumpkin bomb]]s.

In the postwar era, the 509th Composite Group was one of the original ten bombardment groups assigned to [[Strategic Air Command]] on 21 March 1946 and the only one equipped with ''Silverplate'' B-29 Superfortress aircraft capable of delivering atomic bombs. It was standardized as a [[bombardment group]] and redesignated the [[509th Operations Group|509th Bombardment Group, Very Heavy]], on 10 July 1946.

==History==
===Organization, training, and security===
[[File:1st Ordnance Squadron.jpg|thumb|right|First Ordnance Squadron area on Tinian|alt=Five semi-cylinder shaped huts]]
The 509th Composite Group was constituted on 9 December 1944, and activated on 17 December 1944, at [[Wendover Army Air Field]], Utah. It was commanded by [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]]  [[Paul W. Tibbets]],&lt;ref name="History, pp. 1-3"&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', pp.&amp;nbsp;1–3&lt;/ref&gt; who received promotion to full [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in January 1945.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=165}} It was initially assumed that the group would divide in two, with half going to Europe and half to the Pacific.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=185}}  In the first week of September Tibbets was assigned to organize a [[bombardment group|combat group]] to develop the means of delivering an atomic weapon by airplane against targets in Germany and Japan, then command it in combat.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=158–163}}  Because the organization developed by Tibbets was self-sustained, with flying squadrons of both [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] bombers and transport aircraft, the group was designated as a "composite" rather than a "bombardment" unit.&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', pp. a, 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September, working with [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]]'s [[Manhattan Project]], Tibbets selected Wendover for his training base over [[Great Bend Army Air Field]], Kansas, and [[Mountain Home Army Airfield]], Idaho, because of its remoteness.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=163, 167–168}} On 14 September 1944,{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=110}} the [[393d Bombardment Squadron]] arrived at Wendover from its former base at [[Fairmont Army Air Base]], [[Nebraska]], where it had been in operational training (OTU) with the [[504th Bombardment Group]] since 12 March.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=97}}{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=110}} When its parent group deployed to the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] in early November 1944, the squadron was assigned directly to the [[Second Air Force]] until creation of the 509th Composite Group.&lt;ref name="393rdOH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=11997 |title=393d Bomb Squadron |publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA) |accessdate=29 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914053846/http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=11997 |archivedate=14 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally consisting of twenty-one crews, fifteen were selected to continue training,{{sfn|Krauss|Krauss|2005|p=1}} and were organized into three [[flight (military unit)|flights]] of five crews, lettered A, B, and C.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=25–26}} The 393d Bombardment Squadron was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas J. Classen, who like Tibbets had combat experience in heavy bombers, commanding a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] with the [[11th Wing|11th Bombardment Group]].&lt;ref name="History, pp. 1-3"/&gt;

The 393d Bombardment Squadron conducted ground school training only until delivery of three modified ''Silverplate'' airplanes in mid-October 1944 allowed resumption of flight training.&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; These aircraft had extensive bomb bay modifications and a "weaponeer" station installed. Initial training operations identified numerous other modifications necessary to the mission, particularly in reducing the overall weight of the airplane to offset the heavy loads it would be required to carry. Five more ''Silverplate''s were delivered in November and six in December, giving the group 14 for its training operations. In January and February 1945, 10 of the 15 crews under the command of the Group S-3 (operations officer) were assigned temporary duty at [[Batista Field]], [[San Antonio de los Baños, Cuba]], where they trained in long-range over-water navigation.&lt;ref name="uwash"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/earns/olivi.html| title = Reflections From Above: An American pilot's perspective on the mission which dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki| publisher=University of Washington| accessdate =30 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[320th Troop Carrier Squadron]], the other flying unit of the 509th, came into being because of the highly secret work of the group. The organization that was to become the 509th required its own transports for the movement of both personnel and materiel, resulting in creation of an ad hoc unit nicknamed "The [[Green Hornet]] Line".&lt;ref name="509timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mphpa.org/classic/CG/CG_09C.htm| title = 509th Timeline: Inception to Hiroshima| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate =5 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crews for this unit were acquired from the five 393d crews not selected to continue B-29 training. All those qualified for positions with the 320th chose to remain with the 509th rather than be assigned to a replacement pool of the Second Air Force.{{sfn|Krauss|Krauss|2005|p=1}} They began using [[C-46 Commando]] and [[C-47 Skytrain]]s already at Wendover, and in November 1944 acquired three [[C-54 Skymaster]]s. The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron originally consisted of three C-54 and four C-47 aircraft.  In April 1945 the C-47s were transferred to the [[216th Army Air Forces Base Unit]] and two additional C-54s acquired.&lt;ref&gt;The five C-54 Skymasters were 42-72594, 42-72605, 44–9007, 44–9009, and 44-9019. {{cite web |url=http://forum.armyairforces.com/m/tm.aspx?m=219200&amp;fp=2 |title=320th TCS, 509th CG, 216th AAFBU (Sp) |accessdate=31 August 2013 |publisher=forum.armyairforces.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001800/http://forum.armyairforces.com/m/tm.aspx?m=219200&amp;fp=2 |archivedate=31 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afhra.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/080125-f-3927s-011.jpg |title=42-72605 AFHRA archive |accessdate=18 May 2013 |publisher=United States Air Force |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315184109/http://www.afhra.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/080125-f-3927s-011.jpg |archivedate=15 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afhra.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/080125-f-3927s-008.jpg |title=44-9007 AFHRA archive |accessdate=18 May 2005 |publisher=United States Air Force |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315184157/http://www.afhra.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/080125-f-3927s-008.jpg |archivedate=15 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron was constituted and activated on the same dates as the group.&lt;ref name="History, pp. 1-3"/&gt;

Other support units were activated at Wendover from personnel already present and working with [[Project Alberta]] or in the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit, both affiliated with the Manhattan project.&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Project Alberta was the part of the Manhattan Project at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory#The Manhattan Project|Site Y]] in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]] responsible for the preparation and delivery of the nuclear weapons. It was commanded by U.S. Navy [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William S. Parsons]], who would accompany the Hiroshima mission as weaponeer.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=25, 155–158}} On 6 March 1945, concurrent with the activation of Project Alberta, the 1st Ordnance Squadron, Special (Aviation) was activated at Wendover, again using Army Air Forces personnel on hand or already at Los Alamos. Its purpose was to provide "skilled machinists, welders and munitions workers"&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and special equipment to the group to enable it to assemble atomic weapons at its operating base, thereby allowing the weapons to be transported more safely in their component parts. A rigorous candidate selection process was used to recruit personnel, reportedly with an 80% "washout" rate. Not until May 1945 did the 509th Composite Group reach full strength.&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Commander Ashworth.jpg|thumb|right|Commander Ashworth in the First Ordnance Squadron Area|alt=An office with desksm chairs and boxes inside a semi-cylindrical corrugated iron building.]]
The 390th Air Service Group was created as the command echelon for the 603rd Air Engineering Squadron, the 1027th Air Material Squadron, and its own Headquarters and Base Services Squadron, but when these units became independent operationally, it acted as the basic support unit for the entire 509th Composite Group in providing quarters, rations, medical care, postal service and other functions. The 603rd Air Engineering Squadron was unique in that it provided depot-level B-29 maintenance in the field, obviating the necessity of sending aircraft back to the United States for major repairs. On Tinian the 603rd Air Engineering Squadron was assigned to the 313th Bombardment Wing's "C" and "D" Service Centers, where it performed provided depot-level ("third echelon") maintenance for the entire 313th Bombardment Wing when it was not engaged in 509th activities.  The 393d Bombardment Squadron's maintenance section was re-organized as a "combat line maintenance" section (also called PLM, or "production line maintenance," a technique developed by the [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] in India for [[The Hump|"Hump"]] aircraft) to maximize use of personnel for first and second echelon maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', pp.&amp;nbsp;34–35&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=97}}

===Overseas movement===
With the addition of the 1st Ordnance Squadron to its roster, the 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom deployed to Tinian. The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron kept its base of operations at Wendover. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian 51 civilian and military personnel of Project Alberta, and two representatives from Washington, D.C.,{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=25}} the deputy director of the Manhattan Project, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Thomas Farrell (general)|Thomas Farrell]], and [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] William R. Purnell of the [[Military Policy Committee]].{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=100}}

Two anecdotes illustrate the level of security affecting the 509th's personnel and equipment. En route to Tinian on 4 June 1945, the B-29 that became ''The Great Artiste'' made an intermediate stop at [[Mather Air Force Base|Mather Field]], near [[Sacramento, California]]. The commanding general of the base allegedly attempted to enter the aircraft to inspect it and was warned by a plane guard who aimed his [[M1 carbine|carbine]] at the general's chest that he could not do so.&lt;ref name="gun"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mphpa.org/classic/CG/CG_09A.htm| title = Mather AFB Incident| publisher=MPHPA| accessdate =20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar incident occurred to a Project Alberta courier, 2nd Lieutenant William A. King. King was escorting the [[plutonium]] [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|core]] of the [[Fat Man]] implosion bomb to Tinian, strapped to the floor of one of the 509th's C-54s. On 26 July 1945 it made a refueling stop at [[Hickam Field]], Hawaii. The commander of a combat unit returning to the United States learned that the Skymaster had only one passenger and attempted to enter the C-54 to requisition it as transport for his men. He was prevented from doing so by King, who aimed a [[M1911 pistol|.45 caliber automatic pistol]] at the colonel.&lt;ref name="gun2"&gt;{{cite journal | quote = | year = 2004 | title = Nagasaki Bomb Core Courier| journal=The Purple and Gold: Journal of Psi Chi Fraternity | volume = 122 | issue = 3| pages =10–11  | url = http://www.chipsi.org/resource/resmgr/png_stuff/ww2story.pdf| accessdate =20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 509th transferred four of its 14 training ''Silverplate'' B-29s to the 216th AAF Base Unit in February 1945.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=44}} In April the third modification increment of ''Silverplate''s, which would be their combat aircraft, began coming off the Martin-Omaha assembly line. These "fly-away" aircraft were equipped with [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] engines, Curtiss Electric [[Reverse thrust|reversible-pitch]] [[propeller]]s, pneumatic actuators for rapid opening and closing of bomb bay doors and other improvements.&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=14–15}} The remaining 17 ''Silverplate'' B-29s were placed in storage.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=22}} Each bombardier completed at least 50 practice drops of inert [[pumpkin bomb]]s before Tibbets declared his group combat-ready.&lt;ref name="ready"&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/9.pdf|format=PDF| title = Minutes of 3rd Target Committee Meeting 28 May 1945| publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] | accessdate =9 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060809093247/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/9.pdf| archivedate= 9 August 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground support echelon of the 509th Composite Group, consisting of 44 officers and 815 enlisted men commanded by Major George W. Westcott of the Headquarters Squadron,&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  received movement orders and moved by rail on 26 April 1945 to its port of embarkation at [[Seattle]], Washington. On 6 May the support elements sailed on the ''SS Cape Victory'' for the Marianas, while group materiel was shipped on the SS ''Emile Berliner''. The ''Cape Victory'' made brief port calls at [[Honolulu]] and [[Eniwetok]] but the passengers were not permitted to leave the dock area.&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', pp.&amp;nbsp;17–18&lt;/ref&gt;  An advance party of the air echelon, consisting of 29 officers and 61 enlisted men commanded by Group Intelligence Officer (S-2) Lieutenant Colonel Hazen Payette, flew by C-54 to [[North Field (Tinian)|North Field, Tinian]], between 15 and 22 May.&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', pp.&amp;nbsp;19–22&lt;/ref&gt;   It was joined by the ground echelon on 29 May 1945, marking the group's official change of station.&lt;ref name="Children of the Manhattan Project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrenofthemanhattanproject.org/CG/CG_09C.htm |title=Timeline #1 – The 509th; From Inception to Hiroshima |publisher=Children of the Manhattan Project |accessdate=26 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617223231/http://childrenofthemanhattanproject.org/CG/CG_09C.htm |archivedate=17 June 2006 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Project Alberta's "Destination Team" also sent most of its members to Tinian to supervise the assembly, loading, and dropping of the bombs under the administrative title of 1st Technical Services Detachment, Miscellaneous War Department Group.&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="comp1tsd"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mphpa.org/classic/HISTORY/H-07a2.htm| title = 509th CG Activation and Organization| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate =5 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The air echelon consisted of the members of the 393d Bombardment Squadron.  The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron remained at Wendover.&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  It began deploying from Wendover 4 June 1945, with the first B-29 arriving at North Field on 11 June. The group was assigned to the [[313th Air Division|313th Bombardment Wing]], whose four groups had been flying missions against Japan since mid-February, but for security reasons their permanent base area was near the runways on the island's north tip, several miles away from the main installations in the center of Tinian.&lt;ref name="509timeline"/&gt; The 509th, after spending most of June in an area previously occupied by the [[Seabees in World War II|Seabees]] of the 18th Naval Construction Battalion, took over the 13th Naval Construction Battalion Area just west of North Field's Runway D, a self-contained base with 89 [[Quonset hut]]s, a huge storage warehouse, a consolidated mess hall, chapel, administrative area, theater, and other amenities.&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', pp.&amp;nbsp;41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Each crew was required to attend the 313th Bombardment Wing's week-long "Lead Crew Ground School" on its arrival. The ground school indoctrinated combat crews in procedures regarding [[air-sea rescue]], ditching and bailouts, survival, radar bombing, weather, wing and air force regulations, emergency procedures, camera operation, dinghy drills, and other topics related to combat operations.&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of the group's bombers were not delivered by Martin-Omaha until early July. They remained at Wendover until 27 July to act as transports for two of the Fat Man assemblies.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=194, 196}}

Because of their geographical isolation from the combat crews of other groups, rigidly enforced security measures, and exclusion from participation in regular bombing missions, crews of the 393d Bombardment Squadron were resented and ridiculed as "lacking in discipline" and having a "soft life".{{sfn|Wainstock|1996|p=82}} The official history of the Army Air Forces characterized the ridicule as "epitomized in a satirical verse entitled ''Nobody Knows'', with a recurring refrain, 'For the 509th is winning the war.'"{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=707–708}}

The group was assigned [[Unit identification aircraft markings#XXI Bomber Command|tail markings]] of a circle outline (denoting the 313th Wing) around an [[arrowhead]] pointing forward, but at the beginning of August its B-29s were repainted with the tail markings of other XXI Bomber Command groups as a security measure, because it was feared that Japanese survivors on Tinian were reporting the 509th's activities to Tokyo by clandestine radio. The Victor (identification assigned by the squadron) numbers previously assigned the 393d aircraft were changed to avoid confusion with B-29s of the groups from whom the tail identifiers were borrowed.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=219}} Victor numbers 82, 89, 90, and 91 (including the ''[[Enola Gay]]'') carried the markings of the [[6th Operations Group|6th Bombardment Group]] (Circle R); Victors 71, 72, 73, and 84 those of the [[497th Air Refueling Wing|497th Bombardment Group]] (large "A"); Victors 77, 85, 86, and 88 those of the [[444th Bombardment Group]] (triangle N); and Victors 83, 94, and 95 those of the [[39th Air Base Wing|39th Bombardment Group]] (square P).{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=19}}

&lt;small&gt;* These airplane commanders and crews exchanged aircraft assignments on 9 August 1945 &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
Although all of the B-29s were named as shown, the only [[nose art]] applied to the aircraft before the atomic bomb missions was that of ''Enola Gay''.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=18}} With the exceptions of Victors 71 and 94, the others were applied some time in August 1945. ''Luke the Spook'' was not named until November 1945, and it is not known if nose art was ever applied to ''Jabit III''.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=195, 222}}

===Combat operations===
After ground training for the combat crews, the 509th began operations on 30 June 1945, with a calibration flight involving nine of the B-29s on hand. During the month of July and the first eight days of August the thirteen bombers of the 393d Bombardment Squadron flew an intensive training and mission rehearsal program that consisted of:
* 17 individual training sorties without ordnance,
* 15 practice bombing missions between 1 and 22 July against airfields on Japanese-held [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]], [[Marcus Island|Marcus]], [[Rota (island)|Rota]], and [[Guguan]] in which 90 B-29 [[sortie]]s dropped 500- and 1000-pound bombs to practice radar and visual bombing procedures,{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=71}}
* 12 combat missions between 20 and 29 July against targets in Japan dropping high-explosive pumpkin bombs, in which 37 B-29 sorties delivered conventional-bomb replications of the Fat Man:{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=27}} four on 20 July, three on 24 July, two on 26 July, and three on 29 July. Some 27 sorties were made visually and 10 by radar, striking 17 primary targets, 15 secondary targets, and five targets of opportunity. Two other aircraft did not drop their bombs: one jettisoned its pumpkin bomb into the sea near Iwo Jima, and the ''Strange Cargo'''s bomb came loose from the bomb rack and plunged through the closed bomb bay doors while the bomber was still on the ground. One B-29 incurred minor battle damage in the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', pp.&amp;nbsp;58–62&lt;/ref&gt; Flying at {{convert|30000|ft}} put them above the effective range of flak.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=175}} Each pumpkin bomb mission was conducted by a formation of three aircraft in the hope of convincing the Japanese military that small groups of B-29s did not justify a strong response. This strategy proved successful, and Japanese fighters only occasionally attempted to intercept the 509th Composite Group's aircraft.{{sfn|Polmar|2004|pp=24–25}}
* 7 component-tests between 23 July and 8 August involving rehearsal drops of four inert [[Little Boy]] [[gun-type fission weapon]]s and three Fat Man assemblies,{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=46}} and
* a practice mission on 29 July to [[Iwo Jima]] in which an inert Little Boy was unloaded and then reloaded to rehearse the contingency plan for using a back-up bomber in an emergency.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=46}}&lt;ref name="Spitzer"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mphpa.org/classic/COLLECTIONS/CG-ASPI/01/Pages/CGP-ASPI-010.htm| title = Spitzer Personal Diary Page 10 (CGP-ASPI-010)| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate =9 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this training was taking place, the components of the first two atomic bombs were shipped to Tinian by various means. For the [[uranium]] bomb code-named "Little Boy", fissile components consisted of a cylindrical target and nine washer-like rings that made up the hollow cylinder projectile. When the bomb detonated, these would be brought together to create a cylindrical core.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=27}} The [[uranium-235]] projectile and bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left [[Hunters Point Naval Shipyard]], California, on 16 July aboard the [[cruiser]] {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}}, arriving 26 July.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=30}} The Little Boy pre-assemblies were designated L-1, L-2, L-3, L-4, L-5, L-6, L-7 and L-11. L-1, L-2, L-5 and L-6 were expended in test drops. L-6 was used in the Iwo Jima dress rehearsal on 29 July. This was repeated on 31 July, but this time L-6 was test dropped near Tinian by ''Enola Gay''. L-11 was the assembly used for the Hiroshima bomb.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=46, 80}}{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|pp=100–101}} On 26 July three C-54s of the 320th Troop Carrier Squadron left [[Kirtland Air Force Base|Kirtland Army Air Field]], each with three of the uranium-235 target rings, and landed at North Field on 28 July.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=38–40}}&lt;ref name="complb"&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://www.mphpa.org/classic/HISTORY/little_boy.htm| title = Little Boy| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate =4 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The components for the bomb code-named the Fat Man arrived by air the same day. The bomb's [[plutonium core]] (encased in its insertion capsule) and the [[urchin (detonator)|beryllium-polonium initiator]] were transported from Kirtland to Tinian by C-54 in the custody of Project Alberta couriers. Three Fat Man high explosive pre-assemblies designated F31, F32, and F33 were picked up at Kirtland on 28 July by three B-29s, two from the 509th and one from the 216th AAF Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving 2 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2005|p=40}} The War Department memo "Transportation of Critical Shipments" listing all the movements is reproduced.&lt;/ref&gt; The B-29s were ''[[Luke the Spook]]'' and ''[[Laggin' Dragon]]'' of the 509th, and 42-65386, a phase 3 ''Silverplate'' of the 216th AAF Base Unit. F33 was expended during the final rehearsal on 8 August, and F31 was the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. F32 presumably would have been used for a third attack or its rehearsal.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=38–40}}

The final item of preparation for the operation came on 29 July 1945. Orders for the attack were issued to [[General (United States)|General]] [[Carl Spaatz]] on 25 July under the signature of General [[Thomas T. Handy]], the acting [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], since  [[General of the Army]] [[George C. Marshall]] was at the [[Potsdam Conference]] with the President.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=691}} The order designated four targets: [[Hiroshima]], [[Kokura]], [[Niigata, Niigata|Niigata]], and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], and ordered the attack to be made "as soon as weather will permit after about 3 August."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2005|p=41}} reproduces the text of the order.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atomic bomb missions===
{{Main|Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki}}
The mission profile for both atomic missions called for weather scouts to precede the strike force by an hour, reporting weather conditions in code over each proposed target. The strike force consisted of a bombing aircraft, with the aircraft commander responsible for all decisions in reaching the target and the bomb commander (weaponeer) responsible for all decisions regarding dropping of the bomb; a blast instrumentation aircraft which would fly the wing of the strike aircraft and drop instruments by parachute into the target area; and a camera ship, which would also carry scientific observers. Each mission had an additional "spare" aircraft pre-positioned on Iwo Jima to take over carrying the bomb if the strike aircraft encountered mechanical problems. The six combat crews of the Hiroshima mission were briefed on their targets, operational flight data, and the effects of the bomb on 4 August 1945.  Their pre-mission briefing on 5 August, under the terms of [[Operations Order No. 35]], covered details on weather and air-sea rescue. The Order described the bomb to be used as "special".&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Special Mission 13, attacking Hiroshima, was flown as planned and executed without significant problems or diversion from plan. ''Enola Gay'' took off at 02:45, {{convert|7.5|lt|t}} overweight and near maximum gross weight. Arming of the bomb began eight minutes into the flight and took 25 minutes. The three target-area aircraft arrived over Iwo Jima approximately three hours into the mission and departed together at 06:07. The safeties on the bomb were removed at 07:30, 90 minutes before time over target, and 15 minutes later the B-29s began a climb to the {{convert|30000|ft|m|adj=on}} bombing altitude. The bomb run began at 09:12, with the drop three minutes later, after which the B-29s immediately performed steep diving turns. The detonation followed 45.5 seconds after the drop.  Primary and "echo" shock waves overtook the B-29s a minute following the blast, and the smoke cloud was visible to the crews for 90 minutes, by which time they were almost {{convert|400|mi|km}} away. ''Enola Gay'' returned to Tinian at 14:58.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/CG/CG_09C1.htm |title=Timeline #2 – The 509th; The Hiroshima Mission |publisher=Manhattan Project Heritage Preservation Association |accessdate=18 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special Mission 16 was moved up two days from 11 August because of adverse weather forecasts. Weather also dictated a change in rendezvous to [[Yakushima, Kagoshima|Yakushima]], much closer to the target, and an initial cruise altitude of {{convert|17000|ft|m}} instead of {{convert|9300|ft|m}}, both of which considerably increased fuel consumption.  Pre-flight inspection discovered an inoperative fuel transfer pump in the {{convert|625|usgal|l|adj=on}} aft bomb bay fuel tank, but a decision was made to continue anyway.  The plutonium bomb did not require arming in flight, but did have its safeties removed 30 minutes after the 03:45 takeoff (all times Tinian; Nagasaki times were one hour earlier) when ''Bockscar'' reached {{convert|5000|ft|m}} of altitude. When the daylight rendezvous point was reached at 09:10, the photo plane failed to appear.  The weather planes reported both targets within the required visual attack parameters while ''Bockscar'' circled Yakushima waiting for the photo plane. Finally the mission proceeded without the photo plane, thirty minutes behind schedule. When ''Bockscar'' arrived at Kokura 30 minutes later, cloud cover had increased to 70% of the area, and three bomb runs over the next 50 minutes were fruitless in bombing visually. The commanders decided to reduce power to conserve fuel and divert to Nagasaki, bombing by radar if necessary.  The bomb run began at 11:58. (two hours behind schedule) using radar; but the Fat Man was dropped visually when a hole opened in the clouds at 12:01. The photo plane arrived at Nagasaki in time to complete its mission, and the three aircraft diverted to Okinawa, where they arrived at 13:00.  Trying in vain for 20 minutes to contact the control tower at [[Yontan Airfield]] to obtain landing clearance, ''Bockscar'' nearly ran out of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/CG/CG_09C2.htm |title=Timeline #3 – The 509th; The Nagasaki Mission |publisher=Manhattan Project Heritage Preservation Association |accessdate=18 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Nagasaki mission was in progress, two B-29s of the 509th took off from Tinian to return to Wendover. The crews of Classen in the unnamed Victor 94, and Captain John A. Wilson in ''Jabit III'', together with ground support crews, were sent back to the United States to stage for the possibility of transporting further bomb pre-assemblies to Tinian.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=195}} Groves expected to have another atomic bomb ready for shipment on 13 August and use on 19 August, with three more available in September and a further three in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II, A Collection of Primary Sources| publisher=[[George Washington University]]| date = 13 August 1945| work=National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 162 | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/72.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groves ordered that all shipments of material be stopped on 13 August, when the third bomb was still at Site Y.&lt;ref group=n&gt;Tibbets, in a 1994 interview aired during the [[Smithsonian Networks]] program ''Smithsonian Channel's War Stories'' (1995, "The Men Who Brought the Dawn"), stated that a third bomb was available "at Wendover" and that "the bomb" had been transported as far as Mather Field when further missions were cancelled.  However, since plutonium cores and initiators were transported separately by courier from Los Alamos, it is likely that if any part of a bomb had been en route, it was only a bomb pre-assembly, possibly to have a second in place in addition to F32 and thus permit a rehearsal before any third mission. Sources familiar with Groves state categorically that even though physicist [[Robert Bacher|Robert F. Bacher]] had signed for receipt of the core and initiator, the order to halt shipment reached Los Alamos before the pit left the site. {{harvnb|Lawren|1988|p=253}}; {{harvnb|Campbell|2005|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post atomic bomb operations===
After each atomic mission the group conducted other combat operations, making a series of [[pumpkin bomb]] attacks on 8 and 14 August. Six B-29s visually attacked targets at Yokkaichi, Uwajima, Tsuruga, and Tokushima on 8 August, bombing two primary and three secondary targets with five bombs.  Seven aircraft visually attacked Koroma and Nagoya on 14 August. ''Some Punkins'' (Crew B-7, Price) is believed to have dropped the last bombs by the [[Twentieth Air Force]] in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;''History of 509th Composite Group'', pp&amp;nbsp;70–71, 74&lt;/ref&gt;  After the announcement of the Japanese surrender, the 509th Composite Group flew three further training missions involving 31 sorties on 18, 20 and 22 August, then stood down from operations. The group made a total of 210 operational sorties from 30 June to 22 August, aborted four additional flights, and had only a single aircraft fail to take off. Altogether, 140 sorties involved the dropping of live [[Aircraft ordnance|ordnance]].{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=26}} Some 60 flights were credited as combat missions: 49 pumpkin bomb and 11 atomic bomb sorties.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=104}}

Three B-29s (''Full House'', ''Straight Flush'', and ''Top Secret'') flew six combat missions each. Crews A-1 (Taylor) and C-11 (Eatherly) flew the most combat missions, six (including one atomic mission) each, while six other crews each flew five. Only the late arrivals (A-2 [Costello] and C-12 [Zahn]) did not participate in any combat missions, although Costello's B-29 was used by another crew for weather reconnaissance of Nagasaki on the second mission.  Including training and test flights, crews B-8 (McKnight) and C-13 (Bock) flew the most missions, with 20 total (5 combat). Crew B-7 (Price) is the only crew to fly all of its missions (18 total, 5 combat) in its normally assigned aircraft, ''Some Punkins''.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=113–115, 119}}

The 509th Composite Group returned to the United States on 6 November 1945, and was stationed at [[Roswell Army Airfield]], New Mexico.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=21}} Colonel [[William H. Blanchard]] replaced Tibbets as group commander on 22 January 1946, and also became the first commander of the [[509th Bombardment Wing]].{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=62}} It was one of the original ten bombardment groups assigned to [[Strategic Air Command]] when it was formed on 21 March 1946.{{sfn|Moody|1996|pp=78–79}} The [[715th Weapons Squadron|715th]] and [[830th Bombardment Squadron]]s were assigned to the 509th on 6 May 1946, and the group was redesignated the 509th Bombardment Group, Very Heavy on 10 July.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=62}} The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron was inactivated on 19 August.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=220}} At Roswell, the 509th became the nuclear strike and deterrence core of the Strategic Air Command, and was the only unit capable of delivery of nuclear weapons until June 1948, when [[B-50 Superfortress]]es were initially deployed.  The 509th itself converted to the B-50 in 1950, and transferred its ''Silverplate'' B-29s to the squadrons of the [[97th Bombardment Wing]] at [[Biggs Air Force Base]], Texas.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=56, 111}}

'''Andrew R. Heinze''' (born 19 January 1955) is an American playwright, non-fiction author, and scholar of [[History of the United States|American history]]. Growing up in [[New Jersey]] in a close-knit Jewish family, he left home at fourteen to attend [[Blair Academy]], graduated from [[Amherst College]] in [[Massachusetts]], and moved to [[California]]. He did his graduate work at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], training in American History, with an emphasis on the history of race, immigration and the history of [[American Jews]]. During his academic career he taught both American and Jewish history at several American universities and was a tenured professor of History at the [[University of San Francisco]], where he was director of the [[Swig Judaic Studies Program]], holding the Mae and Benjamin Swig Chair and creating several new programs including an [[Ulpan]] and a Judaic studies lecture series.

He has written extensively about the American Jewish social, intellectual and cultural experience, and is the author of  ''Adapting to Abundance'' (1990), the first full-length study of the impact of American consumer culture on an immigrant group, as well as ''Jews and the American Soul'' (2004), which hypothesizes that Jewish intellectuals provided a framework that came to shape the American psyche. He co-authored two books that deal with race and ethnicity, and he has contributed to a wide variety of [[Academic journal|scholarly journals]] as well as to popular newspapers, periodicals and online publications. His books and articles have been widely reviewed, praised in the scholarly community, and cited extensively.

In 2006, feeling creatively stifled by the confines of [[academic writing]], he left his tenured [[Professors in the United States|full professorship]] at [[University of San Francisco|USF]] and moved to [[New York City]] to begin playwriting. He has written one-act as well as full-length plays, many of them focusing on the historical and Jewish themes that had absorbed him in his former career; these include a comedy about [[Moses]] and his family, a drama about a New York Jewish family adjusting to life after [[World War II]], and a drama about an [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[Russians|Russian]] immigrant who, in desperation, has turned to prostitution. His plays have been produced [[Off-Broadway]] in New York City and around the United States; several have won awards in national playwriting competitions.

== Early life and education ==
Andrew R. Heinze was born on January 19, 1955 into a close-knit Jewish family in [[Passaic, New Jersey]].{{sfn|Merwin|23 April 2013}} His paternal grandmother (also born in Passaic) was one of eight children born to a self-made Polish Jew who had supplied coal to the city of Passaic. Heinze memorialized his grandmother in an article he wrote for ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' shortly after she died at the age of 101; he described her as a flamboyant, stylish, and impeccably dressed woman, and he recalled that after his grandfather (her husband of 60 years) had died, she "kept on going, honestly confessing her loneliness but unflaggingly maintaining her enthusiasm for life and for us." He quoted her as frequently giving him the reminder, "We are 100% Americans, dear, always remember that!"{{sfn|Heinze|31 December 2004}} Heinze has a close relationship with his parents; in his acknowledgements of his second book, he wrote, "I have been blessed with extraordinarily devoted parents who enabled me, as a child, to feel at home in the world." His mother, he said, is a woman of "gentle disposition, sensitivity to human qualities that others overlook, vivacious imagination, love of art, and whimsical sense of humor," and his father he described as a man of "great loyalty, heartfelt devotion, and frequent praise [that] helped me set my sights high and pick myself up when fallen low."{{sfn|Heinze|October 2004|page=xvi}}

At age fourteen Heinze won a scholarship to [[Blair Academy]], a private boarding school in [[Warren County, New Jersey]].  His experience at Blair was formative. It was there that he first discovered a fascination with both writing and history. In a 2005 interview, he recalled that he had relished the mental stimulation his Blair teachers had given him, that they took his intellectual growth very seriously, and that he still recalled distinct lectures from many of his classes.{{sfn|Blair Bulletin|Spring 2005|p=12}}  He honed his writing skills working for Blair's school newspaper; he started as a reporter doing local news and [[human interest story|human interest stories]] and ended up as the paper's [[editor-in-chief]].{{sfn|Blair Bulletin|Spring 2005|p=12}} Graduating from Blair in 1973, he won a Bodman Foundation scholarship which enabled him to attend [[Amherst College]], where he received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1977, graduating [[Magna Cum Laude]].{{sfn|Amherst Alumni}} After graduating from Amherst, he left the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], moved to [[California]], and attended graduate school at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where he received his [[Master of Arts|MA]] (1980) and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] (1987) in [[American History]].{{sfn|Berkeley Alumni}}

== Academic career ==
Heinze's first professorship was at [[San Jose State University]], where he taught [[United States History]] and won San Jose State University's Meritorious Performance and Professional Promise Award for 1988-1989.{{sfn|USF Official Faculty 2006/CV}} He later taught United States History at the [[University of California, Davis]] and the University of California, Berkeley{{sfn|USF Official Faculty 2006/CV}} before becoming a tenured Full Professor at the [[University of San Francisco]], where he taught  American History from 1994 to 2006. He won the University of San Francisco's [[Ignatius of Loyola|Ignatian]] Faculty Service Award in 2003.{{sfn|Emeriti and Retired Faculty 2014–2015}}{{sfn|USF Official Faculty 2006/CV}}

Heinze specialized in the history of race and immigration in the United States, the evolution of American consumer culture, and the interaction between psychology and religion in American history. He researched and taught extensively on both African-Americans and Jews in the United States, and he maintained strong interests in relations between [[Christianity and Judaism]], [[religion and homosexuality]], racism and [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

In 1997 Heinze, who was faculty adviser to USF's [[Jewish Student Union]], was appointed to be the Mae and Benjamin Swig Chair in the [[Swig Judaic Studies Program]] and to direct the program.{{sfn|Weinstein|7 November 1997}} The Swig program was established in 1977 and is believed to have been the first such program established in a Catholic university.){{sfn|Program History}} Heinze's first act as director was to invite [[Jan Karski]], a man he had long admired, to speak at the program's upcoming 20th anniversary dinner. Karski, renowned for his active role in the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II]], delivered the keynote address before an audience that included former Secretary of State, [[George Shultz]].{{sfn|USF News|15 October 1997|p=1}}

To solidify the Swig Program's academic standing, Heinze created a Jewish Studies Certificate program and expanded the curriculum beyond the theology department by introducing courses in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], Jewish history, [[The Holocaust]], Jewish American literature, and Yiddish culture.{{sfn|Weinstein|7 November 1997}} Free public lectures and programs were made available to the general public,{{sfn|Weinstein|7 November 1997}} and in 1998 he created [[Ulpan San Francisco]], an intense Israeli-style Hebrew immersion program that was scheduled during the summer and served anyone living in the San Francisco Bay area; it was the first such program to be offered there{{sfn|Katz|24 July 1998}} and is still a part of that community.{{sfn|Summer Ulpan|2014}}

In 1998 Heinze inaugurated The Swig Annual Lecture Series (1998-2005) which brought distinguished scholars to the university; the lectures were presented free to the general public and were published and distributed to universities, public libraries, and individual scholars in the United States and abroad. Heinze hand-picked the topics as well as the participating lecturers, bringing public attention to a range of often controversial subjects that were of special interest to him.{{sfn|Prothero|22 September 2005}} Two of the lectures garnered particularly strong public interest: one dealt with [[relations between Catholicism and Judaism]] (the speakers were [[Cardinal Edward Cassidy]], president of the [[Pontifical Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews]], and renowned British rabbi, [[Norman Solomon (rabbi)|Rabbi Norman Solomon]]).{{sfn|Lattin|16 April 2000}} The other lecture focused on homosexuality. Heinze had wanted to discover if there was a way "gay and lesbian Jews and Christians [might] find a more comfortable place within their faith-communities." (He had wanted to include Muslim speakers but was unable to find anyone.){{sfn|Heinze|8 April 2002}} The lecture was presented in the form of a symposium and was entitled "New Jewish and Christian Approaches to Homosexuality." Even in the liberal community of San Francisco, it sparked heated debate because established religion did not normally deal explicitly with the issue.&lt;ref&gt;See:

=== Scholarly writings ===
[[File:Mulberry Street NYC c1900 LOC 3g04637u edit.jpg|thumb|280px|Downtown shopping in New York City, c1900]]

Heinze's first book, ''Adapting to Abundance: Jewish Immigrants, Mass Consumption, and the Search for American Identity'', was published in 1990.{{sfn| Heinze|October 1992}} It was the first full-length study of the impact of American consumer culture on an immigrant group. [[Hasia Diner]], Professor of History at [[New York University]], said about Heinze: “Historians of immigration and Jewish history will be indebted to him for opening up whole areas of behavior which they previously shrugged off as irrelevant.”{{sfn|Diner|Fall 1992|pp=117–118}} The Journal of Consumer Affairs remarked upon the variety of topics that the book explored: the rise of ad campaigns for major American products in the foreign-language press; the rise of the summer vacation among working people; installment-buying as a way for working families to obtain expensive furnishings such as pianos; the role of Jewish women as agents of assimilation through their control over family purchases; and the way that American abundance altered religious rituals, especially holidays such as Chanukah and Passover.{{sfn|Silber|Summer 1991|pages=185-188}} ''Adapting to Abundance'' established Heinze's reputation as part of a scholarly vanguard that produced the first histories of mass consumption in Europe and America. It is widely referenced in books, articles and syllabi around the world.{{sfn|"Adapting to Abundance" Heinze: search results}}{{sfn|Lambert|16 July 2010}}

In 2004 Heinze published ''Jews and the American Soul: Human Nature in the Twentieth Century''.{{sfn|Publishers Weekly|23 August 2004}}{{sfn|Breiger|4 November 2004}} [[David Hollinger]], Professor of History at the University of California, Berkeley said, "''Jews and the American Soul'' is the most forthright, probing, nuanced, and carefully documented book yet addressed to the ways in which modern American culture has been influenced by Jews. A truly distinctive work of American history."{{sfn|Princeton University Press}} [[Jon Butler]], Professor of American Studies, History, and Religious Studies at [[Yale University]], said about the book, "Heinze explains how Jewish intellectuals uncovered and explicated the marrow of American identity even as, or precisely because, they sought to secure their place in an America that did not always want them. Heinze uplifts an unexpected, enlightening story with insight, grace, and not infrequent irony--a simply fascinating read."{{sfn|Princeton University Press}} It was named one of the "Best Books of 2004" by [[Publishers Weekly]],{{sfn|Publishers Weekly|6 December 2004}} was runner up in the 2005 [[National Jewish Book Award]] in the American Jewish History category, and was a [[Jewish Book Council]] Finalist for the 2004 Weinberg Judaic Studies Institute Book Award, [[University of Scranton]].{{sfn|University of Scranton}}{{sfn|Weinberg Judaic Studies Institute|2005}}

Heinze was one of nine authors who contributed to ''The Columbia Documentary History of Race and Ethnicity in America'' ([[Columbia University Press]]), and to the abridged ''Race and Ethnicity in America: A Concise History.''{{sfn|Bayor|October 2003}} The ''Columbia Documentary History'' was praised as a "massive collection of primary-source documents dealing with 'the other' in America... [including]... an extensive introductory essay by a leading historian in the field."{{sfn|Bayor|July 2004}}

His scholarly articles have appeared in a wide variety of journals including, [[Journal of American History]], [[Judaism]]. [[American Quarterly]], [[Religion and American Culture]], [[American Jewish History]], [[Journal of the West]], [[American Jewish Archives]], and [[Reviews in American History]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

=== Opinion pieces and essays ===

Heinze's [[essay]]s and [[opinion piece]]s have been widely published in newspapers, journals, periodicals and online publications. His opinion pieces are occasionally political, sometimes historical, but most focus on timely issues involving race, immigration or religion. His essays, in contrast, are often cultural critiques of popular books, television shows or movies. Sometimes his essays explore his own family or his personal life; sometimes they are serious, but often they are light-hearted or comic.&lt;ref&gt;See:

* {{harv|Sailer|May 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opinion pieces====
Heinze's opinion pieces rarely focus on politics, but in 2002 on the [[History News Network]], he faulted [[George W. Bush]] for giving "a businessman's response" to questions about corporate greed. He suggested that [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (one of his favorite historical figures) would have spoken differently. "Theodore Roosevelt," Heinze said, "never thought or spoke like a businessman. On the contrary," he pointed out, "he placed military men, statesmen and even scholars &amp;ndash; but not businessmen &amp;ndash; at the top of his hierarchy of values... Selfishness, especially materialistic selfishness, offended him as a profound moral dereliction."{{sfn|Heinze |29 July 2002}}

Heinze has often written about antisemitism, but his concerns have usually focused on countries other than the United States. "One of the reasons Jews have traditionally viewed America as a promised land is the comparative absence of violence against them," he said. In 1999, however, [[Buford Furrow]] and the [[Los Angeles Jewish Community Center shooting]] got his attention, and he wrote an opinion piece about it for the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''. "Standing at the end of the decade, the century and the millennium," he wrote,  "I think we must agree with Buford Furrow about one thing. The attack on a Jewish day care center in Los Angeles is a wake-up call."{{sfn|Heinze|13 August 1999}}

[[File:Karski Heinze San Francisco.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Heinze with [[Jan Karski]], Opera Plaza in San Francisco, 1997]]
Heinze has written a number of opinion pieces that have focused on the relations between Catholics and Jews. It was logical that he would be interested in the subject because he was a Jew who worked in a Catholic university, he was faculty advisor for the school's Jewish Student Union, and he was director of the school's Jewish Studies program. There was another, more personal, reason for his interest, however; in 1997 he had met [[Jan Karski]], the courageous Polish Catholic who was recognized in 1982 as [[Righteous Among the Nations]] for his efforts to help the Jews in World War II. (Karski had said in 1981, "just as my wife’s entire family was wiped out in the ghettos of Poland, in its concentration camps and crematoria — so have all the Jews who were slaughtered become my family. But I am a Christian Jew... I am a practicing Catholic... My faith tells me the second original sin has been committed by humanity. This sin will haunt humanity to the end of time. And I want it to be so.”){{sfn|Yad Vashem}} After Karski delivered the keynote address at the first Swig function Heinze had presided over, he had spent some personal time with Heinze and his family; Heinze never forgot Karski's gentle warmth, his integrity and his courage.{{sfn|USF News|15 October 1997|p=1}}

In 1998 Heinze wrote an opinion piece for the ''Examiner'', "The Vatican Repents Catholic Anti-Semitism;" it focused on the long-awaited and newly released document, ''[[We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah]]'', published by [[Edward Cassidy|Cardinal Edward Cassidy]], President of the [[Pontifical Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews]]. The document had caused heated controversy; many critics argued that it didn't go far enough in taking responsibility for the past. Heinze's ''Examiner'' article opened with the story of [[Bernard Lichtenberg]], a Catholic priest who was arrested in 1941 by the [[Berlin]] [[Gestapo]] because he had publicly prayed for the Jews; after his arrest, Lichtenberg asked to be sent away with the Jews so that he could pray for their welfare. He spent the next two years in a [[Nazi]] prison camp and died on his way to [[Dachau]]. After telling the story of Father Lichtenberg, Heinze gave his opinion of the ''We Remember'' document. He agreed with the critics that "The Catholic Church must reckon with historical fact, proving its awareness of sin in high places." "But," he added, "the rest of us must encourage the message of repentance and renewal the church is preaching to its followers because, in the end, that is what produces people such as Bernard Lichtenberg." It was an opinion piece that encouraged reconciliation, not anger.{{sfn|Heinze|6 April 1998}} Two years later Heinze invited Cardinal Cassidy to San Francisco to participate in a Swig  lecture on interfaith understanding. Cardinal Cassidy accepted the invitation.{{sfn|Lattin|16 April 2000}}

====Essays====
In his [[The Jewish Daily Forward|Jewish Daily Forward]] essay, "Breaking the Mold of the Sitcom," Heinze analyzes his favorite TV comedy, ''[[Seinfeld]]'', casting an affectionate eye on the show's creators, [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Larry David]], and marveling at their success in probing "the many gestures, innuendoes and gaps in the messages we send each other every day in every type of situation. Those, they know, contain the real meanings that pass back and forth beneath the surface of our conventions. Those are the explosives littering the minefield that is life in society." Heinze is stunned that the show is able to pack so much original comedy into twenty-two minutes of airtime, and he has little sympathy for people who dismiss the show as being shallow or neurotically self-focused: "People with little sense of humor have failed, time and again, to understand that the notorious self-centeredness of the show’s characters enables us to laugh at the selfish, neurotic traits we all share but prefer to disguise."{{sfn|Heinze|24 December 2004}} 
[[File:Ali g.JPG|thumb|180px|Ali g in his full "wannabe-gangsta" rap regalia]]

In another Jewish Daily Forward essay, "Life Among the Goyim," Heinze looks at the British comedian, [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], and his TV comedy, [[Da Ali G Show]], whose title character is a parody of a "white wannabe-gangsta rapper who not only adopts all the appropriate clothes, gestures and locutions but also convinces himself that he is black." In his essay, Heinze points out that Baron Cohen is a Jew who speaks Hebrew and keeps [[Kosher foods|kosher]]; and his undergraduate history thesis at [[Cambridge University]] was on black-Jewish relations. Yet, Heinze wonders, is there anything about his comedy that is specifically Jewish? For Heinze, the answer is yes, and he arrives at the "yes" in the following whimsical way: "If we take 'goyim' loosely to mean people who are strange, often affable, and potentially dangerous, then, yes, 'Da Ali G Show' is Jewish comedy and we, in our digital phantasmagoria of a world, are all goyim, all on camera, all the time."{{sfn|Heinze|3 March 2006}}

"A Lost Chapter From the Life of Oz" (also in ''The Jewish Daily Forward'') explores [[Amos Oz|Amos Oz's]] 2005 memoir, ''[[A Tale of Love and Darkness]]''. Heinze (who speaks Hebrew) noticed that the English translation was missing a chapter (chapter five). His essay is built on that discovery, and it seems the missing chapter was extracted (presumably by the editors) because it was a rant against "bad readers." It was thought, apparently, that chapter five would interrupt the flow of the book, or otherwise "put-off" the English-speaking audience. As to the actual information in chapter five: Oz believes that "bad readers" are intrusive; they are inquisitive about the author's life; they ask very personal questions; they pry; they make his life hell; they behave like the people on TMZ. Oz equates "the bad reader" with “a psychopathic lover.” Heinze was fascinated by the missing chapter and by Oz's assessment of things, and he approached the memoir (and its missing chapter) from an interesting slant, comparing it to the memoir ''Hunger of Memory'' by [[Richard Rodriguez]], whose editors also tried (unsuccessfully) to get him to take out certain controversial passages from his book.{{sfn|Heinze|29 October 2014}}

== Theatrical career ==

In a 2005 interview, Heinze spoke of the creative frustration that led him to leave academia. "Even though I was doing a lot of academic writing," he said, "I had this ceaseless, nagging feeling that I wasn't fulfilling myself creatively... I finally took the plunge into a real fiction project... [and] it became clear to me that creative rather than scholarly writing was my real métier."{{sfn|Blair Bulletin|Spring 2005|p=12}} He chose playwriting, in particular, because of [[Joe Orton]]; the intensity, intelligence and dark humor of Orton's plays had fascinated him.{{sfn|Samuel French Festival|23 September 2012}} In 2006 he left his tenured Full Professorship at USF, moved to New York City, and embarked on a career in playwriting.{{sfn|Weingarden|March 2007|p=1}} 
[[File:The Invention of the Living Room.JPG|thumb|left|260px|The set of ''The Invention of the Living Room'', HB Studio, New York City (2009)]]

His first full-length play, ''Turtles All the Way Down,'' although unproduced, was praised by the [[Soho Theatre]] in London as "an accomplished first effort...sharp and highly enjoyable... very theatrical: fast moving with lots of humour."{{sfn|Gromelski}} His next play, ''The Invention of the Living Room'', started as a one-act play; it was produced in 2009 by [[HB Studio]] in [[Manhattan|Manhattan's]] [[West Village]], and it had a second production at the [[Metropolitan Playhouse]] in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].{{sfn|Merwin|23 April 2013}} 
The play focused on a [[Lower East Side]] Jewish family, struggling in the aftermath of World War II. Heinze expanded it into a full-length version that won a place in the Harriet Lake Festival of New Plays at the [[Orlando Shakespeare Theater]] in 2011.{{sfn|Orlando Shakespeare Theater|2011}} In 2012 it was a Finalist for the Blue Ink Playwriting Award given by the [[American Blues Theater]] in Chicago,{{sfn|Samuel French Festival|23 September 2012}} and in 2014 it won the Texas NonProfit Theatres' New Play Project, with a World Premiere at the Tyler Civic Theatre.{{sfn|Texas Nonprofit Theatres}}

He wrote ''Hamilton'', a tragedy about [[Alexander Hamilton]], in 2012; it was a semi-finalist for the 2012 National Playwrights Conference at the [[Eugene O'Neill Theatre]] and a Finalist for the [[T. Schreiber Studio]]’s 2012 New Works Festival.{{sfn|Samuel French Festival|23 September 2012}} His dark comedy ''Please Lock Me Away'' was a Finalist at the Kitchen Dog Theater (Dallas) 2014 New Play competition.{{sfn|Broadway World|26 July 2014}} ''Moses, The Author'', a comedy about the biblical Moses, "shows the 120-year-old lawgiver on his last day on earth as he races to finish the Torah"{{sfn|Merwin|16 September 2014}} Heinze said the play "is a 'midrash' that imagines how Moses might have dealt with the series of crushing setbacks that faced him, from having a speech defect to being told that could not enter the Promised Land."{{sfn|Merwin|16 September 2014}}  ''Moses, The Author'' had a World Premiere at the [[New York International Fringe Festival]] in 2014,{{sfn|Rinn|15 August 2014}}{{sfn|Roberts|August 2014}} won a place in the Harriet Lake Festival of New Plays at the Orlando Shakespeare Theater (2014),{{sfn|Orlando Shakespeare Theater|2014}} and had an extended run at the [[SoHo]] Playhouse in Manhattan.{{sfn|Merwin|16 September 2014}}

Heinze has written a number of [[one-act play]]s and believes the short-play format can teach a writer "the basics of dramatic structure."{{sfn|Gromelski}} His short plays have been produced across the United States and have won numerous awards. In 2010 his one-act comedy, ''The FQ'', won "Audience Favorite" at the New York City Fifteen-Minute Play Festival, and at the same festival, the following year, his short comedy, ''The Bar Mitzvah of Jesus Goldfarb,'' won "Judges' Choice" and "Audience Choice for Best Play."{{sfn|Broadway World|26 July 2014}} ''The FQ'' was published in ''The Best Ten-Minute Plays 2011'', by Smith &amp; Kraus.{{sfn|The Best Ten-Minute Plays 2011|1 June 2012}} His one-act drama ''Masha: Conditions in the Holy Land'' won the Jury Prize for Best Script at the Fusion Theatre Company's 2012 Short Play Festival ([[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]),{{sfn|Chisholm| 13 July 2012}} and in 2013 it was produced for the 38th Annual [[Samuel French]] [[Off-Off-Broadway]] Short Play Festival in New York City.{{sfn|Samuel French Festival|23 September 2012}}

Asked by Samuel French, Inc. if he could name the playwright who had most influenced him, Heinze said, "If I were darker, it would be [[Joe Orton|Orton]]. If I were more laconic, it would be [[Harold Pinter|Pinter]]. If I were more lyrically erudite, it would be [[Tom Stoppard|Stoppard]]. If I had ten additional brains, it would be [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. Hm. Everyone seems to be English.  If I were more Irish, it would be [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]. (And if I had more ''savoir faire'', it would be [[Molière]].)" He added, "I think all my sources of inspiration are unconventional. It's the feeling of something unconventional that makes me want to write the play. At least for a full-length play that’s true. I think I wouldn't want to invest the time if I didn’t have that feeling."{{sfn|Samuel French Festival|23 September 2012}}

The '''Association of Moving Image Archivists''' ('''AMIA''') is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[Nonprofit#USA|not-for-profit]] organization established to advance the field of [[Film preservation|moving image archiving]] by fostering cooperation among individuals and organizations concerned with the acquisition, description, preservation, exhibition and use of moving image materials.

==History==
[[File:AMPAS PickfordCenter.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]'s [[Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study]], 1313 N. [[Vine Street|Vine St.]], [[Hollywood]] - Home to the AMIA Office]]

Since the late 1960s, representatives from moving image archives have recognized the value of regular meetings to exchange practical information and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;For further information on the emergence of formal representation for the audiovisual preservation sector in the United States, see Anthony Slide, ''Nitrate Won't Wait: A History of Film Preservation in the United States'', Jefferson, NC, McFarland (1992), pp. 81-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, this group of archivists originally known as the Film and Television Archives Advisory Committee (F/TAAC) expanded from a handful of participants to several hundred archivists from over 100 national, regional and local institutions. In 1990, the name of the group was changed to the Association of Moving Image Archivists. In 1991, AMIA voted to formalize as an individual-based member-based [[professional association]], the only one of its kind in the moving image archival field. Although AMIA's office is based in the US, its membership is now drawn from across the world.  Further information on the origins and history of AMIA can be found [http://www.amianet.org/about/mission here].&lt;ref&gt;See also Tom McGreevey and Joanne L. Yeck, ''Our Movie Heritage'', New Brunswick, NJ, Rutgers University Press (1997), pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Membership is open to anyone who has an interest in the [[film preservation|preservation of moving images]] and associated sound recordings: in practice, most of the membership are professional [[archivist]]s (both [[public sector]] and [[Business|commercial]]) and people working in associated professions, e.g. [[librarian]]ship, the [[Film industry|film]] and [[television]] industry or [[Academia|academics]] in related fields.  AMIA offers both individual and institutional membership.

==Governing structure==
AMIA is governed by a [[Board of Directors]], which is elected by the membership on a two-year cycle, and chaired by a [[President#Non-governmental presidents|president]].  The Board oversees and ratifies the work of the sub-groups through which the work of the organization is undertaken.  The last significant changes to the governing structure were undertaken in 2009, when the present structure of committees and task forces was introduced.

===Committees and Task Forces===

AMIA is a volunteer based organization and projects rely on work done by its members in Committees and Task Forces.  More information about AMIA's Committees [http://www.amianet.org/community/committees can be found here].

* '''[[Committee]]s of the Board''' carry out the core management and policymaking functions of AMIA, e.g. running elections and organizing the conference.  Chairs are appointed directly by the Board of Directors, and although their members are volunteers drawn from within the wider AMIA membership, the rosters of Committees of the Board have to be approved by the Board.
* '''Committees of the Membership''' are the bodies through which AMIA's professional presence in the field exists.  They develop expertise, advocacy and education in the different topics and activities related to moving image archiving, e.g. preservation, copyright and cataloguing.  Their rosters are volunteers from within the AMIA membership, and they elect their chairs directly.
* '''[[task force|Task Forces]]''' are created by the Board of Directors to carry out a specific projects which does not fall squarely within the remit of an existing committee, and are dissolved on completion of that task.

The AMIA [[Newsletter]] is published electronically four times per year. It provides up-to-date information about the association and its activities, as well as regular columns and features and resources of interest to moving image archivists.

''The Moving Image'' is a peer-reviewed [[academic journal]]  that explores topics relevant to both the media archivist and the media scholar. The Moving Image deals with crucial issues surrounding the preservation, archiving, and restoration of film, video, and digital moving images.  It is edited by Susan Ohmer and Don Crafton and published by [[University of Minnesota Press]].

''The AMIA Global Supplier Directory'',  is published electronically four times per year and available on the AMIA website.  The Supplier Directory is intended as an international resource guide for anyone working with audiovisual media.

===Scholarship and Internship Programs===
The training of moving image archivists is central to AMIA's role as a professional organization and essential to the long-term survival of our moving image heritage.  To this end, in addition to workshops and symposia, AMIA offers annual scholarships for students in education and training programs geared to the profession.  In addition, AMIA offers the [[Image Permanence Institute]] Internship in Preservation Research, offering a student of merit who is committed to the preservation of moving images the opportunity to acquire practical experience in preservation research.

===Professional Programs===
AMIA supports a number of public and professional programs to promote education and foster cooperation and communication among the individuals and organizations concerned with the acquisition, preservation, description, exhibition, and use of moving image materials.

As an international organization, AMIA offers two programs to encourage professional exchange and enhance professional development to professional archivists from the [[Developing country|developing world]].  More information can be found here:  http://www.amianet.org/programs-and-initiatives/list-of-programs

The Your Archive Deserves Advocacy! initiative offers three annual awards in an effort focused on promoting the people and stories behind archives as well as providing resources that support advocacy.

Community Travel Grants were established to pay tribute to the work of AMIA members, and offer colleagues, friends and families a way to honor contributions to the moving image field. The Fund provides travel funding for the AMIA Annual Conference.

AMIA provides [[workshop]]s covering a range of archival activities.  Workshops are offered primarily in conjunction with the annual conference, but AMIA also offers regional hands-on workshops when possible.  Recent workshops have covered:  digital programming basics; [[library catalog|cataloging]] &amp; [[metadata]]; safeguarding audio visual assets; archival film presentation for [[projectionist]]s, a writers workshop, access copy production for archivists, copyright, and an annual Hackday! and Community Archiving Workshop.

===Screenings and Events===
In addition to the three key events listed, AMIA organizes a number of special screenings and workshops that celebrate the preservation and restoration work done by archivists worldwide.

==Outreach==
As an NGO ([[non-governmental organization]]) AMIA has consultative status with [[UNESCO]] and has coordinated on international events and presented at UNESCO events - most recently at the [[Memory of the World Programme]] Conference in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Caroline Frick presentation at 2012 Memory of the World Conference"&gt;{{cite web|last=Frick|first=Caroline|title=AMIA Presentation at 2012 Memory of the World Conference|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/mow/VC_Frick_28_B_1050.pdf|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, AMIA is affiliated with, and undertakes joint activities with, a number of organizations and projects worldwide.  As the current chair of the [[Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Association]], AMIA works with other international audiovisual archives associations to promote the work done by archivists and to influence the development of public policy on issues of importance to the preservation of our audiovisual heritage.

On October 27 each year AMIA members participate in and promote the [[World Day for Audiovisual Heritage]].  In 2006 at its 33rd session the General Conference of UNESCO declared 27 October as World Day for Audiovisual Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO's World Day for Audiovisual Heritage|url=https://www.un.org/en/events/audiovisualday/background.shtml|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is a unique occasion to raise awareness of the importance of sounds and images as a source of history of the last 150 years and of the importance of preserving them and making them accessible to whoever is interested in their content.

AMIA participation also includes the following: a founding member of NAANICA (North American Archival Network), a branch of [[International Council on Archives|ICA]]; a founding member of the United States Committee of the Blue Shield, a branch of [[International Committee of the Blue Shield]]; representation on the [[National Film Preservation Board]]; a member of the [[Digital Promise]] coalition; and maintains relationships with more than a dozen organizations with similar missions.

{{Marxism|Variants}}
'''Autonomism''' (also '''authonomous Marxism''' or '''autonomist Marxism''') is a set of [[anti-authoritarian]] [[left-wing]] political and social movements and theories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1342334/AUTONOMISM_AS_A_GLOBAL_SOCIAL_MOVEMENT "Autonomism as a global social movement" by Patrick Cuninghame]. ''WorkingUSA: The Journal of Labor and Society''. Volume 13 (December 2010): 451–464. {{ISSN|1089-7011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eroseffect.com/books/subversion_download.htm Georgy Katsiaficas.

Sylvere Lotringer &amp; Christian Marazzi. New York: Semiotext(e), 1980, 2007. {{ISBN|1-58435-053-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58435-053-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a theoretical system, it first emerged in [[History of the Italian Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Later, [[Post-Marxism|post-Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian [[far-left]] movements in the 1970s, and the emergence of a number of important theorists including [[Antonio Negri]], who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'', as well as [[Mario Tronti]], [[Paolo Virno]] and [[Franco Berardi|Franco "Bifo" Berardi]].

Georgy Katsiaficas summarizes the forms of autonomous movements saying that "In contrast to the centralized decisions and [[hierarchical]] [[Anti-authoritarianism|authority]] structures of modern institutions, autonomous social movements involve people directly in decisions affecting their everyday lives. They seek to expand democracy and to help individuals break free of political structures and behavior patterns imposed from the outside."&lt;ref&gt;Georgy Katsiaficas. ''The Subversion of Politics: European Autonomous Social Movements and the Decolonization of Everyday Life''. AK Press. 2006. pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt; As such this has involved a call for the independence of social movements from political parties&lt;ref&gt;Georgy Katsiaficas. ''The Subversion of Politics: European Autonomous Social Movements and the Decolonization of Everyday Life''. AK Press. 2006. pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt; in a revolutionary perspective which seeks to create a practical political alternative to both [[State socialism|authoritarian socialism]] and contemporary [[representative democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Georgy Katsiaficas. ''The Subversion of Politics: European Autonomous Social Movements and the Decolonization of Everyday Life''. AK Press. 2006. pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Autonomism influenced the German and Dutch ''Autonomen'', the worldwide [[social centre movement]], and today is influential in Italy, France, and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[anarchists]].

==Etymology==
The term ''autonomia''/''Autonome'' is composed out of two Greek words: αὐτο- ''auto-'' "self" and νόμος ''nomos'', "law", hence when combined understood to mean "one who gives oneself one's own [[law]]". [[Wiktionary:autonomy|Autonomy]], in this sense, is not [[independence]]. While independence refers to an [[autarky|autarchic]] kind of life, separated from the [[community]], autonomy refers to life in society but by one's own rule. Though the notion of ''autonomism'' was alien to the ancient Greeks, the concept is indirectly endorsed by [[Aristotle]], who stated that only beasts or gods could be independent and live apart from the ''[[polis]]'' ("community"), while [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] defined the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] by autonomy of thought and the famous ''"[[Sapere aude]]"'' ("dare to know").

==The Marxist Autonomist theory==
{{Left communism sidebar|Related}}
Unlike other forms of [[Marxism]], autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the [[working class]] to force changes to the organization of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system independent of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[trade unions]] or [[political parties]]. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than are other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a "bottom-up" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working-class resistance to capitalism, such as [[absenteeism]], slow working, socialization in the workplace, [[sabotage]], and other subversive activities.

Like other Marxists, autonomists see [[class struggle]] as being of central importance. However, autonomists have a broader definition of the working class than do other Marxists: as well as wage-earning workers (both [[White-collar worker|white collar]] and [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]]), autonomists also include in this category the unwaged (students, the unemployed, homemakers, etc.), who are traditionally deprived of any form of union representation.

Early theorists (such as [[Mario Tronti]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Sergio Bologna]], and [[Paolo Virno]]) developed notions of "immaterial" and "social labour" that extended the Marxist concept of labour to all society. They suggested that modern society's wealth was produced by unaccountable [[collective]] work, and that only a little of this was redistributed to the workers in the form of wages. Other Italian autonomists—particularly feminists, such as [[Mariarosa Dalla Costa]] and [[Silvia Federici]]—emphasised the importance of [[feminism]] and the value of unpaid female labour to capitalist society.

A scholar of the movement, Michael Ryan, writes that {{quote|Autonomy, as a movement and as a theory, opposes the notion that capitalism is an irrational system which can be made rational through planning. Instead, it assumes the workers' viewpoint, privileging their activity as the lever of revolutionary passage as that which alone can construct a communist society. Economics is seen as being entirely political; economic relations are direct political relations of force between class subjects. And it is in the economic category of the social worker, not in an alienated political form like the party, that the initiative for political change resides.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ryan, "Translators' Introductions Part II," Antonio Negri, Marx beyond Marx: Lessons on the Grundrisse, New York: Autonomedia, 1991, p. xxx.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Italian autonomism==
[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|left|[[Antonio Negri]], a leading theorist of Italian autonomism]]
Autonomist Marxism—referred to in Italy as ''[[operaismo]]'', which translates literally as "workerism"—first appeared in Italy in the early 1960s. Arguably, the emergence of early autonomism can be traced to the dissatisfaction of automotive workers in [[Turin]] with their union, which reached an agreement with [[FIAT]]. The disillusionment of these workers with their organised representation, along with the resultant riots (in particular the 1962 riots by FIAT workers in Turin, "fatti di Piazza Statuto"), were critical factors in the development of a theory of self-organised labour representation outside the scope of traditional representatives such as [[trade union]]s.

In 1969, the ''[[operaismo]]'' approach was active mainly in two different groups: ''[[Lotta Continua]]'', led by [[Adriano Sofri]] (which had a very significant [[Roman Catholic]] cultural matrix), and ''[[Potere Operaio]]'', led by [[Antonio Negri]], [[Franco Piperno]], [[Oreste Scalzone]], and [[Valerio Morucci]]. [[Mario Capanna]] was the charismatic leader of the Milan student movement, which had a more classical [[Marxist-Leninist]] approach.

===Influences===
Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson–Forest Tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]. The Johnson-Forest Tendency had studied working-class life and struggles within the US auto industry, publishing pamphlets such as "The American Worker" (1947), "Punching Out" (1952), and "Union Committeemen and Wildcat Strikes" (1955). That work was translated into French by Socialisme ou Barbarie and published, serially, in their journal. They too began investigating and writing about what was going on inside workplaces, in their case inside both auto factories and insurance offices.

The journal ''Quaderni Rossi'' ("Red Notebooks"), produced between 1961 and 1965, and its successor ''Classe Operaia'' ("Working Class"), produced between 1963 and 1966, were also influential in the development of early autonomism. [[Raniero Panzieri]], [[Mario Tronti]], and [[Toni Negri]] were some primary collaborators.

[[Pirate radio]] stations also were a factor in spreading autonomist ideas. [[Bologna]]'s [[Radio Alice]] was an example of such a station.

===Direct action===
{{further|Years of Lead (Italy)}}

[[File:Askatasuna torino.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Askatasuna'' "autonomist" social center in [[Turin]] (2016)]]

The Italian [[student movement]], including the [[Indiani Metropolitani]] (Metropolitan Indians), starting from 1966 with the murder of student Paolo Rossi by [[neo-fascists]] at [[Sapienza University of Rome|Rome University]], engaged in various [[direct action]] operations, including riots and occupations, along with more peaceful activities such as self-reduction, in which individuals refused to pay for such services and goods as public transport, electricity, gas, rent, and food. Several clashes occurred between students and the police during the occupations of universities in the winter of 1967–68, during the [[Fiat]] occupations, and in March 1968 in Rome during the [[Battle of Valle Giulia]].

Indiani Metropolitani were a small faction active in the Italian far-left protest movement during 1976 and 1977, in the so-called "[[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]]". The Indiani Metropolitani were the so-called 'creative' wing of the movement. Its adherents wore face-paint like the war-paint of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and dressed like [[hippies]]. The emphasis was on "stare insieme" (being together), spontaneity and the arts, especially music. The group was active in Rome, during the occupation of the university La Sapienza in 1977.

On 11 March 1977, riots took place in Bologna following the killing of student Francesco Lorusso by police.

Beginning in 1979, the state effectively prosecuted the autonomist movement, accusing it of protecting the [[Red Brigades]], which had kidnapped and assassinated [[Aldo Moro]]. 12,000 far-left activists were detained; 600 fled the country, including 300 to France and 200 to South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}[http://sebastien.schifres.free.fr/italie.htm On the Autonomist movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:tute bianche.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Members of the Italian militant social movement [[Tute Bianche]]]]

[[Tute Bianche]] was a militant Italian social movement, active from 1994 to 2001. Activists covered their bodies with padding so as to resist the blows of police, to push through police lines, and to march together in large blocks for mutual protection during [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]]. The tute bianche movement reached its apex during the [[27th G8 summit|anti-G8 protests in Genoa]], in July 2001, with a turn-out of an estimated 10,000 protesters in a single "padded block", ironically after a collective decision to go without the white overalls. Shortly after Genoa the Ya Basta Association disbanded, with certain segments reforming into the "Disobbedienti" which literally means "Disobedients". This philosophy includes the occupation and creation of [[Squatting|squat]]ted self-managed social centers, anti-sexist [[activism]], support for immigrant's rights and refugees seeking political asylum, as well as the process of walking together in large formations during demonstrations held in the streets, by force if necessary in case of clashes with police.

Central to the tute bianche movement was the Italian [[Ya Basta Association]], a network of groups throughout Italy that was inspired by the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] uprising in Chiapas in 1994. Ya Basta primarily originated in the "autonomist" [[social centers]] of Milan, particularly [[CS Leoncavallo|Centro Sociale Leoncavallo]]. These social centers grew out of the Italian Autonomia movement of the 1970 and 80s. The tute bianches have had international variations of one sort or another. For instance, in Britain a group calling itself [[WOMBLES]] adopted the tactics, even though the political orientation of WOMBLES differed from the Italian movement. In Spain, "Mono Blanco" was the preferred identifier. The first North American variant of the tute bianche, the [[NYC Ya Basta Collective]] (based in NYC) wore yellow overalls, rather than white.

==The French ''autonome'' movement&lt;!--linked from 'Cornelius Castoriadis'--&gt;==
{{Libertarian socialism|Philosophies}}

In France, the Marxist group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]], led by philosopher [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], could be said to be one of the first autonomist groups. Socialisme ou Barbarie drew upon the activist research of the American Johnson-Forest Tendency inside US auto plants and carried out their own investigations into rank-and-file workers struggles, struggles that were autonomous of union or party leadership.

Also parallel to the work of the Johnson-Forest Tendency, Socialisme ou Barbarie harshly criticised the [[Communist]] regime in the [[USSR]], which it considered a form of "[[bureaucratic collectivism|bureaucratic capitalism]]" and not at all the [[state socialism|socialism]] it claimed to be. Philosopher [[Jean-François Lyotard]] was also part of this movement.

However, the Italian influence of the ''operaismo'' movement was more directly felt in the creation of the review ''Matériaux pour l'intervention'' (1972–73) by Yann Moulier-Boutang, a French economist close to Toni Negri. This led in turn to the creation of the Camarades group (1974–78). Along with others, Moulier-Boutang joined the Centre International pour des Nouveaux Espaces de Liberté (CINEL), founded three years earlier by [[Félix Guattari]], and assisted Italian activists accused of terrorism, of whom at least 300 fled to France.

The French autonome mouvement organised itself in the AGPA (Assemblée Parisienne des Groupes Autonomes, "Parisian Assembly of Autonome Groups"; 1977–78). Many tendencies were present in it, including the Camarades group led by Moulier-Boutang, members of the Organisation communiste libertaire, some people referring themselves to the "Desiring Autonomy" of Bob Nadoulek, but also squatters and street-wise people (including the groupe Marge). French autonomes supported captured [[Red Army Faction]] former members. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] also intervened on the conditions for the detention of RAF detainees.

The militant group [[Action directe (armed group)|Action directe]] appeared in 1979 and carried out several violent direct actions. Action Directe claimed responsibility for the murders of [[Renault]]'s CEO [[Georges Besse]] and General Audran. George Besse had been CEO of nuclear company [[Eurodif]]. Action Directe was dissolved in 1987.

In the 1980s, the autonomist movement underwent a deep crisis in Italy because of effective prosecution by the State, and was stronger in Germany than in France. It remained present in Parisian squats and in some riots (for example in 1980 near the [[Jussieu Campus]] in Paris, or in 1982 in the [[Ardennes (département)|Ardennes department]] during [[anti-nuclear]] demonstrations). From 1986 to 1994 the French group [[:fr:Comité des mal logés|"Comité des mal logés"]] occupied several buildings of the French national social housing authority to denounce the cruel lack of lodging for workers, they were several hundred and took their decisions in democratic assembly, with support from all autonomous groups of Paris, many of them were worked on the anti prison . In the 1980s, the French autonomists published the periodicals ''CAT Pages'' (1981–82), ''Rebelles'' (1981–93), ''Tout !'' (1982–85), ''Molotov et Confetti'' (1984), ''Les Fossoyeurs du Vieux Monde'', ''La Chôme'' (1984–85), and ''Contre'' (1987–89).

In the 1990s, the French autonomist movement was present in struggles led by unemployed people, with Travailleurs, Chômeurs, et Précaires en colère (TCP, "Angry Workers, Unemployed, and Marginalised people") and l'Assemblée générale des chômeurs de Jussieu ("General Assembly of Jussieu's unemployed people"). It was also involved in the [[alter-globalisation]] movement and above all in the solidarity with illegal foreigners (Collective Des Papiers pour tous ("Permits for all", 1996) and Collectif Anti-Expulsion (1998–2005)). Several autonomist journals date from this time: ''[[Quilombo]]'' (1988–93), ''Apache'' (1990–98), ''Tic-Tac'' (1995–97), ''Karoshi'' (1998–99), and ''Tiqqun'' (1999–2001).

From 19 to 28 July 2002, a [[No borders]] camp was made in [[Strasbourg]] to protest against anti-immigration policies, in particular inside the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen European space]].

In 2003, autonomists came into conflict with the [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialist Party]] (PS) during a demonstration that took place in the frame of the [[European Social Forum]] in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]] (Paris). At the end of December, hundreds of unemployed people helped themselves in the ''[[Bon Marché]]'' supermarket to be able to celebrate Christmas (an action called "''[[autoréduction]]''" (of prices) in French). [[Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité|French riot police]] (CRS) physically opposed the unemployed people inside the shop. Autonomes rioted during the [[2006 labour protests in France|spring 2006 protests]] against the [[First Employment Contract|CPE]], and again after the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential election]] when [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] was elected.

On 11 November 2008, the French police arrested ten people, including five living in a farmhouse on a hill overlooking Tarnac, and accused them of associating with a "terrorist enterprise" by sabotaging TGV's overhead lines. Nine out of ten were let go and only [[Julien Coupat]], the alleged leader, remained in custody for about a year, charged with "directing a terrorist group" by the Paris Prosecutor's office.

==The German ''Autonome'' movement in the 1970s and 1980s==
In Germany, ''Autonome'' was used during the late 1970s to depict the most radical part of the political left.&lt;ref&gt;''FIRE AND FLAMES: A History of the German Autonomist Movement'' by Geronimo. AK Press. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals participated in practically all actions of the social movements at the time, especially in demonstrations against [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] plants (Brokdorf 1981, Wackersdorf 1986) and in actions against the construction of airport runways (Frankfurt 1976–86). The defense of [[Squatting|squats]] against the police such as in [[Hamburg]]'s ''Hafenstraße'' was also a major "task" for the "autonome" movement. The Dutch anarchist ''Autonomen'' movement from the 1960s also concentrated on squatting.

Tactics of the "Autonome" were usually militant, including the construction of barricades or throwing stones or [[molotov cocktail]]s at the police. During their most powerful times in the early 1980s, on at least one occasion the police had to take flight.

Because of their outfit (heavy black clothing, ski masks, helmets), the "Autonome" were dubbed ''der schwarze Block'' by the German media, and in these tactics were similar to modern [[black bloc]]s. In 1989, laws regarding demonstrations in Germany were changed, prohibiting the use of so-called "passive weaponry" such as helmets or padding and covering your face.

Today, the "autonome" scene in Germany is greatly reduced and concentrates mainly on [[anti-fascist]] actions, ecology, solidarity with [[refugee]]s, and [[feminism]]. There are larger and more militant groups still in operation, such as in Switzerland or Italy.

==The Greek ''anarcho-autonomoi''&lt;!--Linked from [[Anarchism in Greece]] and [[Squatting]]; redirects here--&gt;==
{{sources|date=November 2018}}
{{Anarcho-communism sidebar|Related}}
{{main|Anarchism in Greece}}
In Greece, the ''anarcho-autonomoi'' (Greek αναρχο-αυτόνομοι "anarchist-autonomists") emerged as an important{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} trend in the youth and student movement, first during the 1973 [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] against the military dictatorship that ruled the country at the time. After the collapse of the dictatorship in 1974, the "anarcho-autonomoi" became considerably influential{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, firstly as a social trend within the youth and then as a (very loose and diverse) political trend. The definition "anarcho-autonomoi", itself, is much debated. One reason for this is that it was originally coined by opponents. However, it was also quite quickly adopted by many adherents, used as a generic term.

Before 1973, in Greece, there was very little tradition in anarchism or libertarian socialism in general. Thus, the radical Greek youth in the 1970s, having very little relative background to refer to, resided to an extensive "syncretism" of multiple trends originating in the respective movements in other European countries. Anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist trends converged with situationist, workerist, or other autonomist trends and even with radical (non-autonomist) Marxist trends. The "anarcho-autonomoi" made a very strong stand{{citation needed} during the 1978–80 student movement, coming into violent confrontation with the police and the (also, of considerable influence) Stalinist communist youth (K.N.E). Such stands were repeated whenever the student, worker, and youth movements were rising (in 1987, 1990–91, 1998–99, and 2006–7). However, their intensity has been falling since 1990–91.

Parallel to such participation in social movements, a large number of social centres (many of them squatted) exist to this day around Greece, and many of them participate in social struggles on a local level. These social centres, whether they now identify as "Autonomist" or not (most use terms such as "anti-authority" (αντιεξουσιαστής), while some identify as "anarchist" ), function in the ways that historically emerged through "Autonomia". There is also a multitude of small political groups which identify as "Autonomist", ranging from workerist to post-modernist. Most of them are still connected to the respective groups that identify as "Anarchist".

The Autonomist Marxist and ''Autonomen'' movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English-speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists{{who|date=January 2013}} even describe themselves as ''Autonomists''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The Italian ''operaismo'' movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright, and Nick Dyer-Witheford.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In Denmark and Sweden, the word is used as a catch-all phrase for anarchists and the extra-parliamentary left in general, as was seen in the media coverage of the eviction of the [[Ungdomshuset]] [[squatting|squat]] in [[Copenhagen]] in March 2007.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

'''''Beyond Capricorn: How Portuguese adventurers secretly discovered and mapped Australia and New Zealand 250 years before Captain Cook''''' is a 2007 book by journalist Peter Trickett on the [[theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia]]. Although its thesis is similar to that advanced by [[Kenneth McIntyre]] in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, K.G (1977) ''The Secret Discovery of Australia, Portuguese ventures 200 years before Cook.'' Souvenir Press, Menindie {{ISBN|0-285-62303-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence Fitzgerald  in 1984&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, L (1984). ''Java La Grande.'' The Publishers, Hobart {{ISBN|0-949325-00-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, the publisher and some news reports&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eaststreet.com.au/gallery.php|title=An Australian publishing house based in South Australia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented it as being a new theory on the discovery of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [https://www.theguardian.com/australia/story/0,,2039850,00.html ''Guardian Unlimited'', 22 March 2007] Several of these reports also claimed the theory "proved" Cook was not the first to discover Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has been translated into Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;''Para além de Capricórnio,'' Lisboa, Caderno, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 May 2008 the [[:wikt:colloquium|colloquium]] of specialists in Portuguese maritime history, "Os Portugueses na Austrália", was held at the [[Science Museum of the University of Coimbra]] in Portugal, to discuss ''Beyond Capricorn''. The consensus of the experts was expressed by the chair of the colloquium, Francisco Domingues, who said: "the Portuguese went to Australia but Australia did not at all interest them", and "the Portuguese went to Australia; the English discovered it (in the sense of having given to it a place in the community of nations)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publico.pt/2008/05/08/culturaipsilon/noticia/os-portugueses-estiveram-na-australia-os-ingleses-descobriramna-1328179|title=“Os portugueses estiveram na Austrália; os ingleses descobriram-na”|first=Susana Almeida|last=Ribeiro|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the essays, opinions and discussions presented on the colloquium were collected in a book entitled "Portugueses na Austrália", published by Coimbra University Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.pt/imprensa_uc/catalogo/documentos/australia|title=Universidade de Coimbra - Imprensa da Universidade - Portugueses na Austrália: as primeiras viagens|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

[[File:Australia first map.jpg|thumb|The Terra Java section of the [[Vallard atlas]], which is identified by Peter Trickett as the east coast of Australia. South is at the top.]]

The title of the book refers to the sixteenth century [[Dieppe maps]] of France which in part show land in a continent extending south of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] that is in the area of Australia. Trickett claims that the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first Europeans to discover Australia, between 1519–23, well before the first recognised landfall of Europeans in Australia in 1606 by [[Willem Janszoon]]. According to Trickett, a  1520 expedition searching for gold and led by [[Diogo Pacheco]] (a relative of [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira|Duarte Pacheco]]), may have been the first Europeans to sight Australia, in the present-day [[Kimberley region of Western Australia]]. Using an account from [[João de Barros]]'s ''Décadas da Ásia'', a 1786 history of the Portuguese empire in Asia,  Trickett argues Pacheco was killed at [[Carronade Island|Napier Broome Bay]], in a battle with [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]].&lt;ref&gt;Trickett, P. (2007) pps 37-70&lt;/ref&gt; Trickett claims the [[Carronade Island]] cannons originate from this voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Trickett, P. (2007) pps 39-48. Trickett dismisses the 1980s research into the Carronade Island Cannons by Jeremy Green, see footnote on pps353-355. For Green's 2006 publication on the cannons, which Trickett apparently did not consult, see  [http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/collections/maritime/march/documents/No.%20215%20Carronade%20Is%20Gun.pdf "An investigation of one of the two bronze guns from Carronade Island, Western Australia"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the book, however, focuses on the claimed voyage of a fleet of four ships commanded by [[Cristóvão de Mendonça]], along the eastern and southern coasts of Australia then to New Zealand shortly afterwards, and another Portuguese voyage along the west coast. Trickett uses one of the Dieppe maps in the highly decorated [[Vallard atlas|"Vallard"]] atlas of 1547 to demonstrate this. Trickett claims that Mendonça travelled down the east coast of Australia, sailing into [[Botany Bay]] and then around [[Wilsons Promontory]] to [[Kangaroo Island]], before returning to Portuguese-controlled [[Malacca]] via the [[North Island of New Zealand]]. He also claims the Portuguese charted the [[Western Australia]]n coast, as far south as the southwest tip of Australia. Trickett claims that the French Vallard maps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunsite3.berkeley.edu/hehweb/HM29.html|title=Digital Scriptorium|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were composed of several [[portolan chart]]s that were incorrectly assembled from now lost Portuguese charts. Trickett adjusts parts of the Vallard maps by rotating them 90 degrees, giving what he claims is a remarkably accurate depiction of Australia's eastern, southern, and western coasts.

Trickett goes through almost every written location on the Vallard maps, giving an English translation and explaining where he believes the place is located. He also mentions the mythical [[Mahogany Ship]], the ruins at [[Bittangabee Bay]] on the south coast of [[New South Wales]], various Aboriginal legends and alleged linguistic similarities, and various artefacts found in Queensland and New Zealand which he claims pre-date known European exploration, as further evidence of a Portuguese discovery of Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=131208&amp;term=spanish%20helmet,|title=Object: Iron helmet (known as the &amp;quot;Spanish&amp;quot; helmet) - Collections Online - Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== An example: Botany Bay ==

[[File:Vallard map rotated.jpg|thumb|Trickett's adjusted Vallard map, with the southern section rotated 90 degrees. Wilsons Promontory is depicted some 2,000 kilometres south of its actual position.]]

In the publicity campaign surrounding the release of the book, several media reports mentioned Trickett’s claim that the Vallard map accurately showed [[Botany Bay]] to the point where [[Sydney Airport]] runways could be drawn on it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSSYD3449720070321  Reuters report by Michael Perry.] Widely copied by other sources on the web.&lt;/ref&gt; Trickett’s Botany Bay is "Baia Neve" on the Vallard Map, and on p.&amp;nbsp;155 Trickett provides a sketch map of the bay with Sydney Airport runways drawn on it to the same scale. He acknowledges the bay is "too large to be Botany Bay in relation to the scale of the Vallard map as a whole".&lt;ref&gt;Trickett, P. (2007) p.154-7&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that sixteenth century map-makers "enlarge(d) … important sections of their charts," &lt;ref&gt;Trickett. P. (2007) p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; such as this bay, hence its exaggerated size. The Vallard map original also shows two large islands in the bay and seven islands just outside the mouth of the bay. Trickett identified the islands inside the bay as [[Bare Island (New South Wales)|Bare Island]] and a large mudflat, drying out at low tide, which he believed appeared as a large island to the Portuguese explorers. The seven islands outside the bay he identifies as a misplacing of the Five Islands Group (50&amp;nbsp;km away near [[Wollongong]]); a representation of the [[Sydney Heads#North Head|North Head]] of [[Sydney Harbour]] and a representation of Cape Three Points (now [[Boudi, New South Wales|Boudi]], 70&amp;nbsp;km away near [[Broken Bay]]).

==Criticism of Trickett's theories==

Following its initial reception online and in the popular press, a number of criticisms of the book have appeared, by scholars including Associate Professor (Spanish and Portuguese) W.A.R. "Bill" Richardson.&lt;ref name="RICHARDSON" /&gt; Trickett repeatedly criticises "orthodox academics" for ignoring or denigrating the [[theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;Trickett, P (2007) p.4-5&lt;/ref&gt; while acknowledging that the book is "not written as an academic treatise—it is aimed at a wider audience".&lt;ref&gt;Trickett, P. (2007) p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Trickett’s approach of using only one Dieppe map as the basis for his book, without significant reference to any of the other existing Dieppe maps, has been questioned.&lt;ref name='AGORA'&gt;''Agora'', Vol 42, No. 2, 2007. Journal of the History Teacher's Association of Victoria. Book reviews, P.64. {{ISSN|0044-6726}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vallard map of 1547 is not the first of the Dieppe maps, and Richardson argues Trickett incorrectly "assumes the unknown Vallard cartographer had access to much more information" because it contains more place names.&lt;ref name="RICHARDSON" /&gt; Richardson adds that "the hybrid inscriptions [of the Vallard] are in an astonishing jumble of languages", many of which Trickett misreads or misinterprets; suggesting, for example, that the island ''Illa do Aljofar'' may have Polynesian origins.&lt;ref&gt;Trickett, P. (2007) p.256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson points out the word is Portuguese, of Arabic origin, meaning ‘pearl’ and thus strongly connecting it to [[Hainan]] island.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trickett also reproduces a number of sketch maps, comparing Terra Java/Jave La Grande of the A3-sized pages of the Vallard atlas with modern detailed knowledge of the Australian coast, but without showing any scale. Richardson argues this practice misleads the reader, and he previously argued Kenneth McIntyre’s comparative sketches also misled in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, W.A.R. (2006) ''Was Australia Charted before 1606? The Jave La Grande Inscriptions''. National Library of Australia. p. 48-51 {{ISBN|0-642-27642-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issues in providing such sketch maps for comparison purposes are highlighted in Trickett’s sketch map copy of ''Illa Do Magna'', which he compares to a rough sketch map of New Zealand’s North Island.&lt;ref&gt;Trickett, P. (2007) p.232. Compare the sketch of ''Illa Do Magna'', its scale and orientation, and the treatment of the "Taranaki" section, with the Vallard original&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson adds that the lack of scale used in ''Beyond Capricorn''’s sketch maps causes the reader "to fail to realise that [Trickett’s adjusted] 'Wilsons Promontory' is some 17 degrees, nearly 2,000&amp;nbsp;kilometres, south of the real Wilsons Promontory."&lt;ref name="RICHARDSON" /&gt;

Commenting in 1985 on other writers who compared Australia’s coast with the Dieppe Maps, Richardson wrote, "it is difficult not to express admiration for the extreme ingenuity exercised in their endeavours to 'correct' the Jave La Grande outline in order to compel it to conform more closely to the known outline of Australia."&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, W.A.R, (1985) ''Another Gospel on our discovery by the Portuguese''. The Age, 5 January 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 2007 for an Australian mapmaking journal, he suggested Trickett has also taken an approach of "if evidence does not suit a theory, one solution is to alter it."&lt;ref name="RICHARDSON" /&gt;

In an article in ''The Globe'' in 2009, Robert J. King refers to ''Beyond Capricorn'', arguing that Jave la Grande is a theoretical construction, an artifact of 16th century cosmography. He points out that the geographers and map makers of the Renaissance struggled to bridge the gap from the world view inherited from Graeco-Roman antiquity, as set out in [[Claudius Ptolemy]]'s ''Geography'', and a map of the world that would take account of the new geographical information obtained during the Age of Discoveries. The Dieppe world maps reflected the state of geographical knowledge of their time, both actual and theoretical. Accordingly, Java Major, or Jave la Grande, was shown as a promontory of the undiscovered Antarctic continent of [[Terra Australis]]. King argues that Jave la Grande on the Dieppe maps represents one of Marco Polo's pair of Javas (Major or Minor), misplaced far to the south of its actual location and attached to a greatly enlarged Terra Australis; it does not represent Australia, discovered by unknown Portuguese voyagers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. King, "The Jagiellonian Globe, a Key to the Puzzle of Jave la Grande", ''The Globe: Journal of the [[Australian and New Zealand Map Society|Australian Map Circle]]'', no.62, 2009, pp.1-50. http://search.informit.com.au/fullText;dn=991081461781028;res=IELHSS&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bishop Samuel's inscription''' ({{lang-ka|ეპისკოპოს სამუელის წარწერა}}) is an [[Ancient Greek]] [[limestone]] [[tombstone]] [[Concrete slab|slab]] inscription which was discovered in 1934, in the monastic [[cemetery]] of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, at the [[Jerusalem International YMCA|YMCA]] area in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Tchekhanovets, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription mentions ''"[[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberian]]'' [i.e. Georgian] ''[[bishop]], Samuel"'' and the [[Purchasing|purchase]] of a tomb or a monastery in the [[Tower of David]]. Because of the incorrect Greek, it is unclear if the Iberians bought a tomb or a monastery.&lt;ref&gt;Di Segni &amp; Tsafrir, p. 438&lt;/ref&gt; The slab is partly broken and the whole right corner of it is lost. It is dated to the late 5th or early 6th century AD. The inscription is kept at [[Rockefeller Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;CIIP, p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Black Swans''' ({{lang-bs|Crni labudovi}}) was a special forces unit within the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It was a [[Patriotic League (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Patriotic League]] unit formed in 1992 in [[Sapna]], under the [[2nd Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2nd Corps]] (later [[1st Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|1st Corps]]) which eventually numbered 800 men. It earned a reputation for battlefield bravery. The first commander, [[Senad Mehdin Hodžić]], was a former member of the Special anti-terrorist unit of the Yugoslav Ministry of Internal Affairs ([[Ministry of the Interior (Yugoslavia)|MUP]]). When he took command of the Black Swans, he would be known as "Kapetan Labud" or Captain Swan. Captain [[Hajro Mešić]] then went on to take the commanding position for a while. The most successful and lasting commander was Brigadier [[Hase Tirić]]. The Black Swans' areas of operation included [[Konjic]], [[Igman]] and [[Jablanica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Jablanica]]. The Black Swans wore black uniforms with their respective unit patch on the left sleeve, and the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|ARBIH]] patch on the right sleeve.

[[File:Israelinbritainb00garn 0005.jpg|thumb|An 1890 book advocating British Israelism. According to the doctrine, the Lost Ten tribes of Israel found their way to Western Europe and Britain, becoming the ancestors of the British and related peoples.]]

'''British Israelism''' (also called '''Anglo-Israelism''') is a movement which holds the view that the people of [[England]] (or more broadly, the people of the British Isles) are "genetically, racially, and linguistically the direct descendants" of the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of ancient [[Israelites|Israel]].&lt;ref name="Brackney 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brackney|first1=William H.|title=Historical Dictionary of Radical Christianity|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810873650|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhUvxfkWW2oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA61|accessdate=9 April 2017|language=en|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With roots in the 16th century, British Israelism was inspired by several 19th-century English writings such as John Wilson's 1840 ''Our Israelitish Origin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eller|first1=Jack David|title=Introducing Anthropology of Religion: Culture to the Ultimate|date=2007|isbn=1138024910|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The movement never had a head organisation or a centralized structure.  Various British Israelite organisations were set up throughout the [[British Empire]] as well as in [[United States|America]] from the 1870s; a number of these organisations are active as of the early [[21st century]].  In America, its ideas gave rise to the [[Christian Identity]] movement.

The central tenets of British Israelism have been refuted by evidence from modern [[archaeology|archaeological]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melton|first1=J.

==History of the movement==

===Earliest recorded expressions===
According to Brackney (2012) and Fine (2015), the French [[Hugenots|Hugenot]] magistrate M. le Loyer's ''The Ten Lost Tribes'', published in 1590, provided the first expression that "Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Scandinavian, Germanic, and associated cultures"&lt;ref name="Fine 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fine|first1=Jonathan|year=2015|title=Political Violence in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam: From Holy War to Modern Terror|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442247567|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JjXHBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA176|accessdate=9 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; were direct descendants of the ancient Israelites.&lt;ref name="Brackney 2012"/&gt; Anglo-Israelism has also been attributed to [[Francis Drake]] and [[James VI and I]],&lt;ref name="Fine 2015"/&gt; who believed he was the King of Israel.&lt;ref name="Brackney 2012"/&gt; [[Adriaan van Schrieck]] (1560-1621), who influenced [[Henry Spelman]] (1562-1641) and [[John Sadler (Town Clerk of London)|John Sadler]] (1615-1674), wrote in the early 17th century about his ideas on the origins of the Celtic and Saxon peoples. In 1649, Sadler published ''The Rights of the Kingdom'', "which argues for an 'Israelite genealogy for the British people'".&lt;ref name="Fine 2015"/&gt;

Aspects of British Israelism and its influences have also been traced to [[Richard Brothers]]' ''A Revealed Knowledge of the Prophecies and Times'' in 1794, [[John Wilson (British Israelite)|John Wilson]]'s ''Our Israelitish Origin'' (1840s), and [[John Pym Yeatman]]'s ''The Shemetic Origin of the Nations of Western Europe'' (1879).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Foundation===
British Israelism arose in England, then spread to the United States.&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parfitt|first1=Tudor|title=The lost tribes of Israel : the history of a myth|date=2003|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|isbn=978-1842126653|edition=1st pbk. ed., 2nd impression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–65}}  British-Israelists cite various medieval manuscripts to claim an older origin, but British Israelism as a distinct movement appeared in the early 1880s:

{{Quote|Although scattered British Israel societies are known to have existed as early as 1872, there was at first no real move to develop an organization beyond the small groups of believers which had arisen spontaneously. The beginnings of the movement as an identifiable religious force can, therefore, be more accurately placed in the 1880's when the circumstances of the time were particularly propitious for the appearance of a movement so imperialistically-orientated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=J.|title=British Israelism|journal=The Sociological Review|date=March 1968|volume=16|issue=1|pages=41–57|doi=10.1111/j.1467-954X.1968.tb01291.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Peak adherence, end of the 19th and early 20th centuries===
[[Image:William Pascoe Goard.jpg|thumb|[[William Pascoe Goard]]]]
The extent to which the clergy in Britain became aware of the movement may be gauged from the comment made by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[John Henry Newman]] (1801–1890) when asked why he had left the [[Church of England]] in 1845 to join the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. He said that there was a very real danger that the movement "would take over the Church of England."&lt;ref name=Strong1986&gt;{{cite book|first=Patience|last=Strong|title=Someone had to say it|publisher=Bachman &amp; Turner, London|year=1986|isbn=978-0859741323}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86}}

In the later 19th century, [[Edward Hine]], [[Edward Wheeler Bird]], and [[Herbert Aldersmith]] developed the British Israelite movement.  Hine and Bird would achieve a degree of "doctrinal coherence" by seeing off competing forms of the ideology: in 1878 the Anglo-Ephraim Association of London, which followed Wilson in embraced the broader community of western European [[Germanic peoples]] among those they believed were favored by God, would be absorbed into Bird's Metropolitan Anglo-Israel Association, espousing the Anglo-exclusive view promoted by Hine.&lt;ref name=Kidd2006/&gt;{{rp|209}}

By the 1890s, the "Anglo-Israel Association" had 300 members; it was based in Britain and founded in 1879 by physician [[George Moore (physician)|George Moore]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}  Hine later departed for the United States where he promoted the idea.&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|56}}

The 1906 ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' stated that British Israelism's adherents "are said to number 2,000,000 in England and the United States",&lt;ref name=TJE600&gt;{{cite book |contribution=Anglo-Israelism|last=Jacobs|first=Joseph|title= Jewish Encyclopedia: Anglo-Israelism |editor-first1= Isidore |editor-last1= Singer |editor-link= Isidore Singer |date= 1901 |publisher= [[Funk and Wagnalls]] |location=New York|page= 600 |url= http://d2b4hhdj1xs9hu.cloudfront.net/BJ1J6JJS.jpg |ASIN= B01K2CBAKE |ISBN= 978-1117918952}}&lt;/ref&gt; an unreliable figure if association membership and journal subscription numbers are any guide, though there would have been a broader, unmeasurable sympathy towards the views of the movement among Protestants globally.&lt;ref name=Kidd2006/&gt;{{rp|209}}

Between 1899 and 1902, adherents of British Israelism dug up parts of the [[Hill of Tara]] in the belief that the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was buried there, doing much damage to one of [[Ireland]]'s most ancient royal and archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Indy media | place = [[Ireland|IE]] | url = http://www.indymedia.ie/article/71184}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, British Israelism became associated with various pseudo-archaeological [[pyramidology]] theories, such as the notion that the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Pyramid of Khufu]] contained a prophetic numerology of the [[British peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;Moshenska, G. (2008). 'The Bible in Stone': Pyramids, Lost Tribes and Alternative Archaeologies". ''Public Archaeology''. 7(1): 5–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, the thirty-fourth year of its publication, the ''Anglo-Israel Almanac'' listed details of a large number of Kingdom Identity Groups operating independently throughout the British Isles and in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, and the United States of America.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In 1919, the [[British-Israel-World Federation]] (BIWF) was founded in London, and [[Covenant Publishing]] was founded in 1922. [[William Pascoe Goard]] was the first director of the publishing house. During this time, several prominent figures patronized the BIWF organization and its publisher; [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone]] was Patron-in-chief in pre-World War II days. One of the highest profile members was [[William Massey]], then Prime Minister of [[New Zealand]]. Due to the expansive nature of the [[British Empire]], believers in British Israelism spread worldwide and the BIWF expanded its organization to the commonwealth. Howard Rand promoted the teaching and became National Commissioner of the [[Anglo-Saxon Federation of America]] in 1928. He published ''The Bulletin'', later renamed ''The Messenger of the Covenant''.  More recently, it has been renamed ''Destiny''.&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|57}}

During its peak in the early 20th century, British Israelism was also supported by [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} A prolific author on British Israelism during the later 1930s and 40s was [[Alexander James Ferris]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Contemporary movement==
The BIWF continues to exist, with its main headquarters located in [[Bishop Auckland]] in [[County Durham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishisrael.co.uk/contact.php |title=Contact Us |website=The British-Israel-World Federation |publisher=The British-Israel-World Federation |access-date=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has chapters in Australia, Canada, The Netherlands, New Zealand and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishisrael.co.uk/otherbiwfs.php |title=Other British-Israel Organisations |website=The British-Israel-World Federation |publisher=The British-Israel-World Federation |access-date=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, one source estimated that there were between 3,000 and 5,000 British Israelites in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=J.|title=British Israelism: A Revitalization Movement in Contemporary Culture|journal=Archives de sociologie des religions|date=1 January 1968|volume=13|issue=26|pages=73–80|url=http://www.persee.fr/docAsPDF/assr_0003-9659_1968_num_26_1_1808.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There, the theology of British Israelism has been taught by a few small [[Pentecostal]] churches.  The espousal of British Israelism by [[George Jeffreys (pastor)|George Jeffreys]], founder of the [[Elim Pentecostal Church]], led to a [[schism]], precipitating his 1939 resignation and the formation of the [[Bible-Pattern Church Fellowship]],&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Allan Heaton|title=An Introduction to Pentecostalism: Global Charismatic Christianity|edition=2nd|year=2014|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; which continues to teach the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=B. R.|title=Contagious Conflict: The Impact of American Dissent on European Life|article=American Religion: Its Impact on Britain|editor-last=den Hollander|editor-first=A. N. J.|year=1973|location=Leiden|publisher=E. J. Brill|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herbert Armstrong===

The teaching of British Israelism was vigorously promoted beginning in the 1960s by [[Herbert W. Armstrong]],&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|57}} founder and former Pastor General of the [[Grace Communion International#Worldwide Church of God|Worldwide Church of God]]. Armstrong believed that the teaching was a key to understanding [[biblical]] prophecy: "One might ask, were not biblical prophecies closed and sealed? Indeed they were—until now! And even now they can be understood only by those who possess the master key to unlock them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Armstrong | first = Herbert | title = The United States and Britain in Prophecy|year= 1967|page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong believed that he was called by God to proclaim the prophecies to the [[10 lost tribes|Lost Tribes]] of Israel before the "[[end-times]]".&lt;ref name = "ReferenceA"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.gci.org/prophecy/usb | last = Orr | first = R | title = How Anglo-Israelism Entered Seventh-day Churches of God: A history of the doctrine from John Wilson to Joseph W. Tkach | year = 1999 | accessdate = July 19, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}} Armstrong's belief caused his separation from the [[Church of God (Seventh Day)|Church of God Seventh Day]] because of its refusal to adopt the teaching.

Armstrong created his own church, first called the "Radio Church of God" and later renamed the "[[Worldwide Church of God]]".&lt;ref name = "ReferenceA" /&gt;  He described British Israelism as a "central plank" of his theology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Tkach, Jr.|Joseph Tkach]], [https://www.gci.org/aboutus/truth "Transformed by Truth: The Worldwide Church of God Rejects the Teachings of Founder Herbert W Armstrong and Embraces Historic Christianity. This is the Inside Story"]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Armstrong's death, his former church abandoned its belief in British Israelism and changed its name to [[Grace Communion International]] (GCI) in 2009.  It offers an explanation for the doctrine's origin and its abandonment by the church at its official website.&lt;ref name = "ReferenceA" /&gt; Church members who disagreed with such doctrinal changes left the Worldwide Church of God/GCI to form offshoot churches. Many of these organizations still teach British Israelism, including the [[Philadelphia Church of God]], the [[Living Church of God]], and the [[United Church of God]]. Armstrong promoted other genealogical history theories, such as teaching the belief that modern-day [[Germany]] represents ancient [[Assyria]], writing "The Assyrians settled in central Europe, and the Germans, undoubtedly, are, in part, the descendants of the ancient Assyrians.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Herbert|title=Mystery of the Ages|year=1985|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenets==

===All Israelites Are Not Jews===
Adherents believe the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]] are the twelve sons of the patriarch [[Jacob]] (who was later named Israel). Jacob elevated the descendants of [[Ephraim]] and [[Manasseh]] (the two sons of Joseph) to the status of full tribes in their own right, replacing the tribe of Joseph.
A division occurred among the twelve tribes in the days of [[Jeroboam]] and [[Rehoboam]], with the three tribes of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]], [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]] and partially [[Tribe of Levi|Levi]], forming the [[Kingdom of Judah]], and the remaining ten tribes forming the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Britannica|page=vol. 15, p. 373|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they argue, "the great bulk of Israelites are not the Jews".&lt;ref name=Allen1917&gt;{{Cite book|last=Allen|first=J.H.|title=Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright|publisher=Destiny Publishers|year=1917|isbn=|edition=16|location=Haverhill, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71}}
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Harmsworth’s History Volume 3|pages=1781–1782, 1784–1785}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The DNA of Western European Nations|url=http://www.british-israel.com/dna-and-british-israel.html|website=British Israel Basics|publisher=Canadian British-Israel Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  W. E. Filmer, writing in 1964, suggested that the fact that some Jews continue to search for the ten lost tribes implies that their representatives are not found among modern, historically multi-ethnic, Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Filmer|first1=W. E.|title=A Synopsis of the Migrations of Israel|date=1964|publisher=Covenant Books|isbn=0852050615|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of British-Israelites quote [[Josephus]] to support their claim that the lost tribes of Israel are not the Jews: "the entire body of the people of Israel remained in that country; wherefore there are but two tribes in Asia and Europe subject to the Romans, while the ten tribes are beyond the Euphrates till now, and are an immense multitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Josephus|first1=Flavius|title=Antiquities|page=11:133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen1917/&gt;{{rp|247}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-israel.ca/answers.htm|title=British-Israel Answers its Critics|last=|first=|date=|website=The British-Israel Church of God|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poole|first1=William Henry|title=Anglo-Israel; Or, The British Nation the Lost Tribes of Israel|date=1879|publisher=Bengough Bros.|isbn=1330950690|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British descent from the Lost Tribes===
[[File:Jehu-Obelisk-cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Jehu]] kneeling at the feet of [[Shalmaneser III]] on the [[Black Obelisk]].]]
The key component of British Israelism is its representation of the migrations of the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]]. Adherents suggested that the [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]] and [[Goths]] were representatives of these lost tribes, and progenitors of the later invaders of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chryssides|first=George D.|title=Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements|publisher=The Scarecros Press, Inc.|location=Lanham|year=2012|page=65|isbn=9780810861947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Quarles/&gt;{{rp|26–27}}  John Wilson would argue for the inclusion of all Western European Gothic peoples among the descendants of the Israelites, but under the later influence of Edward Hine the movement would come to view only the peoples of the British Isles as having this ancestry.&lt;ref name=Kidd2006/&gt;{{rp|209}}

[[File:Declaration of arbroath.jpg|thumb|The 'Tyninghame' copy of the Declaration from 1320 AD]]

Bede (died 735) had linked the [[Picts]] to the Scythians, but British Israelists suggested that he had confused the two tribes of Scotland, and that it was the ''Scotti'' (Scots) who were one with the ''Scoloti'' (Scyths) of Herodotus.&lt;ref name=Merrill&gt;{{cite book|last=Merrill|first=A. H.|title=History and Geography in Late Antiquity|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2005|pages=284–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They drew particular support from the derivation of the Scots from the Scythians found in the 1320 [[Declaration of Arbroath]],&lt;ref name=Allen1917/&gt;{{rp|262}} reflecting a tradition related in the 9th-century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' that the Scots descended from the union of a Scythian exile with Scota, daughter of a [[Pharaoh]], a tale found in some form in several other early-14th-century historical and poetic sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Broun|first=Dauvit|title=The Irish Identity of the Kingdom of the Scots in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries|publisher=Boydell Press|location=Woodbridge, England|year=1999|pages=78–79,119–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration begins:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Most Holy Father and Lord, we know and from the chronicles and books of the ancients we find that among other famous nations our own, the Scots, has been graced with widespread renown. They journeyed from Greater Scythia by way of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] and the [[Pillars of Hercules]], and dwelt for a long course of time in Spain among the most savage tribes, but nowhere could they be subdued by any race, however barbarous. Thence they came, twelve hundred years after the people of Israel crossed the Red Sea, to their home in the west where they still live today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of Arbroath - English Translation|url=http://www.constitution.org/scot/arbroath.htm|website=Constitution Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

British-Israel Associations cite the Declaration as evidence for the link between the Scots and the Scythians, and hence the Lost Tribes,&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{Cite book|title="Lost Israelite Identity": The Hebraic Ancestry of Celtic Races|last=Davidy|first=Yair|publisher=Brit-Am|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=240-242}}, {{cite book|last1=Ogwyn|first1=John H.|title=The United States and Britain in Prophecy|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as had been proposed by the early British Israelist etymologists.&lt;ref name=Allen1917/&gt;{{rp|285–296}}

Other [[Celts|Celtic invaders]] would be given an analogous descent.  In the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] (''Cymry'') the British Israelists would see a direct connection through the [[Cimbri]] to the [[Cimmerians]], the ''Gimirri'' of [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] annals,&lt;ref name=Pierard1996&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierard|first=Richard V.|contribution=The Contribution of British-Israelism to anti-Semitism within conservative Protestantism|title=Holocaust and church struggle: religion, power and the politics of resistance|editor-last=Locke|editor-first=Hubert G.|editor-last2=Littell|editor-first2=Marcia Sachs|publisher=University Press of America|year=1996|pages=44–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}} a name sometimes also given by the ancient [[Babylonians]] to the Scythians and Saka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gershevych|first=Ilya|title=The Cambridge History of Iran, volume 2: The Median and Achaemenian Periods|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1985|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived similarity between this and the name by which the Assyrian annals referred to Israel, ''Beth Khumbree'', would lead the British Israelists to claim that the Welsh too were members of the Lost Tribes.&lt;ref name=Pierard1996/&gt;{{rp|57}}

According to the Anglo-Israelists, these claimed connections would make the British the literal descendants of the Lost Tribes, and thus inheritors of the promises made to the Israelites in the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{book cite|last=Katz|first=David S.|contribution=Israel in America: The Wanderings of Lost Ten Tribes from ''Mikveigh Yisrael'' to Timothy McVeigh|title=The Jews and the Expansion of Europe to the West, 1450 to 1800|editor-last=Bernardini|editor-first=Paolo|editor-last2=Fiering|editor-first2=Norman|publisher=[[Berghahn Books]]|location=New York|year=2001|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some adherents further claim that the [[British Royal Family]] is directly descended from the line of [[David|King David]].  Citing the ''[[Book of Jeremiah]]'', they claim that the daughters of [[Zedekiah]] fled to Egypt, then 'the isles' in the sea, which they interpret as Ireland.  The descendants of these princesses are said to have crossed to England where they became ancestors of the monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hexham|first=Irving|contribution=British Israelism|title=Evangelical Dictionary of Theology|edition=2|editor-last=Elwell|editor-first=Walter A.|publisher=Baker Book House Company|location=Grand Rapids, MI|year=2001|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Stone of Scone]], used in coronations of Scottish, English and British monarchs for centuries, is claimed to be none other than the [[Stone of Jacob|pillow stone]] used by biblical patriarch, Jacob.&lt;ref name="Brackney 2012" /&gt;

Adherents believe that these blessings have continued down through the ages to modern times, with the British Monarchy identified as the continued blessing upon Judah, and both Britain (Ephraim) and the USA (Manasseh) as recipients of the national birthright blessing. 
They cite passages such as 1 Chron 5:1-2 and  Gen 48:19-20 as supporting this.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Relation to Christian Identity==

Early British Israelites such as [[Edward Hine]] and [[John Wilson (historian)|John Wilson]] were [[Philo-Semitism|philo-semites]].&lt;ref name=Gardell&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardell|first=Mattias|title=Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|year=2003|page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Quarles/&gt;{{rp|33}} British Israelism itself had several Jewish members and it received support from [[rabbi]]s throughout the 19th century.  Within British politics, the movement supported [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who was descended from [[Sephardi Jews]],&lt;ref name=Quarles/&gt;{{rp|13–19}}&lt;ref&gt;''Life From The Dead'', 1875, Vol. III, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; while they also favoured [[Theodor Herzl]] in his advocacy of [[Zionism]].&lt;ref name=Gardell /&gt;  Still, below the surface there had existed an anti-semitic strain such as in the [[scientific racialism]] that led Wilson to deny the 'racial purity' of modern Jews, leading to the view more broadly within the movement that modern Jews were 'un-Semitic impostors'.&lt;ref name=Kidd2006&gt;

{{quote|Once on American shores, British-Israelism began to evolve. Originally, believers viewed contemporary Jews as descendants of those ancient Israelites who had never been "lost." They might be seen critically but, given their significant role in the British-Israel genealogical scheme, not usually with animosity.

== Claims and criticism {{anchor|Claims and criticism}} ==
British Israelism has been criticized for poor research and scholarship. The ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' summarises in 1910 that: "The theory [of British-Israelism] rests on premises which are deemed by scholars - both theological and anthropological - to be utterly unsound".&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia Britannica. 11th edn. 1910. Vol.II, page 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Current scholarship is not consistent with the claims of British Israelism, with scholars drawing attention to its "historical and linguistic inaccuracies" in addition to its links to antisemitism.&lt;ref name="Brackney 2012" /&gt;  Hale (2015) refers to "the overwhelming cultural, historical and genetic evidence against it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hale|first1=Amy|editor1-last=Parker|editor1-first=Joanne|title=The Harp and the Constitution: Myths of Celtic and Gothic Origin|date=2016|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|isbn=9789004306370|language=English|chapter=Reigning with Swords of Meteoric Iron: Archangel Michael and the British New Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|181}}

===Research standards===
Critics of British Israelism note that the arguments presented by promoters of the teaching are based on unsubstantiated and highly speculative amateur research. [[Tudor Parfitt]], author of ''The Lost Tribes: The History of a Myth'', states that the proof cited by adherents of British Israelism is "of a feeble composition even by the low standards of the genre."&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|61}}

===Historical linguistics===
Some proponents of British Israelism have claimed numerous links in [[historical linguistics]] between ancient Hebrew and various European place names and languages.&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|62}} This can be traced to the works of John Wilson in the 19th century. Wilson, who was self-trained, looked for similarities in the sounds of words and argued that many Scottish, British and Irish words stemmed from ancient Hebrew. Wilson's publications inspired the development of British Israel language associations in Europe.&lt;ref name=Quarles&gt;{{cite book | last = Quarles | first = Chester L | title = Christian Identity: The Aryan American Bloodline Religion | publisher = McFarland &amp; co | year = 2004 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=r5BzY2eeyngC | isbn = 978-0-78641892-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}}

Modern scholarly linguistic analysis shows conclusively that the languages of the British Isles ([[English Language|English]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], and [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]]) belong to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family, while Hebrew is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]] of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warf|first=Barney|title=Encyclopedia of Human Geography|article=Language, Geography of|year=2006|location=Thousand Oaks CA|publisher=SAGE Publications|pages=270–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, T. R. Lounsbury stated that “no trace of the slightest real connection can be discovered” between English and ancient Hebrew,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Lounsbury | first= T|title=History of the English Language|year= 1906|pages= 1, 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Michael Friedman in 1993 wrote of the claims that Hebrew was closely related to [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] that "the actual evidence could hardly be any weaker".&lt;ref name=Quarles/&gt;{{rp|33}}

Others have addressed the specific word relationships proposed.  Russell Spittler (1973) says of the "disputable" etymological claims made by the British Israelists that they "have no ample basis in linguistic scholarship and are based on coincidences only."&lt;ref name=Spittler /&gt;  William Ingram (1995) would present arguments made by British Israelism as examples of "tortured etymology".&lt;ref name=Ingram /&gt;{{rp|121}}

===Scriptural interpretation===
Adherents of British Israelism cite various scriptures in support of the argument that the "lost" Northern Israelite Tribes migrated through Europe to end up in Britain.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}  Dimont (1933) argues that British Israelists misunderstand and misinterpret the meaning of these scriptures.&lt;ref name=Dimont1933&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dimont|first1=Charles T. |title=The legend of British-Israel|publisher=Society For Promoting Christian Knowledge|location=London|year=1933|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5–7}}

One such case is the distinction that British Israelists make between the “[[Jews]]” of the Southern Kingdom and the “[[Israelites]]” of the Northern Kingdom. They believe that the [[Bible]] consistently distinguishes the two groups.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}  Dimont says that many of these scriptures are misinterpreted because the distinction between “Jews” and “Israelites” was lost over time after the captivities.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

British Israelists believe that the Northern Tribes of Israel lost their identity after the captivity in Assyria and that this is reflected in the Bible. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Dimont disagrees with this assertion and argues that only higher ranking Israelites were deported from Israel and many Israelites remained.&lt;ref name=Dimont1933/&gt;{{rp|5}} He cites examples after the Assyrian captivity, such as [[Josiah]], King of Judah, who received money from the tribes of ''“Manasseh, and Ephraim and all the remnant of Israel”'' (2 Chronicles 34:9), and Hezekiah, who sent invitations not only to Judah, but also to northern Israel for the attendance of a [[Passover]] in [[Jerusalem]]. (2 Chronicles 30);&lt;ref name=Dimont1933/&gt;{{rp|6}} British Israelites interpret 2 Chronicles 34:9 as referring to "Scythians".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Dimont is also critical of the interpretations of biblical prophecy embraced by the movement, saying, "Texts are torn from their context, and misapplied without the slightest regard to their original meaning."&lt;ref name=Dimont1933/&gt;{{rp|18}}

===Historical speculation===
British Israelism rests on linking different ancient populations. This includes linking the "lost" tribes of Israel with the [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Celts]], and modern [[Western Europe]]ans such as the British. To support these links, some adherents believe that similarities exist between various cultural aspects of these population groups, and they argue that these links demonstrate the migration of the "lost" Israelites in a westerly direction. Examples given include [[burial]] customs, metalwork, clothing, dietary customs, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = UCG | url = http://www.ucg.org/booklets/US/archaelogical.htm | title = The United States and Britain in Bible Prophecy | accessdate = 2009-01-14 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205163627/http://www.ucg.org/booklets/us/archaelogical.htm# | archive-date = 2008-12-05 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dimont argues that the customs of the Scythians and the Cimmerians are in contrast with those of the Ancient Israelites,&lt;ref name=Dimont1933/&gt;{{rp|7–10}} and he further dismisses the connection between these populations and the Saxons and Celts, particularly criticing then-current formulations of British Israelism that would interject Semites between the closely related English and Germans.&lt;ref name=Dimont1933/&gt;{{rp|10–11}}

The Scythian origin of the Scots has been referred to as mythical.&lt;ref name=Todd1848&gt;{{cite book|last=Todd|first=James Henthorn|title=The Irish Version of the Historia Britonum of Nennius|year=1848|publisher=Irish Archæological Society|location=Dublin|p=xcvii|chapter=Editor's Preface|url=https://archive.org/details/irishversionhis00socigoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Klieforth&gt;{{cite book|last=Klieforth|first=Alexander Leslie|last2=Munro|first2=Robert John|title=The Scottish invention of America, Democracy and Human Rights: A History of Liberty and Freedom from the Ancient Celts to the New Millennium|publisher=University Press of America, Inc.|location=Dallas|year=2004|page=5|isbn=978-0761827917}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Algernon Herbert, writing in 1848, characterized the linguistic derivation of Scots from ''Scoloti'' as "strictly impossible",&lt;ref name=Todd1848 /&gt; and Merrill (2005) referred to it as [[false etymology]].&lt;ref name=Merrill /&gt;

Addressing their view on the fate of the exiled tribes, Frank Boys would refer to their volumous output, "All the effort to write these volumes might well have been saved on the premise that 'they were never lost,' which we believe to be the correct one."&lt;ref name=Spittler /&gt;

===Ideology===
Parfitt suggests that the idea of British Israelism was inspired by numerous ideological factors, such as the desire for ordinary people to have a glorious ancestral past, pride in the British Empire, and the belief in the "racial superiority of [[white Anglo-Saxon Protestant]]s",&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|62}}    and Aikau characterized the movement as "fundamentally about providing a rationale for Anglo-Saxon superiority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aikau|first= Hokulani K.|title=A Chosen People, a Promised Land: Mormonism and Race in Hawai'i|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|year=2012|page=38|isbn=978-0-8166-7462-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Kidd, its theology represents a "quasi-[[heresy]]", serving to "blunt the universalist message apparent in the [[New Testament]]".&lt;ref name=Kidd2006/&gt;{{rp|204}}  Its role in fostering [[Antisemitism|anti-semitism]] in conservative [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity]] has been highlighted,&lt;ref name=Pierard1996/&gt;{{rp|57}} as has a "racial [[chauvinism]]" that is "not always covert".&lt;ref name=Ingram/&gt;{{rp|121–122}}

Separately, the mythology of British Israelism has been cited as fostering "nationalistic bellicosity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Meic|last=Pearse|title=The Gods of War: Is Religion the Primary cause of Violent Conflict?|publisher=[[InterVarsity Press]]|year=2007|pages=104–105|isbn=978-0830834907}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To some adherents, British Israelism served as a justification for British [[colonialism]] and [[imperialism]], and perhaps even [[genocide]], while also feeding American [[Manifest Destiny]].&lt;ref name=Kidd2006/&gt;{{rp|212–213}}

'''Caroline Elizabeth Playne''' (1857–1948) was an [[England|English]] [[pacifist]] and [[historian]].&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{citation |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Sybil Oldfield |title=‘Playne, Caroline Elizabeth (1857–1948)’ |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38530 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/38530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playne's 1925 book ''The Neuroses of the Nations'' used [[Psychoanalysis|Freudian psychology]] to put forward a critique of warfare. &lt;ref&gt;Charles Chatfield and R.M. Ili︠u︡khina, '' Peace/mir : An Anthology of Historic Alternatives to War''.  Syracuse, N.Y. : Syracuse University Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0815626010}} (pp. 230-2, 238-40)&lt;/ref&gt;

Caroline Playne approached the pacifist militancy first towards 1904, when she became a founding member of the Britain's National Peace Council, created to support the action of the international court in The Hague. In 1908 she took part in the International Congress for Peace in London, and on this occasion she met the Austrian pacifist Bertha von Suttner, of whom years later she wrote a biography. At the outbreak of the First World War, of which she had long had the presentiment, Playne engaged in relief activities of  internees and prisoners of war, she continued as she could the pacifist militancy, and collected a large amount of materials and observations on the description of the psychological context of English society during the war. After the war she wrote her observations in five volumes in which there is the still embryonic attempt to give life to a psychological and anthropological theory of war, and there are innumerable observations of great acuteness on the English social life before and during the war, thanks to which Playne's work conserves at least a considerable document value.

A '''Chinese era name''' is the [[regnal year]], reign period, or regnal title used when traditionally numbering years in an emperor's reign and naming certain Chinese rulers.  Some emperors have several era names, one after another, where each beginning of a new era resets the numbering of the year back to year one or ''yuán'' (元). The numbering of the year increases on the [[Chinese New Year|first day of the Chinese calendar]] each year. The era name originated as a [[motto]] or [[slogan]] chosen by an emperor.

==Function==
[[Emperor Wu of Han]] was conventionally regarded as the first emperor to declare an era name; however he was only the first to use an era name in every year of his reign. His [[Han Wendi|grandfather]] and [[Han Jingdi|father]] also employed era names, though not continuously. Emperor Wu changed period titles every five years or so, going through a total of eleven reigning slogans during his reign from 140 BC to 87 BC.

Each era name has a literary meaning. For instance, the first era name of Emperor Wu was ''Jianyuan'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|建|元}}}}, ''jiànyuán''), literally meaning "establishing the Origin". Era names also reflected characteristics of political and other landscapes at the time. ''Jianzhongjingguo'' (建中靖國 jiàn zhōng jìng guó), the first era name of [[Emperor Huizong of Song China]], means "establishing middle, peaceful country", reflecting his idealism towards moderating the rivalry among the [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] [[parties]] on political and social reformation. The very first era name of the [[Qing]] was significant because it means "[the Manchus possess] the [[Mandate of Heaven]]". Popular phrases might be repeated, as with the numerous [[Taiping Era (disambiguation)|Taiping era]]s ({{abbr|lit|literally}}. "Era of Great Peace").

The process of era name declaration was referred to in traditional Chinese [[history]] texts as ''jianyuan''. Declaring a new era name to replace an old one during an emperor's reign was referred to as ''gaiyuan'' (改元 gǎi yuán), literally meaning "change the Origin".

To name a year using an era name only requires counting years from the first year of the era. For example, 138 BC was the third year of ''Jianyuan'' (建元), since 140 BC was the first year. When more than one monarch used the same motto, the [[name]] of the specific monarch or dynasty has to be mentioned. For instance both Emperor Wu and [[Jin Kangdi]] picked ''Jianyuan'' as their motto. Thus {{nowrap|AD 344}} was the second year of Jianyuan of the Jin Dynasty (or of Jin Kangdi) whereas 139 BC was the second year of Jianyuan of the Han Dynasty (or of Emperor Wu). In traditional literature, one can therefore find references like "the first month of the thirteenth year of Jianyuan" (建元十三年元月).

Almost all era names have exactly two [[Chinese character|character]]s. Notable exceptions are from the non-[[Han Chinese]] [[Western Xia Dynasty]] (1032–1227). Of the 33 Western Xia era names, seven have more than three characters. For example: 
* Tiancilishengguoqing (天賜禮盛國慶 tiān cì lǐ shèng guó qìng) (1070) "[[Heaven]]-given ritualistic richness, nationally celebrated"
* Tianshoulifayanzuo (天授禮法延祚 tiān shòu lǐ fǎ yán zuò) (1038)  "Heaven-instructed rituals and [[law]]s, perpetually blessed"

Before the [[Ming dynasty]], an emperor often changed his era name as often as he liked. The numbering of the year still increases on the first day of the Chinese calendar each year, regardless of the month in which the era name change took place. For example, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] changed his era name, Xiantian (先天, [[pinyin]]: xiān tiān) to Kaiyuan (開元, [[pinyin]]: kāi yuán) in the twelfth (i.e. last) month of the [[Chinese calendar]]. The second year of Kaiyuan (開元二年) began on the first day of the next month (i.e. Chinese New Year's Day); this made the first year of Kaiyuan (開元元年) consist of only the last few days in the twelfth month following the name change.

==History==

[[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] emperors generally used only one era name during their reign, and it is customary to refer to Ming and Qing emperors by their era names. When an emperor died, his successor would adopt a new era name, but the numbering of the new era name would only begin on the next New Year's Day. For example, when the [[Kangxi Emperor]] of Qing acceded the throne in 1661, it was a few days after New Year's Day, so the [[Shunzhi Emperor|Shunzhi]] era continued for the rest of the year, and the first year of Kangxi (康熙元年) would only start on New Year's Day the following year, in 1662. Exceptions to this are the [[Taichang Emperor]] of the Ming (being dead after reigning for only one month, his successor decreed that the Taichang era name be used for the rest of the year), the [[Zhengtong Emperor]] of the Ming and [[Hung Taiji]] of the Qing (both used two era names).

An era name was a symbol of imperial power. Declaration of another era name when one was already in use was regarded as a challenge to the current emperor. The existence of more than one era name at a time often reflected political unrest. In addition, using a particular era name was a political act implying recognition of a sovereign's right to rule, and one issue that traditional Chinese historians faced was which set of era names to use when dating a historical event. For example, when the [[Yongle Emperor]] of the Ming usurped his nephew, the [[Jianwen Emperor]]'s throne in 1402, he ordered all records of the four-year-reign of the Jianwen Emperor to be dated as year 32 through year 35 of the [[Hongwu Emperor]] (the emperor preceding Jianwen Emperor)'s reign, in order to establish himself as the legitimate successor of the Hongwu Emperor.

Era names were also employed (under different naming conventions) in other [[East Asia]]n countries such as [[Korean era name|Korea]], [[Japanese era name|Japan]] and [[Vietnamese era name|Vietnam]], mostly because of China's cultural influence. Imperial era names are still used in Japan. The [[Minguo calendar|Republic of China Era]], used in China from 1912-1949, and still used in Republic of China (ROC), marks years as ''Minguo'' (i.e. the Republic), which is usually regarded as an era name. For example, the 1st year of the "Republic Era" was 1912.  Therefore, {{CURRENTYEAR}} is "the {{ordinal|{{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1911}}}} year of the Republic Era" (民國{{#expr:{{currentyear}}-1911}}年).  On the mainland, era names were abolished with the adoption of the Common Era at the founding of the People's Republic in 1949.

==Era system versus Western dating system==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
While the era system is a more traditional system of dating that preserves Chinese and Japanese culture, it presents a problem for the more globalized Asian society and for everyday life.

For example, even though within the nation people will know what era they are in, it is relatively meaningless for other nations. In addition, while Republic of China (ROC) and Japan only recognize documents dated in the Era System, their treaties with other countries are in the [[Dionysian Era]] ([[Anno Domini|AD]]) system. In modern times, only Republic of China and Japan still continue to use the ancient Chinese era naming system.

Even in the domestic arena, the era system can present difficult dilemmas. For example, in Japan, it is difficult to keep track of the age of people who were born in the previous era. Also, while ROC and Japan both continue to use the ancient Chinese era system, since they have partially adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]] for non-governmental use, it is more difficult to track down dates that fall on February 29 [[leap year]] in the Western calendar.

Furthermore, in Japan, in theory it is difficult to mention future dates since it is sometimes hard to tell whether the current emperor will live long enough for its citizens to use that era name. However, in practice, documents like driver's licenses and 50-year leases use era dates without regard to this problem.

On the other hand, others{{who|date=August 2015}} suggest that the AD system has too much Christian connotation behind it and it is a form of [[cultural imperialism]] when an essentially European system of dating is forced upon other civilizations with their own long-used and equally legitimate dating systems. However, with globalization, the AD system is becoming more acceptable in Japan and the ROC.

Modern history researchers do not care about era names except for supporting other arguments, such as figuring out the biases and attitudes of a particular historian;{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} however, era names are useful for dating events that were unique in Chinese history. Most [[Chinese dictionaries]] have a comprehensive list of era names, while booklets of more detailed and often searchable lists can be found in [[library|librari]]es.

The '''''Chronicle of Moissac''''' (also known as '''''Chronicon Moissiacense''''') is an anonymous compilation that was discovered in the [[Moissac Abbey|abbey of Moissac]], but is now thought to have been compiled in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] monastery of [[Ripoll]] in the end of the tenth century.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=6}} Like most [[chronicle]]s, it begins with [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], but gains increasing interest for historians as it nears its end date of 828. Unfortunately the entries covering the years 716-770 are missing.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=6}} The only surviving manuscript of the ''Chronicle of Moissac'' dates from the 11th century and is now in the French National Library in Paris (Cod. Paris. lat. 4886).

The compiler seems to have used early annals that had been compiled in southwest [[Francia]], otherwise untraced, which contribute as primary sources for the career of [[Charlemagne]] and the military, political and ecclesiastical history of his times.

The '''''Chronicon Gothanum''''' or '''''Historia langobardorum codicis gothani''''' (''HLCGoth.'') is a history of the [[Lombard people]] written at and for the court of King [[Pippin of Italy]] between the years 806 and 810. It is preserved in one twelfth-century [[codex]], Forschungsbibliothek 84 at [[Gotha]], from which it gets its Latin names.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicon Gothanum'' means "chronicle of Gotha", and ''Historia langobardorum codicis gothani'' means "history of the Lombards from the codex of Gotha". The manuscript is sometimes called the ''[[Codex Gothanus]]''. The  chronicle is not titled in the manuscript; it was given a title by its editors.&lt;/ref&gt; The text is ideologically pro-[[Carolingian]], and among its sources are [[Isidore of Seville]] and possibly [[Jerome]].&lt;ref name="Everett (2003), 93–94"&gt;Everett (2003), 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date, place and author==
The ''Chronicon'' covers the period from the origins of the Lombards to the campaign of Pippin against [[Medieval Corsica|Islamic Corsica]]: "Then the island of Corsica, oppressed by the Moors, his army liberated from their rule."&lt;ref&gt;''Igitur Corsicam insulam a Mauris oppressam suo iussu eiusque exercitus liberavit'', quoted in Berto (2010), 28 n. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign is also recorded in the ''[[Annales regni Francorum]]'', which place it in the year 806.&lt;ref&gt;"That same year, against the Moors on the island of Corsica—which they had devastated—Pippin sent a fleet from Italy, the arrival of which the Moors did not expect and retreated" (''Eodem anno in Corsicam insulam contra Mauros, qui eam vastabant, classis de Italia a Pippino missa est, cuius adventum Mauri non espectantes abscesserunt''), quoted in Berto (2010), 28 n. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''Chronicon'' also praises Pippin as if he is still living,&lt;ref&gt;"This present day by his [Pippin's] help Italy shines, as in ancient days. Law, harvests, peace and quiet she has. . ." (''Praesentem diem per eius adiutorium splenduit Italia, sicut fecit antiquissimis diebus. Leges et ubertates et quietudinem habuit. . .''), quoted in Berto (2010), 28 n. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; it must have been written between the last event it records (806) and his death in 810.&lt;ref name="Berto (2010), 28"&gt;Berto (2010), 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing about the author of the ''Chronicon Gothanum'' is known for certain. His pro-Carolingian stance has led some historians, such as Claudio Azzara and Stefano Gasparri, to believe that he was a [[Franks|Frank]]. Others, such as Stefano Cingolani, Bruno Luiselli and Magali Coumert, believe he was a Lombard, since in one passage he seems to identify with them when he refers to the Lombards during their time in [[Saxony]] as "our ancient forefathers".&lt;ref&gt;"So after struggling they arrived in the Saxon country, at the place called Patespruna ([[Paderborn]]); where our ancient fathers assert they lived a long time" (''sic deinde certantes Saxoni patria attigerunt, locus ubi Patespruna cognominantur; ubi sicut nostri antiqui patres longo tempore asserunt habitasse''), quoted in Berto (2010), 29 n. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Another autobiographical detail is sometimes coaxed from the text when the author says that the remains of the residence of king [[Wacho]] were still visible in his day.&lt;ref&gt;"Thus, even to this present day the remains of King Wacho's palace and residence are visible" (''Unde usque hodie presentem diem Wachoni regi eorum domus et habitatio apparet signa''), quoted in Berto (2010), 29 n. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Wacho was king during the Lombards' stay in [[Pannonia]], and Pippin fought [[De Pippini regis Victoria Avarica|a war with the Avars]] in that region, it is possible that the author was with Pippin on the expedition and saw the remains of the house for himself. It is equally possible that he was merely reporting what he had heard.&lt;ref&gt;Berto (2010), 29 n. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The place of writing is also unknown: Coumert believes the author worked in the [[Abbey of Montecassino]], while [[Walter Pohl]] hypothesised that it took place in [[Milan]] and Luigi Berto agrees that it is probably a north Italian work. Berto also concludes that the author was "probably a member of Pippin's court".&lt;ref&gt;Berto (2010), 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dependence on the ''Origo'' and Paul the Deacon==
Azzara and Gasparri, in a recent [[critical edition]] of Lombard laws, posit that the ''Chronicon Gothanum'' is based in part on the ''[[Origo gentis langobardorum]]'', a position supported by the ''Chronicon''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s initial editor, Friedrich Bluhme, who placed them side by side in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Everett (2003), 93, citing Azzara and Gasparri (eds.), ''Le leggi dei Longobardi: storia, memoria e diritto di un popolo germanico'', Le Fonti 1 (Milan: 1992), 282–91.&lt;/ref&gt; If this were the case, it would provide evidence for the circulation of the ''Origo'' some 150 years before the earliest surviving tenth-century copy, although the original text of the ''Origo'' may have been composed as early as the reign of [[Perctarit]] (671–88). In another critical edition of the ''Origo'', Annalisa Bracciotti hypothesises that a "subarchetype" of the text tradition of the ''Chronicon Gothanum'' circulating in eighth-century Italy was used by [[Paul the Deacon]] for his ''[[Historia langobardorum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Everett (2003), 94, citing Bracciotti, ''Origo gentis langobardorum: introduzione, testo critico, commento'', Biblioteca di Cultura Romanobarbarica 2 (Rome: 1998), 14. A "subarchetype" or "hyperarchetype" is a hypothesised or reconstructed version of a text lying between the original archetype and the final version.&lt;/ref&gt; Cingolani argues that the ''Chronicon'' and the ''Origo'' made use of a common (now lost) source.&lt;ref&gt;Berto (2010), 28, citing Cingolani, ''Le storie dei Longobardi: dall'origine a Paolo Diacono'' (Rome: 1995), 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Berto says that the ''Origo'' and "some other unknown texts" were the sources used by the author of the ''Chronicon''.&lt;ref name="Berto (2010), 28"/&gt;

Nicholas Everett believes that rather than drawing on the ''Origo'' or some earlier "Ur-''Origo''", the ''Chronicon Gothanum'' could have borrowed just as easily from Paul the Deacon, a theory also suggested by [[Walter Goffart]].&lt;ref&gt;Goffart (1988), 382 n. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chronicon'' does not contain the story of [[Woden]] and [[Frea]] that the ''Origo'' does, and it borrows text ''verbatim'' from Isidore explaining the original name of the Lombards (''Winili'') as derived from a river ''Vindilicus'' on the edges of Gaul and describing them as "prone to long beards and never shorn" (''ad barba prolixa et numquam tonsa'').&lt;ref name="Everett (2003), 93–94"/&gt; 

Among the stories that may have been borrowed from Paul, the ''Chronicon'' blames the Romans' weakness in the face of the Lombard invasion of Italy on a pestilence that occurred during the time of [[Narses]],&lt;ref&gt;Goffart (1988), 390 n. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; and the legendary [[Germanic hero]] [[Walter of Aquitaine|Walter]] is an early king of the Lombards.&lt;ref&gt;Learned (1892), 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chronicon'' also follows Paul in praising the heretical King [[Rothari]] because of his legislation, the ''[[Edictum Rothari]]'': "In the time of King Rothari, a light arose in the darkness; through him, the aforementioned Lombards strove for canonical rules and became helpers of priests."&lt;ref&gt;''Istius rothari regis temporibus ortum est lumen in tenebris; per quem supradicti langobardi ad cannonicam tenderunt certamina et sacerdotum facti sunt adiutores'', quoted in Everett (2003), 170 n. 30, for whom the phrase "helpers of priests" is "curiously Carolingian".&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chronicon'' diverges from Paul in calling [[Peredeo]], the assassin of the first Lombard king in Italy, [[Alboin]], a mere ''[[cubicularius]]'', a type of eunuch.&lt;ref&gt;Goffart (1988), 393 n. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unique themes==
The ''Chronicon Gothanum'' is less detailed than the ''Origo'' in its narrative of the Lombards' migration from northern Europe to Italy. It says that the Lombards were descended from serpents and describes their movements as being guided by [[Divine providence|Providence]] towards a [[Promised Land]] (Italy). It credits God with raising them from the dung through conversion and baptism to be among the "number of the good" (''numerum bonorum''). It has been suggested that the ''Chronicon'' censors the pagan aspects of Lombard history, but while its narrative is more providential, it is not circumspect about the Lombards' paganism.&lt;ref&gt;Berto (2010), 31 and n. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The author argues that the Lombards came to Italy precisely to be saved, and reminds his readers that "where there is no law, sin is not to be imputed".&lt;ref&gt;''Non inputatur peccatum, cum lex non esset'', quoted in Berto (2010), 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chronicon'' says that Alboin saw that God had predestined [[Pavia]] to be his capital, whereas Paul the Deacon has a story explaining how Pavia proved itself to be under divine protection. For all the kings of the Lombards after Alboin, the ''Chronicon'' gives only the length of reign, except for Rothari. Unlike Paul, the ''Chronicon'' does not mention that Rothari was an [[Arianism|Arian]].&lt;ref&gt;Berto (2010), 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final sections of the ''Chronicon'' are full of lavish praise for [[Charlemagne]] and Pippin, the reigning king. The author praises Pippin's conquest of the [[duchy of Benevento]], his victory over the Avars (''Abari'' or ''Beowinides'', i.e. "Bohemians") and his reconquest of Corsica in 806. In fact, Benevento was never fully subdued and Corsica was raided by the Moors again in 809 and conquered by them in 810.&lt;ref&gt;Berto (2010), 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chronicon'' portrays the first decades of Carolingian rule in Italy as a golden age of peace and prosperity, in contrast to the ''Historia'' written by [[Andreas of Bergamo]] later that century, which portrays the time as a period of misfortunes and famine.&lt;ref&gt;Berto (2010), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magali Coumert argues that the ''Chronicon'' stresses continuity between the pagan Lombards and the Carolingians by portraying both the first Lombard king, Angelmund, and Pippin as both fighting the ''Beowinides'' (Avars). The two-hundred-year pact the pagan Lombards are said to have made with the Avars while in Pannonia then paved the way for their entry into Italy, and Pippin's victory over the Avars connects the Frankish conquest to the destiny of the now-Christian Lombards&lt;ref&gt;Berto (2010), 49 n. 137, summarises Coumert's argument, but disagrees with it.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15822">The '''Chu Silk Manuscript''' ({{zh|s=楚帛书|t=楚帛書|p=Chǔ Bóshū|w=Ch'u Po-shu}}), also known as the '''Chu Silk Manuscript from Zidanku in Changsha''' ({{zh|s=长沙子弹库楚帛书|t=長沙子彈庫楚帛書|p=Chángshā Zǐdànkù Chǔ Bóshū|w= Ch'ang-sha Tzu-tan-k'u Ch'u Po-shu}}), is a Chinese astrological and astronomical text. It was discovered in a (c. 300 BCE) [[Warring States period]] tomb from the southern Chinese state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]].

==History==
The [[provenance]] of the Chu Silk Manuscript is uncertain, like many [[antiquities trade|illicit antiquities]]. Sometime between 1934 and 1942, [[grave robbery|grave robbers]] discovered it in a tomb near Zidanku (literally "bullet storehouse"), east of [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]]. Archeologists later found the original tomb and dated it to around 300 BCE.

In 1946, the art collector Cai Jixiang (蔡季襄) owned the manuscript.  John Hadley Cox then transported it to the United States. How John Hadley Cox acquired the manuscript from Cai Jixiang remains a controversy: Cai claimed that Cox had been asked to help scan the manuscript only; Cai's efforts to have the manuscript returned had persisted till the late 1970s but failed.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.sina.com.cn/s/2005-12-05/11397624814s.shtml 楚帛书在异乡哭泣]," ''[[Sina Corp|Sina]]'', 5 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://hn.rednet.cn/c/2009/03/12/1724904.htm 文物专家解密长沙子弹库楚墓 出土缯书被骗流散美国]," ''[[Rednet]]'', 12 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The philanthropist [[Arthur M. Sackler]] purchased the ancient manuscript in 1965, and it is preserved in the [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Papers related to the manuscript can be found at the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery Archives.

Recent excavations of Chu-period tombs have discovered historically comparable manuscripts written on fragile [[Bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo slips]] and [[Silk#China|silk]] – the Chinese word ''zhubo'' (竹帛 literally "bamboo and silk") means "bamboo slips and silk (for writing); ancient books". The Chu Silk Manuscript was roughly contemporaneous with the (c. 305 BCE) [[Tsinghua Bamboo Slips]] and (c. 300 BCE) [[Guodian Chu Slips]], and it preceded the (168 BCE) [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]]. Its subject matter predates the (c. 168 BCE) Han Dynasty silk ''[[Divination by Astrological and Meteorological Phenomena]]''.

==Content==
The Chu Silk Manuscript is 47&amp;nbsp;cm long and 38&amp;nbsp;cm wide, with worn edges and folds. Exposure to light has made some portions dark and unreadable, but [[infrared photography]] helped to decipher some illegible portions.

This silken document contains 926 ancient characters in three sections, each of which involves some aspect of the [[Lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] [[Chinese calendar]]. Li and Cook (1999) call them the "Year (Inner Long Text)", "Seasons (Inner Short Text)", and "Months (Surrounding Text)".

The Inner Long and Short Text are alternate blocks, respectively with thirteen lines of text upright and with eight lines inverted (cf. Greek [[Boustrophedon]]). [[Jao Tsung-I]] (Lawton 1991:178) proposes the former section is written right side up because it discusses the [[creation myth]]s of the Chu people, and the latter is upside down because it describes events when heaven is in disarray.

The Surrounding Text in the four margins pictures a color-symbolic tree in each corner plus twelve masked zoomorphic figures with short descriptions. Scholars associate the twelve pictures with the Chu gods for the months and the four trees with the mythic pillars holding up the heavens. The Inner Short Text describes [[Gong Gong]] knocking down one heavenly pillar and causing the earth to tilt. Although these twelve figures have no certain interpretation, Loewe (1978:105) reasons, "it seems likely that they may represent twelve guardian gods or holy spirits, severally invested with powers of action for each of the twelve months. Alternatively they may represent twelve shamans or intermediaries, wearing masks and capable of communicating with such deities." [[Li Xueqin]] (1987) identified these twelve gods with the ancient names for the months given in the ''[[Erya]]'' (8/15, Chu 陬, Ru 如, Bing 寎, ...). The manuscript's sides represent the four directions and seasons. In traditional Chinese terms, the [[Four Symbols (China)|Four Symbols]] are the [[Azure Dragon|Azure Dragon of the East]] (青龍), [[Vermilion Bird|Vermillion Bird of the South]] (朱雀), [[White Tiger (China)|White Tiger of the West]] (白虎), and [[Black Tortoise|Black Tortoise of the North]] (玄武). Each direction is divided into seven sectors, constituting the [[Twenty-Eight Mansions]] (二十八宿) of the [[lunar month]].

The Chu Silk Manuscript concerns [[Chinese astronomy]] and [[Chinese astrology]], describes the [[creation myth]]s of [[Fuxi]] and [[Nüwa|Nuwa]], and reveals ancient religious perspectives and [[cosmogony]]. Li and Cook (1999:172) conclude that, "Generally, the writer of the manuscript was concerned that the calendar be used with proper respect and knowledge. Otherwise, the text threatens, cosmic collapse and evil catastrophic events would occur." Li and Cook identify the design with the ''shitu'' (式圖 "cosmic model diagram").
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Chu Silk Manuscript consists of both illustrations and texts; it is designed to resemble a divination board (''shi''; also sometimes called a diviner's board or cosmograph), which is itself a model of the cosmos. This type of instrument, of which several have been found in Han tombs, consists of a round board symbolizing heaven that can rotate on a pivot on top of a square board representing the earth. (1999:172) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This ''shi'' (式, literally "model; standard; form; pattern") or ''shipan'' (式盤) was the precursor for the ''[[luopan]]'' (羅盤) or "[[feng shui]] compass".

==Translations==
Interpreting the Chu Silk Manuscript's brush-written [[Chinese characters]] is especially difficult. Some of these ancient [[logogram]]s are illegible and some are missing in [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacuna]]. Others are what Barnard (1981:181) calls "descendantless graphs" unidentified with standard characters, which "may reflect something of the Ch'u (written) "dialect" rather than more general characteristics of pre-Han character structures."

Barnard (1973) provided the first English translation of the manuscript, followed by Li and Cook (1999). To illustrate the subject matter, the translated beginning of each section is quoted below. Note that the ellipsis "[...]" marks obliterated or untranslatable characters.

"Year (Inner Long Text)" has three subsections; warning about unnatural events if the months are improperly calibrated, stressing the importance of a proper calendar for an auspicious year from the gods, and cautioning people to respectfully sacrifice to the gods.
{{quote|If [...] and the length of the lunar months becomes too long or too short, then they will not fit the proper degree and spring, summer, autumn, and winter will [not] be [...] regular; the sun, moon, and planets will erratically overstep their paths. When (the months) are too long, too short, contrary, or chaotic, (the growth of) the grasses and trees have no regularity. This is [called] ''yao'', "demonic" (influences or omens). When heaven and earth create calamities, the Heaven's Cudgel (''Tianpou'') star creates (sweeping) destruction, sending (the destruction) down through all four regions (of the earth). Mountains collapse, springs gush forth geysers. This is called "contravention." If you contravene the years (and) the months, then upon entering the seventh or eighth day of the month there will be fog, frost, and clouds of dust, and you will not be able to function according (to heaven's plan). (tr. Li and Cook 1999:174)}}

"Seasons (Inner Short Text)" also has three subsections; describing how the gods separated heaven and earth and determined the four seasons, [[Yan Emperor|Yandi]] and [[Zhu Rong]] supported the heavens with five pillars of different colors, and [[Gong Gong]] divided time into periods, days, months, and years.
{{quote|Long, long ago, Bao Xi of [...] came from [...] and lived in [...]. His [...] was [...] and [...] woman. It was confusing and dark, without [...], [...] water [...] wind and rain were thus obstructed. He then married Zuwei [...]'s granddaughter, named Nü Tian. She gave birth to four [... (children)] who then helped put things in motion making the transformations arrive according (to Heaven's plan). Relinquishing (this) duty, they then rested and acted (in turn) controlling the sidewalls (of the calendrical plan); they helped calculate time by steps. The separated (heaven) above and (earth) below. Since the mountains were out of order, they then named the mountains, rivers, and [[Four Seas]]. They arranged (themselves) by [...] hot and cold ''qi''. In order to cross mountains, rivers and streams (of various types) when there was as yet no sun or moon (for a guide), when the people traveled across mountains and rivers, the four gods stepped in succession to indicate the year; these are the four seasons. (tr. Li and Cook 1999:174)}}
This "stepped" refers to ritual ''[[Yubu]]'' (禹步 "Steps of [[Yu the Great|Yu]]", later known as ''[[bugang]]'' 步罡 "walking the guideline", Andersen 1989). Yu was the legendary founder of the [[Xia dynasty]] who controlled the [[Chinese mythology#Great Flood|Great Flood]]'s waters and regulated the four seasons.

"Months (Surrounding Text)" in the margins has twelve subsections that picture the monthly gods and list their calendrical rules. 
{{quote|[The first month is called] Qu. (During this month) Yi will come. Do not [...] kill (living beings). ''Renzi'' and ''bingzi'' are inauspicious (days). If you make [...] and attack to the north, the general will come to evil, [...]. [The month's complete title is] Quyuxia, "Pick from Below".&lt;br /&gt;
[The second month is called] Ru. (During this month) you can send out an army and build a city, but you cannot marry off a daughter or take in slaves. Don't regret if you cannot accomplish both. [The month's complete title is] Ruciwu, "Such is Military." &lt;br /&gt;
[The third month is called Bing.] (During this month) [...] marry, raise domestic animals, [...]. [The month's complete title is] Bingsichun, "Bing Controls Spring." (tr. Li and Cook 1999:175) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this context, "Yi" (夷) refers to [[Dongyi]] "eastern barbarians", while ''renzi'' (壬子) and ''bingzi'' (丙子) are names in the [[sexagenary cycle]] based on ten [[Celestial stem|Heavenly Stems]] and twelve [[Earthly Branches]] (see the [[Chinese calendar correspondence table]]).}}

==Textual genre==
Several [[Chinese classics]] are comparable with the Chu Silk Manuscript. For instance, Major (1999:125) says it "anticipates later ritual and astrological calendars, such as the "Yueling" [月令 "Monthly Commands"] of the ''Lüshi chunqiu'', in emphasizing the importance of performing certain actions and refraining from others in each month of the year in order to ensure safety and good fortune for the community as a whole."

In addition, Jao (1985, Lawton 1991:176) compares the manuscript with both the ''Tianguan shu'' (天官書 "Essay on Astronomy") in the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' and the bamboo ''Rishu'' (日書 "Almanacs") from the Chu burials at [[Yunmeng County|Yunmeng]] and the Qin burials at [[Tianshui]].

Within traditional terms for Chinese schools of thought, [[Ling Li (writer)|Li Ling]] (1985, Lawton 1991:179) classifies the manuscript as the oldest example of ''shushu'' (數術 "numerals and skills"). "''Shushu'' not only includes astronomy and the calendrical and mathematical sciences, but also the various related areas in divination (based on deduction) and physiognomy (based on observation)." ''Shushu'' contrasted with ''fangji'' (方技 "prescriptions and techniques"), which included [[Traditional Chinese medicine]], [[neidan]], [[Tao yin|Dao yin]], etc., and both specialties were associated with ''[[fangshi]]'' "diviners; magicians". "''Shushu'' is primarily related to the universal order (hence, the cosmos), while ''fangji'' is primarily related to the human order (hence, the human body)." Li concludes the Chu Silk Manuscript's cosmic model was based on ''liuren'' (六壬) or ''[[Da Liu Ren]]'' (大六壬) calendrical astrology.

The '''Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society''', founded in 1866, is a [[English local history|local historical]], [[antiquarian]], [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[text publication society]] and [[registered charity]] covering the modern county of [[Cumbria]].

==Aims==
The society exists to "promote, encourage, foster" the combined studies of [[genealogy]], history, [[Tradition|custom]] and [[archaeology]], within the boundaries of the [[non-metropolitan county]] of [[Cumbria]] (which, as well as the two titular [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]] of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]], includes elements of historic [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cumbriapast.com/ms/pdf/Society_constitution_Apr_16.pdf |title= Revised Rules, 2008 and 2012 |publisher=Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society |accessdate=21 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The society was established in [[Penrith, Cumbria]] on 11 September 1866, with "five business and professional men from both counties" as founder-members.&lt;ref name=Gazette&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Thomas |url=http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/news/14259669.NOSTALGIA__Society_aimed_to_preserve_the_antiquities_of_two_counties/?ref=mac |title=Nostalgia: Society aimed to preserve the antiquities of two counties |newspaper=[[The Westmorland Gazette]] |date=7 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The then [[Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale|Earl of Lonsdale]] was appointed honorary president. One of the society's first official acts was to campaign for the protection of the [[Dunmail Raise]] [[cairn]], and to organise an [[archaeological dig]] on the [[Borrowdale|Low Borrow Bridge]] [[Roman fort]], near [[Tebay]]. Membership rose to 115 by 1866 (with around a quarter being clergymen), and "includ[ed] three ladies".&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt; The society returned to the Low Borrow Bridge site, by then a [[scheduled monument]], in 2011 and discovered further evidence as to the size of the camp,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-14362255 |title=Archaeologists excavate Roman fort near Tebay |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=9 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2015 it was a joint funder of work into a [[dendrochronological]] [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dating]] on [[Kendal]]'s fourteenth-century [[The Castle Dairy|Castle dairy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Carl |last=Fallowfield |url=http://www.cumbriacrack.com/2015/04/29/fascinating-finds-shed-light-on-history-of-ancient-dairy/ |title=Fascinating finds shed light on history of ancient dairy |website=Cumbria Crack |date=29 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
A publishing arm was created in 1877,&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt; and by 2015 was responsible for publishing its [[peer-review]]ed journal ''The Transactions'' of the society, a triannual [[newsletter]], and various dedicated book series for specific areas of interest (for example, the Extra Series, and those for Records, Research, and Tracts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cumbriapast.com/cgi-bin/ms/main.pl?action=editorial |title=Publications Committee |website=Cumbria Past |publisher=Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society |accessdate=21 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Daiji'''''| 大治}} was a {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]|年号,|''nengō'',|lit. "year name"}} after ''[[Tenji (era)|Tenji]]'' and before ''[[Tenshō (Heian period)|Tenshō]].''  This period spanned the years from January 1126 through January 1131.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Daiji''" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 139|page=139}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File].&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning emperor was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Sutoku of Japan|Sutoku]]''-tennō''|崇徳天皇}}.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA181,M1  ''Annales des emepereurs du japon'', pp. 181]-185; Brown, Delmer ''et al.'' (1979).

==Change of era==
* '''January 25, 1126''' {{nihongo|''Daiji gannen''|大治元年}}&lt;!-- NengoCalc 大治一年一月一日 --&gt;: The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events.

==Events of the ''Daiji'' era==
* '''1128''' (''Daiji 3, in the 3rd month''): Taiken-mon In ordered the construction of [[Enshō-ji (Antei)|Enshō-ji]] in fulfillment of a sacred vow.&lt;ref name="t185"&gt;Titsigh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA185,M1  p. 185.]&lt;/ref&gt; This was one in a series of "sacred vow temples" (''gogan-ji'') built by imperial command following a precedent established by [[Emperor Shirakawa]], who established and developed the [[Hosshō-ji]] complex.&lt;ref&gt;Varley, p. 200; the six ''gogan-ji'' ("superiority" temples) were: 1. [[Hosshō-ji]] (Superiority of Buddhist Law); 2. [[Sonshō-ji]] (Superiority of Worship); 3. [[Saishō-ji]] (Most Superior); 4. [[Enshō-ji (Antei)|Enshō-ji]] (Superiority of Perfection); 5. [[Jōshō-ji]] (Superirority of Becoming); 6. [[Enshō-ji (Kenchō)|Enshō-ji]] (Superiority of Duration).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1128''' (''Daiji 3, 6th month''): Fujiwara Tadamichi is relieved of his responsibilities and duties as ''[[sesshō]]'' (regent); and simultaneously, Tadamichi is named ''[[kampaku]].''&lt;ref name="t185"/&gt;
* '''July 24, 1129''' (''Daiji 4, 7th day of the 7th month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 大治四年七月七日 --&gt;: The former-Emperor Shirakawa died at the age of 77.&lt;ref name="b323" /&gt;

Her mother was never executed, partly due to a campaign on her behalf conducted by [[Simone de Beauvoir]]; her stepfather was also freed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IfPxfEQpW38C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=%22abdelkader+guerroudj%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Bj0FEK_45u&amp;sig=BlIC1GY2QH76LJpzMX75VjU0vuY&amp;hl=en|title=Uncivil War: Intellectuals and Identity Politics During the Decolonization|isbn=0-8122-3588-6|year=2001|author=[[James D. Le Sueur]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danièle Minne joined the struggle when she was 17, going underground under the nom de guerre of ''Djamila''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.chris-kutschera.com/A/algeria_women.htm|title=What happened to Algeria's Fighting Women?|author=[[Chris Kutschera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minne was considered a women combatant in the Algerian War known as a fidayat. She "planted at least two bombs during the Battle of Algeris, and joined the maquis in wilaya 3 in 1957".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seferdjeli|first=Ryme|title=RETHINKING THE HISTORY OF THEMUJAHIDATDURING THE ALGERIAN WAR|url=https://www-tandfonline-com-s.acces-distant.sciences-po.fr/doi/pdf/10.1080/1369801X.2012.687902?needAccess=true|journal=Interventions|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=238–255|doi=10.1080/1369801x.2012.687902}}&lt;/ref&gt; A historian, Alistair Horne, described one of Minne's missions:   &lt;blockquote&gt;"The targets were the Otomatic, a favourite students's bar on the Rue Michelet; the Cafeteria opposite (second time over) and the Coq-Hardi, a popular brasserie…placed in the ladies' lavatory, Daniéle Minne's bomb in the Otomatic seriously injured a young girl and several others".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mortimer|first=Mildred|date=2012|title=Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièle Djamila Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar|jstor=10.2979/reseafrilite.43.1.101|journal=Research in African Literatures|volume=43|pages=101–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Arrested and jailed in December 1956, she was sentenced, on 4 December 1957, to 7 years in prison by a juvenile tribunal.

Freed after independence in 1962, she wrote a PhD dissertation on the participation of Algerian women in the war, based on interviews with eighty-eight women between 1978 and 1986; the dissertation was later published as a book, ''Des femmes dans la guerre d’Algérie'' (Karthala, Paris). The book was the basis for the film ''Algeria: Women at War'' by [[Parminder Vir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200207080031|title=The mother of all battles|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=2002-07-08|author=[[Parminder Vir]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danièle Minne became '''Djamila Amrane''' by marriage in 1964. She later worked at the [[University of Algiers]] but, by 1999, was a professor of history and feminist studies at the [[University of Toulouse]].

== ''Des femmes dans la guerre d'Algérie'' ==
Amrane's ''Des femmes dans la guerre d'Algérie'', "remains the major historical study on women's participation in the Algerian War"&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; and identifies not only why women were involved in the war, but the various roles of women combatants and their contributions to the FLN. Her research is based mainly on interviews with former FLN women activists&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; and consists of "eighty-eight interviews Algerian women combatants".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a militant herself, Minne "was in a privileged position to conduct person interviews that probe the intimate experiences of militant women".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, it is also clear that as a former militant her work has been "influenced by her reconstruction and understanding of her own role during the war".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Minne limits herself as a historian by making it clear through her cited testimony that women had indeed been tortured but chose to leave much unsaid in this regard. The rationale behind this was, "given the trauma inflicted upon torture victims, she did not feel that she could interview her subjects about their ordeal. In her view, their silence proved their wish to forget a traumatic episode".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this sense, Minne's ''Des femmes dans la guerra d'Algérie'' "breaks the silence surrounding women's participation in the war, yet contributes to the silence concerning torture and its psychological consequences"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that would last for decades after Algeria's independence. It would not be until a decade later that the memoir of [[Louisette Ighilahriz|Louisette Ighilariz]] would come to light, thus revealing in more detail the nature of torture during the Algerian War.

Amrane also completed important research on the estimate of women who had participated in the Algerian War by using the register of the Ministry of Mujahidin.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; She concluded that "there were 10,949 FLN-ALN female activists; 3.10 percent of the total number of FLN-ALN members".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

{{EarlyBuddhism}}
The '''early Buddhist schools''' are those schools into which the Buddhist [[monasticism|monastic]] [[Sangha (Buddhism)|saṅgha]] initially split, due originally to differences in [[vinaya]] and later also due to doctrinal differences and geographical separation of groups of monks.

The original saṅgha split into the first early schools (generally believed to be the [[Sthavira nikāya]] and the [[Mahāsāṃghika]]) a significant number of years after the passing away of [[Gautama Buddha]]. According to scholar Collett Cox "most scholars would agree that even though the roots of the earliest recognized groups predate [[Ashoka|Aśoka]], their actual separation did not occur until after his death."&lt;ref&gt;''Disputed Dharmas: Early Buddhist Theories on Existence''. by Collett Cox. The Institute for Buddhist Studies. Tokyo: 1995. {{ISBN|4-906267-36-X}} pg 23&lt;/ref&gt; Later, these first early schools split into further divisions such as the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivādin]]s and the [[Dharmaguptaka]]s, and ended up numbering, traditionally, about 18 or 20 schools. In fact, there are several overlapping lists of 18 schools preserved in the Buddhist tradition, totaling about twice as many, though some may be alternative names. It is thought likely that the number is merely conventional.

The textual material shared by the early schools is often termed the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] and these are an important source for understanding their doctrinal similarities and differences. 

== Developments in history ==

=== The first council ===
{{Main article|First Buddhist council}}
According to the scriptures (''[[Khandhaka|Cullavagga]]'' XI.1 ff), three months after the passing of [[Gautama Buddha]], the first council was held at Rajagaha by some of his disciples who had attained [[arhat|arahantship]]. At this point, [[Theravada|Theravāda]] tradition maintains that no conflict about what the Buddha taught occurred; the teachings were divided into various parts and each was assigned to an elder and his pupils to commit to memory.

The accounts of the council in the scriptures of the schools differ as to what was actually recited there. Purāṇa is recorded as having said: "Your reverences, well chanted by the elders are the [[Dharma|Dhamma]] and [[Vinaya]], but in that way that I heard it in the Lord's presence, that I received it in his presence, in that same way will I bear it in mind." [''Vinaya-pitaka'': ''Cullavagga'' XI:1:11].

Some scholars deny that the first council actually took place.&lt;ref&gt;Hoiberg, Dale; Indu Ramchandani. "Early Buddhist schools" entry in ''Students' Britannica India'', p. 264. Popular Prakashan, 2000. {{ISBN|0-85229-760-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism'', Routledge, 1989, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The second council ===
{{Main article|Second Buddhist council}}
The '''Second Buddhist council''' took place approximately one hundred years after Gautama Buddha's [[parinirvana|parinirvāṇa]]. Virtually all scholars agree that the second council was a historical event.&lt;ref&gt;"Buddhist council." Encyclopædia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditions regarding the Second Council are confusing and ambiguous, but it is agreed that the overall result was the first schism in the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]], between the Sthavira nikāya and the Mahāsāṃghikas, although it is not agreed upon by all what the cause of this split was.&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew. ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' 2004. p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Period between the second and third councils ===
The textual sources agree that the first split was between the Sthaviravāda and the Mahāsāṃghika. However, after this initial division, more were to follow. Some modern scholars argue that the first split occurred in the intervening period between the second and third councils, and was probably about [[vinaya|monastic discipline]]. However, only two ancient sources (the Dīpavaṃsa and Bhavya's third list) place the first schism before Aśoka, and none attribute the schism to a dispute on Vinaya practice.

=== Third council under Aśoka ===
{{Main article|Third Buddhist council}}

Tradition largely holds that Buddhism split into 18 schools, but different sources give different lists of them, and scholars conclude that the number is merely conventional.

Theravādin sources state that, in the 3rd century BCE, a third council was convened under the patronage of Aśoka, but no mention of this council is found in other sources.&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism''&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue that there are certain implausible features of the Theravādin account which imply that the third council was ahistorical. The remainder consider it a purely Theravāda-[[Vibhajyavāda|Vibhajjavāda]] council. It is generally accepted, however, that one or several disputes did occur during Aśoka's reign, involving both doctrinal and disciplinary (''vinaya'') matters, although these may have been too informal to be called a "council". The Sthavira school had, by the time of Aśoka, divided into three sub-schools, doctrinally speaking, but these did not become separate monastic orders until later.

According to the Theravādin account, this council was convened primarily for the purpose of establishing an official orthodoxy. At the council, small groups raised questions about the specifics of the ''vinaya'' and the interpretation of doctrine. The chairman of the council, Moggaliputta Tissa, compiled a book, the ''[[Kathavatthu]]'', which was meant to refute these arguments. The council sided with Moggaliputta and his version of Buddhism as orthodox; it was then adopted by Emperor Aśoka as his empire's official religion. In [[Pali]], this school of thought was termed Vibhajjavāda, literally "thesis of [those who make] a distinction".

The distinction involved was as to the existence of phenomena (''dhamma''s) in the past, future and present. The version of the scriptures that had been established at the third council, including the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka|Vinaya]]'', ''[[Sutta Pitaka|Sutta]]'' and the ''[[Abhidhamma Pitaka]]''s (collectively known as the "[[Tripiṭaka]]"), was taken to [[Sri Lanka]] by Emperor Aśoka's son, the Venerable [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]].  There it was eventually committed to writing in the [[Pali]] language. The [[Pāli Canon]] remains the most complete set of surviving ''[[Nikāya]]'' scriptures, although the greater part of the Sarvāstivādin canon also survives in Chinese translation, some parts exist in Tibetan translations, and some fragments exist in Sanskrit manuscripts, while parts of various canons (sometimes unidentified), exist in Chinese and fragments in other Indian dialects.

=== Developments during and after the third council ===
Whatever might be the truth behind the Theravādin account, it was around the time of Aśoka that further divisions began to occur within the Buddhist movement and a number of additional schools emerged, including the [[Sarvāstivāda]] and the [[Saṃmitīya]]. All of these early schools of Nikāya Buddhism eventually came to be known collectively as "the eighteen schools" in later sources.   Unfortunately, with the exception of the Theravāda, none of these early schools survived beyond the late medieval period by which time several were already long extinct, although a considerable amount of the canonical literature of some of these schools has survived, mainly in Chinese translation. Moreover, the origins of specifically [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] doctrines may be discerned in the teachings of some of these early schools, in particular in the Mahāsānghika and the Sarvāstivāda.

During and after the third council, elements of the Sthavira group called themselves Vibhajjavādins. One part of this group was transmitted to Sri Lanka and to certain areas of southern India, such as Vanavasi in the south-west and the Kañci region in the south-east. This group later ceased to refer to themselves specifically as "Vibhajjavādins", but reverted to calling themselves "Theriyas", after the earlier Theras (Sthaviras).  Still later, at some point prior to the [[Dipavamsa]] (4th century), the Pali name Theravāda was adopted and has remained in use ever since for this group.

The [[Pudgalavādin]]s were also known as Vatsiputrīyas after their putative founder. Later this group became known as the Sammitīya school after one of its subdivisions. It died out around the 9th or 10th century CE.  Nevertheless, during most of the early medieval period, the Sammitīya school was numerically the largest Buddhist group in India, with more followers than all the other schools combined.  The Sarvāstivādin school was most prominent in the north-west of India and provided some of the doctrines that would later be adopted by the Mahāyāna. Another group linked to Sarvāstivāda was the Sautrāntika school, which only recognized the authority of the sutras and rejected the abhidharma transmitted and taught by the Vaibhāṣika wing of Sarvāstivāda.  Based on textual considerations, it has been suggested that the Sautrāntikas were actually adherents of Mūlasarvāstivāda. The relation between Sarvāstivāda and  the [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]], however, is unclear.

[[Etienne Lamotte]] divided the mainstream Buddhist schools into three main doctrinal types:&lt;ref&gt;Shi huifeng: “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation?&lt;/ref&gt;

#The “personalists”, such as the [[Pudgalavādin]] Vātsīputrīyas and Saṃmittīyas
#The “[[Philosophical realism|realists]]”, namely the [[Theravāda]] and [[Sarvāstivāda]] [[Abhidharma|Ābhidharmikas]]
#The “[[nominalism|nominalists]]”, for instance, the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] Prajñaptivādins, and possibly non-Abhidharma [[Sthaviravadins]].

Between the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE, the terms "Mahāyāna" and "Hīnayāna" were first used in writing, in, for example, the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]''.

=== Mahāyāna members ===
Although the various early schools of Buddhism are sometimes loosely classified as "[[Hinayana|Hīnayāna]]" in modern times, this is not necessarily accurate. According to Jan Nattier, Mahāyāna never referred to a separate sect of Buddhism (Skt. ''nikāya''), but rather to the set of ideals and doctrines for bodhisattvas.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate [[vinaya]] or ordination lineage from the early Buddhist schools, and therefore each [[bhikkhu|bhikṣu]] or [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇī]] adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school.

Membership in these ''nikāyas'', or monastic sects, continues today with the [[Dharmaguptaka]] nikāya in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda nikāya in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Therefore, Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'': pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Harrison clarifies that while Mahāyāna monastics belonged to a nikāya, not all members of a nikāya were Mahāyānists.&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2000) ''Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition'': p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Isabella Onians notes that Mahāyāna works rarely used the term ''Hīnayāna'', typically using the term ''Śrāvakayāna'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Onians, "Tantric Buddhist Apologetics, or Antinomianism as a Norm," D.Phil. dissertation, Oxford, Trinity Term 2001 pg 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese Buddhist monk and pilgrim [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]] wrote about relationship between the various "vehicles" and the early Buddhist schools in India. He wrote, "There exist in the West numerous subdivisions of the schools which have different origins, but there are only four principal schools of continuous tradition." These schools are namely the Mahāsāṃghika nikāya, Sthavira, Mūlasarvāstivāda and Saṃmitīya nikāyas.&lt;ref&gt;Walser, Joseph (2005) ''Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture'': pp. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining their doctrinal affiliations, he then writes, "Which of the four schools should be grouped with the Mahāyāna or with the Hīnayāna is not determined." That is to say, there was no simple correspondence between a Buddhist monastic sect, and whether its members learn "Hīnayāna" or "Mahāyāna" teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Walser, Joseph (2005) ''Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture'': pp. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Chinese pilgrims ===
During the [[first millennium]], monks from China such as [[Faxian]], [[Xuanzang]], and Yijing made pilgrimages to India and wrote accounts of their travels when they returned home. These Chinese travel records constitute extremely valuable sources of information concerning the state of Buddhism in India during the early medieval period.

By the time the Chinese pilgrims Xuanzang and Yijing visited India, there were five early Buddhist schools that they mentioned far more frequently than others. They commented that the Sarvāstivāda/Mūlasarvāstivāda, Mahāsāṃghika, and Saṃmitīya were the principal early Buddhist schools still extant in India, along with the Sthavira sect.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Buddhism''. edited by Edward Irons. Facts on File: 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-5459-6}} pg 419&lt;/ref&gt; The Dharmaguptakas continued to be found in [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]] and Central Asia, along the Silk Road.

== The eighteen schools ==
It is commonly said that there were eighteen schools of Buddhism in this period. What this actually means is more subtle. First, although the word "school" is used, there was not yet an institutional split in the ''saṅgha''. The Chinese traveler [[Xuanzang]] observed even when the Mahāyāna were beginning to emerge from this era that monks of different schools would live side by side in dormitories and attend the same lectures. Only the books that they read were different.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Cook. ''Light of Liberation: A History of Buddhism in India''. Dharma Publishing, 1992. p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, no historical sources can agree what the names of these "eighteen schools" were. The origin of this saying is therefore unclear.

What follows are the lists given by each of the different sources.

=== According to the ''Dipavamsa'' ===
This list was taken from the Sri Lankan chronicles, ''[[Dipavamsa]]'' (3rd-4th century CE) and ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' (5th century CE).

Noted Canadian Buddhist scholar [[A.K. Warder]] (University of Toronto) identifies the following eighteen early Buddhist schools (in approximate chronological order): [[Sthaviravada]], [[Mahasamghika]], [[Vatsiputriya]], [[Ekavyavaharika]], Gokulika (a.k.a. [[Kukkutika]], etc.), [[Sarvastivada]], [[Lokottaravada]], Dharmottariya, Bhadrayaniya, [[Sammitiya]], Sannagarika, [[Bahusrutiya]], [[Prajnaptivada]], [[Mahisasaka]], Haimavata (a.k.a. [[Kasyapiya]]), [[Dharmaguptaka]], [[Caitika]], and the Apara and Uttara (Purva) Saila. Warder says that these were the early Buddhist schools as of circa 50 BCE, about the same time that the Pali Canon was first committed to writing and the presumptive origin date of the Theravada sect, though the term 'Theravada' was not used before the fourth century CE (see Ajahn Sucitto, [http://ajahnsucitto.org/articles/what-is-theravada-2012/ "What Is Theravada"] (2012); see also A.K. Warder, ''Indian Buddhism,'' 3rd rev. ed. (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 2000), chapters 8 and 9).

== Legacy ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
The [[Theravada|Theravāda]] School of [[Sri Lanka]], [[Burma]], and [[Thailand]] is descended from the Sthaviravādin and (more specifically) the [[Vibhajjavada|Vibhajjavāda]] School.  It underwent two more changes of name.  In the Indian accounts it is sometimes called the "Tāmraparnīya" (translation: Sri Lankan lineage), but there is no indication that this referred to any change in doctrine or scripture, while it is very obvious that it refers to geographical location.  At some point prior to the ''Dipavamsa'' (4th century) the name was changed to "Theravāda", probably to reemphasize the relationship to the original "[[Sthaviravada|Sthaviravāda]]", which is the [[Sanskrit]] version of the Pāli term "Theravāda".

The Theravāda school is the only remaining school which is exclusively aligned with the philosophic outlook of the early schools.  However, significant variation is found between the various Theravādin communities, usually concerning the strictness of practice of ''vinaya'' and the attitude one has towards ''abhidhamma''.  Both of these, however, are aspects of the Vibhajjavādin recension of the ''Tipiṭaka'', and the variation between current Theravāda groups is mainly a reflection of accent or emphasis, not content of the ''Tipiṭaka'' or the commentaries.  The ''Tipiṭaka'' of the Theravāda and the main body of its commentaries are believed to come from (or be heavily influenced by) the [[Sthaviravadins|Sthaviravādins]] and especially the subsequent [[Vibhajjavadins|Vibhajjavādins]].

{{Buddhist traditions timeline}}

The legacies of other early schools are preserved in various Mahāyāna traditions.  All of the schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] use a [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]] ''[[vinaya]]'' and study the Sarvāstivādin ''[[abhidharma]]'', supplemented with Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna texts. [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese schools]] use the ''vinaya'' from the [[Dharmagupta]] school, and have versions of those of other schools also. Fragments of the canon of texts from these schools also survive such as the ''[[Mahavastu|Mahāvastu]]'' of the [[Mahāsānghika]] School.

Discussion on the difference in their views includes Kathāvatthu and the Chinese or Tibetan translation of Samayabhedoparacanacakra ({{zh|labels=no|異部宗輪論}}), [[Mahavibhasa|Abhidharmamahāvibhāsā-śāstra]] ({{zh|labels=no|大毘婆沙論}}), [[Abhidharmakośakārikā|Abhidharmakośa-śāstra]] ({{zh|labels=no|俱舍論}}) [[Abhidharma#Sastras|Abhidharma-nyāyānusāra]] ({{zh|labels=no|順正理論}}), [[Abhidharma#Sastras|Abhidharma-kośa-samaya-pradīpikā]] ({{zh|labels=no|顯宗論}}) etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chibs.edu.tw/publication/LunCong/024/307-351.htm 六、《論事》(Kathāvatthu)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Editions Victor Gadoury''' is a [[Monaco]] publishing company specialized in [[numismatics]] and selling [[coin catalog]]s.

==History==
The Editions Victor Gadoury was founded in [[Baden-Baden]] in 1972. Victor Gadoury was a member of a division within the [[Canadian Army]] that was stationed in Germany. After his discharge he decided to remain in Germany and become a numismatic.

In 1973 Victor Gadoury founded the publishing house Editions Victor Gadoury where he published the first edition of ''Monnaies Françaises'' in 1973, gathering knowledge on all French coins from 1789 until the present. Since then, the book has been published every two years; ''Monnaies Françaises'' 2009 was its 19th edition.{{update after|2009|12|31}}

In 1978 Victor Gadoury moved his publishing house Editions Victor Gadoury to the Principality of [[Monaco]], at the end of the Boulevard d'Italie, moving next to the Boulevard de Moulins before returning to the Boulevard d'Italie.

In 1994, the publishing house Editions Victor Gadoury was acquired by two Italian numismatics, Vescovi and Pastrone, and since November 2001 Editions Victor Gadoury has been managed solely by Francesco Pastrone in Monaco.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6019">[[File:Barbarossa.jpg|thumb|upright|Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] (1122–1190) as a crusader. Dedicatory image (c. 1188) in a manuscript of the ''Historia Hierosolymitana'' (Vat. Lat. 2001).]]
'''''Historia Hierosolymitana''''' is a chronicle of the [[First Crusade]]  by one '''Robert the Monk''' (''Robertus Monachus''), written between c. 1107&amp;ndash;1120.&lt;ref name=date&gt;The text is dated to 1107 by Starck (2012) but somewhat later, to  ca. 1116&amp;ndash;1122, by [[Steven Runciman]] , ''The First Crusade'' (A History of the Crusades, Volume 1)  Cambridge University Press (1951), Appendix I.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Robert has been identified with a prior of [[Senuc]] and former abbot of [[Abbey of Saint-Remi|Saint-Remi]], who lived c. 1055 &amp;ndash; 1122; hence he is also referred to as ''Robert of Reims'' or ''Robert of Saint-Remi'' (''Robertus Remensis'').
Robert asserts in his prologue that he had been present at the [[Council of Clermont]] of 1095, which makes his account of [[Pope Urban II]]'s speech that of an eye-witness, even though written from memory, twelve or more years later.&lt;ref name=date/&gt; 
Outside of this part, however, the author proposes not to write about his own observations but as a chronicler, having agree to rewrite, at the request of his abbot, the ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'', an account written by a soldier of [[Bohemond I of Antioch]], in a less "rustic" style.

Robert's chronicle contains an account of [[Pope Urban II]]'s speech at the [[Council of Clermont]] of November 1095, the call to arms for the [[First Crusade]]. This speech is also recorded by another eye-witness, [[Fulcher of Chartres]], and most historians tend to consider Fulcher's version as closer to the original speech, while Robert's version is seen as embellished and more "dramatic", and in parts informed by the later success of the First Crusade.
Both Robert's and Fulcher's account of the speech include a description of the terrible plight of the Christians in the East under the recent conquests of the Turks and the promise of remission of sins for those who go to their aid. Robert's version, however, includes a more vivid description of the atrocities committed by the conquerors, describing the [[desecration]] of churches, the [[forced circumcision]], [[Beheading in Islam|beheading]] and torture by [[disemboweling]] of Christian men and alluding to grievous [[war rape|rape]] of Christian women.&lt;ref&gt;"it [the race of the Turks] has led away a part of the captives into its own country, and a part it has destroyed by cruel tortures; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites of its own religion. They destroy the altars, after having defiled them with their uncleanness. They circumcise the Christians, and the blood of the circumcision they either spread upon the altars or pour into the vases of the baptismal font. When they wish to torture people by a base death, they perforate their navels, and dragging forth the extremity of the intestines, bind it to a stake; then with flogging they lead the victim around until the viscera having gushed forth the victim falls prostrate upon the ground. Others they bind to a post and pierce with arrows. Others they compel to extend their necks and then, attacking them with naked swords, attempt to cut through the neck with a single blow. What shall I say of the abominable rape of the women? To speak of it is worse than to be silent."
{{cite book|last1=Madden|first1=Thomas|title=The Concise History of the Crusades|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442215740|pages=264|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=qz0fAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Robert, Urban addressed his call explicitly to the race of the [[Franks]], of which he was himself a member, invoking the valour of their ancestors, "the glory and greatness of king [[Charlemagne|Charles the Great]], and of his son [[Louis the Pious|Louis]]", culminating in  "Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valour of your progenitors."&lt;ref&gt;''O fortissimi milites et invictorum propago parentum, nolite degenerari, sed virtutis priorum vestrorum reminiscimini.'' Le Bas (1866), [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k51573t/f799.image.r=.langEN p. 728].&lt;/ref&gt;
Robert's version also describes the spontaneous reaction of Urban's audience, bursting into cries of ''[[Deus vult]]'' ("God wills it");&lt;ref&gt; Le Bas (1866), [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k51573t/f800.image.r=.langEN p. 729].&lt;/ref&gt; this motto and battle cry is also found in the ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'', there in the more "vulgar" or vernacular form of ''Deus le volt''.
In a further element not found in Fulcher's account, and perhaps inspired after the fact by the failure of the [[People's Crusade]], Urban warns
that the expedition is not commanded or advised for the old or feeble, those unfit for bearing arms, or for women, but for experienced soldiers, that clergy should only take part with the consent of their bishop and laymen only with the blessing of their priest.

[[Speyer]] in [[Germany]] was the hometown of one of the most important Jewish communities in Middle Ages in northern Europe. Bishop Hutzmann and Salic emperor Henry IV encouraged Jewish refugees from [[Mainz]] to the foundation of a Jewish community by facilitating them.(see:[[History of the Jews in Speyer]])

This community existed until the beginning of the 16th century. The exact time and circumstances of the destruction are unknown.

The '''Jewish courtyard''' was the central area of the Jewish quarter in Speyer and consisted of the [[synagogue]]s for men and women as well as the [[Mikvah]], for ritual washing.

[[Image:Mikvah Speyer 5.jpg|thumb|left|150px|View downstairs]]

The first documented mention of this Mikvah was in 1126 and its subterranean components have been nearly unmodified for centuries.

[[File:J. Collingwood Bruce 1805-1892.jpg|thumb]]
The Reverend '''John Collingwood Bruce''', [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]] (1805–1892) was an English nonconformist minister and schoolmaster, known as a historian of [[Tyneside]] and author. He co-operated with [[John Stokoe (author)|John Stokoe]] in compiling the major song collection ''[[Northumbrian Minstrelsy]]'' published in 1882&lt;ref name=AllansMisc&gt;{{cite web|title=Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside songs and readings|url=https://archive.org/stream/allansillustrat00firgoog/allansillustrat00firgoog_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside songs and readings with lives, portraits and autographs of the writers, and notes on the songs.  Revised Edition|year=1891|publisher=Thomas &amp; Gorge Allan, 18 Blackett Street, and 34 Collingwood Street, (Newcastle upon Tyne) – Sold by W. Allan, 80 Grainqer Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, B. Allan, North Shields and Walter Scott. London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
The eldest son of John Bruce of [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], he was educated at the Percy Street Academy, a well-known school in Newcastle kept by his father, and afterwards at [[Mill Hill School]], Middlesex. He entered [[Glasgow University]] in 1821, graduated M.A. in 1826, and became hon. LL.D. in 1853.

In early life, Bruce studied for the [[Presbyterian]] ministry, but never sought a call from any congregation. In 1831, he began to assist in the management of his father's school, of which he became sole proprietor in 1834, when his father died. He retired from the school, after a successful career, in 1863.{{sfn|Wroth|1901}}

== Historical interests ==

Bruce's main interest was in the history of Britain, in particular [[North East England]] and more specifically [[Roman Britain]] and [[Hadrian's Wall]]. His books used a numbering system for the structures of the Wall, and by about 1930 it had become standard, using the [[milecastle]] located to the east. Examples are T33a or Turret 26B (Brunton): (see [[Turret (Hadrian's Wall)#Numbering system and naming|Numbering system and naming]]. His interest in music was largely historical, and in editing the ''Northumbrian Minstrelsy'' he co-operated with John Stokoe .

The article [[Music of Northumbria]] credits Stokoe with copying out, in 1850, some of the tunes from John Smith's tunebook of 1750, a book now long lost, and the pair creating this comprehensive collection of old Northern Songs. The work was on behalf of, and published by, the Ancient Melodies Committee of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne]], of which Bruce was an active committee member.

Bruce gave the [[Rhind Lectures]] in 1883, on the Roman occupation of Britain.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

== Family ==
His father, also John, had been a schoolteacher for over 40 years, first in [[Alnwick]], then in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. He was an author and had written books, including a work on Geography. He died at his home in Percy Street, Newcastle on 31 October 1834 aged 60 years.

Bruce married in 1833 Charlotte, daughter of T. Gainsford of Gerrard's Cross, [[Buckinghamshire]], and had two sons and two daughters. The eldest son. Sir [[Gainsford Bruce]], became one of the judges of the [[High Court of Justice]].{{sfn|Wroth|1901}}

== Death ==
John Collingwood Bruce died on 5 April 1892; his wife Charlotte died in 1893, and their daughter Frances died aged 18 months on 17 December 1839. They are buried in the family grave in [[Jesmond Old Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Friends of Jesmond Old Cemetery|url= http://www.jesmondoldcemetery.co.uk/history_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other children include [[Gainsford Bruce|Sir Gainsford Bruce]].

'''János Jacobinus''' (1574&amp;nbsp;– 17 July 1603)&lt;ref name='Markó_109'&gt;Markó 2006, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] politician and historian of [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] origin in the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]], who served as [[Chancellor of Transylvania]] for a short time in 1603.

==Career==
[[File:Hans von Aachen - Allegory of the Turkish war- Battle of Kronstadt (Braşov).jpg|thumb|left|Battle of Brassó, where Jacobinus killed (1603)]]
He was the son of Bernát Jacobinus, a prestigious citizen of [[Kolozsvár]] (today: ''Cluj-Napoca, Romania''). After finishing studies, he became notary of his birthplace between 1592 and 1598. He participated in the [[Wallachia]]n [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Campaign of 1595]] against [[Sinan Pasha]]. He described the events in detail and reliability. He served as secretary for [[Prince of Transylvania|Princes]] [[Sigismund Báthory]], [[Andrew Báthory]] and [[Michael the Brave]] since May 1598.

In September 1600, he defected from Michael to the insurgent nobles. He became the secretary of the Transylvanian Chancellery after Sigismund Báthory retake his throne. In this capacity, he, probably, controlled the domestic policy of Transylvania around that time, when the position of Chancellor remained vacant. He joined to [[Mózes Székely]] in April 1603 who appointed him as Chancellor. Several months later, he died in the [[battle of Brassó]] (today: ''Brașov, Romania'') along with his lord against [[Radu Şerban]], [[List of rulers of Wallachia|ruler of Wallachia]].

For a short time, he was the owner of the Wolphard–Kakas House, an important [[Renaissance]] monument on the Main square of Kolozsvár. General István Csáky gave him the house for his services. However the original owner, István Kakas, a diplomat and traveler sued back that from Jacobinus.

He was one of the most influential figures in the Zagreb art scene between the two world wars.

He collaborated with director [[Branko Gavella]] in creating a series of set designs for the [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="hnk"/&gt; In 1940 he became a full professor at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Zagreb]]. He held exhibitions at home and abroad and published many articles on art history and critiques of contemporary art events. He wrote and illustrated many books, worked on designs for posters, interiors and decorative arts objects.

==Biography==
Ljubomir Tito Stjepan Babić was born in [[Jastrebarsko]] on 14 June 1890, the son of Judge Antun Babić and Milka (née Kovačić), and nephew of the author Ljubo Babić (better known as [[Ksaver Šandor Gjalski]]). The Babić family had been raised to the nobility in 1716 by Charles VI Habsburg. The Babić family seat was [[Gredice, Croatia|Gredice]] near [[Zabok]], which had been purchased by Babić's grandfather.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Following his father's work transfers, young Ljubo attended elementary school in [[Slatina, Croatia|Slatina]], [[Glina, Croatia|Glina]] and [[Jastrebarsko]]. He attended high school in [[Bjelovar]], with the final two years in the Donji Grad gymnasium in Zagreb. During that time, he attended private art school with [[Menci Clement Crnčić]] and [[Bela Čikoš Sesija]], and took classes at the School of Arts and Crafts. After completing high school in 1908, at his father's encouragement he enrolled in the [[Faculty of Law]] at Zagreb University, but soon abandoned his studies for painting.&lt;ref name="mh-zidic"/&gt;

Thanks to a scholarship from Count [[Teodor Pejačević]] Babić was able to attend the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]] where he studied painting with [[Angelo Jank]] (1910–11), and [[Franz von Stuck]] (1911–13).&lt;ref name="mh-zidic"/&gt; In Munich, he completed a course of artistic anatomy at the Medical School while also studying set design at the Künstlertheater. In 1913-14 he went on to complete his art studies in Paris, returning to his homeland at the beginning of the [[First World War]].

There he opened a "modern painting school" in his studio, but soon afterwards accepted a teaching position at the School of Arts, (now the [[Academy of Fine Arts Zagreb|Academy of Fine Arts]]) where he became a full professor in 1940, working there for 45 years until he retired in 1961.&lt;ref name="divila"/&gt; During the 1930s, he visited other schools and institutes around Europe in order to learn from their experience and improve teaching at the Zagreb academy. In 1932, he graduated in art history from the Faculty of Philosophy, [[Zagreb University]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In addition to his painting and teaching careers, Ljubo Babić was the first curator of the [[Modern Gallery, Zagreb|Modern Gallery]] in Zagreb (1919) whose inaugural exhibition featured the previously unknown works of [[Josip Račić]]. He organized exhibitions of modern French and German Art in Zagreb, and an exhibition of medieval art from Yugoslavia in Paris in 1950.&lt;ref name="hrt"/&gt; For many years he was the director of [[The Strossmayer Gallery of Old Masters]] (from 1947) responsible for organizing many important exhibitions.&lt;ref name="culturenet"/&gt;

Babić was one of the organizers of the Croatian Spring Salon (1916), the Independent group of Croatian artists (1923), the Group of Three (1929), Group of Four (1928), the group of Croatian artists (1936)  and Croatian artists (1939).&lt;ref name="hrt"/&gt;

Ljubo Babić was elected as a Member of [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in 1928, becoming a full member in 1950.&lt;ref name="divila"/&gt; He died in [[Zagreb]] on 14 May 1974.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Legacy==
Ljubo Babić was a central figure in the Croatian art scene in the period between the two world wars. His views provided a strong influence over the art of the time.&lt;ref name="culturenet"/&gt; His early work from Munich shows some poetic symbolism and art nouveau. In portraits, he soon began to depict the more psychological characteristics of his subject. From 1916, expressionistic ideas and themes appeared, and a move towards abstraction, resulting in some of his finest works. In November 1916, on the death of [[Emperor Francis Joseph]], all the streets of Zagreb were dressed in black flags. Inspired by this image, Babić, then aged 26, painted the scene from the second floor window of his studio on Ilica Street. In the foreground is a long, torn black flag and behind it are ominous clouds, and below the people passing. Black Flag (''crna zastava'') stands as one of his most memorable images.&lt;ref name="jutarnji-retrospektiva"/&gt;

Writer [[Miroslav Krleža]] said of Babić - in the years between 1916 and 1922 - that he was strongly influenced by the time and by his own ideas. A strong influence on both was the poet [[Silvije Strahimir Kranjčević]]. Babić illustrated Kranjčević's "Songs" (''Pjesme'', 1908) and many of the poet's themes entered Babić's own work. From the inspiration of the mountain Velebit as seen from Crnčić, Babić created one of his most successful series: "View from the Sky" (''Pogled s neba''), "Aerial view" (''Arielov pogled''). He would later be known as the father of modern landscape painting in Croatia.&lt;ref name="mh-zidic"/&gt;

A journey to Spain in 1920 resulted in an expressive series of paintings, including the powerful black "Fishermen" (''Ribere''). This cycle of Spanish street scenes was well received and stands as a high point of Babić's own art and Croatian painting in general.&lt;ref name="mh-zidic"/&gt;

Around 1930, Babić started a series of landscapes and people from around Croatia. He would travel south in the summer months, sketching scenes from Koločep and Pelješca, to Čiovo and Trogir (1930–1936). He was working on what he called "native expression", believing that the landscape, historical experience and folk art could reveal the characteristics of the people. Back in his studio, he created an impressive cycle of landscapes (the series Homeland, ''Rodni kraj'' 1933-1939). This series brings his art close to documentary work and Babić worked closely with [[Matica hrvatska]] on aspects of folk heritage and modern cultural and artistic issues.&lt;ref name="mh-zidic"/&gt;

Babić was one of the creators of the golden years of Zagreb theatre life in the 1920s/30s.&lt;ref name="hrt"/&gt; He made his debut as set designer in 1918, altogether creating about 180 designs (often also sketches for the costumes) for drama, comedy and operatic performances. His designs were always based on the logic of the stage events, and contributed greatly to the development of dramatic action.&lt;ref name="mh-zidic"/&gt; He was also the founder of the first artistic Puppet Theatre in Zagreb (1920),&lt;ref name="hrt"/&gt; and his set designs for the Paris Expo in 1925, earned him the Grand Prix.&lt;ref name="jutarnji-retrospektiva"/&gt;

In addition to being a creative artist and designer, Babić was also an interpreter and popularizer of art: as an art writer and critic, as a lecturer, and as a museum curator. He was the most reliable interpreter of Croatian heritage in art museums and exhibitions between 1919-1948. He also created posters and some very successful books on art (1908–1960).&lt;ref name="mh-zidic"/&gt;

Babić's literary output includes 20 books, brochures and special editions, around 400 articles in periodicals, many encyclopedia articles and several educational programs. In addition to educational and critic works, he left a number of travel and autobiographical texts. Babić's travelogue text New York "skyline" was included  in an anthology America Spectrum from one hundred forty-one works of European writers and works (Spektrum America aus Werken hunderteinundvierzig europäischer Dichter und Werken), Wien-München-Manutius Press, 1964. He was a member of several editorial boards of literary magazines, and editor of the Academy bulletin 1957.&lt;ref name="mh-zidic"/&gt;

The wedding cleric himself was also killed in the incident.&lt;ref name=yahoo/&gt; Two girls allegedly survived by hiding under the corpses of associates.&lt;ref name=yahoo/&gt; One whole family, composed of two adult parents and six children between the ages of three and twelve at the time of their deaths, were slaughtered.&lt;ref name=yahoo/&gt; Several [[Keening|wailing women]] pursued the ambulances bearing 17 corpses to a Mardin morgue.&lt;ref name=yahoo/&gt;

One man whose nephew was murdered described the scene as "horrifying", saying "you could not believe your eyes".&lt;ref name="Many die in Turkey wedding attack"/&gt; Another involved man claimed the slaughter began "after they took their position to perform prayers" and that explosives had been used to dismember the faces of the victims.&lt;ref name="Many die in Turkey wedding attack"/&gt; Schoolteacher Sadik Akbulut attended the engagement ceremony alongside his wife, Bedia Akbulut, but survived after he failed to wake up in time for the party.&lt;ref name="8 Arrested in Turkish Wedding Shooting"/&gt; Bedia claimed they heard shots being fired and that her husband dimmed the lights.&lt;ref name="8 Arrested in Turkish Wedding Shooting"/&gt;

Approximately two hundred guests attended the engagement ceremony.&lt;ref name="Many die in Turkey wedding attack"/&gt; Allegations of a family feud surfaced when it emerged that there was a similarity between the dead and those who left them in this state.&lt;ref name="8 Arrested in Turkish Wedding Shooting" /&gt; However, it has been said that this feud was settled around twenty years previously.&lt;ref name="8 Arrested in Turkish Wedding Shooting"/&gt; The marriage is thought to have reopened the feud amongst factions which "strongly disagreed" with its occurrence.&lt;ref name="8 Arrested in Turkish Wedding Shooting"/&gt; It has been described as "a combination of tribalism, love for guns, and tradition gone awfully wrong".&lt;ref name="Blood feuds, gun violence plague Turkey's southeast"/&gt;

It is unclear if the bride and groom had completed the required steps to become legally married. While some reports refer to them in unmarried terms,&lt;ref name="8 Arrested in Turkish Wedding Shooting"/&gt; others refer to them in married terms.&lt;ref name="Blood feuds, gun violence plague Turkey's southeast"/&gt;

== Perpetrators ==
Speculation as to the cause and identity of the perpetrators circulated via the local media after the incident. One suggestion had a long-term village family feud.&lt;ref name="Many die in Turkey wedding attack"/&gt; Another suggestion blamed the Village Guards, a shadowy militia force established in 1984 to assist government troops in battles against the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]].&lt;ref name="Many die in Turkey wedding attack"/&gt; Those who carried out the attack were disguised in masks.&lt;ref name="8 Arrested in Turkish Wedding Shooting"/&gt;

The perpetrators fled after the attack to the nearby [[Syria]]n border as a sandstorm in the area intensified.&lt;ref name="8 Arrested in Turkish Wedding Shooting"/&gt;&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090504/ap_on_re_eu/eu_turkey_attack "Associated Foreign Press article"] Yahoo.

Soldiers blockaded roads leading into the village after the incident and journalists were forbidden to enter.&lt;ref name=yahoo/&gt; Electricity supplies and telephone access were also cut off.&lt;ref name=yahoo/&gt;

Later, a village guard, Mehmet Çelebi admitted the massacre.&lt;ref name="Posta"/&gt;

==Rehabilitation of orphaned children==
The government and civic organizations set up a rehabilitation program in June 2009 in the form of [[occupational therapy]] for the children orphaned with the aim to lessen their pain and make them forget the memories of the massacre. A sports center was established in the village by the national [[gymnast]] [[Nuri Batır]] to provide lessons in gymnastics, athletics and swimming. Major sponsors of the project were the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism]] and Middle East College in [[Diyarbakır]].&lt;ref name="hdn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=bilge-massacre-orphans-try-to-forget-pain-through-sports-2009-08-13 |newspaper=Hürriyet Daily news |title=Bilge massacre orphans try to forget pain through sports |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2009-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

35 of the 62 [[orphan]]s took part at the sports lessons.&lt;ref name="akn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aknews.com/tr/aknews/3/65530/ |newspaper=AK News |title=Bilge köyü çocukları barış elçisi oluyor |date=2009-08-23 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2009-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707102206/http://www.aknews.com/tr/aknews/3/65530/ |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After only one week of training, the children attended a sports contest in [[Batman, Turkey|Batman]] and achieved seventh place among 15 teams.&lt;ref name="hdn"/&gt;

Their show called "Bilge Village Peace Flowers" took later place at school openings in Mardin, Diyarbakır and [[Ankara]]. A show named "Peace Shows" was prepared for staging in neighboring countries including [[Cyprus]], [[Northern Cyprus]], [[Azerbaijan]], Northern Iraq, [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="hdn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="akn"/&gt;

A twelve-year-old girl, who had lost both her mother and father in the violence, said the sports activities helped her forget the event. She continued that performing shows for children of other countries will be most exciting for her since "I do not want to see children losing their mothers and fathers anymore," adding "I want peace and brotherhood."&lt;ref name="hdn"/&gt;

'''Overdetermination''' occurs when a single-observed effect is determined by multiple causes, any one of which alone would be sufficient to account for ("determine") the effect. That is, there are more causes present than are necessary to cause the effect. In the [[philosophy of science]], this means that more evidence is available than is necessary to justify a conclusion. Overdetermination is in contrast to [[underdetermination]], when the number or strength of causes is insufficient. 

The term "overdetermination" ({{lang-de|Überdeterminierung}}) was also used by [[Sigmund Freud]] as a key concept in his [[psychoanalysis]].

==Freud and psychoanalysis==

Freud wrote in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' that many features of dreams were usually "overdetermined," in that they were caused by multiple factors in the life of the dreamer, from the "residue of the day" (superficial memories of recent life) to deeply repressed traumas and unconscious wishes, these being "potent thoughts".  Freud favored interpretations which accounted for such features not only once, but many times, in the context of various levels and complexes of the dreamer's psyche.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. chapter 6, "The Dream-Work", section b., "The work of displacement".&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was later borrowed for a variety of other realms of thought.

==In analytic philosophy==

In contemporary [[analytic philosophy]] an event or state of affairs is said to be ''overdetermined'' if it has two or more distinct, [[sufficient causes]].   In philosophy of mind, the famous case of overdetermination is called mental-physical causal overdetermination. If we accept that a mental state (M) is realized by a physical state (P). And M can cause another mental state (M*) or another physical state (P*). Then, nomologically speaking, P can cause M* or P* too. In this way, M* or P* is both determined by M and P. In other words, both M* and P* are overdetermined. Since either M or P is sufficient for M* or P*, the problem of mental-physical causal overdetermination is the causal redundancy. 

Whereas there may unproblematically be recognised many different ''necessary'' conditions of the event's occurrence, no two distinct events may lay claim to be sufficient conditions, since this would lead to overdetermination. A much used example is that of [[firing squad]]s, the members of which simultaneously firing at and 'killing' their targets. Apparently, no one member can be said to have caused the victims' deaths, since he or she would have been killed anyway. Another example is that Billy and Suzy each throw a rock through a window, and either rock alone could have shattered the window. In this case, similar to the example of firing squads, Billy and Suzy ''together'' shatter the window and the result is not overdetermined. Or, we can say, even if these two examples are a kind of overdetermination, this kind of overdetermination is benign.

There are many problems of overdetermination. First, overdetermination is problematic in particular from the viewpoint of a standard [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] understanding of causation, according to which an event is the cause of another event if and only if the latter would not have occurred, had the former not occurred. In order to employ this formula to actual complex situations, implicit or explicit conditions need to be accepted to be circumstantial, since the list of counterfactually acceptable causes would otherwise be impractically long (e.g. the Earth's continued existence could be said to be the (necessary) cause of one drinking one's coffee). Unless a circumstance-clause is included, the putative cause to which one wishes to draw attention could never be considered sufficient, and hence not comply with the counterfactual analysis. Second, overdetermination is problematic in that we do not know how to explain where the extra causation "comes from" and "goes". This makes overdetermination mysterious.

==Richards and literature==

The [[New Critic]] [[I. A. Richards]] used the idea of overdetermination to explain the importance of [[ambiguity]] in [[rhetoric]], the [[philosophy of language]], and [[literary criticism]].

==Althusser and structuralist Marxism==

The [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist philosopher]] [[Louis Althusser]] imported the concept into [[Marxist political theory]] in an influential essay, "Contradiction and overdetermination." Drawing from both Freud and [[Mao Zedong]], Althusser used the idea of overdetermination as a way of thinking about the multiple, often opposed, forces active at once in any political situation, without falling into an overly simple idea of these forces being simply "contradictory."  Brewster, in Althusser et al.'s ''[[Reading Capital]]'' defines overdetermination as such:

''"the representation of dream thoughts in images privileged by their condensation of a number of thoughts in a single image (condensation), or by the transference of psychic energy from  a particularly potent thought to apparently trivial things ... [For Althusser] overdetermination of a contradiction is the reflection in it of its conditions of existence within the complex whole."''

An instance of a popular riot calling for revolution could exemplify overdetermination.  The event has to it, in capitalist culture, an over-application (determination) of agitation. The determinant contradictions (the reasons for popular revolt) are not addressed and so their great mass is "displaced" onto the singular event.

'''Robert Fitzroy 'Roy' Foster''', [[British Academy|FBA]], [[Royal Historical Society|FRHistS]], [[Royal Society of Literature|FRSL]] (born 16 January 1949), publishing as '''R. F. Foster''', is an [[Irish people|Irish]] historian and academic. He was the Carroll Professor of [[History of Ireland|Irish History]] from 1991 until 2016 at [[Hertford College, Oxford]], in [[Great Britain]].

==Early life==
Foster was born on 16 January 1949 in [[Waterford]], to two teachers: Betty Foster (née Fitzroy), a primary teacher, and 'Fef' (Ernest) Foster, a teacher of [[Irish language|Irish]]. His father, Fef, was a native of [[Drung parish|Drung]], a tiny hamlet and parish located between [[Cavan Town]] and [[Cootehill]] in [[County Cavan]]. Roy attended [[Newtown School, Waterford|Newtown School]] in Waterford, a multi-denominational school that was founded as a [[Quaker]] school in the late 18th century. He won a scholarship to attend [[St. Andrew's School (Delaware)|St. Andrew's School]] in [[Delaware]] for a year before reading history at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. He was awarded an M.A. and PhD by Trinity College, where he was taught by [[T. W. Moody]] and [[F.S.L. Lyons]], and was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin|elected a scholar]] in History and Political Science in 1969.

==Academic career==
Prior to his appointment to the Carroll professorship, he was Professor of Modern British History at [[Birkbeck, University of London]], [[University of London]], and held visiting fellowships at [[St Antony's College, Oxford]], the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], Princeton, and [[Princeton University]]. Based in London as well as at Hertford College in Oxford, Foster visits Ireland frequently.

His work is generally published under the name R. F. Foster.

He has written early biographies of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], edited ''The Oxford History of Ireland'' (1989), and written ''Modern Ireland: 1600–1972'' (1988) and several books of essays. Foster produced a much-acclaimed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lrb.co.uk/v19/n06/frank-kermode/what-he-did |title=What he did |work=[[London Review of Books]] |date=20 March 1997 |accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n05/john-kerrigan/old-old-old-old-old |title=Old, Old, Old, Old, Old |work=London Review of Books |date=3 March 2005 |accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; two-part biography of [[William Butler Yeats]] which was awarded the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]], and collaborated with [[Fintan Cullen]] on a National Portrait Gallery exhibition, 'Conquering England: the Irish in Victorian London'. Seamus Deane wrote a review in the ''Irish Times'' of 27 September 2003 quoting W.B. Yeats as saying "My glory was that I had such friends". Deane then suggests that Yeats was also lucky in having such a biographer as Foster.

In 2000 Foster was a judge in the [[Man Booker Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/table/2008/sep/29/booker-prize-winners-shortlists |title=Booker prize winners, shortlists and judges |work=The Guardian |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Renaissance studies''' (also ''Renaissance and Early Modern Studies'') is the interdisciplinary study of [[the Renaissance]] and [[early modern period]]. The field of study often incorporates knowledge from history, art history, literature, music, architecture, history of science, philosophy, classics, and medieval studies.

==Centers and Universities with Renaissance studies==
Renaissance studies programs exist at several universities, ether an independent field of study or as a subset of [[medieval studies]].

A '''rochet''' is a white [[vestment]] generally worn by a Roman Catholic or Anglican [[bishop]] in [[choir dress]]. It is unknown in the Eastern churches.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Rochet |volume=23 |pages=431–432 |first1=Joseph |last1=Braun |first2=Walter Alison |last2=Phillips |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rochet in its Roman form is similar to a [[surplice]], except that the sleeves are narrower. In its Anglican form it is a descendent of the traditional albs worn by deacons and priests. In the Roman Catholic tradition, the rochet comes below the knee and its sleeves and hem are sometimes made of lace; in the Anglican tradition, the rochet comes down almost to the hem of the cassock and its sleeves are gathered at the wrist.

The word stems from the Latin ''rochettum'' (from the late Latin ''roccus'', connected with the Old High German ''roch'', ''roc'' and the A.S. ''rocc''; Dutch ''koorhemd, rochet'', French ''rochet'', German ''Rochett, Chorkleid'', Italian ''rocchetto'', Spanish ''roquete''), means an ecclesiastical vestment.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Catholic use ==
In the [[Catholic Church]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], bishops and certain other dignitaries use a rochet, a garment that is worn over the [[cassock]] for non-eucharistic functions.

The Catholic rochet is a tunic of white, usually fine [[linen]] or [[muslin]] ([[batiste]], mull) reaching about to the knee, and distinguished from the [[surplice]] mainly by the narrower sleeves which make its arms tight-fitting, and is frequently trimmed with [[lace]]. The lower edge and the sleeves may also be garnished with lace, lined with violet or red silk in the case of prelates, or more rarely with embroidered borders.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The rochet is proper to, and distinctive of, [[prelate]]s and [[bishop]]s, but the right to wear it is sometimes granted by the [[pope]] to others, especially the canons of cathedral churches. It is not a ''vestis sacra'', and cannot therefore be used as a substitute for the [[surplice]], e.g. in the administering of the Sacraments (Decree of the Congregation of Rites of January 10, 1852). Nonetheless, since it is used at choir services and is ordered to be worn over the everyday dress at Mass (Missa rom. Rit. celebr. i. 2), it may be included among liturgical vestments in the widest sense.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; It is worn instead of a surplice by [[Canons Regular]] as part of their habit for liturgical use alone.

The earliest notice of the use of the rochet is found in an inventory of the vestments of the Roman clergy, dating from the 9th century. In this it is called ''camisia'', a name which it retained at Rome until the 14th century, and it seems to have been already at that time proper to particular members of the clergy. Other Roman names for the vestment were ''succa, sucta''; it was not till the 14th century that the name ''rochettum'' appeared at Rome, but it was not long before it had superseded all the native designations.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Outside Rome, too, the vestment is early met with, e.g. in the Frankish empire (9th century) as ''alba clericalis'', in contrast to the liturgical [[alb]], and in England (10th century) under the name of ''oferslip'' in the 46th canon of the ecclesiastical laws of Edgar. At the beginning of the 12th century the rochet is mentioned, under the name of ''camisia'', by Gilbert of Limerick and by Honorius, and, somewhat later, by Gerloh of Reichersperg as ''tunica talaris''. From the 13th century onward it is frequently mentioned. The name ''rocheltum'' is first traceable in England; in Germany and northern France the rochet was also called ''sarohi'' (Latinized ''sarrotus'') or ''sarcos'' (Latinized ''sarcotium'').&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[Image:Sint-Salvatorskapittel Bruges Precious Blood 2008.JPG|thumb|Canons in Bruges]]

Outside Rome the rochet was, until well into the 14th century, a vestment common to all the clergy, and especially to those of the lower orders; and so it remained, in general, until the 16th century, and even, here and there, so late as the 19th. Moreover, in further contrast to the Roman use, it had, especially in the German dioceses, a liturgical character, being used instead of the surplice.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The rochet was originally a robe-like tunic, and was therefore girdled, like the liturgical alb. So as late as 1260 the provincial synod of Cologne decreed that the ''vestis camisialis'' must be long enough entirely to cover the everyday dress. A good example of the camisia of the 12th century is the rochet of Thomas Becket, preserved at Dammartin in the Pas de Calais, the only surviving medieval example remarkable for the pleating which, as was the case with albs also, gave greater breadth and more elaborate folds. In the 15th century the rochet only reached halfway down the shin; in the 16th and 17th to the knee; in the 18th and 19th often only to the middle of the thigh.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In the Middle Ages it was always plain.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Anglican use ==

In the [[Anglican Church]]es the rochet is a vestment peculiar to bishops and is worn by them in choir dress with the [[chimere]], both in ministration in church and also on ceremonial occasions outside, e.g. sitting in the [[House of Lords]], attending a royal levee,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; or [[Graduation|commencement]] ceremony. It may be worn with a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], [[cope]] and [[mitre]] for more dignified occasions (such as [[Baptism]] outside the context of the [[Eucharist]], Solemn [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]], royal weddings and the [[coronation]] of the [[Monarch|Sovereign]]).
[[File:Archbishop of Canterbury visits the Mateer Memorial Church in October 2010.jpg|thumb|Then-Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr [[Rowan Williams]], visiting India in 2010; the local Anglican bishops are wearing the more usual gathered sleeves.]]

In general it has retained the medieval form more closely than the Roman rochet and more resembles the [[alb]], insofar as it is of plain, very fine linen, and reaches almost to the feet. Where the Roman rochet is descended from the surplice, the rochet in its Anglican form is equal to that of the earlier style albs worn by priests. The main modifications have been in the (usually) baggy 'lawn' sleeves that are gathered at the wrists with a band of black or scarlet cloth. At the time of the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] these were still narrow, though already showing a tendency to expand. The portrait of [[Archbishop Warham]] at [[Lambeth]], for instance, shows a rochet with fairly wide sleeves narrowing towards the wrists, where they are confined by fur cuffs. This fashion continued until, in the 17th century, the sleeves became much fuller; only in the 18th century did they develop into the familiar exaggerated balloon shape, confined at the wrists by a ribbon, beyond which a ruffle projected. About the same period, too, arose the custom of making the rochet sleeveless and attaching the lawn sleeves to the chimere. This remained the fashion most of the 19th century, but there has since been a tendency to revert to the earlier less exaggerated form, and the sleeves have been reattached to the rochet. The ribbon by which the wrist is confined is red, except when conducting or participating in a formal, public funeral (e.g. of a head of state), when it is black.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The rochet is worn without the chimere under the cope by those bishops who use this vestment. At his [[consecration]] the bishop-elect is, according to the [[rubric]], presented to the consecrating bishops vested in a rochet only; after the [[Christian laying on of hands|laying on of hands]] he retires and puts on the rest of the episcopal habit; i.e. the chimere.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
 
One exception to the normal Anglican-style is the rochet worn by the previous [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams]] which has open-ended narrow sleeves in the manner of the Roman rochet.

'''Sena''' (Arabic), sometimes spelled ''Senna'', ''Sanaw'' or ''Sanāw'' (the latter three names also Arabic),  is an abandoned [[ancient]] town in [[Yemen]] located in the remote eastern [[Hadramaut]] valley.&lt;ref name="Preez2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Preez|first=Max Du|title=Of Warriors, Lovers, and Prophets: Unusual Stories from South Africa's Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iiQFWkkn67oC&amp;pg=PT171|year=2004|publisher=Zebra|isbn=978-1-86872-901-2|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; This village is distinct from the capital of [[Yemen]], [[San'a]] (Arabic),  and the town of ''Sanāw'' in [[Oman]].

==Overview==
Sena was a thriving [[Jewish]] city at the time of the Babylonian empire around 500 BC, and is believed to have been dominated by Israelites who had fled [[Jerusalem]] during the Babylonian invasion. They crossed the [[Jordan]] into Yemen, believing they were safe in the valley in the east, crossing the [[Masilah River]].&lt;ref name="Preez2004"/&gt; According to hydrologists, agriculture in the dry valley was only made possible by a dam; when this broke leaving no water, the inhabitants of the city were forced to move or face starvation.

British anthropologist [[Tudor Parfitt]], who specializes in Jewish studies, believes the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was kept in the town for some time before it was taken across to Africa,&lt;ref name="Khatri"&gt;{{cite book|last=Khatri|first=Vikas|title=World Famous Treasures Lost and Found|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZF4KUUanU0C&amp;pg=PT214|publisher=Pustak Mahal|isbn=978-81-223-1274-4|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the Israelites leaving Sena settled along the [[Limpopo River]] in [[Zimbabwe]]. The town of Sena is frequently mentioned in the history of the [[Lemba people|Lemba]] tribe; more recently genetic studies have found signs that they may be descendants of the Israelites.&lt;ref name="Wahrman2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wahrman|first=Miryam Z.|title=Brave New Judaism: When Science and Scripture Collide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYXcRVGNznEC&amp;pg=PA150|date=1 January 2004|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-58465-032-4|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|Religious book, no matter how concerned with squaring religion with science|date=January 2017}}

Today the deserted town is occupied only five days a year by pilgrims, and the area is under a garrison of the Yemeni army.

[[File:Guildford Museum Castle Arch.jpg|thumb|Castle Arch, Guildford]] 
'''Surrey Archaeological Society''' is a county [[archaeology|archaeological]] society, founded in 1854 for "the investigation of subjects connected with the history and antiquities of the County of [[Surrey]]" in England. 

==Remit==
The Society concerns itself with "the County of Surrey within the boundaries existing in 1854 … and as may be enlarged by any extension of the present Administrative County". Its geographical interests therefore cover, in addition to the modern administrative county of Surrey, the areas now forming the [[London borough]]s of [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]], [[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth]], [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]], [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]], [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]], [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]], and [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond]]; as well as the district of [[Borough of Spelthorne|Spelthorne]], which became part of the county only in 1965. Where appropriate, however, the Society works in close cooperation with other archaeological agencies, such as [[Museum of London Archaeology]].

==Headquarters and activities==
The Society's headquarters, which include an extensive library, are located at Castle Arch, [[Guildford]]. The building also houses [[Guildford Museum]], itself originally established by the Society, although now quite independent. The Society incorporates nine Special Interest Groups: the Artefacts and Archives Recording Group; the Local History Group; the Medieval Studies Forum; the Prehistoric Group; the Roman Studies Group; the Surrey Industrial History Group; the Villages Study Group; the Guildford Archaeology and Local History Group; and the Research Committee.

==Publications==
The Society's official [[Academic journal|journal]] is ''Surrey Archaeological Collections'', first published in 1858, and which now appears annually.

Since 1973, the journal has been supplemented by ''Surrey History'', a more popular historical magazine. The Society also issues a regular bimonthly ''Bulletin'', containing news, short reports and articles, and notices of forthcoming events.

The Society has also published a number of occasional single issue publications, notably in its Research Volumes, Research Papers and Village Studies series. It has published two larger multi-authored volumes providing a broader overview of the county's archaeology and history: 
*{{cite book |editor1-first=Joanna |editor1-last=Bird |editor2-first=D.G. |editor2-last=Bird |title=The Archaeology of Surrey to 1540 |publisher=Surrey Archaeological Society |place=Guildford |year=1987 |isbn=0950134562 }}
*{{cite book |editor1-first=Jonathan |editor1-last=Cotton |editor2-first=Glenys |editor2-last=Crocker |editor3-first=Audrey |editor3-last=Graham |title=Aspects of Archaeology and History in Surrey: towards a research framework for the county |publisher=Surrey Archaeological Society |place=Guildford |year=2004 |isbn=0954146034 }}

The Surrey Industrial History Group publishes its own ''Newsletter'', and other occasional publications.

In 1894 the Society published a [[Calendar (archives)|calendar]] of medieval Surrey [[feet of fines]], edited by Frank Lewis, as "''Surrey Archaeological Collections'', Extra Volume 1". In the event this was the only "extra volume" ever published. In 1912, the honorary secretary, [[Hilary Jenkinson]] (himself an [[archivist]]), finding a lack of enthusiasm within the society for further sustained record publication, established the [[Surrey Record Society]] as an independent body, and the two societies have coexisted amicably ever since.

==Notable members==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1189">The '''Tarkhan Dress''', named for the [[Tarkhan (Egypt)|Tarkhan]] cemetery south of [[Cairo]] in [[Egypt]] where it was excavated in 1913, is an over 5000 years old [[linen]] [[garment]] that was confirmed as the world's oldest piece of woven [[clothing]]. 

The dress coded UC28614B is currently in the collection of the [[University College London]] (UCL) Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology. [[Radiocarbon testing]] conducted in 2015 by the [[University of Oxford]] affirms, with 95% accuracy, that the dress dates from between 3482 and 3102 BCE.

'''''The Modern Antiquarian: A Pre-Millennial Odyssey Through Megalithic Britain''''' is a bestselling and critically acclaimed guide book written by [[Julian Cope]], published in 1998. It is written as a travelogue of British [[megalith]]ic sites, including [[Stonehenge]] and [[Avebury]]. Types of artifacts cataloged include [[stone circle]]s, [[hillfort]]s and [[Tumulus|barrows]].

In the introduction Cope explains how a visit to Avebury Stone Circle inspired his enthusiasm for the subject. He was disappointed with the quality of available guidebooks, so decided to write his own. He visited and researched hundreds of sites over eight years, selecting about 300 of the most significant for the book.

The book is divided into two sections, the first being ten essays by Cope about various aspects of megalithic British culture. The second section and the bulk of the book is a geographically arranged gazetteer of the sites. Each entry includes an essay, directions to the site, map references, Cope's own account of his visit, photographs and drawings.

* Ethanol was first isolated from wine in approximately 1100 and was found to burn shortly thereafter. These early solutions distilled from wine-salt mixtures were referred to as aqua ardens (burning water) or aqua flamens (flaming water) and had such low alcohol content that they burned without producing noticeable heat. By the 13th century, the development of the cooling coil allowed the isolation of nearly pure ethanol by distillation.&lt;ref&gt;Seth C. Rasmussen. How Glass changed the World. The History and Chemistry of Glass from Antiquity to the 13th Century. Springer Briefs in Molecular Science: History of Chemistry; Rasmussen, S. C., Ed.; Springer: Heidelberg, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ethanol has been used for [[lamp oil]] and cooking, along with plant and animal oils.&lt;ref&gt;Hal Bernton, William Kovarik, Scott Sklar, The Forbidden Fuel: A History of Power Alcohol, Bison Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Small alcohol stoves (also called "[[spirit lamp]]s") were commonly used by travelers in the 17th century to warm food and themselves.
* '''Before the [[American Civil War]]''' many farmers in the United States had an alcohol [[still]] to turn crop waste into free lamp oil and stove fuel for the farmers' family use. Conflict over taxation was not unusual; one example was the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] in 1791.
* In '''1826''', [[Samuel Morey]] uses alcohol in the first American [[internal combustion engine]]  prototype.&lt;ref&gt;Horst Hardenberg, Samuel Morey and his Atmospheric Engine (Warrendale, Pa.: Society of Automotive Engineers, Feb. 1992), SP922&lt;/ref&gt;
* In  the '''1830s,''' alcohol blends had replaced increasingly expensive whale oil in most parts of the country. It "easily took the lead as the illuminant" because it was "a decided improvement on other oils then in use."    &lt;ref&gt;History of Light, pamphlet by the Welsbach Gas Co., Philadelphia Penn, 1909; on file in the Smithsonian collection of Advertising, Museum of American History, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;
* By '''1860,''' thousands of distilleries churned out at least {{convert|90|e6USgal|m3}} of alcohol per year for lighting. Camphene / alcohol blends (at $.50 per gallon) were cheaper than whale oil ($1.30 to $2.50 per gallon) and lard oil (90 cents per gallon). It was about the same price as coal oil, which was the product first marketed as "kerosene." &lt;ref&gt;Free Alcohol Law, Senate Finance Committee Hearings on HR 24816, Feb. 1907, Doc. No. 362, page 320; also [[Harold F. Williamson]] &amp; Arnold R. Daum, The American Petroleum Industry, 1859-1899, The Age of Illumination (Evanston Ill NW U Press, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1860''', German inventor [[Nikolaus Otto]] uses ethyl alcohol as a fuel in an early internal combustion engine.&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Cummins, Internal Fire (Warrenton, Pa.: Society of Automotive Engineers, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1862''' and '''1864''', a tax on alcohol was passed in the U.S. to pay for the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], increasing the price of ethanol to over $2.00 per gallon. A new product from petroleum, called [[kerosene]], is taxed at 10 cents a gallon.&lt;ref&gt;Free alcohol hearings, U.S. Senate 1907, p. 320. Also, Free Alcohol Hearings, House Ways &amp; Means Committee, 59th Congress, Feb.-Mar. 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 19th century, [[spirit lamp]]s, [[pigeon lamp]]s and others used a variety of blends of alcohol and oils in Europe. Alcohol powered not only automobiles and farm machinery but also a wide variety of lamps, stoves, heaters, laundry irons, hair curlers, coffee roasters and every conceivable household appliance. By one estimate, some 95,000 alcohol fueled stoves and 37,000 spirit lamps had been manufactured in Germany by 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Robert N. Tweedy, Industrial Alcohol (Dublin, Ireland: Plunkett House, 1917).&lt;/ref&gt;
* By the '''1890s''', alcohol-fueled engines are starting to be used in farm machinery in Europe, making countries more fuel independent. Research at the [[Experimental Mechanical Laboratory]] of Paris and at the [[Deutsche Landwirtschaftliche Gesellschaft]] in Berlin in the 1890s helped pave the way for expanded use of alcohol fuel.
* By '''1896''', horseless [[carriage]]s (cars) were showing up on roads in Europe and the United States. Because gasoline is so cheap and abundant, and also because ethanol is taxed at a high level, early US automobiles are adapted to gasoline from the beginning. Racing cars, on the other hand, usually used ethanol (and other alcohols) because more power could be developed in a smaller, lighter engine. [[Charles Edgar Duryea]] builds the first U.S. gasoline powered car but is aware of Samuel Morey's ethanol fueled experimental car of 1826. [[Henry Ford]]'s first car, the [[Quadracycle]], is also built that year. The car runs on gasoline, but Ford is aware of experiments with ethanol in Germany, and subsequently backs the lifting of the U.S. tax on industrial uses of ethanol.
* In '''1899''', the [[Germany|German]] government taxed petroleum imports and subsidized domestic ethanol. [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] "was enraged at the Oil Trust of his country, and offered prizes to his subjects and cash assistance ... to adapt [alcohol] to use in the industries."&lt;ref&gt;"Launching of a Great Industry: The Making of Cheap Alcohol," ''The New York Times'', Nov. 25, 1906, Section III p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1901''', the French ministry of agriculture offered prizes for the best alcohol-fueled engines and household appliances.
* In '''1902''', the [[Paris]] alcohol fuel exposition exhibited alcohol powered cars, farm machinery, lamps, stoves, heaters, laundry irons, hair curlers, coffee roasters, and every conceivable household appliance and agricultural engine powered by alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Congress des Applications de L'Alcool Denature, 16 au 23 Dec., 1902, Automobile-Club de France, National Agricultural Library collection, Beltsville, Md.&lt;/ref&gt; This exhibit traveled widely through Europe and was featured at the 1907 Jamestown Virginia tricentennial celebrations.
* In '''1906''', the ''[[Free Alcohol]]'' bill is passed. The USA repeals the alcohol tax under [[Teddy Roosevelt]]. At 14 cents per US gallon, corn ethanol was cheaper than gasoline at 22 cents per US gallon. Bills pass that exempt farm stills from government control. In backing the bill, U.S. President [[Teddy Roosevelt]] says: "The Standard Oil Company has, largely by unfair or unlawful methods, crushed out home competition... It is highly desirable that an element of competition should be introduced by the passage of some such law as that which has already passed in the House, putting alcohol used in the arts and manufacturers upon the [tax] free list." &lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, May 5, 1906, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Starting in '''1901''', the discovery of new oil fields in [[Texas]] causes the price of gasoline to drop to between 18 and 22 cents per US gallon by '''1906''', undercutting farm ethanol markets
* In '''1908''', the [[Ford Model T]] is introduced. Early models had adjustable carburetors to run on ethanol with gasoline as an option.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fuel-testers.com/ethanol_fuel_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/19990427234325/http://www.greenfuels.org/ethahist.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1909''', the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] reports: "In regard to general cleanliness, such as absence of smoke and disagreeable odors, alcohol has many advantages over gasoline or kerosene as a fuel… The exhaust from an alcohol engine is never clouded with a black or grayish smoke."  Overall, alcohol was "a more ideal fuel than gasoline." &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of Interior, Robert M. Strong, "Commercial Deductions from Comparisons of Gasoline and Alcohol Tests on Internal Combustion Engines,"   U.S. Geological Survey, Bulletin 392, (Washington: GPO, 1909); Also, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, C.E. Lucke, Columbia University, and S.M. Woodward, U.S.DA, "The Use of Alcohol and Gasoline in Farm Engines," U.S.D.A. Farmers Bulletin No. 277, (Washington: GPO, 1907).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1914''', the ''Free Alcohol'' bill is amended again to decrease the regulatory burden and encourage alcohol fuel production in the U.S.
* In '''1917''' [[Alexander Graham Bell]] says:  "Alcohol makes a beautiful, clean and efficient fuel… Alcohol can be manufactured from corn stalks, and in fact from almost any vegetable matter capable of fermentation… We need never fear the exhaustion of our present fuel supplies so long as we can produce an annual crop of alcohol to any extent desired."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Graham Bell, National Geographic, Vol. 31, Feb. 1917, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1918''', ''[[Scientific American]]'' says it is "now definitely established that alcohol can be blended with gasoline to produce a suitable fuel …" &lt;ref&gt;Scientific American, "Alcohol as an Automobile Fuel," July 6, 1918&lt;/ref&gt;  Another article notes that the [[Pasteur Institute of France]] found it could obtain {{convert|10|USgal|L}} of ethanol per ton of [[seaweed]].&lt;ref&gt;Scientific American, "Seaweed as a Source of Alcohol," Nov. 9, 1918, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1919''', [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition of beverage alcohol in the U.S.]] leads to suggestions for more ethanol use as an anti-knock blend with gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific American,"Shall the Corn Fields Run Our Cars: The possibilities of synthetic fuels and the source of the alcohol to make them," Sept. 18, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; Farm belt politicians are split on ethanol as a fuel. While distillers could have a new market for their alcohol, some thought that allowing any distillery to stay open would be a "bargain with the devil."
* In the '''1920s''' and '''1930s''', Koolmotor, Benzalcool, Moltaco, Lattybentyl, Natelite, Alcool and Agrol are some of the [[common ethanol fuel mixtures|gasoline-ethanol]] blends of fuels once found in Britain, Italy, Hungary, Sweden, South Africa, Brazil and the USA (respectively).
* In '''1920''', [[David White (geologist)|David White]], chief geologist of US Geological Survey, estimates total oil remaining in the US at {{convert|6.7|Goilbbl|m3}}. "In making this estimate, which included both proved reserves and resources still remaining to be discovered, White conceded that it might well be in error by as much as 25 percent." &lt;ref&gt;"Asserts Americans face oil shortage," ''The New York Times'', May 3, 1920, p. 22; also, Wallace B. Pratt, Vice President, Standard Oil Company (New Jersey), "Our Oil and Natural Gas Reserves," Chapter V, in ed. Leonard M. Fanning, Our Oil Resources, (New York: McGraw Hill Book Co. Inc., 1945), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1921''', [[leaded gasoline]] is developed at the [[General Motors]] research laboratories in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. GM researcher [[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] still maintains: "The most direct route which we now know for converting energy from its source, the sun, into a material that is suitable for use in an internal combustion motor is through vegetation to alcohol… It now appears that alcohol is the only liquid from a direct vegetable source that combines relative cheapness with suitability (although other sources might be found)…  Alcohol will stand very high initial compressions without knocking, and at high compressions is smooth and highly satisfactory.".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Midgley, Jr., "Our Liquid Fuel Reserves," unpublished paper to the Indiana Section of the Society of Automotive Engineers, 12 October 1921; also see Thomas Midgley, Jr. and T.A. Boyd, "The Application of Chemistry to the Conservation of Motor Fuels," Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, September, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1921''', British engineer [[Harry Ricardo]] patents racing fuels RD1 and RD2 (for Ricardo Discol) that contained [[methanol]] and ethanol, [[acetone]] and small amounts of water. These were widely used on race tracks throughout Europe and the US in the 1920s and 30s.
* In '''1923''' leaded gasoline is marketed, and by 1924 GM and [[Standard Oil Co.]] form the [[Ethyl Corp.]] Ethyl claims it has "solved" the problem of engine knock, but public health scientists (e.g. [[Alice Hamilton]] of [[Harvard University]]) are appalled at the prospects for lead poisoning and insist that alternatives such as ethanol blends are available.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Kovarik, "Charles F. Kettering and the Development of Tetraethyl Lead in the Context of Technological Alternatives," Society of Automotive Engineers, Fuels &amp; Lubricants Division, Historical Colloquium, Baltimore, Md. Oct. 17, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1923''' [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] engine designer Harry Ricardo writes:  "…It is a matter of absolute necessity to find an alternative fuel. Fortunately, such a fuel is in sight in the form of alcohol; this is a vegetable product whose consumption involves no drain on the world’s storage and which, in tropical countries at all events, can ultimately be produced in quantities sufficient to meet the world’s demand, at all events at the present rate of consumption. By the use of a fuel derived from vegetation, mankind is adapting the sun’s heat to the development of motive power, as it becomes available from day to day; by using mineral fuels, he is consuming a legacy – and  a limited legacy at that – of heat stored away many thousands of years ago. In the one case he is, as it were, living within his income, in the other he is squandering his capital. It is perfectly well known that alcohol is an excellent fuel, and there is little doubt but that sufficient supplies could be produced within the tropical regions of the British empire…" &lt;ref&gt;H.R. Ricardo, The high speed internal combustion engine, 2nd edition, (London: Blackie &amp; Son, Ltd., 1928).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1923''', the price of alcohol from [[molasses]] was less than 20 cents per US gallon, while retail gasoline prices had reached an all-time high of 28 cents per gallon. [[Standard Oil]] experiments with a 10% alcohol, 90% gasoline blend for a few months to increase [[octane]] and stop engine knock.
* In 1923, French assembly passes the Carburant National law requiring gasoline importers to buy alcohol for 10% blends from the State Alcohol Service. The law has a far-reaching impact as many other nations, especially Brazil and other sugar-cane growing countries, were influenced to enact similar laws based on the French and German programs.&lt;ref&gt;William Kovarik, Ethanol's first century, Paper to the XVI International Symposium on Alcohol Fuels, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil  {{cite web |url=http://www.radford.edu/~wkovarik/papers/International.History.Ethanol.Fuel.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227074210/http://www.radford.edu/~wkovarik/papers/International.History.Ethanol.Fuel.html |archivedate=2010-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* By the '''mid-1920s''', ethyl alcohol is blended with gasoline in every industrialized nation, and some blends are showing up as experiments in the United States, but the market is dominated by leaded gasoline.
* In October of '''1924''', a catastrophic miscalculation in the production of leaded gasoline causes  at least 17 refinery deaths and many dozens of permanently debilitating injuries. GM and Standard very nearly abandon leaded gasoline, but decide to defend it, claiming (contrary to their own prior published research) that ""So far as science knows at the present time, [[tetraethyl lead]] is the only material available which can bring about these [antiknock] results." &lt;ref&gt;"Radium Derivative $5,000,000 an ounce / Ethyl Gasoline Defended," ''The New York Times'', 7 April 1925; also U.S. Public Health Service, Proceedings of a Conference to Determine Whether or Not There is a Public Health Question in the Manufacture, Distribution or use of Tetraethyl Lead Gasoline,  PHS Bulletin No. 158, (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Treasury Dept.,  August 1925)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1925''', Henry Ford tells ''[[The New York Times]]'' that ethyl alcohol is "the fuel of the future" which "is going to come from fruit like that sumach out by the road, or from apples, weeds, sawdust -- almost anything. There is fuel in every bit of vegetable matter that can be fermented. There's enough alcohol in one year's yield of an acre of potatoes to drive the machinery necessary to cultivate the fields for a hundred years." &lt;ref&gt;"Ford Predicts Fuel from Vegetation," ''The New York Times'', 20 September 1925,  24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1926''', [[US Public Health Service]] allows leaded gasoline to return to the market.
* In '''1928''' Harry Ricardo, [[National Distillers Co.]] and [[Shell Oil]] introduce an alcohol fuel blend in the United Kingdom called  "Cleveland Discol." The ethanol blend is a popular unleaded gasoline brand and is sold through 1968.&lt;ref&gt;The Ricardo Story: The autobiography of Sir Harry Ricardo, Pioneer of Engine Research, SAE Historical Series, (Warrendale, PA: Society of Automotive Engineers, 1992). Also see William Hawthorne, "Harry Ralph Ricardo. 26 January 1885 -- 18 May 1974"  Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society, Vol. 22. (Nov., 1976),  358-380.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In August '''1930''', the German government required all gasoline importers to buy 2.5% of the volume of their imports from the German Alcohol Monopoly, and the ratio was increased to 6% and then 10% by 1932. Estimates of alcohol used in 1932 vary from 44 million liters to about 175 million liters. Some 36,000 small farm alcohol stills, owned by the monopoly, were in operation at this time.&lt;ref&gt;
E.I. Fulmer, R.M. Hixon, L.M.Christensen, W.F. Coover, 1932. A Preliminary Survey of the use of alcohol as a motor fuel in various countries: Prepared for the members of the Conference held Dec. 10, 1932, to discuss the utilization of agricultural surpluses," Dept. of Chemistry, Iowa State University Archives, Ames, Iowa.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1938, Germany was producing about 267 million liters of ethanol, about two thirds from potatoes and the rest from grain, wood sulfite liquors and beets. Some 89 million liters of methanol were produced from coal, while other synthetic fuels included 550 million liters of [[benzene]] and over one billion liters of synthetic gasoline. All told, 54% of the pre-war German fuel production was derived from non-petroleum sources, of which 8% was ethanol from renewable sources &lt;ref&gt;Gustav Egloff, 1939. Motor Fuel Economy of Europe, Washington, D.C.: American Petroleum Institute;&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the '''1930s''', the [[Dust bowl]] [[drought]] and [[Great Depression]] forced many more farmers to move to the cities looking for work, leaving their alcohol fuel stills behind. Henry Ford, a farmer himself, supported ethanol's use over gas.
* In '''1933''', faced with the 25% unemployment of the Great Depression, the European concept of finding new markets for surplus farm products is widely discussed, with ethanol-gasoline blending among the most significant. Fuel blending experiments begin in Peoria, IL, Spokane WA, Lincoln, NE, and Ames, IA. Federal and state governments consider tax advantages to help ethanol production and increase employment among farmers. By 1935 the [[Chemurgy]] movement emerges, supported by farmers, [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]], and Henry Ford. Along with ethanol, chemurgy research included the industrial development of agricultural raw materials such as [[hemp]], [[soybeans]] and new products from biological materials, such as hemp &amp; soybean plastics and inks.
* In '''1933''', a campaign to end Prohibition in the United States emerges. Concerned about renewed interest in ethanol for fuel, the [[American Petroleum Institute]] begins a campaign&lt;ref&gt;Harry Benge Crozier, Director of Public Relations to members of the public relations advisory committee, American Petroleum Institute, April 24, 1933, Series 4 Box 52, J. Howard Pew papers, Hagley Museum and Library, Wilmington, Del.&lt;/ref&gt; against ethanol blends, claiming such "will harm the petroleum industry and the automobile industry as well as state and national treasuries by reducing [oil] consumption," the sole beneficiaries allegedly being distillers, railroads (which would transport the alcohol) and bootleggers "to whom would be opened brand new fields of fraud."&lt;ref&gt;Bill Kovarik, "Henry Ford, Charles F. Kettering and the Fuel of the Future," Automotive History Review, Spring 1998, No. 32, p. 7 - 27. Reproduced on the Web at http://www.radford.edu/~wkovarik/papers/fuel.html. Originally from a paper of the same name at the Proceedings of the 1996 Automotive History Conference, Henry Ford Museum, Dearborn, Mich. Sept. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Prohibition ends with the passage of the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 5, 1933.
* From '''1933''' to '''1939''', various oil companies and the American Petroleum Institute argued that tax incentives for ethanol would hurt the oil industry, reduce state treasuries, and create a bootlegger' atmosphere around fueling stations. They also claimed alcohol fuel was inferior to gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;American Petroleum Industries Committee, "Economic and technical aspects of Alcohol-gasoline mixtures," Oct. 15, 1935;  American Petroleum Institute, "Analysis of Technical Aspects of Alcohol Gasoline Blends," API Special Technical Committee, No. 216, April 10, 1933. The government did not pass the alcohol fuel incentives.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1937''', the farm chemurgy movement finds backers for the [[Agrol]] ethanol fuel plant, created at Atchison, Kansas. For two years, ethanol blends were sold at around 2,000 service stations in the U.S. Midwest. Agrol plant managers complained of sabotage and bitter infighting by the oil industry, and the cheaper price of gasoline. Agrol sold for 17 cents per gallon, while leaded gasoline sold for 16 cents.
* In '''1939''', Agrol production shuts down.
* In '''1942''', chemists who designed the Agrol ethanol plant, especially [[Leo Christensen]], go to work producing ethanol for [[aviation fuel]] and synthetic "[[Buna-S]]" rubber for [[World War II]]. By 1944, petroleum based synthetic rubber production lags, and three quarters of all tires, raincoats, engine gaskets and other rubber products for the war effort come from ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;US Tariff Commission, Industrial Alcohol, War Changes in Industry Series, Report No. 2, (Washington, GPO: Jan. 1944).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1942''',  a war investigating committee led by then-Senator (and future president) [[Harry Truman]] makes public evidence that the oil industry had colluded with German chemical companies, especially I.G. Farben, to prevent the development of synthetic rubber production in the United States. Standard Oil (Exxon) had entered a partnership that it described as a "full marriage" designed to "outlast the war" no matter who won.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Borkin, The Crime and Punishment of I.G. Farben (New York: Free Press, 1978); also see William Stephenson, A Man Called Intrepid (New York: Ballentine, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1949''', [[S. J .W. Pleeth]], chemist for the [[Cleveland Discol company]] in Great Britain, writes: "The bias aroused by the use of alcohol as a motor fuel has produced [research] results that are incompatible with each other ... Countries with considerable oil deposits -- such as the US -- or which control oil deposits of other lands -- such as Holland -- tend to produce reports antithetical to the use of fuels alternative to petrol; countries with little or no indigenous oil tend to produce favorable reports. The contrast ...  is most marked. One can scarcely avoid the conclusion that the results arrived at are those best suited to the political or economic aims of the country concerned or the industry sponsoring the research. We deplore this partisan use of science, while admitting its existence, even in the present writer." &lt;ref&gt;S.J.W. Pleeth, Alcohol: A Fuel for Internal Combustion Engines (London: Chapman &amp; Hall, 1949).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''1964''', a seven-car crash kills drivers [[Dave MacDonald]] and [[Eddie Sachs]] on the second lap of the [[Indianapolis 500]], as over {{convert|150|USgal|L}} of gasoline burned. [[Johnny Rutherford]], who was also involved in the crash, survived, mainly because his methanol-fueled car had not ignited. The [[United States Auto Club]] bans gasoline and switches all cars to methyl alcohol (methanol), a rule which would stay for 41 years before ending after the 2005 race.
* During the [[Nigerian Civil War]] of '''1967 to 1970''', Engineers in the breakaway republic of  [[Biafra]] resorted to powering vehicles with alcohol. Initially, alcohol was used to supplement the crude oil refining capacity which the fledgling state had under its control, but as the Soviet and UK backed Nigerian army seized the oil producing regions, and with the Nigerian embargo beginning to bite, alcohol became the dominant source of fuel for the economy.
* In '''1971''', the [[Nebraska Agricultural Products Industrial Utilization]] Committee (or "Gasohol" Committee) is formed to find new uses for surplus grain. The commission tests ethanol-gasoline blends in thousands of cars over millions of miles, proving that ethanol can be used as an octane-boosting additive to replace leaded gasoline.
* In '''1973''', Arab oil embargo creates a worldwide energy crisis, leading to intensified search for alternative energy sources.
* In '''1979''', President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s administration creates federal incentives for ethanol production. Federal and state subsidies for ethanol amount to about $11 billion between 1979 and 2000, as compared to about $150 billion in tax credits for the oil industry (from 1968–2000), according to the General Accounting Office.&lt;ref&gt;Petroleum and Ethanol Fuels:  Tax Incentives and Related GAO Work, Report B286311 to Sen. Tom Harkin, Sept. 25, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
* By the '''mid-1980s''', over 100 new corn alcohol production plants are built and over a billion US gallons of ethanol for fuel were sold per year. The ethanol program is controversial for several reasons, not the least of which was that the ethanol industry was dominated by one company – Archer Daniels Midland of Peoria, Ill.
* In '''1984''', the number of ethanol plants peaked at 163 in the U.S., producing {{convert|595|e6USgal|m3}} of ethanol that year.
* In 1988, the [[George H. W. Bush administration]] proposes a cleanup of "air toxics" in gasoline, focusing on replacing benzene octane boosters with ethanol. The proposal leads to one part of the 1990 [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]].
* In the late '''1980s''' and '''1990s''', an oil surplus drives gasoline prices down as low as $12 per barrel, driving most of the ethanol industry into bankruptcy.
* In '''1990''' and '''1992''', Congress passes amendments to the Clean Air Act encouraging the use of ethanol and other oxygenated fuels as replacements for benzene, [[toluene]] and [[xylene]] octane boosters. [[MTBE]] becomes the oil industry's favorite additive, but as water pollution problems were recognized, MTBE is banned in California. Ethanol production rises to the {{convert|4|e9USgal|m3|adj=on}} level.
* Between '''1997''' and '''2002''', three million U.S. cars and light trucks are produced which could run on [[E85]], a blend of 85% ethanol with 15% gasoline. Almost no gas stations sell this fuel however.
* In the early '''2000s''', the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] makes Americans aware of their dependence on foreign oil. This and worry over anthropogenic [[climate change]] causes leading alternative energies like [[biofuel]], solar and wind to expand 20 to 30% yearly.
* In '''2003''', California is the first state to ban MTBE. Several other states start switching soon afterward. California consumes {{convert|900|e6USgal|m3}} of ethanol a year, about a third of all the ethanol produced in the United States.
* In '''2004''', [[Crude oil]] prices rise by 80%. Gasoline prices rise 30% in the U.S. [[Diesel fuel]] rises almost 50%. These rises are caused by [[hurricane]] damage to oil rigs in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], attacks on [[Iraq]]i oil pipelines, disruptions elsewhere, and rising demand for gasoline in [[Asia]], as Asians buy more cars. Alcohol fuel prices are much closer to the price of gasoline. The ethanol industry in the USA makes {{convert|225000|oilbbl|m3}} per day in August, an all-time record. Some conventional oil fuel companies are investing in alcohol fuel. [[Oil reserves]] are forecast to last about 40 more years. Total use (demand) of ethanol is {{convert|3.53|e9USgal|m3}}.
* In '''2005''', E85 sells for 45 cents (or 30-75 cents wholesale) less than gasoline on average in the United States. More than 4 million [[flexible fuel|flexible-fuel]] (capable of running on E85 as well as gasoline) vehicles exist in the United States. About 400 filling stations exist in the US that sell E85 fuel, mostly in the Midwest. Gasoline prices rise as ethanol prices stay the same, due to rapidly growing ethanol supply and federal tax subsidies for ethanol. Wholesale ethanol prices drop nearly 30% between January and April, or $1.75 to $1.23 per gallon in the U.S.
* In '''2005''', the earliest-documented test of driving a car designed solely for gasoline use, long-distance solely on 100% [[butanol fuel]] occurs as American motorist David Ramey drove from [[Blacklick, Ohio]] to [[San Diego, California]] using 100% butanol in an unmodified 1992 [[Buick Park Avenue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2005/07/boosting_biomas.html |title=Boosting Biomass-to...Butanol? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=20 July 2005 |website= |publisher=Green Car Congress |access-date=2008-01-29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''2006''', the [[Indy Racing League]] switches to a 10% ethanol-90% methanol fuel mixture, as part of a phase-in to an all-ethanol formula in 2007. [[Bill Gates]] buys a quarter of [[Pacific Ethanol Inc.]] for $84 million.
* In '''2007''', [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] Special Rapporteur for the Right to Food urges five-year moratorium on food based biofuels, including ethanol, saying its development is a "crime against humanity." &lt;ref&gt;UN rapporteur calls for biofuel moratorium http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/UN_rapporteur_calls_for_biofuel_moratorium.html?cid=6189782&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) calls this "regrettable," and UN secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon, called for more scientific research. "Clearly biofuels have great potential for good and, perhaps, also for harm." &lt;ref&gt;UN head calls for more biofuels research http://www.scidev.net/en/climate-change-and-energy/news/un-head-calls-for-more-biofuels-research.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''2008''',  Bill Gates sells most Pacific shares held by [[Cascade Investment]] for a loss of $38.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;Gates $44 Million Loss on Ethanol Means More Profit for Valero https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a3qutgP_v5Ck&lt;/ref&gt;

He was considered the leading one among Trotskyist Soviet historians emerging after [[Perestroika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thatcher|first=Ian D.|title=Trotsky|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Vadim Rogovin died of [[cancer]], survived by his wife, Galina Valiuzhenich.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==''Was There An Alternative?''==

===Introduction===
In the introduction to the first volume of the  ''Was There An Alternative?'' series Rogovin explains his position and the purpose of this work as follows.&lt;ref&gt;''Note'' This section, unless otherwise referenced, is a summary of the introduction to the first volume of the series, ''Was There an Alternative? - Trotskyism: A Look Through the Years''&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[history of the Soviet Union]] a crucial question was to find out the reason for the emergence of the phenomenon of [[Stalinism]]. Rogovin writes there are basically two diametrically opposed approaches. The first one is that Stalinism with its terror was a logical, unavoidable evolution of [[Marxism-Leninism]] within [[Bolshevism]] from the Socialist revolution. Another approach is to consider that Stalinism was a historically accidental development and that there was an alternative  movement within Bolshevism (Trotskyism), and the major function of Stalinist terror was to suppress this movement.

Rogovin suggests that the first approach has become dominant in historical research for two major reasons. The first one is the coincidence of the goals in this respect of two major historical schools: of the official pro-Soviet school with the tradition of demonizing of Trotsky and Trotskyism and of the anti-Soviet, anti-Communist school, with its tradition of demonizing the whole [[Communist movement]], for which purpose it was convenient to attribute the traits of Stalinism to Communism as a whole. The second reason is that with a few exceptions of émigrés, all Trotskyists were physically eliminated by Stalin so that there are virtually no memoirs, and nearly all documents of the [[Left Opposition]] were made inaccessible. Therefore the historical picture has become distorted in this area for both subjective and objective reasons.

During [[Perestroika]] a large amount of memoirs of repressed people have become available.  Unfortunately the memoirs of "true"  Trotskyists (as opposed to the ones falsely accused of Trotskyism during Soviet repressions), are close to none, because all these real political opponents were physically eliminated. Fortunately the policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' had led to the opening of numerous archives, which make it possible  to better trace the evolution towards Stalinism.

Rogovin writes that the treatise did not consider the debunking of various misconceptions, in order not to unnecessarily disrupt the harmony of the exposition of the second alternative mentioned above: to demonstrate that Stalinism was not the only logical possibility of the evolution of the principles of Bolshevism.

With the above purpose in mind, the major focus of the treatise was necessarily Trotskyism and the Left Opposition movement within Bolshevism. This focus gave rise to accusations of bias. For example, historian [[Yuri Felshtinsky]] recognized the value of his work, while expressing an opinion that ''..Все эти книги, однако, проникнуты безудержной апологетикой Троцкого и проистекающим отсюда догматизмом'' ("All of these books, however, are imbued with rampant [[apologetics]] of Trotsky and with the dogmatism stemming from the former.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.felshtinsky.com/?p=195|title=Несколько слов о книгах Волкогонова Д., ответ читателю|author=Фельштинский Ю.|date=2010-08-30|publisher=felshtinsky.com|accessdate=2013-02-16|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EkfFNueq?url=http://www.felshtinsky.com/?p=195|archivedate=2013-02-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to such criticism Mikhail Voeikov, Doctor of Economic Sciences and a Professor of the Institute of Economics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, writes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/1999/05/rog-m15.html|title=Vadim Rogovin's contribution to Russian social sciences|author=Voeikov, Mikhail|date=1999-05-15|publisher=wsws.org|accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some opponents of Rogovin ascribe to him an apologetic attitude towards the person and the activity of Trotsky. Persons who are well acquainted with the whole world literature on this subject might agree with this impression. But for us, for the Russian readers who discovered the truth about Trotsky for the first time in the books of V.Z. Rogovin, no, we do not come away with an impression of apologetics. The very theme chosen by the author, "alternatives to Stalinism," by the nature of this genre presupposes the sort of tonality which is used by V.Z. Rogovin. However, even here one must bear in mind that in many cases Rogovin points out the miscalculations and errors of Trotsky. The book ''World Revolution and World War'' even contains a chapter entitled "In what and why did Trotsky err?" In general, however, Rogovin's books are not only about Trotsky. Behind some trees, even the very large ones, one must also see the forest.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Wagoto'''''|和事}}, or ''soft style'', is a style of [[kabuki]] acting that emphasizes realistic speech and gestures.  Wagoto actors typically do not employ the exaggerated makeup and costuming common to the more exaggerated ''[[aragoto]]'' (''rough'') style.

Wagoto was pioneered by [[Sakata Tōjūrō I]], an actor in the [[Kamigata]] ([[Osaka]]-[[Kyoto]]) region.  Plays that emphasize wagoto roles are typically tragic romances.  Famous plays that emphasize wagoto roles include ''[[Sonezaki Shinjū]]'' (''The Love Suicides at Sonezaki'') and ''[[Kuruwa Bunshō]]'' (''Tales of the Licensed Quarter'').

Wagotoshi refers to Kabuki actors who specialize in wagoto roles. Notable wagotoshi include [[Bandō Kakitsu I]] and [[Matsumoto Kōshirō VII]].

'''Władysław Konopczyński''' (26 November 1880 in [[Warsaw]] – 12 July 1952) was a leading Polish historian&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; and publisher of primary-source materials.&lt;ref name="PWN p. 539"&gt;''Encyklopedia powszechna PWN'', vol. 2, p. 539.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Władysław Konopczyński was born on 26 November 1880 in Warsaw as a son of Ignacy and Ludwika. He was baptised as Władysław Aleksander. His godsparents were Zofia Strumiłło and Aleksander Konopczyński.&lt;ref&gt;P. Biliński, Władysław Konopczyński w kręgu naukowym i rodzinnym. In: Władysław Konopczyński 1880–1952. Materiały z posiedzenia naukowego PAU w dniu 21 czerwca 2002 r., zebrał i opracował J. A. Gierowski, Kraków 2005, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Konopczyński was a student of Polish historian [[Szymon Askenazy]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;  He became a professor at [[Kraków]]'s [[Jagiellonian University]] (1917) and a member of the [[Warsaw Scientific Society]] (''Towarzystwo Naukowe Warszawskie'') and the [[Polish Academy of Learning]] (''Polska Akademia Umiejętności'', 1922).&lt;ref name="PWN p. 539"/&gt;

He was a polyglot who knew 14 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biliński|first1=Piotr|title=Władysław Konopczyński: historyk i polityk II Rzeczypospolitej (1880-1952)|date=1999|location=Warszawa|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Konopczyński's chief interests were Polish parliamentary history, 17th- and 18th-century Polish politics and political thought, and the [[Bar Confederation]]. He wrote histories of Poland and of the modern world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In his own time, he participated as a member of the Polish delegation at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Romer|first1=Eugeniusz|title=Pamiętnik Paryski 1918-1919.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a representative of [[Popular National Union]] in the Sejm between 1922 and 1927 during the [[Second Polish Republic]]. He argued for the recognition of the role of [[Roman Dmowski]] in the fight for Polish independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Konopczyński|first1=Władysław|title=O Miejscu dla Dmowskiego w Historii|url=http://www.romandmowski.pl/default.php?id=18&amp;dzial=odmowskim=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, he founded [[Polish Biographical Dictionary|''Polski słownik biograficzny'']] (The Polish Biographical Dictionary) and served as its first editor, seeing seven volumes through press, 1935–1949, before being forced by Poland's postwar communist government to resign his editorship.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PWN p. 539"/&gt; Many of his former and contemporary students also contributed to this work, including [[Emanuel Rostworowski]], [[Władysław Czapliński]], [[Józef Feldman]], and [[Józef Andrzej Gierowski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=(ed.) Prosińska-Jackl|first1=Maria|title=Słownik historyków polskich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Konoczyński survived German imprisonment at [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Released in February 1940, he returned to Kraków where he continued to teach history secretly, rebuking those who claimed that the circumstances of the war kept them from their studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rostworowski|first1=Emanuel|title=Afterward to "Fryderyk Wielki a Polska"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he was removed from all his academic and scholarly posts by Poland's communist government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Konopczyński was a recipient of the [[France|French]] ''[[Légion d'honneur]]''.
