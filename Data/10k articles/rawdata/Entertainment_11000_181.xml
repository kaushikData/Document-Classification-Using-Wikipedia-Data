'''''9/11''''' is a 2002 French-American [[documentary film]] about the [[September 11 attacks]] in [[New York City]], in which two planes were flown into the buildings of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]], resulting in their destruction and the deaths of more than 3,000 people.  The film is from the point of view of the [[New York City Fire Department]]. The film was directed by [[Jules and Gédéon Naudet]], and FDNY firefighter [[James Hanlon]],&lt;ref name=tulsaworld&gt;{{cite news|first=Rita|last=Sherrow|title=Documentary filmmakers captured moments of 9/11 tragedy |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/article.aspx?subjectid=275&amp;articleid=20110911_275_D3_CUTLIN943085 |work=[[Tulsa World]] |publisher= |date=2011-09-11|accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produced by [[Susan Zirinsky]] of CBS News.

==Plot==
[[File:WTM3 TEAM 21 0045.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Firehouse of FDNY Engine 7, Ladder 1, and Battalion 1]]
[[File:firstplane.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Jules Naudet]] captured [[American Airlines Flight 11]] striking the [[One World Trade Center|North Tower]].]]

Filmmakers James Hanlon and the Naudet brothers were given permission by [[New York City Fire Department]] to film a documentary about a [[probationary firefighter]]. Their subject was  Tony Benetatos, assigned to the Engine 7/Ladder 1/Battalion 1 Firehouse on Duane Street in Lower Manhattan. They intended to make a film about the "probie's" first experiences as a firefighter. On the morning of September 11, the firehouse, under the direction of Battalion Chief Joseph W. Pfeifer, was called out on a reported "odor of gas" at Church and Lispenard streets. Jules Naudet rode with Pfeifer to investigate, while Gédéon stayed behind at the firehouse to film the "probie."

As the Battalion 1 firefighters examined the supposed gas leak, [[American Airlines Flight 11]] flew overhead. Turning his camera to follow the plane, Jules Naudet taped one of only three known recordings of the first plane hitting the North Tower (Tower 1) of the World Trade Center in the [[9/11 attacks]]. The others were a video shot by [[Pavel Hlava]] and a sequence of still frames taken by [[Wolfgang Staehle]].

The firefighters under the direction of Chief Pfeifer were the first responders on the scene. Naudet was allowed to follow the chief during the attempted rescue operation. Naudet, Chief Pfeifer and several other FDNY chiefs were inside the lobby of Tower 1 when Tower 2 was hit by the second aircraft and when Tower 2 eventually collapsed. (Gédéon Naudet was still at the firehouse, where he filmed Benetatos and the rest of the firefighters from the next shift as they tried to deal with the disaster). The film gives various firemen's accounts of the events of the remainder of the day: from the initial crash to the building's collapse, to the attempts to rescue the few survivors from the rubble, as well as the aftermath of the events and acknowledging those who were lost, including Chief Pfeifer's brother, Engine 33 Lieutenant Kevin Pfeifer.

==Release and reception ==

CBS aired ''9/11'' commercial-free on March 10, 2002, to mark the six-month anniversary since the attacks. It was produced by [[Susan Zirinksy]]. The film was watched by 39.4 million viewers, bringing in a rating/share of 22.3/33, and was the highest-rated program that week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtango.com/listings?filters%5Bdate%5D%5Bmonth%5D=3&amp;filters%5Bdate%5D%5Bday%5D=10&amp;filters%5Bdate%5D%5Byear%5D=2002&amp;commit.x=18&amp;commit.y=21 |title=TV Listings for March 10, 2002 |publisher=TV Tango}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hosted by actor [[Robert De Niro]], CBS's broadcast was repeated on the first annual anniversary as well. The film aired in 103 countries in 2002 alone.&lt;ref name=tulsaworld/&gt; 

The film was noted for the subjects' use of [[profanity]]. Under regular circumstances on American broadcast media, this language would have been subject to [[censorship]] by the broadcaster or the [[Federal Communications Commission]]. At the time of the documentary's broadcast, the FCC took no action against the network for violating indecency rules, because it believed such action would have a negative connotation and would be interpreted as sanitizing history.

In addition, a recent ruling by a [[United States courts of appeals|federal appeals court]] had successfully granted a "temporary halt" to the FCC's enforcement of its indecency rules. This allowed CBS and any affiliates to air the documentary without edits and without fear of facing stiff fines.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2006-09-08/#7|title=CBS's 9/11 Documentary Gets All-Clear|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[DVD]] of the documentary was released in proximity, with De Niro's footage edited from it. CBS [[rerun|re-aired]] the film, hosted again by De Niro, on September 10, 2006, the night before the fifth anniversary of the attacks. This version contained updates from the principal subjects of the documentary,as of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312318/news|title=9/11 (2002) (TV) - News|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, September 11, 2011, [[CBS]] broadcast ''9/11: Ten Years Later,'' once again hosted by [[Robert De Niro]]. The aftershow was updated by the Naudet brothers, Hanlon and [[CBS News]] producer [[Susan Zirinsky]] to include new interviews and footage on the lives of those who had been shown in the documentary ten years later.&lt;ref name=nydailynews&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Huff|title=Former FDNY member James Hanlon recalls steps that brought him to '9/11: Ten Years Later' doc |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-09-01/entertainment/30117231_1_probie-fireman-fdny-james-hanlon |work=[[New York Daily News]] |publisher= |date=2011-09-01|accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program also focused on the construction of the new [[One World Trade Center]], and on the health problems faced by many of the firemen who had served at Ground Zero, where they were exposed to burning contaminants. DeNiro was joined by the Naudet brothers and James Hanlon, a former New York fireman-turned-film director who was also present that day. As with all previous broadcasts of the film, [[CBS]] aired repeated viewer discretion warnings before and during the broadcast.

On August 22, 2016, CNN picked up the rights to show the film for the 15th anniversary, this time hosted by [[Denis Leary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/08/cnn-films-picks-up-documentary-9-11-for-15th-anniversary-denis-leary-1201719101/|title=CNN Films Picks Up Documentary '9/11' for 15th Anniversary|first=Graham|last=Winfrey|date=22 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
''9/11'' was nominated for and won multiple awards, including an [[Emmy]] for Outstanding Non-Fiction Special (Informational) and a [[Peabody Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/9-11 62nd Annual Peabody Awards], May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312318/awards |title=9/11 (2002) (TV) - Awards |work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''African Aerospace and Defence Expo''' (AAD) is an aerospace and defence exhibition held every two years at [[AFB Waterkloof]], in [[Centurion, Gauteng]], [[South Africa]]. The exhibition combines a [[trade exhibition]] and an [[air show]]. 

The AAD began in 1975 when the South African based aviation magazine [[World Airnews]] determined that a professional aerospace exhibition was appropriate, as distinguished from the traveling "[[barnstorming]]" air shows that were then prominent.&lt;ref name="CAASA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Africa Aerospace and Defence |url=http://www.caasa.co.za/africa-aerospace-defence |website=Commercial Aviation Association of Southern Africa |accessdate=16 February 2018 |language=en-ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first event was held October 1975 as "Aviation Africa", at [[Lanseria Airport]] near [[Johannesburg]], South Africa under the sponsorship of the [[Commercial Aviation Association of Southern Africa]].&lt;ref name="Helfrich"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Helfrich |first1=Kim |title=The origins of AAD |url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=45052:the-origins-of-aad&amp;catid=7:Industry&amp;Itemid=116 |website=defenceWeb |accessdate=16 February 2018 |language=en-gb |date=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Lt. General [[Bob Rogers (SAAF officer)|Bob Rogers]] of the [[South African Air Force]] instituted an open day at [[AFB Waterkloof]], in Centurion, which eventually turned into the Defence Exhibition of South Africa (DEXSA).&lt;ref name="Helfrich"/&gt;

In 2000, Aviation Africa and DEXSA combined to become AAD.&lt;ref name="AADHistory"&gt;{{cite web |title=History - AAD 2018 |url=http://www.aadexpo.co.za/about-aad/history|website=African Aerospace and Defence |publisher=African Aerospace and Defence |accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the exhibition moved to [[AFB Ysterplaat]] in [[Cape Town]]. It returned to AFB Waterkloof in 2012.&lt;ref name="AADHistory"/&gt;

The next AAD is scheduled for 19-23 September 2018.&lt;ref name="AADAbout"&gt;{{cite web |title=AAD at a glance - AAD 2018 |url=http://www.aadexpo.co.za/about-aad |website=African Aerospace and Defence |publisher=African Aerospace and Defence |accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2348">'''Andrzej Leszczyc''' is a [[fictional character]] created and performed by [[Jerzy Skolimowski]]. He appears in three Skolimowski's early movies: ''[[Identification Marks: None]]'' (''Rysopis'', 1964), ''[[Walkover (film)|Walkover]]'' (''Walkower'', 1965) and ''[[Ręce do góry|Hands Up!]]'' (''Ręce do góry'', completed 1967, released 1981).

== Description ==
Andrzej Leszczyc is a young, about 26 years old, intelligent man, past [[ichthyology]] student. He is lost in his life. Iwona Grodź wrote in Skolimowski's biography that "uncertainty about Leszczyc's own plans denies his maturity. He doesn't know, what he wants to do in his life (...)”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Jerzy Skolimowski|last= Grodź|first= Iwona|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= „Więzi”|location= Warsaw|page= 58|pages= |url= |isbn= 978-83-60356-81-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leszczyc was sometimes described as Skolimowski's [[alter ego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wyborcza.pl/1,91947,5714819,Skolimowski__Nowa_Fala_nie_odplynela.html|title= Skolimowski: Nowa Fala nie odpłynęła|author= Darek Arest|date= 2008-09-20|language= Polish|publisher= „[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]”|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obieg.pl/teksty/2031 |title=Skolimowski, Królikiewicz, Żuławski, Uklański Czyli wypisy z historii polskiej nowej fali |author=Łukasz Ronduda |date=2007-11-01 |language=Polish |publisher=obieg.pl |accessdate=2 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422212645/http://www.obieg.pl/teksty/2031 |archivedate=22 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skolimowski about Leszczyc ==
Skolimowski said about the role: "Obviously, I didn't want to expose myself too much. (...) Leszczyc is a good mixture of fiction and reality. But he isn't me. Only to a certain degree”. The director also said, that he was improvising a lot playing Leszczyc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv7i1pvxmu4|title= Jerzy Skolimowski ogląda ''Rysopis''|author= |date= |language= Polish|publisher= Television [[Kino Polska]]|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Battletoads/Double Dragon''''' is a [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] [[beat 'em up]] developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and published by [[Tradewest]]. It was originally released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and later ported to the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], and [[Game Boy]].

''The Ultimate Team'' is a [[crossover fiction|crossover]] of both [[Technos Japan]]'s ''[[Double Dragon (series)|Double Dragon]]'' and Rare's own ''[[Battletoads]]'' game franchises, although Technos had little or no credited involvement in the production of the game outside of the ''Double Dragon'' license. The game features the characters from the ''Double Dragon'' series, Billy and Jimmy Lee, two young martial arts experts; also included are the three humanoid toad protagonists from the ''Battletoads'' game. It is also the first ''Battletoads'' game to feature all three toads as playable characters. The game's engine and design are directly based upon the ''Battletoads'' series.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Battletoads DD gameplay.gif|thumb|left|A gameplay 9 screenshot of the SNES version, showing the Battletoad Pimple fighting against the ''Double Dragon'' boss character Roper (Willy)]]

The player has a choice of five playable characters: Billy and Jimmy Lee from ''[[Double Dragon]]'', and Zitz, Pimple and Rash from ''[[Battletoads]]''. The player must then proceed through seven stages, kicking and punching each enemy that comes onscreen. A [[boss (video games)|boss]] is included at the end of each stage, challenging the player before they can progress to a higher [[level (video games)|level]] of the game.

With two players, the continues are overlapping: whenever one player continues, then both players have to start at the beginning of the level (this is the opposite of games like ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]'', where a strong player can tow a weak player along to advanced levels; in ''Battletoads Double Dragon'', a weak player will hold a strong player back).

==Plot==
After being defeated by the [[Battletoads (characters)|Battletoads]], the evil [[Dark Queen (Battletoads)|Dark Queen]] flees to the outer reaches of the universe and the 'Toads and their mentor get on with their lives. However, one day the Earth's military is neutralized and a giant spaceship called ''Colossus'' emerges from the moon. Apparently, the Dark Queen is back with another plan to dominate the galaxy, and she has allied herself with the Shadow Warriors (from the ''Double Dragon'' series) to supplement her forces. Deciding to even the odds, the Battletoads get in contact with Billy and Jimmy Lee and ask them for their help. The brothers agree, and all five immediately take off for the Colossus in a mission to stop this two-pronged threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/nes/manuals/manuals/battletoads_double_dragon.txt |title='&amp;#39;Battletoads Double Dragon'&amp;#39; instruction manual |publisher=Gamersgraveyard.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The initial NES version of the game features 3D scrolling and other advanced special effects not commonly found on the console. The Game Boy version is similar to the NES version, but it is only for one player. The sprites are the same size although the screen is smaller (leaving less room for movement) and the 3D effects were removed.

The later Genesis and Super NES versions of the game are quite similar, the only differences being the SNES version has better graphics and higher quality sound, while the Sega version runs more smoothly, features more music tracks, has sharper sprites for the 'toads, and more comical reactions from the characters and from defeated enemies, as well as blood from said enemies' post-defeat portraits.

==Reception==

'''''Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten''''' is the sequel to the ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine|Season Nine]]'' comic book series, a [[Buffyverse canon|canonical]] continuation of the television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. The series is published by [[Dark Horse Comics]] and ran from March 2014 to August 2016.&lt;ref name="CBR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=48352 |title=NYCC Exclusive: Dark Horse Comics Unveils "Serenity" and "Buffy: Season 10" |author=Glendening, Daniel |date=October 11, 2013 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Season Ten'' brand continues the two ongoing component series that formed ''Season Nine'': ''Buffy'' and ''Angel &amp; Faith''. The creative team of ''Angel &amp; Faith'' in ''Season Nine'', writer [[Christos Gage]] and penciler [[Rebekah Isaacs]], are the creative team behind ''Buffy Season Ten''. [[Victor Gischler]] and [[Will Conrad]] took over ''Angel &amp; Faith'' in this season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/10/10/buffy-2/ |title=Buffy Season Ten, And A Relaunched Angel &amp; Faith, Together |author=Johnston, Rich |date=October 10, 2013 |website=[[Bleeding Cool]] |accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with ''Season Nine'', there were no spin-off series in addition to the two core series. There was however a short story titled "Where Are They Now", published in Dark Horse Day Sampler 2016.

The series was followed by ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eleven|Season Eleven]]'' which began November 23, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-will-travel-to-san-francisco-for-dark-horse-comics-season-11/|access-date=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
As in the preparation for the previous season, there was a writer's summit in spring 2013, months before ''Season Nine'' ended. Along with all the creators from ''Season Nine'', [[Victor Gischler]] and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' actor [[Nicholas Brendon]] joined the team.&lt;ref name=CBR /&gt;

==Plot==
{{Plot|section|date=August 2016}}
===''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''===
[[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] and [[Scooby Gang|her friends]] must quickly get to grips with the new rules of magic created at the end of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine|Season Nine]]'' when they encounter a new breed of vampires which can shapeshift, walk in sunlight, and which is generally harder to kill. Another consequence is that Buffy's sister [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]], though alive again thanks to the recreation of magic, has had a traumatic time adjusting to life; she feels her mother's death as if the event was recent, and her feelings for her boyfriend [[Xander Harris|Xander]] have reset as well. Meanwhile, Xander is secretly haunted by apparitions of his dead ex-fiance [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]]; he does not know if she is real or a hallucination. However, all is not bleak, as Buffy's old mentor [[Rupert Giles|Giles]] is delivered to her by [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] alive and mentally intact, but in the body of a child, following the events of ''Angel &amp; Faith'' in the previous season. The group soon learn that the now-blank ''Vampyr'' book given to Buffy back in 1997 can be used to write new rules for magic, and quickly realizing what a danger this book is, the gang forms an alliance with the demon [[D'Hoffryn]] and other interested parties to keep the book safe and act as stewards over the new and unstable rules of magic. They consider the needs of various mystical groups willing to make peace with humans including a mutually non-lethal agreement with the majority of the world's vampires, led by [[Harmony Kendall]].

The gang does some growing up. [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] prevents [[Andrew Wells|Andrew]] from making a terrible mistake with the ''Vampyr'' book when he attempts to resurrect her long-dead girlfriend [[Tara Maclay|Tara]], whose death he feels responsible for, and confronts his tendency to act impulsively &amp;ndash; sometimes with good motivations &amp;ndash; but without regard for other people's consent or feelings. He does however activate a digital recording of the personality of his friend and victim [[Jonathan Levinson]]. Some time later, after some soul searching, Andrew realizes he is [[homosexuality|gay]]. Meanwhile, Willow, ends her relationship with the demon witch [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#S|Aluwyn]], having grown apart, and Xander and Dawn decide to take things slow. Buffy and [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] confront the fact that they've grown closer to each other, and Buffy realizes she loves Spike, and they become a couple. Buffy stands by Spike when it appears that an evil outside force is controlling him at night, and they soon track this force down: an ancient vampire named Archaeus who is part of the same lineage as Spike and [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]], Archaeus having directly sired [[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|the Master]]. Temporarily getting away from the powerful demon, the group realize they will have to bring Angel in on the development. Buffy is able to put the events of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight|Season Eight]]'', in which Angel was influenced by a higher power into being a villain, behind her, but there is initial awkwardness in the group as they attempt to confront Archaeus. However, working together, Buffy, Angel and Spike are able to wound Archaeus and kill his servants with the Scythe, so Archaeus flees. D'Hoffryn informs Buffy that a portal Archaeus was using, which opens into hell dimensions, is called the Restless Door and is being repaired by an alliance of enemies faced by the gang this season: the Old One, the Soul Glutton; the siren, Mistress; and the flesh demon, the Sculptor, who wish to overrun Earth with demons. Angel leaves to warn his friends in London, giving Spike his blessing and accepting a place as a friend in Buffy's life, but confides in Willow that he believes Spike's self-destructiveness will doom his relationship with Buffy.

When Buffy's father Hank announces he doesn't want Buffy to be a part of his wedding due to her being a Slayer, she finds herself surprisingly hurt by this. On a different mission, a demon triggers Buffy's memories of [[Seeing Red (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|her attempted rape by a soulless Spike]]. She explains to Spike that she doesn't blame him for his actions when he didn't have a soul, but that she will always remember them, and that he has to respect that she will always have to deal with them in her own way. Meanwhile, Anya's ghost transpires to be the puppet of an unseen force and completely unaware that she is not Anya; it is exploiting Xander as a weak link in Buffy's circle. Later, demon invasions caused by the Restless Door become a global threat. The Slayer Satsu, who once had a fling with Buffy, attempts to convince Buffy that she needs to work with the military as they are the only ones with the resources to help and since she forgave Angel, the military also deserves another chance. The military needs Buffy and Spike to recruit both types of vampires to help battle the demon invasions. The vampires are represented by Harmony and Vicki who have Buffy and Spike win trials of combat to gain the vampires alliance. The two vampire leaders also point out the insecurities in Buffy's and Spike's relationship. Spike later meets with a woman from his past, Dylan, first seen in the ''Spike: Into the Light'' (2014) comic. Dylan thanks Spike for giving her the courage to grow as a person and wants a friendship with both him and Buffy. Meanwhile, Buffy is outraged at Willow's eagerness to work for the military, helping them understand magic. Willow believes this is right and has an attraction to Lake Stevens, a woman who leads the military's supernatural unit. Willow and Buffy acknowledge they are changing but agree to not let this disagreement divide them. 

To help battle the invasions Buffy reluctantly agrees to use the ''Vampyr'' book to increase the powers of D'Hoffryn's Demon Council with the limit that the powers are for the one in office, not the demon themselves. Giles grows close to the [[faeries|Fae folk]] who accept him in both mind and body, though his favoritism of them leads to some tension with Buffy.  The Sculptor offers to make Andrew a human body for Jonathan's digital personality if Andrew steals the Scythe. Andrew tricks the Sculptor into thinking he complied but he actually told Buffy beforehand and she kills the Sculptor. Realising his new body will disintegrate, Jonathan runs off, furious at Andrew betraying him again. Though Andrew is hurt, he has stopped living out his fantasies and is ready to face the real world with the Scoobies. Xander admits to Ghost Anya he knows she isn't actually Anya and decides to ignore her. The Scoobies find and overwhelm the Siren Mistress and Soul Glutton, to escape, the two destroy the Restless Door; creating an unstable portal that will consume Earth unless Dawn as The Key can close it. Being in a magical dimension gives Dawn great power but she can only close the portal from the demon's side and will be stuck there if she does. To save Earth she agrees and convinces the others this is the right choice and they promise to find another way to bring her home. Xander stays with Dawn, leaving Ghost Anya alone and vengeful on Earth. As the Scoobies leave, Buffy wishes D'Hoffryn's Council could just kill the Soul Glutton and Siren Mistress without their help. Ghost Anya secretly grants this wish. After killing the two, D'Hoffryn tells Ghost Anya she was a copy he made and now that she has activated her vengeance powers she becomes corporeal. D'Hoffryn is now ready to take the ''Vampyr'' book to give himself power.

While the Scoobies are desperate to reach Dawn and Xander in the hell dimension Anharra, D'Hoffryn kills all the other members of the Magic Council and takes their expanded abilities. The Scoobies are powerless to stop him from taking the book. Meanwhile, Xander and Dawn make the demons of the dimension more civilised but attract the attention of [[Wolfram &amp; Hart]], which has an office there. They reject an offer from W&amp;H lawyer [[Lilah Morgan]] to help them find a route home, as that would allow the Senior Partners to return as well. Lilah instead tracks Xander and Dawn as they make their own way home through the multiverse. After D'Hoffryn effortlessly backfires the military's own missiles on them, the military dismisses Willow for the Scoobies' lack of judgement, which leads Willow and Lake to break up. Jonathan returns, tormenting Andrew in an attempt to break up the Scoobies, after he is offered a living body and a life as a vengeance demon by D'Hoffryn. Jonathan shakes Andrew by showing him what his friends really think of him, allowing Jonathan to become the first male vengeance demon, but Andrew realises these comments were taken out of context, and returns to the Scoobies with high-tech weaponry to help fight D'Hoffryn. Giles is disgusted the Fae and the rest of the magical community have agreed to terms with D'Hoffryn, believing him too powerful to fight. Buffy's increasingly aggressive tactics over the book and finding Xander and Dawn put a strain between her and all the Scoobies leading Spike to want to break up with her. Buffy refuses saying their relationship is worth fighting for even if they both have doubts and Spike agrees. Buffy has an idea to stop D'Hoffryn that requires their allies to do nothing. As the Scoobies come together, Dawn and Xander return just in time to join the battle. D'Hoffryn's alterations to the book are rejected as Buffy's plan was to make the magical community believe he would fail; the book only allows rules that the majority of people believe in and will follow. D'Hoffryn broadcasts his battle with the Scoobies to everyone so they will believe he is unstoppable, bringing the Anya copy and Jonathan with him. The Scoobies are quickly overwhelmed while D'Hoffryn claims this is vengeance for taking Anya from him. However, Anya betrays D'Hoffryn and grants Buffy's wish to remove D'Hoffryn's expanded abilities. After D'Hoffryn fatally burns her, the other vengeance demons reject him, and the Scoobies pursue him back to his homeworld, Arashmahar, and kill him, having given Dawn the ability to open portals. Weeks later, the Scoobies decide to own the responsibility of the book, putting Buffy, Willow and Giles on the newest Magical Council, which also includes Dracula, Riley, and other demons, while Lilah and a new cadre of demonic lobbyists and journalists appeal to the Council members for favours. Buffy is excited and nervous about her new responsibilities, but accepts it as part of life. 

''Where are They Now?'' is a brief story released in a free sampler celebrating Dark Horse's 30th anniversary. Harmony, Clem, and a two-person film crew of a vampire and human are filming Harmony's documentary of how the world has changed now that the supernatural is known. She annoys Buffy over three days, calling her a relic that is no longer special since she broke the rules to give all the Slayers power, but also warns her that someone is apparently trying to kill her. Buffy is electrocuted by wires left in water in the laundry room. Harmony interrupts Buffy and Spike's date night, implying they have relationship problems, and the three of them stop an out-of-control streetcar from hurting anyone. On the third night she walks in on Buffy and Giles looking over old spell-books, and Giles remembers the human from the film crew as a former Watcher-in-training, deducing that he and the vampire cameraman are trying to kill Buffy, tired of her messing with primordial forces. Buffy slays the vampire, and the would-be Watcher is turned over to the police. Harmony believes that if a Watcher and vampire hate Buffy enough to work together, she should realise that rules exist for a reason, and that if she keeps breaking them she might break everything. Buffy ignores this, and Harmony is unsure if that makes her the best Slayer ever, or the worst.

===''Angel &amp; Faith''===
Angel begins as the self-appointed guardian over London's new Magic Town ghetto created by events of ''Angel &amp; Faith'' in the previous season, while Faith is on a journey to find herself, initially in the United States. Many of the town's residents have mutated into magical creatures, and Angel is forced to adjust to this new status quo, making an ally in London police officer Detective Brandt and relying on previous local friends Alasdair Coames and the Fairweather sisters Lavinia and Sophronia. He learns that the aggressive Slayer Nadira has survived her injuries at the conclusion of ''Season Nine'' and mutated into a benevolent seer who can commune with the unique magic of Magic Town, which she says is sentient. Angel is initially frustrated by the half-demon Pearl from ''Season Nine'' and a plot run by mutated magical pixies that leads him to the witch [[Amy Madison]]. Amy is vengeful for the events of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight|Season Eight]]'', and has gained great power from Magic Town's energy intending to kill Willow. However, Nadira easily overpowers Amy. Soon after, Angel is stunned to find his deceased friend [[Winifred Burkle|Fred Burkle]] walking the streets &amp;ndash; alive following the events of ''Buffy'' in ''Season Nine'', when  [[Illyria (Angel)|Illyria]], the demon wearing Fred's former body, appeared to die during the event which restored magic to the world.

Meanwhile, Faith begins working for [[Kennedy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kennedy]]'s Slayer bodyguard corporation but doesn't fit in and prepares to quit until she learns Buffy's ex [[Riley Finn]] has gone missing in South America. Faith rescues him and his wife Samantha from tribal vampires and Riley forgives her for the events of the ''Buffy'' episode "[[Who Are You (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Who Are You]]", where she slept with Riley while leading him to believe she was Buffy. Faith is then recruited by Kennedy's client, pharmaceuticals owner Reese Zane, to come to Magic Town to help her study the magic there; she appoints Faith her head of security. Angel learns following the creation of the new Seed of Wonder, responsible for all magic in the universe, in ''Buffy'', that Fred's essence was brought back when Illyria's body reconstituted. However, both entities are capable of surfacing and taking control of her body. Divorced again from her human traits, Illyria is convinced that Angel and the others want to destroy her to save Fred. Eldre Koh, a contemporary of Illyria from last season's ''Buffy'' title shows up to learn from Illyria who had him falsely imprisoned for killing his own family, only to discover it was Illyria herself. With coaxing from Nadira, Koh is able to give up his need for vengeance. After Illyria goes on a rampage, Fred is able to reassert control and contain Illyria inside her. Illyria and Fred fascinate Reese, who discloses her intent to research them further.

While Angel is away, Faith and Fred are called by Detective Brandt to look into a recent trend of murders caused by vampires in the London area. Realizing the connection to the deaths in Angel's dreams and a local Prep School, Faith &amp; Fred go undercover as the gym teacher and lunch lady respectively. Faith notices a girl named Mary being bullied by her classmates. The bullies are all new vampires that have been ordered to convince their classmates to want to become vampires. Faith &amp; Fred slay the bullies. Mary discovers the vampires want her to join them, while they are led by [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]]. Archaeus has recruited Drusilla to sire the students and wants Mary sired for a special reason. Faith, Fred and Koh save Mary while dusting the vampire students, though Drusilla escapes. Faith and Fred decide to wait for Angel to return to figure out their next move, while Mary visits her father who is researching an ancient statue. Angel's return causes Drusilla's vampires to wreak havoc on Magic Town while they capture Nadira. Archaeus explains he can offer the energy of Magic Town a gift and wants Nadira to be his ambassador to the energy, intending to take over Magic Town with his vampire forces. Nadira warns him the energy of Magic Town will lash out at him like a bomb and unsuccessfully tries to fight her way out. Nadira is locked up as Drusilla has a plan to get the statute and Angel's team is on Archaeus' trail. With the statue on its way to Archaeus, Detective Brandt gives Angel a tip on his whereabouts, though nobody realizes Brandt is now a vampire. Archaeus and Drusilla try and talk Angel into coming "home" to them, but Archaeus' attempt to control Angel seems to awake Angelus. Archaeus sends Drusilla and some of his vampires to eliminate Faith and her team while taking Angelus to Nadira. Nadira claims she is worried The Magic may decide to side with Archaeus. Angel reveals he was putting on an act, allowing everyone to escape with Nadira. Archaeus has the statue unloaded in the middle of Magic Town. The sentient magic merges with it to give itself physical form and lashes out at any who approach. Angel confronts Brandt and Faith dusts the Detective. Nadira tries to calm The Magic down, saying she knows it wants to be like a real person, but it attacks Fred which summons an angry Illyria. Koh is able to convince Illyria they do not need to fight each other and forgives her for what she did to him, letting Fred return to the body. Nadira is able to get The Magic to stop fighting, but Archaeus shows up and offers it a place at his side as an equal. When Angel and everyone attack him, Archaeus claims it's proof that they only know violence and they would never treat The Magic fairly. Drusilla and hundreds of vampires reveal themselves as Archaeus's "family." The citizens and mutants of Magic Town rush to Angel &amp; Faith's aid out of respect for all the help they've given them. The vampires are overwhelmed and many including Drusilla flee. Even alone, Archaeus proves powerful, and attacks Nadira. The Magic defends her by vacating the statue and locking Archaeus inside. Afterwards Nadira says she can sense it has gone somewhere quiet to think. The team toast their victory in protecting their new home of Magic Town.

'''Bushbuck Charms, Viking Ships &amp; Dodo Eggs''', also known as '''Bush Buck: Global Treasure Hunter''', is an [[educational software|educational]] [[computer game]] released in 1991.  Designed by the [[Australia]]n company [[Reckon]], the game was published by "PC Globe", a small [[United States|US]]-based company that specialized in "[[edutainment]]" software in the late 1980s and early 90s.  In the tradition of [[Brøderbund]]'s [[Carmen Sandiego]] games, "[[Bushbuck]] Charms, [[Viking]] Ships and [[Dodo]] Eggs" taught [[geography]] through a storyline that involved a global scavenger hunt for unusual items.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lewis|first=Peter H.|contribution=Global Treasure Hunt|format=Personal Computers column|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/07/science/personal-computers-global-treasure-hunt.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=1 January 2012|title=The New York Times|date=7 May 1991|mode=cs1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each game, the player had to find fifteen items which the game chose from a selection of hundreds of possible items.&lt;ref name="Farisian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bushbuck Charms, Viking Ships &amp; Dodo Eggs: FAQ/Strategy Guide|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/995661-bushbuck-charms-viking-ships-and-dodo-eggs/faqs/59714|work=GameFAQs.com|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|accessdate=1 January 2012|author=Dean "muntumbomoklik" Farisian|date=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few of the possible items were a [[Conium|hemlock]] leaf, a [[lava-lava]], and an [[alpaca]] [[poncho]].&lt;ref name="Farisian" /&gt;  The game ran on the [[Amiga]] and [[MS-DOS]] platforms.

==Gameplay==
The game is played by flying from city to city seeking treasures as laid out at the beginning of the round. The game has three possible modes, one player with no computer player (not available in advanced skill), one player with computer player, and two player.

The game starts in a randomly selected city which becomes the home base for that round's competition, to which the player must return to redeem treasures for points and additional tickets. If the player collects all available items, a one way flight back to the home base city is rewarded. Five items are made available at any one time with a total of fifteen items available for the entire round.

===In-Game Menu===
Eight different buttons are available on screen at all times, as well as the exit button and the indicator (thermometer in beginner and eye in intermediate and advanced).

''City On/Off Toggle''

Allows the player to choose whether or not to have the cities show on the map.  Does not affect cities with clues.

''? Toggle''

When lit up, give player hints during play. If clicked, will pull up a red screen explaining the in-game menu options.

''Pointer Mode Toggle''

Gives the player control of a pointer which will, when placed over a city, indicates the city name.

''Key Toggle''

When clicked, brings up a legend to indicate what on the map is what.

''Magnifying Glass Toggle'

Allows the player to choose between a close up view of the region he/she is currently in, or a full world map view. When lit up, indicates that zoomed in mode is in use, when dark, indicates world map mode is in use.

''Music Note Toggle''

Switches music on/off.

''Airplane Toggle''

Puts player in flight mode, allowing the player to choose which of the available cities he/she would like to fly to.

''Item Toggle''

Opens the item menu, allowing the player to see what items are on board, what items are available, and allows the player to view any collected clues.

===Weather===
Different weather-related obstacles are presented while heading from city to city. At times the player may have to choose to either fly through a [[blizzard]], [[typhoon]], [[hail]]storm, [[rain storm]], [[hurricane]], or pick another city than the one intended. If the player chooses to go through the storm, they may make it, or they may be redirected back to the original city. If there are any items on board when flying through inclement weather, they will be roughed up, and be worth less points when turned in.

===Tickets===
The player starts with a set number of tickets at the beginning of the round (60 in beginner, 50 in intermediate, 40 in advanced).  One ticket is used per flight, and if a player chooses to fly through a storm and does not make it to the desired destination, between one and three tickets need to be cashed in to pay for damages to the plane. When the player returns items to the home base, 10 additional tickets are given per item returned.

===Infoboxes===
Each city has an "infobox" which pops up either when the player flies into the city, or when the player clicks on the city in the pointer mode. The infoboxes contain varied interesting information about the city, from famous people from there to who founded it, and have an underlined feature such as a monument or attraction present in that city.

===Clues===
Clues are available at certain cities as indicated by a little black box on the map. Five clues are available for each item, and the clues get progressively more helpful as the player finds them. City features, historical facts, and pop culture references, as well as infobox information is used.

===Skill Levels===
The game has three levels of skill: Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.

As a "Beginner" the player faces a stereotyped [[France|French]] person called Pierre. On Beginner, there is a gauge on the left on the screen that shows how close the player is to an item. So in theory, the player could follow the gauge until, by a process of elimination, the item is found. The European version of the game features instead a typical Texan person that goes by the name of John.

On the "Intermediate" level the player faces a stereotyped [[Russia]]n person called Natasha. On Intermediate, the gauge is removed and is replaced by a button with an [[human eye|eye]] on it. When the player is in the right city, the eye lights up, which when pressed gives the item over to the player.

When playing on "Advanced" the player faces a [[Germany|German]] [[aristocracy|aristocrat]] called Otto. On Advanced, the eye remains, but the lighting up feature is removed so the city which the item is in must be pinpointed exactly to reveal the item in question.
Otto occasionally flies long distance flights that the player cannot. He sends the player to the wrong country, not the city the player clicked. If the player happens to be in the same city as Otto when an item is found, Otto will take it. Also, if the player flies to a country Otto has visited, a picture of Otto appears above the infobox with a speech bubble saying "Otto vaz ere!"

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' called the graphics and audio mediocre, but recommended the game to children and adults interested in geography and maps.&lt;ref name="muldawer199111"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&amp;pub=2&amp;id=88 | title=In Search Of... | work=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1991 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Muldawer, Deborah | pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cabals: Magic &amp; Battle Cards''''' is a [[digital collectible card game]] designed by Mika Rosendahl and developed by Finnish studio Kyy Games. The game combines a [[game board]] mechanic and [[cross-platform]] online [[multiplayer]] gameplay. Cabals: The Card Game was published on November 30, 2011&lt;ref name="Cabals: The Card Game Released!"/&gt; for [[iPhone]], [[iPad]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices and [[Internet]] [[Web browser|Browsers]]. The newly named Cabals: Magic &amp; Battles cards was released on April 11, 2014&lt;ref name=cabalsgame.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Cabals: Magic &amp; Battle Cards|url=http://cabalsgame.com/news.php?news=71|publisher=Kyy Games|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cabals: Magic &amp; Battle Cards, two players struggle for dominance by playing and moving cards on a [[game board]]. Both players use their own [[deck of cards]] that gives them a selection of unique units and abilities. Two different ways to win makes sure that there are countless different ways to try and overcome the opponent. The board introduces a completely new tactical aspect to trading card games. It makes clever positioning a big part of the game, and changes shape from match to match, inviting the players to alter their approach depending on the environment. The board also keeps the gameplay intuitive, making Cabals: The Card Game very approachable.

On May 14, 2015&lt;ref name=kickstarter.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Cabals: The Board Game|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kyygames/cabals-the-board-game/|publisher=Kyy Games|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a crowdfunding project was launched by [[Kyy Games]] to fund a tabletop adaptation of the digital game.

==Setting==
The world of Cabals: Magic &amp; Battle Cards is inspired by various real [[mystical]] and [[esoteric]] traditions. It has been developed specifically for Cabals: Magic &amp; Battle Cards with the help of an award-winning author [[Johanna Sinisalo]], and brought to life by original paintings for each individual card.

Set in [[Europe]] between the two [[world wars]], Cabals: Magic &amp; Battle Cards takes the players in the middle of a different kind of struggle, one fought in shadows. It's a war between [[cabals]], secret societies dedicated to harnessing the forbidden powers to their own ends. It's a war over influence and a chance to shape the future of humankind.

The power struggle is between six cabals:
:* ''[[Danann Covenant]]'' are a group of jazz-age [[witches]] who have summoned the forgotten [[Sidhe]] to their side
:* ''[[Bearclaw Brotherhood]]'' is built upon the powers of the [[shamans]] and the command they have over the [[Earth|land]], [[spirits]] and the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] people
:* ''[[Vril Society]]'' combines strange [[Vril]] energy to the latest [[technological]] discoveries for powerful and unusual results
:* ''[[Order of Zahir]]'' relies on the [[esoteric]] art of [[alchemy]], and are masters over both mind and matter
:* ''[[Sons of Osiris]]'' acolytes and necromancers from [[Egypt]], relying on the art of necromancy and priesthood
:* ''[[Dragon Enclave]]'' [[shaolin monks]] built upon fundamental taoism, along with the summoning of number of powerful, ancient legendary dragons on their side

==Gameplay==
Gameplay takes place between two players - either against an [[AI]] [[wikt:adversary|opponent]] in single player, or another person in online multiplayer. Matches are played on a random game board with each player using their own pre-constructed deck of cards. A typical game board will have two stronghold locations, several resource locations, and in some cases additional deployment locations. The objective of the game is to win either by capturing your opponent's stronghold, or collecting 60 Domination points (the game's internal scoring mechanic for controlling locations). Each player has a special [[Hero]] unit with a once-per-game ability and plays their turn by commanding unit cards and casting action cards.

Players must manage their resources to play cards.  Each card has a base cost and a loyalty cost – a base cost is the minimum that a card will cost the player (in resources) and the loyalty cost is a bonus that is reduced if other cards from the same suit are already in play.

Units (cards that can be placed on the board) can only be placed on a deployment location controlled by that player. Most unit cards have a single move per turn - and some units have special abilities that can usually only be cast once per turn. This creates a game play mechanic for the player where they must carefully manage not only the cards in their hand, but also the movement of their units on the game board while defending against the movements of their opponent.

Actions (cards that can be played directly from the hand) usually indicate a target, or sometimes have a global effect that affects all cards on the board.

Combat takes place when two units try to occupy the same position on the game board. A unit has a power number that determines how much damage it can deal and absorb. When a unit receives more damage than its power number, it is destroyed. Some units are given special abilities that modify their power.

===Deck Construction===
Constructing a card deck is a major part of gameplay in Cabals: Magic &amp; Battle Cards. A deck may contain any number of cards, but must maintain a minimum of 30 cards.  There is a limit of three repeat cards per deck.  Each deck contains a special Hero unit which has a powerful once-per-game ability.  Cards that can be placed into a deck are limited by the special Hero unit that is chosen - meaning that some cards are available only to certain heroes, while other cards are prohibited.

==Reception==
[[Cassandra Khaw]] of [[TouchArcade]] gave ''Cabals: The Card Game'' a review of 4/5 stars, stating "Cabals is easy to grasp and surprisingly deep for something that can, at times, feel like a distilled version of the genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toucharcade.com/2011/12/12/cabals-the-card-game-review/|title='Cabals: The Card Game' Review - Urban Fantasy Card Game with Victorian Influences?

[[Adam Smith]] of [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] gave ''Cabals: The Card Game'' a generally positive review (no ranking),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/11/25/occult-dealings-cabals-the-card-game/|title=Occult Dealings: Cabals – The Card Game|author=Adam Smith|publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|date= |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating "I do like the art style [though] and for some reason the use of a board makes this somehow more gripping. I reckon I’m either going to be addicted to it by the end of the month or I’ll have all but forgotten it exists."

[[Brad Cummings]] of [[BoardGameGeek]] gave ''Cabals: The Card Game'' a review of 4/5 stars,  stating "The cross-platform features generally work well and it offers a lot of content at a low entry fee. The tactical play is a great direction to take deck building and makes the game about more than chaining combos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/6631/ios-review-cabals-the-card-game|title=iOS Review: Cabals: The Card Game|author=Brad Cummings|publisher=BoardGameGeek|date= |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cinema in Iquitos had no established date of origin.  The first film, however, was made in 1900. The first films were shown in the [[Casa de Fierro]] with an [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] machine, which reproduced the images using a [[carbide lamp]] and the constant movement of the operator. Iquitos is mentioned as a [[metonym]] of cinema in the [[Peruvian Amazon]].

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Iquitos Casa de Hierro01.jpg|thumb|left|150px|In the Iron House, the first film projection was presented with an [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] machine in 1900.]]
Until around the 1880, Iquitos did not have a [[film set]]. Interest in [[film production]] grew alongside [[World cinema|the film industry booming elsewhere in the world]]. There is not enough accurate visual record the exact birth of cinema in Iquitos.&lt;ref name="Joaquín García" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Francisco Bardales 2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bardales|first=Francisco|title=Cronológica historia del cine en Iquitos|url=http://pakobardales.blogspot.com/2007/02/cronologa-histrica-del-cine-en-iquitos.html|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Les Langues Néo-Latines"&gt;{{cite book|last=García Sánchez|first=Joaquín|title=Les Langues Néo-Latines|year=2006|publisher=Société des Langues Néo-Latines|location=Association des Enseignants de sLangues Vivantes Romanes|pages=32–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, following the rhythm of the European organization of the city, scientific technology began arriving.

The first film made in 1900 was recorded{{clarify|The first theater showing or the first film production?|date=July 2012}}. A movie was projected for the first time in the Iron House with an Edison machine, which reproduced the images using a carbide lamp and the constant movement of an operator. Before the fact, in 1898, Clement Alcala and Francisco de Paula Secada obtained land on the north side of the Plaza de Armas, and built a rustic-roof building, naming it Alhambra. They installed a tiny carousel brought from [[Manaus]], Brazil. In 1902, with the rubber boom and its international impact, Edward Fuller purchased Alhambra. It hence became the first movie theater in town with Lumière brand projectors.

In the continuous city growth following the success of the rubber extraction, and its connection with Europe, the [[bourgeoisie]] grew in the city. Arnaldo Reategui traveled to [[France]] in 1905, and bought a projector with a large collection of movies&amp;mdash;in [[black-and-white]] and [[technicolor]]&amp;mdash;from cinema house [[Pathé Freres]] and [[Léon Gaumont]]. He was affiliated with Luis Pinasco and built a cinema called Jardín Strassburgo, located on the first block of Sargento Lores street.&lt;ref name="Joaquín García" /&gt;  The first stage of Iquitos film concluded in 1914, with a prominent presence of French filmmakers. [[Georges Méliès]] and Gaumont sent several films on celluloid for the aristocratic film billboard of Iquitos. The film making attracted audiences, and blockbusters were reaching £4,500.&lt;ref name="Joaquín García" /&gt;

===Rubber crisis and the prominence of Antonio Wong===

Although the crisis hit Iquitos and had its effect on the industry, the arrival of new films did not stop. Films with a theatrical demeanor were gradually replaced by those more directed towards fiction. The filmmaking attracted new aspirations and acting talents, and the [[Star system (filmmaking)|star system]] was present in the market.&lt;ref name="Joaquín García" /&gt;  The distribution of [[Charlie Chaplin]] silent films were introduced by the Spanish businessman Jose Altimira.

The most important pioneer of cinema in Iquitos and the [[Loreto Region]] in general was {{Interlanguage link multi|Antonio Wong Rengifo|es}}, also a pioneer of film art in Peru. It is mainly known for shaping their ideologies, aspirations and other thoughts in his films.{{clarify|date=July 2012}} Wong Rengifo, in the course of his film making, followed the changing technology in the United States. In 1936, he premiered his film ''Bajo el sol de Loreto'', a film which examines the main economic engine, and the valuation of the [[Peruvian Amazon]] (called "Selvak" in the film). He is thought to give an active representation of the amazonian culture in his films.&lt;ref name="Joaquín García" /&gt;  Wong worked as a [[cameraman]], [[Photographic developer|developed]] his own films and [[film editor|edited]] them, and wrote his scripts inspired by Iquitos culture.

===Developments to date===
In October 1957, Wong started the production of a film, with Mexican actress [[Amalia Aguilar]], to be shown at the First International Fair of Iquitos. Due to a fire, however, his film study was consumed by fire and never made it to cinemas.&lt;ref name="Francisco Bardales 2" /&gt; The same year, a group of filmmakers came from Hollywood, accompanied by Harma Lewis and [[Keith Larsen]], to shoot 29 short films for the anthology ''Adventure in the Amazon'', directed by Tom McGowan (a little-known, recherché filmmaker in database),&lt;ref name="La Selección Inútil"&gt;{{cite web|title=El poeta hippie que margaritas deshojaba|url=http://laseleccioninutil.blogspot.com/2007/07/el-poeta-mugroso-que-deshojaba.html|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produced by [[Warner Bros.]]&lt;ref name="Francisco Bardales 2" /&gt; The series was eventually canceled due to transportation spending.

By the 1960s, film was representing the beauty and calm of the jungle, and Iquitos was home to most regional and international filmmakers. In the 1970s, the cinema of Iquitos was influenced by Decree Law Number 19327, entitled "Law for the Promotion of Film Industry." The decree facilitated the production of new films, and the presentation of the Amazon image.&lt;ref name="Joaquín García" /&gt;

The film went on to a more complex film language with themes about the richness of the jungle, the imperialist power, mining and resource processing, and use of the natives as a portrait of tourism. During these years, there were notable films such as ''[[No Stars in the Jungle]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Green Wall]]'' (1969) by [[Armando Robles Godoy]]; ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'' (1972) and ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]'' (1982) by [[Werner Herzog]]; ''The Ayahuasca Wind'' (1983) by Nora Izcue and ''The Partner of God'' (1986) by Federico Garcia.&lt;ref name="Francisco Bardales 2" /&gt;  In 1990, Iquitos was gradually used as a stage for national and international soap operas; it was the backdrop for ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]'' (1997) by [[Luis Llosa]]; ''[[Captain Pantoja and the Special Services (2000 film)|Captain Pantoja and the Special Services]]'' (2000) by [[Francisco Lombardi]]; ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'' by Walter Salles and ''Daughters of Belén'' (2004) by Javier Corcuera.

In 2002, publicist Dorian Fernandez-Moris founded Audiovisual Films&amp;mdash;founded as Audiovisual&amp;mdash;and began with a team of twenty people.&lt;ref name="El Comercio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hidalgo Vega|first=David|title=Un cine de mitos selváticos|url=http://elcomercio.pe/edicionimpresa/html/2008-05-30/un-cine-mitos-selvaticos.html|work=El Comercio|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began with short films like ''El otro lado'', ''Runamula'' and ''501'', and subsequently made a series of workshops to increase interest in Iquitos cinephile.&lt;ref name="El Comercio" /&gt; In 2006, he released ''Chullachaqui'' (based on an Amazon known legend), ''Immortal'', and the film ''El último piso'' (18 February 2010). The latter was filmed at the tallest building in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avant premiere de El último piso|url=http://diariodeiqt.wordpress.com/2010/02/20/avant-premiere-de-el-ultimo-piso/|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Audiovisual Films produced ''[[General Cemetery]]'' in Iquitos, and is scheduled for release in October 2012.&lt;ref name=Cinencuentro1878&gt;{{cite news|title="Cementerio general": filman película en Iquitos, con Marisol Aguirre, Nikko Ponce y Leslie Shaw|url=http://www.cinencuentro.com/2012/01/13/cementerio-general-filme-pelicula-peru-iquitos-marisol-aguirre-nikko-ponce-leslie-shaw/|accessdate=23 May 2012|newspaper=Cinencuentro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Citronaut''' was the first mascot of Florida Technical University, which later became The [[University of Central Florida]]. The mascot appeared on the first student handbook in 1968–1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucfknights.com/news/2007/4/19/UCF_Receives_Knighthood.aspx UCF Receives Knighthood. UCF Athletic Association.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucf.edu/pegasus/one-small-step-man-one-giant-leap-ucf/ One Small Step for Man, One Giant Leap for UCF. [[Pegasus (University of Central Florida magazine)|Pegasus]]]&lt;/ref&gt; After one year, students petitioned the [[Student Government]] to establish a new mascot for the university. In 1970, students approved "Knights of the Pegasus" as the second official university mascot, which remains to this day.&lt;ref name="knightro"/&gt;

==History==
The Citronaut was designed by Norman Van Meter, the brother-in-law of FTU's then-president [[Charles N. Millican]] in an attempt to combine the two major themes of Central Florida at the time: the [[NASA|space program]] and the [[Citrus production|citrus industry]]. UCF was founded in 1963 to provide personnel to support [[NASA]] at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] and [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]]. As the academic scope of the university broadened, it was renamed to The University of Central Florida in 1978.&lt;ref name="2000_facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iroffice.ucf.edu/character/char0001.html|title=Facts About UCF - 2000–2001|accessdate=July 14, 2009|publisher=University of Central Florida|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531013846/http://www.iroffice.ucf.edu/character/char0001.html|archivedate=May 31, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uaps.ucf.edu/enrollment/current_projections_enrollment.html |title=UCF Enrollment Projections 2012-17 |accessdate=August 19, 2013 |publisher=University of Central Florida |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051212054318/http://uaps.ucf.edu/enrollment/current_projections_enrollment.html |archivedate=December 12, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Florida produces approximately 100 million boxes of citrus annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perez|first1=Marvin|title=Orange Juice Enters Bull Market With Biggest Rally Since ’98|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-24/orange-juice-enters-bull-market-with-biggest-rally-since-1998|accessdate=25 March 2015|work=[[Bloomberg News]]|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Appearances==
Since 2014, the Citronaut has experienced a renaissance in university publications, athletics programing, and merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.ucf.edu/knights-baseball-team-welcomes-back-citronaut/ Knights Baseball Team Welcomes Back the Citronaut.

'''Classroom pets''' are animals that are present in an educational classroom as a pet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daly|first=Beth|last2=Suggs|first2=Suzanne|date=2010-02-12|title=Teachers' experiences with humane education and animals in the elementary classroom: implications for empathy development|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03057240903528733|journal=Journal of Moral Education|language=en|volume=39|issue=1|pages=101–112|doi=10.1080/03057240903528733|issn=0305-7240}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research and literature over the past decade, has shown the main reasons for having classroom pets is to capture the attention of students, improve relationships, provide the opportunity for creative activities, be a resource for humane education, and act as a motivator for students.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Correale|first=Cinzia|last2=Crescimbene|first2=Lara|last3=Borgi|first3=Marta|last4=Cirulli|first4=Francesca|last5=Correale|first5=Cinzia|last6=Crescimbene|first6=Lara|last7=Borgi|first7=Marta|last8=Cirulli|first8=Francesca|date=2017-11-27|title=Development of a Dog-Assisted Activity Program in an Elementary Classroom|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2306-7381/4/4/62|journal=Veterinary Sciences|language=en|volume=4|issue=4|pages=62|doi=10.3390/vetsci4040062|pmc=5753642|pmid=29186915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational impact ==

In 1987, The National Institute of Health reported evidence on the health benefits of pets and further studies have shown positive effects from children’s relationships with pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poresky|first=Robert H.|last2=Hendrix|first2=Charles|date=1990-08|title=Differential Effects of Pet Presence and Pet-Bonding on Young Children|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pr0.1990.67.1.51|journal=Psychological Reports|language=en|volume=67|issue=1|pages=51–54|doi=10.2466/pr0.1990.67.1.51|issn=0033-2941}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has thus been assumed that similar benefits would present themselves with classroom pets on students.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ganzert, R. R., &amp; McCullough, A.|first=|date=2015|title=Pets in the classroom study: Phase I findings report.|url=http://site.americanhumane.org/Resources/PETS%20IN%20THE%20CLASSROOM%20CKT%20R4.pdf|journal=American Humane Association|volume=|pages=1–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social-emotional development ===

Classroom pets can support young children's social-emotional development.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Classroom pets help build positive relationships through discussions about classroom pets, such as what to name it, and how to care for it, and then working together to do so.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This also aids in the development of friendships within the classroom.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It has been found that students develop a sense of caring about others other than themselves through tending to the needs of the animals in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It has also been seen that discussions about the behaviors of the animals in the classroom, what they mean, and what the students can do about it can help students become empathetic towards others.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Teachers have claimed that classroom pets also teach children the value of routines and rules. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One study compared students in a classroom with class pets to one without for 8 weeks.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The study found that both parents and teachers reported that the students in the class with the guinea pigs had greater increases in social skills and decreases in behavior problems at the end of the 8 weeks.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These results support similar previous study results.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Young children's interaction with classroom pets can also help them manage feelings and emotions. Research has shown that children need an empathetic listener whenever they feel troubled. Children can be encouraged to share their feelings with their animals if they do not want to express them with an adult.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A study surveying 75 elementary teachers, revealed that most teachers believed students displayed an increase in compassion and empathy when pets were used in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Additional findings have shown that classroom pets, not only improve compassion and empathy but also teach children to have respect for the living things in the world around them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Classroom pets can also have a positive effect on the socio-emotional development of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  After engaging in animal-assisted activities for 8-weeks, children with ASD displayed an increase in social skills and a decrease in social withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Haire|first=Marguerite E.|last2=McKenzie|first2=Samantha J.|last3=McCune|first3=Sandra|last4=Slaughter|first4=Virginia|date=2014-03|title=Effects of Classroom Animal-Assisted Activities on Social Functioning in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder|url=http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/acm.2013.0165|journal=The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine|language=en|volume=20|issue=3|pages=162–168|doi=10.1089/acm.2013.0165|issn=1075-5535|pmc=3948601|pmid=24156772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic development ===

Teachers conveyed that classroom pets contribute to the academic development of students and have identified pets as important sources for students.  They have found them to expand learning and increase development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Academic lessons, ranging from science to language arts, have been enriched by this valuable source and have improved academic competence among students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Classroom pets create an object of observation and research for children during science class. Children will learn how to care for the animal, what it eats, and what type of surroundings it needs to live. Science can also be linked with language arts using classroom pets. Students can write books and create presentations from their research. Students academic skills in math also increase by having a classroom pet. Students can measure its physical attributes and how quickly or how far it moves using graphs or charts (Benham, 1991, p.21).

=== Increased teacher awareness ===

Through the use of a Dog-Assisted Activity Program in a multi-cultural elementary classroom, researchers found that teachers are more aware of student difficulties and strengths after interacting with dogs.  After engaging with dogs, it was found that students expressed emotions and displayed behaviors more clearly, helping teachers recognize student qualities that were hidden prior to the dog-assisted activity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This suggests that the presence of classroom pets does not only benefit students but also results in increased teacher awareness.  Despite these results, survey research shows that only about 17% of elementary teachers have classroom pets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''contralto''' ({{IPA-it|konˈtralto}}) is a type of [[classical music|classical]] female [[singing]] [[human voice|voice]] whose [[vocal range]] is the lowest female [[voice type]].&lt;ref name=McKinney&gt;{{cite book

The contralto's vocal range is fairly rare; similar to the [[mezzo-soprano]], and almost identical to that of a [[countertenor]], typically between the F below middle C (F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in [[scientific pitch notation]]) to the second F above middle C (F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), although, at the extremes, some voices can reach the D below middle C (D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voiceteacher.com/contralto.html |title=Training the Contralto Voice |last=Jones |first=David L. |date=2007 |website=The Voice Teacher |accessdate=2018-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the second B{{Music|flat}} above middle C (B{{Music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt; The contralto voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, lyric, and dramatic contralto.

== History ==
"Contralto" is primarily meaningful only in reference to classical and [[opera]]tic singing, as other traditions lack a comparable [[Voice classification in non-classical music|system of vocal categorization]]. The term "contralto" is only applied to female singers; men singing in a similar range are called "[[countertenor]]s".&lt;ref name=Appelman /&gt; The Italian terms "contralto" and "[[alto]]" are not synonymous, the latter technically denoting a specific [[vocal range]] in choral singing without regard to factors like tessitura, vocal [[timbre]], vocal facility, and [[vocal weight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy|last=Stark|first=James|year=2003|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|isbn=978-0-8020-8614-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contralto voice range is between [[tenor]] and [[mezzo-soprano]]. Although tenors, baritones, and basses are male singers, some women can sing as low (albeit with a slightly different timbre and texture than their male counterparts). Unfortunately, they are often erroneously referred to as "female tenors", "female baritones", "female basses" or "androgynous." In reality, such terms are usually derogatory informal (slang).

== Subtypes and roles in opera ==
The earliest cited role for the contralto is traditionally accepted to be that of the Saracen princess Clorinde in [[André Campra]]'s 1702 opera ''[[Tancréde]]'', and most famously performed by (and was originally written for) [[Julie d'Aubigny]].&lt;ref name="bas-dessus"&gt;The part of Clorinde is notated in the [[soprano clef]] ([http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9058774w/f130.image.r=Tancr%C3%A8de%201702.langEN original score, p. 71]), but, although it never descends below d′, tradition has it that it was the first major ''bas-dessus'' (contralto) role in the French opera history (Sadie, Julie Anne, ''Maupin'', in Sadie, Stanley (ed), ''op. cit.'', III, p. 274).&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the contralto voice type category are three generally recognized subcategories: [[coloratura]] contralto, lyric contralto, and dramatic contralto. These subtypes do not always apply with precision to individual singers; some exceptional dramatic contraltos, such as [[Ernestine Schumann-Heink]] and [[Sigrid Onégin]], were technically equipped to perform not only heavy, dramatic music by the likes of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] but also florid compositions by [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]].

=== Coloratura ===
The coloratura contralto has a light, agile voice ranging very high for the classification and atypically maintains extensive coloratura and high sustaining notes, specializing in florid passages and leaps. Given its deviations from the classification's norms, this voice type is quite rare.

=== Lyric===
The lyric contralto voice is lighter than a dramatic contralto but not capable of the [[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]] and leaps of a coloratura contralto. This class of contralto, lighter in timbre than the others, is the most common today and usually ranges from the E below middle C (E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the second G above middle C (G&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;).

=== Dramatic ===
The dramatic contralto is the deepest, darkest, and heaviest contralto voice, usually having a heavier tone and more power than the others. Singers in this class are rare.

True operatic contraltos are rare, and the operatic literature contains few roles written specifically for them. Contraltos sometimes are assigned feminine roles like Angelina in ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', Rosina in ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'', Teodata in "[[Flavio]]", Isabella in ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'', and Olga in ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'', but more frequently they play female villains or [[Breeches role|trouser roles]]. Contraltos may also be cast in roles originally written for [[castrato|castrati]]. A common saying among contraltos is that they may play only "witches, bitches, or [[Wikt:britches|britches]]."&lt;ref name=Boldrey&gt;{{cite book

In [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] theory, the '''Cosmic Man''' is an archetypal figure that appears in [[creation myth]]s of a wide variety of [[mythology]]. Generally he is described as helpful or positive, and serves as a seed for the creation of the world, such that after death parts of his body became physical parts of the [[universe]]. He also represents the oneness of human existence, or the universe. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

For example, in [[Chinese mythology|Chinese legend]], [[Pangu]] is thought to have given the natural features of the [[Earth]] their form, and when he died his body became the [[Sacred Mountains of China]]. The Persian equivalent, [[Keyumars]], released [[semen]] when he died, out of which came the first human couple. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In some Jewish legends, [[Adam]] was created from dust from the four corners of the Earth, and, when bent down, his head was the East and his feet the West. In another legend, he contained the soul of everybody who would ever be born. In the teachings of ''[[Kabbalah]]'', such a primordial man is referred to as [[Adam Kadmon]]. In Indian mythology, [[Purusha]] is a similar figure, who is considered the part of the individual which is immortal. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The Cosmic Man corresponds within Islamic Sufi teachings with [[al-Insān al-Kāmil]], meaning 'The Perfect Being", a honorific title often ascribed to [[Prophet Muhammad]]. The concept of [[al-Insān al-Kāmil]] was first coined and discussed by [[Ibn Arabi]].

In many myths, the Cosmic Man is not just the beginning but also the final goal of life or creation. This is not necessarily a physical event, but may refer to the identification of the conscious [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] with the [[self (Jung)|self]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In the religious sciences of [[Islam]], a more detailed explanation is furnished wherein the first Cosmic Man is identified as Adam. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} According to the sciences, Adam is a Cosmic Being because, apart from having an all-embracing power over the Universe,  he also has the most privileged spiritual rank and status of a [[human being]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In more recent elaborations, the Cosmic Man is an awaited Leader who is to destined to appear in order to establish a new and golden Age on earth for all mankind.

The Front Porch Classics game Deer in the Headlights is a card game involving two or more players aged eight and up. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.universitygames.com/deerintheheadlights|title= Deer in the Headlights Card Game|author= University Games|date= |work= |publisher= University Games|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the game is to be the first player to discard their hand of cards in each round to tally the least points and win the game. 

The game is part of the University Game Corporation as of 2014 and can be found in many mainline department stores. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.amazon.com/Front-Porch-Classics-53720-Headlights/dp/B008EBLMS6|title= Deer in the Headlights|author= Amazon|date= |work= |publisher= Front Porch Classics|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setup==

Each game comes with two decks of custom cards, three wooden die, scorecards, and an instruction manual. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

All 3 die will be used in a game. Each dice includes a mix of standard numbers and specialized characters. The characters account for “special rolls” and are shown as a car, a running deer, or a deer in headlights. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The number of the decks dealt out is up to the players. For instance, two players may choose to only deal out one deck. All of the cards in a deck must be dealt out; dealing out two decks of cards will result in a longer game depending on the number of players involved. 

Jokers are discarded from the deck. Space must be made in the center of the playing space for the discarded cards to be placed, and then the play may begin.

==Gameplay==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Deer in the Headlights game materials.png|thumb|left|Game pieces included with Deer in the Headlights]] --&gt;

The object of the game is to be the first player to discard all of the cards in their hand to end the round. Once a round has finished, the rest of the players count their scores by adding up the total value of the remaining cards in their hand. Each player’s score is recorded on the scorecard; the score of the round is recorded in the upper box and the cumulative score is tallied in the lower box. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The game is concluded with the first player to reach 150 points – this player loses the game. The winner of the game is the player who has tallied the least points by the game’s end. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

All cards are added by their associated value. Aces are worth one point. Jacks, Queens, and Kings are all worth ten points each. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Players take turns tossing the die, starting with the dealer. Each player conducts their turn based on the card play associated with their roll. There are ten different variations of card plays available. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Story==
Serenity is just an average college girl, but when she suddenly loses contact with her father Dr. Aleister, she sets out to find him at the Salem State Hospital &amp; Asylum where he works. Serenity arrives to find she barely recognizes the hospital any more. Stepping warily into the shattered ruins, she meets a talking teddy bear. Introducing himself as David, the talking teddy bear claims to have once been human, but when Serenity asks him about her father’s whereabouts, countless demons suddenly appear. Just before her father disappeared, he had sent a mysterious app to her smartphone. Known as the Demons' Score, the app is a powerful program that enables her to take control of demons that possess her body.&lt;ref name="itunes"&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/demons-score/id532473429?mt=8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Altmer High Elves trapped and outnumbered but we won't die today.jpg|thumb|Four images assembled into one final image]]
'''Digital compositing''' is the process of digitally assembling multiple images to make a final image, typically for print, [[film|motion pictures]] or screen display.  It is the digital analogue of optical film [[compositing]].

==Mathematics==
The basic operation used in digital compositing is known as '[[alpha compositing#Alpha blending|alpha blending]]', where an opacity value, 'α', is used to control the proportions of two input [[pixel]] values that end up a single output pixel.

As a simple example, suppose two images of the same size are available and they are to be composited. The input images are referred to as the foreground image and the background image. Each image consists of the same number of [[pixel]]s. Compositing is performed by mathematically combining information from the corresponding pixels from the two input images and recording the result in a third image, which is called the composited image.

Consider three pixels;
* a foreground pixel, f
* a background pixel, b
* a composited pixel, c
and 
* α, the opacity value of the foreground pixel. (α = 1 for opaque foreground, α = 0 for a completely transparent foreground). A monochrome raster image where the pixel values are to be interpreted as alpha values is known as a [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]].

Then, considering all three colour channels, and assuming that the colour channels are expressed in a γ=1 colour space (that is to say, the measured values are proportional to light intensity), we have:

:c&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = α f&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; + (1 − α) b&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;
:c&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = α f&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; + (1 − α) b&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
:c&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = α f&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; + (1 − α) b&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;

Note that if the operations are performed in a colour space where γ is not equal to 1 then the operation will lead to non-linear effects which can potentially be seen as [[aliasing]] artifacts (or '[[jaggies]]') along sharp edges in the matte.  More generally, nonlinear compositing can have effects such as "halos" around composited objects, because the influence of the alpha channel is non-linear.  It is possible for a compositing artist to compensate for the effects of compositing in non-linear space.

Performing alpha blending is an expensive operation if performed on an entire image or 3D scene. If this operation has to be done in real time video games there is an easy trick to boost performance.

:c&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; = α f&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; + (1 − α) b&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;
:c&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; = α f&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; + b&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; − α b&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;
:c&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; = b&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; + α (f&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; − b&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;)

By simply rewriting the mathematical expression one can save 50% of the multiplications required.

===Algebraic properties===
When many partially transparent layers need to be composited together, it is worthwhile to consider the algebraic properties of compositing operators used.  Specifically, the associativity and commutativity determine when repeated calculation can or cannot be avoided.

Consider the case when we have four layers to blend to produce the final image: F=A*(B*(C*D)) where A, B, C, D are partially transparent image layers and "*" denotes a compositing operator (with the left layer on top of the right layer).  If only layer C changes, we should find a way to avoid re-blending all of the layers when computing F.  Without any special considerations, four full-image blends would need to occur.  For compositing operators that are [[commutative]], such as [[additive blending]], it is safe to re-order the blending operations.  In this case, we might compute T=A*(B*D) only once and simply blend T*C to produce F, a single operation.  Unfortunately, most operators are not commutative.  However, many are [[associative]], suggesting it is safe to re-group operations to F=(A*B)*(C*D), i.e. without changing their order.  In this case we may compute S:=A*B once and save this result.  To form F with an associative operator, we need only do two additional compositing operations to integrate the new layer S, by computing F:=S*(C*D).  Note that this expression indicates compositing C with all of the layers below it in one step and then blending all of the layers on top of it with the previous result to produce the final image in the second step.

If all layers of an image change regularly but a large number of layer still need to be composited (such as in distributed rendering), the commutativity of a compositing operator can still be exploited to speed up computation through [[parallelism (computing)|parallelism]] even when there is no gain from pre-computation.  Again, consider the image F=A*(B*(C*D)).  Each compositing operation in this expression depends on the next, leading to serial computation.  However, associativity can allow us to rewrite F=(A*B)*(C*D) where there are clearly two operations that do not depend on each other that may be executed in parallel.  In general, we can build a tree of pair-wise compositing operations with a height that is logarithmic in the number of layers.

==Software ==

The most historically significant nonlinear compositing system was the [[Cineon]], which operated in a logarithmic color space, which more closely mimics the natural light response of film emulsions (the Cineon system, made by Kodak, is no longer in production). Due to the limitations of processing speed and memory, compositing artists did not usually have the luxury of having the system make intermediate conversions to linear space for the compositing steps.  Over time, the limitations have become much less significant, and now most compositing is done in a linear color space, even in cases where the source imagery is in a logarithmic color space.

Compositing often also includes scaling, retouching and colour correction of images.

===Node-based and layer-based compositing===
There are two radically different digital compositing workflows: node-based compositing and layer-based compositing.

Node-based compositing represents an entire composite as a tree graph, linking media objects and effects in a procedural map, intuitively laying out the progression from source input to final output, and is in fact the way all compositing applications internally handle composites. This type of compositing interface allows great flexibility, including the ability to modify the parameters of an earlier image processing step "in context" (while viewing the final [[compositing|composite]]). Node-based compositing packages often handle keyframing and time effects poorly, as their workflow does not stem directly from a timeline, as do layer-based compositing packages. Software which incorporates a node based interface include [[Natron (software)|Natron]], [[Apple Shake]], [[Blender (software)|Blender]], [[Blackmagic Fusion]], and [[Nuke (software)|The Foundry's Nuke]].

Layer-based compositing represents each media object in a composite as a separate layer within a timeline, each with its own time bounds, effects, and keyframes. All the layers are stacked, one above the next, in any desired order; and the bottom layer is usually [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]] as a base in the resultant image, with each higher layer being progressively rendered on top of the previously composited of layers, moving upward until all layers have been rendered into the final composite. Layer-based compositing is very well suited for rapid [[2D computer graphics|2D]] and limited [[3D computer graphics|3D]] effects such as in motion graphics, but becomes awkward for more complex composites entailing a large number of layers. A partial solution to this is some programs' ability to view the composite-order of elements (such as images, effects, or other attributes) with a visual diagram called a [[Flowchart (Adobe)|flowchart]] to nest compositions, or "comps," directly into other compositions, thereby adding complexity to the render-order by first compositing layers in the beginning composition, then combining that resultant image with the layered images from the proceeding composition, and so on. An example of this exists in the Adobe program [[After Effects]].

'''Expandable water toys''' or '''Grow-in-water toys''', often called '''Grow Monsters''' are [[novelty item]]s made from a [[superabsorbent polymer]]. They are toys that expand after putting them into water for several days. Also, it shrinks with saltwater, though most shrink simply from air after being removed from water. They are made from polymers that can absorb and retain extremely large amounts of a liquid relative to their own mass.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/2004/pdf/7604x0889.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
Grow Monsters come in many different shapes and sizes. [[Reptiles]] and dinosaurs are common figures, but there are many others, such as: sharks, squid, seahorses, lobster, insects, humans, and mechas from popular [[anime]] are among them. Many of the companies that distribute them are Chinese trading companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.topwelltoys.com.tw/detail/8333/8333.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madeinchina.com/2788469/P6032079/Novetly-Toys-Growing-Reptile-Toys-Grow-in-water-Toys-solid.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Water Balz look like marbles, but expand to the size of a [[racquetball]] in water.&lt;ref name=hazard&gt;{{cite news|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/17/expanding-ball-toy-poses-hazard-to-children-and-pets/|title=Expanding Ball Toy Poses Hazard to Children and Pets|last=O'Connor|first=Anahad|date=17 September 2012|work=Well|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The introduction and popularity of these toys has followed the development of superabsorbent polymers. In the early 1970s, the superabsorbent polymer was used commercially for the first time for disposable hygienic products. The first product markets were feminine sanitary napkins and adult incontinence products. The development of superabsorbent technology and performance has been largely led by demands in the disposable hygiene segment. Strides in absorption performance have allowed the development of the ultra-thin baby [[diaper]] which uses a fraction of the materials – particularly fluff pulp – that earlier disposable diapers consumed. Over the years, technology has progressed so that there is little if any starch-grafted superabsorbent polymer used in disposable hygienic products. These super absorbents typically are cross-linked acrylic homo-polymers (usually sodium neutralized).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.m2polymer.com/html/history_of_superabsorbents.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks and recalls==
Starting from January 15, 2007 there have been several recalls on these toys. Ireland, Poland, Cyprus, Lithuania, Hungary and the United Kingdom have recalled the Magic Grow Reptile and Dinosaur Eggs Wild World due to a [[choking]] risk. They claim the products pose a risk of choking due to the fact that after 72 hours in water, the toys expand more than 500% in three directions, and that the products do not comply with the Toys Directive and the relevant European standard EN 71.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toysafetyrecalls.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

Water Balz have been swallowed and lodged in the guts of children, requiring surgery to remove.&lt;ref name=hazard/&gt;

There are several types of [[National FFA Organization]] judging contests (otherwise known as Career Development Events) in which High School age kids compete based on their knowledge of a particular subject.  Each school has several different types of teams that compete against other schools.  These contests are organized by FFA advisors and local experts. The purpose of these competitions is to determine which team and individuals have the best ability to evaluate a particular animal or item as compared to an "official". The official placings and answers are set by an expert in the discipline. Officials are often from agricultural universities or USDA employees.

One of the most popular competitions is [[Livestock]] Judging.  This is where teams of four students judge a series of classes (usually of four animals each) and rank them based on criteria to choose the most superior animal (e.g. muscling, conformation). In Livestock judging, students only judge cattle, pigs and lambs; classes consist of animals in some cases from all over the region. Part of the contest is to give "reasons".  This is basically a short persuasive speech in which the contestant explains their evaluation of the animals to an official for a score (0-50).

Another popular competition is Horse judging. This is similar to livestock, but students only evaluate horses again in classes of four. They evaluate the animals based on criteria such as conformation, gait, and muscling. Reasons are also given in Horse judging.

Meat judging is also popular and consists of teams of 4 students.  Meat judging is based on several contest areas and only includes pork, beef and lamb. Contest areas include class placing (four similar cuts or carcasses of meat evaluated on muscle, fat and bone), identification (correctly identifying the type of cut and where it came from on the animal) and carcass grading (determining the quality and yield grading of a beef carcass).

Each state has statewide competitions each year in which students compete for the state title in each contest area. Many of the state winners go on to compete in national competitions (some held at the National FFA convention).

There are many other contest areas including:
*Agricultural Mechanics
*Agronomy
*Wool
*Land
*Homesite
*Pasture &amp; Range
*Horticulture
*Wildlife
*Floriculture
*Farm Business Management
*Landscape Design
*Crops
*Entomology
*Dairy Foods 
*Forestry

'''Filk music''' is a musical culture, genre, and community tied to [[Science fiction fandom|science fiction/fantasy/horror fandom]] and a type of [[fan labor]]. The genre has been active since the early 1950s, and played primarily since the mid-1970s.

==Etymology and definitions==
The term "filk" (originally a [[typographical error]]) predates 1955.&lt;ref name = "Coppa in Hellekson and Busse"&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[#etymology|below]].)

=== Definitions ===
It is used 
* as a noun:
** referring to the genre (thus equivalent to "filk music") or to a filk song
** it can also be used to refer to a gathering with the primary purpose of singing filk songs. Such a gathering held in someone's home is called a ''housefilk''
** "A filk of ___" refers to a filksong based on another song, using the same tune and often, but not necessarily, similar structure of plot and/or lyrics. It may be a [[Parody music|parody]] of the original (not necessarily humorous), with content referring back to it, or  it may be a [[contrafactum]] which reuses the music and possibly the lyrical structure of the original, but with different words. Full appreciation of a parody requires familiarity with the original, but appreciation of a contrafactum may not.
* as a verb:
** (intransitive) To participate in filk singing, not necessarily as a planned or organized event, as in "The party guests filked."
** (transitive) To write a filk music parody of an existing song, humorous or otherwise, as in "I filked '[[Hope Eyrie#Music|Hope Eyrie]]'." When used in this way, "filk" does not imply that all song parodies are considered filk music, nor does it imply that all filk songs are parodies. Setting satirical or parody lyrics to established tunes is not exclusively the province of science fiction fandom: works of [[parody music]] such as those found in ''[[MAD Magazine]]'' or performed by [[Weird Al Yankovic]] have their own long-established traditions and history.

As Interfilk's "What is it?" page demonstrates, there is no consensus on the definition of filk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfilk.org/interfilk/filk.htm "Filk Music: What is it?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231193549/http://www.interfilk.org/interfilk/filk.htm |date=31 December 2005 }}. Last revised: September 23, 2013. Accessed September 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Attempts have been made to define filk based on various criteria.

===Style and content===
Filk has been defined as [[folk music]], usually with a science fiction or [[fantasy]] theme, but this definition is not exact. '''Filkers''' have been known to write filk songs about a variety of topics, including but not limited to tangentially related topics such as computers and cats.  In addition, while the majority of filk songs are in the folk style, other styles such as [[blues]], [[calypso music|calypso]], and even [[rock music|rock]] appear from time to time.

===Performer===
Filk has been defined as what is sung or performed by the network of people who originally gathered to sing at [[science fiction conventions|science fiction/fantasy conventions]].  This definition might be summarized as, &lt;!-- '"I can't define it, but I can point at it."'--&gt; "We can argue what it is until we're red or green or blue, but when filkers get together it's the thing we do."&lt;ref&gt;"The Definition of Filk"  [song title], Mark Mandel, ''Consonance 2003 Songbook'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology===
Yet another definition focuses on filking as a community of those who are interested in filk music and who form part of the social network self-identified with filking. As described later in this article, the origins of filk in science fiction conventions and its current organization emphasizes the social-network aspect of filking.  The social aspect of filk as contrasted with the "performer vs. audience" dichotomy of much of modern music was described in a speech by [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]] [[Barry and Sally Childs-Helton|Dr. Sally Childs-Helton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hoftribe.html| title= Filk Hall of Fame: This Is My Tribe| publisher= | deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110416044503/http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hoftribe.html| archivedate= 16 April 2011| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By any of these definitions, filk is a form of music created from within [[science fiction fandom|science fiction and fantasy fandom]], often performed late at night at science fiction conventions, though there are now dedicated filk conventions in Canada, England, Germany, and the USA.  The boundaries of filking are vague. For example, filking overlaps with the singing and music performed by participants in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] or at [[LARP]]s.

==Styles and subjects==
In keeping with the folk-culture roots of filk, the musical styles and topics of filk music are eclectic. While a plurality of filk is rooted firmly in acoustic-instrument folk music, other pieces and artists draw inspiration from [[Rock music|rock]], [[a cappella]] vocal groups, or other styles. The hobbyist and itinerant nature of filk events (especially filk circles) gives some advantages to acoustic-vocal soloists and small groups, who need only carry a lightweight instrument or two and whose rehearsals do not need to balance scheduling logistics against regular work and other obligations. One of the few rock-style groups in filk has been [[Ookla the Mok (band)|Ookla the Mok]], whose studio recordings use techniques common in modern rock.  Some styles of filk rely heavily on sampling the original source material and integrating it into electronica and hip-hop music such as 76's ''Objects in Space'' (an homage to the popular TV show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', which itself featured several filk songs) and [[DJ Qbert]]'s ''[[Wave Twisters]].''

The range of topics in filk songs stems from its cultural roots in fandom. Many songs honor specific works in science fiction, fantasy, or speculative fiction. Other songs are about science, fantasy, computers, technology in general, or values related to technological change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2005/09/68697 |first= Xeni |last= Jardin |title= Filk Music for Nerd People| work= Wired |date=1 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet others are about the culture of fandom, including filk itself (both as a phenomenon within fandom, and as a sub-culture). Many filk songs (such as [[Leslie Fish]]'s "[[Carmen Miranda|Carmen Miranda's]] Ghost Is Haunting Space Station 3") are humorous while others treat their subjects seriously (like [[Steve Macdonald (filk musician)|Steve Macdonald's]] "Journey's Done").

However, some common themes do not fall neatly into filk's science fiction origins. Such topics include songs about cats, popular culture, and politics. These are perhaps best explained as an outgrowth of filk as a folk culture, open in some respects to expansion by individual artists.

A significant number of filk songs are [[Parody music|parodies]], whether in the original sense of simply re-using a tune or in the modern sense of specifically humorous re-use.&lt;ref name="Bragg"&gt;{{cite news |first=Roy |last=Bragg |work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |title=Filk: Sci-fi meets folk music |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/music/Filk_Sci-fi_meets_folk_music_98699099.html?showFullArticle=y |date=18 July 2010 |accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some are parodies of songs from popular culture, others are parodies of existing filk songs. Although parody is not the primary focus of the filk music culture, the proportion of parody songs found in filk is higher than in other musical cultures.

One subtype of filk songs is the "ose" song, one on themes of death and gloom.  The term derives from the word "morose", as in "ose, morose, even-more-ose".&lt;ref name=Rogow&gt;{{cite book| last=Rogow| first=Roberta| title=Futurespeak: A Fan's Guide to the Language of Science Fiction| date=1991| publisher=[[Paragon House]]| page=238| location=New York| isbn=978-1557783479 | authorlink= Roberta Rogow }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further variant is "cheeri-ose": ose songs to cheery tunes, or treating such a subject lightheartedly; cf. [[Tom Lehrer]]'s (non-filk) "Irish Ballad".

==History==
For the first few decades of the occasional [[science fiction convention]], there had been late-night singing sessions in hotel rooms. Part of this practice may have been rooted in an older folk culture of fans. Some of the oldest filks coming out of fandom were protest songs with original words and music written by a group of New York fans called [[Futurians|The Futurians]], and were written by [[Fred Pohl]] and [[Cyril Kornbluth]] (see [[Damon Knight|Damon Knight's]] book of the same name, which contains the words and music to several of them). With the break up of the city clubs common during the [[Great Depression]], filking moved to science fiction conventions, often in the form of late-night singing sessions in hotel rooms, lobbies, service passages, or wherever else the filkers could find enough room to play/sing music uninterrupted.

{{anchor|etymology}}In the early 1950s, the term ''filk music'' started as a misspelling of ''folk music'' in an essay by Lee Jacobs, "The Influence of Science Fiction on Modern American Filk Music". Wrai Ballard, then editor of the Spectator [[amateur press association|Amateur Press Society]] refused to publish it for fear that the article's bawdy content could get them into trouble with the [[United States Postal Inspection Service|Post Office]] under the [[Comstock Laws]], but found the typo itself amusing, and mentioned it repeatedly;&lt;ref name=Gold97&gt;{{cite web| last1=Gold| first1=Lee| authorlink1=Lee Gold| title=An Egocentric and Convoluted History of Early Filk and Filking| url= http://www.fanac.org/Fan_Histories/filkhist.html| website=The Fanac Fan History Project| accessdate=20 November 2014| quote=Lee Jacobs, a LArea [= Los Angeles area] fan who [...] in the 50s, [had] submitted an essay to SAPS (Spectator Amateur Press Society) entitled “The Influence of Science Fiction on Modern American Filk Music” supposedly about science fiction incidents in folk song, but actually a straight-faced analysis of a number of thoroughly filthy “dirty songs,” taking various metaphors in them as if they were meant literally.}} Originally published in the ''[[ConChord]] 12 Songbook'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; thus,  Jacobs' typo became the self-identified term for the genre/subculture while it was still an informal, unrecognized activity at conventions.  Its first documented deliberate use was by [[Karen Anderson (writer)|Karen Anderson]] in ''Die Zeitschrift für vollständigen Unsinn'' (''The Journal for Utter Nonsense'') #774 (June 1953), for a song written by her husband [[Poul Anderson]].&lt;ref name="firstUse"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nightsong.com/filk/twippledop/ |title=Tracking Down The First Deliberate Use Of "Filk Song" |accessdate=2006-11-25 |first=Lee |last=Gold |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121206001047/http://www.nightsong.com/filk/twippledop/ |archivedate=6 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s also saw the first formal publication of filksongs, generally as lyric sheets, but occasionally complete with (often original) music.  While many of those original songs faded into obscurity, some remained popular for decades.  By the late 1970s, periodicals such as ''Kantele'' and ''Philk Fee-Nom-Ee-Non'' offered a ready outlet for filk writers.

At the 1974 [[World Science Fiction Convention]] author [[Robert Asprin|Bob Asprin]] announced publicly the creation of a group of volunteers he dubbed the Dorsai Irregulars, and a singing session ensued later that night.&lt;ref name="dorsaiHistory"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.di.org/di_f_his.htm |title=Filk Music and the Dorsai Irregulars |accessdate=2006-11-25 |author=John Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s, filking slowly became established as an acknowledged activity at science fiction conventions. Some convention organizers allotted hotel function space late at night for filkers, or filking occurred in hallways, bars or any other place that the filkers could find. Some convention organizers in the 1980s began inviting guests specifically for their filking. Some specialized conventions focused entirely on filk, beginning with FilkCon in Chicago in 1979, organized by Margaret Middleton and Curt Clemmer, later joined by BayFilk in Northern California; the [[Ohio Valley Filk Fest]] (OVFF) in Columbus, Ohio; ConChord in Los Angeles and in San Diego,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ConChord History Pages |url= http://www.sandiegofilk.com/ConchordMain.html |accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; California; Musicon in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; [[FilKONtario]] near [[Toronto]], Ontario; a rotating British filkcon, and one (NEFilk) in the northeastern US;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.nefilk.us/| title=The Northeast Filk Convention| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the German FilkCONtinental;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filkcontinental.de/fc/home/index.php FilkCONtinental] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

These efforts grew to include raising funds for traveling filkers. The first was a British Filk Fund. Then, in the early 1990s, several active organizers in North America created Interfilk, which is now the most active traveling filker fund. Beginning with British filker Mike Whitaker in 1992, 40 filkers were the beneficiaries of Interfilk subsidies in its first decade. OVFF began presenting the [[Pegasus Award]] annually for excellence in filk in 1984, and FilkOntario started the Filk Hall of Fame in 1995, honoring contributions to the community as well as to the music.

After years of amateur tape recordings made at filksings, a trickle of studio-produced albums and tapes began to arrive in the 1970s.  These included ''Folk Songs for Folk Who Ain't Been Yet'', featuring Leslie Fish and friends, and ''Children of the Future'' by Karen Willson.

[[Off Centaur Publications]] was one of the first formal attempts to regularly produce and promote filk albums, followed by many others since. As the costs of amateur album production dropped in the 1990s, more filkers created albums and, more recently, audio files available for downloading online.

E-mail and the internet have also fostered the networking of self-identified filkers. In the late 1980s, California filker Kay Shapero created the filk group on the [[Fidonet]] hobbyist network of electronic bulletin boards. The later creation of other electronic forums — the Usenet group, a United Kingdom e-mail list FILK_UK and the German language list, an IRC channel devoted to filking, and a growing cluster of filkers blogging on [[LiveJournal]] (including a LiveJournal community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filk.livejournal.com/ |title=The Filk Community |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), to pick a few examples — have mirrored the growing connections among other self-identified social networks (or subcultures). The availability of several hundred albums labeled filk, the proliferation of specialty filk conventions, and the continued growth of electronic means for community connections have led to an intensification of community building. A few years into the 21st&amp;nbsp;century, filking as an identifiable community exists on at least three continents.

On the album ''Precious Friend'', [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Arlo Guthrie]] perform "Old Time Religion", in a filk version.  Most of the verses of this version were by [[Gordon R. Dickson|Gordon Dickson]]; when Seeger finally discovered this, after the album was issued, he sent royalties on to Dickson.

==Filk Circle==
Filk music is most commonly performed in a gathering known as a ''Filk Circle''. Similar to the [[drum circle|Drum Circles]] and Bardic Circles found at [[society for creative anachronism|SCA]] events and other [[science fiction fandom|fannish]] events, filk circles can be formed in any location where filkers gather.

Filk circles are different from concert-style musical performances. Although filk music can also be performed in front of an audience, and there are concerts scheduled at filk conventions and science fiction conventions worldwide, filk circles are a more common occurrence. The purpose of a filk circle is for musicians to share songs with other musicians, so performing and listening are given equal emphasis. In a filk circle, there is no stage, there is no audience. Those who participate in a filk circle may choose to perform, to listen, or both. Performers may know only one song, or may know an extensive library of songs. Participants are usually encouraged to join in and sing along or play along on their instruments.

Filk circles can be formalized parts of larger events, such as being assigned a specific time and location on the schedule of a science fiction convention, or they can be completely informal and spontaneous, forming organically in hotel hallways and lobbies. Filk-specific conventions will usually have multiple filk circles happening simultaneously in different rooms, with some circles focused on a single style or topic. Local parties called ''housefilks'' are day-long events in which a single filk circle performs in the host's home.

===Physical layout===
[[File:2006-05-27 Baycon 2006 Saturday Night Open Filk Circle- Photo by Tony Fabris.jpg|thumb|right|A Filk circle at a science fiction convention.]]
As the name implies, a rough circle of chairs is usually formed.&lt;ref name="Bragg"/&gt;  The details depend on the available space and furniture, and it may not even end up being circular, or even have chairs at all. The purpose of the circular formation is both symbolic and functional: By having everyone face each other, it honors all participants as equals, it emphasizes both listening and performing, and it makes each participant visible to every other participant.{{Citation needed|reason=isn't this just - well the obvious way to do it?|date=November 2015}}

A formally organized filk circle can have the chairs set up ahead of time, with the organizers estimating the number of participants and adjusting the size of the circle as best they can. A circle that is too large for the number of participants tends to feel uncomfortably empty, but a circle that is too small must enlarge as the number of participants grows. The disruption that results from attempting to enlarge a filk circle in progress can break up the flow of the songs and change the mood, so enlarging the circle is often avoided in favor of adding extra layers (concentric circles) outside the inner circle, space permitting.

===Time of day===
Traditionally, filk circles are started in the evening and tend to continue very late into the night.&lt;ref name="Bragg"/&gt;  Of course, this depends upon the location, the participants, and the organizers. Filk circles have been known to continue all night, or at least into the early morning hours. Those organizing formal filk circles at conventions usually make arrangements with the hotel to have space available for the entire night. There are many exceptions to this; it's not uncommon to find a housefilk scheduled to start in the early afternoon and end in the early evening, for example, to allow participants to get home to sleep.

===Musical instruments===
At most filk circles, the participants are expected to bring their own musical instruments (if they play an instrument at all), although sometimes you will find organizers or performers bringing a collection of extra instruments so that others may borrow or experiment with them. Most performers who bring instruments such as guitars are usually happy to loan their instruments to someone who comes to the circle without one.

A wide range of instruments can be found in a filk circle, although the most common is the [[acoustic guitar]].&lt;ref name="Bragg"/&gt;  Acoustic instruments are more common than electric instruments, although portable [[electronic keyboard|keyboards]] and even [[theremin]]s are not unheard of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sutton|first1=Brenda|title=Guest of Honor : Dr. Mary Crowell|url=http://conflikt.org/guestbio.php?name=Dr.+Mary+Crowell&amp;title=Guest+of+Honor&amp;year=2011|website=Conflikt: A Pacific NorthWest Filk Convention|accessdate=18 November 2014|date=2011|quote=We watched this beautiful young woman lug her keyboard (not the most portable of filk instruments, mind you) into the filk room with a slight amount of dread and a large measure of anticipation. And then she played her opening measures -- all Gershwiny, bluesy, and fine -- we all relaxed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small, easily portable instruments are more common than large ones, although larger items such as small drum kits and [[double bass|upright basses]] can be found at some filk circles. A large filk circle might play host to an array of folk and Celtic instruments such as [[fiddle]]s, [[mandolin]]s, [[Appalachian dulcimer|dulcimers]], [[banjo]]s, [[flute]]s, [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]], [[bodhran|bodhráns]], [[bongo drum|bongos]] and [[goblet drum|darbukas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Three Weird Sisters (band)]]. "The group performs filk music (science fiction/fantasy folk music) with harp, double bass, guitar, and bodhran accompaniment." Retrieved 18 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Song presentation===
Songs are presented very informally. They can be given with spoken introductions and explanations, or they can be simply played and allowed to speak for themselves. Songs can be chosen to fit the current mood or theme, or they may be chosen to deliberately change the mood. Songs can be performed by individuals, duos, groups, or groups hastily assembled from other participants. Songs can be accompanied by instruments or be performed [[a cappella]]. Songs can be original songs, [[cover version|covers]], [[parody music|parodies]], [[instrumental]]s, or even spoken-word pieces such as poetry and stories.

An active and well-attended filk circle, at its peak, will usually be a somewhat continuous stream of songs, with only a small amount of conversation between songs. Filk circles that are just getting started or winding down may have more talking and socializing than music.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Types===
[[File:Sfcon-music-session-ddb.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Filk circle]]
Filk circles are often given an organizational structure to make it easier for participants to know when it's time to perform or time to listen to other performers. There are many ways to accomplish this, but the most common types of filk circle are listed below.&lt;ref name=Gold:Welcome&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gold|first1=Lee|authorlink1=Lee Gold|title=Welcome to the Filk Circle|url=http://www.massfilc.org/FilkCircle.pdf|website=MASSFILC: The Filk Music Club of New England|accessdate=18 November 2014|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bardic====
In a bardic circle, each person in the circle (as well as those sitting in concentric circles around the inner circle, if any) goes in turn, with each turn moving sequentially either clockwise or counterclockwise around the circle. Each participant is given the choice of ''pick, pass, or play''. "Pick" means they can request a specific song, a specific performer, a general topic or style, or any other similar request from an individual or from the circle in general. "Pass" means they skip their turn and the choice passes on to the next person in sequence. "Play" means they can perform any song they choose, either specific to the current topic or mood, or deliberately different from the current topic or mood.

The advantage of the bardic circle is that it has a clear structure, which enforces politeness. It ensures everyone in the circle gets their turn, so that even shy people can have a chance to request or perform. There are disadvantages, however. A bardic circle with large numbers of participants will take a long time to traverse the entire circle, making people wait too long for their turn. Such a circle was lamented in a filk by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]]: "I've been here with my song at the ready since day before yesterday night."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skeptictank.org/files/en003/filk-018.htm|title=Lyrics and Tune Copyright 1983 Suzette Haden Elgin Song at the Ready The Filksing was crow|first=Fredric L. Rice, The Skeptic|last=Tank|website=www.skeptictank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is less spontaneity in a bardic circle than a chaos circle, and the chance of being able to play a good "follower" song is reduced.

====Chaos====
In a chaos circle, there is no sequential organization. Any performer can simply begin playing a song after the prior song is finished, or any participant can shout out a request. Care must be taken to prevent two songs from starting at the same time. Frequently the word "follower!" is shouted in a chaos circle, meaning that a performer believes they have the perfect song to follow the prior song, and they want to play it now.&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;Gold, Lee; http://www.kayshapero.net/filkcirc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The chaos circle's advantage is its spontaneity and energy. "Runs" of songs will frequently get started, with each new song intended to make some sort of connection to or commentary on the prior song's topic. The disadvantage is that it takes concentration and effort to be polite and respectful in a chaos circle: It's easy to accidentally interrupt another performer who's trying to start up a song of their own, especially in a very large circle where one might not be able to easily hear the other performer on the opposite side of the room. Chaos circles thus have a reputation of favoring bold, loud performers who can command attention. One countermeasure to such conflicts is for someone, generally not one of the current/starting-up performers, to shout "Filker up!", possibly pointing to the one being interrupted. This alerts the room, and specifically the (usually unintentional) interrupter, to be quiet and pay attention to the filker who has started performing.&lt;ref name="Conflikt_Circle_Etiquette"&gt;{{cite web |title=Concert &amp; Circle Etiquette |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |url= http://conflikt.org/content/2016/download/ConfliktRules.pdf |website=Conflikt Rules &amp; Policies |publisher=Conflikt Filk Convention |accessdate=14 May 2017 |ref=Conflikt_Circle_Etiquette |page=1 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Token Bardic====
A token bardic circle, also known as a "poker-chip" bardic circle, attempts to combine the enforced politeness of the bardic circle with the freeform nature of the chaos circle. A container full of some type of token such as poker chips is supplied for the circle. Each person participating in the circle is given a fixed number of tokens when they enter the room (frequently two tokens), and can throw a token into the center of the circle at any time to claim a pick or play turn (see ''Bardic'', above). When all the active tokens in the circle are used up, they are scooped up and redistributed for the next round.&lt;ref name="Gold"/&gt;

The advantage of a token bardic is that there's still a chance for spontaneity and followers, yet it's easy to be polite to other performers because you can easily see when another performer wants a turn. The disadvantage is that, like bardic, in a large circle it may take a long time for you to get another turn after you've used up your existing turns.

There are variations of these styles, some of the variants involving a person acting as a moderator. A given circle can change its style mid-stream, if the participants agree. It's common to see the participants of a bardic circle "go chaos" or vice versa, for example.

===Etiquette===
The etiquette of the filk circle begins with a respect for all music, including (and perhaps especially) amateur music and amateur performers. Everyone is encouraged to perform, regardless of their skill level. No one is criticized except to occasionally give tips or suggestions.&lt;ref name=Gold:Welcome /&gt;

Although singing along and playing along with instruments (including improvisation) is usually encouraged, filk circles are not like [[jam session]]s. Jam sessions are usually focused on extended instrumental improvisation with everyone performing simultaneously, whereas filk circles tend to be more focused on a single performer or group singing an individual song during their turn. Singing along and playing along are expected to be done politely, contributing to the song rather than overshadowing the song's performer. The exception to this rule is when a jam session is specifically scheduled at a filk convention.

Disruptions and distractions are discouraged during a song. This includes walking through the circle, general noise, and conversations. If between-song conversations and noise get out of hand, it's common to hear someone shout "Filker up!" as a signal to end the conversations so that the next person can have their turn.

==Cultural perspective==
There are several shared values that come from the cultural creation of filk in a social network, even one that spans several continents.

At a deep level, the folk culture of filk validates creative arts in the midst of an explicitly technological culture. When accepting induction into the Filk Hall of Fame in 2003, ethnomusicologist Sally Childs-Helton said, ''We have taken our right to be creative and to literally "play" in the best sense of that word.'' Filk combines folk roots, live music circles, and dominant acoustical instrumentation, on the one hand, with high-tech cultural maintenance, on the other hand—a dense network of filkers' web pages, recordings, sound reinforcement at filk conventions, e-mail lists, and so on. The eclectic content of filk frequently contains that assertion of human creativity, especially in connection with technology. (See for example Leslie Fish's [http://www.ovff.org/pegasus/songs/hope-eyrie.html Hope Eyrie].) While there are significant numbers of memorial songs,&lt;ref name=Launius&gt;{{cite web|last1=Launius|first1=Roger D.|title=Got Filk? Lament For Apollo In Modern Science Fiction Folk Music|url=http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.IAC-04-IAA.6.16.1.06|website=Aerospace Research Central|publisher=5th International Astronautical Congress 2004; Vancouver; Canada|accessdate=18 November 2014|date=2004-10-05}} The exact date is taken from the [http://www.iaaweb.org/iaa/Publications/vancouver2004fp.pdf congress program], p.106.
Printed in ''[[Quest: The History of Spaceflight]]'', Bethesda, MD, USA: International Space Business Council, 12 (4) ([http://www.spacehistory101.com/product_p/v124.htm 2005]), Johnson, Stephen, ed. {{ISSN|1065-7738}}&lt;/ref&gt; pessimistic songs blame carelessness, incompetence, and corruption, only rarely considering the frailties of a society built on technology or hopes for the future. Because these themes cross international boundaries in filk, they are not explainable as a purely American optimism vis-a-vis technology (in contrast to Nye, 1996&lt;ref name=Nye /&gt;).

Within the community, the folk culture of filk acknowledges the legitimacy of music created by artists with a broad range of skills. Those who actively identify themselves as filkers include professional musicians, musical novices, and all ranges in between. The repeat appearances of professional musicians at filk-specific conventions suggests a certain amount of respect given high levels of musical skill within filking, even while the culture is open to less experienced musicians. Whether the occasion is a '''housefilk''' in someone's home or a convention (festival) over a weekend, filk culture encourages respectful listening regardless of the performers' skill level and manifest opportunities for participation from single songs in a musical circle to scheduled concerts.

That openness to participation is a marked norm in filking,&lt;ref name=Jenkins92 /&gt; which makes it unusual in a larger society that glorifies competition and super-stardom in performance arts.  Mentorship within the filk community includes formal workshops at conventions as well as the informal swapping of advice in various forums.

Occasional discussions over the boundaries of filk indicates the extent to which participants in filking are both aware of and keenly interested in the definition of filk as a community. Newsgroup debates over such topics as [https://groups.google.com/group/alt.music.filk/browse_thread/thread/27e133d9408370ba/ca2d4f0a1b157027?lnk=st&amp;q=filk+'weird+al'&amp;rnum=3&amp;hl=en#ca2d4f0a1b157027 whether 'Weird Al' Yankovic is a filker] suggest the deep feelings involved. In practice, most formal recognition of filkers in various awards are to those who regularly attend self-identified filk events, not to professional artists whose work may be considered '''found filk'''.&lt;ref name=Launius /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nye&gt;{{cite book | last = Nye | first = David E. | authorlink = | title = American Technological Sublime | publisher = MIT Press | year = 1994 | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | pages = | url = | doi =  | isbn = 0-262-64034-1 | oclc = 36213568}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins92&gt;{{cite book | last = Jenkins | first = Henry | authorlink = Henry Jenkins | title = Textual Poachers: Television Fans and Participatory Culture | publisher = Routledge | year = 1992 | location = New York | pages = | chapter = 'Strangers No More We Sing': Filk Music, Folk Culture, and the Fan Community | url = | doi =  | isbn = 0-415-90571-0 | oclc = 26055104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filkontario.ca/BSCHspeeches.htm |title=Acceptance Speeches of Barry &amp; Sally Childs-Helton |accessdate=2007-11-29 |last=Childs-Helton |first=Barry |author2=Sally Childs-Helton |date=2003-03-29 |work=Filk Hall of Fame |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071023190656/http://www.filkontario.ca/BSCHspeeches.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solomon H.

==Pegasus Awards==
The [[Pegasus Award]]s were founded to recognize and honor excellence in filking. These awards are given annually at the Ohio Valley Filk Fest (or OVFF). Anyone with an interest in filk can nominate songs or individuals for the awards, and anyone can vote. It is not necessary to be a member of the convention to be involved in the nomination and voting process.

Currently awards are given in six categories: Best Song, Best Performer, Best Writer/Composer, Best Classic Song and two topical categories that vary from year to year. Some examples of past categories include: Best Love Song, Best Literature Song, Best Techie Song, Best Sing Along, etc.

The OVFF convention committee solicits nominations for Finalists for the Pegasus Awards (the Nominating Ballot) during the late spring and summer. There is an opinion poll that runs during the year as well to help interested folk brainstorm ideas for the Nominating Ballot. The Finalist Ballot is distributed in the early fall, and must be returned by the opening night of OVFF. Voting can be done online—either to nominate Finalists, or to vote for the Finalists themselves. The final round of voting happens at OVFF itself, where handwritten ballots are collected after the annual Pegasus concert. The entire process is administered by the OVFF convention committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovff.org/pegasus/index.html|title=Pegasus Awards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filk Hall of Fame==
The Filk Hall of Fame&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hofmain.html|title=Filk Hall of Fame|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created by David Hayman in 1995 as a complement to the Pegasus Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Judith Hayman|author2=Dave Hayman|title=The Filk Hall of Fame: A Short History|url=http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hofhistory.html|website=Filk Hall of Fame|accessdate=18 November 2014|date=March 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028172117/http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hofhistory.html|archivedate=28 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Pegasus Awards acknowledge writing and performing, and therefore often reflect who or what is currently popular, the Hall of Fame was intentionally designed to acknowledge long-term or lasting contributions, including those largely behind the scenes.

Anyone may make a nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hofnom.html|title=Filk Hall of Fame: Nomination Information|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620094621/http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hofnom.html|archivedate=20 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A nomination consists of a description of what the nominee has contributed to filk music and the filk community.  Nominations are reviewed annually by a jury consisting of the convention committee of [[FilKONtario]] (with the exception of David Hayman, who serves as administrator) and a representative from the committees of each of that year's other filk conventions.  The jury members vote independently by secret ballot, and thereby select that year's inductees.  Typically, three people are inducted each year, at the banquet at FilKONtario.  A small editorial committee combines and edits the text of the nomination(s) to produce a citation, which is read aloud at the banquet, presented to the inductee along with a plaque, and posted on the Hall of Fame web site.

'''''Freeze!''''' is a [[puzzle game|puzzle]] video game developed by Frozen Gun Games and released in November 2012 for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. 
The game reached the top of the Apple App Store in 61 countries. It received several awards and has downloaded over ten million copies.
The idea and gameplay is developed by Andreas von Lepel, who designed various games for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]] and [[Game Boy]] in the early 80s. The artwork with its dark, atmospheric images was designed by Jonas Schenk.

== Gameplay ==
As a small round hero in eye shape it is necessary to solve different puzzles. The player does not control the character itself, but the prison cells. With the "Freeze" Button the gravity can be deactivated and the eye remains in its place. The cells can be turned to the right position. If you activate the gravity again, the eye drops in the adjusted direction. Deadly stings and various enemies complicate the levels.

== Reception ==
The game won Casual Games Association´s Indie Prize Europe 2013 award. It is also one of the ten best games in 2013 of the Android Quality Index. 
The game received "generally favorable" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}
In [[American English]], the term '''hiatus''' may be used to refer to a break of several weeks or months in the normal [[broadcast programming]] of a [[television series]] in the [[United States]]. Such a break can occur part-way through the season of a series, in which case it is called a '''mid-season break''', or between distinct [[television season]]s (usually starting in June and ending in September, when shooting starts for the next season). On the Northern Hemisphere, the breaks between late November and early February are also referred to as '''winter breaks''' or, in the Christian cultural sphere, '''Christmas breaks'''.

Until the late 1990s, summer breaks were sometimes replaced by summer replacement series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://notjustanothertvsite.com/2015/03/12/why-is-my-favorite-series-on-hiatus-again/|title=Why is My Favorite Series on Hiatus, Again?|publisher=Not Just Another TV Site|language=English|author=Jeff Sack|date=12 March 2015|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planned hiatus==
[[Television station]]s often implement a hiatus for their [[television program|programs]] to split up a season so it will run longer until the next season. Some programs also go on hiatus so that their [[television network]]s can reserve [[episode]]s for airing during ratings [[sweeps]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.time.com/2011/12/30/its-time-to-get-new-shows-on-tv-during-the-holidays/|title=Why the Winter TV Hiatus Makes No Sense|publisher=Times|language=English|author=Jeff Alexander|date=30 December 2011|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein networks compute their [[television advertising]] fees based on their programs' ratings during that period. Programs return from a hiatus in time for the sweeps period so as to generate high ratings, and as such usually include special content in programming such as [[guest stars]], controversial and unexpected plots or topics, extended episodes, and [[Finale (television)|finales]]. Television programs tend to have a hiatus for the [[Christmas and holiday season|late-November, throughout December and early January holidays]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/mar/31/midseason-break|title=Learning to take the mid-season break|publisher=Guardian|language=English|author=Anna Pickard|date=31 March 2010|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the summer if the season does not end before, resuming at some point after, most often mid-January in the case of [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's Day|New Year]], and September in the case of the summer.

In the USA, hiatuses may also be common during the [[Major League Baseball]] [[Major League Baseball postseason|playoffs]] in October, the [[Olympic Winter Games]] in February and various ceremonial awards in March. The mid-season break in the USA usually starts at Thanksgiving in late-November, sometimes ending with a Thanksgiving or Christmas episode, and lasts until [[Super Bowl]] in late January and early February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/01/23/star-wars-rebels-goes-back-hiatus-month/|title=Star Wars Rebels Goes Back On Hiatus For a Month|publisher=Bleedingcool|language=English|author=Dan Wickline|date=4 January 2017|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final episode airing before the Christmas break is usually referred to as the [[midseason finale]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2014/12/december-tv-why-midseason-winter-finales-make-shows-better-67252/|title=December TV: Why Midseason &amp; Winter Finales Make Shows Better|publisher=Indiewire|language=English|author=Ben Travers|date=4 December 2014|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in the northern hemisphere, "winter finale".

At this time, other TV series may be launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.indiewire.com/article/december-tv-theres-more-than-one-oasis-in-the-desert-20141204|title=December TV: There's More than One Oasis in the Desert|publisher=Indiewire|language=English|author=Liz Shannon Miller|date=4 December 2014|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
{{Main|Cancellation (television)}}
A network may put a show on hiatus before canceling it. This may be to evaluate the series' quality, warn the [[television producer]]s in an effort to push them to produce a more profitable product, fill its timeslot with another program to compare ratings, or warn viewers that the show is not pulling its weight in ratings to see how the show performs in reruns before deciding whether or not it deserves another season.

==Other reasons==
A series may be put on hiatus for other reasons. The [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]] forced several television series (including ''[[Pushing Daisies]]'', ''[[Eli Stone]]'', ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]'', ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', and ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'') to go into un-planned hiatus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenertv.com/news-features/tv-hiatus-explained-why-your-favorite-shows-take-breaks-during-the-season/|title=TV Hiatus explained: Why your favorite shows take breaks during the season|publisher=Screen TV|language=English|author=Carina Mackenzie|date=6 April 2012|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deferred the scheduled returns of other series such as ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' for an extended period. A show may go on hiatus in reaction to its content: The [[Pokémon (anime)|''Pokémon'' anime]] was put on hiatus in Japan from December 17, 1997 until April 16, 1998 after the airing of [[Dennō Senshi Porygon|an episode which caused 685 viewers to have seizures]]. A show may also be put on hiatus due to personal issues with a cast member, or an illness or death: examples are the death of ''[[8 Simple Rules]]'' actor [[John Ritter]]; ''[[The Royal Family (TV series)|The Royal Family]]'' being retooled after the death of [[Redd Foxx]]; and ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'' actress [[Demi Lovato]] departing [[Disney Channel]] to deal with personal issues, leading to that show's retooling around the [[Story within a story|show within a show]] ''[[So Random!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/237137/demi-lovato-quitting-sonny-with-a-chance |title=Demi Lovato Quitting Sonny With a Chance |publisher=E!

'''iTV''' was a [[television station]] in [[Thailand]] that was owned by iTV Public Company Limited, a unit of [[Shin Corporation]]. As Thailand's first [[UHF]] channel, the station was started in 1995 when the company was granted a 30-year concession by the Office of the Permanent Secretary to the Prime Minister's Office to operate a free-to-air [[television]] station in the [[Ultra High Frequency]] (UHF) spectrum at 510-790 [[MHz]] (from Channel 26 to 60). After a lengthy dispute over unpaid concession fees to the Prime Minister's Office, the government's Public Relations Department took over the station in 2007. Its name was changed to Thai Independent Television (TITV). Following a previously unannounced order of Thailand's Public Relations Department delivered the same day, the station closed on January 15th, 2008. In accordance with the Public Broadcasting Service Act, the channel's frequency was assigned to the [[Thai Public Broadcasting Service]] (Thai PBS).

==History==

===Early years===
The original name of iTV's holding company was Siam Infotainment Company Limited. Its major shareholders were [[Siam Commercial Bank]], the [[Crown Property Bureau]] (the investment organization of King [[Bhumibol]] Adulyadej and Through by Sahacinema Company), and the [[Nation Multimedia Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aseanfocus.com/asiananalysis/article.cfm?articleID=99 ASEAN Focus Group, Australian National University, "The Television Business, Democracy and The Army"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20030702173146/http://www.aseanfocus.com/asiananalysis/article.cfm?articleID=99 |date=2003-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Siam Infotainment won a 30-year concession to run a commercial television station, after offering only approximately $3.3 million USD in royalties (a rival company had offered approximately $17.5 million USD). This irregularity was subject to a government investigation in 1996, but the results of the investigation were never made public.

Established as an independent television station, the company barred any one shareholder from having more than a 10% stake. Free from government control and shareholder liabilities, the station became known for its in-depth coverage of public affairs and [[investigative journalism]].

During the [[East Asian financial crisis]] of 1997, the station faced heavy financial loss. In addition, high concession fees (approximately $708 million USD to be paid over 25 years) threatened to close the station. In 2000, iTV lost 775 million THB (USD $18 million). The [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat]] government worried that if iTV collapsed, shareholders like [[Siam Commercial Bank]] and the [[Crown Property Bureau]] would be adversely affected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/nations/0,8782,98445,00.html Asiaweek, "Taming The Media", 16 February 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; So in order to attract outside capital, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai lifted the 10% limit on share ownership in the station. [[Shin Corporation]], owned by future Thai Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], purchased a large portion of the company's shares for USD $60 million, considered a high price for the ailing company.&lt;ref&gt;Handley, Paul M. "The King Never Smiles" Yale University Press 2006, page 425&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shin Corporation===
[[File:The First Sunrise of 2007 - (Bangkok).jpg|thumb|left|An iTV news van on January 1, 2007, the morning after the [[2006 Bangkok bombings|2006 Bangkok New Year's Eve bombings]]]]
Under new ownership, journalists reported being pressured to downplay negative news about Shin Corporation's then-owner, [[Prime Minister of Thailand|Prime Minister]] [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], and his [[Thai Rak Thai]] party. Twenty-one [[journalist|journalists]] were fired for speaking out. They later won a court case against iTV and were awarded several years of back pay.
&lt;ref&gt;''[[Taipei Times]]'', [http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=41489 Journalists fighting back after being muzzled] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627075134/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=41489 |date=2007-06-27 }}, March 27, 2006 (via AsiaMedia).&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, iTV's news-to-entertainment ratio was about 70/30. In the station's latter years, iTV increased its entertainment-based programming so that about half of its shows were entertainment. Among its popular programs was the Thailand version of the ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' [[reality television|reality TV]] show.

In 2004, iTV was granted permission by an arbitration panel to increase the amount of entertainment programming. Additionally, iTV was required to pay the government only 6 million USD in annual licensing fees, a reduction from the original agreement of 25 million USD.

In June 2006, as a result of iTV's changes in programming, Thailand's Central Administrative Court invalidated the arbitration panel's ruling, saying the news-to-entertainment ratio must be returned to 70/30 and that the broadcaster must pay 2.1 billion dollars in fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/07/headlines/headlines_30018273.php|title=Govt to seek iTV fine of Bt94 bn|publisher=''The Nation''|date=November 7, 2006|accessdate=2008-02-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120125412/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/07/headlines/headlines_30018273.php|archive-date=2008-01-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; iTV contested the court's decision.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bangkok Post]]'', [http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=47792 iTV must again focus on news] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227233215/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=47792 |date=2007-02-27 }}, June 20, 2006, via AsiaMedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media-reform activists in Thailand, such as [[Supinya Klangnarong]] and [[Jon Ungpakorn]], had suggested that the station model itself as a public broadcaster, similar to the [[BBC]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], [[NHK]] or the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]. Proponents believed that a public model would allow iTV to achieve its original mission as an independent public network, free from political intervention and business interests. As Jon Ungpakorn told ''[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]]'', "The goal of founding iTV back in 1995 was to provide a public service via a truly independent network. That ideal should continue to be supported as we shouldn't forget that this network was set up following the 'dark age' of information which led to the [[Black May (1992)|Bloody May]] events of 1992."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]]'', [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/25/headlines/headlines_30007251.php Could BBC model work for iTV?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930024603/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/25/headlines/headlines_30007251.php |date=2007-09-30 }}, June 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand Independent Television (TITV)===
In 2006, Shin Corporation, iTV's majority shareholder, was acquired by [[Temasek Holdings]], the investment company of the [[Singapore|Singaporean]] government. Thai media activists strongly criticized the sale. After the [[2006 Thai coup d'état|2006 military coup]] that ousted Thaksin Shinawatra, [[Thai 2006 interim civilian government|Thailand's interim civilian government]] voiced intentions to take over iTV if it failed to pay 2.8 billion USD in fines.&lt;ref name="GovtAcquisition"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific_business/view/260977/1/.html |title= Thai government moves to take over private TV station|accessdate=2007-02-28 |author=AFP/ls |date=2007-02-28 |publisher= Channel NewsAsia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, Prime Minister [[Surayud Chulanont]] appointed a new executive board consisting exclusively of civil servants. The station was renamed "Thailand Independent Television" (TITV).&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/03/02/headlines/headlines_30028335.php PM endorses new board of iTV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229220813/http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/03/02/headlines/headlines_30028335.php |date=2012-02-29 }}, 2 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[Surayud Chulanont]] announced that the government would acquire the station, intending to hand operations to the Public Relations Department, which already ran TVT Channel 11. Surayud promised that the station would not be taken off the air despite the controversy over concession fees. However, in 2007, the Prime Minister's Office announced that the station would be taken off the air at midnight on 6 March 2007, following the Cabinet's revocation of iTV's concession in early March 2007. Surayud apologized for not keeping his word.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/03/07/politics/politics_30028688.php 'Sorry' sight as govt bungles again] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309194632/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/03/07/politics/politics_30028688.php |date=2007-03-09 }}, 7 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/03/07/headlines/headlines_30028698.php |title=iTV's last hope hinges on court decision |accessdate=2007-03-07 |date=2007-03-07 |publisher=The Nation (Thailand) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309130041/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/03/07/headlines/headlines_30028698.php |archive-date=2007-03-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=28293 |title=Government pulls plug on Thailand's only private television station |accessdate=2007-03-07 |date=2007-03-07 |publisher=MCOT }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Gov't orders iTV off air  | newspaper = Bangkok Post | volume = LXI | issue = 66 | pages = Section 1, Page 1  | date = 2007-03-07 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;  }} (print edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

Then on 7 March 2007, Surayud reversed his decision and ordered that iTV continue broadcasting after the deadline had passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thailand.prd.go.th/the_inside_view.php?id=1814 |title= Thailand Independent Television | accessdate=2007-03-09 |date=2007-03-08 |publisher= Public Relations Department (Thailand)}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transformation into Thai PBS===
On 14 January 2008, Thailand's Government Public Relations Department delivered a non-negotiable letter ordering closure of the station. The station complied, ending the TITV broadcast at 00:08 AM the next day. In accordance with the Public Broadcasting Service Act, the station was transformed into the [[Thai Public Broadcasting Service]] or Thai PBS.&lt;ref name = "launched"&gt;[http://pages.citebite.com/j1w5g4b9qwrm Public TV channel launched], ''Bangkok Post'', January 15, 2008; retrieved from cache 2008-01-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="replaces"&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gotffBDyrMZgwDD7YwTLuj80Mz_Q Thailand replaces programmes on private TV channel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119072200/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gotffBDyrMZgwDD7YwTLuj80Mz_Q |date=2008-01-19 }}, Agence France-Presse, January 14, 2008; retrieved  via Google News 2008-01-25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:China 2006 3-24.jpg|thumb|The hero [[Xiang Yu]] from the [[Peking opera]] ''[[Farewell My Concubine (play)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' is an example of a ''Jing'' character.]]
The '''''Jing''''' is a role type in [[Chinese opera]] for "rough" or "mighty" male characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/867990.shtml|title=Culture Unmasked|newspaper=[[Global Times]]|date=2014-06-29|author=Du Qiongfang}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many genres (such as [[Peking opera]] and [[Cantonese opera]]), this role requires heavy face painting. As a result, it is also known as '''''Hualian''''' ("Painted face"). However, not all characters with painted faces fall into this category,&lt;ref name=Canada&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historymuseum.ca/cantoneseopera/roles-e.shtml|title=Classical Roles and Characters - The Collection of Cantonese Opera Records at the Canadian Museum of Civilization|website=[[Canadian Museum of History]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[Chou (Chinese opera)|Chou]]'' (clowns) being another major painted-face role type.&lt;ref name=ahwen&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Chinese Literature (magazine)|Chinese Literature]]|author=Ah Wen|title=Face Designs in Chinese Opera|pages=95–99|issue=July 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This type of role will entail a forceful character, so a {{transl|zh|Jing}} actor must have a strong voice and be able to exaggerate gestures.&lt;ref name="Players"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ward, Barbara E.| title=Not Merely Players: Drama, Art and Ritual in Traditional China| journal=Man, New Series| year=1979| volume=14| issue=1| pages=18–39| doi=10.2307/2801638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the repertoire of the particular troupe, he will play either primary or secondary roles.&lt;ref name="Wichmann_2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wichmann|first=Elizabeth|title=Listening to Theatre: The Aural Dimension of Beijing Opera|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colour and face design represents the identity and personality of the character.&lt;ref name=Canada/&gt;

==Face design==
Face painting in Chinese theatre probably began with masks, and actors painted their faces as early as 9th-century [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907). During the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368) red and white facial designs were used in opera to distinguish good characters from bad ones. After the 14th century, facial patterns multiplied, and new colors have been introduced.&lt;ref name=ahwen/&gt; [[Peking opera]] now boasts 15 basic facial patterns, but there are over 1000 specific variations. Each design is unique to a specific character. The patterns and coloring are thought to be derived from traditional Chinese color symbolism and divination on the lines of a person's face, which is said to reveal personality. Easily recognizable examples of coloring include:&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Barbara E. (1979) p.20&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Red, denoting uprightness and loyalty (e.g. [[Guan Yu]])
*White, representing evil or crafty characters (e.g. [[Cao Cao]])
*Black, given to characters of soundness and integrity (e.g. [[Bao Zheng]])

Later designs introduced other colors, such as:&lt;ref name=ahwen/&gt;

*Purple, indicating steadfastness and integrity
*Yellow, showing impetuousness and boldness
*Blue, suggesting resolution and daring
*Green, meaning stubborness and hotheadedness
*Gold and silver, used for supernatural beings

To emphasize a character's height and strength, the forehead is generally elongated, with the face design covering the entire face, from the crown to the chin and extending to both ears.&lt;ref name=ahwen/&gt;

==Types==
Three main types of {{transl|zh|Jing}} roles are often seen. These include {{transl|zh|''tongchui''}}, roles that heavily involve singing, {{transl|zh|''jiazi''}}, roles with less emphasis on singing and more on physical performance, and {{transl|zh|''wujing''}}, martial and acrobatic roles.&lt;ref name="tyfo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://china.tyfo.com/int/ent/opera/peking/peking-index.htm|title=Peking Opera|year=2000|publisher=It's China Network - TYFO.COM|author=Unknown Author|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607182457/http://china.tyfo.com/int/ent/opera/peking/peking-index.htm|archivedate=June 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8116">'''Kristin Thompson''' (born 1950) is an American [[film theory|film theorist]] and author whose research interests include the close formal analysis of films, the history of film styles, and "[[quality television]]," a genre akin to [[art film]]. She wrote two scholarly books in the 1980s which used an analytical technique called neoformalism. As well, she has co-authored two widely used film studies textbooks with her husband [[David Bordwell]].

==Career==

===1970s and 1980s===
Thompson earned her master's degree in [[film studies]] at the [[University of Iowa]] (1973) and a Ph.D. in film studies at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. She has held teaching positions at the University of Wisconsin, the University of Iowa, Indiana University, the University of Amsterdam, and the University of Stockholm.

She co-wrote the film textbook, ''Film Art: An Introduction'', with husband [[David Bordwell]]. ''Film Art'', with a tenth edition published in 2013, was originally published in 1979 and has become a standard in the field of film aesthetics. To date, it has been translated into seven languages.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.davidbordwell.net/books/index.php#filmart David Bordwell's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson predominantly relies on an analytical method drawn from [[Russian Formalism]] known as neoformalism. This method formed the basis for her dissertation, which subsequently became her first scholarly book, ''Eisenstein's "Ivan the Terrible": A Neoformalist Analysis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Kristin | last=Thompson | title=Eisenstein's ''Ivan the Terrible'': A Neoformalist Analysis | publisher=Princeton University  Press | year=1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Neoformalism is also the basis for the later, ''Breaking the Glass Armor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Kristin | last=Thompson | title=Breaking the Glass Armor | publisher=Princeton University Press| year=1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s and 2000s===
In 1994, she co-wrote another textbook with Bordwell, ''Film History''. In early 2001 she did a series of lectures at Oxford University. She holds an honorary fellowship in the Department of Communication Arts at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].

===Quality television===
Thompson argues that a small number of television shows stand out as [[quality television]] shows, due to their use of "...a quality pedigree, a large [[ensemble cast]], a series memory, creation of a new [[genre]] through recombination of older ones, self-consciousness, and pronounced tendencies toward the controversial and the realistic."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in the Wilcox and Lavery article on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. Available at: https://web.archive.org/web/20061010121452/http://davidlavery.net/Essays/50_Key_Buffy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that television shows such as ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', '' [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' exhibit traits also found in [[art film]]s, such as psychological realism, narrative complexity, and ambiguous plotlines.

She notes that [[David Lynch]]'s  ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' television series have "...a loosening of causality, a greater emphasis on psychological or anecdotal realism, violations of classical clarity of space and time, explicit authorial comment, and ambiguity." &lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite book|last=King |first=Geoff |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=New Hollywood Cinema: An Introduction |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |edition= |series= |date=2002-03-29|publisher=I B Tauris &amp; Co |location= |isbn=1-86064-750-2 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She compares Lynch's film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' and the television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' and asks "...whether there can be an "art television" comparable to the more familiar "[[art film|art cinema]]." &lt;ref&gt;Kristin Thompson. ''Storytelling in Film and Television. Summary available at: http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:_gjqtGL44gEJ:www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/THOSTF.html+%22art+television%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=126''&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, she points out that series such as '' [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' "...have altered longstanding notions of closure and single authorship", which means that "...television has wrought its own changes in traditional narrative form." She states that ''[[The Simpsons]]'' uses a "...flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the program as a television show."&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;

===''Lord of the Rings''===
In the mid-2000s, Thompson's interest in Hollywood norms led her to write a monograph about the popular fantasy trilogy ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'': ''The Frodo Franchise: The Lord of the Rings and Modern Hollywood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

About Kristin Thompson |last=Thompson |first=Kristin |date=September 5, 2006 |publisher=davidbordwell.net |accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the author's interviews with many of the artists, writers, and business people who participated in the making of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' motion pictures]].

[[File:mamadi.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Mamadi Indoka]] 

== Biography ==
Indoka first encountered the world of cinema in 2002 with a short film shown in Madrid and decided to take up the practice of the seventh art. He studied cinema in Canada and the United States, where he became a director and screenwriter.

In 2005, he wrote and directed his first short, ''Une nuit d'enfer'' (A Night of Hell). In 2006, he wrote and directed another short, ''La Beauté de la mort'' (The Beauty of Death), then, in 2007, directed his first full-length feature, ''32 ans après'' (32 Years After), written by Sebastiao Ndombasi. This film told the story of a man who returns to Angola 32 years after having fled war there, and is treated like a stranger.&lt;ref name=mc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mediacongo.net/publireportage-reportage-10076_mamadi_indoka_seuls_les_producteurs_peuvent_denicher_des_talents_caches.html |language= French |title=Mamadi Indoka : « Seuls les producteurs peuvent dénicher des talents cachés » |date=May 15, 2015 |access-date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he wrote and directed the documentary ''La Pêche artisanale'' (Artisanal Fishing),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africultures.com/films/?no=12972 | title=2008:Pêche artisanale (La)|publisher=Africultures}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010, he directed two shorts: ''Le Sida'' (AIDS), written by Lionel Mwedi Malila, and ''Victime'' (Victim) which he wrote himself. In 2010 he filmed his second full-length feature, ''L'héritage envahi'' (The Invaded Heritage), written and directed by Mamadi Indoka with the support of Congo Films Productions, his production company. This second feature told the story of a heinous crime, an entire family murdered by a trusted bodyguard, who spared only an infant. He abandoned the child in a forest, certain it would die of natural causes. But years later the child, now a grown man, sets outs out to seek revenge.&lt;ref name=mc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fr.allafrica.com/stories/201011050654.html |publisher=allAfrica |date=5 November 2010 |title=Congo-Kinshasa: Tournage du film «L'héritage envahi», l'histoire d'une famille massacrée |access-date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been the earliest Congolese thriller, since it came out a year before ''[[Viva Riva!]]''.

'''Maurice Féaudierre''', better known by his pen-name, '''Serge''', was born in Paris on December 14, 1901. He was a French journalist, chronicler, painter and illustrator, whose main interests were circus, variety, and the Gypsies&amp;mdash;which were the subjects of his many books, paintings and drawings, magazine articles, and radio shows.

He produced and presented over the years several radio shows, such as ''Panorama des Variétés'', ''Les Jeux du Cirque'', ''Jeudi au Cirque'', ''Circoradio'', etc., and his writings have been published in many newspapers and magazines&amp;mdash;''Le Crapouillot'', ''Comœdia'', ''[[Les Nouvelles littéraires]]'' among them. As an artist, he was awarded a ''Grand prix'' at the Exposition internationale de Paris in 1937. He always illustrated his own books.

He was a well-known figure of the "Tout-Paris" of the theater and entertainment scene during his lifetime. He was the President of the French ''Académie du Cirque et du Music-Hall''. Maurice Féaudierre showed a keen interest in magic, and often said that he had worked as a ventriloquist. His writing and speaking styles were famous for their wonderful flourish&amp;mdash;which his recognizable, high-pitched voice made even more spectacular on his radio shows. He died in Paris on October 16, 1992.

'''New York City Ballet''' ('''NYCB''') is a [[ballet company]] founded in 1948 by choreographer [[George Balanchine]]&lt;ref name="JanePhilbinWood"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1083/is_n11_v72/ai_21281339 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051224022748/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1083/is_n11_v72/ai_21281339 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2005-12-24 | title = Memories of Ballet Society and choreographer George Balanchine | author = Jane Philbin Wood | work = [[Dance Magazine]] | date = November 1998 | accessdate = 2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lincoln Kirstein]].&lt;ref name="RaucherNYCB"&gt;{{cite web | author = Laura Raucher | title = Kirstein 100: A Tribute Online Exhibition | url = http://www.nycballet.com/researchers/archive/online.html | publisher = New York City Ballet | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Balanchine and [[Jerome Robbins]] are considered the founding choreographers of the company. [[Léon Barzin]] was the company's first music director.

== History ==
[[File:New York City Ballet in Amsterdam, repetitie New York City Ballet. Choreograaf George Balanchine geeft aanwijzingen.jpg|thumb|New York City Ballet in Amsterdam with [[George Balanchine]]]]

In a 1946 letter, Kirstein stated, "The only justification I have is to enable Balanchine to do exactly what he wants to do in the way he wants to do it."&lt;ref name="macaulay"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/04/books/04Book.html?pagewanted=print Alastair Macaulay, "A Paragon of the Arts, as Both Man and Titan"] (review of Martin Duberman, ''The Worlds of Lincoln Kirstein''), Books of the Times, ''New York Times'', 4 May 2007, accessed 5 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the company's General Director from 1946 to 1989, developing and sustaining it by his organizational and fundraising abilities.&lt;ref name="macaulay"/&gt;

The company was named New York City Ballet in 1948 when it became resident at [[New York City Center|City Center of Music and Drama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70A11FB385D13728DDDAE0A94DE405B8888F1D3 | title = The Dance: City Ballet | publisher = The New York Times | last = Martin | first = John | author-link = John Martin (dance critic) | date = June 27, 1948 | accessdate = 2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50E13FE345F167B93C0A8178BD95F4C8485F9 | title = City Ballet Group in First Program; Works by Balanchine Offered by Unit as Series of Dance Performances Begins | publisher = The New York Times | last = Martin | first = John | author-link = John Martin (dance critic) | date = October 12, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its success was marked by its move to the New York State Theater, now [[David H. Koch Theater]], designed by [[Philip Johnson]] to Balanchine's specifications. City Ballet went on to become the first ballet company in the United States to have two permanent venue engagements: one at [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]]'s [[David H. Koch Theater]] on 63rd Street in [[Manhattan]], and another at the [[Saratoga Performing Arts Center]], in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. The [[School of American Ballet]] (S.A.B.), which Balanchine founded, is the training school of City Ballet.

After the company's move to the State Theater, Balanchine's creativity as a choreographer flourished. He created works that were the basis of the company's repertory until his death in 1983. His vision influenced dance both across the United States and in Europe. He worked closely with choreographer [[Jerome Robbins]], who resumed his connection with the company in 1969 after having produced works for Broadway.

NYCB still has the largest repertoire by far of any American ballet company. It often stages 60 ballets or more in its winter and spring seasons at Lincoln Center each year, and 20 or more in its summer season in Saratoga Springs. City Ballet has performed ''[[The Nutcracker (Balanchine)|The Nutcracker]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (ballet)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', and many more. City Ballet has trained and developed many great dancers since its formation. Many dancers with already developed reputations have also joined the ballet as principal dancers.

{{Category see also|New York City Ballet Salute to Italy}}
In 1960, Balanchine mounted City Ballet's ''Salute to Italy'' with premieres of ''[[Monumentum pro Gesualdo]]'' and ''Variations from Don Sebastian'' (called the ''[[Donizetti Variations]]'' since 1961), as well as performances of his ''[[La Sonnambula (ballet)|La Sonnambula]]'' and [[Lew Christensen]]'s ''[[Con Amore]]''. The performance was repeated in 1968.

=== Stravinsky Festival {{Anchor|Stravinsky Festival}} === &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[NYCB Stravinsky Festival]] and [[New York City Ballet Stravinsky Festival]]. --&gt;
{{Category see also|New York City Ballet Stravinsky Festival}}
[[File:New York State Theater by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|[[David H. Koch Theater]], pre-renovation]]

In 1972, Balanchine offered an eight-day tribute to the composer, his great collaborator, who had died the year before. His programs included twenty-two new works of his own dances, plus works by choreographers [[Todd Bolender]], [[John Clifford (choreographer)|John Clifford]], [[Lorca Massine]], Jerome Robbins, [[Richard Tanner]], and [[John Taras]], as well as repertory ballets by Balanchine and Robbins. Balanchine created ''[[Symphony in Three Movements (ballet)|Symphony in Three Movements]]'', ''[[Duo Concertant]]'', and ''[[Violin Concerto (ballet)|Violin Concerto]]'' for the occasion. He and Robbins co-choreographed and performed in ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)|Pulcinella]]''. Balanchine had produced an earlier Stravinsky festival in 1937 as balletmaster of the [[American Ballet]] while engaged by the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. The composer conducted the April 27th premiere of ''[[Card Party]]''.

=== Ravel Festival {{Anchor|Ravel Festival}} === &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[NYCB Ravel Festival]] and [[New York City Ballet Ravel Festival]]. --&gt;
In 1975, Balanchine paid his respects to the French composer [[Maurice Ravel]] with a two-week ''Hommage à Ravel''. Balanchine, Robbins, [[Jacques d'Amboise (dancer)|Jacques d'Amboise]], and Taras made sixteen new ballets for the occasion. Repertory ballets were performed as well. High points included Balanchine's ''[[Le Tombeau de Couperin]]'' and Robbins' ''[[Mother Goose (ballet)|Mother Goose]]''.

=== Tschaikovsky Festival {{Anchor|Tschaikovsky Festival}} === &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[NYCB Tschaikovsky Festival]] and [[New York City Ballet Tschaikovsky Festival]]. --&gt;
In 1981, Balanchine planned a two-week NYCB festival honoring the Russian composer [[Peter Ilyitch Tschaikovsky]]. Balanchine, [[Joseph Duell]], d'Amboise, [[Peter Martins]], Robbins, and Taras created twelve new dances. In addition to presenting these and repertory ballets, Balanchine re-choreographed his ''[[Mozartiana (ballet)|Mozartiana]]'' from 1933. [[Philip Johnson]] and [[John Burgee]]'s stage setting of translucent tubing was designed to be hung and lit in different architectural configurations throughout the entire festival.&lt;ref name=2013-festivlal&gt;A festival of the same name is planned for 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stravinsky Centennial Celebration ===
{{Category see also|New York City Ballet Stravinsky Centennial Celebration}}
In 1982, Balanchine organized a centennial celebration in honor of his long-time collaborator [[Igor Stravinsky]], during which the City Ballet performed twenty-five ballets set to the composer’s music. Balanchine made three new ballets, ''[[Tango (Balanchine)|Tango]]'', ''[[Élégie (ballet)|Élégie]]'', and ''[[Persephone (ballet)|Persephone]]'', and a new version of ''[[Variations (ballet)|Variations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E2DD163BF932A25755C0A964948260 | title = City Ballet opens 8-day celebration of Stravinsky | publisher = The New York Times | first = Jennifer | last = Dunning | date = June 11, 1982 | accessdate = 2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choreographer died the following year. Balanchine’s 50th Anniversary Celebration was held by the company in 2002.

=== New York State Theater 20-Year Celebration ===
On April 26, 1984, NYCB celebrated the 20th anniversary of the New York State Theater. The program started with [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''Fanfare for a New Theater,'' followed by Stravinsky's arrangement of [[The Star-Spangled Banner]]. The ballets included three of Balanchine's works, [[Serenade (ballet)|Serenade]], [[Violin Concerto (Stravinsky)|Stravinsky Violin Concerto]], and ''Sonatine''; and Jerome Robbins' [[Afternoon of a Faun (Robbins)|Afternoon of a Faun]]. The performers included Maria Calegari, Kyra Nichols, [[Heather Watts]], [[Leonid Kozlov]], Afshin Mofid, [[Patricia McBride]], [[Helgi Tómasson (dancer)|Helgi Tomasson]], Karin von Aroldingen, [[Lourdes Lopez]], Bart Cook, and Joseph Duell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jack | last = Anderson | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/26/arts/city-ballet-a-20-year-celebration.html | title = City Ballet: A 20-Year Celebration | publisher = The New York Times | date = April 26, 1984 | accessdate = 2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peter Martins===
After Balanchine's death in 1983, Peter Martins was selected as balletmaster of the company.  After 30 years, Martins was judged to have maintained the New York City Ballet's financial security and the musicality and performance level of the dancers, but he has not emphasized the Balanchine style to the extent that many observers expected he would. Martins retired from his position in 2018.&lt;ref name=Sulcas/&gt;

==== American Music Festival ====
{{Category see also|New York City Ballet American Music Festival}}
 
For the company's 40th anniversary, Martins held an American Music Festival, having commissioned dances from choreographers [[Laura Dean (choreographer)|Laura Dean]], [[Eliot Feld]], [[William Forsythe (dancer)|William Forsythe]], [[Lar Lubovitch]], and [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]]. He also presented ballets by [[George Balanchine]] and Robbins. The programs included world premieres of more than twenty dances. Martins contributed ''[[Barber Violin Concerto]]'', ''[[Black and White (ballet)|Black and White]]'', ''[[The Chairman Dances (ballet)|The Chairman Dances]]'', ''[[A Fool for You (ballet)|A Fool for You]]'', ''[[Fred and George (ballet)|Fred and George]]'', ''[[Sophisticated Lady (ballet)|Sophisticated Lady]]'', ''[[Tanzspiel]]'', ''[[Tea-Rose]]'', and ''[[The Waltz Project]]''.&lt;ref name="2013-festivlal"/&gt;

== The New York City Ballet Orchestra ==
The 66-member NYCB Orchestra is an important symphonic institution in its own right, having played for virtually all of the thousands of performances NYCB has given over the decades.  It is one of the most versatile orchestras in the world, on any given week performing perhaps three or four times the repertoire that another symphony might be expected to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York City Ballet Orchestra Musicians |url=https://nycbo.org/ |publisher=nycbo.org|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Principal players of the orchestra also perform the majority of the concertos, other solos, and chamber music in the NYCB repertory as well. The orchestra accompanies the ballet on all of its North American tours, and while the ballet uses local orchestras on its international tours, members of the NYCB Orchestra often go along as soloists or extras.

Besides the members of the orchestra, the NYCB has six pianists on full-time staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYCB Orchestra|url=http://www.nycballet.com/Discover/Orchestra.aspx|website=NYCB|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They all perform in the pit with the orchestra on a regular basis.

The NYCB Orchestra also occasionally accompanies other dance companies when they visit The David H. Koch Theater from other cities. These engagements have included the Australian Ballet in the spring of 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/arts/dance/swan-lake-by-australian-ballet-at-koch-theater.html | publisher=The New York Times | title=‘Swan Lake' by Australian Ballet at Koch Theater | accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the San Francisco Ballet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/arts/dance/san-francisco-ballet-in-ratmansky-and-morris-works.html?ref=dance | publisher=The New York Times | title=San Francisco Ballet in Ratmansky and Morris Works |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the fall of 2013.

Over the decades the NYCB Orchestra has welcomed other noted orchestral musicians to collaborate on special performances. Included among this group was [[John Serry Sr.]], who served as the lead orchestral accordionist during the NYCB's 20th anniversary season in the premiere of Jacques d' Amboise's ''Tchaikovsky Suite'' (1969).

=== Music director ===
[[Andrew Litton]] was appointed to the position on December 16, 2014, and started in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Litton to Lead New York City Ballet Orchestra |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/arts/dance/andrew-litton-to-lead-new-york-city-ballet-orchestra.html |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6963">The '''New Zealand Film Archive''' was established in 1981.  On 1 August 2014 the archive was amalgamated with Sound Archives Ngā Taonga Kōrero and the [[Television New Zealand Archive]] to form [[Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision]].

==2010 lost film recovery==

In 2010, a collection of 75 previously thought to be lost American [[silent films]], were [[list of rediscovered films|discovered]] in the New Zealand Film Archive.&lt;ref name="nytlong"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/movies/07silent.html |title=Trove of Long-Lost Silent Films Returns to America|accessdate=2010-06-06|work=The New York Times | first=Dave | last=Kehr | date=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="filmpreservation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmpreservation.org/preserved-films/new-zealand-project-films-highlights |title=New Zealand Project Films: Highlights|accessdate=2010-06-06|work=filmpreservation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The films dated from 1898 to 1929 and were previously thought to be [[lost film]]s.&lt;ref name="TAN"&gt;[http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Silent-films-in-the-spotlight/23587 Silent films in the spotlight] The Art Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background and restoration===

During the time period that the films were performed films were shipped to countries along a "distribution line" format, with [[New Zealand]] often being the last place the films would be shipped. Because of the high cost of transport during this time and the flammability of the early film stock, most of the films would not be shipped back to the United States and were stored into government archives,&lt;ref name="TAN" /&gt; were destroyed,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127530994 A Happy Homecoming For Long-Lost Silent Films] NPR&lt;/ref&gt; or were given or sold to private owners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-09-09/long-lost-movie-screens-again/2254510 Long-lost movie screens again] ABC News&lt;/ref&gt;

The films were discovered during the visit of Brian Meacham, a Los Angeles [[film preservationist]], to the archive. Meacham was curious as to what films the archive held, upon which it was discovered that the archive held a large amount of early American films. The New Zealand Film Archive's Steve Russell said "It's one of the rare cases where the tyranny of distance has worked in our and the films' favour".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newzealand.com/travel/media/press-releases/2010/6/film_us-film-treasures-sent-home_press-release.cfm US film treasures surface in New Zealand] NewZealand.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to export the films back to the United States for restoration, the movies have had to be transported in U.N.-approved steel barrels in incremental doses.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/movies/07silent.html Long-Lost Silent Films Return to America] New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the films had begun to deteriorate, with film preservationist Annette Melville saying "About a quarter of the films are in advanced nitrate decay and the rest have good image quality, though they are badly shrunken".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10262791 Rare silent movie haul to be restored] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films discovered===

Of the 75 films discovered in the New Zealand archive, some of the more notable examples were John Ford's 1927 film [[Upstream (film)|''Upstream'']] and the 1923 film [[Maytime (1923 film)|''Maytime'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=25494 "Astonishing" collection of old US movies discovered in Wellington] Wellington Scoop&lt;/ref&gt; It was also noted by the ''[[New York Times]]'' that many of the films that were recovered "underline the major contribution made by women to early cinema".&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; [[Sony]] has assumed the costs for the restoration of ''[[Mary of the Movies]]''.

The Hitchcock film ''[[The White Shadow (film)|The White Shadow]]'' was discovered in the collection,&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2011/08/04/lost-hitchcock-film-the-white-shadow-discovered-in-new-zealand/ Hitchcock's 'The White Shadow' Discovered] Wall Street Journal Blog&lt;/ref&gt; mislabeled as the movie ''[[Twin Sisters (1934 film)|Twin Sisters]]'' and lacked a title credit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scpr.org/news/2011/08/05/28049/film-archivists-find-early-hitchcock-film/ Film archivists find early Hitchcock film] SCPR&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of this film was named as one of [[Movies.com|Movies.com's]] "Biggest Surprises of 2011".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.movies.com/movie-news/2011-biggest-surprises-in-film/5983 The Year in Film: 2011's Biggest Surprises] Movies.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American silent films ===

The archive has many silent American films that had been shipped to New Zealand at the time of their release, but were thought not worth the expense of shipping back to the United States after they ran in theaters.&lt;ref name="nytlong"/&gt; The films were supposed to be destroyed after being sent to New Zealand and seen there at the end of their distribution run, but some were stashed away instead, then later put into the archive. Only about 20 percent of films from the silent era were still in existence as of 2010.&lt;ref name=king&gt;King, Susan, [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-rare-film-20100607,0,4860101.story "Silent film treasures to be preserved"], June 7, 2010, ''Los Angeles Times'', retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation has a strong commitment to repatriating old films to their country of origin. In 2009, the archive agreed with the (American) [[National Film Preservation Foundation]] to repatriate 75 silent American films, all rare or previously thought by American archivists and scholars to be lost (the archive continues to hold many other silent-era American films). About 70 percent of the copies were complete. The films, all on highly volatile and dangerous [[nitrate stock]], were to be shipped back to the United States for restoration and copying, except for ''[[Upstream (film)|Upstream]]'', a 1927 film by [[John Ford]], which was determined to be so precious that transportation could not be risked before it was restored and copied in New Zealand. Other films in the cache include ''Mary of the Movies'' (1923), the earliest [[C.B.C Film Sales]] ([[Columbia Pictures]]) feature film known to have survived,&lt;ref name="nytlong"/&gt; ''Maytime'' (1923; starring [[Clara Bow]]); the first surviving film [[Mabel Normand]] directed (and starred in); an episode of the serial ''[[The Active Life of Dolly of the Dailies]]'', as well as industrial films, documentaries and newsreels. The agreement to repatriate the films came after an American film preservationist from the [[Academy Film Archive]] visited the New Zealand archives while on vacation and began discussing the New Zealand institution's holdings with archivists there.&lt;ref name=king/&gt;

[[File:Faure1907.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=head and shoulders shot of an elderly man with white hair and a splendid white moustache|Fauré in 1907]]
The French composer [[Gabriel Fauré]] (1845–1924) wrote in many genres, including songs, chamber music, orchestral pieces, and choral works.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; His compositions for piano, written between the 1860s and the 1920s,{{#tag:ref|Opus numbers and dates of composition are taken from Morrison, pp. 3–5. It is not always possible to give precise dates of composition for the early works.&lt;ref&gt;Orledge, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Manuscripts have been lost, and Fauré frequently reused thematic material from an unsuccessful or incomplete work.&lt;ref name="Nectouxpp"&gt;Nectoux (1991), pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} include some of his best known works.

Fauré's major sets of piano works are thirteen [[nocturne]]s, thirteen [[barcarolle]]s, six [[impromptu]]s, and four valses-caprices. These sets were composed during several decades in his long career, and display the change in his style from uncomplicated youthful charm to a final enigmatic, but sometimes fiery introspection, by way of a turbulent period in his middle years. His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are ''Romances sans paroles'', [[piano ballad|Ballade]] in F{{music|sharp}} major, [[Mazurka]] in B{{music|flat}} major, ''Thème et variations'' in C{{music|sharp}} major, and ''Huit pièces brèves''.  For [[piano four hands|piano duet]], Fauré composed the ''[[Dolly (Fauré)|Dolly Suite]]'' and, together with his friend and former pupil [[André Messager]], an exuberant parody of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] in the short suite ''Souvenirs de Bayreuth''.

Much of Fauré's piano music is difficult to play, but is rarely virtuosic in style. The composer disliked showy display, and the predominant characteristic of his piano music is a classical restraint and understatement.

==Introduction==
Although for much of his career he made his living as a church organist, Fauré greatly preferred the piano.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; He never underestimated the challenges in composing for the instrument; he wrote, "In piano music there's no room for padding – one has to pay cash and make it consistently interesting. It's perhaps the most difficult genre of all."&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 380 (2004 1st paperback edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Although his publishers insisted on descriptive titles, Fauré said that his own preference would be for utilitarian labels such as "Piano piece No X". His works for the piano are marked by a classical French lucidity;&lt;ref name=baker&gt;Slonimsky, Nicholas. [http://bakr.alexanderstreet.com/View/665229/Highlight/faure#faure1 "Fauré, Gabriel (-Urbain)",] ''Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians'', Schirmer Reference, New York, 2001, accessed 8 September 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was unimpressed by pianistic display, commenting of keyboard virtuosi, "the greater they are, the worse they play me."&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; Even a virtuoso such as [[Franz Liszt]] said that he found Fauré's music hard to play: at his first attempt he said to Fauré, "I've run out of fingers".&lt;ref name="Nectoux"&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Fauré visited Liszt in Zürich in July 1882. The elder composer played one of his own compositions and then began Fauré's [[Ballade (classical music)|Ballade]] in F{{music|sharp}} major. After a few bars he said that he had run out of fingers, and asked Fauré to play the rest of the piece to him. Nectoux and Duchen speculate that Liszt may have had difficulty in reading the manuscript or perhaps wanted to hear how Fauré himself would play.;&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux (1991), p.51; and Duchen (2000), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Jones and Morrison simply state that Liszt found the music "too difficult".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 51; and Morrison, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}  Fauré's years as an organist influenced the way he laid out his keyboard works, often using [[Arpeggio|arpeggiated]] figures, with themes distributed between the two hands, requiring fingerings more natural for organists than pianists.&lt;ref name="Jones 51"&gt;Jones, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency may have been even stronger because Fauré was [[ambidextrous]], and he was not always inclined to follow the convention that the melody is in the right hand and the accompaniment in the left. His old friend and former teacher [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] wrote to him in 1917, "Ah! if there is a god for the left hand, I should very much like to know him and make him an offering when I am disposed to play your music; the 2nd Valse-Caprice is terrible in this respect; I have however managed to get to the end of it by dint of absolute determination."&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux and Jones, pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;

As a man, Fauré was said to possess "that mysterious gift that no other can replace or surpass: charm",&lt;ref name=m14&gt;Morrison, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; and charm is a conspicuous feature of many of his early compositions.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; His early piano works are influenced in style by [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]],&lt;ref name="n49" /&gt; and throughout his life he composed piano works using similar titles to those of Chopin, notably [[nocturnes]] and [[barcarolle]]s.&lt;ref name=m12/&gt; An even greater influence was [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], whose piano music Fauré loved more than any other.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of ''[[The Record Guide]]'' (1955) wrote that Fauré learnt restraint and beauty of surface from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], tonal freedom and long melodic lines from Chopin, "and from Schumann, the sudden felicities in which his development sections abound, and those codas in which whole movements are briefly but magically illuminated."&lt;ref&gt;Sackville-West, pp. 263–64&lt;/ref&gt; When Fauré was a student at the [[Louis Niedermeyer|École Niedermeyer]] his tutor had introduced him to new concepts of harmony, no longer outlawing certain chords as "[[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]]".{{#tag:ref|In particular, [[Seventh chord|seventh]] and [[ninth]] chords were no longer considered dissonant, and the [[mediant]] could be altered without changing the [[Musical mode|mode]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Nectoux, Jean-Michel. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09366 "Fauré, Gabriel (Urbain)"], ''Grove Online'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 21 August 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} By using unresolved mild discords and colouristic effects, Fauré anticipated the techniques of [[Impressionist music|Impressionist]] composers.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

In later years Fauré's music was written under the shadow of the composer's increasing deafness, becoming gradually less charming and more austere, marked by what the composer [[Aaron Copland]] called "intensity on a background of calm."&lt;ref name=m14/&gt; The critic Bryce Morrison has noted that pianists frequently prefer to play the accessible earlier piano works, rather than the later music, which expresses "such private passion and isolation, such alternating anger and resignation" that listeners are left uneasy.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The Fauré scholar [[Jean-Michel Nectoux]] writes:
{{quote|Fauré's stylistic evolution can&amp;nbsp;... be observed in his works for piano. The elegant and captivating first pieces, which made the composer famous, show the influence of Chopin, Saint-Saëns, and Liszt. The lyricism and complexity of his style in the 1890s are evident in the Nocturnes nos. 6 and 7, the Barcarolle no. 5 and the Thème et variations. Finally, the stripped-down style of the final period informs the last nocturnes (nos.10–13), the series of great barcarolles (nos. 8–11) and the astonishing Impromptu no. 5.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;|}}

==Nocturnes==
[[File:Fauré-1875.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=head and shoulders shot of a young man with medium length hair and a substantial moustache|Fauré in 1875]]
The nocturnes, along with the barcarolles, are generally regarded as the composer's greatest piano works.&lt;ref name=m12&gt;Morrison, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Fauré greatly admired the music of Chopin, and was happy to compose in forms and patterns established by the earlier composer.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Morrison notes that Fauré's nocturnes follow Chopin's model, contrasting serene outer sections with livelier or more turbulent central episodes.&lt;ref name=m12/&gt; The composer's son Philippe commented that the nocturnes "are not necessarily based on rêveries or on emotions inspired by the night. They are lyrical, generally impassioned pieces, sometimes anguished or wholly elegiac."&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Nectoux (1991), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

;Nocturne No 1 in E{{music|flat}} minor, Op 33/1 (c.1875)
Nectoux rates the first nocturne as one of the best of the composer's early works.&lt;ref name=n49&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; It is dedicated, like Fauré's song [[Trois mélodies, Op.7 (Fauré)|"Après un rêve"]], to his friend and early patron Marguerite Baugnies.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison calls the piece "cloistered and elegiac." Though published as the composer's Op 33/1 in 1883, it was written considerably earlier.&lt;ref name="Nectouxpp" /&gt; It opens with a slow, pensive melody, followed by a more agitated second theme and another melody in C major, and ends with the return of the opening theme.&lt;ref name=b15&gt;Bricard, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The pianist and academic [[Sally Pinkas]] writes that the work contains many hallmarks of Fauré's style, including "undulating rhythms, syncopation of the accompaniment against the melody and layered textures are already in evidence."&lt;ref name=p5&gt;Pinkas, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

;Nocturne No 2 in B major, Op 33/2 (c.1880)
The second nocturne opens with a bell-like passage, ''andantino espressivo'', recalling – although Fauré said it was unconscious – the sound of distant bells that he heard frequently when a boy.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|[[Roy Howat]] in a 2009 study of French piano music notes that bell ''motifs'' also occur in the first, fourth, seventh, eighth, and thirteenth nocturnes, the first prélude, the seventh barcarolle, and the Thème et variations.&lt;ref&gt;Howat (2009), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Nectoux singles out "the light footed episode in alternating fifths and sixths" and its extremely delicate passagework, and points to the influence of Fauré's former teacher Saint-Saëns in the ''allegro ma non troppo'' [[toccata]] section.&lt;ref name="n49"/&gt; Saint-Saëns himself declared the piece "absolutely entrancing."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

;Nocturne No 3 in A{{music|flat}} major, Op 33/3 (c.1882)
In the third nocturne, Morrison notes that the composer's fondness for syncopation is at its gentlest, "nostalgia lit by passion."&lt;ref name=m12/&gt; Like its predecessors, it is in tripartite form. An expansive melody with syncopated left-hand accompaniment leads into a middle section in which a ''dolcissimo'' theme metamorphoses into bursts of passion.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkas, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The return of the opening section is concluded by a gentle [[coda (music)|coda]] that introduces new harmonic subtleties.&lt;ref name=m12/&gt;

;Nocturne No 4 in E{{music|flat}} major, Op 36 (c.1884)
The fourth nocturne, dedicated to the Comtesse de Mercy-Argenteau, contrasts a lyrical opening section and an episode in E{{music|flat}} minor with a sombre theme recalling the tolling of a bell. The first theme returns and is followed by a short coda.&lt;ref name=b15/&gt; The pianist [[Alfred Cortot]], generally a great admirer of Fauré, found the piece "rather too satisfied with its languor."&lt;ref name=m12/&gt;

;Nocturne No 5 in B{{music|flat}} major, Op 37 (c.1884)
By contrast with its predecessor, the fifth nocturne is more animated, with unexpected shifts into remote keys.&lt;ref name=m12/&gt; Nectoux writes of its undulating outline, and the "almost improvisatory, questioning character" of the opening.&lt;ref name="Nectoux" /&gt;

;Nocturne No 6 in D{{music|flat}} major, Op 63 (1894)
The sixth nocturne, dedicated to Eugène d'Eichthal, is widely held to be one of the finest of the series. Cortot said, "There are few pages in all music comparable to these."&lt;ref name=copland/&gt;  Morrison calls it "among the most rich and eloquent of all Fauré's piano works."&lt;ref name=m12/&gt; The pianist and writer Nancy Bricard calls it "one of the most passionate and moving works in piano literature."&lt;ref name=b15/&gt; Fauré wrote it after a six-year break from composing for the piano. The piece begins with an emotional, outpouring phrase, with echoes of Fauré's song cycle  ''[[La bonne chanson (Fauré)|La bonne chanson]]''.&lt;ref name=k37/&gt; The second theme, at first seemingly tranquil, has what the composer [[Charles Koechlin]] calls a persistent inquietude, emphasised by the syncopated accompaniment.&lt;ref name=k37/&gt; The initial theme returns, and is followed by a substantial development of a gentle, contemplative melody. A recapitulation of the principal theme takes the piece to its conclusion.&lt;ref name=k37/&gt; Copland wrote that it was with this work that Fauré first fully emerged from the shadow of Chopin, and he said of the piece, "The breath and dignity of the opening melody, the restless C sharp minor section which follows (with the peculiar syncopated harmonies so often and so well used by Fauré), the graceful fluidity of the third idea: all these elements are brought to a stormy climax in the short development section; then, after a pause, comes the return of the consoling first page."&lt;ref name=copland&gt;Copland, Aaron. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/738475 "Gabriel Fauré, a Neglected Master"]. ''The Musical Quarterly'', October 1924, pp. 573–586, Oxford University Press, accessed 20 August 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Nocturne No 7 in C{{music|sharp}} minor, Op 74 (1898)
The seventh nocturne departs from the A–B–A form of Fauré's earlier nocturnes; in Pinkas's view is it constructed more like a [[Ballade (classical music)|ballade]] than a nocturne.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkas, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; It opens with a slow (''molto lento'') theme of harmonic ambiguity, followed by a second theme, equally ambiguous in key, though nominally in D major. The central section is in F{{music|sharp}} major, and the re-emergence of the first theme brings the piece to a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1993), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison finds in this piece a sense of bleakness, and of the composer's struggle against despair.&lt;ref name=m12/&gt; Pinkas, however, regards the work as a "contrast between ambiguity and joy, ending in reassurance."&lt;ref&gt;Pinkas, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes known as the "English" nocturne, having been composed while Fauré was staying in the UK, and being dedicated to the English pianist [[Adela Maddison]].&lt;ref&gt;Orledge, pp. 95 and 303&lt;/ref&gt;
;Nocturne No 8 in D{{music|flat}} major, Op 84/8 (1902)
Fauré did not intend the eighth nocturne to appear under that designation. His publisher collected eight short piano pieces together and published them as ''8 pièces brèves'', allocating each of them a title unauthorised by the composer. The nocturne, the last piece in the set of eight, is shorter and less complex than its immediate predecessor, consisting of a song-like main theme with a delicate semiquaver accompaniment in the left hand.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;Anderson (1993), pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fauré-9th-Nocturne.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=title page of sheet music|Title page of the Ninth nocturne, 1908]]
;Nocturne No 9 in B minor, Op 97 (1908)
The ninth nocturne, dedicated to Cortot's wife, Clotilde Bréal, is the first of three that share a directness and sparseness in contrast with the more elaborate structures and textures of their predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux (1991), pp. 381 and 584&lt;/ref&gt; The left-hand accompaniment to the melodic line is simple and generally unvaried, and the harmony looks forward to later composers of the 20th century, using a [[whole tone scale]]. Most of the piece is inward-looking and pensive, presaging the style of Fauré's final works, although it ends optimistically in a major key.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkas, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

;Nocturne No 10 in E minor, Op 99 (1908)
Like its immediate predecessor, the tenth nocturne is on a smaller scale than those of Fauré's middle period. In contrast with the ninth, however, the tenth is darker and angrier. The composer applies the A–B–A form less rigorously than in earlier nocturnes, and the opening bars of the piece recur intermittently throughout, eventually building to a fierce climax, described by Morrison as "a slow central climb&amp;nbsp;... that inhabits a world of nightmare."&lt;ref name=m14/&gt; The piece ends with a calm coda.&lt;ref name=p10&gt;Pinkas, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; It is dedicated to Madame Brunet-Lecomte.&lt;ref name=p80/&gt;

;Nocturne No 11 in F{{music|sharp}} minor, Op 104/1 (1913)
The eleventh nocturne was written in memory of Noémi Lalo; her widower, [[Pierre Lalo]], was a music critic and a friend and supporter of Fauré.&lt;ref name=b16&gt;Bricard, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison suggests that its funereal effect of tolling bells may also reflect the composer's own state of anguish, with deafness encroaching.&lt;ref name=m14/&gt; The melodic line is simple and restrained, and except for a passionate section near the end is generally quiet and elegiac.&lt;ref name=p10/&gt;

;Nocturne No 12 in E minor, Op 107 (1915)
With the twelfth nocturne Fauré returned to the scale and complexity of his middle-period works, but both melodically and harmonically it is much harder to comprehend. There are deliberate dissonances and harmonic ambiguities that Pinkas describes as "taking tonality to its limit while still maintaining a single key."&lt;ref name=p11&gt;Pinkas, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison writes that "the ecstatic song of No 6 is transformed in a central section where lyricism is soured by dissonance, held up, as it were, to a distorting mirror."&lt;ref name=m14/&gt; The work is in Fauré's customary nocturne form, A–B–A, but with a reiteration of the material of the second section, harmonically transformed, followed by a coda that draws on material from the opening section.&lt;ref name=p11/&gt;

;Nocturne No 13 in B minor, Op 119 (1921)
Fauré scholars are generally agreed that the last nocturne – which was the last work he wrote for the piano – is among the greatest of the set. Nectoux writes that along with the sixth, it is "incontestably the most moving and inspired of the series."&lt;ref name=n438&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 438&lt;/ref&gt; Bricard calls it "the most inspired and beautiful in the series."&lt;ref name=b16/&gt; For Pinkas, the work "achieves a perfect equilibrium between late-style simplicity and full-textured passionate expression."&lt;ref name=p11/&gt; The work opens in a "pure, almost rarefied atmosphere" (Nectoux), with a "tone of noble, gentle supplication&amp;nbsp;... imposing gravity and&amp;nbsp;... rich expressive four part writing."&lt;ref name=n438/&gt; This is followed by an ''allegro'', "a true middle section in a virtuoso manner, ending in a bang" (Pinkas).&lt;ref name=p11/&gt; The repeat of the opening section completes the work.&lt;ref name=p11/&gt;

==Barcarolles==
[[File:Fauré-in-Venice.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Victorian photograph of a Venetian palazzo with a group of people on the main balcony|Long shot of Fauré with [[Winnaretta Singer]] and others on the balcony of the Palazzo Volkoff, Venice, 1891]]
Barcarolles were originally folk songs sung by [[gondola|Venetian gondoliers]]. In Morrison's phrase, Fauré's use of the term was more convenient than precise.&lt;ref name=m12/&gt; Fauré was not attracted by fanciful titles for musical pieces, and maintained that he would not use even such generic titles as "barcarolle" if his publishers did not insist. His son Philippe recalled, "he would far rather have given his Nocturnes, Impromptus, and even his Barcarolles the simple title Piano Piece no. so-and-so."&lt;ref name="Nectoux_b"&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, following the precedents of Chopin and most conspicuously Mendelssohn,{{#tag:ref| Mendelssohn's ''[[Songs Without Words]]'' contain three "Venetian Gondola Songs", Opp 19/6, 30/6 and 62/5. Some early editions of the score give the first of these the title "Barcarolle".&lt;ref&gt;Hinson, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Fauré made extensive use of the barcarolle, in what his biographer Jessica Duchen calls "an evocation of the rhythmic rocking and lapping of water around appropriately lyrical melodies."&lt;ref name=d5&gt;Duchen (2011), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Fauré's ambidexterity is reflected in the layout of many of his piano works, notably in the barcarolles, where the main melodic line is often in the middle register, with the accompaniments in the high treble part of the keyboard as well as in the bass.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Duchen likens the effect of this in the barcarolles to that of a reflection shining up through the water.&lt;ref name=d5/&gt;

Like the nocturnes, the barcarolles span nearly the whole of Fauré's composing career, and they similarly display the evolution of his style from the uncomplicated charm of the early pieces to the withdrawn and enigmatic quality of the late works.&lt;ref name=m10&gt;Morrison, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; All are written with compound time signatures (6/8 or 9/8), except number 7, which is in 6/4.

;Barcarolle No 1 in A minor, Op 26 (1880)
The first barcarolle was dedicated to the pianist Caroline de Serres (Mme. [[Caroline Montigny-Rémaury]]) and premiered by Saint-Saëns at a concert of the [[Société Nationale de Musique]] in 1882.&lt;ref name=a2&gt;Anderson (1996), pp. 3–5&lt;/ref&gt; The piece begins with an uncomplicated melody in a traditional lilting Venetian style in [[time signature|6/8 time]].&lt;ref name=m11&gt;Morrison, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; It develops into a more elaborate form before the introduction of the second theme, in which the melodic line is given in the middle register with delicate arpeggiated accompaniments in the treble and bass.&lt;ref name=d6&gt;Duchen (2011), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison comments that even in this early work, conventional sweetness is enlivened by subtle dissonance.&lt;ref name=m11/&gt;

;Barcarolle No 2 in G major, Op 41 (1885)
The second barcarolle, dedicated to the pianist Marie Poitevin,&lt;ref name=a2/&gt; is a longer and more ambitious work than the first, with what Morrison calls an Italianate profusion of detail.&lt;ref name=m11/&gt; Duchen writes of the work as complex and questing, harmonically and melodically, and points to the influence of Saint-Saëns, Liszt and even, unusually for Fauré, of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]].&lt;ref name=d6/&gt; The work opens in 6/8 time like the first, but Fauré varies the time signature to an unexpected [[time signature|9/8]] in the middle of the piece.&lt;ref name=a2/&gt;

;Barcarolle No 3 in G{{music|flat}} major, Op 42 (1885)
The third barcarolle is dedicated to Henriette Roger-Jourdain, wife of Fauré's friend, the painter {{ill|Roger-Joseph Jourdain|fr}}. It opens with a simple phrase that is quickly elaborated into trills reminiscent of Chopin.&lt;ref name=d6/&gt; The middle section, like that of the first, keeps the melody in the middle register with delicate arpeggiated ornaments above and below. The pianist [[Marguerite Long]] said that these ornaments "crown the theme like sea foam."&lt;ref name=m11/&gt;

;Barcarolle No 4 in A{{music|flat}} major, Op 44 (1886)
One of the best-known of the set,&lt;ref name=k37&gt;Koechlin, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; the fourth barcarolle is "tuneful, quite short, perhaps more direct than the others." (Koechlin).&lt;ref name=k37/&gt;

[[File:Gabriel Fauré 1896.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=a middle-aged man in 19th century dress looking at the camera; he has greying hair and a large moustache|Fauré in the mid-1890s]]
;Barcarolle No 5 in F{{music|sharp}} minor, Op 66 (1894)
Dedicated to [[Vincent d'Indy|Mme la Baronne V. d'Indy]],&lt;ref name=p129/&gt; the fifth barcarolle was written after a five-year period in which Fauré composed nothing for the piano. Orledge calls it powerful, agitated and virile.&lt;ref name=o92/&gt; It is the first of Fauré's piano works in which there are no identifiable sections; its changes are in metre, not in tempo.&lt;ref&gt;Orledge, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

;Barcarolle No 6 in E{{music|flat}} major, Op 70 (1896)
Koechlin brackets the sixth and seventh of the set together as a contrasting pair. Both pieces show "an economy of writing", the sixth "more moderate and tranquil in expression".&lt;ref name=k37/&gt; The Fauré scholar [[Roy Howat]] writes of a "sensuous insouciance" with an underlying virtuosity and wit under the "deceptively nonchalant surface".&lt;ref name=h155/&gt;

;Barcarolle No 7 in D minor, Op 90 (1905)
The seventh barcarolle contrasts with its predecessor in being more restless and sombre, recalling Fauré's "Crépuscule" from  his song cycle ''[[La chanson d'Ève]]''.&lt;ref name=k38&gt;Koechlin, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

;Barcarolle No 8 in D{{music|flat}} major, Op 96 (1906)
Dedicated to Suzanne Alfred-Bruneau,&lt;ref name=p79&gt;Phillips, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; the eighth barcarolle opens in with a cheerful theme, which soon gives way to melancholy.&lt;ref name=k38/&gt; The second episode, in C{{music|sharp}} minor, marked ''cantabile'', is succeeded by an abrupt ending with a ''fortissimo'' chord.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;

;Barcarolle No 9 in A minor, Op 101 (1909)
The ninth barcarolle, in Koechlin's view, "recalls, as in a hazy remoteness, the happiness of the past".&lt;ref name=k38/&gt; Nectoux writes that it consists of "a series of harmonic or [[polyphonic]] variations on a strange, sombre, syncopated theme, whose monotony recalls some sailor's song".&lt;ref name=n382&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 382&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Faure-manuscript-11th-barcarolle.jpg|thumb|right|alt=musical manuscript|Manuscript of the opening of the eleventh barcarolle]]
;Barcarolle No 10 in A minor, Op 104/2 (1913)
Dedicated to Madame Léon Blum,&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; the tenth barcarolle stays more closely within conventional tonality than its predecessor, "with a certain sedate gravity&amp;nbsp;... the monotony appropriate to a grey evening" (Koechlin).&lt;ref name=k38/&gt; The melancholy theme is reminiscent of Mendelssohn's Venetian themes from ''Songs Without Words'', but is developed in a way characteristic of Fauré, with "increasingly animated rhythms and, at certain points, excessively complex textures" (Nectoux).&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

;Barcarolle No 11 in G minor, Op 105 (1913)
Dedicated to Laura, daughter of the composer [[Isaac Albéniz]].&lt;ref name=p79/&gt; The eleventh and twelfth of the set can be viewed as another contrasting pair.&lt;ref name=k38/&gt; The eleventh is severe in mood and in rhythm, reflecting the prevailing austerity of Fauré's later style.&lt;ref name=k38/&gt;

;Barcarolle No 12 in E{{music|flat}} major, Op 106bis (1915)
Dedicated to [[Louis Diémer]],&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; the twelfth barcarolle is an ''allegretto giocoso''. It opens in what was by now for Fauré a rare uncomplicated theme, in the traditional Venetian manner, but is developed in more subtle rhythms.&lt;ref name=k38/&gt; Despite the increasing complexity of the polyphonic lines, Fauré keeps the melody prominent, and the piece ends with it transformed into "a theme of almost triumphal character" (Nectoux).&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 391&lt;/ref&gt;

;Barcarolle No 13 in C major, Op 116 (1921)
The last of the set is dedicated to Magda Gumaelius.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, p.  118&lt;/ref&gt; Koechlin writes of it: "bare, superficially  almost dry, but at heart most expressive with that deep nostalgia for vanished bright horizons: sentiments that the composer suggests in passing rather than comments on in loquacious or theatrical oratory; he seemed to desire to preserve the soothing and illusory serenity of the mirage."&lt;ref name=k38/&gt;

==Impromptus==
;Impromptu No 1 in E{{music|flat}} major, Op 25 (1881)
Cortot compared the first impromptu to a rapid barcarolle, redolent of "sunlit water", combining "stylised coquetry and regret".&lt;ref name=m8/&gt;

;Impromptu No 2 in F minor, Op 31 (1883)
Dedicated to Mlle Sacha de Rebina,&lt;ref name=p79/&gt; the second impromptu maintains an airy [[tarantella]] rhythm.&lt;ref name=k33/&gt; It is scored less richly than the first of the set, giving it a lightness of texture.&lt;ref name=m8/&gt;

;Impromptu No 3 in A{{music|flat}} major, Op 34 (1883)
The third impromptu is the most popular of the set.&lt;ref name=c5/&gt; Morrison calls it "among Fauré's most idyllic creations, its principal idea dipping and soaring above a gyrating, moto perpetuo accompaniment".&lt;ref name=m8/&gt; It is marked by a combination of dash and delicacy.&lt;ref name=c5/&gt;

;Impromptu No 4 in D{{music|flat}} major, Op 91 (1906)
Dedicated to "Madame de Marliave" (Marguerite Long),&lt;ref name=p80&gt;Phillips, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; the fourth impromptu was Fauré's return to the genre in his middle period. Unlike much of his music of the period, it avoids a dark mood, but Fauré had by now moved on from the uncomplicated charm of the first three of the set. His mature style is displayed in the central section, a contemplative ''andante'', which is followed by a more agitated section that concludes the work.&lt;ref name=m8/&gt;

;Impromptu No 5 in F{{music|sharp}} minor, Op 102 (1909)
Nectoux describes this impromptu as "a piece of sheer virtuosity celebrating, not without humour, the beauties of the whole-tone scale."&lt;ref name=n382/&gt; Morrison, however, writes that the work "seethes with unrest".&lt;ref name=m8/&gt;

;Impromptu in D{{music|flat}} major, Op 86 ''bis'' (Transcription of the Impromptu for harp, Op 86, 1904)
The last work in the published set was written before numbers four and five. It was originally a harp piece, composed for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire in 1904. Cortot made a transcription for piano, published in 1913 as Fauré's Op 86 ''bis''.&lt;ref name=c5&gt;Cochard, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The outer sections are light and brilliant, with a gentler central section, marked ''[[meno mosso]]''.&lt;ref name=m8&gt;Morrison, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valses-caprices==
The four valses-caprices are not a cycle, but rather two sets of two,  the first  from Fauré's early period and the second from his middle period.&lt;ref name=m3&gt;Morrison, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison calls all four "more 'caprice' than 'waltz{{'"}}, and comments that they combine and develop the scintillating style of Chopin and Saint-Saëns waltzes.&lt;ref name=m10/&gt; They show Fauré at his most playful, presenting variations before the theme is heard and darting in and out of unexpected keys.&lt;ref name=m10/&gt;  Aaron Copland, though generally a keen admirer of Fauré's music,{{#tag:ref|Copland studied in Paris with [[Nadia Boulanger]], a former pupil of Fauré; she was a lifelong devotee of Fauré's music, as was Copland.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, p. 753&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} wrote, "the several ''Valses-Caprices,'' in spite of their admirable qualities, seem to me essentially foreign to Faure's ''esprit''. His is too orderly, too logical a mind to be really capricious."&lt;ref name=copland/&gt; Cortot, by contrast, spoke approvingly of their "sensual grace&amp;nbsp;... perfect distinction&amp;nbsp;... impassioned tenderness."&lt;ref name=k33&gt;Koechlin, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

;Valse-caprice No 1 in A major, Op 30 (1882); and
;Valse-caprice No 2 in D{{music|flat}} major, Op 38 (1884)&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;
Chopin's influence is marked in the first two pieces. Orledge observes that the right-hand figuration at the end of No 1 is remarkably similar to that at the end of Chopin's [[Waltz in E minor (Chopin)|Waltz in E minor]].&lt;ref name=o60&gt;Orledge, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; In No 2 Nectoux detects the additional influence of Liszt (''[[Au bord d'une source]]'') in the opening bars.&lt;ref name="Nectoux_a"&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; In the closing bars of No 2, Orledge finds a resemblance to the end of Chopin's ''[[Grande valse brillante in E flat major (Chopin)|Grande Valse Brillante]]'', Op, 18.&lt;ref name=o60/&gt;

;Valse-caprice No 3 in G{{music|flat}} major, Op 59 (1887–93); and
;Valse-caprice No 4 in A{{music|flat}} major, Op 62 (1893–94)&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;
Orledge writes that the second two valses-caprices are subtler and better integrated than the first two; they contain "more moments of quiet contemplation and more thematic development than before." There still remain touches of virtuosity and traces of Liszt, and these two valses-caprices are, in Orledge's words, the only solo pieces in the middle period to end in a loud and spectacular manner.&lt;ref name=o92&gt;Orledge, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
No 3 is dedicated to Mme. Philippe Dieterlen, No 4 to Mme. Max Lyon.&lt;ref name=p129&gt;Phillips, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other solo piano works==

===Romances sans paroles, Op 17===
[[File:Gabriel Fauré en uniforme de l'Ecole Niedermeyer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=young man in scholastic uniform of the 19th century|Fauré as a student in 1864]]
Fauré wrote these three "songs without words" while still a student at the École Niedermeyer, in about 1863. They were not published until 1880, but they then became some of his most popular works. Copland considered them immature pieces, which "should be relegated to the indiscretions every young composer commits."&lt;ref name=copland/&gt; Later critics have taken a less severe view; Morrison describes the Romances as "an affectionate and very Gallic tribute to Mendelssohn's urbanity, agitation and ease."&lt;ref name="m10" /&gt; The commentator Keith Anderson writes that although they were a popular French counterpart to Mendelssohn's ''[[Songs without Words]]'', Fauré's own voice is already recognisable. Instead of placing the slowest piece in the middle of the set and ending with the lively A minor piece, Fauré, already with musical views of his own, switches the expected order, and the set ends ''pianissimo'', fading to nothing.&lt;ref name=a4&gt;Anderson (1993), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

;Andante quasi allegretto
The first romance, in A{{music|flat}} major, has as an opening theme an uncomplicated melody with Mendelssohnian syncopations. The theme is presented first in the higher and then in the middle register, before flowing evenly to its conclusion.&lt;ref name=a4/&gt;

;Allegro molto
The second romance, in A minor, an exuberant piece, has a strong semiquaver figure supporting the theme, and running high into the treble and low into the bass. This was later to become one of Fauré's most recognisable characteristics. After a lively display, the piece ends quietly.&lt;ref name=a4/&gt;

;Andante moderato
The final piece of the set, in A{{music|flat}} major, is a serene ''andante'', with a flowing tune in the Mendelssohnian style. After gentle variation, it equally gently fades to silence at the end.&lt;ref name=a4/&gt;

===Ballade in F{{music|sharp}} major, Op 19===
The Ballade, dedicated to [[Camille Saint-Saëns]], dates from 1877. It is one of Fauré's most substantial works for solo piano, but is better known in a version for piano and orchestra that he made in 1881 at Liszt's suggestion.&lt;ref name="Nectoux" /&gt; Playing for a little over 14 minutes, it is second in length only to the ''Thème et variations.''&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, pp. 3–5&lt;/ref&gt;  Fauré first conceived the music as a set of individual pieces, but then decided to make them into a single work by carrying the main theme of each section over into the following section as a secondary theme.&lt;ref name=h7&gt;Howat (''Piano Works by Gabriel Fauré'') p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The work opens with the F{{music|sharp}} major theme, an ''andante cantabile'', which is followed by a slower section, marked ''lento'', in E{{music|flat}} minor. The third section is an andante introducing a third theme. In the last section, an allegro, a return of the second theme brings the work to a conclusion in which Nectoux comments, the treble sings with particular delicacy.&lt;ref name="Nectoux_a" /&gt;

[[Marcel Proust]] knew Fauré, and the Ballade is thought to have been the inspiration for the sonata by Proust's character Vinteuil that haunts Swann in ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''.&lt;ref name=h7/&gt;  [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], reviewing an early performance of the Ballade, compared the music with the attractive soloist, straightening her shoulder-straps during the performance: "I don't know why, but I somehow associated the charm of these gestures with the music of Fauré himself. The play of fleeting curves that is its essence can be compared to the movements of a beautiful woman without either suffering from the comparison."&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, Robin. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1004069 "Master of Hearts",] ''The Musical Times'', Vol. 136, No. 1830 (August 1995), pp. 394–396 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison describes the Ballade as "a reminder of halcyon, half-remembered summer days and bird-haunted forests".&lt;ref name=m11/&gt;

===Mazurka in B{{music|flat}} major, Op 32===
The [[Mazurka]] was composed in the mid-1870s but not published until 1883.&lt;ref name="Nectoux_b" /&gt; It is a tribute to Chopin, and contains echoes of the earlier composer's music.&lt;ref name=m14/&gt; Chopin, however, composed more than 60 mazurkas, and Fauré wrote only this one. Morrison regards it as an experiment on Fauré's part.&lt;ref name=m14/&gt; The piece owes little to Polish folk-dance rhythms, and may have had a Russian influence through Fauré's friendship with [[Sergei Taneyev]] at around the time of its composition.&lt;ref&gt;Howat (Antokoletz and Wheeldon), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Pavane'', Op 50===
{{main|Pavane (Fauré)}}
The ''Pavane'' (1887) was conceived and originally written as an orchestral piece.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux (1984), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Fauré published the version for piano in 1889.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref name=h155&gt;Howat (2009), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; In the form of an ancient dance, the piece was written to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its familiar orchestral guise. The conductor [[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]] heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than [[beats per minute|crochet=100]].&lt;ref name=h272&gt;Howat (2009), p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the ''Pavane'' was not a piece of German romanticism.&lt;ref name=h272/&gt;

===Thème et variations in C{{music|sharp}} minor, Op 73===
Written in 1895, when he was 50, this is among Fauré's most extended compositions for piano,&lt;ref name=d117&gt;Duchen (2000), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; with a performance time of about 15 minutes.&lt;ref name=m3/&gt; Although it has many passages that reflect the influence of Schumann's ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', in Jessica Duchen's words "its harmonies and pianistic idioms" are unmistakably those of Fauré.&lt;ref name=d117/&gt; As in the earlier ''Romances sans paroles'', Op 17, Fauré does not follow the conventional course of ending with the loudest and most extrovert variation; the variation nearest to that description is placed next to last, and is followed by a gentle conclusion, "a typically Faurean understated finish."&lt;ref name=d117/&gt; Copland wrote of the work:
{{quote|Certainly it is one of Faure's most approachable works. Even at first hearing it leaves an indelible impression. The "Theme" itself has the same fateful, march-like tread, the same atmosphere of tragedy and heroism, that we find in the introduction of Brahms's [[Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)|First Symphony]]. And the variety and spontaneity of the eleven variations which follow bring to mind nothing less than the ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Etudes]].'' How many pianists, I wonder, have not regretted that the composer disdained the easy triumph of closing on the brilliant, dashing tenth variation. No, poor souls, they must turn the page and play that last, enigmatic (and most beautiful) one, which seems to leave the audience with so little desire to applaud.&lt;ref name=copland/&gt;|}}

===Prelude to ''Pénélope''===
Fauré's opera based on the legend of Ulysses and Penelope was first performed in 1913, after which the composer published a version of the prelude transcribed for piano. The piece, in G minor, contrasts a gravely noble ''andante moderato'' theme representing Penelope with a forthright theme for Ulysses. The polyphonic writing transfers effectively from the orchestral original to the piano.&lt;ref name=c5/&gt;

===''8 Pièces brèves'', Op 84===
[[File:Gabriel Fauré dans le jardin du Conservatoire.jpg|thumb|right|alt=elderly man, bowler-hatted and luxuriantly moustached in a city garden|Fauré in the gardens of the Conservatoire, 1918]]
Fauré did not intend these pieces to be published as a set; they were composed as individual works between 1869 and 1902.&lt;ref name=m4/&gt; When [[Julien Hamelle|Hamelle]], his publishers, insisted on issuing them together as "Eight Short Pieces" in 1902, the composer successfully demanded that none of the eight must be allocated its own title. When he moved on to another publisher, Hamelle ignored his earlier instructions and issued subsequent editions with titles for each piece.{{#tag:ref|Hamelle retained the publishing rights to Fauré's earlier music after he moved to the publisher Heugel. When asked if he regretted Fauré's departure, "Père" Hamelle, head of the firm, tapped his pocket and replied, "No skin off my nose. I've got what sells."&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux (1991), pp. 275 (Hamelle quote) and 299 (retitling)&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Nectoux comments that the labelling of the eighth piece as "Nocturne No 8" is particularly questionable (see ''Nocturne [No 8]'', below).&lt;ref name=n299&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; In the first decade of the 21st century the publisher Peters issued a new critical edition of the Eight Pieces with the spurious titles removed.&lt;ref name=h6&gt;Howat (''Piano Works by Gabriel Fauré''), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The eight pieces take less than three minutes each in performance.&lt;ref name=m4&gt;Morrison, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Capriccio in E{{music|flat}} major:''' Dedicated to Madame Jean Leonard Koechlin.&lt;ref name=p133&gt;Phillips, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison calls it "capricious indeed", and notes a harmonic twist at the end "as nonchalant as it is acrobatic".&lt;ref name=m13/&gt; It was originally written as a sight-reading test for students at the [[Paris Conservatoire]], of which Fauré was the professor of composition from 1896 and director from 1905 to 1920.&lt;ref name=h6/&gt;

'''Fantaisie in A{{music|flat}} major:''' Koechlin calls this piece a pleasant ''[[Album leaf (music)|feuillet d'album]]''.&lt;ref name=k35&gt;Koechlin, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fugue in A minor:''' This, like the other fugue in the set, is a revised version of a fugue Fauré composed at the start of his career, when he was a church organist in [[Rennes]]. They are both, in Koechlin's view "in a pleasant and correct style, obviously less rich than those in the Well-Tempered Clavier, and more careful, but whose reserve conceals an incontestable mastery".&lt;ref name=k35/&gt;

'''Adagietto in E minor:''' An ''andante moderato'', "serious, grave, at once firm and pliant, attaining real beauty" (Koechlin).&lt;ref name=k35/&gt;

'''Improvisation in C{{music|sharp}} minor:''' Orledge calls this piece a middle period "song without words".&lt;ref&gt;Orledge, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; It was composed as a sight-reading test for the Conservatoire.&lt;ref name=k35/&gt;

'''Fugue in E minor:''' See Fugue in A minor, above.

'''Allégresse in C major:''' "A bubbling perpetuum mobile whose surging romantic feelings are only just kept under restraint" (Orledge).&lt;ref&gt;Orledge, pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; "A song, pure and gay, uplifted to a sunlit sky, a youthful outpouring, full of happiness." (Koechlin).&lt;ref name=k35/&gt;

'''Nocturne [No 8] in D{{music|flat}} major:''' As noted above, this piece stands apart from the larger-scale works to which Fauré gave the title "nocturne".  It  would not be listed among them were it not for the publisher's unauthorised use of the title in this case.{{#tag:ref|In at least three recorded sets of the collected piano music (Jean Philippe Collard, 1974, Paul Crossley, 1984, and Kathryn Stott, 1994) the piece is played twice – first as the last of the "Eight Short Pieces", and again as part of the set of 13 nocturnes.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} It is the longest of the eight pieces of Op 84, but is much shorter and simpler than the other 12 nocturnes, consisting of a song-like main theme with a delicate semiquaver accompaniment in the left hand.&lt;ref name=a1/&gt;

===9 Préludes, Op 103===
[[File:Gabriel Fauré, devant son piano, dans son appartement boulevard Malesherbes.jpg|alt=elderly man leaning against grand piano| thumb|right|300px|Fauré, next to the piano in his flat in the boulevard Malesherbes, Paris, 1905]]
The nine préludes are among the least known of Fauré's major piano compositions.&lt;ref name=oliver/&gt; They were written while the composer was struggling to come to terms with the onset of deafness in his mid-sixties.&lt;ref name=cochard3&gt;Cochard, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; By Fauré's standards this was a time of unusually prolific output.  The préludes were composed in 1909 and 1910, in the middle of the period in which he wrote the opera ''[[Pénélope]]'', barcarolles Nos. 8–11 and nocturnes Nos. 9–11.&lt;ref name=cochard3/&gt;

In Koechlin's view, "Apart from the ''Préludes'' of Chopin, it is hard to think of a collection of similar pieces that are so important".&lt;ref name=k36/&gt; The critic Michael Oliver wrote, "Fauré's Préludes are among the subtlest and most elusive piano pieces in existence; they express deep but mingled emotions, sometimes with intense directness&amp;nbsp;... more often with the utmost economy and restraint and with mysteriously complex simplicity."&lt;ref name=oliver&gt;Oliver, Michael. [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/January%201988/48/756706/ "Fauré – Nine Préludes",] ''Gramophone'', January 1988, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Jessica Duchen calls them "unusual slivers of magical inventiveness."&lt;ref&gt;Duchen (2000), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; The complete set takes between 20 and 25 minutes to play. The shortest of the set, No 8, lasts barely more than a minute; the longest, No 3, takes between four and five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

;Prélude No 1 in D{{music|flat}} major
''Andante molto moderato''. The first prélude is in the manner of a nocturne.&lt;ref name=cochard3/&gt; Morrison refers to the cool serenity with which it opens, contrasted with the "slow and painful climbing" of the middle section.&lt;ref name=m13&gt;Morrison, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

;Prélude No 2 in C{{music|sharp}} minor
''Allegro.'' The ''moto perpetuo'' of the second prélude is technically difficult for the pianist; even the most celebrated Fauré interpreter can be stretched by it.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Harriet. [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/May%202007/101/738201/ "Fauré Franck",] ''Gramophone'', May 2007, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;  Koechlin calls it "a feverish whirling of dervishes, concluding in a sort of ecstasy, with the evocation of some fairy palace."&lt;ref name=k35/&gt;

;Prélude No 3 in G minor
''Andante.'' Copland considered this prélude the most immediately accessible of the set. "At first, what will most attract you, will be the third in G-minor, a strange mixture of the romantic and classic."&lt;ref name=copland/&gt; The musicologist [[Vladimir Jankélévitch]] wrote, "it might be a barcarolle strangely interrupting a theme of very modern stylistic contour".&lt;ref name=jank&gt;''Quoted'' in Cochard, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

;Prélude No 4 in F major
''Allegretto moderato.'' The fourth prélude is among the gentlest of the set. The critic Alain Cochard writes that it "casts a spell on the ear through the subtlety of a harmony tinged with the modal and its melodic freshness."&lt;ref name=cochard4&gt;Cochard, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Koechlin calls it "a guileless pastorale, flexible, with succinct and refined modulations".&lt;ref name=k35/&gt;

;Prélude No 5  in D minor
''Allegro.'' Cochard quotes the earlier writer [[Louis Aguettant]]'s description of this prélude as "This fine outburst of anger (''Ce bel accès de colère'')". The mood is turbulent and anxious;&lt;ref name=cochard4/&gt;  the piece ends in quiet resignation reminiscent of the "Libera me" of the ''[[Requiem (Fauré)|Requiem]]''.&lt;ref name=k35/&gt;

;Prélude No 6 in E{{music|flat}} minor
''Andante.'' Fauré is at his most classical in this prélude, which is in the form of a [[canon (music)|canon]]. Copland wrote that it "can be placed side by side with the most wonderful of the Preludes of the ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier|Well-Tempered Clavichord]]''."&lt;ref name=copland/&gt;

;Prélude No 7 in A major
''Andante moderato.'' Morrison writes that this prélude, with its "stammering and halting progress" conveys an inconsolable grief.&lt;ref name=m13/&gt; After the opening andante moderato, it becomes gradually more assertive, and subsides to conclude in the subdued mood of the opening.&lt;ref name=m13/&gt; The rhythm of one of Fauré's best-known songs, "N'est-ce-pas?" from ''[[La bonne chanson]]'', runs through the piece.&lt;ref name=k36&gt;Koechlin, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

;Prélude No 8 in C minor
''Allegro.'' In Copland's view this is, with the third, the most approachable of the Préludes, "with its dry, acrid brilliance (so rarely found in Faure)."&lt;ref name=copland/&gt; Morrison describes it as "a repeated-note scherzo" going "from nowhere to nowhere."&lt;ref name=m13/&gt;

;Prélude No 9  in E minor
''Adagio.'' Copland described this prélude as "so simple – so absolutely simple that we can never hope to understand how it can contain such great emotional power."&lt;ref name=copland/&gt; The prélude is withdrawn in mood; Jankélévitch wrote that it "belongs from beginning to end to another world."&lt;ref name=jank/&gt; Koechlin notes echoes of the "Offertoire" of the ''Requiem'' throughout the piece.&lt;ref name=k36/&gt;

==For two pianists==
[[File:Messager-by-fauré.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=pencil drawing of a balding, moustached man in left profile|Caricature by Fauré of his friend and co-composer of ''Souvenirs de Bayreuth'', [[André Messager]]]]
;Souvenirs de Bayreuth
Subtitled ''Fantasie en forme de quadrille sur les thèmes favoris de l'Anneau de Nibelung'' ("Fantasy in the form of a quadrille on favourite themes from ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]''"). Fauré admired the music of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and was familiar with the smallest details of his scores,&lt;ref name=nectoux39&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; but he was one of the few composers of his generation not to come under Wagner's musical influence.&lt;ref name=nectoux39/&gt;
From 1878, Fauré and his friend and ex-pupil [[André Messager]] made trips abroad to see Wagner operas. They saw ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' and ''[[Die Walküre]]'' at [[Cologne Opera]]; the complete ''Ring'' cycle in Munich and London; and ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg|Die Meistersinger]]'' in Munich and at [[Bayreuth Festival|Bayreuth]], where they also saw ''[[Parsifal]]''.&lt;ref name="Jones 51"/&gt; They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent ''Souvenirs de Bayreuth'', written in about 1888. This short, skittish piano work for four hands sends up themes from ''The Ring''. It consists of five short sections in which Wagner's themes are transformed into dance rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, John and [[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Andrew Lamb]]. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/18492 "Messager, André"]. ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 14 August 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript (in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]], Paris) is in Messager's hand.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

;Suite d'orchestre, Op 20
Between 1867 and 1873, Fauré wrote a symphonic work for full orchestra. The piece was first heard in 1873 when Fauré and Saint-Saëns performed it in a two-piano version, but that transcription has not survived.&lt;ref name=a3&gt;Anderson (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Léon Boëllmann]] made a new transcription of the first movement in 1893.&lt;ref name=a3/&gt;

;Dolly Suite, Op 56
{{Main|Dolly (Fauré)}}
[[File:Gabriel Fauré jouant à quatre mains avec Melle Lombard.jpg|thumb|left|alt=a young girl and an elderly man duetting at a grand piano|Fauré playing ''[[wiktionary:secondo|secondo]]'' with Mlle Lombard, a family friend]]
The ''Dolly Suite'' is a six-section work for [[piano four-hands|piano duet]]. It was inspired by Hélène, nicknamed "Dolly", daughter of the singer [[Emma Bardac]] with whom Fauré was intimately associated in the 1890s. The opening piece was a present for Dolly's first birthday, and Fauré added the other five pieces to mark her subsequent birthdays and other family occasions. Unusually for Fauré, who generally favoured strictly functional titles, the movements of the suite have whimsical titles associated with Dolly and her family.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Its six movements take about fifteen minutes to perform.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, pp. 8 and 13&lt;/ref&gt; The first is a Berceuse, or cradle-song. "Mi-a-ou", despite a title suggesting a cat, in fact represents the infant Dolly's attempts to pronounce the name of her brother Raoul; after "Le jardin de Dolly", the "Kitty Valse", again confounds its feline title, being a sketch of the family's pet dog. After the gentle "Tendresse", the suite ends with a lively evocation of Spain, which, Orledge notes, is one of Fauré's few purely extrovert pieces.&lt;ref  name=o95&gt;Orledge, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

;Masques et bergamasques, Op 112
From the orchestral suite drawn from his music for the stage presentation ''[[Masques et bergamasques (Fauré)|Masques et bergamasques]]'', Fauré made a transcription for piano duet, which was published in 1919. Like the orchestral suite, it consists of four movements, titled "Ouverture", "Menuet", "Gavotte" and "Pastorale".&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
{{Listen|filename=Berceuse by Gabriel Fauré op56 no1.ogg|title=Berceuse from Dolly|description=The [[Berceuse]] from [[Dolly (Fauré)|Dolly]] by [[Gabriel Fauré]].|pos=right}}
Fauré made [[piano roll]]s of his music for several companies between 1905 and 1913. The rolls that survive are of the "Romance sans paroles" No 3, Barcarolle No 1, Prelude No 3, Nocturne No 3, ''Thème et variations'', ''Valses-caprices'' Nos 1, 3 and 4, and piano versions of the ''Pavane'', and the "Sicilienne" from Fauré's music for ''Pelléas and Mélisande''. Several of these rolls have been transferred to CD.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux (1991), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Recordings on disc were few until the 1940s. A survey by [[John Culshaw]] in December 1945 singled out recordings of piano works played by [[Kathleen Long]], including the Nocturne No 6, Barcarolle No 2, the Thème et Variations, Op 73, and the Ballade Op 19 in its orchestral version.&lt;ref&gt;Culshaw, John. [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/December%201945/15/792329/ "The Return of Fauré"] ''The Gramophone'', December 1945, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Fauré's music began to appear more frequently in the record companies' releases in the 1950s.

In the LP and particularly the CD era, the record companies built up a substantial catalogue of Fauré's piano music, performed by French and non-French musicians. The piano works were first recorded largely complete in the mid-1950s by [[Germaine Thyssens-Valentin]],&lt;ref&gt;Testament Records, SBT1400, SBT1215, SBT1262, and SBT1263&lt;/ref&gt; with later sets being made by [[Grant Johannesen]] (1961),&lt;ref&gt;Initially Golden Crest LPs, reissued on VAI CDs ASIN: B00000G50B&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Doyen]] (1966–1969),&lt;ref&gt;Erato, ASIN: B000001Z3C&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Philippe Collard]] (1974),&lt;ref&gt;EMI Records, catalogue number 5 85261-2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Crossley (musician)|Paul Crossley]] (1984–85),&lt;ref&gt;CRD Records, catalogue number 5006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Hubeau]] (1988–89),&lt;ref&gt;Erato Records, catalogue number 2564 69923-6&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Kathryn Stott]] (1995).&lt;ref name=m3/&gt;  Recital selections of major piano works have been recorded by many pianists including [[Vlado Perlemuter]] (1989), &lt;ref&gt;Nimbus Records, catalogue number 5165&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pascal Rogé]] (1990),&lt;ref&gt;Decca Records, catalogue number 425 606–40&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kun-Woo Paik]] (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Decca Records, catalogue number 470 246–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Scînteia 21 decembrie 1989.jpg|thumb|300px|The penultimate issue of ''Scînteia'', 21 December 1989. The headline reads: "''Comrade [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s speech for radio and television stations''" (official answer to the outbreak of the [[Romanian Revolution]])]]
{{Communist Romania}}
'''''Scînteia''''' ("The Spark"; the [[Romanian alphabet|initial spelling]] of the name in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] was ''Scânteia'' until the change of the orthography in 1953, as it would have been again, the orthography having officially reverted in 1993) was the name of two [[newspaper]]s edited by [[Communist]] groups at different intervals in [[Romania]]n history. The title was a borrowing from the [[Russian language|Russian]] ''[[Iskra]]''.

==History==
[[File:Miner reading Scanteia 1944.jpg|thumb|right|Miner reading ''Scânteia'']]
The first paper of that name was edited by Romanian revolutionaries in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]], appearing throughout 1919 in the city of [[Odessa]].

''Scînteia'' reemerged as the official voice of the [[Communist Party of Romania]] on August 15, 1931, being published clandestinely in [[Bucharest]] until 1940 (when the hostility between Romania and the [[Soviet Union]] grew to a level where a crackdown on [[communist propaganda]] became imminent).

With Romania [[King Michael's Coup|withdrawing]] from the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] and joining the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in August 1944, ''Scînteia'' was yet again being published, to remain the approved, sanctioning, body of communist politics. During [[Communist Romania]] (since early 1948), it was the barometer of policy changes, and the main medium through which the regime indicated its aims (for example, ''Scînteia'' served as the tribune for [[slander]] campaigns against intellectuals such as [[Tudor Arghezi]]). Moreover, (indicative of the relations between the official voice and other media), in 1961, August 15 was declared the ''Romanian Press Day''.

The headquarters of the paper were the main feature of the [[Socialist Realism|Socialist Realist]] ''Combinatul Poligrafic Casa Scînteii "I.V.Stalin"'', a name later reduced to ''Casa Scînteii'', after it dropped the reference to [[Joseph Stalin]] during [[De-Stalinization in Romania|De-Stalinization]]. Today, the building goes by the name ''[[Casa Presei Libere]]'' ("The House of the Free Press").

''Scînteia'' was accompanied by a youth version, one edited by the [[Union of Communist Youth]] (a branch of the Party that resembled the Soviet [[Komsomol]] up to a point). '''''Scînteia Tineretului''''' (or ''Scânteia tineretului''; approximately "Youth's Spark") began its edition in November 1944. It was also published under the names of ''Tinerețea'' ("The Youth") and ''Tînărul Muncitor'' (or ''Tânărul Muncitor''; "The Young Worker").

With the [[Romanian Revolution]] came the outlawing of all Communist Party institutions, including all its newspapers. ''Scînteia'''s assets were mostly taken over by the post-communist ''[[Adevărul]]''.

The '''Shubhodaya Controversy''' is related to the heated debates in India about a court case that happened in 1919 around a newspaper article in the [[Kannada language]] daily ''[[Shubhodaya]]''. Under the title "Allama, Basava Vrittantavenu? (What is the Description of Allama and Basava, dated 18 April 1919), R. Shrinivasacharya wrote certain historical details which allegedly tarnished the image of [[Basavanna]] and [[Allama Prabhu|Allama]].&lt;ref name=Boratti&gt;{{cite book|last=Boratti|first=Vijayakumar|title=Hiriyara Hiritana Hindenaayitu|year=2011|publisher=Kannada University|location=Karnataka|pages=63–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This article triggered the wrath of the [[Lingayatism|Lingayata]]s and resulted in Siddaramappa Pawate, a well known legal practitioner and a Lingayata scholar, suing{{why|date=December 2013}} Shrinivasacharya in the first grade Magistrate court of [[Dharwad]]. 

The court case led to series of debates about the history of 12th century [[Shiva Sharanas]] and their contribution to Lingayata religion. The controversy was an important historical event for the Lingayatas who were provoked to rethink their image in the public sphere. The controversy threw open several questions related to [[History of Lingayatism|Lingayata history]], literature and philosophy. The Lingayatas had to assert their identity as a community and they accomplished it by actively participating in the debates and discussions. The controversy proved to be a guiding force for scholars like [[Phakirappa Gurubasappa Halakatti|P. G. Halakatti]] to refashion Lingayata literature and history. This controversy was one of the turning points for re-imagining the Lingayata history and community in colonial [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref name=Boratti /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kannada&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lego Movie: 4D - A New Adventure''''' is a [[4-D film]] attraction based on ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' that premiered at [[Legoland Florida]] on January 29, 2016.

==Plot==
Following the events of ''[[The Lego Movie]]'', Emmet, Wyldstyle, Unikitty, Benny and MetalBeard reunite to go to [[Legoland]]. However, they instead receive an invitation to go to a [[knock-off]] called Brick World. They then meet Risky Business, Lord Business' older brother, who tries to [[hypnotise]] them to perform in a ''Lego Movie'' live show. MetalBeard, Unikitty and Benny quickly go to their attractions, while Emmet goes with Wyldstyle to his. Emmet is unhappy, so Wyldstyle takes him to her attraction to cheer him up. 

Because of the extent, the group end up enjoying Brick World; Business takes advantage and sends his robots to hypnotise them with [[VIP]] [[wristbands]]. Emmet and Wyldstyle evade being hypnotised and discover Business' evil plans, as well as the audience. With the help of the audience, Emmet and Wyldstyle build a lemonade stand mech and save their friends. Business tries to escape, but a policeman stopped Risky from this, arresting him for making Brick World without permission. Emmet and Wyldstyle thank the audience before finally heading to Legoland with their friends.

'''''The Runaway Bunny''''' is a [[concerto]] for violin, reader and orchestra by the contemporary American composer [[Glen Roven]], with text from the classic children's bedtime story ''[[The Runaway Bunny]]'' by [[Margaret Wise Brown]]. The concerto premiered at [[Carnegie Hall]] on April 29, 2008 with Roven conducting the [[American Symphony Orchestra]] with [[Glenn Close]] narrating.&lt;ref name="Theater Mania"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipton|first=Brian Scott|title=Glenn Close to Narrate Glen Roven's Runaway Bunny at Carnegie Hall|url=http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/news/04-2008/glenn-close-to-narrate-glen-rovens-runaway-bunny-a_13407.html|work=Theater Mania|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition history ==

Composer Glen Roven first conceived of writing a piece based on ''The Runaway Bunny'' after having seen the 2001 film ''[[Wit (film)|Wit]]'' based on the play of the same name by [[Margaret Edson]].&lt;ref name="Roven's BLog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roven|first=Glen|title=The Bunny, The Moon and Me|url=http://glenroven.blogspot.com/2010/04/bunny-moon-and-me.html|work=Glen Roven's Blog|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, ''The Runaway Bunny'' is read to [[Emma Thompson]] by [[Eileen Atkins]]. 
Roven's first sketches were for a concerto for violin, singer and orchestra, however upon advice of the Israeli violinist Ittai Shapira, (for whom the solo violin part was originally written), it was decided to replace the singer with narration integrated into the overall musical structure. The work is in a single movement, with numerous tempo changes depicting the bunny's adventures.

According to the composer, ''The Runaway Bunny'' is similar to other classical concert works based on children's stories such as Prokofiev's ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', Kleinsinger's "[[Tubby the Tuba (song)|Tubby the Tuba]]", Chappell's "Paddington Bear's First Concert" or Poulenc's "L'histoire de Babar."&lt;ref name="Classical BWW"&gt;{{cite web|last=Classical Music News Desk|title=Photo Flash: The Runaway Bunny|url=http://classical.broadwayworld.com/article/Photo-Flash-The-Runaway-Bunny-20080501|work=Classical Broadway World|publisher=Wisdom Digital Media|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The composer has subsequently arranged the orchestral score for [[piano trio]] and piano solo. All editions are published by Bill Holab Music.

This is the first concert piece to be based upon one of Margaret Wise Brown's popular children's tales.

=== The text ===

The text for Glen Roven's composition is drawn from ''The Runaway Bunny'', a 1942 picture book written by Margaret Wise Brown and illustrated by [[Clement Hurd]]. The plot deals with a little bunny who wants to run away, becoming variously a fish, a rock on the mountain, a crocus in a hidden garden, a bird, a sailboat, a circus acrobat, a finally a little boy until he resigns himself to just stay where he is and remain his mother's little bunny. Brown claimed that her inspiration for ''The Runaway Bunny'' came from "Chanson de Magali", a love song based on French Provençal folklore.&lt;ref name=clack&gt;{{cite web|last=Clack|first=George|title=The Strange, Wonderful Life of Margaret Wise Brown|url=http://www.317am.net/2011/12/the-strange-wonderful-life-of-margaret-wise-brown.html|work=3:17am|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[call-and-response (music)]] structure of Brown's text provides an emotionally compelling depiction of a small child's first burst of independence and a mother's affirmation of unconditional love.&lt;ref name=Read&gt;{{cite web|last=Cesaretti|first=Ms.|title=Module 1: The Runaway Bunny|url=http://readbeneaththecovers.blogspot.com/2012/12/module-1-runaway-bunny.html|work=Read Beneath the Covers|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is a collection of essays and also features two one act plays, ''[[Death (play)|Death]]'' and ''[[God (play)|God]]''.

==Title meaning==
The title ''Without Feathers'' is a reference to [[Emily Dickinson]]'s poem "'Hope' Is the Thing with Feathers", reflecting Woody Allen's neurotic sense of hopelessness.

{{nihongo||龍が如く 見参！|'''Ryū ga Gotoku Kenzan!'''|"Like a Dragon Arrives!"|lead=yes}},&lt;ref name="macbeth" /&gt; unofficially known as '''''Yakuza Kenzan''''', is a ''[[jidaigeki]]''-themed spin-off game in the [[Yakuza (series)|''Yakuza'' series]]. The game was developed and published by [[Sega]] for [[PlayStation 3]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ps3.ign.com/articles/819/819597p1.html Yakuza 3 is a PS3 exclusive]&lt;/ref&gt; It was unveiled at the [[Tokyo Game Show]] 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jp.playstation.com/tgs2007/ps3/titles/sega_ryu.html PlayStation.com(Japan) TGS 2007 upcoming titles]&lt;/ref&gt; and released in 2008.

A second ''Yakuza'' series spin-off set in samurai era, ''[[Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin!]]'', was released in 2014 on both the PlayStation 3 and the [[PlayStation 4]] systems. ''Ishin!'' is set two centuries later than ''Kenzan!'', hence the plots are not related to each other since both games focus on different characters, the historical figures of [[Sakamoto Ryōma]] (1836-1867) and [[Miyamoto Musashi]] (1584-1645) respectively.

==Gameplay==

===Adventure===
The gameplay shows minimal evolution from the first two episodes except for the new item storage system which allows to access an unlimited amount of items from savepoints.&lt;ref name="Famitsu Article"&gt;[http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=189397 Famitsu Article]&lt;/ref&gt; However the graphical engine's improvement is obvious during the numerous real-time 3D cutscenes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8a8u8_yakuza-kenzan-cutscene-dintroductio_videogames Yakuza Kenzan! (opening cutscene)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle===
There are four fighting styles in the game; fists, one blade, two blades and [[two-handed sword|two-handed blades]]. There are also [[QTE]]-based special moves that the player can execute, known as 'heat action'.&lt;ref name="Famitsu Article"/&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Kyoto gion02.jpg|thumb|The action moves from [[Kamurocho]] to [[Kyoto]]'s [[Gion]] district]]
[[File:Kyoto3b.JPG|left|thumb|Landmarks such as the [[Kiyomizu Temple]] and [[Nijō Castle]] are modeled in the game]]

===Setting===
This spin-off is set in Kyoto during the [[Edo period]], in 1605. It is an account of the life of [[Miyamoto Musashi]]. The main adventure is completed with sidestories including minigames and a hundred "sub-stories".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jp.playstation.com/software/title/bljm60064.html PlayStation.com(Japan) Software Catalog - Ryu ga Gotoku Kenzan!]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Story===

After being defeated by the [[Tokugawa clan]] at the historical [[Battle of Sekigahara]] which took place on October 20, 1600, Miyamoto Musashi retired from his great swordsman life to become a modest ''[[Bodyguard|yojimbo]]'' (bodyguard) in [[Gion]] (祇園), [[Kyoto]]. Five years after the battle, a little girl named Haruka comes to Gion seeking a local hitman known as [[Kazuma Kiryu|Kazumanosuke Kiryu]] which is actually Miyamoto's new identity. After eventually finding Kiryū, Haruka asks for him to assassinate an impostor pretending to be Miyamoto Musashi. At first, Kiryu refuses, then when the girl goes as far as becoming an indentured servant in an opulent ''[[oiran]]'' [[brothel]] in order to pay the assassination mission he accepts the one-[[ryō]] request.

[[File:Ryu ga gotoku kenzan event mode character.jpg|thumb|[[Cyberware Inc.]]'s facial scan technology was used with main characters and fully exploited on the Event Mode's high polygon models. Here character [[Gion Toji]] borrows actor [[Takashi Tsukamoto]]'s physical appearance]]

==Releases==

Two playable demos were released on January 7, 2008 via the Japanese [[PlayStation Store]].

As part of the pre-ordering campaign, the Japanese first print was bundled with a limited item, a [[monography]] called ''Kamutai Magazine'' (March 2008 issue). Sony celebrated the Japanese release of the game with a 10,000 pieces limited edition Satin Silver 40GB model "PlayStation 3 Like a Dragon Kenzan! Pack" (龍が如く 見参！パック, ''ryu ga gotoku kenzan! pakku'') [[Stock-keeping unit|SKU]] including a "Rising Dragon" (昇竜, ''noburyu'') stickers set to customize the console case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=『龍が如く 見参！』と新色サテン・シルバーのプレイステーション3本体を同梱した特別パックが発売|publisher=Famitsu website|url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1213425_1124.html|date=2008-02-05|accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late December 2009, commenting the opportunity of a western release, Sega Australia managing director Darren Macbeth said "there is nothing in the plan at this stage for Yakuza Kenzan. Right now we are focusing on the release of Yakuza 3. The feedback we get from this release will help us in making future decisions".&lt;ref name="macbeth"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nagoshi talks Yakuza 3|author= Laura Parker|publisher=GameSpot AU|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pages/gamespace/updates.php?pid=950186&amp;sid=6243556&amp;skipmc=1&amp;mode=previews|date=2009-12-28|accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, ''Yakuza 3'' had a western release as did in 2011 ''[[Yakuza 4]]''. Then again, in 2012, a second spinoff was also released abroad and localized as ''[[Yakuza: Dead Souls]]''.

'''Émilienne d'Alençon''' (1869–1946) was a French dancer, actress and [[courtesan]].

==Biography==

Born in Paris, d'Alençon made her début at the [[Cirque d'été]] in 1889 before appearing at the [[Casino de Paris]], [[Théâtre Antoine-Simone Berriau|Menus-Plaisirs]], [[Folies Bergère]], Paris Scala and the [[Théâtre des Variétés]]. Among her earlier shows were ''Paris Boulevards'', ''Vénus d'Arles'' and ''Que d'eau Que d'eau''. She appeared in ''La Belle et la Bête'' at the Folies Bergères and she danced in the ballet ''The Red Slippers'' in London. She also performed as a dancer at the Paris Olympia in ''Faust'' and ''Grand Ballet Féerie''. In 1892, she came on stage as a snake dancer.&lt;ref name=rosa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lebenundstil.blogspot.com/2012/11/die-rosa-kaninchen-der-emilienne.html|title=Die rosa Kaninchen der Émilienne d'Alençon|publisher=Leben &amp; Stil |accessdate=1 March 2014 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renowned as a courtesan, she was involved in a number of affairs including one with the industrialist [[Étienne Balsan]]. In 1895, she married the jockey Percy Woodland. 
Émilienne d'Alençon left the stage in 1906 and invested in [[horse racing]]. After losing her fortune on drugs and gambling in 1931, she was forced to sell her property and lavish furniture. She died in [[Nice]] in 1946.&lt;ref name=rosa/&gt;
