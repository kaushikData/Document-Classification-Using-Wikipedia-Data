'''''Abatement ab initio''''' is a [[common law]] [[legal doctrine]] that states that the death of a defendant who is appealing a criminal [[conviction]] [[Vacated judgment|vacates]] the conviction.  Abatement ab initio was the subject of two [[United States Supreme Court]] decisions, [[Durham v. United States (1971)|Durham v. United States]] (1971) and [[Dove v. United States]] (1976). The former extended the doctrine to cases where [[certiorari]] was pending and not yet granted, and the latter excluded [[discretionary appeal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/21760-abatement-ab-initio-and-a-crime-victims-right-to Abatement AB Initio and a Crime Victim’s Right to Restitution]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abatement ab initio was used to overturn the convictions of [[John Salvi]], [[Kenneth Lay]], and [[Aaron Hernandez]].

==Scholarship==

Over the last 20 years, Crary has explored the basis for and implications of the [[Ethics|moral dimension]] of language.

Crary's second book, [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674967816 ''Inside Ethics: On the Demands of Moral Thought''] (January 2016, Harvard University Press), discusses the nature and difficulty of moral thought about human beings and animals, addressing topics ranging from moral development to cognitive disability.  As noted in a contemporary [http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/68325-inside-ethics-on-the-demands-of-moral-thought/ review],

{{quote|Most contemporary ethicists assume that any objective representation of human and animal life must be developed outside of ethics, using the normatively neutral methods of, for example, the natural sciences. Crary, in contrast, argues that humans and animals have empirically observable moral characteristics, recognition of which is crucial to moral thought, but which are inaccessible to us when we limit ourselves to neutral methods. Good, "world-guided" moral thought, according to Crary, requires the use of capacities such as moral imagination, the exercise of which is elicited by methods (including various narrative techniques) that are characteristic of the arts and humanities. Works employing such methods contribute directly to moral understanding by drawing us into the imaginative exploration of other moral perspectives....Crary embarks on a radical re-visioning of objective reality as including, rather than excluding, moral values. The idea that reality includes objective moral values combines objectivism (the idea that moral judgments are essentially concerned with how things are) with internalism (the idea that moral judgments have direct bearing on our reasons for acting). The dominant stance in philosophical ethics, she points out, is to embrace a hard metaphysic that rejects one or both of these ideas. Crary identifies, as the unquestioned starting point for such a metaphysic, the "familiar and allegedly scientific worldview" (31) according to which the natural sciences have exclusive authority to tell us what reality is objectively like. A central part of [the book] is devoted to showing how both Peter Singer and Christine Korsgaard accept this starting point and embrace, in different ways, the hard metaphysic to which it leads.| A.C. Westlund, ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews 2016.07.13''|}}

Another [http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/HRO/reviews/content/292/ review] summarizes the main claims of ''Inside Ethics'' as follows:

{{quote|Among the theses that Crary propounds in service of her ultimate goal are: there are observable and essentially practical moral properties, objectively describing humans and animals requires an ethical sensitivity to those moral properties, being a human and being an animal are by themselves morally significant properties, and literature is an irreplaceable vehicle of moral reflection for grasping the moral significance of humans and other animals....She proposes what I would call a post-Romantic perspective that takes our possibilities for moral response to be equally affective and rational. Crary encourages us to take more seriously the moral thought of those engaged with the most vulnerable humans and animals. This seems to me of the highest importance and part of an expansive program for moral thought that demands further philosophical exploration.| John Hacker-Wright, ''Hypatia Online Reviews 292''|}}

While finishing her doctorate in philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh in the 1990s, she co-edited and wrote the introduction to ''[[The New Wittgenstein]]'', which continues to influence debates over Wittgenstein's philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;P.M.S.

Crary is a member of a number of international research groups devoted to subjects such as [[feminist philosophy]], [[ordinary language philosophy]], and [[critical theory]].

==Graduate students and teaching==
Crary currently directs eleven PhD theses in the Department of Philosophy at [[The New School for Social Research]], where she inaugurated and has led both the [http://events.newschool.edu/event/wittgenstein_workshop_raimond_gaita_politics_and_the_idea_of_evil# Wittgenstein Workshop] and a graduate student-oriented Works in Progress series.  She received The New School's University Distinguished Teaching Award in 2005.

Crary's international educational activities have focused on the intersection of philosophy with critical theory and political philosophy.  In the summer of 2014 she co-organized and taught the summer philosophy workshop at [[Humboldt University]] in [[Berlin, Germany]].  In July 2016, she served on the faculty of the [http://blogs.newschool.edu/tcds/democracy-diversity-institute-wroclaw-2016/democracy-diversity-institute-wroclaw-2016-faculty/ Transregional Center for Democratic Studies] at the 25th anniversary New School for Social Research Europe Democracy and Diversity Institute in [[Wroclaw, Poland]].

'''Amalric of Bena''' ({{lang-fr|Amaury de Bène, Amaury de Chartres}}; {{lang-la|Almaricus, Amalricus, Amauricus}}; died {{circa}} 1204&amp;ndash;1207 AD) was a [[France|French]] [[theology|theologian]] and [[sect]] leader, after whom the [[Amalricians]] are named.

==Biography==
Amalric was born in the latter part of the 12th century at Bennes, a village between [[Ollé]] and [[Chauffours]] in the [[diocese of Chartres]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Amalric taught philosophy and theology at the [[University of Paris]] and enjoyed a great reputation as a subtle [[dialectic]]ian; his lectures developing the [[philosophy of Aristotle]] attracted a large circle of hearers.  In 1204 his doctrines were condemned by the university and, on a personal appeal to [[Pope Innocent III]], the sentence was ratified, Amalric being ordered to return to Paris and recant his errors.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

His death was caused, it is said, by grief at the humiliation to which he had been subjected.
In 1209, ten of his followers were burnt before the gates of Paris and Amalric's own body was exhumed and burnt and the ashes given to the winds.  The doctrines of his followers, known as the [[Amalrician]]s, were formally condemned by the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Propositions==
Amalric appears to have derived his philosophical system from [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|Eriugena]], whose principles he developed in a one-sided and strongly [[pantheist]]ic form.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Three propositions only can with certainty be attributed to him:
#that God is all (''omnia sunt deus'') and thus all things are one because whatever is, is God (''omnia unum, quia quidquid est, est Deus'');
#that every Christian is bound to believe that he is a member of the body of Christ, and that this belief is necessary for salvation;
#that he who remains in love of God can commit no sin.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Because of the first proposition, God himself is thought as invisible and only recognizable in his creation.

These three propositions were further developed by his followers, who maintained that God revealed Himself in a threefold revelation, the first in the Biblical patriarch [[Abraham]], marking the ''epoch of the Father''; the second in [[Jesus Christ]], who began the ''epoch of the Son''; and the third in Amalric and his disciples, who inaugurated the ''era of the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]].''{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Amalricians taught:
*Hell is ignorance, therefore Hell is within all men, "like a bad tooth in a mouth";
*God is identical with all that is, even evil belongs to God and proves God's omnipotence;
*A man who knows that God works through everything cannot sin, because every human act is then the act of God;
*A man who recognizes the truth that God works through everything is already in Heaven and this is the only resurrection.  There is no other life; man's fulfilment is in this life alone.

Due to persecutions, this sect does not appear to have long survived the death of its founder.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Not long after the burning of ten of their members (1210), the sect itself lost its importance, while some of the surviving Amalricians became [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pinselpark.org/geschichte/einzel/p0375_mittelalter/r_haeresie.html (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Hosea Ballou]], then [[Pierre Batiffol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Apocatastasis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George T. Knight (Universalist)|George T. Knight]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc01.html?term=Apocatastasis Apocatastasis]". ''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol. I''.&lt;/ref&gt; (1914) Amalric was a believer that all people would eventually be saved and this was one of the counts upon which he was declared a heretic by [[Pope Innocent III]].

{{Sikh practices}}
Amrit Velā (Punjabi: ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ ਵੇਲਾ) (Time of Amrit) begins at the start of a new day, therefore, begins at 12:00 am and ends at 6:00 am, [1] or before the dawning of the morning sun[2] which is used for daily meditation and recitation of Gurbani hymns. Typically, Sikhs start Amrit Vela at 2:00 am or earlier. Guru Nanak in the Japji Sahib (4th Pauri) says, "During the hours of Amrit velā, meditate on the grandeur of the one true Name."[1] The importance of Amrit Vela is found throughout the Guru Granth Sahib. The Guru Granth Sahib states that "those who consider themselves a Sikh must wake up daily at Amrit Vela and be in tune with the Naam (the Lord's Name)"[3]

In the Sikh Rehat Maryada, it is written to arise Amrit Velā, bath, and meditate on the divine Naam (through Simran and Naam Japna). Sikhs recite their morning Nitnem during Amrit Vela. Traditionally after Nitnem Sikhs meet with the Sangat (congregation) to recite Asa di Var.[4]

'''André Gorz''' ([[Given name|né]] '''Gerhart Hirsch'''; born 9 February 1923 – 22 September 2007) more commonly known by his [[pen name|pen names]] '''Gérard Horst''' and '''Michel Bosquet''', was an Austrian [[Social philosophy|social philosopher]] and journalist. 

He co-founded ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'' weekly in 1964. A supporter of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s [[existentialist]] version of [[Marxism]] after the Second World War, he became in the aftermath of the [[May '68]] student riots more concerned with [[political ecology]].

In the 1960s and 1970s he was a main theorist in the [[New Left]] movement. His central theme was [[wage labour]] issues such as liberation from work, the just distribution of work, [[social alienation]], and a [[basic income|guaranteed basic income]].&lt;ref&gt;André Gorz, [http://societal.org/docs/55.htm Pour un revenu inconditionnel suffisant], published in TRANSVERSALES/SCIENCE-CULTURE (n° 3, 3e trimestre 2002) {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early years===

Born in [[Vienna]] as Gerhart Hirsch, he was the son of a [[Jew]]ish wood-salesman and of a [[Catholicism|Catholic]] mother, who came from a cultivated background and worked as a secretary. Although his parents did not have any strong sense of national or religious identity, the spreading [[anti-Semitism]] of the time led his father to convert to Catholicism in 1930. At the outbreak of [[World War II]] (1939), his mother sent him to an institution in [[Switzerland]] to avoid his mobilization into the [[Wehrmacht]]. Thereafter, Hirsch was a [[stateless person]] until 12 April 1957&lt;ref&gt;Willy Gianinazzi, ''André Gorz.

Working at first as a [[translation|translator]] of American short stories published by a Swiss editor, he published his first articles in a [[cooperative]] journal. In 1946 he met [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], with whom he became close. He was then mainly influenced by [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. Gorz contributed to the journals ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'' ([[Paris]]), ''New Left Review'', ''Technologie und Politik'' ([[Reinbek]]). In June 1949 Gorz moved to Paris, where he worked first at the international secretariat of the ''Mouvement des {{Interlanguage link multi|Citoyens du Monde|fr|3=Citoyens du Monde (association)}}'', then as private secretary of a [[military attaché]] of the embassy of India. He then entered ''[[Paris-Presse]]'' as a journalist, taking the pseudonym of ''Michel Bosquet''. There, he met with [[Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber]], who in 1955 recruited him as an economist journalist for ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]''.

Alongside his journalistic activities, Gorz worked closely with Sartre and adopted an [[existentialist]] approach to [[Marxism]], leading him to emphasize the questions of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and of [[liberty|liberation]] in the framework of existential experience and an analysis of social systems from the viewpoint of individual experience. This intellectual framework formed the basis of his first books, ''Le Traître'' (Le Seuil, 1958, prefaced by Sartre&lt;ref name=Figob&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/20070925.FIG000000166_le_philosophe_andre_gorz_et_sa_femme_se_sont_suicides.html Le philosophe André Gorz et sa femme se sont suicidés], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 25 September 2007 {{fr icon}}
&lt;/ref&gt;), ''La Morale de l'histoire'' (Le Seuil, 1959) and the ''Fondements pour une morale'' (Galilée, 1977, published fifteen years later), which he signed for the first time as André Gorz, from the German name of the now Italian city ''([[Gorizia|Görz]])'' where the eyeglasses given to his father by the Austrian Army were made.

===1960s–1980s===

Gorz also was a main theorist in the [[New Left]] movement, inspired by the [[young Marx]], discussions of humanism and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and the liberation of humanity. Gorz was also influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]], being a friend of [[Herbert Marcuse]]. Other friends of his included [[Rossana Rossanda]], founder of ''[[Il Manifesto]]'' newspaper, the photographer [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]], younger intellectuals such as [[Marc Kravetz]] or [[Tiennot Grumbach]]&lt;ref name=ML/&gt;, and [[Ronald Fraser (historian)|Ronald Fraser]] of the ''[[New Left Review]]''.

He strongly criticized [[structuralism]] because of its criticisms of the subject and of subjectivity. He called himself a "revolutionary-reformist", a [[democratic socialist]] who wanted to see system-changing reforms. In 1961, he entered the editorial committee of ''Les Temps Modernes'', introducing to French thought the Italian [[Sergio Garavini|Garavini]], the [[neo-Keynesianism|neo-Keynesian]] and Communist [[Bruno Trentin]], and the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Vittorio Foa]].&lt;ref&gt;On the relationship between Bruno Trentin and André Gorz, see W. Gianinazzi, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Imposing himself as the "intellectual leader of the 'Italian' tendency of the [[New Left]]" (Michel Contat&lt;ref&gt;Michel Contat, « Illustres inconnus et inconnus illustres : André Gorz », in ''[[Le Débat]]'', n° 50, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;), he influenced activists of the [[Union Nationale des Étudiants de France|UNEF]] students' union and of the [[CFDT]] (in particular [[Jean Auger]], [[Michel Rolant]] and [[Fredo Krumnow]]) as a theorist of [[workers' self-management]], recently embraced by the CFDT.{{Citation needed|date= May 2015}} His term "non-reformist reform" refers to proposed programs of change that base their demands on human needs rather than on the needs of the current economic system.&lt;ref name="BondWise2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1= Julian Bond|author2= Leah Wise|author3= Henry Durham|author4= Howard Romaine |author5= Robert Sherrill |author6= Derek Shearer|title= Military and the South|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CwFHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39|date= 30 January 2013|page= 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He directly addressed himself to trade-unions in ''Stratégie ouvrière et néocapitalisme'' (Le Seuil, 1964), where he criticized [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[economic growth]] and expounded on the various strategies open to trade-unions. The same year, he quit ''L'Express'' along with Serge Lafaurie, Jacques-Laurent Bost, K.S. Karol and [[Jean Daniel]] to found ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'' weekly (using the pseudonym of Michel Bosquet).

Deeply affected by [[May '68]], Gorz saw in these events a confirmation of his existential-Marxist posture, which joined the students' criticisms towards institutional and state organization (State, School, Family, Firm, etc.). Thereafter, [[Ivan Illich]]'s thesis on education, medicine or the abolition of [[wage labour]] became the focus of his attention. He published one of Illich's speeches in ''Les Temps Modernes'' in 1961, before meeting him in 1971 in ''Le Nouvel Observateur'' at the occasion of his publication of ''Deschooling Society'' (''Une Société sans école''). He later published a resume of Illich's ''[[Tools for Conviviality]]'' (1973) under the title ''Libérer l'avenir'' (Free Future). His links with Illich strengthened after a trip to [[California]] in 1974, where he wrote several articles for ''Le Nouvel Observateur'' discussing Illich's thesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thierry Paquot]], [http://mondediplo.com/2003/01/15illich The Non-Conformist], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', January 2003 {{en icon}} ([http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2003/01/PAQUOT/9866 French version freely-available], and Portuguese and Esperanto translations available)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorz's evolution and political and philosophical stances led to some tensions with his colleagues on ''Les Temps Modernes'', for which he had assumed the chief editorial responsibilities in 1969. In April 1970, his article ''Destroy the University'' (''Détruire l'Université'') provoked the resignation of [[Jean-Bertrand Pontalis]] and [[Bernard Pingaud]]. Gorz also criticized a [[Maoism|Maoist]] tendency present in the journal since 1971 (and supported by Sartre). Finally, in 1974 Gorz resigned as the editor of ''Les Temps Modernes'', following a disagreement concerning an article about the Italian [[autonomist]] group ''[[Lotta Continua]]''. At the same time, he found himself forced to the periphery of ''Le Nouvel Observateur'', being replaced by more classically oriented economists, while he followed at the same time a campaign against nuclear industry — to which [[Électricité de France|EDF]], the state electricity firm, replied by withdrawing advertisements from the weekly. Following the weekly's refusal to let him publish a special issue on the nuclear issue, he published it in the ''Que Choisir?'' consumers' magazine.

In the same period, Gorz was becoming a leading figure of [[political ecology]], his ideas being spread in particular by the ecologist monthly ''[[Le Sauvage]]'', founded by Alain Hervé, the founder of the French section of the [[Friends of the Earth]]. In 1975 he published ''Ecologie et politique'' (Galilée, 1975), which included the essay ''Ecologie et liberté'', "one of the foundational texts of the ecologic problematic" (Françoise Gollain&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Gollain, ''Pensée écologique et critique du travail dans une perspective gorzienne'', Orléans, Ph.D. en economic sciences, 1999, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;).

He was also influenced by [[Louis Dumont]] in considering Marxism and [[Liberalism]] to be two versions of economist thought. Gorz then opposed himself both to [[hedonist]] [[individualism]] and [[utilitarianism]] and to materialist and productivist [[collectivism]], defending a humanist version of ecology similar to [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]] which is opposed to [[deep ecology]]. Gorz's ecologism, however, remained linked to a critique of capitalism, as he called for an "ecological, social and cultural revolution which would abolish the constraints of Capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;[[French language|French]]: ''« révolution écologique, sociale et culturelle qui abolisse les contraintes du capitalisme''», quoted by Françoise Gollain, ''op. cit.'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s–2000s===
A year before the [[French presidential election, 1981|election]] of the left's candidate, [[François Mitterrand]], to the French presidency in 1981, Gorz published ''Adieux au prolétariat'' (Galilée, 1980 – Farewell to the Proletariat) where he criticized the cult of the [[proletarian]] class in Marxism, arguing that changes in science and technology now made it impossible for the working-class to be the sole, or even primary, revolutionary agent. Although the book was not well received among the [[French Left]], it did receive attention from younger readers. Soon after Sartre's death in that same year Gorz left the editorial board of ''Les Temps Modernes''. In ''Les Chemins du paradis'' (Galilée, 1983) Gorz remained critical of the Marxist orthodoxy of the time, using Marx's own analysis in the ''Grundrisse'' to argue for the need of the political left to embrace the liberatory potential that the increasing automation of factories and services offered as a central part of the socialist project. In 1983 he had a falling out with the [[pacifism|pacifist movement]]s when he refused to oppose the deployment of [[Pershing II]] missiles by the United States in West Germany. The same year, he resigned from ''Le Nouvel Observateur''. In the 1990s and 2000s, the journals ''[[Multitudes]]'', ''[[EcoRev']]'' which will publish the last article in French ''"la fin du capitalisme a déjà commencé"''&lt;ref&gt;See http://ecorev.org/spip.php?article641&lt;/ref&gt;
and ''Entropia'' published his articles.

Gorz was also critical of the [[post-structuralism]] and [[postmodernism]] of thinkers such as [[Antonio Negri]]. His point of view was rooted in early [[Marxist humanism|Marxist humanist]] thinking. Liberation from [[wage-slavery]] and [[social alienation]] remained one of his goals, even in his later works. He never became an abstract theorist; his reasoning usually concluded with proposals for how to act to make changes. In ''Métamorphoses du travail'' (Galilée, 1988 – Metamorphosis of Labour), Gorz argued that capitalism used personal investments from the worker which were not paid back. As such, he became an advocate of [[Basic income|Guaranteed basic income]], independent from "labour". He made such a proposal in his book, ''Critique of Economic Reason'', 1989, and argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"From the point where it takes only 1,000 hours per year or 20,000 to 30,000 hours per lifetime to create an amount of wealth equal to or greater than the amount we create at the present time in 1,600 hours per year or 40,000 to 50,000 hours in a working life, we must all be able to obtain a real income equal to or higher than our current salaries in exchange for a greatly reduced quantity of work. In practice, this means that in the future we must receive our full monthly income every month even if we work full-time only one month in every two or six months in a year or even two years out of four, so as to complete a personal, family or community project, or experiment with different lifestyles, just as we now receive our full salaries during paid holidays, training courses, possibly during periods of sabbatical leave, and so forth...".{{Quote without source|date=July 2018}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He pointed out that in

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"contrast to the guaranteed social minimum granted by the state to those unable to find regular paid work, our regular monthly income will be the normal remuneration we have earned by performing the normal amount of labour the economy requires each individual to supply. The fact that the amount of labour required is so low that work can become intermittent and constitute an activity amongst a number of others, should not be an obstacle to its being remunerated by a full monthly income throughout one's life. This income corresponds to the portion of socially produced wealth to which each individual is entitled by virtue to their participation in the social process of production. It is, however, no longer a true salary, since it is not dependent on the amount of labour supplied (in the month or year) and is not intended to remunerate individuals as workers".{{Quote without source|date=July 2018}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Death ====
Gorz and his wife, Dorine, committed suicide together in his home in Vosnon ([[Aube]]).  His wife had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and they had already said that neither wanted to survive the other's death. Their bodies were found on 24 September 2007 by a friend, both having died after a [[lethal injection]].&lt;ref name=Figob/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[[Agence France Press|AFP]], "French philosopher commits suicide with wife," 25 September 2007 [http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gjWhcNZrlESesEMdHb_hDiVUXltQ on-line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703014627/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gjWhcNZrlESesEMdHb_hDiVUXltQ |date=3 July 2013 }} {{en icon}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
His book ''Lettre à D. Histoire d'un amour'' (Galilée, 2006) was dedicated to his wife, and was in fact a way for him to tell of the love he had for her.

[[File:English Bible translations.jpg|thumb|English Bible translations]]

Partial [[Bible translations]] into [[English language|languages of the English people]] can be traced back to the late [[7th century]], including translations into [[Old English|Old]] and [[Middle English]]. More than 450 translations into English have been written.

The [[New Revised Standard Version]] is the version most commonly preferred by [[biblical scholars]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://courses.missouristate.edu/markgiven/rel102/bt.htm A Discussion of Bible Translations and Biblical Scholarship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904041222/http://courses.missouristate.edu/markgiven/rel102/bt.htm |date=2016-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, 55% of survey respondents who read the Bible reported using the [[King James Version]] in 2014, followed by 19% for the [[New International Version]], with other versions used by fewer than 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.raac.iupui.edu/files/2713/9413/8354/Bible_in_American_Life_Report_March_6_2014.pdf |title=The Bible in American Life |access-date=2014-09-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530005014/http://www.raac.iupui.edu/files/2713/9413/8354/Bible_in_American_Life_Report_March_6_2014.pdf |archive-date=2014-05-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old English==
{{main|Old English Bible translations}}
Although [[John Wycliffe]] is often credited with the first translation of the Bible into English, there were in fact many translations of large parts of the Bible centuries before Wycliffe's work. Parts of the Bible was first translated from the [[Latin Vulgate]] into Old English by a few select monks and scholars. Such translations were generally in the form of prose or as [[interlinear gloss]]es (literal translations above the Latin words). 

Very few complete translations existed during that time. Most of the books of the Bible existed separately and were read as individual texts. Thus the sense of the Bible as history that often exists today did not exist at that time. Instead, an [[Allegorical interpretation of the Bible|allegorical rendering of the Bible]] was more common and translations of the Bible often included the writer’s own commentary on passages in addition to the literal translation.

Toward the end of the 7th century, the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]] began a translation of scripture into Old English.  [[Aldhelm]] (c. 639–709) translated the complete [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] and large portions of other scriptures into Old English.

In the 10th century an [[Old English language|Old English]] translation of the Gospels was made in the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]]: a word-for-word gloss inserted between the lines of the Latin text by [[Aldred the Scribe|Aldred]], Provost of [[Chester-le-Street]].&lt;ref name="sunderland"&gt;{{cite web|author=Published on Friday 22 September 2006 16:47 |url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/local/let_gospels_come_home_1_1124495 |title=Let Gospels come home - All News |publisher=Sunderland Echo |date=2006-09-22 |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the oldest extant translation of the Gospels into the [[English language]].&lt;ref name="sunderland" /&gt;

The ''[[Wessex Gospels]]'' (also known as the ''West-Saxon Gospels'') are a full translation of the four [[gospels]] into a West Saxon dialect of Old English. Produced in approximately 990, they are the first translation of all four gospels into English without the [[Latin language|Latin]] text.

In the 11th century, Abbot [[Ælfric of Eynsham|Ælfric]] translated much of the [[Old Testament]] into Old English. The ''[[Old English Hexateuch]]'' is an [[illuminated manuscript]] of the first six books of the Old Testament (the [[Hexateuch]]).

Another copy of that text, without lavish illustrations but including a translation of the Book of Judges (hence also called the '''Old English Heptateuch'''), is found in Oxford, Bodleian Library, Laud Misc. 509.

==Middle English==
{{main|Middle English Bible translations}}
The [[Ormulum]] is in Middle English of the 12th century. Like its Old English precursor from [[Ælfric of Eynsham|Ælfric]], an Abbot of Eynsham, it includes very little Biblical text, and focuses more on personal commentary. This style was adopted by many of the original English translators. For example, the story of the [[Wedding at Cana]] is almost 800 lines long, but fewer than 40 lines are the actual translation of the text. An unusual characteristic is that the translation mimics Latin verse, and so is similar to the better known and appreciated 14th-century English poem, [[Cursor Mundi]].

[[Richard Rolle]] (1290–1349) wrote an English Psalter. Many religious works are attributed to Rolle, but it has been questioned how many are genuinely from his hand. Many of his works were concerned with personal devotion, and some were used by the [[Lollards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|id=13119a|title=Richard Rolle de Hampole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 14th century theologian [[John Wycliffe]] is credited with translating what is now known as [[Wycliffe's Bible]], though it is not clear how much of the translation he himself did.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, William. 2003. "Wycliffe, John.” ''English Language Bible Translators'', p.&amp;nbsp;264. Jefferson, NC and London: McFarland and Company&lt;/ref&gt; This translation  came out in two different versions. The earlier text is characterised by a strong adherence to the word order of Latin, and might have been difficult for the layperson to comprehend. The later text made more concessions to the native grammar of English.

==Early Modern and Modern English==
{{main|Early Modern English Bible translations|Modern English Bible translations}}

[[File:St. Thomas Hospital (3984337187).jpg|thumb|The site of [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in [[London]] was where the first modern English [[Bible]] was printed in England. (Note the error in the inscription: [[Miles Coverdale]]'s Bible, 1535 pre-dated this).]]
Early Modern English Bible translations are of between about 1500 and 1800, the period of [[Early Modern English]]. This, the first major period of Bible translation into the English language, began with the introduction of the [[Tyndale Bible]]. The first complete edition of his New Testament was in 1526. [[William Tyndale]] used the Greek and Hebrew texts of the New Testament (NT) and Old Testament (OT) in addition to [[Jerome]]'s Latin translation. He was the first translator to use the [[printing press]] – this enabled the distribution of several thousand copies of his New Testament translation throughout England. Tyndale did not complete his Old Testament translation. 

The first printed English translation of the whole bible was produced by [[Miles Coverdale]] in 1535, using Tyndale's work together with his own translations from the Latin Vulgate or German text. After much scholarly debate it is concluded that this was printed in Antwerp and the colophon gives the date as 4th October 1535. This first edition was adapted by Coverdale for his first "authorised version", known as the [[Great Bible]], of 1539. Other early printed versions were the [[Geneva Bible]] (1560), notable for being the first Bible divided into verses and which negated the Divine Right of Kings; the [[Bishop's Bible]] (1568), which was an attempt by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] to create a new authorised version; and the [[King James Version|Authorized King James Version]] of 1611.

The first complete [[Roman Catholic]] Bible in English was the [[Douay–Rheims Bible]], of which the New Testament portion was published in [[Rheims]] in 1582 and the Old Testament somewhat later in [[Douay]] in [[Gallicant Flanders]].  The Old Testament was completed by the time the New Testament was published, but due to extenuating circumstances and financial issues was not published until nearly three decades later, in two editions, the first released in 1609, and the rest of the OT in 1610. In this version, the seven [[deuterocanonical books]] are mingled with the other books, rather than kept separate in an appendix.

While early English Bibles were generally based on a small number of Greek texts, or on Latin translations, modern English translations of the Bible are based on a wider variety of manuscripts in the original languages (Greek and Hebrew).  The translators put much scholarly effort into cross-checking the various sources such as the [[Septuagint]], [[Textus Receptus]], and [[Masoretic Text]].  Relatively recent discoveries such as the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] provide additional reference information. There is some controversy over which texts should be used as a basis for translation, as some of the alternate sources do not include phrases (or sometimes entire verses) which are found only in the Textus Receptus.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''New International Version'', the ''Revised Standard Version'', The ''New King James Version'' and the ''New American Standard Version'' of the Bible.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some{{who|date=August 2014}} say the alternate sources were poorly representative of the texts used in their time, whereas others{{who|date=August 2014}} claim the Textus Receptus includes passages that were added to the alternate texts improperly.  These controversial passages are not the basis for disputed issues of doctrine, but tend to be additional stories or snippets of phrases. Many modern English translations, such as the [[New International Version]], contain limited text notes indicating where differences occur in original sources.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''New International Version'', the ''Revised Standard Version'', The ''New King James Version'' and the ''New American Standard Version'' of the Bible.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A somewhat greater number of textual differences are noted in the [[New King James Bible]], indicating hundreds of New Testament differences between the [[Nestle-Aland]], the [[Textus Receptus]], and the Hodges edition of the [[Majority Text]].  The differences in the Old Testament are less well documented, but do contain some references to differences between consonantal interpretations in the Masoretic Text, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Septuagint.  Even with these hundreds of differences, however, a more complete listing is beyond the scope of most single volume Bibles (see Critical Translations below).

Modern translations take different approaches to the rendering of the original languages of approaches. The approaches can usually be considered to be somewhere on a scale between the two extremes:
* [[Formal equivalence]] translation (sometimes [[literal translation]] or [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|formal correspondence]]) in which the greatest effort is made to preserve the meaning of individual words and phrases in the original, with relatively less regard for its understandability by modern readers.

* [[Dynamic equivalence]], sometimes called [[Paraphrase|Paraphrastic]] translation, in which the translator attempts to render the sense and intent of the original. Examples include , [[The Living Bible]] and [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]].

Some translations have been motivated by a strong theological distinctive, such as the conviction that God's name be preserved in a Semitic form, seen in [[Sacred Name Bibles]]. The [[Purified Translation of the Bible]] promotes the idea that Jesus and early Christians did not drink wine, but grape juice.{{fact|date=February 2018}} The [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]' ''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]]'' renders the [[tetragrammaton]] as ''Jehovah'' throughout the Old Testament; it also uses the form ''Jehovah'' in the New Testament, including but not limited to passages quoting the Old Testament, even though it does not appear in the Greek text.

===Individual translations===
{{Bible related}}
While most translations are made by committees of scholars in order to avoid bias or idiosyncrasy, translations are sometimes made by individuals. The translation of [[John Bertram Phillips|J.B. Phillips]] (1958), [[The Bible in Living English]] (1972) by Stephen T. Byington, J.N. Darby's [[Darby Bible]] (1890), [[Messianic Bible translations|Heinz Cassirer's translation]] (1989), [[Ronald Knox|R.A. Knox]] (1950), Gerrit Verkuyl's [[Berkeley Version]] (1959), The [[Messianic Bible translations|Complete Jewish Bible]] (1998) by Dr. [[David H. Stern]], Robert [[Young's Literal Translation]] (1862), Jay P.[[Green's Literal Translation]] (1985), The [[Emphatic Diaglott]] by Benjamin Wilson (1864), Noah [[Webster's Bible Translation]] (1833), The Original Aramaic Bible in Plain English (2010) by David Bauscher,  American King James Version (1999) by Michael Engelbrite, [[The Living Bible]] (1971) by Kenneth N. Taylor, The Modern Reader's Bible (1914) by Richard Moulton, The Five Pauline Epistles, A New Translation (1900) by William Gunion Rutherford, Joseph Bryant Rotherham's [[Emphasized Bible]] (1902), Professor S. H. Hooke's The [[Bible in Basic English]] (1949), The Holy Name Bible containing the Holy Name Version of the Old and New Testaments (1963) by [[Angelo Traina]], and [[Eugene H. Peterson]]'s [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]] (2002), and Father Nicholas King's translation of the Greek Bible into English, are largely the work of individual translators. Others, such as [[Robert Alter]], [[N. T. Wright]] and [https://laybibleblog.wordpress.com/ Dele Ikeorha]  have translated portions of the Bible.

===Alternative approaches===
Most translations make the translators' best attempt at a single rendering of the original, relying on footnotes where there might be alternative translations or textual variants. An alternative is taken by the [[Amplified Bible]]. In cases where a word or phrase admits of more than one meaning the Amplified Bible presents all the possible interpretations, allowing the reader to choose one. For example, the first two verses of the Amplified Bible read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the beginning God (Elohim) created [by forming from nothing] the heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and void ''or'' a waste and emptiness, and darkness was upon the face of the deep [primeval ocean that covered the unformed earth]. The Spirit of God was moving (hovering, brooding) over the face of the waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=1&amp;chapter=1&amp;version=45 |title=Genesis 1 AMP - In the beginning God (prepared, formed |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Single source translations===
While most translations attempt to synthesize the various texts in the original languages, some translations also translate one specific textual source, generally for scholarly reasons. A single volume example for the Old Testament is ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible'' ({{ISBN|0-06-060064-0}}) by Martin Abegg, Peter Flint and Eugene Ulrich.

''The Comprehensive New Testament'' ({{ISBN|978-0-9778737-1-5}}) by T. E. Clontz and J. Clontz presents a scholarly view of the New Testament text by conforming to the Nestle-Aland 27th edition and extensively annotating the translation to fully explain different textual sources and possible alternative translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rice |first=Joyce |title=The Comprehensive New Testament |date= 9 January 2009 |publisher=Forewordreviews.com |type=Book review |url=https://www.forewordreviews.com/reviews/the-comprehensive-new-testament/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317033704/https://www.forewordreviews.com/reviews/the-comprehensive-new-testament/ |archivedate=2014-03-17 |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Haines |first= Alastair |title=The Comprehensive New Testament, Clontz, T.

''A Comparative Psalter'' ({{ISBN|0-19-529760-1}}) edited by John Kohlenberger presents a comparative diglot translation of the Psalms of the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint, using the Revised Standard Version and the New English Translation of the Septuagint.

R. A. [[Knox's Translation of the Vulgate]] into English is another example of a single source translation.

=== Jewish translations ===
{{main|Jewish English Bible translations}}
Jewish English Bible translations are [[modern English Bible translations]] that include the books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]) according to the [[masoretic text]], and according to the traditional division and order of [[Torah]], [[Nevi'im]], and [[Ketuvim]].

Jewish translations often also reflect traditional Jewish interpretations of the Bible, as opposed to the Christian understanding that is often reflected in non-Jewish translations. For example, Jewish translations translate עלמה ''‘almâh'' in [[Isaiah 7:14]] as ''young woman'', while many Christian translations render the word as ''virgin''.

While modern biblical scholarship is similar for both Christians and Jews, there are distinctive features of Jewish translations, even those created by academic scholars. These include the avoidance of Christological interpretations, adherence to the [[Masoretic Text]] (at least in the main body of the text, as in the new [[Jewish Publication Society]] (JPS) translation) and greater use of classical Jewish exegesis. Some translations prefer names transliterated from the Hebrew, though the majority of Jewish translations use the Anglicized forms of biblical names.

The first English Jewish translation of the Bible into English was by [[Isaac Leeser]] in the 19th century.

The JPS produced two of the most popular Jewish translations, namely the [[Jewish Publication Society of America Version|JPS ''The Holy Scriptures'' of 1917]] and the [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|NJPS ''Tanakh'']] (first printed in a single volume in 1985, second edition in 1999).

Since the 1980s there have been multiple efforts among Orthodox publishers to produce translations that are not only Jewish, but also adhere to Orthodox norms. Among these are [[The Living Torah and Nach]] by [[Aryeh Kaplan]] and others, the [[Torah]] and other portions in an ongoing project by [[Everett Fox]], and the [[ArtScroll]] Tanakh.

==Popularity==
The [[evangelical]] [[CBA (Christian trade association)|Christian Booksellers Association]] lists the most popular versions of the Bible sold by their members in the United States. Through 29 December 2012, the top 5 best selling translations (based on both dollar and unit sales) are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbaonline.org/nm/documents/bsls/bible_translations.pdf |title=CBA Best Sellers |publisher=CBAonline.org |date=Feb 2013 |accessdate=2013-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/699uJ1Zxq?url=http://www.cbaonline.org/nm/documents/BSLs/Bible_Translations.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[New International Version]]
# [[King James Version]]
# [[New Living Translation]]
# [[New King James Version]]
# [[English Standard Version]]

Sales are affected by denomination and religious affiliation. For example, the most popular [[Hebrew Bible|Jewish version]] would not compete with rankings of a larger audience. Sales data can be affected by the method of marketing. Some translations are directly marketed to particular denominations or local churches, and many Christian booksellers only offer [[Protestant Bible]]s, so books in other [[biblical canon]]s (such as [[Catholic Bible|Catholic]] and [[Christian biblical canons#Eastern canons|Orthodox]] Bibles) may not appear as high on the CBA rank.

A study published in 2014 by The Center for the Study of Religion and American Culture at Indiana University and Purdue University found that Americans read versions of the Bible as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Eekhoff Zylstra for Christianity Today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3176">The '''Buried Bodies Case''', also known as the '''Lake Pleasant Bodies Case''', was a [[New York (state)|New York]] [[court case]] in the mid-1970s in which lawyers Frank Armani and Francis Belge, citing [[attorney-client privilege]], refused to disclose the location of the bodies of two people murdered by their client, [[Robert Garrow]]. Armani and Belge did not disclose the identity of the bodies but it was assumed they were two girls missing from the area at that time.

Armani and Belge had represented Garrow in his trial for murdering an eighteen-year-old boy; during the trial, Garrow confidentially told the lawyers where he had hidden the bodies of the two girls. In discussions with the attorney [[prosecutor|prosecuting]] Garrow, the lawyers proposed a [[plea bargain]] where they would reveal the location of the bodies in return for Garrow being sentenced to life in a [[mental hospital]], but the [[prosecutor]] refused. While testifying in his own defense during the case, Garrow admitted to four murders, including those of the girls, and was convicted.&lt;ref name="tibbles-2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawrence Tibbles|title=The case of the buried bodies: legal ethics and what it means to be a lawyer|journal=Columbus Bar Lawyers Quarterly|date=Summer 2008|pages=10-11|url=http://www.cbalaw.org/_files/publications/lawyers-quarterly/The%20Case%20of%20the%20Buried%20Bodies%2C%20Legal%20Ethics%20and%20What%20it%20Means%20to%20Be%20a%20Lawyer.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belge was indicted for refusing to disclose the locations of the bodies, and Armani's bar association began a [[disbarment]] proceeding against him. Both were ultimately exonerated and their conduct was vindicated by the bar. Four years after his conviction, Garrow escaped from prison. Armani provided advice to the police which led to them finding Garrow hiding near the prison. Garrow, who was armed, was shot and killed.&lt;ref name=tibbles-2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name="radiolab.org"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.radiolab.org/story/the_buried_bodies_case/ | title = The Buried Bodies Case | publisher = New York Public Radio | work = Radiolab | date = 3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Changsong Provincial School''' is an historical [[Confucian]] school located in [[Changsong County]], [[North Phyongan Province]], [[North Korea]]. It is designated as one of the [[National Treasures of North Korea]].

The school was established in the early days of the [[Joseon Dynasty]]; one ridgepole has an inscription saying it was rebuilt in 1765. The School served as the first institution to teach children of the local aristocratic class feudalistic [[Confucianism]]. In the front of the building is the '''Myongryun Hall''' which has no walls; it has a façade 15.4 meters wide and is 5.6 meters long. At the back of the hall are two gabled houses that face each other, known as ''Tong-mu'' and ''So-mu''; these houses have double eaves built on a terraced base. The Taesong Hall which stands behind the two houses is also a gabled house with double eaves, measuring 11.15 meters wide by 7.1 meters long. It has “exquisitely dovetailed” pillars and roof brackets. The school complex "has unique features of composition and placement common to such buildings of those days, thus representing the contemporary architecture and management of Confucian schools".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Changsong Confucian School, Korea's Architectural Heritage |url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2013/201304/news02/20130402-24ee.html |newspaper=KCNA |location=Pyongyang |date=April 2, 2013 |accessdate=December 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012095927/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2013/201304/news02/20130402-24ee.html# |archive-date=2014-10-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2938">'''Compossibility''' is a philosophical concept from [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. According to Leibniz, a complete individual thing (for example a person) is characterized by all its properties, and these determine its relations with other individuals. The existence of one individual may contradict the existence of another. A possible world is made up of individuals that are '''compossible'''&amp;mdash;that is, individuals that can exist together. Leibniz indicates that a world is a set of compossible things, however, that a world is a kind of collection of things that God could bring into existence. For not even God can bring into existence a world in which there is some contradiction among its members or their properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-modal/&lt;/ref&gt;

When Leibniz speaks of a possible world, he means a set of compossible, finite things that God could have brought into existence if he were not constrained by the goodness that is part of his nature. The actual world, on the other hand, is simply that set of finite things that is instantiated by God, because it is greatest in goodness, reality and perfection. Naturally, the fact that we are here experiencing this world—the actual world—means that there is at least one possible world. In Leibniz's view, there are an infinite number of possible worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Gregory |year=1987 |title=Compossibility, Harmony, and Perfection in Leibniz |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=173–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' entry on Leibniz's Modal Metaphysics by Brandon C. Look, views on "compossibility" and the closely related [[best of all possible worlds]] argument are to be found  in ''On the Ultimate Origination of Things'', ''The Discourse in Metaphysics'', ''On Freedom'', and throughout his works. The term itself is found in ''The Philosophical Writings III'' [''Die philosophischen Schriften III''] when Leibniz writes to [[Louis Bourguet]].&lt;ref name="Leibniz's Modal Mechanics"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-modal/ | title = Leibniz's Modal Metaphysics | date = 2008-05-23 | accessdate = 2010-01-22 | publisher = ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' | location = Palo Alto, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alain Badiou]] borrows this concept in defining philosophy as the creation of a "space of compossibility" for heterogeneous [[truth]]s.

[[Gilles Deleuze]] uses it in ''Cinema II'' taking support from Leibniz's explanation of the [[problem of future contingents]].

'''Constitutional economics''' is a [[research program]] in [[economics]] and [[constitutionalism]] that has been described as explaining the choice "of alternative sets of legal-institutional-constitutional rules that constrain the choices and activities of economic and political agents". This extends beyond the definition of "the economic analysis of constitutional law" and is distinct from explaining the choices of economic and political agents within those rules, a subject of orthodox economics.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Van den Hauwe, 2005. "Constitutional Economics II," ''The Elgar Companion to Law and Economics'', pp. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=EtguKoWHUHYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA223&amp;=fals 223–24.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutional economics takes into account the significant impacts of political economic decisions as opposed to limiting analysis to economic relationships as functions of the dynamics of distribution of marketable goods and services. "The political economist who seeks to offer normative advice, must, of necessity, concentrate on the process or structure within which political decisions are observed to be made. Existing constitutions, or structures or rules, are the subject of critical scrutiny."&lt;ref name= "Buchanan1986"&gt;James M. Buchanan, 1986. [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1986/buchanan-lecture.html "The Constitution of Economic Policy,"] Nobel Prize lecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutional economics has been characterized as a practical approach to apply the tools of economics to constitutional matters. For example, a major concern of every nation is the proper allocation of available national economic and financial resources. The legal solution to this problem falls within the scope of constitutional economics.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Kirchnez, ''The Principles of Subsidiary in the Treaty on European Union: A Critique from a Perspective of Constitutional Economics'', 6 TUL. J.INT’L. &amp; COMP. L. 291, 293 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is to study the "compatibility of effective economic decisions with the existing constitutional framework and the limitations or the favorable conditions created by that framework".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, 2001. "Constitutional Economics and the Bank of Russia," ''Fordham Journal of Corporate and Financial Law'', 7(1), [http://law2.fordham.edu/publications/articles/600flspub9473.pdf p. 160.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:James Buchanan by Atlas network.jpg|220px|thumb|Constitutional economics was popularized by [[James M. Buchanan]], for which he received the 1986 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] (pictured here in September 2010)]]
The term "constitutional economics" was coined in 1982 by the U.S. economist Richard McKenzie to designate the main topic of discussion at a conference held in Washington D.C. Later, McKenzie's neologism was adopted by another American economist, [[James M. Buchanan]], as a name for a new academic sub-discipline. It was Buchanan's work on this sub-discipline that brought him the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] for his "development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making" in 1986. Constitutionalism has been the subject of criticism for its previous ignorance of economic issues but this criticism was taken into account by the development of constitutional economics. Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the [[state (polity)|state]] as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1986/buchanan.html|title=James M. Buchanan Jr. - Facts|author=|date=|website=nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This philosophical position is, in fact, the very subject matter of constitutional economics. A constitutional economics approach allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis, helping to avoid a one-dimensional understanding. Buchanan believes that a [[constitution]], intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions and to balance interests of the [[state (polity)|state]] and [[society]] against those of individuals and their constitutional rights to [[personal freedom]] and private [[happiness]].&lt;ref name="James Buchanan 1999, p. 314"&gt;James Buchanan, The Logical Foundations of Constitutional Liberty, Volume 1, Liberty Fund, Indianapolis, 1999, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutional economics draws substantial inspiration from the reformist attitude which is characteristic of [[Adam Smith]]’s vision, and that Buchanan’s concept can be considered the modern-day counterpart to what Smith called “the science of [[legislation]].” According to Buchanan the ethic of constitutionalism is a key for constitutional order and "may be called the idealized [[Kantian]] world" where the individual "who is making the ordering, along with substantially all of his fellows, adopts the moral law as a general rule for behaviour".&lt;ref name="James Buchanan 1999, p. 314"/&gt;

Buchanan's Nobel lecture quoted the work of the late 19th century Swedish economist [[Knut Wicksell]], who greatly influenced Buchanan's research: "If utility is zero for each individual member of the community, the total utility for the community cannot be other than zero." In epigraph to the chapter of Nobel lecture entitled "The Constitution of Economic Policy" Wicksell states that "whether the benefits of the proposed activity to the individual citizens would be greater than its cost to them, no one can judge this better than the individuals themselves."&lt;ref name= "Buchanan1986"/&gt;

Buchanan introduced rich cross-disciplinary concepts of "constitutional citizenship" and "constitutional anarchy". Constitutional anarchy is a modern policy that may be best described as actions undertaken without understanding or taking into account the rules that define the constitutional order. This policy is justified by references to strategic tasks formulated on the basis of competing interests regardless of their subsequent impact on political structure. At the same time Buchanan introduces the concept of "constitutional citizenship", which he designates as compliance of citizens with their constitutional rights and obligations that should be considered as a constituent part of the constitutional policy. Buchanan also outlines importance of protection of the moral principles underlying constitutional norms.

=== Ethics of constitutional citizenship ===

James Buchanan wrote that "the ethics of constitutional citizenship is not directly comparable to ethical behavior in interaction with other persons within the constraints imposed by the rules of an existing regime. An individual may be fully responsible, in the standard ethical sense, and yet fail to meet the ethical requirement of constitutional citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J. Logical Foundations of Constitutional Liberty. Vol. 1. Indianapolis, 1999. p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan considered the term "constitutionality" in the broad sense and applied it to families, firms and public institutions, but, first of all, to the state.

Buchanan emphasised that public policy cannot be considered in terms of [[distribution of wealth|distribution]], but is instead always a question of the choice over rules of the game that engender a pattern of exchange and distribution. Buchanan is largely responsible for the rebirth of political economy as a scholarly pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;Boettke, P.J. (1998). James M. Buchanan and the rebirth of political economy, in (S. Pressman and R. Holt, eds.), Against the Grain: Dissent in Economics, pp. 21–39, Aldershot, UK: Edward Elgar Publishing, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan's work in [[Public choice theory|public choice]] is often interpreted as the quintessential case of economic imperialism. However, as [[Amartya Sen]] has pointed out,&lt;ref&gt;Amartya Sen, in ''Economics and Sociology'', ch. 14, Princeton: Princeton University Press. p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan should not be identified with economic imperialism. Sen states that Buchanan has done more than most to introduce ethics, legal political thinking, and indeed social thinking into economics.&lt;ref&gt;Swedberg, R. (1990). ''Economics and Sociology: On Redefining Their Boundaries'', New Jersey: Princeton University Press. p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Crucial to understanding Buchanan's system of thought is the distinction he made between politics and policy. Politics is about the rules of the game, where policy is focused on strategies that players adopt within a given set of rules. “Questions about what are good rules of the game are in the domain of social philosophy, whereas questions about the strategies that players will adopt given those rules is the domain of economics, and it is the play between the rules (social philosophy) and the strategies (economics) that constitutes what Buchanan refers to as constitutional political economy”.&lt;ref&gt;"Where Economics and Philosophy Meet: Review of ''The Elgar Companion to Economics and Philosophy'' with responses from the authors", ''The Economic Journal'', 116 (June), 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Buchanan, along with a few other budding constitutional economists, launched the journal ''Constitutional Political Economy'' with the purpose of further researching and developing the discipline. Buchanan wrote the vanguard article entitled "The Domain of Constitutional Economics", establishing the bounds of the emerging study and cementing the various topics he developed in 1962 and 1986. Buchanan gave a technical definition of constitutional economics as the research program directed at the rules of institutions in which individuals make choices, along with the process of creating these rules. While ordinary economic inquiry focuses on the choices within the rules or the constraints imposed on the individuals, constitutional economics aims at the actual rules themselves, the choice among constraints. Individuals agree to place constraints on themselves in exchange for anticipated benefits, a similar to a [[social contract]] view of government.&lt;ref&gt;Van den Hauwe, Ludwig (1999). "Constitutional Economics," in ''The Elgar Companion to Law and Economics'' Second edition, edited by J. Backhaus. Edward Elgar Publishing Limited: Cheltenham, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as a market transaction occurs through voluntary, mutually beneficial exchange, so with political "exchanges" of rights and authority.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, James M. (1990). "The Domain of Constitutional Economics," ''Constitutional Political Economy'', 1(1): [http://www.walkerd.people.cofc.edu/400/Sobel/2A-8.%20Buchanan%20-%20Constitutional%20Economics.pdf  1–18].&lt;/ref&gt;

With this theory, politics becomes a form of exchange and is therefore worthy of economic analysis, thus establishing the formal beginning of constitutional economics. By the end of the article, Buchanan enters philosophical territory, almost verging on skepticism, saying that each individual must perceive phenomena through his particular "window" and agreement is impossible when everyone views reality from different windows. Due to radical individualism, constitutional economics can include only people who view the world through economic paradigms or windows, not idealistic, goal-driven paradigms.

==Positive constitutional economics==

Within positive constitutional economics, the tools or methods are unique from normal economic tools because of the [[cross-disciplinary]] nature of the program. The main tool of positive constitutional economics is "comparative institutional analysis", with four main elements:&lt;ref&gt;Voigt, Stephan (1997). "Positive Constitutional Economics: A Survey," Public Choice, 90(1/4): 11–53).&lt;/ref&gt; 
# The first element examines how certain constitutional rules arose and what factors caused the rules to be developed as a result of aggregated individual inputs. 
# The second element looks at how rules are distinguishable between individual and collective factors, though Voigt acknowledges this research method is rarely used.
# The third element is the possibilities of further constitutional (or rules) change. Any proposed change to constitutional constraints, or rules of constraints, are subject to economic scrutiny for their effects on efficiency and equity.
# The fourth element of positive constitutional economics examines the economic effects of developed or modified change to rules.
All economic analysis seeks to maximize efficiency, and constitutional economics is no exception. In the market, individuals maximize efficiency when both parties perceive a personal benefit, mutual exchange, and when resources go to their highest valued use. Market economy is today's reality, but it must be a "constitutional market economy" as a term introduced by Chief Justice of Indonesian Constitutional Court Jimly Asshiddiqie in his "Economic Constitution". The political process is one of exchange, only unlike the market, the resources exchanged are political, not material or financial. Therefore, political efficiency is political consent, or when all individuals in the community agree to the political structures.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, James M. (1988). "Contractarian Political Economy and Constitutional Interpretation," ''The American Economic Review'', 78(2): 135–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Constitutional economics mimics a traditional [[Social contract|contractarian]] political economy in its focus on the contract, or consent, between the governed and government. However, consent follows efficiency in markets while efficiency follows consent in politics.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Normative constitutional economics ==

Normative constitutional economics focuses on legitimizing the state and its actions as the best means of maximum efficiency and utility, judging conditions or rules that are efficient, and discerning and studying the political systems to maximize efficiency, where the outcome of collective choices are considered "fair", "just", or "efficient".
Once again, Buchanan dominates the normative discussion of constitutional economics, specifically how methodological individualism affects economic analysis.

By 1988, Buchanan's thought had matured since his speech in 1986. Both Buchanan and Stefan Voigt argue the foundational assumption of normative constitutional economics is that no single individual's goals or values can supersede the value of another's. Therefore, a universal, absolute social norm or goal is impossible. Since politics is a form of exchange, when individuals agree to exchange goods, they are acting rationally in their own perceived self-interest if the decision is voluntary and informed. With these criteria, any such agreement is "efficient" and therefore normatively ought to occur.

Methodological individualism leads Buchanan to the normative claim that a political theory very similar to that of [[John Rawls]] in his seminal 1971 work, ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', would best realize individuals' unique goals. Complete with a [[veil of ignorance]] and ''a priori'' decisions of social goals, Buchanan says political economy does not have a social engineer or moral purpose but only assists individuals in their search for rules that best serve their individual purposes. For Buchanan, the "good" society is one that furthers the interests of individuals, not some independent moral or teleological end.

=== Hayek ===

Buchanan is not the only contributor to normative constitutional economics. Economic polymath [[Friedrich Hayek]] also wrote extensively on the topic of constitutional economics, even if he did not name constitutional economics specifically. Hayek defends a representative [[constitutional democracy]] as the best structure of government.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, Friedrich A. (1973). ''Law, Legislation, and Liberty'', Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek's main project was the vindication of freedom and establishing criteria for a regime of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, Friedrich A. (1960). ''The Constitution of Liberty'', Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek was worried by the kind of state that Buchanan/Rawls deemed normative. Hayek thought it necessary for a return to the traditional views of government, human nature, political philosophy, and economics. He believed the Buchanan/Rawls state had the almost inevitable propensity to totalitarianism as the state seeks to maximize individual utility. People would soon be at the mercy of para-government bureaucracy of the provision-state.

Hayek cautions his readers against rashly launching into the kind of state Rawls and Buchanan conceive, saying individual choice cannot be the only determining factor in the choices of constraints, and the actual structure of the rules or constraints (the constitution) must conform to what Buchanan would label a supra-individual goal. For Hayek, liberal constitutional democracies are the best way to achieve the goal of individual freedom, equality, opportunity, and efficiency for three reasons. First, constitutions codify pre-existing (presumably efficient) law. Second, they place explicit constraints on government to prevent totalitarianism. Finally, they preserve law and order for the polis. All of this is within the framework of a moral and teleological order.

==Economic analysis of the US Constitution==

The generally accepted birth of constitutional economic analysis of US Constitution was [[Charles Austin Beard]]'s landmark 1913 book ''[[An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States]]''.&lt;ref name= "Beard1913"&gt;Beard, Charles A. (1913). ''An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States'', New York: Macmillan Publishing Co, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; While most scholars today reject Beard's overall thesis, he initiated a new method of economic and political thought that would evolve into contemporary constitutional economics analysis.&lt;ref name=voigt97&gt;Voigt, Stephan (1997). ''Positive Constitutional Economics: A Survey'', Public Choice, 90(1/4): 11–53).&lt;/ref&gt; Beard's main thesis was that the [[U.S. Constitution]] "was essentially an economic document based upon the concept that the fundamental private rights of property are anterior to government and morally beyond the reach of popular majorities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beard|first1=Charles|title=An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States|date=1935 [1913]|publisher=MacMillan|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1987 for the [[Yale Law School]], Jonathan Macey synthesizes the history of constitutional economic analysis applied to the US Constitution. Macey offers a different analysis of the US Constitution and responds critically to Beard's view of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Macey, Jonathan R. (1987). "Competing Economic Views of the Constitution," Faculty Scholarship Series, 56(50): 50–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Macey understood Beard a famous and crucial part of the Constitution, [[separation of powers]], was actually a means of allowing hegemony of resources in the hands of the rich few. Macey could not disagree more; he argues that the Constitution and separation of powers were created to hinder aggregate political and economic power. He points to [[Federalist No. 10]], [[James Madison]]'s famous description of the necessity of factions due to the truths of human nature.

=== Separation of powers ===

Macey says this conception of human nature is essentially economic. If government is not separated into distinct powers, the possibility of extensive [[rent-seeking]] threatens the efficiency of the government. Self-interested groups or individuals will lobby to political powers for their goals, possibly leading to injustice or inefficiency. In Macey's interpretation of Madison, the [[separation of powers]] channels lobbyists into the competitive, more efficient market by raising transaction costs so much that private market means are less expensive than appealing to the various separate powers of government.

Macey demonstrates how constitutional economics can be applied to constitutions. Rather than looking at the political or philosophic intentions of the founders, the constitutional economist looks at a constitution through economic eyes, considering the incentives, choices, allocations, and other economics factors within the political rules of a constitution. Traditionally, the creation of factions has been interpreted as a brilliant political move to separate power and prevent hegemony of the state. Macey agrees but adds a caveat. He maintains a real economic incentive to factions existed which compelled the Founders to separate government.

Factions and separated powers raise transaction costs of mobilizing political support beyond what interest groups can pay if they rely on private, non-governmental means. Macey even graphs the quantity of legislation on a standard supply-demand curve, where the demand is the interest groups’ desire for laws and the supply is the legislation’s provision. Separation of powers shifts the supply curve left, raising the price and decreasing the quantity of legislation. Macey admits that though the US Constitution is imperfect, he does vindicate it from the purely material accusations of Beard. He examines a political system of constraints using standard economic methods.

==Legal approach==
Judge [[Richard Posner]] emphasized the importance of a constitution for
[[economic development]]. He examines the interrelationship between a constitution and the economic growth. Posner approaches constitutional analysis mainly from the perspective of judges, who constitute a critical force for interpretation and implementation of a constitution, thus—''[[de facto]]'' in [[common law]] countries—creating the body of constitutional law. He emphasizes the importance of constitutional provisions "in setting broader outer bounds to the exercise of judicial discretion". Thus, a judge, when trying a case, is guided firstly by the spirit and letter of the constitution. The role of economics in this process is to help "identify the consequences of alternative interpretations" of the constitution.

He then explains that "economics may provide insight into questions that bear on the proper legal interpretation". In the end, as Posner emphasizes, "the limits of an economic approach to deciding constitutional cases [are] set by the Constitution". In addition, he argues that "effective protection of basic [[economic rights]] promotes economic growth".&lt;ref&gt;Posner R., 1987. "The Constitution as an Economic Document," ''George Washington Law Review'',  56(1), p [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/gwlr56&amp;div=9&amp;id=&amp;page= p. 4]–38. Reprinted in J. W. Ely, ed., 1997, ''Main Themes in the Debate over Property Rights'', pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OdVyiw1ANycC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 186–220.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrently with the rise of academic research in the field of constitutional economics in the US in the 1980s, the [[Supreme Court of India]] for almost a decade had been encouraging [[public interest litigation]] on behalf of the poor and oppressed by using a very broad interpretation of several articles of the [[Indian Constitution]]. The former Chief Justice of Indonesian Constitutional Court, Jimly Asshiddiqie, also published his book "Konstitusi Ekonomi" (2010) in promoting the idea of Economic Constitution. This is a vivid example of a ''de facto'' practical application of the methodology of constitutional economics.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Cooper, ''Poverty and Constitutional Justice'', in ''Philosophy of Law: Classic and Contemporary Readings'', edited by Larry May and Jeff Brown, Wiley-Blackwell, UK, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The President of the [[Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation]], [[Valery Zorkin]], made a special reference to the educational role of constitutional economics: "In Russia, the addition of such new academic disciplines as constitutional economics to the curricula of university law and economics departments becomes critically important."&lt;ref&gt;Valery Zorkin, ''Twelve Theses on Legal Reform in Russia'' in ''The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform'', edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian school==
The Russian school of constitutional economics was created in the early twenty-first century with the idea that constitutional economics allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis in the legislative (especially budgetary) process, thus helping to overcome arbitrariness in the economic and financial decision-making.  For instance, when military expenses (and the like) dwarf the budget spending on education and culture. Constitutional economics studies such issues as the proper national wealth distribution. This also includes the government spending on the [[judiciary]], which in many transitional and [[developing countries]] is completely controlled by the [[executive (government)|executive]].

The latter undermines the principle of [[checks and balances]], instrumental in the [[separation of powers]], as this creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. It is important to distinguish between the two methods of [[political corruption|corruption]] of the judiciary: the state corruption (through budget planning and various privileges being the most dangerous), and the private corruption. The former makes it almost impossible for any business to facilitate the optimal growth and development of national market economy. In the English language, the word "constitution" possesses a whole number of meanings, encompassing not only national constitutions as such but also charters of corporations, unwritten rules of various clubs, informal groups, etc.

The Russian model of constitutional economics, originally intended for transitional and developing countries, focuses entirely on the concept of constitution of a state. This model of the constitutional economics is based on the understanding that it is necessary to narrow the gap between practical enforcement of the [[economic, social and cultural rights|economic, social]], and political rights granted by the constitution and the annual (or midterm) economic policy, budget legislation and administrative policies conducted by the government. In 2006, the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] officially recognized constitutional economics as a separate academic sub-discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova."[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia, in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform]", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since in many countries with transitional political and economic systems, their constitutions are often treated by the ruling elite as abstract legal documents totally disconnected from the economic policy of the state, the practice of constitutional economics becomes there a decisive prerequisite for the democratic development of both the state and society.

Not all scholars embrace constitutional economics. [[Walter Block]] and [[Thomas DiLorenzo]] make a strong criticism of constitutional economics as even a possible science. They maintain that politics cannot be equated with the market and, therefore, as a study, it cannot exist.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Walter and Thomas J. DiLorenzo (2000). "Is Voluntary Government Possible? A Critique of Constitution Economics," ''Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics'' 156(4): 567–82.&lt;/ref&gt; They maintain that unlike the market, consent is not the foundation of politics, and that politics is driven by violent, historically bellicose, coercion. Therefore, they believe that the CE method only clouds the discussion of public choice and political economy. Buchanan, Voigt, Macey, and even Beard all at least implicitly assume that politics is the exchange of political "goods", a strong social contract view.

But for Block and DiLorenzo, politics is one powerful group coercing free rides from a weaker group. From the [[Roman Empire]] to the present, they trace how the state always comes from conquest and exploitation, never consent. ''[[The Calculus of Consent]]'', a foundational text for constitutional economics, bears much of their attack. If they are correct that no state has been or can be voluntary and that voluntary government is inherently contradictory, constitutional economics as a discipline cannot exist.

William Campbell explains the weakness of constitutional economics in its assumption that the goal of a regime must be efficiency, individual liberty, and libertarian rights, not morality or super-individual good.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, William (1988). “Constitutional Economics: Ancients vs. Moderns,” The Heritage Foundation, Speech given July 27, 1988. Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cosmon''' or '''Cosmonium''' is a hypothetical form of matter where the Universe would have been in a dense form of matter as a particle named Cosmon. The idea was originally proposed by [[Georges Lemaître]] who suggested the idea of a 'primeval atom’ (''L'Hypothèse de l'Atome Primitif'') 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lemaître |first=Georges |date=1946 |title=L'Hypothèse de l'Atome Primitif |trans-title=Hypothesis of the Primal Atom

Its density would be around &lt;math&gt;10^{15}\text{g cm}^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kragh |first=Helge |editor-first1=Holder |editor-last1=D.

The idea of a primeval “super-atom” lived on and was developed forward by [[Maurice Goldhaber]] in 1956. In his proposal there would have been a point, which had been called a Universon, that would have collapsed into a Cosmon and an Anticosmon pair. Goldhaber was wondering about why is there any matter if equal amount of matter and antimatter was formed in the beginning of the big bang. One explanation for this is the [[Baryogenesis|asymmetry]] of matter meaning that there could have been slightly more matter than antimatter, for instance 1001 matter particles to every 1000 antimatter. In Goldhabers model cosmon and anticosmon would have flown apart and therefore explaining issue without asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Goldhaber | first=Maurice | date=1956-08-03| title=Speculations on Cosmogony | url =http://www.sciencemag.org/content/124/3214/218.short | journal =Science | publisher =American Association for the Advancement of Science| volume=124 | issue=3214 | pages=218–219 | bibcode= | doi=10.1126/science.124.3214.218| issn=0036-8075| access-date= | pmid=17838075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 [[Hans Dehmelt]] attempted to modernize the idea of the primeval atom. In this hypothesis, Cosmonium would have been the heaviest form of matter at the beginning of the big bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Dehmelt| first=Hans | date=1990-07-01| title=Experiments with an isolated subatomic particle at rest | url =http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.62.525 | journal =Reviews of Modern Physics | publisher =American Physical Society| volume=62 | issue=3| pages=218–219 | bibcode = 1990RvMP...62..525D| doi =10.1103/RevModPhys.62.525 | issn=| access-date=

Don '''Crescas Vidal''' was a French Talmudist in the first half of the fourteenth century.

==Biography==
Vidal was probably born in Spain.&lt;ref name="je"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4756-crescas-don-vidal-of-perpignan|author=[[Louis Ginzberg]], [[A. Peiginsky]] | title = CRESCAS, (DON) VIDAL, OF PERPIGNAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vidal went to [[Perpignan]], [[France]] shortly before the outbreak of the [[Maimonides#Influence|Maimonidian controversy]], as acculturated Jews continued to synthesize Aristotelian thought with traditional Jewish philosophy. Vidal was neutral in this controversy, despite the efforts of his brother Don [[Bonafos Vidal]] of [[Barcelona]], and of [[Solomon ben Adret]], to induce him to reject the new philosophical movement. Although he himself was strictly orthodox, Vidal was sympathetic toward the movement. He believed that while the young should be taught to study the Talmud, they should also have full liberty in the study of philosophy and science. Hence, he incurred the reproach of the orthodox when he emphatically sided with his friend [[Samuel Sulami]], who had given shelter to the ostracized philosopher [[Levi ben Abraham of Villefranche]]. Although Vidal did not openly espouse the cause of the unfortunate philosopher, his letters show how deeply he sympathized with him.&lt;ref&gt;(Gross, "Gallia Judaica," p. 464)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="je"/&gt;

'''Crime science''' is the study of [[crime]] in order to find ways to prevent it. Three features distinguish crime science from criminology: it is single-minded about cutting crime, rather than studying it for its own sake; accordingly it focuses on crime rather than criminals; and it is multidisciplinary, notably recruiting scientific methodology rather than relying on social theory.

Crime science in the United Kingdom was conceived by the British broadcaster [[Nick Ross]] in the late 1990s (with encouragement from the then Commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Police]], Sir John Stevens and Professor Ken Pease) out of concern that traditional criminology and orthodox political discourse were doing little to influence the ebb and flow of crime (e.g. Ross: Police Foundation Lecture, London, 11 July 2000 (jointly with Sir John Stevens); [[Parliamentary and Scientific Committee]], 22 March 2001; Barlow Lecture, UCL, 6 April 2005). Ross described crime science as, "examining the chain of events that leads to crime in order to cut the weakest link" ([[Royal Institution]] Lecture 9 May 2002).

==Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science==
The first incarnation of crime science was the founding, also by Ross, of the [[Jill Dando Institute]] of Crime Science (JDI) at [[University College London]] in 2001. In order to reflect its broad disciplinary base, and its departure from the sociological (and often politicised) brand of criminology, the Institute is established in the Engineering Sciences Faculty, with growing ties to the physical sciences such as physics and chemistry but also drawing on the fields of [[statistics]], environmental design, [[psychology]], [[forensics]], policing, [[economics]] and [[geography]].

The JDI grew rapidly and spawned a new Department of Security and Crime Science, which itself developed into one of the largest departments of its type in the world. It has established itself as a world-leader in [[crime mapping]] and for training crime analysts (civilian crime profilers who work for the police) and its Centre for the Forensic Sciences has been influential in debunking bad science in criminal detection. It established the world's first secure data lab for security and crime pattern analysis and appointed the world's first Professor of Future Crime whose role is to horizon-scan to foresee and forestall tomorrow's crime challenges. The JDI also developed a Security Science Doctoral Research Training Centre (UCL SECReT), which was Europe’s largest centre for doctoral training in security and crime science.

==Design Against Crime Research Centre==
Another branch of crime science has grown from its combination with [[design science]]. At the [[Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design]] a research centre was founded with the focus of studying how design could be used as a tool against crime - the [http://www.designagainstcrime.com/ Design against Crime Research Centre]. A number of practical theft-aware design practices have emerged there. Examples are chairs with a hanger that allows people to keep their bags within their reach for the whole time, or foldable bicycles that can serve as their own safety lock by wrapping around static poles in the environment.

==International Crime Science Network==
An international Crime Science Network was formed in 2003, with support from the [[EPSRC]]. Since then the term crime science has been variously interpreted, sometimes with a different emphasis from Ross's original description published in 1999, and often favouring [[situational crime]] prevention (redesigning products, services and policies to remove opportunities, temptations and provocations and make detection more certain) rather than other forms of intervention. However a common feature is a focus on delivering immediate reductions in crime.

New crime science departments have been established at Waikato, Cincinnati, Philadelphia and elsewhere.

==Growth of the Crime Science Field==
The concept of crime science appears to be taking root more broadly with: 
*The establishment of crime science departments at the [[University of Waikato]] in New Zealand, [https://www.uc.edu/ics.html Cincinnati] and [http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/crime-science-certificate/ Philadelphia] in the US, and elsewhere.
*Crime Science courses at several institutions including [[Northumbria University]] in the UK and at the [[University of Twente]] in the Netherlands.
*A Crime Science Unit at [[DSTL]], the research division of the UK Ministry of Defence.
*The term crime science increasingly being adopted by situational and experimental criminologists in the US and Australia.
*An annual Crime Science Network gathering in London which draws police and academics from across the world.
*A [[Springer (publisher)|Springer]] [[Open Access]] Interdisciplinary journal devoted to Crime Science [http://www.crimesciencejournal.com].Crime science increasingly being cited in criminology text books and journals papers (sometimes claimed as a new branch of criminology, and sometimes reviled as anti-criminology).
*A move in traditional criminology towards the aims originally set out by Ross in his concern for a more evidence-based, scientific approach to crime reduction.
*Crime science featuring in several learned journals in other disciplines (such as a special issue of the European Journal of Applied Mathematics devoted to "crime modelling") [https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0956792510000070].

==  History ==
Horgan was born on November 15, 1983, in [[Pensacola, Florida]]. He entered the Franciscans as a postulant for Holy Name Province in July 2005 and entered the novitiate the following year after which he professed his first vows in 2007. He professed his solemn bows in the Order of Friars Minor in August 2011 and was ordained to the diaconate in the Roman Catholic Church in September 2011. He was ordained a priest on 19 May 2012 in Silver Spring, MD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gazette.net/article/20120530/NEWS/705309648/1007/a-different-kind-of-brother-franciscan-friars-ordained-as-priests-in&amp;template=gazette {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714173522/http://www.gazette.net/article/20120530/NEWS/705309648/1007/a-different-kind-of-brother-franciscan-friars-ordained-as-priests-in%26template%3Dgazette |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a young age he had already begun to write and publish articles on matters of theology and spirituality.

'''David Abram''' (born June 24, 1957) is an [[American philosopher]], [[Cultural ecology|cultural ecologist]], and [[performance art]]ist, best known for his work bridging the philosophical tradition of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] with environmental and [[Ecology|ecological]] issues.&lt;ref name=Middlebury&gt;{{cite web|title=Fellowships in Environmental Journalism|url=http://www.middlebury.edu/sustainability/fech/fellowships/reporters/node/201491|publisher=Middlebury College}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ions&gt;{{cite web|title=IONS Directory Profile|url=http://noetic.org/directory/person/david-abram/|publisher=Institute of Noetic Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of ''Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/9780375421716.html | title = Becoming Animal by David Abram | accessdate = 2010-11-13 | publisher = Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2010) and ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World'' (1996), for which he received, among other prizes, the international [[Lannan Literary Award]] for Nonfiction. Abram is founder and creative director of the ''Alliance for Wild Ethics (AWE)''; his essays on the cultural causes and consequences of [[Resilience (ecology)|ecological disarray]] have appeared often in such journals as ''[[Orion (magazine)|Orion]], [[Environmental Ethics (journal)|Environmental Ethics]], [[Parabola (magazine)|Parabola]], [[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]],'' and ''[[The Ecologist]],'' as well as numerous anthologies.

In 1996 Abram coined the phrase "the more-than-human world" as a way of referring to earthly nature (introducing it in the subtitle of ''The Spell of the Sensuous'' and throughout the text of that book); the term was gradually adopted by other scholars, theorists, and activists, and has become a key phrase within the lingua franca of the broad ecological movement.

Abram was perhaps the first contemporary philosopher to advocate a reappraisal of "animism" as a complexly nuanced and uniquely viable worldview — one which roots human cognition in the dynamic sentience of the body while affirming the ongoing entanglement of our bodily experience with the uncanny sentience of other animals, each of which encounters the same world that we perceive yet from an outrageously different angle and perspective. A close student of the traditional ecological knowledge systems of diverse indigenous peoples, Abram also articulates the entwinement of human subjectivity with the varied sensitivities of the many plants upon which humans depend, as well as with the agency and dynamism of the particular earthly places — the bioregions or ecosystems — that surround and sustain our communities. In recent years his work has come to be associated with a broad movement loosely termed "New Materialism," due to Abram's espousal of a radically transformed sense of matter and materiality.

In 2014 Abram held the international [[Arne Næss]] Chair of Global Justice and Ecology at the University of Oslo, in Norway.

==Early life==
Born in the suburbs of New York City, Abram began practicing sleight-of-hand magic during his high school years in Baldwin, Long Island; it was this craft that sparked his ongoing fascination with perception. In 1976, he began working as "house magician" at Alice's Restaurant in the Berkshires of Massachusetts and soon was performing at clubs throughout New England while studying at [[Wesleyan University]]. After his second year of college, Abram took a year off to travel as an itinerant street magician through Europe and the Middle East; toward the end of that journey, in London, he began exploring the application of sleight-of-hand magic to psychotherapy under the guidance of [[R. D. Laing]]. After graduating summa cum laude from Wesleyan in 1980, Abram traveled throughout Southeast Asia as an itinerant magician, living and studying with traditional, indigenous magic practitioners (or medicine persons) in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Nepal. Upon returning to North America he continued performing while devoting himself to the study of natural history and ethno-ecology, visiting and learning from native communities in the Southwest desert and the Pacific Northwest. A much-reprinted essay written while studying biology at the [[Yale School of Forestry]] in 1984 — entitled "The Perceptual Implications of Gaia" — brought Abram into association with the scientists formulating the [[Gaia Hypothesis]]; he was soon lecturing in tandem with biologist [[Lynn Margulis]] and geochemist [[James Lovelock]] in Britain and the United States. In the late 1980s, Abram turned his attention to exploring the decisive influence of language upon the human senses and upon our sensory experience of the land around us. Abram received a doctorate for this work from the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]], in 1993.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;{{cite web|title=Animals And Environment Deserve More Respect|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FZJGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gOkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1555,6078806&amp;dq=david-abram+stony-brook&amp;hl=en|publisher=Daily Gazette|date=Jan 28, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Abram's writing is informed by his work with indigenous peoples, as well as by the American nature-writing tradition that stems from [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Walt Whitman]], and [[Mary Austin]]. His philosophical work is informed by the European tradition of phenomenology — in particular, by the work of the French phenomenologist, [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]. Abram's evolving work has also been influenced by his friendships with the archetypal psychologist [[James Hillman]] and with the evolutionary biologist, [[Lynn Margulis]] — as well as by his esteem for the American poet [[Gary Snyder]] and the agrarian novelist, poet, and essayist [[Wendell Berry]].

Writing in the mid-nineteen nineties, finding himself frustrated by the problematic terminology of environmentalism (tired of the conceptual gulf between humankind and the rest of nature tacitly implied by the use of conventional terms like "environment" and even by the word "nature" itself, which is so often contrasted with "culture" as though there were a neat divide between the two), Abram coined the phrase "the more-than-human world" in order to signify the broad commonwealth of earthly life, a realm that manifestly ''includes'' humankind and its culture, but which necessarily ''exceeds'' human culture. The phrase was intended, first and foremost, to indicate that the space of human culture was a subset within a larger set — that the human world was necessarily sustained, surrounded, and permeated by the more-than-human world — yet by the phrase Abram also meant to encourage a new humility on the part of humankind (since the  "more" could be taken not just in a quantitative but also in a qualitative sense). Upon introducing the phrase as a central term in his 1996 book (subtitled ''Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World'') the phrase was gradually adopted by many other theorists and activists, soon becoming an inescapable term within the broad ecological movement.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, its use within various papers in the (current) issue of Environmental Humanities, vol. 4, 2014, or the centrality of the phrase for recent textbooks such as "Ecological Ethics: An Introduction" by Patrick Curry (Polity, 2011) or "Invisible Nature: Healing the Destructive Divide between People and the Environment," by Kenneth Worthy (Prometheus Books, 2013), and innumerable other papers and books.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent writings, Abram sometimes refers to the more-than-human world as the "breathing commonwealth," or the "commonwealth of breath."&lt;ref&gt;See Abram's afterword for ''Material Ecocriticism,'' edited by Serenella Iovino and Serpil Oppermann (Indiana University Press, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of "The Spell of the Sensuous" proved to be catalytic for the formation and consolidation of several new disciplines, especially the burgeoning field of ''[[ecopsychology]]'' (both as a theoretical discipline and as therapeutic practice), as well as [[ecophenomenology]] and ecological linguistics. Already translated into numerous languages, the first French translation of the text was completed by the eminent Belgian philosopher-of-science, Isabelle Stengers, in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Stengers' initial translation was carefully honed by her colleague, the Belgian artist and bioregionalist Didier Demorcey, and was published in France as "Comment la terre s'est tue: Pour une écologie des sens  (La Découverte, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1996, Abram has lectured and taught at universities throughout the world, while nonetheless maintaining his independence from the institutional world of academe. He was named by the ''[[Utne Reader]]'' as one of a hundred visionaries currently transforming the world,&lt;ref&gt;See "100 Visionaries," Utne Reader, Jan/Feb 1995; and "The Loose Canon: 150 Great Works to Set Your Imagination On Fire," Utne Reader, May/June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and profiled in the 2007 book, ''Visionaries: The 20th Century's 100 Most Inspirational Leaders.''&lt;ref&gt;Chelsea Green Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas have often been debated (sometimes heatedly) within the pages of various peer-reviewed academic journals, including [[Environmental Ethics]], [[Environmental Values]], and the [[Journal of Environmental Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Ted Toadvine, "Limits of the Flesh: The Role of Reflection in David Abram's Ecophenomenology" and David Abram, "Between the Body and the Breathing Earth: A Reply to Ted Toadvine" in Environmental Ethics, summer 2005 issue. See also Eleanor D. Helms, "Language and Responsibility" in the Spring 2008 issue of Environmental Philosophy. See also Meg Holden, "Phenomenology versus Pragmatism: Seeking a Restoration Environmental Ethic." Spring 2001 issue, and Abram's reply in the Fall 2001 issue, as well as Steven Vogel, "The Silence of Nature" in Environmental Values 15:2, 2006, and Bryan Bannon, "Flesh and Nature: Understanding Merleau-Ponty's Relational Ontology" in Research in Phenomenology, Volume 41, Issue 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the New England Aquarium and the Orion Society sponsored a large public debate between Abram and distinguished biologist [[E. O. Wilson]], at the old Town Hall in Boston, on science and ethics. (An essay by Abram that grew out of that debate, entitled "Earth in Eclipse," has been published in several versions). In the summer of 2005, Abram delivered a keynote address for the United Nations "World Environment Week" in San Francisco, to 70 mayors from the largest cities around the world.

In 2006, Abram—together with biologist Stephan Harding, ecopsychologist [[Per Espen Stoknes]], and environmental educator Per Ingvar Haukeland—founded the non-profit ''Alliance for Wild Ethics (AWE),'' for which he serves as Creative Director. According to their website, the Alliance is {{Quote|text=a consortium of individuals and organizations working to ease the spreading devastation of the animate earth through a rapid transformation of culture. We employ the arts, often in tandem with the natural sciences, to provoke deeply felt shifts in the human experience of nature. Motivated by a love for the more-than-human collective of life, and for human life as an integral part of that wider collective, we work to revitalize local, face-to-face community – and to integrate our communities perceptually, practically, and imaginatively into the earthly bioregions that surround and support them.}}

In 2010 Abram published ''Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/9780375421716.html | title = Becoming Animal by David Abram | accessdate = 2010-11-13 | publisher = Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the sole runner-up for the inaugural PEN Edward O. Wilson Award for Literary Science Writing, and a finalist for the Orion Book Award. A review in Orion described the book thus: "[A]n intricately textured, deep breath of a book that blurs the boundaries between human and animal, mind and earth..." A review by Potawatomi elder Robin Wall Kimmerer (author of ''Braiding Sweetgrass)'' claimed: {{Quote|text=With prose as lush as a moss-draped rain forest and as luminous as a high desert night, David Abram reminds us of what we already know, but have allowed the artifices of technology and over-reliance on abstract intelligence to dull: We are each of us gifted with animal senses that languish without exercise, and that can excite and nourish our spiritual and sensual engagement with the world. Deeply resonant with indigenous ways of knowing, ''Becoming Animal'' reminds us of the porosity of the boundary between ourselves and the more-than-human world. Abram lets us listen in on wordless conversations with ancient boulders, walruses, birds, and roof beams. His profound recognition of intelligences other than our own enables us to enter into reciprocal symbioses that can in turn, sustain the world.}} In the UK, a review in the journal [[Resurgence &amp; Ecologist|Resurgence]] said: "Without doubt one of America's greatest nature writers, one who ably follows in the footsteps of Muir, Thoreau and Leopold...The language is luminous, the style hypnotic. Abram weaves a spell that brings the world alive."  In 2014 Abram held the international [[Arne Næss]] Chair of Global Justice and Ecology at the University of Oslo, in Norway. In that same year he became a distinguished Fellow of Schumacher College, where he teaches regularly. He also teaches a weeklong intensive each summer on Cortes Island, in British Columbia. The father of two teenage children, Abram lives with his family in the foothills of the southern Rockies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14174">In [[ancient Greek philosophy]], especially that of [[Aristotle]], the '''golden''' '''mean''' or '''golden middle way''' is the desirable middle between two extremes, one of excess and the other of deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Nicomachean Ethics (Aristotle)|''Nicomachean Ethics'']]'' II.1 &lt;/ref&gt;
 
For example, in the Aristotelian view, [[courage]] is a [[virtue]], but if taken to excess would manifest as [[Recklessness (psychology)|recklessness]], and, in deficiency, [[cowardice]].

To the Greek mentality, it was an attribute of beauty.  Both ancients and moderns believed that there is a close association in mathematics between [[beauty]] and [[truth]]. The Greeks believed there to be three "ingredients" to beauty: [[symmetry]], [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]], and [[harmony]]. Beauty was an object of love and something that was to be imitated and reproduced in their lives, architecture, education (''[[paideia]]''), and politics.  They judged life by this mentality.

==History==

===Western philosophy===

====Crete====
The earliest representation of this idea in culture is probably in the mythological [[Crete|Cretan]] tale of [[Daedalus]] and [[Icarus (mythology)|Icarus]]. Daedalus, a famous artist of his time, built feathered wings for himself and his son so that they might escape the clutches of  [[Minos|King Minos]]. Daedalus warns his beloved son whom he loved so much to "''fly the middle course''", between the sea spray and the sun's heat. Icarus did not heed his father; he flew up and up until the sun melted the wax off his wings. For not heeding the middle course, he fell into the sea and drowned.

====Delphi====
Another early elaboration is the [[Doric Greek|Doric]] saying carved on the front of the temple at [[Delphi]]: "''Nothing in Excess''" ("[[Meden Agan]]").

====Pythagoreans====

The first work on the golden mean is sometimes attributed to [[Theano (mathematician)|Theano]], wife of [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Women in Mathematics | author = Lynn M. Osen | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | date = 1975 | isbn = 978-0-262-65009-0 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=81kQ9VtTal4C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=Theano+golden-mean }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cleobulus====
To [[Cleobulus]] is attributed the maxim: ''Mέτρον ἄριστον''  "Moderation is best" [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D6]

====Socrates====
[[Socrates]] teaches that a man must know "how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side, as far as possible."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]'' 10.619a&lt;/ref&gt;

In education, Socrates asks us to consider the effect of either an exclusive devotion to gymnastics or an exclusive devotion to music. It either "produced a temper of hardness and ferocity, (or) the other of softness and [[Classical definition of effeminacy|effeminacy]]."{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}  Having both qualities, he believed, produces harmony; i.e., beauty and goodness.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} He additionally stresses the importance of mathematics in education for the understanding of beauty and truth.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

====Plato====
Proportion's relation to beauty and goodness is stressed throughout [[Plato]]'s dialogues, particularly in the [[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] and ''[[Philebus]]''. He writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;
SOCRATES: That any kind of mixture that does not in some way or other possess measure of the nature of proportion will necessarily corrupt its ingredients and most of all itself. For there would be no blending in such a case at all but really an unconnected medley, the ruin of whatever happens to be contained in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
PROTARCHUS: Very true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
SOCRATES: But now we notice that the force of the good has taken up refuge in an alliance with the nature of the beautiful. For measure and proportion manifest themselves in all areas of beauty and virtue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
PROTARCHUS: Undeniably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
SOCRATES: But we said that truth is also inclined along with them in our mixture?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
PROTARCHUS: Indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
SOCRATES: Well, then, if we cannot capture the good in ''one'' form, we will have to take hold of it in a conjunction of three: beauty, proportion and truth. Let us affirm that these should by right be treated as a unity and be held responsible for what is in the mixture, for goodness is what makes the mixture good in itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(''Phlb.'' 64d–65a) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', Plato applies this principle to electing a government in the ideal state: "Conducted in this way, the election will strike a mean between monarchy and democracy …"

====Aristotle====
In the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] writes on the virtues. Aristotle’s theory on virtue ethics is one that does not see a person’s actions as a reflection of their ethics but rather looks into the character of a person as the reason behind their ethics. His constant phrase is,  "… is the Middle state between …".  His psychology of the soul and its virtues is based on the golden mean between the extremes. In the ''Politics'', Aristotle criticizes the Spartan Polity by critiquing the disproportionate elements of the constitution; e.g., they trained the men and not the women, and they trained for war but not peace. This disharmony produced difficulties which he elaborates on in his work. See also the [[Nicomachean Ethics#Book II: That virtues of character can be described as means|discussion in the Nicomachean Ethics]] of the golden mean, and [[Aristotelian ethics]] in general.

===Eastern philosophy===
[[Gautama Buddha]] (fl. 6th century BC) taught of the [[Middle Way]], a path between the extremes of religious asceticism and worldly self-indulgence.

[[Confucius]] in ''[[The Analects]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Analects | author = Confucius | publisher = Filiquarian Publishing, LLC. | date = 2006 | isbn = 978-1-59986-974-2 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=DicvjslBOwAC&amp;dq=Confucius+Analects&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; written through the [[Warring States period]] of [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]] (c. 479 BC – 221 BC), taught excess is similar to deficiency. A way of living in the mean is the [[Doctrine of the Mean|way of Zhongyong]].

[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]] was the [[Tao]]'s most famous commentator (369–286 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Tao: The Watercourse Way | author = [[Alan Watts|Watts, Alan]] with [[Chungliang Al Huang|Huan, Al Chungliang]] | publisher = [[Pantheon Books]] | date = 1975 | isbn = 0-394-73311-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tiruvalluvar]] (2nd century BC and the 8th century AD; date disputed) in his [[Tirukkural]] of the [[Sangam period]] of [[Tamizhagam]] writes of the [[middle state]] which is to preserve equity. He emphasises this principle and suggests that the two ways of preserving equity is to be impartial and avoid excess. [[Parimelazhagar]] was the historical commentator of the [[Tirukkural]].

===Judaism===
{{main article|Golden mean (Judaism)}}
[[Rambam]] in [[Mishneh Torah]] attributes this method to the first scholars ([[Chazal]]), and to [[Abraham]]. Indeed, a similar concept exists even in the [[Rabbinic literature]], [[Tosefta]] and the [[Jerusalem Talmud|Yerushalmi]]. [[Isaac ben Moses Arama|Yitzhak Arama]] finds references even in the [[Tanakh|Bible]].

One such instance is [[Eccl. 7:16-17]], where the preacher admonishes his audience to "be not righteous over much" and to "be not over much wicked." [[Adam Clarke]] takes the phrase "righteous over much" to mean indulging in too much "austerity and hard study," &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.studylight.org/ | title = Adam Clarke's Commentary on the Bible | last = Clarke | first = Adam | date = n.d.| publisher = J. Emory and B Waugh | access-date = May 30, 2018 | quote = “austerity and hard study”}} &lt;/ref&gt; and concludes that “there is no need of all this watching, fasting, praying, self-denial, etc., you carry things to extremes. Why should you wish to be reputed singular and precise?” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.studylight.org/ | title = Adam Clarke's Commentary on the Bible | last = Clarke | first = Adam | date = n.d.| publisher = J. Emory and B Waugh | access-date = May 30, 2018 | quote = “There is no need of all this watching, fasting, praying, self-denial, etc., you carry things to extremes. Why should you wish to be reputed singular and precise?”}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the ideal of the golden mean may have existed as long as six hundred years before Aristotle. However, some scholars, such as Albert Barnes, hold a slightly different interpretation of Ecclesiastes 7:16-17 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.studylight.org/ | title = Albert Barnes' Notes on the Whole Bible | last = Barnes| first = Albert| date = n.d.| publisher = Estes and Lauriate; John Murray; Blackie &amp; Son; Funk &amp; Wagnalls | access-date = May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Ahead of the times [[Rambam]], 1133-1204 AD (probably due to [[Plato]]'s and [[Aristotle]]’s engagement with [[Ethics]]), determined that a person has to take care of his soul as well as his body, and just as a person who is sick in his body turns to the doctor, a person who has mental illness needs to go to the doctor of the soul, which is, according to him, the philosopher or the sage. [[Rambam]] opposed the [[Determinism|deterministic]] approach, arguing that a person has [[free will]] and the ability to change its properties.

===Christianity===
[[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas, OP]], the medieval [[Catholic]] [[philosopher]] and [[theologian]], in his [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2064.htm ''Summa Theologiae'', Prima Secundæ Partis, Question 64], argued that Christian morality is consistent with the mean: "evil consists in discordance from their rule or measure. Now this may happen either by their exceeding the measure or by their falling short of it[.] ... Therefore it is evident that moral virtue observes the mean."

===Islam===
Islam promotes the golden mean in many instances.  The Quran states an example in finance, in that a person should not spend all he makes as not to be caught needing, and not to be stingy as to not live a comfortable life. Muhammad also had a saying "خير الأمور أوسطها" meaning the best choice is the middle ground/golden mean one. In Quran (Chapter 'The Cow', verse number 143) it is said that, "We have made you a balanced, moderate nation".

Quran quotes the example of two groups of people, calling one of them extremely greedy (Chasing the wealth of the world) in Chapter 'The Cow' verse 96 and to the others as inventors of monasticism (over-zealousness in religion) in Chapter Al-Hadeed verse number 27. Islam councils its followers to abstain from both these paths of extremities and adopt moderation in chasing the world and practicing religion alike.

Not the least the Quran emphasises that the Muslim community ( Umma) is a ’middle nation’ / a 'just community' / an Umma justly balanced / a moderate nation / a midmost nation (ummatan wasaTan)  in verse 2-143: a middle between extremism and sloppiness.

===Modernity===
[[Jacques Maritain]], throughout his ''Introduction to Philosophy'' (1930),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Introduction to Philosophy | author = Jacques Maritain | publisher = Continuum | date = 2005 | origyear = 1st ed. 1930 | isbn = 0-8264-7717-8 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=PzUnH4Z0APsC&amp;dq=Jacques+Maritain+Introduction+to+Philosophy&amp;printsec=frontcover# }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the idea of the golden mean to place Aristotelian-Thomist philosophy between the deficiencies and extremes of other philosophers and systems.

==Quotations==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
*"In many things the middle have the best / Be mine a middle station."&lt;br&gt; &amp;mdash; [[Phocylides]]
*"When [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] tried to define beauty, he returned always to one deep thought; beauty, he said, is unity in variety!  Science is nothing else than the search to discover unity in the wild variety of nature,&amp;mdash;or, more exactly, in the variety of our experience.  Poetry, painting, the arts are the same search, in Coleridge’s phrase, for unity in variety."&lt;br&gt; &amp;mdash; [[Jacob Bronowski]]
*"…but for harmony beautiful to contemplate, science would not be worth following."&lt;br&gt; &amp;mdash; [[Henri Poincaré]].
*"If a man finds that his nature tends or is disposed to one of these extremes..., he should turn back and improve, so as to walk in the way of good people, which is the right way.  The right way is the mean in each group of dispositions common to humanity; namely, that disposition which is equally distant from the two extremes in its class, not being nearer to the one than to the other." &lt;br&gt; &amp;mdash; [[Maimonides]]
*"What is wanted is a balance between extravagance and miserliness through moderation, with the goal of distance between both extremes." &lt;br&gt; &amp;mdash; [[al-Ghazali]]

'''Gordon H. Bower''' (born December 30, 1932) is a [[cognitive psychologist]] studying [[human memory]], [[language comprehension]], emotion, and behavior modification. He received his Ph.D. in [[learning theory (education)|learning theory]] from [[Yale University]] in 1959. He currently holds the A. R. Lang Emeritus Professorship at [[Stanford University]]. In addition to his research, Bower also was a notable adviser to numerous students, including [[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John R. Anderson]], [[Lawrence W. Barsalou]], [[Lera Boroditsky]], [[Keith Holyoak]], [[Stephen Kosslyn]], [[Alan Lesgold]], and [[Robert Sternberg]], among others.

He was voted number 42 in the list of most notable psychologists of the 20th century, published by  the''Review of General Psychology''.&lt;ref&gt;Haggbloom, S.J. et al, 2002, The 100 Most Eminent Psychologists of the 20th Century, Review of General Psychology, Vol. 6, No. 2, 139–152.&lt;/ref&gt; 
He was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]] in 2005.

==General Information==
Gordon H. Bower is a cognitive social psychologist currently. His main areas of study include human memory, mnemonic devices, retrieval strategies, recording strategies, and [[category learning]]. He is interested in [[cognitive processes]], [[emotion]], imagery, language and [[reading comprehension]] as they relate to memory.&lt;ref&gt;Bower, Gordon H (2010). In Stanford University Department of Psychology. Retrieved April 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He is married to Sharon, the founder of a communication consulting firm who has published three self-help books on speech anxiety. Together, they have three children.&lt;ref name="Bower 2007"&gt;Bower, G. H. (2007). Gordon H. Bower. In G. Lindzey, W. M. Runyan, G. Lindzey, W. M.

==Early life==
Bower was born on December 30, 1932, in [[Scio, Ohio]], to Clyde Ward and Mabel (Bosart).&lt;ref name = Marquis&gt;{{cite web | title = Profile details: Gordon Howard Bower | url = http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100003810087 | accessdate = August 7, 2012 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father worked as a grocery store owner and his mother was a teacher. During high school, he was encouraged by his teachers to pursue a career in psychiatry. Out of high school, he accepted a four-year scholarship to play baseball at Cleveland's Western Reserve University and during his freshman year, began working in the Cleveland State Mental Hospital. In order to avoid the military draft, Bower opted for graduate school, but his experiences in the mental hospital dissuaded him from a career as a psychiatrist.&lt;ref name = Autobiography&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Evolution of a Cognitive Psychologist: A Journey from Simple Behaviors to Complex Mental Acts | url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093722 | journal=Annual Review of Psychology | publisher = Annual Reviews |year=2008 |volume=59 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093722 | pages=1–27 | pmid=18154497 | last1 = Bower | first1 = GH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Bower was attending Yale for his degree in Experimental Psychology, he discovered a passion for learning theory and presented his findings on dual reward-punishment in rats to the American Psychological Association. During this time, he and Bill Estes also revised Edward Tolman's vicarious trial and error model to include human choices among commodity options.&lt;ref name="Bower 2007"/&gt; Bower married Sharon Anthony on January 30, 1957.&lt;ref name = Marquis /&gt;

==Career==
In 1959, Bower was hired at the [[Stanford]] Psychology Department. Until the late 1960s, he continued the animal research he had begun as a graduate student, but when Bill Estes and Dick Atkinson joined the faculty, his focus shifted to mathematical models of memory. One model they produced explained "hypothesis testing  behavior  of subjects  learning  very  simple classifications  (concepts)  in  the  standard  trial-by-trial procedures  that  overtaxed  memory."
After wearying of studying models of memory, Bower shifted his focus to study short-term memory. He worked on a team that created both the time-decay queuing model and the fixed-space displacement model to describe how items in short term memory might be lost before they could be encoded in long-term memory. This spawned into research into how organizational devices could expand the capacity of short term memory past the traditional 7 items. A particular mnemonic device that Bower researched that is still popular today is [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]], in which a person groups objects together to improve memory.&lt;ref name="Bower 2007"/&gt;
His works during this time also included the huge benefits of mnemonic aids and how these aids are often converted into visual images, human associative memory and propositional learning, state dependent memory, connectionist modeling for categorical learning, and how we remember narratives.&lt;ref name="Bower 2007"/&gt; In 1979 he was honored with the Award for Distinguished Scientific Contribution by the American Psychological Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = | title = Awards for Distinguished Scientific Contributions: Gordon H.

'''Hagwon''' ({{IPA-ko|hagwʌn}}) is the Korean-language word for a for-profit private institute, academy or [[cram school]] prevalent in [[South Korea]]. Although most widely known for their role as "cram schools", where children can study to improve scores, hagwon actually perform several educational functions: they provide supplementary education that many children need just to keep up with the regular school curriculum, remedial education for the children who fall behind in their work, training in areas not covered in schools, and preparation for students striving to improve test scores and preparing for the high school and university [[entrance examination]]s (the university entrance exam is also called [[suneung]] (수능)). Many other children, particularly younger children, attend nonacademic hagwon for piano lessons, art instruction, swimming, and [[taekwondo]] (태권도). Most young children attend a hagwon.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170109000747&lt;/ref&gt; Hagwon also play a social role; occasionally children ask to be sent because their friends attend. There also exist hagwon for adults, such as flower arrangement and driving instruction hagwon. The term is also sometimes used to describe similar institutions operated by [[Korean Americans]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/28/nyregion/cram-schools-immigrants-tools-for-success.html|title=Cram Schools: Immigrants' Tools for Success|accessdate=28 August 2009|date=28 January 1995|author=Ashley Dunn|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/17/local/me-classroom17|title=Using Summer to Spring Ahead for the Fall|accessdate=29 August 2009|date=17 July 2002|author=Daniel Yi|publisher=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children of all ages often attend hagwon, even those in the [[pre-school]] age bracket. It is not uncommon for students to be enrolled in several hagwon of different subject areas at once in addition to their normal school attendance. Hagwon often specialize in subjects like mathematics, foreign languages, science, arts, or music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-3899195_ITM|title=South Koreans' Zeal for English Leads to Abuse of 'Hagwon' System.|accessdate=29 August 2009|date=4 March 2005|publisher=Yonhap News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many hagwon also have adults as students, particularly those dedicated to teaching the English language.

While some see hagwon as filling a need not being adequately met by the public school system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.rnw.nl/migratie/www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/region/asiapacific/korea010608.html-redirected|title=Education-Obsessed South Korea|author=Hyun-Sung Khang|accessdate=29 August 2009|date=8 June 2001|publisher=Radio Netherlands Worldwide}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; others see them as creating an unequal footing between the poor and rich in Korea.&lt;ref name="gangnamfever"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2009/03/165_37117.html|title=(509) Gangnam Fever|accessdate=29 August 2009|date=1 January 2009|author=Andrei Lankov|publisher=Korea Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2009/04/162_17816.html|title=Are They Criminals?|publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=30 August 2009|date=23 January 2008|author=Kim See-bong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, it was reported that there were over 70,000 hagwon in South Korea with 47 percent of them focused on high school enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2913964|title=Statistics paint Korean picture|publisher=Joongang Daily|date=15 December 2009|accessdate=10 February 2010|author=Moon Gwang-lip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and regulations==
In 1885, [[Henry Appenzeller]] founded the Paichai school (배재대학교) as a cover for his missionary work. At the time it was illegal to preach other religions in Korea. Although his main goal was to spread his faith, it was still used by Koreans to learn English.&lt;ref name="origengboom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2007/10/165_11302.html|title=(470) Original English Boom|publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=1 September 2009|date=4 October 2009|author=Andrei Lankov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private education, known as ''gwaoe'' (과외), was banned by President [[Chun Doo-hwan]] (전두환) in 1980. It was felt the advantage of private education unfairly burdened the poor and to promote equality, all access to it was made illegal. Through the years the government has relaxed the restrictions on private education by increasingly allowing more individuals and organizations to offer private education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4679|title=You'll Never Guess What South Korea Frowns Upon|author=Casey Lartigue|date=28 May 2000|accessdate=28 August 2009|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the ban was ruled unconstitutional in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/GK30Dg01.html|title=Life and death exams in South Korea|accessdate=29 August 2009|date=30 November 2005|publisher=Asia Times|author=James Card}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korean courts have ruled that it may violate the constitution for the government to limit the amount of money hagwon can charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2009/08/123_50060.html|title=Cost of Daily Necessities Soaring|accessdate=28 August 2009|date=13 August 2009|publisher=Korea Times|author=Yoon Ja-young}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2008, the [[Seoul]] government was working on changes to the regulations to allow hagwons to set their own hours, citing individual choice as trumping regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=20687&amp;categoryCode=117|title=Should Hagwon Run Round-the-Clock?|publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=30 August 2009|date=13 March 2008|author=Bae Ji-sook}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government reversed its position five days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/10/117_20937.html|title=Seoul City Council Cancels All-Night Hagwon Plan|publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=30 August 2009|date=18 March 2008|author=Kim Tae-jong}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations were criticized as ineffective because the city council possessed limited resources to monitor and enforce them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/include/print.asp?newsIdx=33321|title=Hagwon Easily Dodge Crackdown|publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=30 August 2009|date=26 October 2008|author=Kim Tae-jong}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with these restrictions, hagwon also had to disclose their tuition amounts to the government so people could complain if the schools attempted to raise the tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/10/117_33465.html|title=Hagwon Face Sterner Supervision|publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=30 August 2009|date=28 October 2008|author=Kang Shin-who}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licenses of hagwon caught running false advertisements will be revoked. Hagwon are required to issue cash receipts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/10/113_32922.html|title=Rules Toughtened for Hagwon Operation|publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=30 August 2009|date=19 October 2008|author=Kang Shin-who}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, to help catch violators of these new regulations, the government started a program to reward people who reported them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/NEWKHSITE/data/html_dir/2009/08/14/200908140039.asp|title=Lee seeks to cut educational costs|accessdate=28 August 2009|date=14 August 2009|author=sshluck|publisher=KoreaHerald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations were intended to reduce the cost of private education. However, some hagwon added weekend classes to compensate for shorter weekday classes. Other parents have sought out private tutors to make up for lost study time.&lt;ref name="goeson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2908856|title=Hagwon close, but late-night education goes on|accessdate=28 August 2009|date=17 August 2009|publisher=Joongang Daily|author=Lee Soo-yeon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hagwon simply ignored the regulations. It was reported in April 2009 that 67&amp;nbsp;percent of hagwon sampled were found to have overcharged for tuition. Forty percent were found to have charged parents over two times the registered tuition amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/04/117_43184.html|title=67 Percent of Private Cram Schools Overcharge Parents|publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=30 August 2009|date=14 April 2009|author=Kang Shin-who}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, the government prohibited school teachers from creating test questions for hagwons. It had been found that some teachers were leaking tests and test questions to hagwons, giving the students who attended those schools advantages when it came time to take the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=21176&amp;categoryCode=117|title=Teachers Banned From Making Test Questions for Hagwon|accessdate=29 August 2009|date=23 March 2008|publisher=Korea Times|author=Kang Shin-who}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A petition was made in October 2009 by parents, teachers, students and hagwon owners to challenge the government's legislation regarding hagwon closing times in Seoul and Busan. The constitutional court ruled that the laws did not violate the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2911944|title=Despite protests, court says hagwon ban is constitutional|authors=Park Yu-mi, Kim Mi-ju|publisher=Joongang Daily|accessdate=6 November 2009|date=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restriction was put in place for Seoul and Busan in the summer of 2009.&lt;ref name="goeson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/07/113_48122.html|publisher=Korea Times|title='Hagwon' Curfew to Be Set at 10&amp;nbsp;pm|accessdate=6 November 2009|author=kswho|date=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In making the ruling the court said, "Because it’s important to secure sleep for high school students to overcome fatigue and for the sake of their growth, it’s difficult to say that [the ban] excessively restricts basic rights."

In April 2010 it was reported that there were over 25,000 hagwon registered with the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, with nearly 6,000 being in the Gangnam area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2918954|title=Gangnam scores for most hagwon, closures|author=Park Su-ryon|publisher=Joongang Daily|date=9 April 2010|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also revealed that local government councils other than Seoul had decided not to implement the 22:00 curfew. The curfew was seen as not having an impact on education fees and not addressing the real concern with private education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/04/113_63489.html|publisher=Korea Times|title='Hagwon' Curfew Backsliding|date=1 April 2010|author=Kang Shin-who|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the curfew, there have been attempts to get around this curfew among hagwon in Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Hye-yeong (혜영) |last=Kim (김) |script-title=ko:학원, 대놓고 수업하는 곳은 없지만 10시 넘자 셔터 내리고 '보충' |date=11 March 2011 |url=http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/society/201103/h2011031102322921950.htm |work=Hankook Ilbo |accessdate=2011-03-30 |language=Korean |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319200946/http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/society/201103/h2011031102322921950.htm |archivedate=19 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on real estate ==
A higher than average concentration of hagwon in the [[Gangnam-gu]] (강남구) area, specifically [[Daechi-dong]] (대치동), has been cited as the primary reason for an increase in real estate costs in the area. In the 1970s the Seoul government made some top schools relocate to the area; however, the schools there have become associated with entry into elite high schools and then elite universities. Many residents feel their children need to be associated with these schools in order to reach the upper levels of business and success. As more parents try to move to the area to allow their children to attend these schools, the prices of real estate in the area have risen to 300&amp;nbsp;percent of similar areas in Seoul.&lt;ref name="gangnamfever" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=1993657|title=An address some people will die for|publisher=Joongang Daily|accessdate=29 August 2009|date=12 June 2003|author=Lee Sang-geon, Kim Myeong-ryong}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the government had planned to develop a hagwon center in [[Pangyo, Seongnam|Pangyo]] to relieve some of the pressure on Gangnam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-24404792_ITM|title=Plan for satellite 'hagwon' town under fire|publisher=Korea Herald|accessdate=29 August 2009|date=15 September 2003|author=Choe Yong-shik}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet after heavy criticism for only shifting the problem around and not solving it, the government canceled the plan only a couple weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-792322_ITM|title=Gov't Scraps Plan to Build Private Institute Zone in Pangyo|accessdate=29 August 2009|date=27 September 2003|publisher=Yonhap News|author=entropy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English-language instructors==
{{See also|Teaching English as a foreign language}}
Native English speakers were hired as early as 1883 in Korea, originally out of need. The first teacher hired at the government-run Tongmunhak was Thomas Hallifax.&lt;ref name="origengboom" /&gt; Due to the preference for having native English speakers teach English, many native English-speakers are still hired to teach at hagwons in Korea. These hagwons may be only English schools or they could also be schools which have a variety of subjects including English. The minimum requirements for foreigners for such teaching positions are: citizenship of [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], the [[United Kingdom]], or the [[United States]], a clean [[criminal background check]] at the national level, and a bachelor's degree obtained in one of the aforementioned countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hikorea.go.kr/pt/InfoDetailR_en.pt?categoryId=2&amp;parentId=382&amp;catSeq=385&amp;showMenuId=374&amp;visaId=E2|title=Foreign Language teaching (E-2)|accessdate=31 August 2009|publisher=Government of Korea}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/01/116_17625.html|title=Envoys Criticize Teaching-Visa Rule|date=20 January 2008|accessdate=25 June 2011|publisher=Koreatimes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121062724/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/01/116_17625.html|author=Yoon Won-sup|author2=Kang Shin-who|archivedate=21 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return for signing a one-year contract, the institute provides an instructor with a monthly salary, round-trip airfare from his or her country of origin,  usually a rent-free apartment or housing stipend for the duration of the instructor's contract, and an additional one-month "severance pay" at the completion of the contract.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_cerralbo/20050530.html|title=The good, the bad and the hagwon|accessdate=31 August 2009|date=30 May 2005|author=YOAV CERRALBO|publisher=CBC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826133815/http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_cerralbo/20050530.html|archivedate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Foreigners in Korea|Foreign]] instructors hold a mixed view of hagwons. Many instructors have had no significant issues with the hagwon they've worked at.&lt;ref name="cbc" /&gt;

Hagwon owners have complained about the challenge in finding truly qualified teachers.&lt;ref name="cbc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2898300|title=English teachers complain about certain hagwon|publisher=Joongang Daily|accessdate=31 August 2009|date=8 December 2008|author=Limb Jae-un}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of English instructors first formed a [[labour union]] at a hagwon in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/include/print.asp?newsIdx=56894|title=English Teachers Establish Labor Union in Incheon|publisher=[[Korea Times]]|date=8 December 2009|accessdate=10 February 2010|author=Park Si-soo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hagwon abroad==
In some English-speaking countries, hagwon exist for ethnic Koreans. In North America, about 75% of Korean-language supplemental schools have affiliation with churches.&lt;ref name=Hirvelap103&gt;Hirvela, Alan. "Diverse Literacy Practices among Asian Populations: Implications for Theory and Pedagogy" (Chapter 5). In: Farr, Marcia, Lisya Seloni, and Juyoung Song (editors). ''Ethnolinguistic Diversity and Education: Language, Literacy and Culture''. [[Routledge]], January 25, 2011. Start page 99. {{ISBN|1135183708}}, 9781135183707. - Cited: p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=bHWMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103 103]. "These, too, exist as a result of efforts made by local ethnic communities. Chinese (buxiban) and Korean (hagwon) schools are the most dominant of these learning environments, while Japanese heritage schools (hoshuko) also exist in certain communities." and "[...]while the large majority (around 75 percent) of Korean schools are affiliated with churches; these began to appear in the early 1970s (Zhou &amp; Kim, 2006)."&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, of the hagwon registered with the [[Korean School Association of America]] (KSAA), over 75% were affiliated with Korean churches. There are also secular formal hagwon and secular informal hagwon.&lt;ref name=ZhouMinp12&gt;Zhou and Kim, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The ''hagwon'' are equivalent to ''[[hoshū jugyō kō]]'' (''hoshūkō'') in ethnic Japanese communities and ''[[buxiban]]'' in ethnic Chinese communities.&lt;ref name=Hirvelap103/&gt; As of 2010, every year over 50,000 Korean Americans attend Korean heritage schools.&lt;ref name=KHRp1&gt;Kang, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Korean schools were first established in Hawaii after 1903, when the first wave of Korean immigration came to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern generation of Korean supplemental schools were first established in the United States in the 1970s. At the time they were weekend schools that had a mission to preserve the Korean-American identity in its students. They taught the Korean language, managed the assimilation of Korean-American children, and offered afterschool tutoring programs. There were almost 500 schools registered with the KSAA by the end of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=ZhouMinp12/&gt; Beginning in the 1990s there were also ''hagwon'' that were supplementary academic preparation programs like the ones in Korea.&lt;ref name=ZhouMinp13&gt;Zhou and Kim, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Kang Hee-Ryong, author of the [[PhD thesis]] ''White supremacy, racialization, and cultural politics of Korean Heritage Language Schools'', wrote that the Korean heritage schools are "not simply a means of counter hegemony against the racializing forces" but instead the "product of compromises" between different generations of Korean Americans.&lt;ref name=KHRp1/&gt;

'''Hans Lipps''' (22 November 1889 – 10 September 1941) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[existentialism|existentialist]] [[philosopher]].

==Biographical sketch==

Following his highschool graduation in [[Dresden]] in 1909, Lipps began studying [[art history]], [[architecture]], [[aesthetics]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]. In 1910–1911 while doing his military service in Dresden he continued his philosophical studies at [[Dresden University of Technology|Dresden's University of Technology]]. In the spring of 1911 he moved to [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] to study with [[Edmund Husserl]]. Together with Theodor Conrad and his wife, [[Hedwig Conrad-Martius]], as well as [[Roman Ingarden]] and Fritz Kaufmann, Lipps belonged to the famous "Philosophical Society of Göttingen" that gathered around Husserl and [[Adolf Reinach]]. This society also included [[Edith Stein]], who described the young Lipps as follows: "''He was very tall, slender but strong; his handsome, expressive face was fresh like a child's and his big round eyes were earnest – questioning like a child's eyes. He usually uttered his opinion in a short but definitive statement.''"&lt;ref&gt;Edith Stein, ''Werke'' VII: ''Aus dem Leben einer jüdischen Familie'', ed. by L. Gelber and Romaeus Leuven (Louvain: Nauwelaerts, 1965), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lipps also studied [[biology]]. In the winter of 1912 he completed a doctorate with a dissertation entitled "''About structural changes of plants in a modified medium''", after which he began to study [[medicine]]. Between 1914 and 1918 he served in [[World War I]] as an assistant army physician. After the war he continued his interrupted studies in Göttingen and [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg i. Br.]] and completed his formal medical degree. In 1919 he received his license to practice medicine, and in 1920 he published a Ph.D. dissertation in medicine addressing "''... the effect of certain colchicine derivatives''".

In 1921 he completed his habilitation (qualification for professorship) under the mathematician [[Richard Courant]], whom he had met through Edith Stein, with a dissertation entitled "''Investigations into the philosophy of mathematics''". Lipps had close personal links with the philosophers Josef König, [[Helmuth Plessner]], and [[Georg Misch]]. During the academic year 1923/24 he and Misch conducted a seminar on the theory of signification ([[hermeneutics]]). In 1928 Lipps substituted for the professor of philosophy at the [[University of Marburg]]. Having declined a professorship at the [[University of Santiago de Chile]], he accepted in 1936 the position of Ordinarius (chair professor) of philosophy at the [[University of Frankfurt am Main]].

Throughout his academic career, Lipps continued occasionally to practice medicine, substituting alternatively for army physicians and country doctors. During the term breaks 1921/1922 and again 1930/1931, when he was already teaching as a professor, he served for extensive periods as a doctor in the navy, traveling to all continents except for Australia. In 1934 Hans Lipps joined the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian Tilitzki: Die deutsche Universitätsphilosophie in der Weimarer Republik und im Dritten Reich, Teil 1. Akademie Verlag, Berlin 2002 {{ISBN|978-3-050-03647-2}}, p. 636&lt;/ref&gt; According to Otto Friedrich Bollnow, Lipps did so to put a distance between himself and the NSDAP, submitting that SS was a purely military organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Waltraud Herbstrith, ''Edith Steins Unterstützer: Bekannte und unbekannte Helfer während der NS-Diktatur'', Lit Verlag, Münster, 2010, p. 83, {{ISBN|978-3643107398}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of [[World War II]] in September 1939 he was drafted to the military and served as an army doctor in [[France]] and [[Russia]]. He lost his life in a battle at Shabero/Ochwat on 10 September 1941 and was buried in the nearby cemetery of Dudino.&lt;ref&gt;See: Eberhard Avé-Lallemant, "Daten zu Leben und Werk von Hans Lipps," in: ''Dilthey-Jahrbuch für Philosophie und Geschichte der Geisteswissenschaften'' 6 (1989), pp. 13-21 [15].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy as responsible self-acceptance==

According to Lipps, human existence is grounded in the interpretation of reality. Asking about what something is refers to and fundamentally involves the human being, in relation to whom everything primarily is.

Husserl, too, demands a reversion. Yet his return is not directed towards the concrete human being but instead to a "transcendental ego" through which the concrete human being is to be constituted in the first place. [[Martin Heidegger]] substituted Husserl's intentional analysis of "transcendental consciousness" with the existential analytic of Dasein, as it has been expounded in [[Sein und Zeit]] in terms of a fundamental ontology.

Like Heidegger, Lipps inquires about the Sein of the concrete human being. While Heidegger interprets this Sein as a phenomenon in the sense of something "which-shows-itself," Lipps begins from the question: "''Inwiefern wird in der mannigfachen Bedeutung des Seienden gerade die Verfassung meiner Existenz Erfahrung?''" (''To what extent does the manifold signification of Seiendes lead to the experience of the constitution of my existence?'')&lt;ref&gt;Die menschliche Natur, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; With this question, Lipps moves closer to Husserl's method of transcendental inquiry ("transzendentale Leitfäden"). Unlike Husserl, however, Lipps is neither concerned with the constitution of Seiendes, nor – as Heidegger is – with the question about the "''Sein des Seienden''". From Lipps's point of view, ''Sein'' cannot be disentangled from the concretization of its essence ("''was''"). His focus is on the manifold meanings of being ("''sein''"): the "''is''" in statements such as "''is blue''", "''is a lion''", "''is iron''", "''is rain''", "''is a speech''", "''is greed''", etc. denotes different things and differs in its respective meaning. From this Lipps concludes: "Es gibt keine ''universelle'' Ontologie." (There is no universal ontology.)&lt;ref&gt;''Untersuchungen zur Phänomenologie der Erkenntnis'', part II, ''Aussage und Urteil'' p. 13. Since Lipps writes this shortly after reading Sein und Zeit, as he mentions in the preface of volume II, one must assume that he is deliberately commenting on Heidegger.&lt;/ref&gt;

So what exactly is the subject matter of Hans Lipps's philosophy? Does his thought move on a trajectory from the essence of things ("''das Was der Dinge''") via "''language''" ("''Sprache''") to the "''human being''" ("''Mensch''"), as his three major treatises might suggest? Lipps states: "''Die Weise, in der der Philosophierende existiert, sich vor sich selbst bringt in der Bewegtheit seiner Einstellung - aber kein Gegenstand - bestimmt die Philosophie.''" (''Philosophy is determined not by the object but by the mode in which the philosophizing subject exists and how it relates to itself in the movement of its perception'') (&lt;ref&gt;''Die menschliche Natur'', p. 56. See also ''Untersuchungen zu einer hermeneutischen Logik'', pp. 21-22, note 1.&lt;/ref&gt;) Philosophy is neither defined by a specific subject matter, nor a clearly delineated field of investigation; it cannot be compartmentalized into disciplines or taken into possession. "Philosophy" describes a direction and a point of view one cannot assume deliberately as it consists in an attitude that develops in direct opposition to my natural inclination. Philosophy does not intend to lay new grounds; rather it occurs "''als verantwortliche Übernahme schon geschehener Grundlegung''" (''as a responsible adoption of an already existing groundwork'').&lt;ref&gt;''Untersuchungen zu einer hermeneutischen Logik'', p. 62. See also ''Die menschliche Natur'', p. 56. Lipps's term "''Grundlegung''" is rendered here in parallel to English translations of Kant's "''Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten''".&lt;/ref&gt; In philosophy I become conscious of myself.

Philosophy traces back to, and brings to awareness, what has been present before without being conscious of itself ("''an ihm selber in seiner Vorgängigkeit unbewußt''"&lt;ref&gt;''Untersuchungen zu einer hermeneutischen Logik'', S. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;). Thus I seek to become aware of myself in my origins, and consequently attain an original relationship to reality, not by disposing of prior decisions - which would be impossible - but by accepting myself in these prior decisions. Such a philosophy is not geared toward enlightenment but toward a responsible appropriation of myself in my origins, toward a responsible performance of my existence, toward existing properly. In this regard philosophy specifically is '''[[Existentialism|existential philosophy]]'''.

The term of reference of philosophy is reality ("Wirklichkeit"), to which I have always already reached out and within which I have gained pre-predicative understanding of myself as well as of reality. It is in this relationship that reality becomes real and that the human being realizes itself. The reality of myself as well as of other people is directed toward the reality of things, which refers back to the former. It is only in such proportionality that anything exists at all. It is ultimately for this reason that everything that is real and to the extent that it is real refers back to my own and other people's (practical and theoretical) ability by which human existence is realized. Such relationship is therefore an "indicator of existential possibilities": a piece of iron, the color blue, vision, cognition, embarrassment, etc.

Philosophy unveils human existence as the center of reality - in analogy to the interpretation of a text. For Lipps, philosophy is therefore a '''hermeneutics of reality''' directed at human existence for the purpose of enabling the latter to its own realization. As Lipps understands it, "hermeneutics" necessarily implies a fundamentally retroactive dimension.

Philosophy qua hermeneutics of reality is tied up with ''language'', through which alone reality – both in terms of objects or things as well as of human beings - is being revealed. It is therefore the foremost task of philosophical inquiry to take up and follow the hints toward meaning and signification embodied in word and speech. And it must clarify those hints and explicate the pre-predicative mode of understanding they represent as grounded in the ''logos''. This leads to the problem of the openness of the meaning of words.In open contrast to Husserl's theory of the "Ideal unities of significance" Lipps emphasized the "open indifference" of many utterances whose meaning changes according to the change of speech situation. This resembles [[Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] conception of "[[language games]]" (a similarity seen for the first time by Gottfried Bräuer). A further similarity exists between Wittgenstein's "concepts with blurred edges" ([[Philosophical Investigations]]  § 71) and the "envisageing conceptions "&lt;ref&gt;''Untersuchungen zu einer hermeneutischen Logik''. S.92.&lt;/ref&gt; which in both cases are illustrated by the word "Spiel". There is, however, no trace of any influence on either side.

[[Hans Georg Gadamer]] writes in the preface to the edition of Lipps's works:
"In our days, Lipps's work should once again find its time. Mining in the quarry of language undertaken in England in the wake of Wittgenstein, Austin, and Searle has not only a predecessor, but an excellent counterpart in Hans Lipps. In questioning language, Lipps gains almost inexhaustible anwers. Among phenomenologists, Lipps's standing in unrivaled in his aural sensitivity for language and this perception of gesture."

== Description ==
[[File:Bulletin_-_Southern_California_Academy_of_Sciences_(2011)_(19881439204).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bulletin_-_Southern_California_Academy_of_Sciences_(2011)_(19881439204).jpg|thumb|An example of a haplotype network, used to show relatedness between populations based on shared haplotypes. In the case of haplotype convergence between populations, one might conclude from the haplotype network that these populations are more closely related than they are in reality.&amp;nbsp;]]
Haplotype convergence is rare, due to the sheer odds involved of two unrelated individuals independently evolving the exact same genetic sequence in the site of interest. Thus, haplotypes are shared mainly between very closely related individuals, as the genetic information in two related individuals will be much more similar than between unrelated individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brenner|first=Charles H.|date=2014-01-01|title=Understanding Y haplotype matching probability|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872497313002196|journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics|volume=8|issue=1|pages=233–243|doi=10.1016/j.fsigen.2013.10.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substitution bias further increases the likelihood of haplotype convergence, as this increases the probability of mutations occurring at the same site.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malhi|first=Ripan S.|last2=Eshleman|first2=Jason A.|last3=Greenberg|first3=Jonathan A.|last4=Weiss|first4=Deborah A.|last5=Shook|first5=Beth A.

Erroneously determining two individuals do be identical due to haplotype convergence becomes much less likely when more genetic markers are tested, since that would require a larger amount of extremely rare coincidences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gkbopp/DNA/CommonHaplotypes.htm#Convergence |title=Common haplotypes |date=14 December 2006 |publisher=ancestry.com |accessdate=28 March 2012}}{{better source needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With modern high-throughput sequencing approaches, sequencing a large set of markers, or even the entire genome, is much more feasible and greatly minimizes these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blair|first=C.|last2=Murphy|first2=R.

== Examples ==
In some regions, due to low diversity in the Y-STR gene (often used to study surname origin), haplotype convergence may confuse analyses, concluding unrelated individuals to be very closely related.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solé-Morata|first=Neus|last2=Villaescusa|first2=Patricia|last3=García-Fernández|first3=Carla|last4=Font-Porterias|first4=Neus|last5=Illescas|first5=María José|last6=Valverde|first6=Laura|last7=Tassi|first7=Francesca|last8=Ghirotto|first8=Silvia|last9=Férec|first9=Claude|date=2017-08-04|title=Analysis of the R1b-DF27 haplogroup shows that a large fraction of Iberian Y-chromosome lineages originated recently in situ|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07710-x|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-07710-x|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a study of New World [[mitochondrial DNA]] haplogroups observed that similarities in haplotypes between Native Americans and Asians were a result of the [[Hypervariable region|hypervariability]] of the HVSI region in mitochondrial DNA, rather than common ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malhi|first=Ripan S.|last2=Eshleman|first2=Jason A.|last3=Greenberg|first3=Jonathan A.|last4=Weiss|first4=Deborah A.|last5=Shook|first5=Beth A.

{{for|the Max Frisch novel|Homo Faber (novel)}}
{{merge|Artificiality|date=April 2018}}
'''''Homo faber''''' ([[Latin]] for "[[Human being|Man]] the Maker") is the concept that human beings are able to control their fate and their environment as a result of the use of tools.

== Original phrase ==

In Latin literature, [[Appius Claudius Caecus]] uses this term in his ''Sententiæ'', referring to the ability of man to control his destiny and what surrounds him: ''Homo faber suae quisque fortunae'' (Every man is the artifex of his destiny).

In older [[anthropology]] theories, ''Homo faber'', as the "working man", is confronted with ''[[Homo ludens]]'', the "playing man", who is concerned with amusements, humor, and leisure.

== Modern usage ==

The classic ''homo faber suae quisque fortunae'' was "rediscovered" by [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] in 14th century and was central in the [[Italian Renaissance]].

In the 20th century, [[Max Scheler]] and [[Hannah Arendt]]  made the philosophical concept central again.

[[Henri Bergson]] also referred to the concept in ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'' (1907), defining [[intelligence]], in its original sense, as the "faculty to create artificial objects, in particular tools to make tools, and to indefinitely variate its makings."

''[[Homo Faber (novel)|Homo Faber]]'' is the title of an influential novel by the Swiss author [[Max Frisch]], published in 1957.

== Other contemporary era mentions ==

''Homo faber'' can be also used in opposition or juxtaposition to ''[[Demiurge|deus faber]]'' ("God the Creator"), an archetype of which are the various [[Vulcan (mythology)|gods of the forge]].

''Homo faber'' is used by [[Pierre Schaeffer]] in the [[Traité des objects Musicaux]] as the man creator of music, which uses its brute experience, an instinctive practice in music creation; Concluding that the ''homo faber''  aways precedes the [[Homo sapiens]] in the process of creation.

Frisch' book was made into the film ''[[Voyager (film)|Voyager]]'', starring [[Sam Shepard]] and [[Julie Delpy]].

''Homo Faber'' was one of the five [[IB Middle Years Programme|IBMYP]] areas of interaction, before it was replaced with "Human Ingenuity".

The concept of ''homo faber'' is referenced in [[Umberto Eco]]'s "Open Work": he refutes its negative connotation and instead argues that ''homo faber'' is a manifestation of man's innate being in nature. Use of ''homo faber'' in this negative light is argued by Eco to represent the alienation from and objectification of nature.

"Homo Faber" is also the title of a short poem by [[Frank Bidart]] that is included in his collection ''Desire'' (1997).

''Homo faber'' is often placed in juxtaposition to ''homo adorans'', the worshiping man.  In other words, under traditional [[Judeo-Christian]] philosophy, the ultimate purpose of humankind is to worship God, whereas, under (for example) [[Marxist]] or [[Capitalist]] ideology, the purpose of humankind was embedded in what he or she can make or produce.

'''Ian Rumfitt''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} is a British philosopher currently serving as a senior research fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford]].

==Life==
He was educated at Victoria College, Jersey, at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was also a Junior Research Fellow, and at [[Princeton University]]. His graduate studies at Oxford were supervised by [[Sir Michael Dummett]]. He has taught at [[Keele University]], the [[University of Michigan at Ann Arbor]], [[University College, Oxford]], where he served as a tutorial fellow from 1998 until 2005, [[Birkbeck College, University of London]], where he was Professor of Philosophy from 2005 until 2013, and the [[University of Birmingham]], where he was Professor of Philosophy from 2013 until 2016.

He delivered the Nelson Lectures in Philosophy at the University of Michigan in 2004. He was founding co-director of the Centre for Logic and Language within the Institute of Philosophy, School of Advanced Study, University of London. He was awarded a Philip Leverhulme Prize in 2001. Since January 2016 he has been one of the editors of [[Philosophers' Imprint]].

His primary areas of research include the [[philosophy of logic]] and the [[philosophy of language]]. He also works in [[metaphysics]], [[model theory]], and the [[philosophy of mathematics]], with an interest in the works of [[Gottlob Frege]].

In July 2018 Rumfitt was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] (FBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britac.ac.uk/news/record-number-academics-elected-british-academy|title=Record number of academics elected to British Academy {{!}} British Academy|website=British Academy|language=en|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Rumfitt's work in the philosophy of logic culminated in the publication of ''The Boundary Stones of Thought'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2015). This book presents a sustained defense of [[classical logic]] against such philosophers as [[Michael Dummett]] and [[Crispin Wright]]. What makes Rumfitt's defense unusual is that he joins Dummett and Wright in rejecting the [[principle of bivalence]], the keystone of classical semantics. So Rumfitt presents and defends non-classical semantic theories for various problematical areas of discourse which nevertheless validate classical logic. The book also presents a solution to the [[Sorites paradox]] and a defense of [[Kripke–Platek set theory]] against the better-known [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]].

Rumfitt's earlier work in logic includes a 'bilateral' formalization of classical logic which avoids problems that have been held to attend its familiar 'unilateral' formalization. In the philosophy of language, he is also known for his work on plural terms, on [[Material conditional|conditional]]s, on ascriptions of know how, on indirect speech reports, and for his views on the relationship between truth-conditional theories of meaning in the style of [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] and the intention-based theories championed by [[Paul Grice]].

'''''Introduction to Metaphysics''''' ({{lang-de|Einführung in die Metaphysik}}) is a book by [[Martin Heidegger]] (published in Germany in 1953)&lt;ref name="Fried"&gt;''Introduction to Metaphysics'', trans. by Gregory Fried and Richard Polt New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; of a revised and edited lecture course he gave in the summer of 1935 at the [[University of Freiburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://think.hyperjeff.net/Heidegger |title=Quick reference guide to the English translations of Heidegger |publisher=Think.hyperjeff.net |date= |accessdate=2011-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is famous for Heidegger's powerful reinterpretation of Greek thought, but has been widely regarded as [[Fascism|fascist]] in character.&lt;ref name=Young/&gt;

==Overview==
{{rewrite section|date=September 2018}}
According to Heidegger, the fundamental question of metaphysics is "why are there beings at all instead of nothing?"&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 2000, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; From this fundamental question Heidegger extracts a prior question about the relation to Being; or "How does it stand with Being?"&lt;ref name="Heidegger 2000, p. 44"&gt;Heidegger 2000, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; This is to be answered through an analysis of Greek poetry, the etymology of the word being and of the answers given by philosophers such as [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]. To Heidegger, this question is not purely an academic endeavour, for metaphysics  grounds an age, by giving "that age the basis upon which it is essentially formed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heidegger|first1=Martin |title=The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays |publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]] |location=New York |year=1977 |page=115 |isbn=0-06-131969-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question thus inherently implicates the totality of human Dasein, and is asked so as to "restore the historical Dasein of human beings ... back to  the power of Being that is to be opened up originally".&lt;ref name="Heidegger 2000, p. 44"/&gt; This opens up the discussion of socio-political entanglements of Dasein and Heidegger's notion of the "inner truth and greatness" of [[Nazism|National Socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 2000, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Introduction to Metaphysics'' is famous for Heidegger's powerful reinterpretation of Greek thought and infamous for his acknowledgement of the [[Nazi Party]].&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt; Julian Young writes that it is a work which even those sympathetic to Heidegger have generally considered fascist in character.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young|first1=Julian |title=Heidegger, philosophy, Nazism |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |year=1997 |page=8 |isbn=0-521-64494-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the work has also been seen as being critical of Nazism for being insufficiently radical and suffering from the same spiritual impoverishment as the Soviet Union and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/response-gregory-frieds-king-dead-heideggers-black-notebooks |title=Response to Gregory Fried’s "The King Is Dead: Heidegger’s Black Notebooks" |publisher=https://lareviewofbooks.org/ |date= |accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic reviews===
''Introduction to Metaphysics'' was reviewed by the psychologist and philosopher [[Miles Groth]] in ''[[The Review of Metaphysics]]''.&lt;ref name="Groth"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Miles |last=Groth |title=Introduction to Metaphysics (Book) |work=The Review of Metaphysics |date=September 2001 |volume=55 |issue=1 |page=138}} {{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groth believed that the translation by Gregory Fried and Richard Polt would be "more congenial" to students of twentieth-century [[continental philosophy]] than the earlier English translation, but maintained that there were still important problems in Fried and Polt's attempt to make Heidegger's thought accessible. He wrote that their translation "falters with peculiar renderings of several Heidegger's basic words in this text", considering their rendering of  ''Sein'' as "Being" the most important example, and argued that there was no reason to leave "Dasein" untranslated, and criticized the omission of Petra Jaeger's afterword to the German edition, along with her detailed table of contents and related texts provided for the 1983 German edition. He described "Heidegger's readings of Heraclitus and Parmenides" as "famously idiosyncratic", and his "suggestion that they fundamentally agree" as "challenging".&lt;ref name="Groth" /&gt;

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Jo-ha-kyū'''''|序破急}} is a concept of modulation and movement applied in a wide variety of [[Japanese culture|traditional Japanese arts]]. Roughly translated to "beginning, break, rapid", it essentially means that all actions or efforts should begin slowly, speed up, and then end swiftly. This concept is applied to elements of the [[Japanese tea ceremony]], to [[kendō]] and other martial arts, to [[dramatic structure]] in the traditional theatre, and to the traditional collaborative linked verse forms [[renga]] and [[renku]] (haikai no renga).

The concept originated in ''[[gagaku]]'' court music, specifically in the ways in which elements of the music could be distinguished and described. Though eventually incorporated into a number of disciplines, it was most famously adapted, and thoroughly analysed and discussed by the great [[Noh]] playwright [[Zeami]],&lt;ref&gt;Zeami. "Teachings on Style and the Flower (''[[Fūshikaden]]'')." from Rimer &amp; Yamazaki. ''On the Art of the Nō Drama''. p20.&lt;/ref&gt; who viewed it as a universal concept applying to the patterns of movement of all things.

==Theatre==
It is perhaps in the theatre that ''jo-ha-kyū'' is used the most extensively, on the most levels. Following the writings of Zeami, all major forms of Japanese traditional drama ([[Noh]], [[kabuki]], and ''[[bunraku|jōruri]]'') utilize the concept of ''jo-ha-kyū'', from the choice and arrangement of plays across a day, to the composition and pacing of acts within a play, down to the individual actions of the actors.

Zeami, in his work "''[[Sandō]]''" (The Three Paths), originally described a five-part (five ''dan'') Noh play as the ideal form. It begins slowly and auspiciously in the first part (''jo''), building up the drama and tension in the second, third, and fourth parts (''ha''), with the greatest climax in the third ''dan'', and rapidly concluding with a return to peace and auspiciousness in the fifth ''dan'' (''kyū'').&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Shelley Fenno. "How to write a Noh play - Zeami's ''Sandō''." ''Monumenta Nipponica'', vol 48, issue 1 (Spring 1993). pp58-62&lt;/ref&gt;

This same concept was later adapted into ''jōruri'' and kabuki, where the plays are often arranged into five acts with  ''jo-ha-kyū'' in mind.  [[Takemoto Gidayū]], the great ''jōruri'' chanter, was the first to describe the patterns or logic behind the five acts, which parallel as well the five categories of Noh which would be performed across a day.&lt;ref name=Gerstle&gt;Gerstle, Drew (2001). ''Chikamatsu: Five Late Plays''. New York: Columbia University Press. pp16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

He described the first act as "Love"; the play opens auspiciously, using gentle themes and pleasant music to draw in the attention of the audience. The second act is described as "Warriors and Battles" (''[[Noh#Categories|shura]]''). Though it need not contain actual battle, it is generally typified by heightened tempo and intensity of plot. The third act, the climax of the entire play, is typified by pathos and tragedy. The plot achieves its dramatic climax. Takemoto describes the fourth act as a ''[[michiyuki]]'' (journey), which eases out of the intense drama of the climactic act, and often consists primarily of song and dance rather than dialogue and plot. The fifth act, then, is a rapid conclusion. All loose ends are tied up, and the play returns to an auspicious setting.&lt;ref name=Gerstle /&gt;

==Poetry==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
In 1356, it was [[Nijō Yoshimoto]] who established the sequential pattern of [[renga]], [[haikai]] and [[noh]] by requiring jo-ha-kyū for renga in his {{nihongo|[[Tsukubashū]]|菟玖波集}}&lt;ref&gt;Miner, Earl. ''Japanese Linked Poetry''. Princeton University Press, 1980. {{ISBN|0-691-01368-3}} p21&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Stuart Mackenzie''' (1860–1935) was a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], born near [[Glasgow]], and educated at Glasgow, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MKNY886JS|name=Mackenzie, John Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]].  In 1884-89 he was a fellow at [[edinburgh University|Edinburgh]] and from 1890 to 1896 fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].  He lectured on [[political economy]] at [[Victoria University of Manchester|Owens College]], [[Manchester]], in 1890-93, and in 1895 became [[professor]] of logic and philosophy in [[Cardiff University|University College]], [[Cardiff]].  Mackenzie was a [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] of the type of [[Thomas Hill Green|Green]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bosanquet]], and [[Edward Caird|Caird]].

==Biography==

John Stuart MacKenzie was born the second son of John Mackenzie and Janet Brown on 29 February 1860 at [[Springburn]], near [[Hogganfield]], Glasgow. When he was eight years old, his father decided to take the family to seek their fortune in [[Buenos Aires]]. Soon after their arrival, having spent seven weeks at sea, Mrs Mackenzie died of [[cholera]], and Mr. Mackenzie some weeks later. The two boys were sent back to [[Tollcross, Glasgow|Tollcross]] to be cared for by an aunt, attended the local school, and then Annfield House Academy, Glasgow. Mackenzie's elder brother went into engineering, while John entered the High School of Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner in Britain by Crispian Villeneuve. Temple Lodge Press 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-906999-03-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became interested in [[Descartes]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]], [[John Tyndall]] and [[Herbert Spencer]] and thus went on to study Philosophy at Glasgow University in 1977 studying under and befriending [[Edward Caird]] and Caird's assistant [[Henry Jones (philosopher)|Henry Jones]]. Having become particularly interested in German philosophy, he undertook further studies in Berlin. On completing his degree, Mackenzie won the Clarke fellowship and succeeded Jones as Caird's assistant. In 1886, encouraged by his friend [[William Ritchie Sorley|W.R. Sorley]], he began to study in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], where he became a close friend of [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] who introduced him to the philosophy of [[Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;The Continuum Encyclopedia of British Philosophy Edited by A.C. Grayling, Naomi Goulder, and Andrew Pyle Continuum 2010 {{ISBN|9780199754694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Shaw fellowship course of lectures he held at [[Edinburgh]], he chose the subject of [[Socialism]], having witnessed the poverty and depravation of the slums of Glasgow. The Shaw lectures were published as An Introduction to Social Philosophy in 1890. The book anticipated much of the social legislation that was to follow; the growth of adult education, unemployment insurance, and economic planning with respect to investments and labour. In 1889 he graduated from Cambridge with first class honours and became a fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and then an assistant to [[Robert Adamson (philosopher)|Professor Adamson]] at Manchester. In 1895 he became professor of logic and philosophy at Cardiff. His appointment is recorded in the Minutes of the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, 1890-95 in a  Special Meeting of Council, held on 19 December 1894, resolving that "Mr John Stuart MacKenzie MA Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge be appointed Professor of Logic + Philosophy at a stipend of £350 per annum, the appointment to date from Christmas 1894.&lt;ref&gt;[Minutes of the University of South Wales and Monmouthshire Council (Ref: UCC/Cl/Mn/30. Information provided by Cardiff University Institutional Archive, http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/govrn/cocom/recordsmanagement/archives/index.html.]&lt;/ref&gt; Here he met his future wife, the head of women's teacher training, [[Millicent Mackenzie|Hettie Millicent Hughes]] from [[Bristol]], author of the book ''Hegel's Educational Theory and Practice'', and erstwhile [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Candidate in 1918 for the University of Wales. In 1911 he received the honorary degree of [[LL.D.]] from Glasgow and was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.psa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/JS%20Mackenzie.pdf |title= Biography|publisher=The Political Studies Association|date= |accessdate=2014-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired in 1915 at the age of fifty-five in order to devote himself to writing and travel and both he and his wife travelled extensively after the end of the War. They toured India in 1920 and 1922 to lecture and took up contact with [[George Arundale]] in [[Adyar, Chennai|Adyar]] and [[Bertram Keightley]] in [[Benares]], both leading [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophists]]. On their return to England, Millicent’s friend [[Edith Maryon]], invited them to take part in the Summer Art Course in [[Dornach]], Switzerland, where they were deeply impressed by [[Rudolf Steiner]], with [[Anthroposophy]] and his work in [[Waldorf education|education]]. Rudolf Steiner was very appreciative of the work both of them had done particularly on the philosophy of Hegel. On their return to the UK once again, John Mackenzie continued to lecture and engage himself on behalf of the educational work of Rudolf Steiner that was being established in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner in Britain: A Documentation of His Ten Visits by Crispian Villeneuve. Rudolph Steiner Press; Reprint edition (31 October 2009) {{ISBN|978-1906999032}} P. 641 i.a.&lt;/ref&gt;

After living in Cambridge, London and Bristol, the Mackenzies returned to their country home at Brockweir. He died on 6 December 1935, and was cremated in Bristol. His memoires were published posthumously by his wife with a biographical sketch by W. Tudor Jones. The Mackenzie Hall, town hall of Brockweir, is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brockweirvillagehall.co.uk/history.html History of the Mackenzie Hall, Brockwell Village Hall retrieved 2014.09.09]&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Mackenzie's work stands as an important example of British idealist philosophy. He put forward no fundamentally new theses, but he demonstrated the extent to which the position could accommodate itself to new ideas, raising question as to why it ultimately fell out of favour. His style was not for precise or rigid argument, and he is always both tentative and modest. Suggesting that ‘in philosophy, every dogma is a heresy’, he argued that:
{{check quotation}}"…what I am inclined to claim for philosophy is not that it provides us with any ready made doctrines … but that it enables us to take a general survey of the totality of our experience, and to see clearly … that we have some right to hope and a still more manifest duty to strive. (Elements of Constructive Philosophy, p. 478)" (Quoted from The Continuum Encyclopedia of British Philosophy)

Also the following Citation has found its way in many books of latter authors.

:"(...) the distinction between what is real and what is imaginary is not one that can be finally maintained. (…). (…) all existing things are (...) imaginary." pp. 440 in "Elements of Constructive Philosophy"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4184">'''Joseph Kaipayil''' (born 1959) is an Indian philosopher, who expounds a relationalist theory of reality. He is professor of philosophy at Jeevalaya Institute of Philosophy, Bangalore.&lt;ref&gt; https://independent.academia.edu/JosephKaipayil&lt;/ref&gt; In his writings one finds a sustained and systematic articulation of [[relationalism]] as a distinct philosophical theory. His works include: ''The Epistemology of Comparative Philosophy'' (1995), ''Critical Ontology: An Introductory Essay'' (2002), ''Human as Relational: A Study in Critical Ontology'' (2003), ''An Essay on Ontology'' (2008), and ''Relationalism: A Theory of Being'' (2009).

==Critical ontology, ontic relationalism, and Being-principle==
Critical [[ontology]], ontic relationalism, and Being-principle are the three major concepts found in Kaipayil's thought.

Building on his basic understanding of philosophy as critical reflection on human experience (to form a rational theory of the world),&lt;ref&gt;''The Epistemology of Comparative Philosophy ''. Rome: Centre for Indian and Inter-religious Studies, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaipayil argues that [[ontology]], the theory of being, (and [[metaphysics]] for that matter) should be “critical,” meaning that it should be based on empirical experience. Any ontological and metaphysical postulations we make can claim epistemic justification, only if they are grounded in our experience of the world. In this regard, he agrees with the Kantian critique of human knowledge,&lt;ref&gt; As found in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]’s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781, 1787) &lt;/ref&gt; without, however, endorsing its agnosticism about metaphysics. Kaipayil further describes ontology as investigation of the being-principle of things.&lt;ref&gt; ''Critical Ontology''. Bangalore: JIP Publications, 2002. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''Human as Relational''. Bangalore: JIP Publications 2003. &lt;/ref&gt;

Coming to his relationalist thought, Kaipayil presents [[relationalism]] mainly as a theory of being, which addresses the metaphysical problem of the one and the many, i.e. the unity and the plurality of the world. His theory of being, which he prefers to call ontic relationalism, interprets the meaning of being in terms of the particular in its relationality. Entities are constituted by their multiple relationalities. According to ontic relationalism, particulars interrelate and constitute what we call reality.&lt;ref&gt; ''An Essay on Ontology''. Kochi: Karunikan Books, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''Relationalism: A Theory of Being''. Bangalore: JIP Publications, 2009. &lt;/ref&gt;

Integral to Kaipayil’s theory of being is his concept of Being-principle, conceived as the unity of the three primal principles - existence, intelligence, and force. Beings (particulars) are thought to be ontologically grounded in Being-principle, the supreme particular, and its radical relationality.&lt;ref&gt; ''Relationalism: A Theory of Being'' &lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation of Indian philosophy==
Kaipayil critiques the traditional view of classical Indian philosophy as intuitive and spiritual (in contrast with Western philosophy). Following the lead of Daya Krishna&lt;ref&gt; Krishna, Daya. ''Indian Philosophy: A Counter Perspective''. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1991. &lt;/ref&gt; and J.N. Mohanty&lt;ref&gt; Mohanty, J. N. ''Essays on Indian Philosophy''. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1993. &lt;/ref&gt; among others, Kaipayil argues that philosophy in India was equally rational and critical a pursuit as it was in the West. Kaipayil also questions the philosophical rationale of the faith-based classification of classical schools into orthodox and heterodox and the feasibility of comparative philosophy as a model for philosophizing.&lt;ref&gt;The Epistemology of Comparative Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;”Comparative Philosophy.” In ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', vol.1, edited by Johnson J. Puthenpurackal, 296-98. Bangalore: Asian Trading Corporation, 2010. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==

===Knobe Effect===
Knobe is arguably most widely known for what has come to be called the "Knobe effect" or the "side-effect effect". According to Jones (2009):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rather than consulting his own philosophical intuitions, Knobe set out to find out how ordinary people think about intentional action. In a study published in 2003, Knobe presented passers-by in a Manhattan park with the following scenario. The [[CEO]] of a company is sitting in his office when his Vice President of R&amp;D comes in and says, ‘We are thinking of starting a new programme. It will help us increase profits, but it will also harm the environment.’ The CEO responds that he doesn’t care about harming the environment and just wants to make as much profit as possible. The programme is carried out, profits are made and the environment is harmed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Did the CEO intentionally harm the environment? The vast majority of people Knobe quizzed – 82 per cent – said he did. But what if the scenario is changed such that the word ‘harm’ is replaced with ‘help’? In this case the CEO doesn’t care about helping the environment, and still just wants to make a [[profit (accounting)|profit]] – and his actions result in both outcomes. Now faced with the question ‘Did the CEO intentionally help the environment?’, just 23 per cent of Knobe’s participants said ‘yes’ (Knobe, 2003a).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This asymmetry in responses between the ‘harm’ and ‘help’ scenarios, now known as the Knobe effect, provides a direct challenge to the idea of a one-way flow of judgments from the factual or non-moral domain to the moral sphere. ‘These data show that the process is actually much more complex,’ argues Knobe. Instead, the moral character of an action’s consequences also seems to influence how non-moral aspects of the action – in this case, whether someone did something intentionally or not – are judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6809">{{Gnosticism}}
[[Valentinius]], a mid-2nd century [[Gnostic]] thinker and preacher, was among the early Christians who attempted to align Christianity with middle Platonism.  Valentinius pooled dual concepts from the Platonic world of ideal forms, or fullness ([[pleroma]]), and the lower world of phenomena, or emptiness ('''''kenoma''''', κένωμα).  Employing a third concept of [[cosmos]], what is manifest, Valentinian initiates could [[exegete]] scripture in light of these three aspects of correlated existence.

==The void==
{{quote|The pleroma is the abode of the [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Æons]] .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. they are, or they comprise, the eternal ideas or archetypes of the Platonic philosophy.  .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Separated from this celestial region by [[Aeon (Gnosticism)#Horos|Horus]] .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. or Boundary .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. lies the ‘kenoma’ or ‘void’—the kingdom of this world, the region of matter and material things, the land of shadow and darkness. Here is the empire of the [[Demiurge]] or Creator, who is not a celestial Æon at all, but was born in this very void over which he reigns. Here reside all those phenomenal, deceptive, transitory things, of which the eternal counterparts are found only in the pleroma. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. All things are set off one against another in these two regions: just as
:The swan on still St Mary’s lake
:Floats double, swan and shadow.
Not only have the thirty Æons their terrestrial counterparts; but their subdivisions also are represented in this lower region. The kenoma too has its [[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|ogdoad]], its decad, its dodecad, like the pleroma. There is one [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] in the supramundane region, and another in the mundane; there is one Christ who redeems the Æons in the spiritual world, and a second Christ who redeems mankind, or rather a portion of mankind, in the sensible world. There is an Æon [[Aeon (Gnosticism)#Anthropos|Man]] and another Æon [[Aeon (Gnosticism)#Ecclesia|Ecclesia]] in the celestial kingdom, the ideal counterparts of the Human Race and the Christian Church in the terrestrial. . . . The topographical conception of the pleroma moreover is carried out in the details of the imagery. The second Sophia, called also Achamoth, is the desire, the offspring, of her elder namesake, separated from her mother, cast out of the pleroma, and left ‘stranded’ in the void beyond, being prevented from returning by the inexorable Horus who guards the frontier of the supramundane kingdom.|Lightfoot|pp. 266-7}}
The ancient Greek term for emptiness or void (''kenoma''), as pertaining to Theodotus's exegesis of Gospel of John chapter 1 verse 3, is described in ''The Excerpta ex Theodoto of Clement of Alexandria'' (Casey, 1934).

==Hysterema==
Elsewhere, the usual antithesis to Pleroma is not Kenoma, but ''Hysterema'' (ὑστέρημα). As the system is reported by Hippolytus (vi. 31, p.&amp;nbsp;180) this word is used as the complement of the word Pleroma, denoting all that is not included in the meaning of the latter word. Thus the ''Horos'' or boundary is described as separating the Hysterema from the Pleroma, itself partaking of the nature of both; but preserving all inside fixed and immovable by permitting nothing from without to enter. We can understand in the same sense the passage in [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] (''[[Panarion|Haer]]''. 31, 4, p.&amp;nbsp;166), where the same name is given to the [[Demiurge]]; for it appears in the case of the word Hebdomas that the Valentinians gave to the Demiurge the name of the realm over which he ruled, and from which he had his origin. 

[[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus]] speaks of the Demiurge as ''karpos hysterematos'' ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XVII.|Iren. I. xvii.]] 2, p.&amp;nbsp;86; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XIX.|xix.]] 1, p.&amp;nbsp;90), probably, as Lightfoot suggests (''Coloss''. p.&amp;nbsp;335), in contrast with the description of the Christ as ''karpos pleromatos''. Marcus would seem to have used the word Hysterema, in the sense already explained, to denote the region outside the Pleroma (see [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XVI.|Iren. I. xvi.]] 2, p.&amp;nbsp;82), where, in his usual way of finding mysteries in numbers, he regards the former region as symbolised by the numbers up to 99 counted on the left hand, the latter by 100 counted on the right hand. As Marcus uses the word Pleroma in the plural number, so (see Lightfoot, ''l. c.'') he may have used Hysterema also in the plural number to denote the powers belonging to these regions respectively. But it seems to us likely that the assertion that Marcus counted a second or a third Hysterema is but an inference drawn by Irenaeus himself ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XVI.|I. xvi.]] 3, p.&amp;nbsp;83), from the fact that he found the name ''karpos hysterematos'' applied not only to the Demiurge, but to his mother, Sophia [[Sophia (Gnosticism)#Achamōth|Achamoth]]. 

Irenaeus ordinarily uses the word, usually rendered ''labes'' by the old Latin translator, in no technical sense, but with the general meaning of defect, commonly joining it with the words ''agnoia'' and ''pathos''. The word Hysterema is found also in ''Excerpt. Theod''. 2, 22 (Clem. Alex. pp.&amp;nbsp;967, 974), in the latter passage in a technical sense; but the context does not enable us to fix its meaning. Hysterema is said by Epiphanius (''Haer''. 24, p.&amp;nbsp;74) to have been used as a technical word by [[Basilides]].

'''Marcel Légaut''' (27 April 1900 &amp;ndash; 6 November 1990) was a [[France|French]] [[Christian]] [[philosopher]] and [[mathematician]].

==Biography==
Marcel Légaut was born in [[Paris]], where he received his Ph.D. in Mathematics from the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in 1925. He taught in various faculties (among them Rennes and Lyon) until 1943. Under the impact of the [[Second World War]] and the rapid French defeat in 1940, Légaut acknowledged the lack of certain fundamental aspects in his life as well as in the lives of other university professors and civil servants. That is why he tried to alternate teaching with farm work. After three years his project was no longer accepted and he left the University to live as a shepherd in the [[French Prealps|Pré-Alpes]] (Haut-Diois). Légaut had married in 1940, and between 1945 and 1953 he became the father of six children.

Twenty years after this renunciation of his social status (and the consequent rooting in common life), Légaut, almost sixty years old, started a deep and personal reflection around man’s condition and existence, which was captured in the two volumes of his main work: ''Human Accomplishment''.

Monsieur Portal, his mentor during his youth, had helped him discover that honesty and intellectual independence are essential to a vigorous, spiritual life. This wasn’t usual in the Catholic education of the time, where obedience and adherence to the prevailing doctrine took priority. M. Portal had learned something from the modernist crisis period.

Encouraged in this secular direction by M. Portal, Légaut ruled out the usual lifestyle in the Catholic system of the time (priesthood and religious life), and instead thoroughly followed the scientific path. As a result of these youthful decisions, but also by the way he lived the full engagement, Légaut became a leader of the Catholic students in the Normale Écoles during the interwar period up to the French defeat. He overcame the temptation of absolutizing his function as celibate leader in the group, and therefore Légaut didn’t consider himself as a philosopher, or a theologian of formation or occupation. His only degree was his tenacity and freedom of thought (other names for his responsibility). Writing as an older man, Légaut recovered his dream as a youth: to express spiritual life just as it is, in a sincere and honest way, avoiding utopian speculation.

Légaut died in [[Avignon]].

==Publications==
Marcel Légaut is the author of twenty books, sixteen of which have been published from 1970.

His main work, published in two volumes in 1970 and 1971, is ''L’accomplissement humain'' (Human Accomplishment). (Vol. 1: ''L’homme à la recherche de son humanité''; Vol.2: ''Introduction à l'intelligence du passé et de l'avenir du christianisme''. Prior to these, there is a small book called: ''Travail de la foi'' (1962). ''L’homme à la recherche de son humanité'' was published in English under the title "True humanity" (1982).

After 1971: ''Mutation de l’Église et conversion personnelle'' (1975), ''Priéres d’homme'' (1974, 1978, 1984), ''Débat sur la foi'' I y II (1972, 1977), ''Devenir soi'' (1981), ''Un homme de foi et son Église'' (1988) and ''Vie spirituelle et modernite'' (1992).

Légaut offers, in his books, his meditation, his testimony and his prayer, resulting from the intimate conversation he holds with himself, with his friends and with God. Meditation, testimony and prayer are, in every human being, the three categories corresponding to the different destinataries of intimate "conversation", which is, in short, the sort of communication that every spiritual life aims to achieve according to its deep instinct.

Légaut’s books are written with an authority or value that doesn’t come from an institutional command nor from a social reliability (command or reliability that would justify its separation from the rest and its leaning on a platform, either academic or other). Its truth comes from the full engagement of living and thinking deeply and freely, without calculation nor self-defence, immersed in "the very living waters of life" (Antonio Machado loved this expression by Teresa de Ávila).

In ''L’accomplissement humain'', Légaut reconsiders his itinerary, and that of his companions, during a century full of great upheavals and mutations, without forgetting to examine the failure of the churches, their current crisis, and thinking how they could truly come out of this decline. His response suggests «taking everything up again from the basis» through a conversion with the essential teachings of Jesus, and facing up without fear, that is to say, with faith, to mutation.
In order to take everything up from its origin, his thoughts were centered, in Vol I, around subjects as faith in oneself, married and paternal faith, and faith in the other and in front of reality, including one’s death and that of people who are close. An itinerary on self-knowledge, in line with "christian socratism" or "socratic christianism". A path leading to discover, by non ideological means, the faith in God, the following of Jesus and a spiritual style of how to act in the World, in the way of ferment, that includes an adult way of being in Christianity.

'''Miguel Reale''' (November 6, 1910 – April 14, 2006) was a Brazilian [[jurist]], [[philosopher]], [[academic]], [[politician]] and [[poet]]. Known as one of the most important jurists of Brazil. He is considered the greatest Brazilian [[philosopher]] of law of all time.

One of the leaders of [[Integralism]] in Brazil and ideologue of the "Brazilian Integralist Action", Reale subsequently adopted as ideology the [[social liberalism]].

Reale served as Secretary of Justice for the state of [[São Paulo]] in 1947. He founded the Brazilian Institute of Philosophy in 1949 and the São Paulo-based [[Inter-American Society of Philosophy]] in 1954. He was a member of the [[Brazilian Academy of Letters]].

He graduated from the Law Faculty of the [[University of São Paulo]] (1934), where he was professor (1941) and [[Rector (academia)|rector]] (1949-1950, 1969-1973). In addition, he received the title of professor emeritus of the University of São Paulo.

As a scholar, he became well known in [[Latin America]] and in [[Continental Europe]] for his works on [[law]] and [[philosophy]].

Was a prolific writer in the legal field, having written several classic works of Brazilian philosophical and legal thought. Among his works: Philosophy of [[Law]] and Preliminary Lessons of [[Law]].

Received notoriety when formulating the [[three-dimensional theory of law]] on which the law has three dimensions: [[social fact]], [[Value (ethics)|value]] and [[Law|legal norm]]. Briefly, his theory can be understood as follows: "The social fact ([[sociological]] aspect) is valued ([[axiological]] aspect) and, due to this, it produces a [[legal standard]]." Thus, the three dimensions of law come into connection through a peculiar cultural [[dialectic]] called "dialectic of polarity and implication."

In 1969 he was appointed by President [[Arthur da Costa e Silva]] for "High Level Commission" set up to review the 1967 [[Constitution]]. Resulted this work part of the text of [[Constitutional amendment|Constitutional Amendment]] No. 1, dated 17 October 1969, which consolidated the [[military regime]] in Brazil.

Was supervising the setting-up committee of the Brazilian [[Civil Code]] of 2002 whose project was sanctioned by President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], becoming the Law 10.406/2002. He is considered the chief architect of Brazil's current [[Civil Code]].

Miguel Reale had prominent role in the field of philosophy, occupying the following positions: Co-founder of the [[Brazilian Institute of Philosophy]] of Lisbon, Portugal. Organizing seven [[Brazilian Congresses of Philosophy]] (1950-2002) and the [[VIII Inter-American Congress of Philosophy]] (Brasilia, 1972). Special Rapporteur on the XII, XIII and XIV [[World Congress of Philosophy]] (Venice, 1958, and Mexico City, 1963, and Vienna, 1968). Lecturer specially invited by the [[International Federation of Philosophical Societies]] for the XVI and XVIII World Congress (Düsseldorf, Germany, 1978, and Brighton, UK, 1988). Organizer and president of the [[II Brazilian Congress of Legal and Social Philosophy]] ([[São Paulo]], 1986) and the third and fourth Congresses ([[João Pessoa, Paraíba|João Pessoa]], [[Paraíba]], 1988/1990).

'''Mount Ni''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|尼|山}}|p={{linktext|Ní|shān}}}}) is a hill about {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} to the southeast of the city of [[Qufu]]&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5350/ Extension Project of Temple and Cemetery of Confucius and the Kong Family Mansion in Qufu: Temple of Confucius at Nishan Mountain, Temple and Cemetery of Mencius and the Meng Family Mansion, Temple of Yanhui and Temple of Zeng Zi, Unesco World Heritage Tentative List]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Shandong]] [[Province of China|Province]], China. The hill is culturally significant because it is traditionally regarded as the birthplace of [[Confucius]]. It is also the site of a historical temple dedicated to [[Kong He]] (alias Shuliang He), the father of Confucius, a Confucian academy ({{zh|c={{linktext|尼|山|书|院}}|p={{linktext|Ní|shān |Shū|yuàn}}}}), and the Yusheng Memorial Temple ({{zh|c={{linktext|毓|圣|侯|祠}}|p={{linktext|Yù|shèng |Hóu|cí}}}}).&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

According to the [[Han dynasty]] historian [[Sima Qian]], Confucius parents to be, Kong He and Yan Zheng, went to pray at Mount Ni and Yan Zheng gave birth to Confucius afterwards.&lt;ref name=Chin&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d4As4v5ZaG8C&amp;pg=PA25 Ann-ping Chin: "The Authentic Confucius: A Life of Thought and Politics", Simon and Schuster, 2007, pg. 25]&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of the Temple of Kong He can be traced back to the times of the [[Northern Wei dynasty]] (386–535 CE). However, the temple was abandoned and restored repeatedly during the [[Later Tang dynasty|Later Tang]], [[Later Zhou dynasty|Later Zhou]], [[Song dynasty|Song]], [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]], and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] dynasties.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; A major reconstruction was undertaken during the [[Ming dynasty]] (in 1417 during the reign of the [[Yongle Emperor]]).&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; Further expansion of the temple followed during the [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; As a result, most of the extant structures of the temple date from either the Ming or the Qing era.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; The current architectural complex contains three sets of buildings, the Kong He Temple, the Confucian Academy, and the Yusheng Memorial Temple.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

The Kong He Temple consists of the following halls: the Dacheng Hall (literally "Hall of Great Achievement") dedicated to Confucius, a "Sleeping Palace" dedicated to his wife Qiguan, the Hall of Qi Shengwang and the Sleeping Palace of Qi Shengwang.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; The Yusheng Memorial Temple is dedicated to mountain spirit of Mount Ni.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; The Confucian academy contains a lecture hall as well as rooms that were used by the temple management staff.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; Other structures in the academy include the Erdai and Sandai Halls, the Liang Wu, the Lingxing Gate (灵星门), the Shen Bao, the Tudi Temple (dedicated to the local [[Tu Di Gong|Earth Deity]]), and the Guan Chuan Pavilion.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; The entire complex on Mount Ni is walled in.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

Outside the eastern enclosure wall lies the Confucius Cave ({{zh|c={{linktext|夫|子|洞}}|p={{linktext|Fu|zi |Dòng}}}}). According to the legend, Confucius was abandoned in this cave after birth by his mother because of his ugliness. The baby was then taken care of by a tiger and an eagle, which convinced his mother to take him back.&lt;ref name=Jing&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3leAld7M7p0C&amp;pg=PA31 Jun Jing: "The Temple of Memories: History, Power, and Morality in a Chinese Village", Stanford University Press, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multiperspectivalism''' (sometimes '''triperspectivalism''') is an approach to [[knowledge]] advocated by [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[philosopher]]s [[John Frame (theologian)|John Frame]] and [[Vern Poythress]].

Frame laid out the idea with respect to a general [[epistemology]] in his 1987 work ''The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God'', where he suggests that in every act of knowing, the knower is in constant contact with three things (or "perspectives") &amp;ndash; the knowing subject himself, the object of [[knowledge]], and the standard or criteria by which knowledge is attained. He argues that each perspective is interrelated to the others in such a fashion that, in knowing one of these, one actually knows the other two, also. Poythress developed the theme with respect to [[science]] in his 1976 book ''Philosophy, Science, and the Sovereignty of God'' and with respect to [[theology]] in his 1987 book ''Symphonic Theology''.

==Epistemology==
{{Contradicts other|date=September 2009|1=John Frame (theologian)}}

===The normative perspective===
Frame suggests that in all acts undertaken by humans there is some standard that serves as a guide, and that guide tells people what is the proper subject of inquiry, what actions they should pursue and avoid, what the [[universe]] is really like, and how knowledge should be sought. In his view, the marketplace of ideas is full of [[worldview]]s competing for the allegiance of each individual, and for some people, final allegiance to a system is due to [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], emotions, or [[politics|political]] affiliation, while for others it is their particular [[religion|religious]] [[tradition]] ([[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], [[Bahá'í Faith]], etc.) or [[secular]] [[philosophy]] ([[empiricism]], [[rationalism]], [[Marxism]], [[postmodernism]], etc.). Whatever serves as a person's final authority, Frame says, functions as his or her normative perspective.

Christians such as Frame believe that [[God]] has verbally [[revelation|revealed]] himself to mankind in the [[Bible]] for the purpose of providing everything people need for life. In this view, Frame suggests, God’s [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] word serves as the criteria by which all truth claims are to be checked, and God’s word dictates to [[human race|humanity]] who he is, the true nature of the world around us, and who people are in relation to God and the world. Thus, for Frame as for [[John Calvin|Calvin]], the Christian Scriptures serve as the [[Perspective (cognitive)|lens]] through which one ought to see and evaluate everything, and even in knowing the Bible, he suggests that one knows both the world and himself (and, conversely, in knowing them both one comes to know Scriptures better).

===The situational perspective===
With the situational perspective, Frame refers to the facts of reality or the objects of knowledge. With this perspective in mind, he says one must acknowledge the details of [[history]], [[science]], and evidences for various beliefs, and yet, science, history, and the evidences can never to be interpreted in a fashion that ignores or sets aside the binding nature of the normative perspective. Viewing things from Frame's situational perspective, one looks for how the normative perspective is expressed in everyday life.

Thus, without an understanding of the world, Frame says, one cannot rightly understand or apply Scripture to his or her life. For example, an argument against [[abortion]] might run:

# [[Murder]] is a [[sin]].
# Abortion is murder.
# Therefore abortion is a sin.

In Frame's scheme, the first point provides us with a normative command from the Bible, which serves as a timeless [[morality|moral]] principle. But in order to arrive at the conclusion one needs to know whether or not abortion is really the taking the life of an innocent, unborn person, which requires use of the situational perspective. One must consult [[medical]] examinations of the nature of a [[fetus]], the law of [[biogenesis]], and the abortion procedure itself, since without this crucial information one could never know whether the person was faithfully applying God’s word in one's life.

===The existential perspective===
With the existential perspective, Frame draws attention back to the person doing the knowing because, he says, individuals bring their personal dispositions, temperaments, biases, presuppositions, and life experiences to every act of knowing. A problem common to all epistemological endeavors is that if one tries to formulate a true-to-life epistemology, one apparently must examine each and every action performed, but formulating every action into propositions for evaluation is quite tricky. For this reason, the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] model of epistemology viewed the knowing enterprise as something hampered by human subjectivity and sought an objective mode of knowing that excludes Frame's existential perspective. Frame notes that the search for a purely objective knowledge is not only impossible, but also idolatrous. States Frame:

"Sometimes we dream fondly of a 'purely objective' knowledge of God—a knowledge of God of freed from the limitations of our senses, minds, experiences, preparation, and so forth. But nothing of this sort is possible, and God does not demand that of us. Rather, He condescends to dwell in and with us, as in a temple. He identifies himself in and through our thoughts, ideas, and experiences. And that identification is clear; it is adequate for Christian certainty. A 'purely objective' knowledge is precisely what we don’t want! Such knowledge would presuppose a denial of our creaturehood and thus a denial of God and of all truth." (DKG, 65)

===Integration of the perspectives===
Frame argues that in order to appreciate the richness of the human knowing process, one must see that every instance of knowing involves these three perspectives. [[Esther Meek]], following Frame's model closely, calls these perspectives the rules, the self, and the world, and emphasizing the existential perspective, she states, "Knowing is the responsible human struggle to rely on clues to focus on a coherent pattern and submit to its reality" (LTK, 1). Knowing in this sense is thus the process of integration by which one focuses on a [[pattern]] by means of various clues in the world, one's body-sense, and the norms for thinking.

Through this integration process the clues take on greater significance such that they are no longer seemingly disconnected occurrences, but rather meaningful portions that make up a greater reality. Yet, it is claimed, the pattern or integration, once achieved, retroactively throws light on the "clues" that made it up. The particulars retain their meaningfulness, but it is enhanced and transformed. These patterns now shape the knower, because, ideally, they connect her with a reality independent of herself. One comes to see the fullness of the pattern when its truth is lived in (or "inhabited"), thus extending one's self out into the world by means of that truth.

Much of this pattern-making process is inarticulatable, but Frame and Meek believe this more-than-words aspect of epistemic acts cannot be ignored because he sees it as crucial in the common, everyday process of knowing.

==Science==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
With respect  to [[science]], Poythress developed a multiperspectival approach, which he views as "a means of avoiding unhealthy [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]" (''Philosophy'', p.&amp;nbsp;103).

==Theology==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Poythress further expounded a multiperspectival approach to [[theology]] in his ''Symphonic Theology''.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and died in [[Yamgan District|Yamagan]], now [[Afghanistan]].

He is considered one of the great poets and writers in [[Persian literature]].  The ''[[Safarnama]]'', an account of his travels, is his most famous work and remains required reading in Iran even today.&lt;ref name="Ludwig 2009"&gt;[[Ludwig W. Adamec]] (2009), ''Historical Dictionary of Islam'', p.237. Scarecrow Press. {{ISBN|0810861615}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Nasir Khusraw was born in 1004 AD, in [[Qabodiyon]].&lt;ref name="Ludwig 2009"/&gt; He was well versed in the branches of the [[natural science]]s, [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]], [[Greek philosophy]], and the writings of [[al-Kindi]], [[al-Farabi]] and [[Ibn Sina]]; and in the interpretation of the [[Qur'an]]. He also studied [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Greek language|Greek]], the vernacular languages of [[India]] and [[Sindh]], and perhaps even [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; and had visited [[Multan]] and [[Lahore]], and the splendid [[Ghaznavid]] court under [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud]], [[Firdousi]]'s patron. He later chose [[Merv]] for his residence, and was the owner of a house and garden there.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Nāsir Khosrau |volume=19 |page=248 |first=Karl Hermann |last=Ethé |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until [[Hijri year|A.H.]] 437 (1046 AD), he worked as a financial secretary and revenue collector for the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] sultan [[Toghrul Beg]], or rather for his brother [[Jaghir Beg]], the [[emir]] of [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], who had conquered Merv in 1037. At around this time, inspired by a heavenly voice in a dream, he abjured all the luxuries of his life, and resolved upon a [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to the holy shrines of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], hoping to find there the solution to his spiritual crisis.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The graphic description of this journey is contained in the ''[[Safarnama]]'', which still possesses special value among books of travel, as it contains the most authentic account of the state of the [[Timeline of 11th century Muslim history|Muslim world in the middle of the 11th century]]. The minute sketches of [[Jerusalem]] and its environs are even today of practical value.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

During the seven years of his 19,000-kilometre journey (1046–1052), Nasir visited Mecca four times, and performed all the rites and observances of a zealous pilgrim; but he was far more attracted by [[Cairo]], the capital of [[Egypt]], and the residence of the [[Fatimid]] caliph-imam [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah]], the [[Imamah (Shi'a Ismaili doctrine)|Imam]] of the [[Ismaili]] [[Shi'a]] [[Muslims]], which was just then waging a deadly war against the [[Abbasid]] caliph of [[Baghdad]], and Toghrul Beg the Seljuk, the great defender of the Sunni creed. At the very time of Nasir's visit to Cairo, the power of the Egyptian Fatimids was in its zenith; [[Syria]], the [[Hejaz]], [[Africa]], and [[Sicily]] obeyed al-Mustansir's sway, and the utmost order, security and prosperity reigned in Egypt.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

At Cairo, he learned mainly under the Fatimid [[dawah|''dā‘ī'']] ("missionary") [[Mu'ayyad fid-Din al-Shirazi]], and became thoroughly imbued with the [[Shi'a]] [[Isma'ili]] doctrines of the Fatimids, and their introduction into his native country was henceforth the sole object of his life. He was raised to the position of ''dā‘ī'' "missionary" and appointed as the ''Hujjat-i Khorasan'', though the hostility he encountered in the propagation of these new religious ideas after his return to [[Greater Khorasan]] in 1052 A.D. and Sunnite [[fanaticism]] compelled him at last to flee. After wandering from place to place, he found refuge in [[Yamgan]] (about 1060 A.D.) in the mountains of [[Badakhshan]], where he spent as a hermit the last decades of his life, gathering a considerable number of devoted adherents, who have handed down his doctrines to succeeding generations.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

He died in Yamagan in present-day northern Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Ludwig 2009"/&gt;

==Works==
[[File:SafarNamehNaserKhosrou.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Safarnama|Safar Nāma]]-i Nāsir Khusraw.]]
*'''Safarnama''' ({{lang-fa|سفرنامه}})
'''''[[Safarnama]]''''' (The Book of Travels) is his most famous work. He visited dozens of cities in about seven years (1046, March 6 &amp;ndash; 1052, October 23) and wrote comprehensively about them, including details about colleges, caravanserais, mosques, scientists, kings, the public, the population, the area of the cities, and, of course, his interesting memories.  After 1000 years, his ''Safarnama'' is still readable for [[Persian language|Persian-speaking]] people.

*'''Diwan'''  ({{lang-fa|دیوان}})
Among his other works, most of the lyrical poems in his '''''[[Diwan (Nasir Khusraw)|Diwan]]''''' were composed in his retirement, and their chief topics are an enthusiastic praise of [[Ali]], his descendants, and al-Mustansir in particular, along with passionate outcries against Khorasan and its rulers, who had driven him from his home.  It also explores his immense satisfaction with the quiet solitude of Yumgan, and his utter despondency again in seeing himself despised by his former associates and excluded from participation in the glorious contest of life. Scattered through all these alternating outbursts of hope and despair, there are lessons of morality, and solemn warnings against the tricks and perfidy of the world, the vanity of all earthly splendour and greatness, the folly and injustice of men, and the hypocrisy, frivolity and viciousness of fashionable society and princely courts in particular.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

*'''Gushayish va Rahayish'''  ({{lang-fa|گشایش و رهایش}})
Another work of Nasir Khusraw is the [[Persian Language|Persian]] philosophical work "Gushayis va Rahayish" which has been translated into English by F.M. Hunzai under the title: "Knowledge and Liberation".  The work discusses creation, questions related to the soul, epistemology, creation, and Ismaili Islamic doctorines.  From a linguistic point of view, the work is an example of early philosophical writing in new Persian.

It is the same strain which runs, although in a somewhat lower key, through his two larger ''[[Masnavi (poetic form)|mathnavis]]'', the '''''Rawshana-i-nama''''' ({{lang-fa|روشنایی نامه}}) (or Book of Enlightenment, also known as ''Shish Fasl''), and the '''''Sa'datnama''''' (Book of Felicity). The former is divided into two sections: the first, of a [[Islamic metaphysics|metaphysical]] character, contains a sort of practical [[cosmography]], chiefly based on [[Avicenna]]'s theories, but frequently intermixed both with the freer speculations of the well-known philosophical brotherhood of [[Basra]], the [[Ikhwan al-Safa]], and purely Shi'ite or Isma'ili ideas; the second, or ethical section of the poem, abounds in moral maxims and ingenious thoughts on man's good and bad qualities, on the necessity of shunning the company of fools and double-faced friends, on the deceptive allurements of the world and the secret snares of ambitious men craving for rank and wealth. It concludes with an imaginary vision of a beautiful work of spirits who have stripped off the fetters of earthly cares and sorrows and revel in the pure light of divine wisdom and love.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

If we compare this with a similar [[allegory]] in Nasir's ''Diwan'', which culminates in the praise of Mustansir, we are fairly entitled to look upon it as a covert allusion to the eminent men who revealed to the poet in Cairo the secrets of the Isma'ili faith, and showed him what he considered the heavenly ladder to superior knowledge and spiritual bliss.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

A similar series of excellent teachings on practical wisdom and the blessings of a virtuous life, only of a more severe and uncompromising character, is contained in the ''Sa'datnama''; and, judging from the extreme bitterness of tone manifested in the reproaches of kings and emirs, we should be inclined to consider it a protest against the vile aspersions poured out upon Nasir's moral and religious attitude during those persecutions which drove him at last to Yumgan.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Of all other works of the author, the '''''Zaad al-Musafirin''''' (or Travelling Provisions of Pilgrims) and the '''''Wajh-i-Din''''' (or The Face of Religion) are theoretical descriptions of his religious and philosophical principles; the rest of them can be dismissed as being probably just as [[apocryphal]] as Nasir's famous autobiography (found in several Persian ''tadhkiras'' or biographies of poets), a mere forgery of the most extravagant description, which is mainly responsible for the confusion in names and dates in older accounts of our author.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

*'''Book on Mathematics''' ({{lang-ar|عجایب الحساب و عرایب الحساب}})

Nasir Khusraw wrote a book on mathematics which has now been lost.  He states in his other work that he could: ''not find one single scholar throughout all of Khorasan and eastern lands like myself [who] could grapple with the solutions to these problems''.  But he felt it his responsibility to take the task for readers he would never see, 'those yet to come, in a time yet to come'

== Poetry ==
Nasir Khusraw loved the Persian language and hated poets like 'Unsuri who, rather than give a realistic portrayal of Mahmud of Ghazna, found ways to extol his deeds. The following poem speaks to this aspect of Khusraw's poetry.

        '''Reproach Not the Firmament!'''
            By Nasir-i Khusrau
          Translated by Iraj Bashiri
         Copyright, Iraj Bashiri, 2004

     Reproach not the Firmament deep and blue,
     Forget thy stubborn nature to reveal a clue.
 
     Neither expect from the Firmament any joy,
     When your own star you knowingly destroy.
 
     Fruitless trees are, at best, fuel for fire, 
     Fruitless men, alike, to oblivion retire.
 
     Forget about fragrant tresses and lips sweet,
     About hedges, and tulip cheeks to greet.
 
     Lavish not praise on a filthy creature,
     With dastardly deeds as its only feature.
 
     Adore not with verse the Lie or the Greed,
     Smite down the infidels’ most cherished creed.
 
     Be not Unsuri, who groveling worshiped Mahmud,
     Lavished on him all flattery and paean he could.
 
     I pledge never to sprinkle before the swine,
     These precious, peerless Dari pearls of mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Poets/Pilgrim.html|title=A Brief Note on the Life of Nasir Khusrau|work=angelfire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The poetry of Nasir Khusraw is replete with advice and wisdom.  Being the representative of the Fatimid Imams in Khorasan, Nasir guided his followers through his poetry.  His Persian poetry is enjoyed by the average Persian speaker of today and is taught in grade school. Some of the fables mentioned in his poems were eventually to find their way to the West. Among them is the story of [[The Gourd and the Palm-tree]]:

{{quote|
Have you heard? A squash vine grew beneath a towering tree.&lt;br&gt;In only twenty days it grew and spread and put forth fruit.&lt;br&gt;Of the tree it asked: "How old are you? How many years?"&lt;br&gt;Replied the tree: "Two hundred it would be, and surely more."&lt;br&gt;The squash laughed and said: "Look, in twenty days, I've done&lt;br&gt;More than you; tell me, why are you so slow?"&lt;br&gt;The tree responded: "O little Squash, today is not the day&lt;br&gt;of
reckoning between the two of us.&lt;br&gt;"Tomorrow, when winds of autumn howl down on you and me,&lt;br&gt;then shall it be known for sure which one of us is the most resilient!"&lt;br&gt;{{lang|fa|
نشنیده‌ای که زیر چناری کدو بنی
بر رست و بردوید برو بر به روز بیست؟

پرسید از آن چنار که تو چند ساله‌ای؟ ---
گفتا  دویست باشد و اکنون زیادتی است

خندید ازو کدو که  من از تو به بیست روز ---
بر تر شدم بگو تو که این کاهلی ز چیست

او را چنار گفت که  امروز ای کدو ---
با تو مرا هنوز نه هنگام داوری است

فردا که بر من و تو وزد باد مهرگان ---
آنگه شود پدید که از ما دو مرد کیست}}}}

'''Oury Amos Cherki''' ({{lang-he-n|רב אורי עמוס שרקי}}.&lt;ref&gt;.תשובת הרב על שם משפחתו המדויק, אתר הרב&lt;/ref&gt; born in 1959, alternative spelling Uri Sherki&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ravsherki.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=23&amp;Itemid=101081|title=About Rabbi Uri Sherki|last=Administrator|website=ravsherki.org|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is chairman of Brit Olam – [[Noahidism|Noahide]] World Center, a senior lecturer at [[Machon Meir]], leader of congregation “Bayt Yehuda” in the [[Kiryat Moshe]] neighborhood of [[Jerusalem]] and has published numerous works on [[Jews|Jewish]] thought and [[Jewish philosophy|philosophy]].

==Biography==

Rav Cherki was born in [[Algeria]] in 1959. His grandfather, Eyzer Cherki, was a [[Torah]] scholar and community leader in Algeria and later in [[France]]. Eyzer served as the president of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] Federation of Algeria, a representative at the [[World Zionist Congress|Zionist Congress]] and was active in founding [[History of the Jews in Algeria|Jewish education in Algeria]]. Rav Cherki’s father was a businessman and held a [[doctorate]] in [[economics]] and supported his grandfather in his public activities.

Rav Cherki moved as a child to France for a number of years. He moved to [[Israel]] in 1972, where he studied at the "Netiv Meir" Yeshiva High School and later at [[Merkaz Harav]] Yeshiva under Rav [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]]. He also studied under Rav [[Léon Ashkenazi|Yehuda Leon Ashkenazi]], Rav [[Yehuda Getz|Meir Yehuda Getz]] and Rav [[Shlomo Binyamin Ashlag]]. He performed his [[military]] service in the [[artillery]] branch of the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]].

Rav Cherki is involved with the organization Rosh Yehudi and gives lectures around Israel, including specialized courses for Jewish educators on teaching [[Judaism]] to the general public. He taught a weekly class at the [[Technion]], [[Haifa]] for a number of years, and taught at the [[Hesder]] Yeshiva Binot in [[Ra’anana]]. Rav Cherki is one of the founders of the organization Brit Olam&lt;ref&gt;.האתר של המרכז העולמי לבני נח&lt;/ref&gt; - Noahide World Center which aims to raise awareness of the [[Seven Laws of Noah]] and to promote their recognition and fulfillment in the world. At the heart of the organization’s activities is giving spiritual and practical guidance to communities of Noahides. 

Rav Cherki publicly supported the “Jewish Leadership” faction of the [[Likud]] Party and the [[The Jewish Home|Bayit Yehudi]].&lt;ref&gt;.רעות הדר, הרב שרקי עזב את הליכוד לבית היהודי, באתר ערוץ 7, 29 בפברואר 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
He is married to Ronit, who holds a [[doctorate]] in [[biology]],&lt;ref&gt;הרב שרקי: הפמיניזם הדתי מתסכל נשים. 22.01.14 מדור יהדות באתר ynet בשיתוף עם אורות טלוויזיה יהודית&lt;/ref&gt; and they have seven children and reside in [[Jerusalem]]. His son, Yair Cherki, is a well-known [[journalism|journalist]] in Israel. Another of his sons, Shalom Yochai Cherki, was murdered in a terrorist attack in April, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;2015 באפריל16  רועי ינובסקי, חשד לפיגוע: גבר נדרס למוות בתחנת אוטובוס בי-ם, באתר ynet,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

Rav Cherki’s thought is heavily influenced by Rav [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] and Rav [[Léon Ashkenazi|Yehuda Leon Ashkenazi]] (Manitou) while incorporating his original interpretations. His has disseminated his teachings primarily in lectures on a wide range of topics that draw on his broad knowledge base ([[Torah]], [[philosophy]], [[science]], [[history]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.meirtv.co.il/site/rabbis.asp?rabbi=3774)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rav Cherki places a particular emphases on the meaning of Zionism and the establishment of the state of Israel. He asserts that the birth of modern political Zionism signified the “beginning of the redemption” (''atchalta d’geulah'') whose climax was the [[Balfour Declaration]], and the founding of the State of Israel signified the final act in the process of redemption. Thus, from the perspective of [[Halakha|Jewish law]], the Jews are, today, already in the “period of the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kipa.co.il/jew/51482.html |title=יהדות - אלו ואלו: האם יש מקום לומר הלל בברכה בערב יום העצמאות? |publisher=Kipa.co.il |date= |accessdate=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This being the case, he also maintains that the ultimate purpose of the Jewish people is a universal one, and that is to bring blessing to all humanity while respecting the distinct national identities within it, and not by the creation of a cosmopolitan “world-religion” that seeks to blur distinct national identities.&lt;ref&gt;Besheva newspaper, 31.03.16, http://en.calameo.com/read/0016608025ed16a124402&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, he champions the unique viewpoint that with the establishment of the state of Israel the time has come for the practical realization of this purpose and calls for the Jewish people to actively pursue it. Part of this program is the publicizing and formalization of the Noahide movement through the organization Brit Olam, which Rav Cherki heads&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/692/249.html)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==
Consistent with his method of teaching that emphasizes face-to-face instruction, Rav Cherki spends much time giving classes in various frameworks around Israel averaging 20 classes a week.&lt;ref&gt;שיעורים קבועים של הרב אורי שרקי.&lt;/ref&gt; These classes can be accessed in the archives of Machon Meir and on his personal website. His students have transcribed and edited many classes into book and booklet form, published mostly in Hebrew and French. The following is a selected list of his major publications:

'''Pedro Salvino Zulen Aymar''' ([[Lima]], October 12, 1889 - [[Lima]], January 27, 1925) was a [[Peru]]vian [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[librarian]] of Chinese descent, who dedicated the most part of his short life to the fight for decentralised politics and the defense of indigenous rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historiaperuana.blogspot.com/2008/06/pedro-zulen.html Historia peruana, 28.06.2008 (Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Son of Pedro Francisco Zulen and Petronila Aymar, on leaving the school directed by notable educator Pedro A. Labarthe, he entered the Faculty of Sciences of the [[National University of San Marcos]] in 1906 where he specialised in Natural Sciences and Mathematics. In 1909 he decided to transfer to the Faculty of Arts, focusing particularly on the study of philosophy. In 1912 he enrolled in the Faculty of Law. He was the promoter and one of the founders of the Pro-Indigenous Association in 1909, and held the role of general secretary until 1915, although his resignation from the institution was not made public until the following year. In 1916 he travelled to the [[United States]] in order to undertake post-graduate studies in Philosophy at [[Harvard University]], but his ill health (he suffered from tuberculosis) lead to his abandoning the attempt soon after classes began. He decided to return to Peru and settle in the city of [[Jauja]], [[Junín Region]], with two aims: to improve his health and, most of all, to leave Lima because of the harassment of Dora Mayer, an old Pro-Indigenous Association colleague. In 1919 he decided to run as a substitute delegate for Jauja province, but was arrested just before the election and sent to the regional capital, [[Cerro de Pasco]], accused of anarchism and instigating rebellion amongst the peasantry. This all took place thanks to the conspiring of his political enemies, who thus prevented his candidacy.

With his studies completed and having graduated with a BA that same year, he travelled to the United States for the second time in 1920 with the aim of restarting his previous university course at Harvard. As well as his academic studies in Philosophy, he also studied what would later become known as [[library sciences]] on his own account. He returned to Peru towards the end of 1923, having been appointed cataloger of the Library of the University of San Marcos the year before, and soon after becoming its acting director. Here he worked full-time on cataloguing the Library's collection of bibliographies, editing the "Boletín Bibliográfico" and completely reorganising the institution. Because of this work he is considered to be one of the pioneers or founders of Peruvian library science, and since 2002 the Central Library of the University of San Marcos has been named after him in a well-deserved tribute. In 1924 he graduated as a Doctor of Arts and was named, by request of his students, as assistant professor in the Faculty of Arts, teaching a course on Psychology and Logic which he completely rewrote based on his studies and academic experiences in North America. After his death, a letter from the amazed and intrigued British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] reached Lima, congratulating him on the contents of his doctoral thesis and asking him if the Peruvian philosophical movement was at the same level.

Zulen only published two works during his lifetime, his university theses, while two further texts were published posthumously by his mother and Dora Mayer. Apart from these books there were also innumerable newspaper articles on indigenous rights, decentralisation and university reform - Zulen himself had tried on two occasions to publish a selection of these in Spain (under the title of ''Gamonalismo y centralismo'' or ''Exploitation and Centralism''), but without success.

[[Image:Matthew Arnold - Project Gutenberg eText 16745.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The British poet and cultural critic [[Matthew Arnold]] adapted the German word ''Philister'' to English as the word ''philistine'' to denote [[anti-intellectualism]].]]

In the fields of [[philosophy]] and [[aesthetics|æsthetics]], the derogatory term '''philistinism''' describes “the manners, habits, and character, or mode of thinking of a philistine”, manifested as an [[anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]] social attitude that undervalues and despises [[art]] and [[beauty]], [[intellectualism|intellect]] and [[spirituality]].&lt;ref name="Unabridged 1951"&gt;''Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language – Unabridged'' (1951) p. 1260&lt;/ref&gt; A '''philistine''' person is a man or woman of smugly narrow mind and of [[Convention (norm)|conventional]] morality whose [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] views and tastes indicate a lack of and an indifference to cultural and æsthetic values.&lt;ref&gt;''College Edition: Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'' (1962) p. 1099&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 19th century, the contemporary denotation of ''philistinism'', as the behaviour of "ignorant, ill-behaved persons lacking in culture or artistic appreciation, and only concerned with materialistic values" derives from Matthew Arnold's adaptation to English of the German word '''''Philister''''', as applied by university students in their antagonistic relations with the townspeople of [[Jena]], Germany, where, in 1689, a row resulted in several deaths.

In the aftermath, the university cleric addressed the town-vs-gown matter with an admonishing sermon "The Philistines Be Upon Thee", drawn from the ''[[Book of Judges]]'' (Chapt. 16, 'Samson vs the Philistines'), of the [[Tanakh]] and of the Christian [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;''Benét's Reader's Encyclopedia'' Third Edition (1987) p. 759&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Word Research and Word History'', the philologist [[Friedrich Kluge]] said that the word ''philistine'' originally had a positive meaning that identified a tall and strong man, such as [[Goliath]]; later the meaning changed to identify the "guards of the city".&lt;ref name="Kluge"&gt; Friedrich Kluge, ''Wortforschung und Wortgeschichte''&lt;/ref&gt;  

== History ==
In German usage, university students applied the term '''Philister''' (Philistine) to describe a person who was not trained at university; in the German social context, the term identified the man ('''Philister''') and the woman ('''Philisterin''') who was not of the university social set.&lt;ref name="Unabridged 1951"/&gt;

In English usage, as a descriptor of [[anti-intellectualism]], the term '''philistine'''—a person deficient in the culture of the [[liberal arts]]—was common British usage by the decade of 1820, which described the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], merchant [[middle class]] of the [[Victorian Era]] (1837–1901), whose wealth rendered them indifferent to culture. In ''[[Culture and Anarchy|Culture and Anarchy: An Essay in Political and Social Criticism]]'' (1869), Matthew Arnold said:

{{Quotation|Now, the use of culture is that it helps us, by means of its spiritual standard of perfection, to regard wealth as but machinery, and not only to say as a matter of words that we regard wealth as but machinery, but really to perceive and feel that it is so. If it were not for this purging effect wrought upon our minds by culture, the whole world, the future, as well as the present, would inevitably belong to the Philistines. The people who believe most that our greatness and welfare are proved by our being very rich, and who most give their lives and thoughts to becoming rich, are just the people whom we call the Philistines. Culture says: “Consider these people, then, their way of life, their habits, their manners, the very tones of their voices; look at them attentively; observe the literature they read, the things which give them pleasure, the words which come forth out of their mouths, the thoughts which make the furniture of their minds; would any amount of wealth be worth having with the condition that one was to become just like these people by having it?”| Culture and Anarchy (1869) pp. 28–29. }}

The denotations and connotations of the terms ''philistinism'' and ''philistine'' have evolved to consistently describe the uncouth person who is hostile to [[art]], [[High culture|culture]], and the [[Intellectualism|life of the mind]], who, in their stead, prefers the life of [[economic materialism]] and [[conspicuous consumption]] as paramount human activities.

;17th century
Whilst involved in a lawsuit, the writer and poet [[Jonathan Swift]] (1667–1745), in the [[slang]] of his time, described a gruff bailiff as a philistine, someone who is considered a merciless enemy.&lt;ref name="Unabridged 1951"/&gt;

;18th century
The [[polymath]] [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749–1832) described the philistine personality, by asking:

{{quotation| What is a philistine? A hollow gut, full of fear and hope that God will have mercy!}}

Goethe further described such men and women, by noting that:

{{Quotation|... the Philistine not only ignores all conditions of life which are not his own, but also demands that the rest of mankind should fashion its mode of existence after his own.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}}}

In the [[comedy of manners]] play, ''[[The Rivals]]'' (1775), [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] (1751–1816) identifies a violent [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]] as 'that bloodthirsty Philistine, Sir Lucius O'Trigger'.

;19th century
The philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) identified the philistine as a person who, for a lack of true unity, could only define [[Style (visual arts)|style]] in the negative.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

;20th century
* In the novel ''Der Ewige Spießer'' (The Eternal Philistine, 1930), the Austro–Hungarian writer [[Ödön von Horváth]] (1901–38) derided the cultural coarseness of the philistine man and his limited view of the world. The eponymous philistine is a failed businessman, a salesman of used cars, who aspires to the [[Conspicuous consumption|high-life]] of wealth; to realise that aspiration, he seeks to meet a rich woman who will support him, and so embarks upon a rail journey from Munich to Barcelona to seek her at the World's Fair.
* In the ''Lectures on Russian Literature'' (1981), in the essay 'Philistines and Philistinism' the writer [[Vladimir Nabokov]] (1899–1977) describes the philistine man and woman as:

{{Quotation|A full-grown person whose interests are of a [[Economic materialism|material]] and commonplace nature, and whose mentality is formed of the stock ideas and [[Convention (norm)|conventional]] ideals of his or her [[Social class|group]] and time. I have said “full-grown” person because the child or the adolescent who may look like a small philistine is only a small parrot mimicking the ways of confirmed vulgarians, and it is easier to be a parrot than to be a white heron. “Vulgarian” is more or less synonymous with “philistine”: the stress in a vulgarian is not so much on the conventionalism of a philistine, as on the vulgarity of some of his conventional notions. I may also use the terms “genteel” and “bourgeois”. Genteel implies the lace-curtain refined vulgarity, which is worse than simple coarseness. To burp in company may be rude, but to say “excuse me” after a burp is genteel, and thus worse than vulgar. The term bourgeois I use following [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], not [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. Bourgeois, in Flaubert's sense, is a state of mind, not a state of pocket. A bourgeois is a smug philistine, a dignified vulgarian . . . generally speaking, philistinism presupposes a certain advanced state of civilization, where, throughout the ages, certain [[tradition]]s have accumulated in a heap and have started to stink.&lt;ref name="NabokovRussianLit"&gt;Nabokov, ''Lectures on Russian Literature'', essay ''Philistines and Philistinism''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* In the ''Lectures on Literature'' (1982), in speaking of the novel ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' (1856), about the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] wife of a country doctor, Nabokov said that philistinism is manifest in the [[Prude|prudish]] attitude demonstrated by the man or the woman who accuses a work of [[art]] of being [[obscene]].&lt;ref&gt;Nabokov, ''Lectures on Literature'', lecture on ''Madame Bovary''&lt;/ref&gt;

The first was the hypothetical ''Logoi'' (''Q+''), followed by Mark, then Matthew, then Papias's ''Exposition'', then finally Luke-Acts.]]

Advanced by [[Dennis MacDonald|Dennis R. MacDonald]], the '''Q+/Papias Hypothesis''' ('''Q+/PapH''') offers an alternative solution to the [[synoptic problem]]. MacDonald prefers to call this expanded version of [[Q source|Q]] the ''Logoi of Jesus'', which is supposed to have been its original title. ''[[Logos|Logoi]]'' is a Greek term that means "words."

The Q+/PapH has similarities to previous solutions to the synoptic problem. Like the [[Two-document hypothesis]] (2DH), the Q+/PapH affirms that both Matthew and Luke have used a Q document. Like the [[Farrer hypothesis]] (FH), it affirms that Matthew used Mark and that Luke used both Mark and Matthew. Like the Modified Two-Document Hypothesis (M2DH), it affirms that Mark also used the Q document.

== Reconstructing the ''Logoi of Jesus'' (Q+)==

===Primitivity===
When two or more texts contain parallel content, the Q+/Papias Hypothesis uses the following criteria to determine which version is more primitive:
*An independent version is more primitive than one within a narrative context
*A unified version is more primitive than one that appears in multiple contexts
*When a saying relies on a biblical text, a version which is closer to the antecedent text is more primitive than one which obfuscates the relationship 
*A version that exhibits awkwardness is more primitive than one that seems to have been improved
*A version that is pithy and balanced is more primitive than one containing explications
*A version exhibiting the redactional qualities of its host text is less primitive than one that is atypical within its host text{{sfn|MacDonald|2012|p=96-97}}
When the decision of primitivity alternates between different texts (instead of one text always exhibiting a more primitive version), this situation allows for the possibility that the texts in question must have used another, earlier document. In the case of the Synoptics, the Q+/PapH suggests that this earlier text is the Logoi of Jesus (Q+).

===Matthew's Minimal Q (MQ-)===
In order to reconstruct the Logoi of Jesus (Q+), the Q+/Papias Hypothesis begins by establishing a minimal version of Q used by Matthew ('''MQ-'''). MQ- can be reconstructed by reference to only Matthew and Mark because of two considerations:
*Matthew contains a number of doublets (two tellings of the same story) which is presumably the result of Matthew taking one from Q and one from Mark. Sometimes the version Matthew takes from Q meets the criteria for '''primitivity''' against Mark's and appear to have even served as a source for Mark's version.
*There exist non-doublets in Matthew (instances where Matthew ''could'' have included Mark's account but does not do so, presumably because Matthew found the non-Markan version preferable and sufficient).{{sfn|MacDonald|2012|p=95}}
The cases of '''inverted priority''' - that is, when the content of a latter Gospel (Matthew) is deemed to be more '''primitive''' than the content of an earlier Gospel (Mark) - are the impetus for believing that Matthew and Mark used a Q document.

===Matthew's Expanded Q (MQ+)===
The next step according to the Q+/Papias Hypothesis is to expand Matthew's Q ('''MQ+'''). According to MacDonald, "There is no reason to think that Matthew relied on a second source only in these cases of doublets and nondoublets."{{sfn|MacDonald|2012|p=115}}

The three types of logia used to expand MQ- into MQ+ are:
# Logia in Matthew that are deemed to be more primitive than the corresponding logia in Mark
# Logia in Matthew that may reflect the material upon which Mark has performed a '''secondary redaction'''
# Logia that appear in Matthew but not in Mark{{sfn|MacDonald|2012|p=115}}{{sfn|MacDonald|2012|p=116}}

The Q+/PapH uses four criteria to determine whether a logion should be included in MQ+:
*'''Criterion A''' - '''[[Q+/Papias Hypothesis#Primitivity|Inverted Priority]]''': The logion in Matthew exhibits a more primitive quality than the corresponding logion in Mark. This criterion can be applied in the cases of the first two types of logia.
*'''Criterion B''' - '''Evidence of Tradition''': The logion in Matthew exhibits evidence that Matthew inherited it.
*'''Criterion C''' - '''Congruence with Minimal MQ''': The logion in Matthew coheres with other logia identified as belonging to Matthew's pre-Markan source via Criterion A.
*'''Criterion D''' - '''Explanation for Mark's Omission or Transformation''': The logion is preserved by Matthew which the interpreter can posit a plausible explanation for why Mark omitted or "radically transformed" it if he would have seen it in Q.{{sfn|MacDonald|2012|p=116}}

===The ''Logoi of Jesus'' (Q+)===
The final step in reconstructing the ''Logoi of Jesus'' ('''Q+''') is to bring [[Gospel of Luke|Luke's Gospel]] into consideration and to put the logia in order.

The same four criteria used to construct MQ+ are again used for logia from Luke's Gospel (and some from the [[Acts of the Apostles]]), with Criterion A, inverted priority, being most pertinent.

MacDonald introduces six new criteria for establishing the order of the ''Logoi of Jesus'':
* '''Criterion 1''': If all three Synoptic Gospels preserve the same order for certain logia, then it is wisest to follow this order as well.
* '''Criterion 2''': If a logion appears in only one Gospel, its location should be determined relative to the other content from the ''Logoi of Jesus'' in that Gospel.
* '''Criterion 3''': If logia shared by Matthew and Luke, but not Mark, agree in sequence, and if the Lukan versions exhibit inverted priority to the Matthean version, then this sequence is to be preferred.
* '''Criterion 4''': If two or more logia are "indebted to a biblical antecedent," referring to the biblical text being used may suggest the appropriate order.
* '''Criterion 5''': If different Gospels present logia in different orders, the interpreter should consider the Evangelists' literary tendencies and prefer the order that "displays the least redactional dislocation."
* '''Criterion 6''': If different Gospels present logia in different orders, the interpreter should also prefer the order that makes the most sense within the sequence of other material attributed to the ''Logoi of Jesus''.{{sfn|MacDonald|2012|p=172}}

MacDonald writes, "I confess to an aesthetic prejudice: the lost Gospel was coherent and resembled other ancient books, unlike the textual reconstructions of Q offered in ''CEQ'' or Fleddermann, which are fragmentary, often incoherent, and literarily ''sui generis''."{{sfn|MacDonald|2012|p=173}}

Whereas most previous attempts at reconstructing Q use the chapter-verse numbering from Luke's Gospel, MacDonald's reconstruction introduces a new numbering system: three hundred eighty-nine verses comprising ten chapters.

==The ''Logoi of Jesus'' and Deuteronomy==
As reconstructed by MacDonald, the ''Logoi of Jesus'' appears to have been structured as a rewriting, or [[Mimesis Criticism|imitation]], of [[Deuteronomy]]. The title, ''Logoi of Jesus'', itself evokes Deuteronomy 1:1 ([[Septuagint|{{smallcaps|lxx}}]]), "These are the ''logoi'' that Moses spoke..." MacDonald summarizes, "the ''Logoi of Jesus'' was not a loose assortment of traditional sayings clumsily gathered into speeches: it was a strategic rewriting of Deuteronomy with a coherent and compelling structure and plot. To be sure, it is not a narrative such as one finds in the Synoptics, but it is a narrative nonetheless."{{sfn|MacDonald|2012|p=505-512}}

==Mark and Q==

Like the M2DH,  the Q+/Papias Hypothesis holds that [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] used the Q document in composing his Gospel. This is unorthodox because scholars of the synoptic problem have generalized Q as consisting of the overlapping material in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] minus the content they both share with Mark (or, Q = [Matt || Luke] - Mark).

==The significance of Papias==

After constructing a Q+ document, MacDonald turns his attention to the second-century CE Christian writer [[Papias of Hierapolis]]. In some of the few fragments of his writings that remain, Papias attempts to solve the synoptic problem. He knew of the [[Gospel of Mark]] and what he understood to be two translations of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] into Greek (from a Hebrew original). MacDonald suggests that the texts Papias in fact had were Matthew's Gospel and the ''Logoi of Jesus'', which could easily be confused as an abridged version of Matthew.

==Implications for the historical Jesus==

One of the most critical criteria for establishing the [[historical Jesus]] is the criterion of multiple attestation, that is, the description or saying of Jesus is attested in multiple, independent sources. For instance, in [[John P. Meier|John Meier's]] work, ''A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus'', Meier identifies four independent sources for reconstructing the historical Jesus within the New Testament: Q, Mark, Paul, and John.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus'' (4 vol.) (Anchor Yale Bible Reference Library; Yale University Press, 1991-2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Historical Jesus scholars using the [[four-source hypothesis]] have even more independent sources at their disposal; in addition to Q, Mark, Paul, and John, they have the [[M-Source]] and the [[L source]]. Some scholars also include [[Agrapha]] and [[Apocryphal gospels]], such as the [[Gospel of Thomas]]. (Most scholars consider these to be dependent upon the [[Canonical gospels]], however.)

The Q+/Papias Hypothesis, on the other hand, dramatically reduces the number of independent sources. Q and Mark are not independent sources for the Historical Jesus because the Q+/PapH claims that Mark used Q. John also cannot be a source of independent attestation because the Q+/PapH holds that John redacted Mark and/or Luke. By [[Dennis MacDonald|MacDonald's]] assessment, the Q+/PapH leaves scholars with two only independent sources for reconstructing the Historical Jesus: the Logoi of Jesus (Q+) and the undisputed [[Pauline epistles]].{{sfn|MacDonald|2012|p=543-553}}

==Scholarly reception==

Early reception of MacDonald's Q+/Papias Hypothesis has been positive. While the initial reviewers have been cautious about categorically embracing the Q+/PapH, they agree that MacDonald's contribution advances the debate about the synoptic problem. [[John Kloppenborg]], one of the editors of the Critical Edition of Q,&lt;ref&gt;[[James M. Robinson]], Paul Hoffmann, and [[John Kloppenborg|John S. Kloppenborg]], ed., ''The Critical Edition of Q: Synopsis including the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, Mark and Thomas with English, German, and French translations of Q and Thomas'' (Fortress Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; offers the following review, "In spite of various methodological problems, there is no doubt that MacDonald's ''Two Shipwrecked Gospels'' is worth careful scrutiny and should provoke some reassessment of the extent of Q."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kloppenborg |first=John |author-link=John Kloppenborg |title=Review of Dennis R. MacDonald, Two Shipwrecked Gospels: The Logoi of Jesus and Papias's Exposition of the Logia about the Lord |journal=[[Review of Biblical Literature]] |date=February 2013 |url=http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/8565_9389.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=2 October 2018 |via=Book Reviews |publisher=[[University of Toronto]] |pages=1-6 |agency=[[Society of Biblical Literature]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer, James F. McGrath, writes, "MacDonald offers a possible way of preserving what is strongest in the current competing paradigms, while also identifying their weaknesses, and finding a third option that may prove satisfactory to proponents of both. Consequently, future research into the synoptic problem cannot afford to take for granted another paradigm without at least engaging the proposal MacDonald offers."&lt;ref&gt;James F. McGrath, review of Dennis R. MacDonald, ''Two Shipwrecked Gospels: The Logoi of Jesus and Papias's Exposition of the Logia about the Lord'', [http://www.bookreviews.org ''Review of Biblical Literature''] (2013). [http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/8565_9390.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Q Section of the [[Society of Biblical Literature]] used MacDonald's book as a starting point for one of its sessions at the 2013 Annual Meeting in Baltimore, MD.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4726">'''Radulphus Brito''' (c. 1270 - 1320) was an influential [[Philologist|grammarian]] and [[philosopher]], based in [[Paris]]. He is usually identified as '''Raoul le Breton''', though this is disputed by some.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Luc Deuffic (2002) identifies the two.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Confusion is possible since the contemporary [[Raoul de Presles]] (1316—1382) is also sometimes known as Raoul le Breton.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides works of grammatical speculation &amp;mdash; he was one of the [[Modistae]] &amp;mdash; he wrote on [[Aristotle]], [[Boethius]] and [[Priscian]].

Radulphus was Master of arts in the [[University of Paris]] in 1296, and joined the theology faculty in 1311. Very few of his works are edited, although he was a prolific and influential writer. He was one of a group of grammarians called the ''modistae'' or modists who flourished around Paris from about 1260 to 1310, so-called because they wrote on the mode of signifying.

'''Réginald Marie Garrigou-Lagrange''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Dominican Order|OP]]}} ({{IPA-fr|gaʁigu lagrɑ̃ʒ|lang}}; February 21, 1877 – February 15, 1964) was a French [[Catholicism|Catholic]] theologian. He has been noted as a leading [[neo-Thomist]] of the 20th century, along with [[Jacobus Ramírez]], [[Édouard Hugon]], and [[Martin Grabmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught at the Dominican [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, the ''Angelicum'']], in Rome from 1909 to 1960. Here he wrote his magnum opus, ''[[The Three Ages of the Interior Life]]'' (Les Trois Ages de la Vie Interieure) in 1938.

In 1918 Garrigou initiated courses in sacred art, mysticism, and aesthetics at the ''Angelicum''&lt;ref name="Renz2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher J. Renz|title=In This Light Which Gives Light: A History of the College of St. Albert the Great (1930-1980)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8qt63uOg6IC&amp;pg=PA44|date=September 2009|publisher=Dominican School|isbn=978-1-883734-18-3|pages=44–}}&lt;/ref&gt; influencing future liturgical artists such as [[Marie Alain Couturier]], who studied theology there from 1930 to 1932.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.library.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/CouturierCollection.pdf Accessed 4 Dec., 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born Gontran-Marie Garrigou Lagrange on February 21, 1877, in [[Auch]], near [[Toulouse]], France. While studying medicine at [[Bordeaux]] he experienced what he described as a religious conversion after reading ''Life, Science, and Art'' by the Breton writer [[Ernest Hello]] (1828–85). He joined the French Dominicans and studied and taught at Le Saulchoir before moving to Rome, where he lectured at the ''Angelicum'' from 1909 until his retirement in 1960. In 1917 a special professorship in ascetical and mystical theology was created for him at the ''Angelicum'', the first of its kind anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name="CoulterMyers2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael L. Coulter|author2=Richard S. Myers|author3=Joseph A. Varacalli|title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Social Thought, Social Science, and Social Policy: Supplement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3zM1injK8QC&amp;pg=PA124|year=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-8266-9|pages=124–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==
He is best known for his spiritual theology. His ''magnum opus'' in the field is ''[[The Three Ages of the Interior Life]]'' (Les Trois Ages de la Vie Interieure),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianperfection.info/ ''The Three Ages of the Interior Life''] Online text.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he propounded the thesis that infused [[contemplation]] and the resulting [[mysticism|mystical]] life are in the normal way of holiness of [[Christianity|Christian]] perfection. This influenced the section entitled "Chapter V: The Universal Call to Holiness in the Church" in the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, ''[[Lumen gentium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hprweb.com/2009/04/rehabilitation-of-garrigou-lagrange/|title=Rehabilitation of Garrigou-Lagrange|author=[http://fatherbtm.com/ Mullady, Brian, O.P.]|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His great achievement was to synthesise the highly abstract writings of St Thomas Aquinas with the experiential writings of St. John of the Cross, attempting to show they are in perfect harmony with each other.&lt;ref&gt;"A saint in Heaven", by Fr. Thomas Crean, http://www.christendom-awake.org/pages/thomas-crean/saint-in-heaven.htm Accessed 4-10-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Garrigou-Lagrange, the leading proponent of "strict observance [[Thomism]]", attracted wider attention when in 1946 he wrote against the [[Nouvelle Théologie]] theological movement, criticising it as [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernist]].&lt;ref&gt;See “[http://www.cfnews.org/gg-newtheo.htm Where is the New Theology Leading Us?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004223423/http://www.cfnews.org/gg-newtheo.htm |date=2013-10-04 }}.” See also his later article "[http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/hg_gl.html The structure of the encyclical ''Humani generis'']" and&lt;/ref&gt; He is also said to be the drafter of [[Pope Pius XII]]'s 1950 [[Papal encyclical|encyclical]] ''[[Humani generis]]'', subtitled "Concerning Some False Opinions Threatening to Undermine the Foundations of Catholic Doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iteadthomam.blogspot.com/2010/09/quaeritur-who-are-post-conciliar.html#4576892519299681515 |title= Quaeritur: Who are the Post-Conciliar Traditional Catholic Thomists? |date= 2010-10-23 |accessdate= 2011-06-19 |last= Carrasquillo

| work = Ite ad Thomam: "Go to Thomas!"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The ''Osservatore Romano'', Dec. 9-10, 1950, lists Garrigou-Lagrange among the names of the preparatory commission for the definition of the [[Assumption of Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ts.mu.edu/readers/content/pdf/12/12.4/12.4.4.pdf Accessed 2-6-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrigou-Lagrange taught many eminent Catholic theologians during his academic career at the ''Angelicum''. He also supervised the doctoral research of [[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], who was ordained in 1919 and completed his doctorate in theology in 1920 with a dissertation entitled ''De contemplatione''.&lt;ref&gt;Praeambula Fidei: Thomism And the God of the Philosophers, Ralph McInerny, 2006, https://books.google.com/books?id=3FY1gtVu37sC&amp;pg=PA108 Accessed May 24, 2012; Nouvelle Théologie and Sacramental Ontology: A Return to Mystery, Hans Boersma, 2009, 136 https://books.google.com/books?id=514HmFl5y9AC&amp;pg=PA136#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Accessed May 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In the period between World War II and the Cold War Garrigou-Lagrange was the "torchbearer of orthodox [[Thomism]]" against Modernism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/le-eredita-2-i-postumi-della-crisi-modernista_(Cristiani-d'Italia)/ Accessed 10 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1926 he served as the definitive consulter to [[Pope Pius XI]] in declaring [[John of the Cross]] a doctor of the church.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avvenire.it/Cultura/Pagine/il-tomista-assalto.aspx  Accessed 17 Feb., 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

He is commonly held to have influenced the decision in 1942 to place the privately circulated book ''Une école de théologie: le Saulchoir'' (Étiolles 1937) by [[Marie-Dominique Chenu]], [[Dominican Order|O.P.]], on the Vatican's "Index of Forbidden Books" as the culmination of a polemic within the [[Dominican Order]] between the ''Angelicum'' supporters of a speculative scholasticism and the French revival Thomists who were more attentive to historical hermeneutics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/le-eredita-2-i-postumi-della-crisi-modernista_(Cristiani-d'Italia)/ Accessed 10 September 2013; Y. Congar, Chrétiens désunis. Principes d’un œcuménisme catholique, Paris 1937; ''The HarperCollins Encyclopedia of Catholicism'', 304, https://books.google.com/books?id=7DmZB8fy_wcC&amp;pg=PA303#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Accessed November 13, 2012; https://books.google.com/books?id=3FY1gtVu37sC&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Accessed 10 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrigou-Lagrange gave the retreat in Paris which attracted [[Yves Congar]] to leave the diocesan seminary in order to join the Dominicans.&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Kerr, ''Twentieth-Century Catholic Theologians'', (Blackwell, 2007), p10.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Congar's methodology was suspected of Modernism because it seemed to derive more from religious experience than from syllogistic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/le-eredita-2-i-postumi-della-crisi-modernista_(Cristiani-d'Italia)/ Accessed 10 September 2013; Y. Congar, Chrétiens désunis. Principes d’un œcuménisme catholique, Paris 1937; ''The HarperCollins Encyclopedia of Catholicism'', 304, https://books.google.com/books?id=7DmZB8fy_wcC&amp;pg=PA303#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Accessed November 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrigou-Lagrange also supervised the doctoral research of [[Maurice Zundel]] who completed his dissertation in 1927 with a dissertation entitled ''L'Influence du nominalisme sur la pensée chrétienne''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.annesigier.qc.ca/zundel/biographie.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825085028/http://www.annesigier.qc.ca/zundel/biographie.html |archivedate=2013-08-25 |df= }} Accessed 26 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most famous of his students was the future [[Pope John Paul II]], who was supervised by Garrigou-Lagrange for his doctoral research in the mid-1940s at the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas|''Angelicum'']], and whose [[Papal encyclical|encyclical]] ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' is attributed to his training under the learned Dominican.

He died February 15, 1964, in Rome. The International Dominican Foundation (IDF) established Réginald de Rocquois Foundation in his memory at Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas where he taught most of his career, which grants annual Réginald de Rocquois scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IDF Serving the Dominican Order and the Church|publisher=IDF News, International Dominican Foundation| url = http://internationaldominicanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IDF_newsletter_july2012.pdf|date=July 2012| accessdate = 2014-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7732">'''Robert N. Audi''' (born November 1941) is an [[American philosopher]] whose major work has focused on epistemology, [[ethics]] – especially on [[ethical intuitionism]] – and the theory of action. He is O'Brien Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Notre Dame]], and previously held a Chair in the Business School there. His 2005 book, ''The Good in the Right'', updates and strengthens [[W D Ross|Rossian]] intuitionism and develops the [[epistemology]] of ethics. He has also written important works of political philosophy, particularly on the relationship between church and state. He is a past president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]&lt;ref&gt;http://business.nd.edu/RobertAudi/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Society of Christian Philosophers]].

==Life==
Audi earned his BA from [[Colgate University]] and his MA and PhD from the [[University of Michigan]].  He taught initially at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and then for many years as the Charles J. Mach University Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Nebraska|University of Nebraska, Lincoln]] before moving to [[University of Notre Dame]] as Professor of Philosophy, Professor of Management, and the David E. Gallo Chair in Ethics. In 2009 he vacated the Gall Chair and took a chair as John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy. He has served as General Editor of the First Edition (1995) and Second Edition (1999) of ''[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]]''. He has also served as the general editor for "Modern Readings in Epistemology", as well as for "Modern readings in Metaphysics".

In an interview for the [[Brooklyn Friends School]] of which he's an alumnus (year 1959), he revealed that his interest in philosophy came from his father, a businessman and [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] immigrant with an interest in philosophy and history. His mother, a medical doctor and faculty at [[NYU]] Medical School, was also an influence. "'Both liked to explain and comment on things,' Robert mused, 'and they often entertained people from the diplomatic world and medicine who argued about politics, religion and ideas in general.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynfriends.org/RelId/611065/ISvars/default/Alum_Profile%3A_Robert.htm "Alum Profile: Robert Audi '59, by Jeffrey Stanley]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemology==
Audi has defended a position he calls "fallibilistic [[foundationalism]]." He thinks that the foundationalist response is the only tenable option of the [[epistemic regress]] argument. This states that if every belief has to be justified by some other, then the only options are four: infinite regress, circularity, stopping at a belief that isn't knowledge, and stopping at a basic belief that is itself justified. If the only alternative is the fourth, then if one has knowledge, one has foundational knowledge.
Audi considers that foundationalism is usually taken to be infallible. That is, it is normally associated with the view that knowledge is founded on basic beliefs that are axiomatic and [[logical truth|necessarily true]], and that the rest of knowledge is deduced from this set of beliefs. Audi thinks that foundationalism may be fallible, in the sense that the suprastructure of beliefs may be derived inductively from the basic beliefs, and hence may be fallible. He also thinks that basic beliefs need not be necessary truths, but merely have some structure which makes epistemic transition possible. For example, the belief that one is in the presence of an object arises causally from visual perception.

Reference: Audi, "Contemporary Foundationalism".

==Religion in the public square==
In his recent book titled ''The Discourse Theory of Democracy'', Hugh Baxter has commented on "The Rawls/Audi Restrictive View and Its Critics," stating that, "The publication of Rawls's ''Political Liberalism'' in 1993 prompted an extensive debate about the role of religion in politics and particularly about the role of religion in public political discussion among citizens. His views together with those later expressed by Robert Audi, have been taken to define one side of the controversy: the side arguing that citizens in liberal democracies should exercise restraint on public employment of religious reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, Hugh (2011). ''The Discourse Theory of Democracy,'' Sanford University Press, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Baxter stated that the other side of the controversy was represented by the scholars Nicholas Wolterstorff and Paul J. Weithman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2621">'''Salzburg Conference for Young Analytic Philosophy''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Salzburgiense Concilium Omnibus Philosophis Analyticis'', abbreviated ''SOPhiA'') is an annual conference for students and doctoral candidates in philosophy. Since its inception in 2010, the event has been conducted at the Department of Philosophy of the [[University of Salzburg]] in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kriterion.at/home.htm Home] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150614151232/http://www.kriterion.at/home.htm |date=2015-06-14 }} Kriterion&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the talks are held by students and doctoral candidates in philosophy. These are selected by [[double-blind review]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://philevents.org/event/show/17383 SOPhiA 2015] PhilEvents&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, each conference have featured several keynote speakers, notably [[Stephan Hartmann]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://stephanhartmann.org/talks.html Talks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619223123/http://stephanhartmann.org/talks.html |date=2006-06-19 }} stephanhartmann.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Kusch]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://philevents.org/event/show/10346 SOPhiA 2013] PhilEvents&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ulla Wessels]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbg.ac.at/sophia/SOPhiA/2015/languages/en/programme.php Programme] SOPhiA 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The SOPhiA-conferences have no specific theme and are open to all areas of philosophy. Accordingly, there have been talks on a wide range of topics including [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[Logic]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of science]] and [[philosophy of action|philosophical action theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbg.ac.at/sophia/SOPhiA/2015/languages/en/history.php History] SOPhiA&lt;/ref&gt; However, the arrangers state that there is a "methodical limitation to the tradition of [[Analytic Philosophy]] by usage of clear language and comprehensible arguments".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbg.ac.at/sophia/SOPhiA/2015/languages/en/press.php Press] SOPhiA&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning SOPhiA has been sponsored by the philosophy journal ''[[Kriterion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kriterion.at/home.htm Home] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150614151232/http://www.kriterion.at/home.htm |date=2015-06-14 }} Kriterion&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisation that have sponsored the event include the [[German Society for Analytic Philosophy]], the Austrian Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft und Forschung, as well as the [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg state]] and the city of [[Salzburg]].

'''Shelly Kagan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|g|ən}}) is Clark Professor of Philosophy at [[Yale University]], where he has taught since 1995. He is best known for his writings about [[moral philosophy]] and [[normative ethics]].&lt;ref name="yale-page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campuspress.yale.edu/shellykagan/|title=Shelly Kagan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Kagan's course about death was offered for free online, and proved to be very popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yalealumnimagazine.com/blog_posts/1707|title=Live from Brooklyn: Shelly Kagan's "Death"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to him publishing a book on the subject in 2012. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2016.

==Education and career==
A native of [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]], [[Illinois]], Kagan received his B.A. from [[Wesleyan University]] in 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wesconnect.wesleyan.edu/s/1318/index_social.aspx?sid=1318&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2752&amp;cid=4874&amp;ecid=4874&amp;crid=0&amp;calpgid=710&amp;calcid=1764|title=Wesconnect - Wesleyan University Alumni - Kagan ’76 on ‘Why is death bad for you?’|work=Wesconnect - Wesconnect - Wesleyan University Alumni}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his Ph.D. from [[Princeton University]] in 1982. He taught at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] from 1981 until 1986, and at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] from 1986 until 1995, before taking a position at Yale.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v32.n33/story8.html "Shelly Kagan named Clark Professor of Philosophy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418130053/http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v32.n33/story8.html |date=2009-04-18 }}, ''Yale Bulletin and Calendar'', July 23, 2004, Volume 32, Number 33 retrieved November 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==

With the publication of ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'' in 1984, [[Derek Parfit]] credited Kagan in the Acknowledgements as the "person from whom I have learnt the most", citing that Kagan's comments on his draft were half the length of the draft itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parfit |first=Derek |date=1984 |title=Reasons and Persons |publisher=Oxford: Clarendon Press |page=viii |isbn=0-19-824615-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Kagan's first book ''The Limits of Morality'' was published. It is an extended critique of two key assumptions which underlie what Kagan calls "ordinary morality" - the "common‐sense moral view that most of us accept." Specifically, the book questions the assumption that morality rules out certain actions (such as harming innocent people) even in situations where doing so might create greater good, and the assumption that individuals are "not required to make our greatest possible contribution to the overall good."  According to Kagan, these two assumptions are indefensible, despite their widespread appeal.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/0198239165.001.0001|title=The Limits of Morality|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Kagan published a textbook titled ''Normative Ethics,'' designed to provide a thorough introduction to the subject for upper-level undergraduate or graduates students.&lt;ref name="yale.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campuspress.yale.edu/shellykagan/books/|title=Books - Shelly Kagan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 2007, his Yale course "Death" was recorded for [[Open Yale Courses]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-176|title=Open Yale Courses - Death|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501040450/http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-176|archivedate=2017-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the book ''Death'' is based on these lectures.&lt;ref name="yale-page"/&gt; In 2010, Yale University reported Kagan's "Death" course had made him one of the most popular foreign teachers in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kagan’s ‘Death’ class has made him a ‘star’ in China|url=http://news.yale.edu/2010/10/06/kagan-s-death-class-has-made-him-star-china|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kagan also explored the concept of [[desert (philosophy)|desert]], which is a philosophical concept of what individuals do or do not deserve, in his 2012 book ''The Geometry of Desert.''&lt;ref name="yale.edu"/&gt;  According to Kagan, people differ in terms of how morally deserving they are and it is a good thing when people get what they deserve.  The book attempts to reveal the hidden complexity of moral desert.

Kagan has served as a member of the editorial board of the journal ''[[Ethics (journal)|Ethics]]''.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; In 2016, he was made a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.yale.edu/news/prof-shelly-kagan-fellow-american-academy-arts-and-sciences Blog Post] (Yale University Philosophy Department)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shinjin gakudō''''' ({{CJKV|j=身心學道}}), translated into English as '''''Learning the Truth with Body and Mind''''', is a book of the [[Shōbōgenzō]] by the 13th century [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] monk [[Eihei Dōgen]]. It was written in the fall of 1242 at Dōgen's first monastery [[Kōshōhōrin-ji]] in [[Kyoto]]. ''Shinjin gakudō'' appears in both the 75 and 60 fascicle versions of the [[Shōbōgenzō]] as the fourth book, and it is ordered 37th in the later chronological 95 fascicle ''Honzan'' editions. The book explains how truth can be obtained not with the mind alone, but rather with the body and mind together working through action. He further explains that action necessarily requires both the body and mind and that there is thus a oneness in action.&lt;ref name=Gudo&gt;{{Citation| last1 =Nishijima|first1=Gudo|last2=Cross|first2=Chodo|authorlink1=Gudo Nishijima|year = 1994| title = Master Dogen's Shōbōgenzō| volume=2|pages=305–318|publisher = Dogen Sangha| isbn=978-1886439-36-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7299">'''Stefan Zachariasz Pawlicki''' (2 September 1839, Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]) – 28 April 1916, [[Kraków]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[priest]], [[philosopher]], historian of philosophy, professor and rector of [[Kraków]]'s [[Jagiellonian University]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Information from the Polish Wikipedia "Stefan Pawlicki" article, 30 June 2009, 00:34, edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Stefan Pawlicki came from a merchant family. He began his education in Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]); after his family moved to [[Grand Duchy of Posen|Greater Poland]], he continued it in Pleschen ([[Pleszew]]). At age thirteen, he lost his parents during an [[epidemic]].  He completed ''progimnazjum'' thanks to help from a local parish priest, Father Basiński. He continued his education in 1853–58 at a ''liceum'' in [[Ostrów Wielkopolski]], where he was one of the best pupils, thanks to a scholarship from [[Jan Kanty Działyński]] of [[Kórnik]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1858–62 he studied [[classical philology]] at [[Wrocław University|Breslau University]].  At Breslau ([[Wrocław]]) he was secretary and president of the Slavic-Literary Society.  In 1862 he left Breslau without taking a degree. In 1862–64 he was tutor, at [[Rogalin]], to [[Edward Aleksander Raczyński]].  From 1864 he studied in the Philosophy Department at [[Wrocław University]].  At the same time, he attended lectures in [[psychology]] and [[logic]].  In 1865 he defended a [[doctoral thesis]], ''De Schopenhaueri doctrina et philosophandi ratione''—a then pioneering study of the thought of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
 
In 1866 his study of ''[[Eleatics|The Eleatic School]]'' (''Szkoła Eleatów'') won him an [[assistant professor]]ship ''(docentura)'' at [[Warsaw]]'s [[Warsaw University|Main School]].  He lectured there until 1868, in the Philological-Historical Department, on the [[history of philosophy]].  He also conducted open lectures in Warsaw for the [[intelligentsia]]. In 1868 he became an editor of ''Biblioteka Warszawska'', in which he published theatrical and literary reviews.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
  
In Warsaw, influenced by the founder and superior general of the [[Congregation of the Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ]], Father [[Peter Semenenko|Piotr Semenenko]], he underwent a spiritual transformation.  In 1868 he went to [[Rome]] and entered upon a [[Resurrectionist Order|Resurrectionist]] [[novitiate]].  In 1872, in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]], he took [[holy orders]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1869 Pawlicki began studying Christian philosophy and theology at the [[Jesuit]] ''Collegium Romanum''.  In 1873 he defended a doctorate in [[theology]] on ''The Secret of the [[Holy Trinity]]''.  That same year, he became Vice Rector of the Polish College in Rome.  In 1887 he sought a chair in philosophy at [[Kraków]]'s [[Jagiellonian University]], without success.  He remained in Rome and was called by [[Pope Pius IX]] to lecture at the ''Accademia di Religione Cattolica''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
 
In 1882 Pawlicki obtained a professorship in [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]]'s Theology Department.  [[Pope Leo XIII]] heralded his arrival with the [[Latin]] words:  "''Magnum lumen vobis mitto''" ("I send you a great light").&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

At a [[Papal consistory|consistory]] of 10 November 1884, the Pope desired to elevate Father Pawlicki to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]], but Pawlicki declined the honor.&lt;ref&gt;Information on Pawlicki's nomination to be a cardinal, along with a brief biography: [http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1884-ii.htm#Pawlicki The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884 he was elected a correspondent of the Historical-Philosophical Department of the [[Academy of Learning]], and in 1891 its active member. In 1894 he received a second chair, in the [[Jagiellonian University]]'s Philosophical Department.  In 1888–89 and 1892–93 he was dean of the University's Theology Department.  In academic year 1905–06 he was the University's rector.  In 1910 he retired, later lecturing at the University without pay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

From 1911 Pawlicki headed a Commission on the History of Polish Philosophy.  He was a member of the Philosophical Society in Kraków and the [[Polish Philosophical Society]] in [[Lwów]].  Additionally, he belonged to a number of Italian and German scholarly societies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Pawlicki was laid to rest at Kraków's [[Rakowicki Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Pawlicki left his rich book collection to the [[Jagiellonian University]] Library.  He was honored in Kraków with a street named for him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Historian of philosophy [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] writes that Pawlicki was a man of broad culture and philosophical bent, but lacking in real talent for writing or teaching. Under his thirty-plus-year tenure, Kraków philosophy became mainly a historical discipline, out of touch with what was happening in the West or even in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminology and penology |theory}}

In [[sociology]] and [[criminology]], '''strain theory''' states that [[social structure]]s within [[society]] may pressure [[citizen]]s to commit crime. Following on the work of [[Émile Durkheim]], strain theories have been advanced by [[Robert King Merton]] (1938), [[Albert K. Cohen]] (1955), [[Richard Cloward]], [[Lloyd Ohlin]] (1960), [[Neil Smelser]] (1963), [[Robert Agnew (criminologist)|Robert Agnew]] (1992), Steven Messner and [[Richard Rosenfeld]] (1994).

== Strain Theory ==
Strain theory is a sociology and criminology theory developed in 1938 by [[Robert K. Merton]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merton|first1=Robert|title=Social Structure and Anomie|journal=American Sociological Review|date=1938|volume=3|issue=5|pages=672–682|doi=10.2307/2084686}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory states that society puts pressure on individuals to achieve socially accepted goals (such as the American dream), though they lack the means. This leads to strain which may lead the individuals to commit crimes, examples being selling drugs or becoming involved in prostitution, to gain financial security.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Strain may either be:
# Structural: this refers to the processes at the societal level which filter down and affect how the individual perceives his or her needs, i.e. if particular social structures are inherently inadequate or there is inadequate regulation, this may change the individual's perceptions as to means and opportunities; or
# Individual: this refers to the frictions and pains experienced by an individual as he or she looks for ways to satisfy his or her needs, i.e. if the goals of a society become significant to an individual, actually achieving them may become more important than the means adopted.

===Merton's Theory===

[[Robert K. Merton|Robert King Merton]] was an American sociologist who argued that society can encourage deviance to a large degree. Merton believed that socially accepted goals put pressure on people to conform. His theory was largely developed due to the social and economic circumstances occurring in the United States's society during the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://compass.port.ac.uk/UoP/file/7bb5c099-a05e-4037-a4ea-394f0ea4d719/1/Anomie_IMSLRN.zip/page_05.htm|title=Merton's Strain Theory|last=WatkinsM|website=compass.port.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Merton's Strain Theory stems from a fundamental question that he posed on why the rates of deviance were so different among societies. He thought that there could be deviance where there is a difference between what defines success and what the proper means are to achieve these goals. He found the United States as a prime example of high levels of deviance because there is a high value in achieving success, primarily monetary success, but there are contradictions for the means of achieving success. The college educated worker is respected, but the robber barons who stole for their money were also admired, showing success is seen as more important than the means to achieve success. In addition, he also saw how minority groups were unable to get good educations, and if they could then they could not get a good paying job with it, but the same high standard for success is set for everyone even though not everyone could reach those standards through conventional means. These contradictions led him to develop strain theory because of how high the US held success.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.d.umn.edu/~bmork/2306/Theories/BAManomie.htm&lt;/ref&gt; People are forced to work within the system or become members of a deviant subculture to achieve the desired goal. Merton's belief became the theory known as Strain Theory. Merton continued on to say when individuals are faced with a gap between their goals (usually finances/money related) and their current status, strain occurs. When faced with strain, people have five ways to adapt:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Conformity: pursuing cultural goals through socially approved means. ("Hopeful poor")
# Innovation: using socially unapproved or unconventional means to obtain culturally approved goals. Example: dealing drugs or stealing to achieve financial security. ("surviving poor")
# Ritualism: using the same socially approved means to achieve less elusive goals (more modest and humble). ("passive poor")
# Retreatism: to reject both the cultural goals and the means to obtain it, then find a way to escape it. ("retreating poor")
# Rebellion: to reject the cultural goals and means, then work to replace them. ("resisting poor") not accepting any goals and means

==Derived Theories==

===General Strain Theory===
{{main|General strain theory}}

General strain theory (GST) is a sociology and criminology theory developed in 1992 by [[Robert Agnew (criminologist)|Robert Agnew]]. Agnew believed that Merton's theory was too vague in nature and did not account for criminal activity which did not involve financial gain. The core idea of general strain theory is that people who experience strain or stress become distressed or upset which may lead them to commit crime in order to cope. One of the key principle of this theory is emotion as the motivator for crime. The theory was developed to conceptualize the full range of sources in society where strain possibly comes from, which Merton's strain theory does not. The theory also focuses on the perspective of goals for status, expectations and class rather than focusing on money (as Merton's theory does). Examples of General Strain Theory are people who use illegal drugs to make themselves feel better, or a student assaulting his peers to end the harassment they caused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agnew|first1=Robert|title=Building on the Foundation of General Strain Theory: Specifying the Types of Strain Most Likely to Lead to Crime and Delinquency|journal=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency|date=2001|volume=38|issue=4|pages=319–361|doi=10.1177/0022427801038004001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agnew|first1=Robert|title=General Strain Theory|journal= Encyclopedia of Criminology and Criminal Justice|date=2014|pages=1892–1900|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-5690-2_218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agnew|first1=Robert|title=General Strain Theory and Delinquency|journal=The Handbook of Juvenile Delinquency and Juvenile Justice Krohn/The Handbook of Juvenile Delinquency and Juvenile Justice|date=2015|pages=237–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GST introduces 3 main sources of strain such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paternoster|first1=Raymond|last2=Mazerolle|first2=Paul|title=General Strain Theory and Delinquency: A Replication and Extension|journal=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency|date=1994|volume=31|issue=3|pages=235–263|doi=10.1177/0022427894031003001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Loss of positive stimuli (death of family or friend)
# Presentation of negative stimuli (physical and verbal assaults)
# The inability to reach a desired goal.

===Institutional Anomie Theory===
Institutional anomie theory (IAT) is a criminology theory developed in 1994 in by Steven Messner and [[Richard Rosenfeld]]. The theory proposes that an institutional arrangement with a market, where the market/economy is allowed to operate/dominate without restraints from other social intuitions like family will likely cause criminal behavior. Derived from Merton's Strain Theory, IAT expands on the macro levels of the theory. IAT's focus centers on the criminal influences of varied social institutions, rather than just the economic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Messner|first1=Steven|last2=Rosenfeld|first2=Richard|title=Crime and the American Dream|date=1997|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|location=Belmont, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savolainen|first1=Jukka|title=Institutional Anomie Theory|journal=Oxford Bibliographies Online Datasets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illegitimate Opportunities Theory===
{{Main|Illegitimate opportunity}}

Illegitimate opportunities is a sociology theory developed in 1960 by [[Richard Cloward]] and [[Lloyd Ohlin]]. The theory states that crimes result from a high number of illegitimate opportunities and not from a lack of legitimate ones. The theory was created from Merton's strain theory to help address juvenile delinquency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Delinquency and opportunity: a theory of delinquent gangs|last=Cloward|first=Richard|last2=Ohlin|first2=Lloyd|publisher=Free Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=Glencoe, IL|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role Strain Theory ===

The theory of "role strain", developed by sociologist William J. Goode in 1960, states that social institutions are supported and operated by role relationships. Due to these role relationships that individuals may feel "role strain", or difficulty fulfilling their sociological duties in the relationship. It is through this "role strain" that social action and social structure are maintained.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goode|first=William J.|date=1960|title=A Theory of Role Strain|jstor=2092933|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=25|issue=4|pages=483–496|doi=10.2307/2092933}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these relationships, come social obligations that members of that society are required to follow, which people are usually not forced to fulfill. In order for the society to continue existing, these obligations must be fulfilled at the volition of the individuals in it, which the theory states is what most people are inclined to do.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Due to the fact that there is no force involved in maintaining these role relationships, there will be individuals who can not, or will not, conform to these societal expectations.

In addition, the individuals within the society are not bound to one role relationship. In fact, all individuals will be part of multiple role relationships.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Possession of multiple relationships can account for the conflicts of interest often faced in social settings. According to Goode, however, due to these multiple relationships, an individual will almost always have a total amount of role obligations that demand more than what the individual can give,&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; whether it is in terms of time, emotional favor, or material resources. This can give rise to "role strain", which can lead the individual to attempting to fulfill socially acceptable goals in means that may not be socially acceptable (as explained in General Strain Theory).

While the theory of role strain attempts to attribute the maintenance of society to role relationships, Goode also acknowledges that the theory does not account for the existence of more complex social settings, such as that of urban society. The theory of role strain does not account for several aspects of urban life, such as the fact that some individuals accept absolutely none of the society's central values, the fact that individuals vary in their emotional commitment to these societal values, how these role relationships change when individuals go through a change in social position, or how these relationships hold up during times of crisis.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Other Strain Theorists ==

===Robert Agnew===
In 1992, [[Robert Agnew (criminologist)|Robert Agnew]] asserted that strain theory could be central in explaining crime and deviance, but that it needed revision so that it was not tied to social class or cultural variables, but re-focused on norms.  To this end, Agnew proposed a general strain theory that is neither structural nor interpersonal but rather individual and emotional, paying special attention to an individual's immediate social environment. He argued that an individual's actual or anticipated failure to achieve positively valued goals, actual or anticipated removal of positively valued stimuli, and actual or anticipated presentation of negative stimuli all result in strain.

Anger and frustration confirm negative relationships.  The resulting behavior patterns will often be characterized by more than their share of unilateral action because an individual will have a natural desire to avoid unpleasant rejections, and these unilateral actions (especially when antisocial) will [[Feedback loop|further contribute]] to an individual's alienation from society.  If particular rejections are generalized into feelings that the environment is unsupportive,more strongly negative emotions may motivate the individual to engage in crime.  This is most likely to be true for younger individuals, and Agnew suggested that research focus on the magnitude, recency, duration, and clustering of such strain-related events to determine whether a person copes with strain in a criminal or conforming manner.  Temperament, intelligence, interpersonal skills, self-efficacy, the presence of conventional social support, and the absence of association with antisocial (''e.g.'', criminally inclined) age and status peers are chief among the factors Agnew identified as beneficial.

=== Jie Zhang ===

The strain theory of suicide postulates that suicide is usually preceded by psychological strains. A psychological strain is formed by at least two stresses or pressures, pushing the individual to different directions. A strain can be a consequence of any of the four conflicts: differential values, discrepancy between aspiration and reality, relative deprivation, and lack of coping skills for a crisis. Psychological strains in the form of all the four sources have been tested and supported with a sample of suicide notes in the United States and in rural China through psychological autopsy studies. The strain theory of suicide forms a challenge to the psychiatric model popular among the suicidologists in the world.&lt;br /&gt;
The strain theory of suicide is based on the theoretical frameworks established by previous sociologists, e.g. Durkheim (1951), Merton (1957), and Agnew (2006), and preliminary tests have been accomplished with some American (Zhang and Lester 2008) and Chinese data (Zhang 2010; Zhang, Dong, Delprino, and Zhou 2009; Zhang, Wieczorek, Conwell, and Tu 2011).&lt;br /&gt;
There could be four types of strain that precede a suicide, and each can be derived from specific sources. A source of strain must consist of two, and at least two, conflicting social facts. If the two social facts are non-contradictory, there would be no strain.
* '''Strain Source 1: Differential Values'''
When two conflicting social values or beliefs are competing in an individual’s daily life, the person experiences value strain. The two conflicting social facts are competing personal beliefs internalized in the person’s value system. A cult member may experience strain if the mainstream culture and the cult religion are both considered important in the cult member’s daily life. Other examples include the second generation of immigrants in the United States who have to abide by the ethnic culture rules enforced in the family while simultaneously adapting to the American culture with peers and school. In China, rural young women appreciate gender egalitarianism advocated by the communist government, but at the same time, they are trapped in cultural sexual discrimination as traditionally cultivated by Confucianism. Another example that might be found in developing countries is the differential values of traditional collectivism and modern individualism. When the two conflicting values are taken as equally important in a person’s daily life, the person experiences great strain. When one value is more important than the other, there is then little or no strain.

== Criticism ==
Strain theory has received several criticisms, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernard|first1=T.J.|title=Control Criticisms of Strain Theories: An Assessment of Theoretical and Empirical Adequacy|journal=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency|date=1984|volume=21|issue=4|pages=353–372|doi=10.1177/0022427884021004005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kornhauser|first1=Ruth|title=Social sources of delinquency: an appraisal of analytic models|date=1978|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Strain theory best applies only to the lower class as they struggle with limited resources to obtain their goals.
# Strain theory fails to explain white collar crime, the perpetrator of whom have many opportunities to achieve through legal and legitimate means.
# Strain theory fails to explain crimes based in gender inequality.
# Merton deals with individuals forms of responses instead of group activity which crime involves.
# Merton's theory is not very critical of the social structure that he says generate the strains.
# Strain theory neglects the inter- and intra-personal aspect of crime.
# Strain theory has weak empirical evidence supporting it.

==Studies==
Strain theory was tested following its development. Most of these test examined ideal goals such as occupational goals and individual expectations, which would most ideally lead to crimes if not achieved under rule of strain theory. However, most of the research found that this was not the case. An example of these studies was a study done by [[Travis Hirschi]] in the 1969. He analyzes a large body of data on delinquency collected in Western Contra Costa County, California that contrast with strain theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Causes of Delinquency|last=Hirschi|first=Travis|publisher=University of California|year=1969|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results and other criticisms lead to the abandonment of strain theory around the 1970s to the 80s.

In addition to the study done by Hirsch, strain theory was explored in a 2001 study conducted by Jason D. Boardman (and others). The study explored how societal strain and stress can lead to drug use by individuals, in particular how one's neighborhood environment can affect their susceptibility to drug abuse. This study specifically centered around troubled neighborhoods in Detroit, and the results were based on census data taken of these neighborhoods, mainly because this data contained information on each individual resident's use of drugs. From this data, the study found that the more disadvantaged a neighborhood is, the more its residents abuse drugs.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boardman|first=Jason D.|last2=Finch|first2=Brian Karl|last3=Ellison|first3=Christopher G.|last4=Williams|first4=David R.|last5=Jackson|first5=James S.|date=2001|title=Neighborhood Disadvantage, Stress, and Drug Use among Adults|jstor=3090175|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=42|issue=2|pages=151–165|doi=10.2307/3090175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study credited this positive trend to higher levels of stress and fewer available resources. According to strain theory, this lack of resources may compel an individual to abuse drugs to attain the positively valued goal of happiness by using the means that are currently available,&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; which in the case of rough neighborhoods, were drugs.

'''''Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About''''' (2001) is a book by [[Donald E. Knuth]], published by CSLI Publications of Stanford, California. The book contains the annotated transcripts of six public lectures given by [[Donald E. Knuth]] at [[MIT]] on the subject of relations between [[religion]] and [[science]] (particularly [[computer science]]).&lt;ref name=website/&gt;  Knuth gives credence to the concept of divinity.

==Contents==
[[Anne Foerst]] wrote a [[foreword]] for the book. The six chapters are lightly edited transcriptions of Knuth's lectures:
* Lecture 1: Introduction
* Lecture 2: Randomization and Religion
* Lecture 3: Language Translation
* Lecture 4: Aesthetics
* Lecture 5: Glimpses of God
* Lecture 6: God and Computer Science'''

Knuth added a final section entitled "Panel: Creativity, Spirituality, and Computer Science".

==Excerpts from reviews==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One mark of a good author is the ability to make a successful book out of an unpromising subject.  Over the years, Donald E. Knuth has produced a slew of bestsellers on topics that might seem to have only limited appeal, most notably the arts of computer programming and mathematical typography.  His latest book takes on a subject so challenging it has to hide behind a coy title: '''''Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About''''' (CSLI Publications, $35). What is this subject that dare not speak its name? Not sex, but religion.  The book is based on a series of lectures on "interactions between faith and computer science." The main topic is Knuth's approach to Bible study through random sampling (which led to an earlier book as well, titled '''''3:16'''''); there is also musing on the programmer's role as god of a created universe. It's a very unpromising subject, but Knuth is a very good author.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Scientist]], Volume 90, 2002 May–June, p. 270–271&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If you are a fan of '''''3:16''''' and want to know more about the statistical techniques Knuth employed, his aesthetic considerations, how he translated the 59 verses without knowing Hebrew or Greek, or what he learned in the process of this project—or if you simply want merely to spend time with a remarkable, playful intellect—you'll enjoy this book. If you want to know how computer science might help theological reflection, lecture six can launch you on your way to further, challenging study.&lt;ref&gt;Mark U. Edwards Jr. ([[St. Olaf College]]) '''[[Christian Century]]''', August 28-September 10, 2002, p. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Despite many enjoyable passages, the book ultimately disappoints.  While I can imagine that the lectures might have been wonderful to listen to, their verbatim transcription to the printed page does not always work well. A large fraction of the lectures centered around Knuth's study of selected verses from the Bible, but the written version comes across as repetitious, with many uninteresting details. Knuth's analysis of the verses is not deep and not particularly informed by a scientific sensibility.  And too many of the questions in the question-and-answer sessions were superficial and could have been edited.&lt;ref&gt;[[Saul Teukolsky|Saul A. Teukolsky]] ([[Cornell University]]) '''[[Physics Today]]''', April 2002, p. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Berkeley.jpg|thumb|right|upright|George Berkeley]]
'''''Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous''''', or simply '''''Three Dialogues''''', is a 1713 book on [[metaphysics]] and [[idealism]] written by [[George Berkeley]]. Taking the form of a dialogue, the book was written as a response to the criticism Berkeley experienced after publishing ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]''.&lt;ref name="Turbayne"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Turbayne| first=C. M.| authorlink=Colin Murray Turbayne| title=Berkeley's Two Concepts of Mind| journal=[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]| volume=20| issue=1|  date=September 1959| pages=85–92| jstor=2104957| doi=10.2307/2104957}} &lt;br /&gt; Repr. in {{cite book| last1=Engle| first1=Gale| last2=Taylor| first2=Gabriele| title=Berkeley's Principles of Human Knowledge: Critical Studies| location=Belmont, CA| publisher=Wadsworth| year=1968| pages=24–33}} In this collection of essays, Turbayne's work comprised two papers that had been published in [[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]:
* "Berkeley's Two Concepts of Mind"
* C. Turbayne's reply to [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2105263 S.A. Grave "A Note on Berkeley's Conception of the Mind"] ([[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]], 1962, vol. 22, No. 4).
&lt;/ref&gt;

Three important concepts discussed in the ''Three Dialogues'' are [[perception|perceptual]] relativity, the conceivability/[[master argument]]{{efn|"master argument" was coined by André Gallois&lt;ref&gt;A. Gallois, [http://su-ltd.mylivepage.ru/file/2716/6135_Gallois_on_Berkeley.djvu "Berkeley's Master Argument."] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714063318/http://su-ltd.mylivepage.ru/file/2716/6135_Gallois_on_Berkeley.djvu |date=2012-07-14 }} ''The Philosophical Review'' 83 (1974), pp. 55-69&lt;/ref&gt;}} and Berkeley's [[phenomenalism]]. Perceptual relativity argues that the same object can appear to have different characteristics (e.g. shape) depending on the observer's [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]]. Since objective features of objects cannot change without an inherent change in the object itself, shape must not be an objective feature.

==Background==

In 1709, Berkeley published his first major work, ''[[s:An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision|An Essay towards a New Theory of Vision]]'', in which he discussed the limitations of human vision and advanced the theory that the proper objects of sight are not material objects, but light and colour.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last=Berkeley |first=George |year=1709 |contribution= |title= An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision |edition= 2 |publisher=Jeremy Pepyat  |publication-date=1709 |publication-place=Dublin  |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1o85AAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AdyOzLl2K0NEC&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |accessdate=12 July 2014 }} via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; This foreshadowed his chief philosophical work, ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (1710), which, after its poor reception, he rewrote into the ''Three Dialogues'' (1713).&lt;ref name="Turbayne"/&gt;

==Hylas and Philonous==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
Berkeley's views are represented by Philonous (Greek: "lover of mind"), while [[Hylas]] (Greek: "matter") embodies the Irish thinker's opponents, in particular [[John Locke]].

In The First Dialogue, Hylas expresses his disdain for [[skepticism]], adding that he has heard Philonous to have "maintained the most extravagant opinion... namely, that there is no such thing as ''material substance'' in the world."  Philonous argues that it is actually Hylas who is the skeptic and that he can prove it. Thus, a philosophical battle of wit begins.

Philonous questions Hylas systematically regarding what humans know of the world, first examining secondary qualities, such as heat, to show that such qualities do not exist outside the individual mind. He then moves on to primary qualities such as extension and shape, and likewise argues that they, too, are dependent entirely on one's [[perception]] (e.g., From a distance, a great mountain appears to be small, and the shape of a thing may change dramatically under a microscope).

Hylas's view of matter (which has its origin in the Platonic theory of forms [http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2f.htm], or abstract entities that exist outside of the sensible world){{citation needed|date=October 2013}} is systematically destroyed by Philonous (Berkeley).  The basic argument is that because matter is only known to us by its sensible qualities, it is impossible to describe or even imagine matter without these qualities.  For in the absence of sensible qualities, matter, by definition, loses its essential qualities.

Berkeley's argument goes further: sensible qualities are not inherent in matter. Rather, they are ascribed and understood by the mind.  Color, sound, temperature and even shape are qualities entirely dependent on a mind.  Indeed, without a "mind," it becomes impossible to imagine "matter."  The answer to the question, "If a tree falls in the forest and no mind is present, does it make a noise?" is answered by Berkeley's immaterialism: There is no tree.  However, God is always perceiving everything.  In other words, there is ''always'' a mind present.  A human (and thus a human mind) need not be present for the tree to make a sound, for the mind of God is always present, or so Berkeley argues.  It is this mind of God that gives sensible qualities to matter, not matter itself.

In his own time Berkeley faced opposition from many philosophers who held to the Platonic view.  These philosophers thought Berkeley vulgar because his own view seemed to confirm the views held by the lower classes.  Roughly speaking, the "common view" was that God created everything and that the things on earth were the real things.  Some philosophers did not believe in God, and believed matter on earth was but an imitation of actual matter that existed in another dimension.  Berkeley sided with the common view.

The philosophy presented is often misinterpreted.  The criticism is that Berkeley claims that we live in an illusory world, when in fact, Berkeley advocates for the acceptance of ideas as real "things."  When we refer to an object, we don't refer to a material form, but to the idea of the object that informs our senses.  Berkeley doesn't propose that ''nothing'' is real; he proposes that ''ideas themselves'' compose reality.
