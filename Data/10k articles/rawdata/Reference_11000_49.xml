[[William Yarrell]]'s '''''A History of British Birds''''' was first published as a whole in three volumes in 1843, having been serialized, three sheets every two months, over the previous six years. It is not a history of ornithology but a [[natural history]], a handbook or field guide systematically describing every species of bird known to occur in Britain. A separate article of about six pages, containing an image, a description, and an account of worldwide distribution, together with reports of behaviour, is provided for each species.

It quickly became the standard reference work for a generation of British [[ornithologist]]s, replacing [[Thomas Bewick]]'s [[History of British Birds|book of the same name]] through its increased scientific accuracy, but following Bewick in its mixture of scientific data, accurate illustrations, detailed descriptions and varied anecdotes, as well as in the use of small 'tail-piece' engravings at the ends of articles. This  made the book attractive to the public as well as to specialists. Yarrell, a newsagent without university education, corresponded widely with eminent naturalists including [[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Coenraad Jacob Temminck]] and [[Thomas Pennant]] to collect accurate information on the hundreds of species illustrated in the work.

The book is illustrated with over 500 drawings directly onto wood blocks, mostly by [[Alexander Fussell]]. These were then engraved by [[John Thompson (engraver)|John Thompson]]. Publication was initially in 37 parts of three large folded sheets each; these were then collected and bound into volumes. Most of the copies were on [[octavo]] paper; some "large paper" format copies were printed in the larger royal octavo with just 50 copies in the very large imperial octavo format. Four editions were produced between 1843 and 1885.

==Approach==

Yarrell was aware of earlier bird handbooks, especially [[Thomas Bewick|Bewick's]]. ''A History of British Birds'' used the same title as Bewick's popular book (1797–1804).&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/historyofbritish01bewi | title=A history of British birds (1885) | publisher=Ebook and Texts Archive | work=Attribution | accessdate=January 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its approach, however, was significantly different in the extensiveness of Yarrell's correspondence and in the increased emphasis on scientific accuracy made possible by the rapid advance in ornithological knowledge in the nineteenth century.

===Correspondence and specimens===
[[File:William Yarrell (1784-1856).jpg|thumb|[[William Yarrell]] (1784–1856), an uneducated bookseller, was admired for his scientific work.]]

Yarrell corresponded widely, consulted existing handbooks of birds, and made use of his membership of the [[Zoological Society of London]] and the [[Linnean Society]] to find out about recent discoveries.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|vol=63|page=286|wstitle=Yarrell, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; He referenced the work of, amongst others, the [[Ornithology|ornithologists]] [[William Macgillivray]], [[John James Audubon]], [[George Montagu (naturalist)|George Montagu]], [[Prideaux John Selby]], [[Leonard Jenyns]], [[John Gould]], [[Temminck]], [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Heinrich von Kittlitz]]. During the six years of writing, with the regular publication of three-sheet instalments of his ''Birds'', many people across Britain and Europe sent him descriptions, observations and specimens for him to include, and the book is full of references to such contributions. Yarrell explicitly states in his Preface that

{{quote|During these six years many occurrences of rare birds, and of some that were even new to Britain, became known to me, either by the communications of private friends and correspondents, or from the examination of the various periodical works which give publicity to such events.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Yarrell, 1843. Preface, page v.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In some cases, Yarrell's correspondents and reference books enable him to add an account of a bird's distribution around the world. For the [[ringed plover]], for example, [[Sven Nilsson]] speaks for Sweden and the Baltic coast; Mr Hewitson for Norway; [[Carl Linnaeus]] for Lapland; a Mr Scoresby for Iceland and Greenland; the zoologist [[Thomas Pennant]] for Russia and Siberia; the archaeologist [[Charles Fellows]]{{efn|Yarrell writes "Mr. Fellowes". Charles Fellows's ''A Journal written during an Excursion in Asia Minor'' was published in 1839.}} for Asia Minor [Turkey], and [[Coenraad Jacob Temminck]] for Japan.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Yarrell, 1843. Volume 2. pp.&amp;nbsp;402–403.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the [[wood sandpiper]], Dr. Calvert sent a specimen from Malta; Selby and Dr. Andrew Smith, specimens from South Africa; others from India; Gould "mentions having seen skins" from "Chili and the Islands of the Pacific".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Yarrell, 1843. Volume 2. p. 537.&lt;/ref&gt; Yarrell also describes his own observations, in this case with the words "It [the wood sandpiper] is far from being numerous in the localities where I met with it... Although I met with the young in a downy state, and partially feathered, I only obtained one nest with eggs."&lt;ref group=P&gt;Yarrell, 1843. Volume 2. p. 536.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
[[File:Egyptian Vulture in Yarrell's British Birds 1843.jpg|thumb|[[Egyptian vulture]], complete with laden [[camel]]s, [[pyramid]] and desert landscape, but also an accurate list of scientific names and authorities]]

Yarrell broadly follows the lead of Bewick in describing each species in a separate section, with essentially no introduction. The first bird, the [[Egyptian vulture]], is preceded by nothing more than the Index (there is no table of contents) and the heading "British Birds", though there is an introductory paragraph on page 2, inside the Egyptian vulture article. Like Bewick, Yarrell's sections begin with a large wood engraving, depicting the species against a more or less realistic background: that of the Egyptian vulture shows a pyramid and a pair of laden camels. An immediate difference from Bewick is the list of Latin names that follows, with ''Vultur percnopterus'' (Bewick), ''Neophron  percnopterus'' (Selby, Jenyns, Eyton, and Gould), and ''Cathartes  percnopterus'' (Temminck). This care reflects both the rapidly advancing state of ornithology in the early nineteenth century, and Yarrell's more scientific approach.&lt;ref name=Farber&gt;{{cite book |last=Farber |first=Paul L. |year=1982|title=The Emergence of Ornithology as a Scientific Discipline, 1760–1850|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company, Boston|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The account of the first species of each genus, such as the vulture genus ''Neophron'', includes a paragraph on "Generic Characters", describing the beak, legs, wings and any distinguishing features useful for identification. These features are often small, requiring examination or measurement of specimens in the hand, reflecting the fact, repeated many times in the book, that those interested in birds shot them to collect unusual specimens. The Egyptian vulture was recorded from a specimen in [[Somerset]], England, "now in the possession of the Rev. A. Mathew,{{efn|This appears to be the Rev. John Matthew, 30 December 1761 – 10 March 1837, Rector of Kilve with Stringston, Somerset from 1797 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/j/o/w/Peter-F-Jowers/GENE2-0009.html Ancestors of Peter Francis Jowers]. Retrieved 25 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;}} of Kilve in Somersetshire, [which] was shot near that place in October 1825." The bird was one of a pair, but the other was too wary to be captured.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Yarrell, 1843. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Yarrell then proceeds to describe where the bird can be found, its behaviour and diet, and its detailed appearance. The Egyptian vulture takes up six pages, which is typical; the golden eagle gets eight pages, the hobby only four.

Also like Bewick, many articles end with a tail-piece, a small engraving, but here again Yarrell shows himself to be both more serious and less merely decorative than Bewick, with more information to impart. The Egyptian vulture article ends with a large and accurate engraving of another specimen, so the article shows both a young and an old bird, with clearly different plumage which is also described in the text.

===Descriptions===

As well as straightforward details of each bird, Yarrell adds many stories, chosen from his own experience, from his correspondents, or from often recently published accounts, to enliven the description of each species according to his taste.

For example, the "[[Fulmar|Fulmar Petrel]]" quotes John Macgillivray's article "in a recent number of the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal", describing a visit to [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]] in June 1840, for a page and a half. It begins:

{{quote|This bird exists here in almost incredible numbers, and to the natives is by far the most important of the productions of the island&amp;nbsp;... [They] daily risk their lives in its pursuit. The Fulmar breeds on the face of the highest precipices, and only on such as are furnished with small grassy shelves, every spot on which, above a few inches in extent, is occupied with one or more of its nests&amp;nbsp;... The young birds were very clamorous on being handled, and vomited a quantity of clear oil&amp;nbsp;... which imparts to the whole bird, its nest and young, and even to the rock which it frequents, a peculiar and very disagreeable odour. Fulmar oil is among the most valuable productions of St Kilda. The best is obtained from the old bird. The Fulmar flies with great buoyancy and considerable rapidity, and when at sea is generally seen skimming along the surface of the waves at a slight elevation&amp;nbsp;... |Yarrell, "The Fulmar Petrel".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Yarrell, 1843. Volume 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;498–499, citing [[John Macgillivray]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Macgillivray is similarly relied upon for accounts of the [[pink-footed goose]] and the [[goosander]] as far as the [[Hebrides]] are concerned.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Yarrell, 1843. Volume 3, pp 67, 293-294.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with Bewick, Yarrell is unsentimental about hunting. Landrails or [[corncrake]]s "are considered most delicate as articles of food, and in such high estimation, that two Landrails are said to be a present for a queen." But he constantly provides accurate stories that inform and entertain the reader:

{{quote|Mr Jesse .. says:— A gentleman had a Corn Crake brought to him by his dog, to all appearance quite dead. As it lay on the ground, he turned it over with his foot, and was convinced it was dead. Standing by, however, in silence, he suddenly saw it open an eye. He then took it up; its head fell; its legs hung loose, and it [[Apparent death|appeared again quite dead]]. He then put it in his pocket, and before long he felt it all alive, and struggling to escape. He then took it out; it was as lifeless as before. Having laid it again upon the ground and retired to some distance, the bird in about five minutes warily raised its head, looked round, and decamped at full speed.|Yarrell, "The Landrail".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Yarrell, 1843. Volume 3, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Observations==

[[File:Crossbill skull and jaw anatomy from Yarrell History of British Birds 1843 (detail).jpg|thumb|Figures of [[crossbill]] (''[[Loxia curvirostra]]'') skull and jaw anatomy]]

In addition to the work of collating descriptions and commissioning drawings and engravings, Yarrell also made his own scientific observations of certain topics, including the description of the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] of several species, and a detailed account, occupying seven pages, of the skull, jaw, musculature, and feeding behaviour of the common crossbill, ''[[Loxia curvirostra]]''. The article for the crossbill is one of the longest in the book, at 20 pages. Yarrell introduces his special interest in this bird's head as follows:

{{quote|The peculiar formation and direction of the parts of the beak in the Crossbill, its anomalous appearance, as well as the particular and powerful manner in which it is exercised, had long excited in me a desire to examine the structure of an organ so curious, and the kindness of a friend supplied me with the means.|Yarrell, "The Common Crossbill".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Yarrell, 1843. Volume 2, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yarrell at once goes on to explain that the crossbills are unique in making use of "any lateral motion of the mandibles, and it is my object here to describe the bony structure and muscles by which this peculiar and powerful action is obtained." He explains the anatomy and how the jaws are closed, and then how their unique side-to-side motion is achieved:

{{quote|When the lateral motion is required, the great pyramidal muscle on the right side pulls the extremity of the lower jaw, to which it is attached backwards; the pterygoid muscle of the left side at the same time powerfully assisting by carrying that side of the lower jaw inwards.|Yarrell, "The Common Crossbill".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Yarrell, 1843. Volume 2, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He then quotes a Mr. Townson's account of how crossbills feed on pine cones, inserting their beaks between the scales and then forcing them sideways, opening the cone. Yarrell then immediately returns to anatomy, describing in detail (nearly a page) how the tongue is used to extract the seed from between the cone scales. Only then does he return to Mr. Townson, quoting him as saying "The degree of the lateral power is surprising, and they are fond of exercising it for amusement; they are, therefore, not a little mischievous. My pets would often come to my table whilst I was writing, and carry off my pencils&amp;nbsp;... and tear them to pieces in a minute." Yarrell then adds an observation of his own, and contradicts an opinion of a famous scientist: "Notwithstanding [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]'s assertion to the contrary, they can pick up and eat the smallest seeds&amp;nbsp;... so perfect and useful is this singular instrument." He goes on to criticise Buffon's description of the crossbill's beak as "an error and defect of Nature, and a useless deformity" as "an erroneous and hasty conclusion". Yarrell concludes by writing "I have never met with a more interesting, or more beautiful example, of the [[adaptation (biology)|adaptation]] of means to an end, than is to be found in the beak, the tongue, and their muscles, in the Crossbill".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Yarrell, 1843. Volume 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;30–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Fussell]] created most of the drawings for the book. Yarrell thanks Fussell in his Preface for "nearly five hundred of the drawings on wood here employed", and [[John Thompson (engraver)|John Thompson]] (1785–1866) and his sons{{efn|Yarrell may well be referring here to John Thompson's elder son Charles Thurston Thompson, and his younger brother Charles Thompson, both of whom were skilled engravers. John's other son Richard does not appear to have been an engraver.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900, Volume 56. {{ws|Thompson, John (1785–1866)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} for the "very long series of [[wood engraving|engravings]]" of the drawings. He also thanks his printers, Messrs. Bentley, Wilson and Fley for their care and skill. The pen for the remaining drawings, if any (the title page asserts there are 520 in the book), is not stated.&lt;ref group=P name=BirdsPreface/&gt; As well as the figures of birds, there are 59 tail-pieces (following Bewick, small woodcuts to fill in the spaces at ends of articles), of which some are whimsical, like Bewick's, but many illustrate anatomical details, especially breastbones and windpipes, and others, although decorative, realistically depict aspects of bird behaviour or human interaction with birds.&lt;ref name=Amherst&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amherst.edu/library/archives/holdings/soffer/y |last=Soffer |first=Richard | title=Yarrell, William (1784–1856).

Soffer Ornithology Collection Notes | accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the tail-piece for the "Jack Snipe" shows a bittern among reeds, swallowing a frog, while that for the "Common Bittern" shows "a mode of shooting an Eagle from a pit".

Fussell's work began in 1837 and continued for six years. Many of the drawings were from skins or stuffed specimens, though every bird species is illustrated with a lifelike drawing of the bird standing (or rarely, flying or swimming) in a natural setting. Additional drawings depict nests, feathers, and details of bird anatomy including feet, breastbones, and windpipes. Simon Holloway suggests that Fussell and the engravers Charles Thompson and sons probably made all the illustrations for the first three editions of Yarrell's ''Birds''.

==Reception==

Contemporaries enjoyed Yarrell's ''Birds'', which sold well through various editions. In ''The Birds of Shakespeare'' (1871), [[James Edmund Harting]] notes that "an excellent dissertation on the organ of voice in the raven will be found in the second volume of Yarrell's 'British Birds'",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harting |first=James Edmund |authorlink=James Edmund Harting | title=The Birds of Shakespeare. Critically examined, explained, and illustrated. | publisher=[[John Van Voorst]] | year=1871 | location=London | pages=Chapter 4: The Crows and their Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Harting refers to Yarrell when he needs ornithological facts.

Thomas R Forbes, in his biographical paper on Yarrell, writes that "All [editions of ''Birds''] are outstanding because of the author's clear, narrative style, accuracy, careful scholarship, and unassuming charm."&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite journal |last=Forbes |first=Thomas R. | jstor=985256 | title=William Yarrell, British Naturalist | journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]] |date=December 1962 | volume=106 | issue=6 | pages=505–515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Holloway, in his ''Historical Atlas of Breeding Birds in Britain and Ireland 1875–1900'', writes that Yarrell's ''Birds'' was "far more thoroughly dealt with than in Bewick's work and, once again, was liberally illustrated with wood-engravings". He adds that the book was "also hugely influential in its day", being "reasonably cheap", and that it was the book that the future authors of "the county avifaunas were bought as children and remained their standard textbook", i.e. that Yarrell influenced a whole generation of ornithological authors in Britain. Holloway used Yarrell's figures to accompany the account of each species of bird in his ''Historical Atlas''.&lt;ref name=Holloway/&gt;

[[File:Bee-Eater from Yarrell History of British Birds 1843.jpg|thumb|"The Bee-Eater". Drawn and engraved by John Thompson. Yarrell's plates, unlike those of many other books, were never hand-coloured, so the [[European bee-eater]]'s [[animal coloration|glowing coloration]] was described in words.]]
[[File:Şahlûr crop.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Yarrell described the bee-eater's colours with words like reddish brown, saffron yellow, greenish blue, bluish green, duck green and verdigris green. (Vol. II, page 204)]]

The Soffer Ornithology Collection at [[Amherst College]] observes that "Yarrell's History was the standard illustrated British bird book of the 19th century and one of the historically great ornithological works. In well chosen prose, Yarrell provides synonymy, generic characters, a description with measurements, local and general distribution and a life history including [[nidification]] and eggs and arrival and departure times for each species. The wood engraved text figures have never been surpassed using this technique in terms of accuracy and artistic merit." Soffer suggests that the "fourth edition is perhaps the best, embellished as it is by contributions from [[Alfred Newton]] and [[Howard Saunders]]".&lt;ref name=Amherst/&gt;

In ''Ornithology in Scotland'', Yarrell's ''Birds'' is described as "written by an Englishman and illustrated in a manner calculated to attract the non-scientific ornithologist right at the opening of the era of the great Victorian naturalists". It eclipsed the unfortunate MacGillivray, whose ''British Birds'' in contrast "never achieved real popularity", partly because it was illustrated strictly technically, and partly because it appeared at the same time as the first part of Yarrell's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pennie |first=Ian D | title=Ornithology in Scotland. A historical review | journal=Scottish Birds: The Journal of the [[Scottish Ornithologists' Club]] |date=Summer 1966 | volume=4 | issue=2 | pages=126–141 |url=http://www.the-soc.org.uk/docs/scottish-birds/sb-vol04-no02.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bookseller Isabelline Books argues that "Yarrell’s History [of British Birds]  probably contains the richest collection of colour descriptions in any bird book in the English language",&lt;ref name=Isabelline&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibooknet.co.uk/archive/news_april04.htm#Feature | title=News from the Independent Booksellers' Network | publisher=Independent Booksellers' Network | work=Colour Prejudice and William Yarrell | date=April 2004 | accessdate=24 May 2014 | author=Isabelline Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; with "various parts of the [[Bee-eater|Bee-Eater]] described as verditer blue, saffron-yellow, chestnut, duck-green, verdigris-green, buff, greyish-brown and fawn colour. The [[Roller]] as berlin-blue, brownish-yellow, coppery-purple and light cinnamon. The [[Clanga (genus)|Spotted Eagle]] as chocolate-brown, pale wood-brown and reddish liver-brown. The [[Eurasian golden oriole|Golden Oriole]] had lead-colour toes, other parts oil-green, brocoli-brown and wine-yellow. The [[Ross's gull|Cuneate-Tailed Gull]] was smoke-brown and pearl-grey, the [[Turnstone]] had ferruginus portions, the [[Little auk|Little Auk]] was livid-brown and sooty-brown, while the [[American bittern|American Bittern]] was leaden-brown. The variations in these terms seems to be inexhaustable. They can now be considered a {{sic|nolink=y|curiousity}}, somewhat romantic or just pure pedantry on the author’s part. But it was a serious attempt to try to define quite subtle colourings."&lt;ref name=Isabelline/&gt;

==In culture==

Yarrell's ''Birds'' was mentioned in a well-known letter to ''[[The Times]]'' in 1913, when a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]], the naturalist and paleontologist [[Richard Lydekker]], wrote on 6 February that he had heard a [[Common cuckoo|cuckoo]], explaining that though contrary to Yarrell's statement that records of the bird calling as early as March "must be treated with suspicion, if not with incredulity", it was a definite fact. Six days later on 12 February 1913, Lydekker wrote again, confessing that "the note was uttered by a bricklayer's labourer". Letters about the first cuckoo became a tradition in the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=Kenneth | title=First Cuckoo: Letters to "The Times", 1900–75 | publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin | year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==

[[File:Snowy Owl from Yarrell History of British Birds 1843.jpg|thumb|upright|Wood engraving of [[snowy owl]]. Drawn by Alexander Fussell and engraved on to boxwood by John Thompson.]]

''Birds'' was first published "in thirty-seven parts of three sheets each, at intervals of two months; the first Part was issued in July 1837, and the last in May 1843."&lt;ref group=P name=BirdsPreface&gt;Yarrell, 1843. pp. v-xii&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|&lt;nowiki&gt;The 3 volumes contain 1725 pages (not counting Preface and Index which cannot have been in the 37 parts). 27 species are listed in the Preface as having been added later, so at about 4 pages per species, deduct 108 leaving about 1617 pages issued in parts. These were issued on 3 x 37 sheets = 111 sheets in all. So there were at least 1617 ÷ 111 = 14.5 pages per sheet. Each printer's sheet must have contained 16 pages, 8 per side, with 8 of the pages printed upside-down, so that when folded they formed a booklet.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} The sheets were then collected into three volumes, with the addition of "many occurrences of rare birds, and of some that were even new to Britain". The additional birds were listed and briefly described in the Preface, and "the new subjects have been engraved on single leaves, so paged, that the bookbinder may insert these separate leaves among the birds of the genus to which each respectively belongs."&lt;ref group=P name=BirdsPreface/&gt;

The book came out in three different formats. The smallest is "octavo"; the two "large paper" formats are "royal octavo" and "imperial octavo". A supplement appeared in 1845; it was bound into the third volume of the rare "imperial octavo" edition of 1845, of which only 50 copies were printed.&lt;ref name=Amherst/&gt;

The fourth edition was revised and extended by the ornithologists [[Alfred Newton]] and [[Howard Saunders]], with some additional illustrations bringing the total number of engravings up to 564.

* First edition, 1843. 3 volumes. John Van Voorst, London.
:--- Supplement to first edition, 1845.
* Second edition, 1845.
* Third edition, 1856. Edited by Howard Saunders.
* Fourth edition, 4 volumes. I, 1871–1874. II, 1876–1882. III, 1882–1884. IV, 1884–1885. Edited by Howard Saunders.

==Tail-pieces==

Yarrell's tail-pieces, small engravings fitted into spaces at the ends of articles, follow the [[A History of British Birds#Woodcuts|tradition established by Bewick]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/discoveringbewick/search/moreinfo.php?topic=vignette&amp;querystr=aWQ9TkVXTkw6MjAwMy4yMC40NyZxdWVyeXN0cj1ZV3hzY21WekxuQm9jRDg9 |title=Discovering Bewick: Wood Engraving |publisher=Tyne and Wear Museums and Newcastle Libraries |year=2004 |accessdate=12 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226005606/http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/discoveringbewick/search/moreinfo.php?topic=vignette&amp;querystr=aWQ9TkVXTkw6MjAwMy4yMC40NyZxdWVyeXN0cj1ZV3hzY21WekxuQm9jRDg9 |archivedate=26 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but differ in rarely being whimsical. Many are secondary illustrations showing details of bird anatomy or features useful in identification.

'''Arthur Anoaʻi Sr.''' (born November 21, 1942) is a Samoan-American retired [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and [[Manager (professional wrestling)|professional wrestling manager]]. Since retiring, he has operated the [[World Xtreme Wrestling]] [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] and trained wrestlers at the Wild Samoan Training Center.&lt;ref name="Cagematch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=861|title=Afa|publisher=Cagematch.net|accessdate=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hornbaker2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Hornbaker|title=Legends of Pro Wrestling: 150 Years of Headlocks, Body Slams, and Piledrivers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UuGLDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT445|date=3 January 2017|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Company, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-61321-875-4|pages=445–446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Anoa'i was born on the island of [[Western Samoa Trust Territory|Western Samoa]], a trust territory that was then administered by [[Dominion of New Zealand|New Zealand]], and his family relocated to [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]] in the United States when he was young. At the age of 17, Anoa'i enlisted in the [[United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps]].&lt;ref name="Afa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildsamoan.com/afacorner.htm |title=Afa's Corner |publisher=WildSamoan.com |accessdate=2007-05-30 |year=2006 |quote=[Anoaʻi] was born and raised in the Island of Samoa, before moving with his family to San Francisco...Afa joined the Marines when he was only 17 years old. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324035534/http://www.wildsamoan.com/afacorner.htm |archivedate=March 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==
Upon leaving the Naval Sea Cadet Corps, Anoaʻi began training as a wrestler under family friends [[Rocky Johnson]] and [[Peter Maivia]]. He later received supplementary training from [[Kurt and Karl Von Steiger|Kurt Von Steiger]]. He wrestled his first match in 1971, in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. He then trained his brother [[Sika Anoaʻi|Sika]], and the siblings formed a [[tag team]] known best as [[Wild Samoans|The Wild Samoans]].&lt;ref name="WWE1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/wildsamoans/bio/ |title=The Wild Samoans |publisher=[[WWE]] |accessdate=2007-05-30 |year=2007 |quote=Arthur "Afa" Anoaʻi began his career being trained by his Uncle Peter Maivia and cousin Rocky Johnson after he left the United States Marine Corps. Afa would then train his brother, Leati "Sika" Anoaʻi, and the two would form a tag team. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520115336/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/wildsamoans/bio/ |archivedate=2007-05-20 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1970s, The Wild Samoans wrestled for the Canadian [[Stampede Wrestling]] promotion (where they received further training from [[Stu Hart]]) and for numerous [[National Wrestling Alliance]] affiliates. In 1978, The Wild Samoans traveled to Japan to wrestle for the International Wrestling Alliance, winning the IWA Tag Team Championship.&lt;ref name="OWW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/w/wild-samoans.html|title=The Wild Samoans|publisher=OnlineWorldOfWrestling.com|accessdate=2007-05-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070712141212/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/w/wild-samoans.html| archivedate= 12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Wrestling Federation (1979–1980, 1983–1984, 1992–1995)===
In 1979, The Wild Samoans joined the [[WWE#World Wrestling Federation|World Wrestling Federation]], where they were [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managed]] by [[Lou Albano]] and referred to as "Albano's Wildmen". The "wild" nature of the brothers was conveyed through their unorthodox behavior (which included communicating only in unintelligible grunts and consuming unprepared [[Raw foodism|raw]] [[fish]], during [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|interviews]] and while approaching the ring). While in the WWF, The Wild Samoans won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]]. Both members also challenged [[Bob Backlund]] for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Heavyweight Championship]] on several occasions. They left the promotion in 1980.&lt;ref name="WWE2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/wildsamoans/bio/ |title=The Wild Samoans |publisher=[[WWE]] |accessdate=2007-05-30 |year=2007 |quote=...they debuted in WWE in 1979...The Wild Samoans joined with manager Captain Lou Albano as they ascended the tag division...[they] were two men of very few words, but of many quirks.

The Wild Samoans then wrestled in [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]] and [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], before returning to the WWF (renamed from WWWF in 1979) in 1983 and regaining the WWF World Tag Team Championship. After Sika suffered an injury, the tag team was supplemented by Afa's son [[Samula Anoaʻi|Samu]] (the relationship was not acknowledged on TV). The trio remained in the WWF until 1984.&lt;ref name="OWW3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/w/wild-samoans.html|title=The Wild Samoans|publisher=OnlineWorldOfWrestling.com|accessdate=2007-05-30|quote=1981-82: The Wild Somoans wrestled in Bill Watt's Mid-South Wrestling...1982: The Wild Samoans had a brief stint in Jim Crockett's NWA: Mid Atlantic territory...1983: the Wild Samoans returned to the WWF...The Wild Samoans introduced [Samu], who temporarily replaced an injured Sika...| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070712141212/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/w/wild-samoans.html| archivedate= 12 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Afa, he lost his job because a few days earlier, Afa didn't come to work because he was at the birth of his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD notes |title=Beyond the Mat |origyear=2015 |type= |publisher=|location= |id= |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afa Anoaʻi returned to the WWF for a third time in 1992, as the manager and occasional tag partner of [[The Headshrinkers]] (Samu and Anoai's nephew, [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Fatu]]). He wrestled his final match on May 22, 1994, teaming with The Headshrinkers to defeat [[The Quebecers]] and [[Raven (wrestler)|Johnny Polo]] at the [[Rosemont Horizon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bios&amp;wrestler=1135&amp;bild=1&amp;details=11 Afa's match history, from WrestlingData.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Anoaʻi left the WWF in mid-1995.

===Late career===
After leaving the WWF, he began training wrestlers at his Wild Samoan Training Facility, along with Sika.&lt;ref name="WWE3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/wildsamoans/bio/ |title=The Wild Samoans |publisher=[[WWE]] |accessdate=2007-05-30 |year=2007 |quote=Afa was not seen in WWE until returning in 1992 to manage The Headshrinkers...Samu is Afa's son, and partner Fatu is [his] nephew...The Headshrinkers terrorized WWE competition under the leadership of Afa, and captured the World Tag Team Championship on one occasion. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520115336/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/wildsamoans/bio/ |archivedate=2007-05-20 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, 2007, the Wild Samoans were inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] by Samu and Sika's son, [[Rosey (wrestler)|Matt]].&lt;ref name="OWW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WWE4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/wildsamoans/bio/ |title=The Wild Samoans |publisher=[[WWE]] |accessdate=2007-05-30 |year=2007 |quote=Two more of their sons and trainees, Samula "Samu" Anoa'i (Afa) and Matt "Rosey" Anoa'i (Sika), inducted Afa [and] Sika into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2007. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520115336/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/wildsamoans/bio/ |archivedate=2007-05-20 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the wrestling trainer for [[Darren Aronofsky]]'s 2008 film, ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4620">[[Canadian Standards Association|CSA]]  '''CAN3-Z299''' is a series of [[quality assurance]] standards developed by the [[Canadian Standards Association]] in the 1970s.  It is an alternative to the [[ISO 9000]] series of standards.
The stated objectives of the Z299 series of standards are:

(a)	“To provide customers with assurance that products or services of the required quality will be supplied;
&lt;br /&gt;(b)	For suppliers to assume responsibility for achieving the required quality and then demonstrating that it has been provided.”&lt;ref&gt;''CAN3-Z299.0-86: Guide for Selecting and Implementing the CAN3-Z299-85 Quality Assurance Program Standards'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==CSA CAN3-Z299 Series==
CAN3-Z299 includes the following standards.  Z299.4, .3, .2, .1 apply increasingly rigorous quality assurance activities.  They were most recently reaffirmed in 2006.

===CAN3-Z299.0-86:  Guide for Selecting and Implementing the CAN3-Z299-85 Quality Assurance Program Standards===
The Guide provides the intent of the standards, compares the four quality assurance standards available in the series, and provides guidance on selecting the appropriate standard for the product or service.

===CAN3-Z299.4-85: Quality Assurance Program – Category 4===
Z299.4 is appropriate for mass-produced products designed to ordinary technical standards, or high volume services.  It includes requirements to:
*Carry out inspection and testing
*Have a plan to deal with non-conforming items
*Keep records
*Control measurement and testing equipment

===CAN3-Z299.3-85: Quality Assurance Program – Category 3===
Z299.3 is appropriate for products or services which involve some complex processes.  Failure of the product could cause significant monetary cost or some risk to health and safety.  It includes all of Z299.4 requirements, plus:
*Control of [[procurement]] activities
*Control of documentation
*[[Traceability]] of items
*Control packaging &amp; shipping
*A manual to document these activities

===CAN3-Z299.2-85: Quality Assurance Program – Category 2===
Z299.2 is for products or services requiring complex processes and technology, requiring planning in production and verification of design.  Failure of the product could cause high monetary cost or significant risk to health and safety.  It includes all of Z299.4 and Z299.3, plus:
*Control of manufacturing activities
*Control of handling and storage
*A plan to deal with multiple inspections and tests
*[[Corrective action]] program to prevent repetition of errors
*Procedures to describe these activities

===CAN3-Z299.1-85: Quality Assurance Program – Category 1===
Z299.1 is suitable for custom designed products or services with a high degree of technology.  Failure in service could result in extremely high monetary loss or high risk to health and safety.  It includes all of Z299.4, Z299.3, and Z299.2, plus:
*Control of design activities through procedures
*Independent [[audit]]s on the quality assurance program

==Quality Assurance Principles of Z299==
Z299 covers twenty-one areas of the product or service lifecycle:

1.	[[Request for tender|Tender]] and [[Contract]] Review&lt;br /&gt;
2.	Design&lt;br /&gt;
3.	Documentation&lt;br /&gt;
4.	Measuring and Test Equipment&lt;br /&gt;
5.	[[Procurement]]&lt;br /&gt;
6.	Inspection and Test Plans&lt;br /&gt;
7.	Incoming Inspection&lt;br /&gt;
8.	In-Process Inspection&lt;br /&gt;
9.	Final Inspection&lt;br /&gt;
10.	Inspection Status&lt;br /&gt;
11.	Identification and [[Traceability]]&lt;br /&gt;
12.	Handling and Storage&lt;br /&gt;
13.	Production&lt;br /&gt;
14.	Special Processes&lt;br /&gt;
15.	Packaging and Shipping&lt;br /&gt;
16.	Quality Records&lt;br /&gt;
17.	Nonconformance&lt;br /&gt;
18.	[[Corrective Action]]&lt;br /&gt;
19.	Customer Supplied Products and Services&lt;br /&gt;
20.	Statistical Techniques&lt;br /&gt;
21.	Quality [[Audit]]s

==Comparison to ISO 9000==
ISO 9000 and Z299 standards have many similar requirements.  One of the main differences between them is that Z299 requires Inspection and Test Plans to be submitted to the purchaser by the vendor, and independent inspection and testing.  The Inspection and Test Plan details key inspections and tests at certain points in the production process, and is meant to complement a generic quality program by providing detail on the requirements of a specific product.

Starting with ''[[The Teachings of Don Juan]]'' in 1968 and ending with ''[[The Active Side of Infinity]]'' in 1998, he wrote a series of books that described his putative experiences with the characters 'Don Juan Matus' and 'Genaro Flores' from 1960 to 1973.

{{Main| Denis Gifford}}

Denis Gifford was a prolific comic artist and writer, most active in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. Gifford's work was largely for humour strips in [[British comics]], often for [[L. Miller &amp; Son, Ltd.|L. Miller &amp; Son]]. He was a highly influential comics historian, particularly of British comics from the 19th century to the 1940s.

Gifford was also a committed comic collector of British and US comics, and owned what has been called the "world's largest collection of British comics." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry for Sunday Observer Christmas magazine 1974|url=http://www.millersantiquesguide.com/items/26003/sunday-observer-newspaper-christmas-magazine-22-december/|work=Millers Antiques Guide|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comics art and scriptwriting: Marvelman titles==
Gifford wrote, drew and often created a wide selection of back-up strips that featured in a number of the ''Marvelman'' titles, usually one-page humour strips, as well as the ''Marvelman Family'' strip in its own title. Gifford used a variety of pen-names for the work, including Belteshazzar Oakworm, Clubtwee Gleeb &lt;ref name="Darlington"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Darlington|first=Andrew|title=Daredevils of the Stratosphere|journal=The Mentor|date=October 1995|issue=88|pages=10|url=http://efanzines.com/Mentor/TM88COMP.pdf|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 'Fred Granule Bepp'.,&lt;ref name="Marvelman #365"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marvelman #365 entry|url=http://www.ausreprints.com/content/main/?issue=43518|work=AusReprints|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe King, Jack Upp and Belle Tupp.&lt;ref name="Marvelman #341"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aus Reprints|url=http://www.ausreprints.com/content/main/?issue=42902|work=Marvelman #341 entry|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These humour strips may have been reprinted across a number of titles in the L.

==Comics art and scriptwriting: personal projects==
Gifford created, or co-created, several titles, as well as publishing or editing and drawing together the work of other creators in a number of titles. Most notable was probably his co-creation with Bob Monkhouse of the superhero Streamline and the ''Streamline Comics'' title, but his short-lived ''Ally Sloper'' title was a significant if unsuccessful attempt to blend nostalgia for British comics with the more adult approach of the Modern Age to reach new audiences. Gifford and Monkhouse also combined to form Streamline Publications, specialising mostly in reprints of US comics and pulp novels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26667">This is a partial, non-exhaustive list of notable '''[[Online dating service|online dating]] websites and [[mobile app]]s'''.
&lt;!-- IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO THIS MESSAGE, YOUR EDIT WILL BE ROLLED BACK WITHOUT WARNING.
ONLY place entries here that are links to actual Wikipedia articles about notable dating networking sites. External links, redlinks, substubs, non-notable sites or sites that are not dating sites will be removed. If you have questions, use the talk page. Please try to keep entries in alphabetical order. Adding unnecessary links or text anywhere else will also be removed. Thanks.

Please see "WP:WEB" for information on notability for websites on Wikipedia.
Editors are encouraged to write the article first (See "WP:WTAF").

Do not even think of putting 'number of users' without providing a recent, CITED number (WITHOUT COMMAS). Wikipedia is an encyclopedia of fact not of guessed numbers, or numbers several years out of date. The number MUST match any number cited in the WP article on the site itself! It is not desirable for the site itself to be given as a source given such numbers may be artificially inflated.

Please use  and ***NO COMMAS*** for the user counts so they do not mess up sorting. Commas are automatically added.

For example: {{nts|1234567}}
Use {{ntsh}} with non-numeric user counts, for example:
{{ntsh|0}}Unknown
{{ntsh|1000}}Thousands

Please make sure the numbers shown on the table are "registered users" not "visitors". --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14416">{{For|the full list of country code top-level domains|List of Internet top-level domains}}

A '''country code top-level domain''' ('''ccTLD''') is an [[Internet]] [[top-level domain]] generally used or reserved for a [[country]], sovereign state, or [[dependent territory]] identified with a [[country code]].

All [[ASCII]] ccTLD identifiers are two letters long, and all two-letter top-level domains are ccTLDs. In 2018, the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) began implementing [[internationalized country code top-level domain]]s, consisting of language-native characters when displayed in an end-user application. Creation and delegation of ccTLDs is described in RFC 1591, corresponding to [[ISO 3166-1]] [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|alpha-2]] [[country codes]].

==Types==
{{main article|Top-level domain#Types}}

As of 2015, IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/ |title=IANA root zone database |publisher=Iana.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[.arpa|infrastructure top-level domain]] (ARPA)
*[[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLD)
*[[generic top-level domain|restricted generic top-level domains]] (grTLD)
*[[sponsored top-level domain]]s (sTLD)
*country code top-level domains (ccTLD)
*[[.test|test top-level domains]] (tTLD)

==Delegation and management==
IANA is responsible for determining an appropriate trustee for each ccTLD. Administration and control are then delegated to that trustee, which is responsible for the policies and operation of the domain. The current delegation can be determined from [http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm IANA's list of ccTLDs]. Individual ccTLDs may have varying requirements and fees for registering [[subdomains]]. There may be a local-presence requirement (for instance, citizenship or other connection to the ccTLD), as, for example, the [[Canada|Canadian]] ([[.ca|ca]]) and [[Germany|German]] ([[.de|de]]) domains, or registration may be open.

==History==
The first registered ccTLDs were [[.us]], [[.uk]], and [[.il]], all registered in 1985. In 1986, [[.au]], [[.de]], [[.fi]], [[.fr]], [[.jp]], [[.kr]], [[.nl]], and [[.se]] were registered.

==Relation to ISO 3166-1==
{{quote|The IANA is not in the business of deciding what is and what is not a country. The selection of the ISO 3166 list as a basis for country code top-level domain names was made with the knowledge that ISO has a procedure for determining which entities should be and should not be on that list.|[[Jon Postel]]|RFC 1591&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1591#section-4 |title=RFC 1591 - Domain Name System Structure and Delegation |date=March 1994 |author=[[Jon Postel]] |accessdate=2008-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Unused ISO 3166-1 codes===
Almost all current ISO 3166-1 codes have been assigned and do exist in DNS.
However, some of these are effectively unused. In particular, the ccTLDs for the Norwegian dependency [[Bouvet Island]] (&lt;tt&gt;[[.bv|bv]]&lt;/tt&gt;) and the designation [[Svalbard and Jan Mayen]] (&lt;tt&gt;[[.sj|sj]]&lt;/tt&gt;) do exist in DNS, but no subdomains have been assigned, and it is [[Norid]] policy to not assign any at present. Two [[France|French]] territories—&lt;tt&gt;[[.bl|bl]]&lt;/tt&gt; ([[Saint Barthélemy]]) and &lt;tt&gt;[[.mf|mf]]&lt;/tt&gt; ([[Saint Martin (France)|Saint Martin]])—{{As of|2008|alt=still}} await local assignment by France's government.

The code &lt;tt&gt;[[.eh|eh]]&lt;/tt&gt;, although eligible as ccTLD for [[Western Sahara]], has never been assigned and does not exist in [[Domain Name System|DNS]]. Only one subdomain is still registered in &lt;tt&gt;[[.gb|gb]]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnstools.ws/tools/lookup.php?host=dra.hmg.gb&amp;type=ANY|title=DNS loookup for dra.hmg.gb|year=2010|accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|talk=dra.hmg.gb|date=July 2013}} (ISO 3166-1 for the [[United Kingdom]]), and no new registrations are being accepted for it. Sites in the United Kingdom generally use &lt;tt&gt;[[.uk|uk]]&lt;/tt&gt; (see below).

The former [[.um]] ccTLD for the [[United States Minor Outlying Islands|U.S. Minor Outlying Islands]] was removed in April 2008. Under RFC 1591 rules, [[.um]] is eligible as a ccTLD on request by the relevant governmental agency and local Internet user community.

===ASCII ccTLDs not in ISO 3166-1===
Several ASCII ccTLDs are in use that are not ISO 3166-1 two-letter codes. Some of these codes were specified in older versions of the ISO list.
* &lt;tt&gt;[[.uk|uk]]&lt;/tt&gt; ([[United Kingdom]]): The ISO 3166-1 code for the United Kingdom is GB.  However, the [[JANET]] network had already selected &lt;tt&gt;uk&lt;/tt&gt; as a top-level identifier for its pre-existing [[JANET NRS|Name Registration Scheme]], and this was incorporated into the DNS root. &lt;tt&gt;[[.gb|gb]]&lt;/tt&gt; was assigned with the intention of a transition, but this never occurred and the use of &lt;tt&gt;uk&lt;/tt&gt; is now entrenched.
* &lt;tt&gt;[[.su|su]]&lt;/tt&gt; This obsolete ISO 3166 code for the [[Soviet Union]] was assigned when the Soviet Union was still extant; moreover, new &lt;tt&gt;su&lt;/tt&gt; registrations are accepted.
* &lt;tt&gt;[[.ac|ac]]&lt;/tt&gt; ([[Ascension Island]]): This code is a vestige of [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA's]] decision in 1996 to allow the use of codes reserved in the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] reserve list for use by the [[Universal Postal Union]]. The decision was later reversed, with Ascension Island now the sole outlier. (Three other ccTLDs, &lt;tt&gt;[[.gg|gg]]&lt;/tt&gt; ([[Guernsey]]), &lt;tt&gt;[[.im|im]]&lt;/tt&gt; ([[Isle of Man]]) and &lt;tt&gt;[[.je|je]]&lt;/tt&gt; ([[Jersey]]) also fell under this category from 1996 until they received corresponding ISO 3166 codes in March 2006.)
* &lt;tt&gt;[[.eu|eu]]&lt;/tt&gt; ([[European Union]]): On September 25, 2000, [[ICANN]] decided to allow the use of any two-letter code in the [[ISO 3166-1]] reserve list that is reserved for all purposes. Only EU currently meets this criterion. Following a decision by the EU's Council of Telecommunications Ministers in March 2002, progress was slow, but a [[domain name registry|registry]] (named [[EURid]]) was chosen by the [[European Commission]], and criteria for allocation set: [[ICANN]] approved &lt;tt&gt;[[.eu|eu]]&lt;/tt&gt; as a ccTLD, and it opened for registration on 7 December 2005 for the holders of prior rights. Since 7 April 2006, registration is open to all.

===Historical ccTLDs===
There are three ccTLDs that have been deleted after the corresponding 2-letter code was withdrawn from ISO 3166-1: &lt;tt&gt;[[.cs|cs]]&lt;/tt&gt; (for [[Czechoslovakia]]), &lt;tt&gt;[[.zr|zr]]&lt;/tt&gt; (for [[Zaire]]) and &lt;tt&gt;[[.tp|tp]]&lt;/tt&gt; (for [[East Timor]]). There may be a significant delay between withdrawal from ISO 3166-1 and deletion from the DNS; for example, ZR ceased to be an ISO 3166-1 code in 1997, but the &lt;tt&gt;zr&lt;/tt&gt; ccTLD was not deleted until 2001. Other ccTLDs corresponding to obsolete ISO 3166-1 codes have not yet been deleted. In some cases they may never be deleted due to the amount of disruption this would cause for a heavily used ccTLD. In particular, the Soviet Union's ccTLD &lt;tt&gt;[[.su|su]]&lt;/tt&gt; remains in use more than twenty years after SU was removed from ISO 3166-1.

The historical country codes &lt;tt&gt;[[.dd|dd]]&lt;/tt&gt; for the [[German Democratic Republic]] and &lt;tt&gt;yd&lt;/tt&gt; for [[South Yemen]] were eligible for a ccTLD, but not allocated; see also &lt;tt&gt;[[.de|de]]&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;[[.ye|ye]]&lt;/tt&gt;.

The temporary reassignment of country code &lt;tt&gt;cs&lt;/tt&gt; ([[Serbia and Montenegro]]) until its split into &lt;tt&gt;[[.rs|rs]]&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;[[.me|me]]&lt;/tt&gt; ([[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]], respectively) led to some controversies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The previous ISO 3166-1 code for [[Yugoslavia]], YU, was removed by ISO on 2003-07-23, but the &lt;tt&gt;[[.yu|yu]]&lt;/tt&gt; ccTLD remained in operation. Finally, after a two-year transition to Serbian &lt;tt&gt;[[.rs|rs]]&lt;/tt&gt; and Montenegrin &lt;tt&gt;[[.me|me]]&lt;/tt&gt;, the .yu domain was phased out in March 2010.

Australia was originally assigned the &lt;tt&gt;[[.au#Historic second-level domains|oz]]&lt;/tt&gt; country code, which was later changed to &lt;tt&gt;[[.au|au]]&lt;/tt&gt; with the &lt;tt&gt;.oz&lt;/tt&gt; domains moved to &lt;tt&gt;.oz.au&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Internationalized ccTLDs==
An [[internationalized country code top-level domain]] (IDN ccTLD) is a top-level domain with a specially encoded domain name that is displayed in an end user application, such as a [[web browser]], in its language-native script or [[alphabet]], such as the [[Arabic alphabet]], or a non-alphabetic [[writing system]], such as [[Chinese character]]s. IDN ccTLDs are an application of the [[internationalized domain name]] (IDN) system to top-level Internet domains assigned to countries, or independent geographic regions.

ICANN started to accept applications for IDN ccTLDs in November 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=ICANN Bringing the Languages of the World to the Global Internet|url=http://www.icann.org/en/announcements/announcement-30oct09-en.htm|date=30 October 2009|publisher=Internet Corporation For Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)|accessdate=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and installed the first set into the Domain Names System in May 2010. The first set was a group of Arabic names for the countries of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. By May 2010, 21 countries had submitted applications to ICANN, representing 11 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|title='Historic' day as first non-Latin web addresses go live
|publisher=BBC News|date=May 6, 2010
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/10100108.stm
|accessdate=2010-05-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICANN requires all potential international TLDs to use at least one letter that does not resemble a Latin letter, or have at least three letters, in an effort to avoid [[IDN homograph attack]]s. Nor shall the international domain name look like another domain name, even if they have different alphabets. Between Cyrillic and Greek alphabets, for example, this could happen.

==Unconventional usage==
{{Main article|Vanity URL}}
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
Lenient registration restrictions on certain ccTLDs have resulted in various [[domain hack]]s. Domain names such as &lt;tt&gt;I.am&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;tip.it&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;start.at&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;go.to&lt;/tt&gt; form well-known English phrases, whereas others combine the [[second-level domain]] and ccTLD to form one word or one title, creating domains such as &lt;tt&gt;[[blo.gs]]&lt;/tt&gt; of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] (&lt;tt&gt;[[.gs|gs]]&lt;/tt&gt;), &lt;tt&gt;[[YouTube|youtu.be]]&lt;/tt&gt; of [[Belgium]] (&lt;tt&gt;[[.be|be]]&lt;/tt&gt;), &lt;tt&gt;[[Delicious (website)|del.icio.us]]&lt;/tt&gt; of the [[United States]] (&lt;tt&gt;[[.us|us]]&lt;/tt&gt;), and &lt;tt&gt;[[cr.yp.to]]&lt;/tt&gt; of [[Tonga]] (&lt;tt&gt;[[.to|to]]&lt;/tt&gt;).  The &lt;tt&gt;.co&lt;/tt&gt; domain of Colombia has been cited since 2010 as a potential competitor to generic TLDs for commercial use, because it may be an abbreviation for ''company''.&lt;ref name="unique"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cointernet.co/frequently-asked-questions/general-co-faqs#q5 |title=General .CO FAQs: What makes .CO such a unique opportunity? |website=cointernet.co |accessdate=2013-07-20 |publisher=.CO Internet S.A.S. |location=Colombia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511154522/http://www.cointernet.co/frequently-asked-questions/general-co-faqs#q5 |archivedate=2013-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several ccTLDs allow the creation of [[emoji domain|emoji domains]].

Some ccTLDs may also be used for [[typosquatting]]. The domain ''cm'' of [[Cameroon]] has generated interest due to the possibility that people might miss typing the letter ''o'' for sites in the ''com''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Commercial usage===
Some of the world's smallest countries and non-sovereign or colonial entities with their own country codes have opened their TLDs for worldwide commercial use, some of them free like [[.tk]].

{{see also|List of the oldest buildings in the United States}}

The '''Crowninshield–Bentley House''' (circa 1727–1730) is a [[Colonial America|Colonial]] house in the Georgian style, located at 126 Essex Street, [[Salem, Massachusetts]] in the [[Essex Institute Historic District]]. It is now owned by the [[Peabody Essex Museum]] and open for public tours from June to October.

The house was originally built for sea captain John Crowninshield at a site on 106 Essex Street. It is a symmetrical five-bay structure, clapboarded, two stories tall, with three small dormers through the roof, and a central entry door. Compare it with the architecture of the [[Ropes Mansion]] and the [[Peirce-Nichols House]], also in Salem, and also owned by the Peabody Essex Museum.  Some believe it may have started as a "half house" on the east side, and been expanded in 1761 and again in 1794. The building was moved to its present location in 1959-1960, at which time it was restored.

Four generations of Crowninshields lived in the house until 1832. Its main historical interest centers upon Reverend [[William Bentley]], a boarder from 1791 to 1819.

It has been suggested that this house may be the model for "the old Crowninshield house" mentioned in the [[H. P. Lovecraft]] story "[[The Thing on the Doorstep]]" (&lt;ref&gt;his [[Arkham]] was modeled on the town of Ipswich, even though most critiques like to place it as Ipswich's more famous neighbor, Salem&lt;/ref&gt;).

{{Wiktionary|deed}}
{{Property law}}

A '''deed''' (anciently "an '''evidence'''") is any [[legal instrument]] in writing which passes, affirms or confirms an [[interest]], [[right]], or [[property]] and that is signed, attested, delivered, and in some [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdictions]], [[seal (emblem)|sealed]]. It is commonly associated with transferring ([[conveyancing]]) [[title (property)|title to property]]. The deed has a greater [[presumption]] of validity and is less [[Rebuttable presumption|rebuttable]] than an instrument signed by the party to the deed. A deed can be unilateral or bilateral. Deeds include [[conveyancing|conveyances]], [[Contract|commissions]], [[license]]s, [[patent]]s, [[diploma]]s, and conditionally [[power of attorney|powers of attorney]] if executed as deeds. The deed is the modern descendant of the medieval [[charter]], and delivery is thought to symbolically replace the ancient ceremony of [[livery of seisin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=E. Rory |last=O'Connor|title=The Irish Notary|location=Dublin|publisher= Professional Books|year= 1987|page= 83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional phrase ''signed, sealed and delivered'' refers to the practice of seals; however, attesting witnesses have replaced seals to some extent. Agreements under seal are also called [[contract]]s by deed or ''specialty''; in the United States, a specialty is enforceable without [[consideration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/contract-under-seal/|title=Contract under Seal Law &amp; Legal Definition|website=USLegal.com|accessdate=21 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503225201/http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/contract-under-seal|archivedate=3 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, specialties have a [[Legal liability|liability]] limitation period of double that of a [[simple contract]] and allow for a [[third party beneficiary]] to enforce an undertaking in the deed, thereby overcoming the doctrine of [[privity of contract|privity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrew |last=Griffiths|title=Contracting With Companies|location= London |publisher=[[Hart Publishing]] |year=2005| page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialties, as a form of contract, are [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] and can therefore be distinguished from [[Covenant (law)|covenants]], which, being also under seal, are unilateral promises.

== Requirements ==
At [[common law]], to be valid and enforceable, a deed must meet several requirements:
* It must state on its face that it is a deed, using wording like "This Deed..." or "executed as a deed".
* It must indicate that the instrument itself conveys some privilege or thing to someone.
* The [[grantor]] must have the legal ability to grant the thing or privilege, and the [[grantee]] must have the legal capacity to receive it.
* It must be executed by the grantor in presence of the prescribed number of witnesses, known as instrumentary witnesses (this is known as being '''in solemn form''').
* In some jurisdictions, a [[seal (device)|seal]] must be affixed to it. Originally, affixing seals made persons parties to the deed and signatures optional, but seals are now outdated in most jurisdictions, so the signatures of the grantor and witnesses are primary.
* It must be delivered to ('''delivery''') and, in some jurisdictions, accepted by the grantee ('''acceptance''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5057&amp;context=fss_papers |title=Delivery and Acceptance of Deeds |first=Henry Wade |last=Rogers |date=1 January 1881 |publisher=[[Yale University]] |accessdate=1 January 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218013158/http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5057&amp;context=fss_papers |archivedate=18 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions attached to the acceptance of a deed are known as [[Covenant (law)|covenants]]. A '''deed indented''' or '''indenture'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Deed |volume=7 |page=921}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one executed in two or more parts according to the number of parties, which were formerly separated by cutting in a curved or indented line known as the chirograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Frederic Jesup|last=Stimpson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4C8WAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Glossary of Technical Terms, Phrases, and Maxims of the Common Law|section=Deed|location=Boston|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Co.]]|year=1881|page=108|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124154135/http://books.google.com/books?id=4C8WAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=2013-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A '''[[deed poll]]''' is one executed in one part, by one party, having the edge polled or cut even, and includes simple grants and appointments.

==Deeds of conveyance==

===General and special warranty===
{{main|Warranty deed}}
[[File:Providence, Rhode Island, Original Deed.jpg|thumb|right|The original 1636 [[Aboriginal title in the United States|Indian deed]] creating the Colony of [[Rhode Island]] signed by Native American Chief [[Canonicus]] to [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]]]

In the transfer of real estate, a deed conveys ownership from the old owner (the grantor) to the new owner (the grantee), and can include various [[Warranty|warranties]]. The precise name and nature of these warranties differ by jurisdiction. Often, however, the basic differences between them is the degree to which the grantor warrants the title. The grantor may give a general warranty of title against any claims, or the warranty may be limited to only claims which occurred after the grantor obtained the real estate. The latter type of deed is usually known as a ''special [[warranty deed]]''. While a ''general warranty deed'' was normally used for residential real estate sales and transfers, special warranty deeds are becoming more common and are more commonly used in commercial transactions.

===Bargain and sale deed===
{{main|Bargain and sale deed}}

A third type of deed, known as a ''bargain and sale deed'', implies that the grantor has the right to convey title but makes no warranties against encumbrances.  This type of deed is most commonly used by court officials or [[Fiduciary|fiduciaries]] that hold the property by force of law rather than title, such as properties seized for unpaid taxes and sold at [[sheriff's sale]], or an [[executor]].

=== Quitclaim deed ===
{{main|Quitclaim deed}}

A so-called ''[[quitclaim deed]]'' is (in most jurisdictions) actually not a deed at all—it is actually an [[estoppel]] disclaiming rights of the person signing it to property.

===Deed of trust===
In some jurisdictions, a [[trust deed (real estate)|deed of trust]] is used as an alternative to a [[Mortgage law|mortgage]].  A deed of trust is not used to transfer property directly. It is commonly used in some states — California, for example — to transfer title to land to a “trustee”, usually a trust or title company, which holds the title as security ("in [[escrow]]") for a loan. When the loan is paid off, title is transferred to the borrower by recording a release of the obligation, and the trustee's contingent ownership is extinguished. Otherwise, upon default, the trustee will liquidate the property with a new deed and offset the lender's loss with the proceeds.

===Deeds as alternatives to bankruptcy===
* Deed of arrangement – document setting out an arrangement for a debtor to pay part or all outstanding debts, as an alternative to bankruptcy; (Australian law).&lt;ref name="lawbook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www2.lawhandbookonline.com.au/content/LHB10-glossary.48.1.html |publisher=Law Handbook Online|accessdate= 11 June 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918044925/http://www2.lawhandbookonline.com.au/content/LHB10-glossary.48.1.html|archivedate=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deed of assignment – document in which a debtor appoints a trustee to take charge of property to pay debts, partly or wholly, as an alternative to bankruptcy; (Australian law).&lt;ref name="lawbook" /&gt;

===Sanad===
[[File:Narain 1936.jpg|file|thumb|A ''sanad'' issued by the governor of the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh]] during the British Raj]]
{{see also|Doctrine of lapse}}
''Sanad'', also spelt as ''sunnud'', was a deed granted to the rulers of native [[princely state]]s in British India confirming them in their ruling position in return for their allegiance to the [[British Raj]].
====Sanad of adoption====
Since the extinction of the royal bloodline would be a ground for [[annexation]] of a principality by the British,&lt;ref&gt;Great Britain India Office. ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; some rulers were also granted ''sanads'' of adoption. Devised as a reward for loyalty to British rule in India, especially after the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]], such deeds gave a ruler the right to adopt chosen heirs from local noble families in case of lack of direct issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malleson|first= G. B.|title=An historical sketch of the native states of India|location=London |year=1875|edition=  1984 Delhi reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the rulers that were given Sanads of adoption, [[Takht Singh]], [[Jaswant Singh of Bharatpur]], as well as the rulers of [[Nagod State]], [[Samthar State]] and the [[Chaube Jagirs]] are worth mentioning.

==Structure==
The main clauses of a deed of conveyance are:
* Premises
** Parties clause – sets out the names, addresses, and descriptions (vendor/purchaser, grantor/grantee, transferor/transferee) of parties
** Recitals – narrates in chronological order the previous ownership of the property being conveyed, starting with the earliest deed of title down to the contract of sale the conveyance gives effect to
** Testatum – a command to witness which acknowledges the payment and receipt of the consideration and signals the beginning of the operative part; usually begins with "Now this Deed witnesseth"
* Operative part
** Operative clause – vendor gives effect to the contract of sale by conveying his interest in land to the purchaser
** Parcels clause – clause detailing the location and description of the property being conveyed
** Habendum – clause indicating the estate (freehold, etc.) or interest to be taken by the grantee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1-last=Rapalje|editor1-first=Stewart|editor2-last=Lawrence|editor2-first=Robert L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OwAVAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|encyclopedia=A Dictionary of American and English Law|title=Habendum|location=Jersey City, N.J.|publisher=F.D.

** Tenendum – "to have and to hold", formerly referring to the tenure by which the estate granted was to be held, though now completely symbolic
** Reddendum – reserves something to grantor out of thing granted, such as a rent, under the formula "yielding and paying".
** Conditions
** Warranty – grantor warrants the title to the grantee
*** general: when the warrant is against all persons
*** special: when it is only against the grantor, his heirs and those claiming under him
** Covenants – binding limitations or promises
* Conclusion (or [[eschatocol]]) – execution and date
** Testimonium (Scotland: ''testing clause'') – attests to the due execution of a deed or instrument.
*** Examples:
**** England &amp; Wales: ''In Witness Whereof, the parties to these presents have hereunto set their hands and seals''.
**** Ireland: ''In Witness Whereof the parties hereto have hereunto set their hands and affixed their seals [the day and year first herein written]''.
**** Scotland: ''IN WITNESS WHEREOF these presents, consisting of this and the preceding pages, are subscribed by [me] at [place] on the [day] day of [month] Two thousand and [year] in the presence of [name] of [address]''.

==Recording==
{{main|Recording (real estate)}}

Usually the transfer of ownership of real estate is registered at a [[cadastre]] in the [[United Kingdom]].  In most parts of the United States, deeds must be submitted to the [[recorder of deeds]], who acts as a cadastre, to be registered. An unrecorded deed may be valid proof of ownership between the parties, but may have no effect upon third-party claims until disclosed or recorded.  A local statute may prescribe a period beyond which unrecorded deeds become void as to third parties, at least as to intervening acts.

===Joint ownership===
Ownership transfer may also be crafted within deeds to pass by demise, as where a property is held in [[concurrent estate]] such as "joint tenants with right of survivorship" (JTWROS) or "tenants by the entirety". In each case, the title to the property immediately and automatically vests in the named survivor(s) upon the death of the other tenant(s).

In most states joint tenancy with the right of survivorship requires all owners to have equal interests in the property, meaning upon sale or partition of the property, all owners would receive an equal distribution of the proceeds.

Joint ownership may also be by tenants in common (TIC).  In some states, joint ownership is presumed to be as tenants in common unless the parties are married and the deed so states or the deed sets for joint tenants with right of survivorship.  Upon death, the decedent's share passes to his or her estate.

A [[life estate]] is the right to use, possess and enjoy the property for a period of time measured by the natural life of a person or persons.  When all life tenants are dead, the remainderman holds full title.

===Joint tenants with rights of survivorship vs. joint tenants in common===
When deeds are taken as joint tenants with rights of survivorship (JTWROS) or joint tenants in common (TIC), any co-owner can file a petition for partition to dissolve the tenancy relationship. JTWROS deed holders always take the property in equal shares; therefore, if the partnership is dissolved through partition, the proceeds must be equally distributed between all of the co-owners without regard to how much each co-owner contributed to the purchase price of the property. No credits would be allowed for any excess contributions to the purchase price. For example, if A and B co-own property as JTWROS and A contributed 80% of the purchase price, A and B would still receive equal distributions upon partition. On the other hand, TIC deed holders may be granted at partition a credit for unequal contributions to purchase price. During either partition, credits may be awarded to any co-owner who may have contributed in excess of his share to the property expenses after taking deed to the property. Credits may be allowed for utilities and maintenance; however, credits for improvements may not be allowed unless the improvements actually added substantial value to the property.

===Pardon as deed===
In the [[United States]], a [[pardon]] of the [[President of the United States|President]] was once considered to be a deed and thus needed to be accepted by the recipient. This made it impossible to grant a pardon posthumously. However, in the case of [[Henry Ossian Flipper]], this view was altered when President [[Bill Clinton]] pardoned him in 1999.

=== Title deed ===
The United Kingdom, England and Wales operate a 'property register'.  Title deeds are documents showing ownership, as well as rights, obligations, or mortgages on the property. Since around 2000, compulsory registration has been required for all properties mortgaged or transferred. The details of rights, obligations, and covenants referred to in deeds will be transferred to the register, a contract describing the property ownership.

=== Difference between a deed and an agreement ===
The main difference between a deed and an agreement is that the deed is generally signed by only one person / party. Examples of a deed are deeds of hypothecation for creating charge on movable properties in favour of the banks/financial institutions etc.

An agreement by its name suggests that there should be at least two parties signing/approving the same. Examples of an agreement are agreement to sale, loan agreement etc.

At common law, ownership was proven via an unbroken chain of title deeds. The [[Torrens title]] system is an alternative way of proving ownership. First introduced in [[South Australia]] in 1858 by Sir [[Robert Torrens]] and adopted later by the other Australian states and other countries, ownership under Torrens title is proven by possession of a certificate of title and the corresponding entry in the property register. This system removes risks associated with unregistered deeds and fraudulent or otherwise incorrect transactions. It is much easier and cheaper to administer, lowering transaction costs. Some Australian properties are still conveyed using a chain of title deeds – usually properties that have been owned by the same family since the nineteenth century – and these are often referred to as 'Old System' deeds.

===Wild deeds===
A deed that is recorded, but is not connected to the chain of title of the property, is called a '''wild deed'''. A wild deed does not provide constructive notice to later purchasers of the property, because subsequent bona fide purchasers cannot reasonably be expected to locate the deed while investigating the chain of title to the property. Haupt has stated that
&lt;blockquote&gt;Because title searching relies on the grantor/grantee indexes, it's possible that a deed won't be discovered even though it was recorded. "Example: Atwood sells his land to Burns, but Burns does not record his deed. Burns later sells the land to Cooper, and Cooper records her deed. But because the previous deed (the deed from Atwood to Burns) was not recorded, Cooper's deed is outside the chain of title. In a title search, someone looking up Atwood's name in the grantor index would find no indication that Atwood conveyed the property, and nothing would lead the searcher to Cooper's deed." A deed that is outside the chain of title is called a wild deed. The general rule is that a subsequent purchaser is not held to have constructive notice of a wild deed. In the example, Cooper's title is unprotected against subsequent good faith purchasers. Suppose Atwood were to fraudulently sell the same property to another person, Dunn. A court would rule that Dunn has good title to the property, not Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Kathryn J. |last=Haupt|title=Washington Real Estate Fundamentals|publisher=Rockwell Publishing|year= 2007|page= 54|isbn= 1-887051-41-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A wild deed has been described as a deed "executed by a stranger to the record title hung out in the air like Mahomet's coffin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Poladian v. Johnson |vol= 85|reporter=So. 2d |opinion=140 |pinpoint= 141 |court= [[Supreme Court of Florida]] |date=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mahomet is an archaic spelling of [[Muhammad]].  There is a legend that the Prophet Muhammad's coffin was suspended without visible supports, from the ceiling of his tomb, just as a wild deed just hangs there, not touching the chain of title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/mahomet.html|title=Mahomet|accessdate=21 August 2015|website=Infoplease.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908020352/http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/mahomet.html|archivedate=8 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry décembre.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]'', a famous [[illuminated manuscript]], is on view to both the public and to scholars only in the form of a high-quality facsimile]]
A '''facsimile''' (from [[Latin]] ''fac simile'' (to 'make alike')) is a copy or reproduction of an old [[book]], [[manuscript]], [[map]], [[Old master print|art print]], or other item of historical value that is as true to the original source as possible. It differs from other forms of reproduction by attempting to replicate the source as accurately as possible in scale, color, condition, and other material qualities. For books and manuscripts, this also entails a complete copy of all pages; hence, an incomplete copy is a "partial facsimile". Facsimiles are sometimes used by scholars to research a source that they do not have access to otherwise, and by museums and archives for [[media preservation]] and [[Art conservation and restoration|conservation]]. Many are sold commercially, often accompanied by a volume of commentary. They may be produced in [[limited edition]]s, typically of 500–2,000 copies, and cost the equivalent of a few thousand [[United States dollars]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}{{clarify|date=August 2018}} The term "[[fax]]" is a shortened form of "facsimile" though most faxes are not reproductions of the quality expected in a true facsimile.

==Facsimiles in the age of mechanical reproduction==
Advances in the art of facsimile are closely related to advances in [[printmaking]]. Maps, for instance, were the focus of early explorations in making facsimiles, although these examples often lack the rigidity to the original source that is now expected.&lt;ref name="koeman"&gt;C. Koeman, "An Increase in Facsimile Reprints," ''Imago Mundi'', vol. 18 (1964), pp. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt; An early example is the [[Abraham Ortelius]] [[map]] (1598).&lt;ref name="koeman"/&gt; Innovations during the 18th century, especially in the realms of  [[lithography]] and [[aquatint]], facilitated an explosion in the number of facsimiles of [[old master]] drawings that could be studied from afar.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Hartley, "Aquatint," ''The Oxford Companion to Western Art'', ed. Hugh Brigstocke. [[Oxford University Press]], 2001; [[Grove Art Online]], Oxford University Press, 2005. [accessed 20 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:RueMorgueManuscript.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Facsimile of Edgar Allan Poe's original manuscript for ''The Murders in the Rue Morgue'']] In the past, a technique such as the [[photostat]], [[hectograph]], or [[lithograph]] was usually used to create facsimiles. More recently, facsimiles have been made by the use of some form of [[photographic]] technique. For documents, a facsimile most often refers to document reproduction by a [[photocopy]] machine. In the digital age, an [[image scanner]], a [[personal computer]], and a [[desktop printer]] can be used to make a facsimile.

==Facsimiles and conservation==
Important [[illuminated manuscript]]s like [[Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]] are not only on display to the public as facsimiles, but available in high quality to scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facsimile-editions.com/en/about/institutions.aspx Public institutions with facsimile collections]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDD1E3FF936A15752C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Paul Lewis, "Preservation takes rare manuscripts from the public," ''New York Times''] - 25 January 1987 [accessed 19 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike normal book reproductions, facsimiles remain truer to the original colors—which is especially important for illuminated manuscripts—and preserve defects.&lt;ref name="um"&gt;[http://www.unimelb.edu.au/culturalcollections/exhibitions/facsimile/essay.html Bronwyn Stocks, "The Facsimile and the Manuscript,"] - an exhibition in the Leigh Scott Gallery, [[University of Melbourne]] (on-line catalogue with additional images).&lt;/ref&gt;

Facsimiles are best suited to printed or hand-written documents, and not to items such as three-dimensional objects or oil paintings with unique surface texture.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Godfrey, "Reproduction reproductive prints," ''The Oxford Companion to Western Art'', ed. Hugh Brigstocke. [[Oxford University Press]], 2001; [[Grove Art Online]], Oxford University Press, 2005. [accessed 20 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductions of those latter objects are often referred to as [[replica]]s.

The '''Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco''', comprising the [[de Young Museum]] in [[Golden Gate Park]] and the [[Legion of Honor (museum)|Legion of Honor]] in [[Lincoln Park (San Francisco)|Lincoln Park]], is the largest public arts institution in the city of [[San Francisco]]. The permanent collection of the Fine Arts Museums, with about 150,000 objects, is organized into nine areas, each with a [[curator]]ial staff.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Unlike most other major art museums, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco do not have a large [[financial endowment|endowment]] from which to draw. The museums operate on an annual budget funded by membership dues, ticket sales, donations (from [[philanthropy]] and [[grant (money)|grant]]s) and purchases in its stores.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey A. Fowler (August 4, 2011), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903341404576482200285214460# "Museum Invests in Crowd-Pleasers"], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt; They are run in a private-public partnership with the city of San Francisco, which owns the two museum buildings and covers about 23 percent of their operating expenses by providing security guards and paying insurance premiums. In 2016, the two museums drew a combined 1,402,000 visitors.&lt;ref name="artnewspaper"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170406-CPAI-Ranking2016Pub-Comp-.pdf |title="Visitor Figures 2016" |page=14 |newspaper=[[The Art Newspaper]] Review |date=April 2017 |accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco and the [[Louvre]] signed an agreement that provides for collaborative exhibitions and the sharing of art works. The agreement has a duration of five years. It creates a partnership to promote short- and long-term loans art works that allow the works to be seen in both cities, joint [[publication]]s, [[art conservation]] &lt;!--NOTE: DELIBERATE internal link to a [[WP:redirect]] page  --&gt; projects and educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Kozinn (November 15, 2012), [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/louvre-and-san-francisco-museums-sign-pact/ "Louvre and San Francisco Museums Sign Pact"], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The most general kind of form letter consists of one or more regions of [[boilerplate (text)|boilerplate text]] interspersed with one or more substitution placeholders.

Although form letters are generally intended for a wide audience, many form letters include stylistic elements or features intended to appear specifically tailored to the recipient.

==Uses==
Form letters are often used as replies from people who get large amounts of correspondence, such as [[celebrity|celebrities]] or [[politician]]s. This can lead to controversy if a form letter is used where a more personalised message would have been appropriate, such as when offering condolences.

Other form letters are used to notify candidates as part of an application process, such as acceptance or rejection letters from publishing companies, governing bodies, colleges, universities or prospective employers.

'''Franklin Sumner Earle''' (September 4, 1856 – January 31, 1929) was an [[United States|American]] [[mycologist]] who specialized in the diseases and cultivation of [[sugar cane]]. He was the first mycologist to work at the [[New York Botanical Garden]], and was the author of ''The Genera of North American Gill Fungi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mushroomthejournal.com/greatlakesdata/Authors/Earle42.html |work=IMA Historical Index of Mycologists |title=Franklin Sumner Earle |accessdate=2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Frankin Sumner Earle was born in [[Dwight, Illinois]], on September 4, 1856 to Parker Earle and Melanie Tracy. He spent much of his early youth at the Earle farm. Later he attended the [[University of Illinois]] sporadically in the 1880s, but never earned a degree. He studied with the mycologist [[Thomas Jonathan Burrill]].&lt;ref name="Chardon"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carlos E. Chardon |year=1929 |title=Franklin Sumner Earle |journal=[[Mycologia]] |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=301–303 |jstor=3753838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after college, Earle served as the superintendent of the Mississippi Agriculture Experiment Station (1892–1895). Soon after that Earle worked as a biologist and horticulturist of the Alabama Agriculture Experiment Station (1895–1900).&lt;ref name="Chardon"/&gt;

Earle worked as an Assistant Curator in charge of mycological collections at the [[New York Botanical Garden]] in 1901.&lt;ref name="Chardon"/&gt;

The '''Gelre Armorial''' ({{lang-nl|Wapenboek Gelre}}) is a medieval [[armorial]].

==History==
The armorial was compiled before 1396 by one Claes Heinenzoon (or Heynen, fl. 1345−1414) who was a  [[herald]] in the service of the [[Duchy of Guelders|Duke of Guelders]] and also the creator of the [[Beyeren Armorial]]. The book displays some 1,800 coats-of-arms from all over Europe, in color, and is one of the most important sources for medieval [[heraldry]].

The Gelre Armorial manuscript is nowadays preserved in the [[Royal Library of Belgium]] (signature code ms. 15652-5).  A copy from around 1500, produced by Cornelis Enghebrechtsz, is preserved in the library of {{Interlanguage link multi|Hoge Raad van Adel|nl}}. This version, however, only contains 1400 arms.  From 1880 to 1905, Victor Bouton produced 60 copies with hand-coloured arms.

===Earliest known colour depiction of the Danish Flag===

The book also contains the oldest known depiction linking the [[Denmark|Danish]] king to the red flag with white cross. On folio page 55v of the armorial, behind the sinister horn is a lance tip with a banner, displaying a white cross on red. The text left of the coat of arms says ''die coninc van denmarke'' ("the king of Denmark"). This is the earliest known coloured image of the ''[[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]]'' (Danish flag).

Posnett's work was also much influenced by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s concept of ''[[Weltliteratur]]'' ("world literature").  At the time of its publication, the ''Saturday Review'' stated "We find very little interest in Mr. Posnett's 'Comparative Literature.' The arrangement seems by no means well ordered.

The similar designation of '''Her Majesty's Canadian Submarine''' is applied to submarine vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/mobil/news-nouvelles-eng.asp?id=4094 |title=HMCS ''Victoria'' Conducts Diving Operations off the Coast of Vancouver Island |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524051526/http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/mobil/news-nouvelles-eng.asp?id=4094 |archivedate=2013-05-24 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In the reign of a [[monarch|king]], the designation changes to ''His Majesty's Canadian Ship''; the French version of the title remains unchanged in this instance. The title is derived from ''[[Her Majesty's Ship]]'' (HMS), used in the [[United Kingdom]]. The person who is [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch of Canada]] is also equally and separately the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].

Various [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[Commonwealth realm|realms]] use derivative variations to designate their warships, such as [[Her Majesty's Australian Ship]] (HMAS) and [[Her Majesty's New Zealand Ship]] (HMNZS).

==Usage==
After the formation of [[Royal Canadian Navy|Naval Service of Canada]] in 1910, warships were given the prefix HMCS with the "C" representing Canadian as a way to differentiate Canadian from British warships. It was initially the only concession the British [[Admiralty]] made following the formation of the Canadian naval service.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; {{HMCS|Rainbow|1891|6}} was the first ship with the HMCS designation after being transferred from the British [[Royal Navy]] to Canada, [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 4 August 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston et al., p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; {{HMCS|Haida}} became the first Canadian ship commissioned under a Queen during March 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hmcshaida.ca/hhistory.html |title=HMCS Haida |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717011101/http://www.hmcshaida.ca/hhistory.html |website=hmcshaida.ca |archivedate=17 July 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many RCN shore facilities also bear the designation, such as {{HMCS|Trinity}}, {{HMCS|Chippawa}}, {{HMCS|Discovery}}, {{HMCS|Stone Frigate}}, and all [[Royal Canadian Sea Cadets]] summer training centres, such as [[CSTC HMCS Quadra|HMCS ''Quadra'']]. Shore maintenance and mooring facilities bear the name '''Her Majesty's Canadian Dockyard''' (HMC Dockyard) (in [[French language|French]] '''L’arsenal canadien de Sa Majesté''' (Arsenal CSM)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/pri/4/bases/esquimalt-eng.asp |title=Royal Canadian Navy - Infrastructure and Environment |publisher=Minister of National Defence |date=13 January 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712211314/http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/pri/4/bases/esquimalt-eng.asp |archivedate=12 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/marlant/3/3-e_eng.asp | title=Royal Canadian Navy - CFB Halifax | publisher=Minister of National Defence | date=16 January 2006 | accessdate=26 March 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/611CB8bTJ?url=http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/marlant/3/3-e_eng.asp | archivedate=18 August 2011 | df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:'King and Queen' by Henry Moore, Glenkiln - geograph.org.uk - 36115.jpg|thumb|''King and Queen'' at Glenkiln, Dumfries, Scotland]]

'''''King and Queen''''' (LH 350) is a bronze sculpture by [[Henry Moore]], designed in 1952.  It depicts two figures, one male and one female, seated beside each other on a bench, both facing slightly to the left.  It is Moore's only sculpture depicting a single pair of adult figures.  Moore's records suggest it was originally known as ''Two Seated Figures''.

Ten bronze casts of the {{convert|27|cm}} high [[maquette]] were cast in 1952.  Five bronze casts of the {{convert|164|cm}} high full-size sculpture were made in 1953, with one further cast in 1957 and another in the 1980s, creating an edition of "5 +2" (five for sale, and two artist's copies).  Examples are held by the [[Middelheim Open Air Sculpture Museum]], [[Glenkiln Sculpture Park]], [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], [[Norton Simon Museum]], [[Tate Gallery]], [[MOA Museum of Art]], and the [[Henry Moore Foundation]].&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/moore-king-and-queen-t00228|title= Henry Moore OM, CH ''King and Queen'' 1952–3, cast 1957|accessdate=May 5, 2013|publisher=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maquettes==
According to Moore, speaking years later, the work was inspired by double statues of male and female figures from [[Ancient Egypt]], and by fairy tales read to his daughter Mary.  Art critics have suggested links with the accession of [[Elizabeth II]] in 1952, and have identified a strikingly similar photograph of Moore and his wife Irina seated beside each other c.1952, in which Moore has one hand clenched in his lap and the other on the arm of the sofa, and Irina sits beside him with her fingers interlaced.

It was based on preliminary drawings of seated figures from the late 1940s.  Inspiration came to Moore from playing with pieces of wax which became an initial [[maquette]] in 1952.  He first created a bearded head with a crown which became the "king" figure, then the female "queen" and the bench.  The king had a clenched fist, and the feet were little defined.  The maquette had a narrow squared frame behind the figures, defining the space, recalling similar frames used by [[Alberto Giacometti]] for example in his ''The Nose'' and ''The Cage'', and the frames used repeatedly in the paintings of [[Francis Bacon]], such as his ''[[Three Studies of the Male Back]]''.  The {{convert|27|cm}} high maquette was later cast in an edition of ten bronzes (LH 348).  Examples were sold at [[Sotheby's]] in 2001 for £531,500, at [[Christie's]] in 2010 for over US$2.8m, and at Sotheby's in 2016 for £1.1m.

A copy of the maquette was made in plaster, but only fragments survive.  It was used to scale up the sculpture to a full-size plaster working model, ''Maquette for King and Queen 1952–3''.  [[Anthony Caro]] made a three quarter size terracotta model of the queen figure, which was cast in bronze in an edition of five, as ''Seated Figure 1952–3'' (LH 345).   In this work, the hands are ill defined, and head does not have the crown-like looping feature.

==Description==
The full size sculpture is {{convert|165|cm}} high.  It depicts two figures, one male and one female, seated beside each other on a bench, both facing slightly to the left.  

The male figure to the left is slightly taller and broader, and sits slightly further back.  It has two angular jawlines that reach forward towards a prominent chin, where it meets a third line marking the nose, with excavated cheeks and eyehole pierced between the nose ridge.   There is a semi-circular loop adornment on top of the head, like a crown.  The figure has narrow arms, with one hand one in the figure's lap and the other resting on the bench.  The broad, flattened torso has few features and it is probably clothed.  The legs are mostly covered by a folded tunic, with ankles and bare feet visible, feet resting on the ground.  The hollowed concave back of the figure is incised with vertical lines recalling a backbone.

The female figure to the right is in a similar seated pose.  It has a similar flattened face with pierced eyehole but no prominent jawline.  There are incised eyelashes around the hole on the left side of the face.  Bumps at the back of the head suggests a piled up arrangement of hair, and a loop over the head suggests a diadem or tiara.  The figure has a similar flattened body, but with two domed breasts.  Its thin arms lead to hands clasped on the figure's lap.  It is also wearing a tunic, with pleats that cover most of the legs except the feet.  

Moore paid special attention to hands in the final model, to give it additional interest for the viewer.  He used the hands of his wife Irina and his six year old daughter Mary, and others, as models .  Moore's assistant [[Alan Ingham]] modelled for the feet of the king figure.  The head of the queen figure was remodelled three times before Moore was satisfied.  In the final work, Moore left out the square frame behind the figures in the maquette: he said it made them look like they were goalkeepers at a soccer game.

==Casts==
Moore completed a full-size model in plaster in 1953,and it was cast at the [[Art Bronze Foundry]] in London, using the [[lost wax]] technique to create pieces that were then welded together, to create an edition of 4+1 (four for sale, and one artist's copy).  A fifth numbered cast and second artist's copy were cast later.

The first full-size cast of the sculpture was exhibited at the Second Biennial for Sculpture at [[Middelheim Park]] in Antwerp in 1953.  It was bought by the city of Antwerp for the [[Middelheim Open Air Sculpture Museum]], where it remains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middelheimmuseum.be/en/page/henry-moore-united-kingdom King and Queen], Middelheim Museum&lt;/ref&gt;  It measures {{convert|170|x|150|x|95|cm}}.

The second cast was bought by Sir [[William Keswick]] in 1954 and installed in the isolated Scottish countryside at [[Glenkiln]] in Dumfriesshire, on a remote rock outcrop looking over Lock Glenkiln.  It is now part of the [[Glenkiln Sculpture Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henry-moore.org/works-in-public/world/uk/glenkiln/glenkiln-estate/king-and-queen-1952-53-lh-350 Henry Moore Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; This cast was decapitated in 1995 but later restored.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne MacDonald (1 August 1995), [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/reward-offered-for-moore-statues-heads-1594194.html Reward offered for Moore statue's heads] ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third cast was exhibited at the [[Curt Valentin|Curt Valentin Gallery]] in New York, was bought by [[Joseph H. Hirshhorn]], and is now in the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hirshhorn.si.edu/search-results/search-result-details/?edan_search_value=hmsg_66.3635 Hirshhorn]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A fourth cast was exhibited at the [[Leicester Galleries]] in London in February 1954, to mixed reviews, some disliking the mixture of figurative and abstract elements.  It was described by [[Robert Melville (art critic)|Robert Melville]] in 1954 as "Moore's finest achievement since the war, and probably the most graceful of all his works".  It was bought by newspaper editor [[David Astor]], and displayed at his home in [[St John's Wood]], until sold to the [[Norton Simon Museum of Art]] in Pasadena in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nortonsimon.org/art/detail/M.1976.03.S Simon Norton]&lt;/ref&gt;

A fifth cast was made for the [[Tate Gallery]] in 1957, acquired using funds donated by [[Associated Rediffusion]], delivered in early 1959.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt;  It measures {{convert|163.5|x|138.5|x|84.5|cm}}

The original artist's copy (cast 0) is now in the collection of the [[MOA Museum of Art]] in [[Atami]], Japan.  A second artist's copy, cast 00, was created in the 1980s for the [[Henry Moore Foundation]], and is displayed at [[Perry Green, Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henry-moore.org/hmf/news/previous-news-items1/king-and-queen-return-to-perry-green King and Queen back at Perry Green], Henry Moore Foundation, 17 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lightweight Directory Access Protocol'''  ('''LDAP''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|l|d|æ|p}}) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard [[application protocol]] for accessing and maintaining distributed [[Directory service|directory information services]] over an [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4511.txt |title=Network Working Group RFC 4511 |publisher=IETF.org |date=2006-06-01|accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Directory service]]s play an important role in developing [[intranet]] and Internet applications by allowing the sharing of information about users, systems, networks, services, and applications throughout the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.oracle.com/cd/A87860_01/doc/ois.817/a83729/adois09.htm |title=Directory Services LDAP |publisher=Oracle.com |accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As examples, directory services may provide any organized set of records, often with a hierarchical structure, such as a corporate [[email]] directory.  Similarly, a [[telephone directory]] is a list of subscribers with an address and a phone number.

LDAP is specified in a series of [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) Standard Track publications called [[Request for Comments]] (RFCs), using the description language [[Abstract Syntax Notation One|ASN.1]]. The latest specification is Version 3, published as RFC 4511&lt;ref name="gracion"&gt;[http://www.gracion.com/server/whatldap.html What is LDAP?]. Gracion.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt; (a road map to the technical specifications is provided by [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4510 RFC4510]).

A common use of LDAP is to provide a central place to store usernames and passwords. This allows many different applications and services to connect to the LDAP server to validate users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to OpenLDAP Directory Services|url=http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/intro.html|website=OpenLDAP|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LDAP is based on a simpler subset of the standards contained within the [[X.500]] standard.  Because of this relationship, LDAP is sometimes called X.500-lite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/L/LDAP.html |title=LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol |publisher=Webopedia.com |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Telecommunication companies' understanding of directory requirements were well developed after some 70 years of producing and managing telephone directories. These companies introduced the concept of directory services to [[information technology]] and [[computer networking]], their input culminating in the comprehensive [[X.500]] specification,&lt;ref&gt;The [[X.500]] series - ITU-T Rec. X.500 to X.521&lt;/ref&gt; a suite of protocols produced by the [[ITU|International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) in the 1980s.

X.500 directory services were traditionally accessed via the X.500 [[Directory Access Protocol]] (DAP), which required the [[Open Systems Interconnection]] (OSI) [[OSI protocols|protocol stack]]. LDAP was originally intended to be a lightweight alternative protocol for accessing X.500 directory services through the simpler (and now widespread) [[TCP/IP]] protocol stack.  This model of directory access was borrowed from the [[DIXIE]] and [[Directory Assistance Service]] protocols.

The protocol was originally created&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Howes |first=Tim |url=http://www.openldap.org/pub/umich/ldap.pdf |title=The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol: X.500 Lite |deadurl=no |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Tim Howes]] of the [[University of Michigan]], [[Steve Kille]] of Isode Limited, [[Colin Robbins (software engineer)|Colin Robbins]] of [[Nexor]] and [[Wengyik Yeong]] of [[PSINet|Performance Systems International]], circa 1993, as a successor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pre-History of LDAP|url=http://cybermatters.info/2013/04/09/prehistory-of-ldap/|website=Cyber Matters|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[DIXIE]] and [[Directory Assistance Service|DAS]]. Mark Wahl of Critical Angle Inc., [[Tim Howes]], and [[Steve Kille]] started work in 1996 on a new version of LDAP, LDAPv3, under the aegis of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).  LDAPv3, first published in 1997, superseded LDAPv2 and added support for extensibility, integrated the [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer]], and better aligned the protocol to the 1993 edition of X.500. Further development of the LDAPv3 specifications themselves and of numerous extensions adding features to LDAPv3 has come through the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]].

In the early engineering stages of LDAP, it was known as ''Lightweight Directory Browsing Protocol'', or ''LDBP''.  It was renamed with the expansion of the scope of the protocol beyond directory browsing and searching, to include directory update functions. It was given its ''Lightweight'' name because it was not as network intensive as its DAP predecessor and thus was more easily implemented over the Internet due to its relatively modest bandwidth usage.

LDAP has influenced subsequent Internet protocols, including later versions of X.500, [[XML Enabled Directory]] (XED), [[Directory Service Markup Language]] (DSML), [[Service Provisioning Markup Language]] (SPML), and the [[Service Location Protocol]] (SLP).

==Protocol overview==
A client starts an LDAP session by connecting to an LDAP server, called a [[Directory System Agent]] (DSA), by default on [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] [[Port (computer networking)|port]] 389, or on port 636 for LDAPS (LDAP over SSL, see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?&amp;page=7|title = Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry|publisher = [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]]|accessdate = 7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The client then sends an operation request to the server, and the server sends responses in return. With some exceptions, the client does not need to wait for a response before sending the next request, and the server may send the responses in any order. All information is transmitted using [[Basic Encoding Rules]] (BER).

The client may request the following operations:
* StartTLS — use the LDAPv3 [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) extension for a secure connection
* Bind — [[Authentication|authenticate]] and specify LDAP protocol version
* Search — search for and/or retrieve directory entries
* Compare — test if a named entry contains a given attribute value
* Add a new entry
* Delete an entry
* Modify an entry
* Modify Distinguished Name (DN) — move or rename an entry
* Abandon — abort a previous request
* Extended Operation — generic operation used to define other operations
* Unbind — close the connection (not the inverse of Bind)

In addition the server may send "Unsolicited Notifications" that are not responses to any request, e.g. before the connection is timed out.

A common alternative method of securing LDAP communication is using an [[Secure Socket Layer|SSL]] [[tunneling protocol|tunnel]]. The default port for LDAP over SSL is 636. The use of LDAP over SSL was common in LDAP Version 2 (LDAPv2) but it was never standardized in any formal specification. This usage has been deprecated along with LDAPv2, which was officially retired in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3494 RFC3494]&lt;/ref&gt; Global Catalog is available by default on ports 3268, and 3269 for LDAPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc978012.aspx|title = Global Catalog and LDAP Searches|date = 2014-08-05|accessdate = 2014-08-05|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directory structure==
The protocol provides an interface with directories that follow the 1993 edition of the [[X.500]] model:
* An entry consists of a set of attributes.
* An attribute has a name (an ''attribute type'' or ''attribute description'') and one or more values. The attributes are defined in a ''schema'' (see below).
* Each entry has a unique identifier: its ''Distinguished Name'' (DN). This consists of its ''Relative Distinguished Name'' (RDN), constructed from some attribute(s) in the entry, followed by the parent entry's DN. Think of the DN as the [[full path|full file path]] and the RDN as its relative filename in its parent folder (e.g. if &lt;code&gt;/foo/bar/myfile.txt&lt;/code&gt; were the DN, then &lt;code&gt;myfile.txt&lt;/code&gt; would be the RDN).

A DN may change over the lifetime of the entry, for instance, when entries are moved within a tree. To reliably and unambiguously identify entries, a [[Universally Unique Identifier|UUID]] might be provided in the set of the entry's ''operational attributes''.

An entry can look like this when represented in [[LDAP Data Interchange Format]] (LDIF) (LDAP itself is a [[binary protocol]]):
&lt;pre&gt;
 dn: cn=John Doe,dc=example,dc=com
 cn: John Doe
 givenName: John
 sn: Doe
 telephoneNumber: +1 888 555 6789
 telephoneNumber: +1 888 555 1232
 mail: john@example.com
 manager: cn=Barbara Doe,dc=example,dc=com
 objectClass: inetOrgPerson
 objectClass: organizationalPerson
 objectClass: person
 objectClass: top
&lt;/pre&gt;
"&lt;code&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt;" is the distinguished name of the entry; it is neither an attribute nor a part of the entry. "&lt;code&gt;cn=John Doe&lt;/code&gt;" is the entry's RDN (Relative Distinguished Name), and "&lt;code&gt;dc=example,dc=com&lt;/code&gt;" is the DN of the parent entry, where "&lt;code&gt;dc&lt;/code&gt;" denotes '[[Domain Name System|Domain Component]]'. The other lines show the attributes in the entry. Attribute names are typically mnemonic strings, like "&lt;code&gt;cn&lt;/code&gt;" for common name, "&lt;code&gt;dc&lt;/code&gt;" for domain component, "&lt;code&gt;mail&lt;/code&gt;" for e-mail address, and "&lt;code&gt;sn&lt;/code&gt;" for surname.

A server holds a subtree starting from a specific entry, e.g. "&lt;code&gt;dc=example,dc=com&lt;/code&gt;" and its children. Servers may also hold references to other servers, so an attempt to access "&lt;code&gt;ou=department,dc=example,dc=com&lt;/code&gt;" could return a ''referral'' or ''continuation reference'' to a server that holds that part of the directory tree. The client can then contact the other server. Some servers also support ''chaining'', which means the server contacts the other server and returns the results to the client.

LDAP rarely defines any ordering: The server may return the values of an attribute, the attributes in an entry, and the entries found by a search operation in any order. This follows from the formal definitions - an entry is defined as a [[set (computer science)|set]] of attributes, and an attribute is a set of values, and sets need not be ordered.

==Operations==

===Add===
The ADD operation inserts a new entry into the directory-server database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511#section-4.7 Add section of RFC4511]&lt;/ref&gt; If the distinguished name in the add request already exists in the directory, then the server will not add a duplicate entry but will set the result code in the add result to decimal 68, "entryAlreadyExists".&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511#appendix-A LDAP result codes]&lt;/ref&gt;
* LDAP-compliant servers will never dereference the distinguished name transmitted in the add request when attempting to locate the entry, that is, distinguished names are never de-aliased.
* LDAP-compliant servers will ensure that the distinguished name and all attributes conform to naming standards.
* The entry to be added must not exist, and the immediate superior must exist.
&lt;pre&gt;
dn: uid=user,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: add
objectClass: top
objectClass: person
uid: user
sn: last-name
cn: common-name
userPassword: password
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the above example, &lt;code&gt;uid=user,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com&lt;/code&gt; must not exist, and &lt;code&gt;ou=people,dc=example,dc=com&lt;/code&gt; must exist.

===Bind (authenticate)===
When an LDAP session is created, that is, when an LDAP client connects to the server, the '''authentication state''' of the session
is set to anonymous. The BIND operation establishes the authentication state for a session.

Simple BIND and SASL PLAIN can send the user's DN and password in [[plaintext]], so the connections utilizing either Simple or SASL PLAIN
should be encrypted using [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS). The server typically checks the password against the &lt;code&gt;userPassword&lt;/code&gt;
attribute in the named entry.  Anonymous BIND (with empty DN and password) resets the connection to anonymous state.

[[Simple Authentication and Security Layer|SASL]] (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) BIND provides authentication services through a
wide range of mechanisms, e.g. [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] or the [[client certificate]] sent with
TLS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iana.org/assignments/sasl-mechanisms/sasl-mechanisms.xml SASL Mechanisms at IANA]&lt;/ref&gt;

BIND also sets the LDAP protocol version by sending a version number in the form of an integer. If the client requests a version that the server does not support,
the server must set the result code in the BIND response to the code for a protocol error. Normally clients should use LDAPv3, which is the
default in the protocol but not always in LDAP libraries.

BIND had to be the first operation in a session in LDAPv2, but is not required as of LDAPv3. In LDAPv3, each
successful BIND request changes the authentication state of the session and each unsuccessful BIND request resets the authentication state
of the session.

===Delete===
To delete an entry, an LDAP client transmits a properly formed delete request to the server.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511#section-4.8 RFC4511: delete request]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A delete request must contain the distinguished name of the entry to be deleted
* Request controls may also be attached to the delete request
* Servers do not dereference aliases when processing a delete request
* Only leaf entries (entries with no subordinates) may be deleted by a delete request. Some servers support an operational attribute &lt;code&gt;hasSubordinates&lt;/code&gt; whose value indicates whether an entry has any subordinate entries, and some servers support an operational attribute &lt;code&gt;numSubordinates&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-boreham-numsubordinates-01 Boreham Draft (numSubordinates)]&lt;/ref&gt; indicating the number of entries subordinate to the entry containing the &lt;code&gt;numSubordinates&lt;/code&gt; attribute.
* Some servers support the subtree delete request control permitting deletion of the DN and all objects subordinate to the DN, subject to access controls. Delete requests are subject to access controls, that is, whether a connection with a given authentication state will be permitted to delete a given entry is governed by server-specific access control mechanisms.

===Search and Compare===
The Search operation is used to both search for and read entries.  Its parameters are:
; baseObject : The name of the base object entry (or possibly the root) relative to which the search is to be performed.
; scope : What elements below the baseObject to search. This can be &lt;code&gt;BaseObject&lt;/code&gt; (search just the named entry, typically used to read one entry), &lt;code&gt;singleLevel&lt;/code&gt; (entries immediately below the base DN), or &lt;code&gt;wholeSubtree&lt;/code&gt; (the entire subtree starting at the base DN).
; filter : Criteria to use in selecting elements within scope. For example, the filter &lt;code&gt;(&amp;(objectClass=person)(|(givenName=John)(mail=john*)))&lt;/code&gt; will select "persons" (elements of objectClass &lt;code&gt;person&lt;/code&gt;) where the matching rules for &lt;code&gt;givenName&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mail&lt;/code&gt; determine whether the values for those attributes match the filter assertion. Note that a common misconception is that LDAP data is case-sensitive, whereas in fact matching rules and ordering rules determine matching, comparisons, and relative value relationships. If the example filters were required to match the case of the attribute value, an ''extensible match filter'' must be used, for example, &lt;code&gt;(&amp;(objectClass=person)(|(givenName:caseExactMatch:=John)(mail:caseExactSubstringsMatch:=john*)))&lt;/code&gt;
; derefAliases : Whether and how to follow alias entries (entries that refer to other entries),
; attributes : Which attributes to return in result entries.
; sizeLimit, timeLimit : Maximum number of entries to return, and maximum time to allow search to run. These values, however, cannot override any restrictions the server places on size limit and time limit.
; typesOnly : Return attribute types only, not attribute values.

The server returns the matching entries and potentially continuation references. These may be returned in any order.  The final result will include the result code.

The Compare operation takes a DN, an attribute name and an attribute value, and checks if the named entry contains that attribute with that value.

===Modify===
The MODIFY operation is used by LDAP clients to request that the LDAP server make changes to existing entries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511#section-4.6 Modify Section of RFC4511]&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to modify entries that do not exist will fail. MODIFY requests are subject  to access controls as implemented by the server.

The MODIFY operation requires that the distinguished name (DN) of the entry be specified, and a sequence of changes. Each change in the sequence must be one of:
* add (add a new value, which must not already exist in the attribute)
* delete (delete an existing value)
* replace (replace an existing value with a new value)

[[LDAP Data Interchange Format|LDIF]] example of adding a value to an attribute:

&lt;pre&gt;
dn: dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
add: cn
cn: the-new-cn-value-to-be-added
-
&lt;/pre&gt;

To replace the value of an existing attribute, Use the &lt;tt&gt;replace&lt;/tt&gt; keyword. If the attribute is multi-valued, the client must specify the value of the attribute to update.

To delete an attribute from an entry, use the keyword &lt;tt&gt;delete&lt;/tt&gt; and the changetype designator &lt;tt&gt;modify&lt;/tt&gt;. If the attribute is multi-valued, the client must specify the value of the attribute to delete.

There is also a Modify-Increment extension&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF|title=LDAP Modify-Increment Extension|rfc=4525|first=K.|last=Zeilenga}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows an incrementable attribute value to be incremented by a specified amount. The following example using LDIF increments &lt;tt&gt;employeeNumber&lt;/tt&gt; by &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;
dn: uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
increment: employeeNumber
employeeNumber: 5
-
&lt;/pre&gt;

When LDAP servers are in a replicated topology, LDAP clients should consider using the post-read control to verify updates instead of a search after an update.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite IETF|title = Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Read Entry Controls|rfc = 4527|publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]|last = Zeilenga|first = K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post-read control is designed so that applications need not issue a search request after an update – it is bad form to retrieve an entry for the sole purpose of checking that an update worked because of the replication [[eventual consistency]] model. An LDAP client should not assume that it connects to the same directory server for each request because architects may have placed load-balancers or LDAP proxies or both between LDAP clients and servers.

===Modify DN===
Modify DN (move/rename entry) takes the new RDN (Relative Distinguished Name), optionally the new parent's DN, and a flag that indicates whether to delete the value(s) in the entry that match the old RDN.  The server may support renaming of entire directory subtrees.

An update operation is atomic: Other operations will see either the new entry or the old one.  On the other hand, LDAP does not define transactions of multiple operations: If you read an entry and then modify it, another client may have updated the entry in the meantime.  Servers may implement extensions&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zeilenga-ldap-txn-15 INTERNET-DRAFT LDAP Transactions draft-zeilenga-ldap-txn-15.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; that support this, though.

===Extended operations===
The Extended Operation is a generic LDAP operation that can define new operations that were not part of the original protocol specification. StartTLS is one of the most significant extensions.  Other examples include Cancel and Password Modify.

====StartTLS====
The StartTLS operation establishes [[Transport Layer Security]] (the descendant of [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]]) on the connection.  It can provide data confidentiality (to protect data from being observed by third parties) and/or data integrity protection (which protects the data from tampering).  During TLS negotiation the server sends its [[X.509]] certificate to prove its identity.  The client may also send a certificate to prove its identity.  After doing so, the client may then use [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer|SASL]]/EXTERNAL.  By using the SASL/EXTERNAL, the client requests the server derive its identity from credentials provided at a lower level (such as TLS).  Though technically the server may use any identity information established at any lower level, typically the server will use the identity information established by TLS.

Servers also often support the non-standard "LDAPS" ("Secure LDAP", commonly known as "LDAP over SSL") protocol on a separate port, by default 636.  LDAPS differs from LDAP in two ways:
1) upon connect, the client and server establish TLS before any LDAP messages are transferred (without a StartTLS operation) and
2) the LDAPS connection must be closed upon TLS closure.

Some "LDAPS" client libraries only encrypt communication; they do not check the host name against the name in the supplied certificate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shibboleth.net/community/advisories/secadv_20120227.txt Shibboleth Security alert 20120227]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abandon===
The Abandon operation requests that the server abort an operation named by a message ID.  The server need not honor the request.  Neither Abandon nor a successfully abandoned operation send a response.  A similar Cancel extended operation does send responses, but not all implementations support this.

===Unbind===
The Unbind operation abandons any outstanding operations and closes the connection.  It has no response.  The name is of historical origin, and is ''not'' the opposite of the Bind operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511#section-4.3 Tools.ietf.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Clients can abort a session by simply closing the connection, but they should use Unbind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511#section-5.3 Tools.ietf.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Unbind allows the server to gracefully close the connection and free resources that it would otherwise keep for some time until discovering the client had abandoned the connection. It also instructs the server to cancel operations that can be canceled, and to not send responses for operations that cannot be canceled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511#section-3.1 Tools.ietf.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==URI scheme==
An LDAP [[Uniform resource identifier|uniform resource identifier (URI)]] scheme exists, which clients support in varying degrees, and servers return in referrals and continuation references (see RFC 4516):

 ldap://host:port/DN?attributes?scope?filter?extensions

Most of the components described below are optional.
* ''host'' is the [[Fully qualified domain name|FQDN]] or IP address of the LDAP server to search.
* ''port'' is the [[network port]] (default port 389) of the LDAP server.
* ''DN'' is the distinguished name to use as the search base.
* ''attributes'' is a comma-separated list of attributes to retrieve.
* ''scope'' specifies the search scope and can be "base" (the default), "one" or "sub".
* ''filter'' is a search filter. For example, &lt;code&gt;(objectClass=*)&lt;/code&gt; as defined in RFC 4515.
* ''extensions'' are extensions to the LDAP URL format.

For example, "&lt;code&gt;ldap://ldap.example.com/cn=John%20Doe,dc=example,dc=com&lt;/code&gt;" refers to all user attributes in John Doe's entry in &lt;code&gt;ldap.example.com&lt;/code&gt;, while "&lt;code&gt;ldap:///dc=example,dc=com??sub?(givenName=John)&lt;/code&gt;" searches for the entry in the default server (note the triple slash, omitting the host, and the double question mark, omitting the attributes).  As in other URLs, special characters must be [[percent-encoding|percent-encoded]].

There is a similar non-standard &lt;code&gt;ldaps&lt;/code&gt; URI scheme for LDAP over SSL. This should not be confused with LDAP with TLS, which is achieved using the StartTLS operation using the standard &lt;code&gt;ldap&lt;/code&gt; scheme.

==Schema==
The contents of the entries in a subtree are governed by a [[logical schema|directory schema]], a set of definitions and constraints concerning the structure of the directory information tree (DIT).

The schema of a Directory Server defines a set of rules that govern the kinds of information that the server can hold. It has a number of elements, including:
* Attribute Syntaxes—Provide information about the kind of information that can be stored in an attribute.
* Matching Rules—Provide information about how to make comparisons against attribute values.
* Matching Rule Uses—Indicate which attribute types may be used in conjunction with a particular matching rule.
* Attribute Types—Define an [[object identifier]] (OID) and a set of names that may be used to refer to a given attribute, and associates that attribute with a syntax and set of matching rules.
* Object Classes—Define named collections of attributes and classify them into sets of required and optional attributes.
* Name Forms—Define rules for the set of attributes that should be included in the RDN for an entry.
* Content Rules—Define additional constraints about the object classes and attributes that may be used in conjunction with an entry.
* Structure Rule—Define rules that govern the kinds of subordinate entries that a given entry may have.

Attributes are the elements responsible for storing information in a directory, and the schema defines the rules for which attributes may be used in an entry, the kinds of values that those attributes may have, and how clients may interact with those values.

Clients may learn about the schema elements that the server supports by retrieving an appropriate subschema subentry.

The schema defines ''object classes''.  Each entry must have an objectClass attribute, containing named classes defined in the schema.  The schema definition of the classes of an entry defines what kind of object the entry may represent - e.g. a person, organization or domain.  The object class definitions also define the list of attributes that must contain values and the list of attributes which may contain values.

For example, an entry representing a person might belong to the classes "top" and "person". Membership in the "person" class would require the entry to contain the "sn" and "cn" attributes, and allow the entry also to contain "userPassword", "telephoneNumber", and other attributes. Since entries may have multiple ObjectClasses values, each entry has a complex of optional and mandatory attribute sets formed from the union of the object classes it represents. ObjectClasses can be inherited, and a single entry can have multiple ObjectClasses values that define the available and required attributes of the entry itself. A parallel to the schema of an objectClass is a [[Class (computer science)|class]] definition and an [[Instantiation (computer science)|instance]] in [[Object-oriented programming]], representing LDAP objectClass and LDAP entry, respectively.

Directory servers may publish the directory schema controlling an entry at a base DN given by the entry's subschemaSubentry operational attribute.  (An ''operational attribute'' describes operation of the directory rather than user information and is only returned from a search when it is explicitly requested.)

Server administrators can add additional schema entries in addition to the provided schema elements.  A schema for representing individual people within organizations is termed a [[white pages schema]].

==Variations==
A lot of the server operation is left to the implementor or administrator to decide.  Accordingly, servers may be set up to support a wide variety of scenarios.

For example, data storage in the server is not specified - the server may use flat files, databases, or just be a gateway to some other server.  Access control is not standardized, though there has been work on it and there are commonly used models.  Users' passwords may be stored in their entries or elsewhere.  The server may refuse to perform operations when it wishes, and impose various limits.

Most parts of LDAP are extensible. Examples: One can define new operations.  ''Controls'' may modify requests and responses, e.g. to request sorted search results.  New search scopes and Bind methods can be defined.  Attributes can have ''options'' that may modify their semantics.

==Other data models==
As LDAP has gained momentum, vendors have provided it as an access protocol to other services.  The implementation then recasts the data to mimic the LDAP/X.500 model, but how closely this model is followed varies.  For example, there is software to access [[SQL]] databases through LDAP, even though LDAP does not readily lend itself to this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/backends.html#SQL Openldap.org]&lt;/ref&gt; X.500 servers may support LDAP as well.

Similarly, data previously held in other types of data stores are sometimes moved to LDAP directories.  For example, Unix user and group information can be stored in LDAP and accessed via [[Pluggable Authentication Modules|PAM]] and [[Name Service Switch|NSS]] modules.  LDAP is often used by other services for authentication.

An example of such data model is the GLUE Schema,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.218.pdf Open Grid Forum : Project Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which is used in a distributed information system based on LDAP that enable users, applications and services to discover which services exist in a Grid infrastructure and further information about their structure and state.

==Usage==
An LDAP server may return referrals to other servers for requests that it cannot fulfill itself. This requires a naming structure for LDAP entries so one can find a server holding a given distinguished name (DN), a concept defined in the X.500 Directory and also used in LDAP. Another way of locating LDAP servers for an organization is a DNS [[SRV record|server record]] (SRV).

An organization with the domain example.org may use the top level LDAP DN &lt;code&gt;dc=example,dc=org&lt;/code&gt; (where ''dc'' means domain component).  If the LDAP server is also named ldap.example.org, the organization's top level LDAP URL becomes &lt;code&gt;ldap://ldap.example.org/dc=example,dc=org&lt;/code&gt;.

Primarily two common styles of naming are used in both X.500 [2008] and LDAPv3. These are documented in the ITU specifications and IETF RFCs. The original form takes the top level object as the country object, such as &lt;code&gt;c=US&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;c=FR&lt;/code&gt;. The domain component model uses the model described above. An example of country based naming could be &lt;code&gt;l=Locality, ou=Some Organizational Unit, o=Some Organization, c=FR&lt;/code&gt;, or in the US: &lt;code&gt;cn=Common Name, l=Locality, ou=Some Organizational Unit, o=Some Organization, st=CA, c=US&lt;/code&gt;.

This article provides a list of software products and cloud-based services used for email archiving.

[[Email archiving]] has several objectives: long-term preservation of knowledge, regulatory compliance, legal protection, etc. Those different goals may call for different solutions. For example, the [[Digital preservation#Email preservation|preservation]] of historical records may require a one-time [[Data migration|migration]] (change of format) and storage, while regulatory compliance generally calls for the systematic and continuous archival of messages, using a solution that provides storage and retrieval of email over extended time periods.

Different products have been developed to meet those needs. They may be offered as a standalone [[computer appliance]] (possibly in the form of a [[Virtual appliance|virtual machine]]), as installable software that can be deployed on the user's premises, or as a [[Cloud computing|cloud-based]] [[Software as a service|service]]. Those products may perform compression, de-duplication, encryption, indexing and advanced searching. They may work with a variety of email data sources (email systems and email storage file formats) and they may also support other types of messaging systems such as [[social media]] or [[instant messaging]]. Additionally, several [[collaborative software]] products (which commonly have messaging components) can also archive the data that they manage; however, those systems are not listed here since they generally do not archive third-party email data.

== Components ==

In addition to a [[backup]] system, several other components are necessary for a useful email archiving system:
* Message header/[[metadata]].
* Message body and related document attachments.
* Search and retrieval.
* Efficient storage.
* Reliable gathering of email flow.
* Policy enforcement, such as [[Retention period|retention policy]].
* [[Email archiving#Regulatory compliance|Compliance]] certification.

== Notable products and services ==
&lt;!--Products in this list should have a sourced article, meeting Wikipedia's notability requirements--&gt;

'''Mate Ujević''' (July 13, 1901 &amp;ndash; January 6, 1967) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] poet and encyclopedist.

==Life==
Ujević was born in Krivodol (part of [[Podbablje]] near [[Imotski]]) in the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] (present-day [[Croatia]]), finished gymnasium in [[Sinj]] and [[Classical Gymnasium in Split|Split]] and studied literature in [[Zagreb]]. He bachelored in [[Ljubljana]] and finished his doctoral dissertation on poet [[Jovan Hranilović]] in Zagreb. In 1941 he was named the director of the institute in charge of the [[Croatian Encyclopedia (1941–1945)|Croatian Encyclopedia]], on which he worked until May 1945.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

During [[World War II]], Ujević rescued Manko Berman, a Jewish encyclopedist and close friend, as well as two Jewish sisters from being deported to [[Jasenovac concentration camp]]. As a result of these actions, [[Yad Vashem]] later honored him as one of the [[Righteous among the Nations]].

In 1950 he began work with the [[Yugoslav Lexicographical Institute]] (today's [[Miroslav Krleža Lexicographical Institute]]) where he remained until his retirement in 1965. He died in [[Zagreb]].{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

'''Museum Lane''' runs between two of [[London]]'s leading museums in [[South Kensington]], namely the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] to the north and the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] (formerly the [[Geological Museum]]) to the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=London Sights: A Travel Guide to the Top 60 Attractions in London, England, UK | author=MobileReference | publisher=MobileReference.com | year=2010 | isbn=978-1607789314 | page=358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It runs to the west off [[Exhibition Road]] through a [[gate]]way connecting the two museums and connects with [[Queen's Gate]]. Opposite on Exhibition Road is the [[Henry Cole]] Wing of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. The [[Dana Centre]] is just to the north at the Queen's Gate end.

The lane provided access to the "Exhibition of Science" at the Science Museum in 1951, part of the [[Festival of Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Science for the Nation: Perspectives on the History of the Science Museum | editor-first=Peter J.

'''Paul Ellering''' (born August 22, 1953) is an American [[Manager (professional wrestling)|professional wrestling manager]] currently signed with [[WWE]] to a legends contract, [[professional wrestler]] and [[dog musher]]. Ellering spent most of his wrestling career managing [[the Road Warriors]] ([[Road Warrior Animal|Animal]] and [[Road Warrior Hawk|Hawk]]), working with them from 1983 to 1990 and again on occasion between 1992 and 1997. In addition to being their on screen manager he actually handled the team's affairs outside the ring as well, including contract negotiations and travel arrangements. Ellering and the Road Warriors were inducted into both the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum|Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] and the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in 2011. Five years later, in June 2016, he returned to the ring at [[NXT TakeOver: The End]] as the manager of [[The Authors of Pain]], a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] tag team making their debut.

Prior to becoming a manager he was a professional wrestler, but due to injuries retired in 1983 to become a full-time manager, only wrestling on special occasions. In the late 1990s he was involved in a storyline where he actually turned on the Road Warriors and managed [[Disciples of Apocalypse]] as they fought the Road Warriors. After retiring from full-time activity in wrestling, he raced in the [[Iditarod]] and [[John Beargrease Dog Sled Race]].

==Early life==
Before entering the [[wrestling]] business, Ellering was an accomplished [[powerlifter]], setting a world record in the deadlift at {{Convert|745|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://whatculture.com/wwe/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-paul-ellering?page=2, Retrieved November 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career===
Ellering was trained in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] at a camp run by [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) owner and promoter [[Verne Gagne]] and wrestler/trainer [[Eddie Sharkey]] in the mid 1970s. According to Ellering's RF Video shoot interview, of the thirty-plus trainees in the camp, only himself and later AWA mid-card wrestler [[Steve Olsonoski]] (a.k.a. Steve O) made it through the camp.  Ellering would later go on to wrestle in singles and tag teams for Gagne in the AWA, [[Bill Watts]]'s Mid-South promotion, and for Jerry Jarrett's Memphis promotion, where he was paired with manager [[Jimmy Hart]]. Ellering now known as '''"Precious" Paul Ellering'''  His notable feuds were with [[Jesse Ventura]] as a face, and as a heel with [[Jerry Lawler]] and [[Jimmy Valiant]], from whom he won the AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship.

===Mid-South Wrestling===
While wrestling for the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] in [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]], Ellering in 1982 severely injured his knee in a match with [[Robert Gibson (wrestler)|Robert Gibson]],  started doing workout segments with kids for Mid South re-injuring it after returning to the ring,but the injury ended his full-time wrestling career. Georgia booker [[Ole Anderson]] recognized his speaking ability, however, and gave him a job as a manager.&lt;ref name=tributes&gt;{{cite book |last=Meltzer|first=Dave|title=Tributes II: Remembering More of the World's Greatest Professional Wrestlers|isbn = 1-58261-817-8 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although primarily a manager, Ellering has stepped between the ropes as a competitor, notably at the 1987 NWA [[The Great American Bash (1987)|Great American Bash]] in which he joined the Road Warriors, [[Nikita Koloff]], and [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] to face [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]] and their manager [[James J. Dillon]] in the first ever [[WarGames match]]. Ellering would also face [[Theodore Long|Teddy Long]] in a 'Hair vs. Hair' match at the [[World Championship Wrestling]] [[Capital Combat]] event in 1990, coming away with a victory.

===World Wrestling Federation (1992; 1998–1999)===
Ellering is best known for managing [[The Road Warriors]], also known as the Legion of Doom, from 1981 until 1997 during their stints in the [[American Wrestling Association]], the [[National Wrestling Alliance]], [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]], and the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=hawk/&gt; Ellering was also the real-life manager for the team; he booked their matches, lined up their flights, set up hotel reservations, and kept track of their expenses.&lt;ref name=hawk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/10/19/pf-230771.html|title=Road Warrior Hawk dead at 45|author=Oliver, Greg|publisher=SLAM!

Throughout 1998 he managed the [[Disciples of Apocalypse]], who were then [[feud (professional wrestling)|feuding]] with the Legion of Doom; according to Ellering and Animal on the Road Warriors DVD, Ellering had a hard time working with another team against Hawk and Animal, and had difficulty ripping on his former team on the microphone. By the end of his second WWF run, though, he was back to managing the LOD, most notably on ''[[Sunday Night Heat]]'', during a tag-team battle royal for a shot at the tag titles later in the night at [[WrestleMania XV]], though they were unsuccessful.

The '''Royal Opera of Versailles''' ({{Lang-fr|'''{{Noitalic|Opéra royal de Versailles}}'''}}) is the main theatre and opera house of the [[Palace of Versailles]].  Designed by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]], it is also known as the '''Théâtre Gabriel'''.&lt;ref&gt;Givhan 2015, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-XYmBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129 p. 129].&lt;/ref&gt; The interior decoration by [[Augustin Pajou]] is constructed almost entirely of wood, painted to resemble marble in a technique known as [[faux marble]]. The excellent acoustics of the opera house are at least partly due to its wooden interior.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers 2004, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

The house is located at the northern extremity of the north wing of the palace.  General public access to the theater is gained through the two-story vestibule.  Some parts of the Opéra, such as the King's Loge and the King's Boudoir represent some of the earliest expressions of what would become known as [[Louis XVI style]].&lt;ref&gt;Marie, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]’s ''Persée'' — written in 1682, the year Louis XIV moved into the palace — inaugurated the Opéra on 16 May 1770 in celebration of the marriage of the dauphin — the future [[Louis XVI]] — to [[Marie Antoinette]].&lt;ref&gt;Verlet, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Opéra Royal can serve either as a theater for opera, stage plays, or orchestral events, when it can accommodate an audience of 712, or as a ballroom, when the floor of the orchestra level of the auditorium can be raised to the level of the stage.  On these occasions, the Opéra can accommodate 1,200.

==The French Enlightenment==
During the [[French Enlightenment]], the theatre became a place where political and social ideas were considered myths and superstitions were tested.  As more Enlightenment thinkers began to question the tenets of religion, many eighteenth-century citizens began to replace the pulpit with the stage, and looked to the theatre for their moral instruction as well as entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/specialcollections/exhibits/past/enlightenment/index.htm "UCB Libraries | Special Collections | The Enlightenment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404031639/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/specialcollections/exhibits/past/enlightenment/index.htm |date=2012-04-04 }} UCB Libraries | Home Page. N.p., n.d.  Retrieved 28 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The nobility had a lot to do with the uprising of theatre during this time.  [[Louis XIV]], who is known as the "Sun King" for playing the allegorical character of the sun in "The Ballet of the Night" in 1653,&lt;ref&gt;Gallo, Max, {{cite web |url=http://www.xoeditions.com/Louis-XIV,204 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308141828/http://www.xoeditions.com/Louis-XIV,204 |archivedate=2012-03-08 |df= }} "Louis XIV: The Sun King - French fiction de Max Gallo."

The Opera, which was built for [[Louis XV]], however, was not built until later.  His mistress, [[Madame de Pompadour|Madame de Pompadour]], patronized artists, actors, and musicians while bankrupting France.  Meanwhile, the aristocracy and church paid no taxes, and the bourgeoisie paid for the monarchy's tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Kuritz, Paul, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cS6JV4Z27DoC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;lpg=PA208&amp;dq=louisXVtheatre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f2ww_i4iC3&amp;sig=xR8BD7KisucxcNHzBaU_1jAE_bs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zB9rTc2yA4OClAf5xKH_AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=louisXVtheatre&amp;f=false "The Making of Theatre History"] Google Books.

==The Importance of Early Theatre in French Society==
Long before the Opera Royal was dreamed of, theatre was becoming an important part of French society. Beginning with the reign of Louis XIII, the frequency and regularity of theatrical performances had increased: the show was considered as much an entertainment as it was an expression of power &lt;ref&gt;Gousset, Jean-Paul, and Raphaël Masson. Versailles: L'opéra Royal. Paris: Artlys, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of it being an expression of power can be traced to one of Louis XIII's regents, [[Cardinal Richelieu]]. Richelieu wanted to create an image of the king (and France) that displayed well roundedness in all thing, a society who dabbled not only in politics or court, but music and art and theatre. He envisioned a force to lead the way, culturally. Attending a theatrical performance was quickly becoming a sign of stature, and though few permanent theatre spaces were created at this time, theatre found itself performed anyway. It is pertinent to note that until the final installation of the Versailles court, performances of operas and ballets, comedies and tragedies, were performed mainly in the gardens &lt;ref name="Gousset and Masson, pp. 17"&gt;Gousset and Masson, pp. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, however, spaces that were frequently used for performances would become specific performance spaces. In time the royal residences equipped themselves little by little with fixed theatres, although they often continued to use temporary structures and installations one could disassemble in various places: galleries, staircases, lounges, gardens &lt;ref name="Gousset and Masson, pp. 17"/&gt; These staged productions were important for many reasons. Little divertissements for the court, they also were at times used by royalty for their own reasons. Louis XIV's performance during the Ballet de la nuit, for example, was a statement of his power, his coming of age, and the fact that he was ready to take the throne with no regents. Indeed, his performance as Apollo is what earned him the name Sun King. Stage productions such as operas and ballets were important during the reigns of the Bourbon monarchs in France. Louis XIV in particular employed these and similar art forms extensively not only to entertain the noblemen in his court but also to promote his own self-image and the gloire of his country. Although he desired an Opera for his beloved Versailles, during the second half of Louis' reign, most operas, ballets and other staged divertissements for court and the public appeared indoors, in theatres or in other sites arranged as required for individual productions.&lt;ref&gt;Coeyman, Barbara. "Theatres for Opera and Ballet during the Reigns of Louis XIV and Louis XV." Early Music 18.1 (1990): 22-37. JSTOR. Web. 12 Jan. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporary theatres 1664 to 1674==
During the early years of his reign of [[Louis XIV]], theatres were often temporary structures, built for a particular event and destroyed after their use.  The first such theater was constructed for the fête of the ''Plaisirs de l’Île enchantée'', which was held in 1664.  In the area west of what is now the Bassin d’Apollon, a temporary theater was constructed in which [[Molière|Molière's]] ''Princesse d’Élide'' débuted on 8 May.  During this fête an additional theatre was erected inside the chateau for the presentation of three other plays by [[Molière]]: ''Les Fâcheux'', ''Le Mariage Forcé'', and ''Tartuffe'', which premiered in an incomplete, albeit contentious, form.  None of these theatres survived this fête.&lt;ref&gt;Verlet, pp. 54-59&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Grand Divertissement royal'' of 1668, which celebrated the end of the [[War of Devolution]], witnessed the construction of a luxurious temporary theater built in the gardens on the site of the future Bassin de Bacchus.  Constructed of papier-mâché, which was either gilded or painted to resemble marble and lapis lazuli, the theater seated 1,200 spectators who attended the debut of [[Molière|Molière's]] ''George Dandin'' on 18 July 1668.  As with the ''[[Plaisirs de l’Île enchantée]]'', this theater was destroyed shortly after the end of the fête.&lt;ref&gt;Verlet, pp. 70-72&lt;/ref&gt;

The third fête or, more accurately, a series of six fêtes - ''Les Divertissments de Versailles'' - were held in July and August 1674 to celebrate the second conquest of Franche-Comté.  The fête featured a number of theatrical productions that were staged throughout the grounds in temporary theaters.  On 4 July, [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully's]] ''Alceste'' was performed for the court in the Cour de Marbre; on 11 July, [[Philippe Quinault|Quinault's]] ''L'Églogue de Versailles'' was staged near the [[Subsidiary structures of the Palace of Versailles|Trianon de Porcelaine]]; eight days later, the Grotte de Thétys served as the setting for [[Molière|Molière's]] ''le Malade Imaginaire''; and [[Jean Racine|Racine's]] ''Iphigénie'' debuted on 18 August in a theater constructed in the Orangerie.&lt;ref&gt;Verlet, pp. 117-119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of permanent theatres==

===La salle de la Comédie, 1681 to 1769===
In spite of the need for a permanent theater at Versailles, it would not be until 1681 that a permanent structure would be built.  In that year, the Comptes des Bâtiments du Roi record payments for a theater that was constructed on the ground floor of the chateau between the corps de logis and the Aile de Midi.  The interior of the theater – known as the salle de la Comédie – contained a semicircle of row seating with loges set into the bays of the lateral walls.  On the south wall of the theater, abutting the wall of the Escalier des Princes, was the royal tribune, which contained a central room octagonal loge and two smaller loges on either side.&lt;ref&gt;Verlet, p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coeyman, "Theaters for Opera and Ballet during the reigns of Louis XIV and Louis XV", pp. 22-37&lt;/ref&gt;  The salle de la Comédie would function as a de facto permanent theater at Versailles until 1769, when it was destroyed in order to provide direct access to the gardens from the Cour Royale.&lt;ref&gt;Verlet, pp. 361-362&lt;/ref&gt;

===Small theatre, 1688 to 1703===
In 1688, [[Louis XIV]] ordered a small theater to be constructed in the north wing of the [[Grand Trianon]].  This structure was destroyed in 1703 to accommodate a new apartment for the king.

Because the salle de la Comédie was designed for stage plays, Versailles lacked a theatre in which more elaborate productions could be staged.  For larger productions, the Grand Manège (the covered riding arena) in the [[Grand Écurie]] was converted for more elaborate entertainments, but the space had limitations.  In 1685, Louis XIV approved plans for the construction of a larger permanent theater that could the more elaborate productions, such as pièces à machines.&lt;ref name="Verlet"&gt;Verlet, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;

The pièces à machines were theatrical presentations using ballet, opera, and special staging effects that required a theatre that could accommodate the complicated machinery used in the production of these plays.  The [[Salle des Machines]] at the [[Tuileries Palace]] in Paris, designed by [[Carlo Vigarani]], was the closest to Versailles. However, with [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] dislike for Paris – due in large part to his flight from the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]] in 1651 – and his increasing wish to keep his court at Versailles, the king approved the construction of a larger theater in 1685.  With a plan more grandiose than the theatre of the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]], the construction of this new theatre was much lauded by contemporary descriptions of Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;Félibien, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction was planned for the northern end of the Aile des Nobles, and was well underway when the [[War of the League of Augsburg]], which began in 1688, permanently halted construction.  It would not be until the reign of [[Louis XV]] that construction on this site would resume.&lt;ref name="Verlet" /&gt;

==Return to temporary theatres and conversions, 1729 to 1770==
[[File:Performance 1745 of La princesse de Navarre by Rameau - NGO3p859.jpg|thumb|240px|Premiere of Rameau's ''[[La princesse de Navarre]]'' on 23 February 1745 in the Grande Écurie, engraving by [[Charles-Nicolas Cochin]].]]
With the return of the court to Versailles in 1722, spaces used by [[Louis XIV]] were once again pressed into service for the needs of the court.  In 1729, as part of the festivities in celebration of the birth of the dauphin, a temporary theatre was constructed in the Cour de Marbre.  The salle de la Comédie and the Manège of the [[Grand Écurie]] continued to be used as they had during the reign of [[Louis XIV]].  

However, owing to [[Louis XV]] proclivity for more a more intimate theater, a number of temporary theaters known as the ''théâtres des cabinets'' were created.  These theaters were most often constructed in one of the rooms of the [[petit appartement du roi]], with the petite galerie being the most frequently used starting from 1746.  In 1748, the Escalier des ambassadeurs was converted into a theatre, in which the [[Madame de Pompadour|Marquise de Pompadour]] staged and acted in a number of plays.  Two years later, the theatre was dismantled when the Escalier des ambassadeurs was destroyed for the construction of the appartement de [[Princess Marie Adélaïde of France|Madame Adélaïde]].&lt;ref&gt;Verlet, pp. 366-369&lt;/ref&gt;

Acutely aware of the need for a larger and more permanent theater, as early as the 1740s [[Louis XV]], seriously considered reviving [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] plans for a permanent salle de spectacle to be constructed at the northern end of the Aile de Nobles.  However, owing to the [[Seven Years’ War]], construction would not be able to commence for nearly 20 years.  When fire destroyed the [[Grand Écurie]] and the theatre of the Manège in 1751, and since the salle de la Comédie had become an unfeasible venue due to its size for theatrical productions, [[Louis XV]] finally authorized [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] to design the Opéra in 1763.&lt;ref&gt;Verlet, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction of the Opéra, 1765 to 1770==

[[File:CLdF-BR0103 - Abel-François Poisson de Vandières, marquis de Marigny - Opéra Royal du Château de Versailles - augmentation des fonds - 1768.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Abel-François Poisson de Vandières|Marquis de Marigny]] is asking [[Étienne Maynon d'Invault]], [[Controller-General of Finances|contrôleur général des finances]], for a budget increase to complete the works on the Royal Opera of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] until spring [[1770]] («parvenir à l’achèvement de la salle de spectacle du Château de Versailles, avant le printemps de 1770»). Draft letter, [[October 31]], [[1768]].]]

Construction work on the Opéra began in earnest in 1765 and was completed in 1770. Gabriel reverted to an old design by J.H. Mansart and Gaspare Vigarani: the Salle des Ballets, at the far north end of the château, which had been abandoned at the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession.  The terminal pavilion of the north wing, intended for this, had been carried up to its full height only on the garden side; on the street side it had advanced no further than the foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Kalnein, Wend von. Architecture in France in the eighteenth century . New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, it represented the finest example in theatre design, having 712 seats, and it was the largest theatre in Europe. Today, it remains one of the few 18th century theaters to have survived to the present day.  [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel|Gabriel's]] design for the Opéra was exceptional for its time since it featured an oval plan.  As an economy measure, the floor of the orchestra level can be raised to the level the stage, thus doubling the floor space.  The transition from the auditorium to the stage is managed by the introduction of a giant order of engaged Corinthian columns, with a cornice ranging with the whole Ionic entablature.  The proscenium is formed by two pairs of columns, coupled in depth, with their entablature.  On either side two more pairs, more widely spaced, enclosed with three tiers of boxes.&lt;ref&gt;Ward 1926, p. {{page needed|date=August 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Breaking with traditional Italian-style theatres which stacked tiered boxes like chicken coops, two balconies ring the house, topped by an ample colonnade that seems to extend into infinity thanks to a play of mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitemouse.ru/photo/paris/versailles_chateau.wmb "France - Paris - Chateau de Versailles"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620004508/http://whitemouse.ru/photo/paris/versailles_chateau.wmb |date=2011-06-20 }}, White Mouse Burrow. White Mouse, RU, n.d. Retrieved 23 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was planned that the Opéra should serve not only as a theatre, but as ballroom or banqueting hall as well.&lt;ref&gt;Verlet, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre burned ten thousand candles in a single setting, therefore making it very expensive to rent the space out.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

It opened May 16, 1770, with Lully's ''Persée''.&lt;ref&gt;Praefcke, Andreas, [http://www.andreas-praefcke.de/carthalia/france/f_versailles_gabriel.htm "Carthalia - Versailles: Theatre Gabriel"], Homepage. N.p., n.d. Retrieved 23 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 1789, the ''gardes du corps du roi'' held a banquet to welcome the [[Flanders Regiment]], which had just arrived to strengthen protection for the royal family against the revolutionary rumblings that were being heard in Paris.  At this banquet, [[Louis XVI]], [[Marie-Antoinette]], and the [[Louis XVII of France|dauphin]] received the pledge of loyalty from these guards. Revolutionary journalist [[Jean-Paul Marat]] described the banquet as a counter-revolutionary orgy, with the soldiers ripping off the blue-white-red cockades they had been wearing and replacing them with white ones, the color that symbolized the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy.  In truth, there is no evidence of this act, and actual eyewitnesses and attendees, such as the queen's lady of the bedchamber [[Madame Campan]], record no such destruction of cockades.  This was the last event held in the Opéra during the [[Ancien Régime]].&lt;ref&gt;Verlet, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;

Built entirely of wood, which is painted in [[faux marble]] to represent stone, the Opéra has excellent acoustics and represents one of the finest examples of neo-classical decoration.  The theme of the decoration is related to [[Apollo]] and the Olympian deities.  The decoration of the Opéra was directed by [[Augustin Pajou]], who executed the bas-reliefs panels that decorate the front of the loges.  The ceiling features a canvas by [[Louis Jean-Jacques Durameau]] in which [[Apollo]] and the [[Muses]] are depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Verlet, pp. 379-380&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the excellent acoustics and the opulent setting, the Opéra was not often used during the reign of [[Louis XVI]], largely on grounds of cost. However, for those occasions when the Opéra was used, they became events of the day.   Some of the more memorable uses of the Opéra during the reign of [[Louis XVI]] included:

:5 May 1777: Revival of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau|Jean-Philippe Rameau’s]], ''Castor et Pollux'' for the visit of the Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], [[Marie-Antoinette|Marie-Antoinette’s]] brother.
:23 May 1782: Revival of ''la Reine de Golconde'' by [[Michel-Jean Sedaine]]; 
:29 May 1782: Revival of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Christoph Willibald Glück’s]] opera, ''Iphigénie en Aulide'' and the revival of [[Maximilien Gardel|Maximilien Gardel’s]] ballet ''Ninette à la Cour''; 
:8 June 1782: Dress ball held in honor of the visit of the comte and comtess du Nord, the [[Paul I of Russia|Grand Duke Paul]] and [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|Grand Duchess of Marie Feodorovna]] of Russia who were traveling incognito.&lt;ref&gt;Verlet, p. 555&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the festivities provided during the visit of Grand Duke Paul and Grand Duchess Marie, the Menus-Plaisirs recorded expenses at more than 200,000 livres for the second quarter of 1782.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:14 June 1784: Revival of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Glück’s]] ''Armide'' for the visit of [[Gustav III of Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Verlet, pp. 554-555&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Opéra after the Revolution==
Originally used only for royal ceremonies and extraordinary performances,&lt;ref&gt;Gousset and Masson pp. 59&lt;/ref&gt; this pinnacle of the Gabriel family's work began to be used less and less because of the immense cost to stage productions there. During the period of its usage, however, it was a beautiful example of royal lavishness and love for theatrical performances, and the fact that attending opera was once again the fashionable thing to do for the upper class, thanks in part to Queen Marie Antoinette's patronage, should not be underestimated.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd pp. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

When the royal family left Versailles in October 1789, the château and the Opéra were closed.  While the château did see some activity under [[Napoléon I]] (redecoration of the parts of the queen's apartment for the empress [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie-Louise]]) and [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], the Opéra did not reopen again until 1837, when [[Louis-Philippe]] redecorated the theater and presented [[Molière]]’s ''[[Le Misanthrope]]''.  During the state visit of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] the Opéra Royal was converted into a banquet room for a gala dinner on 25 August 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Verlet, p. 668&lt;/ref&gt;  This was to be one of the most elaborate events staged at Versailles during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]].

In 1872, during the [[Commune de Paris]], the Opéra was converted by [[Edmond de Joly]] for use by the [[Assemblée nationale]], who used the Opéra until 1876; between 1876 and 1879, the [[Sénat]] convened here.&lt;ref&gt;Today, when the Assemblée nationale and the Sénat meet in joint session, they do so at Versailles, not in Paris.  On these occasions, Versailles becomes the de facto capital of France.  To accommodate the members of the Sénat, the north wing of the château, in the part that faces the city of Versailles, over 300 apartments have been arranged for the private use by members of the upper house of France’s parliament.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Opéra Royal since 1950==
1952-1957 witnessed major restoration of the Opéra – generally considered one of the finest restoration projects undertaken at Versailles – when it was restored under the direction of [[André Japy]] to its 1770 state (Verlet, p.&amp;nbsp;384).  The Opéra officially reopened on 9 April 1957 in the presence of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom, with a presentation of Act II of [[Rameau]]’s ''[[Les Indes Galantes]]''.  Since its restoration, the Opéra has been used for state functions as well as a variety of operatic and musical events (Langlois, 1958). 

The Opéra was most recently closed in June of 2007 for an extensive two year renovation to bring the backstage and production areas up to safety standards.  During this latest renovation, led by chief architect of Historical Monuments [[Frédéric Didiera]], a new firewall was installed, the downstage timberframe stairs were restored to their original purpose, stage and lighting equipment were modernized, the technical grid was redone, dressing rooms were moved and brought up to modern standards, and adjacent spaces formerly given over to the [[Sénat]], including the Actor's Building, were reclaimed to once again accommodate the needs of performers, workshops, and offices. The Opéra reopened its doors in September of 2009, and has since carried out an expanded and ambitious regular series of operatic, balletic, and concert performances, especially celebrating the works of the Baroque and Classical periods most closely associated with the Opéra and the [[Palace of Versailles]].

Today, with its superb acoustics and magnificent décor, the Opéra represents one of the finest 18th century opera houses in Europe.  The importance of the Opéra Royal is directly linked to the history of the many theatres at Versailles and the history of theatrical stagings in 17th and 18th century France.

'''The Omnificent English Dictionary In Limerick Form''' (''The OEDILF'') is an open collaborative project to compile an English dictionary whose entries all take the form of [[Limerick (poetry)|limericks]]. The project was originally called the "Oxford English Dictionary in Limerick Form", but the ''OED''{{`s}} legal department advised against it. The site, launched in May 2004, has attracted over 2,100 writers from around the world, many of whom are active at any particular time. As of October 2018, the project has amassed more than 100,000 rhyming definitions. The project progresses alphabetically and is currently accepting only those words beginning with the letters ''Aa-'' through ''Go-''. The entire project is expected to take decades before being considered complete. An estimated completion date was added in 2011, which currently claims that 25 September 2076 will be the day they finally finish. Other OEDILFers believe that, due to the nature of our malleable language, they will merely be done with a "first edition" at that time and will move on to work on filling in all the meanings (many words have more than one) they may have omitted and all of the new words coined during the writing of this first edition.

''The OEDILF'' has been featured on National Public Radio in the U.S., on BBC Radio 4 in the UK, CBC radio in Canada, and in the pages of the ''Washington Post'', the Glasgow ''Herald'', and various other newspapers. It was also named one of PC Magazine's [https://www.pcmag.com/slideshow_viewer/0,1205,l=&amp;s=25087&amp;a=186715&amp;po=66,00.asp  Top 99 Undiscovered Websites of 2006].

==History==
The project was initiated in 2004 by Chris J. Strolin. With the assistance of contributors, by 2018 the project had amassed more than 100,000 rhyming definitions. Strolin has set a personal goal of writing at least one limerick definition per day; by November 2018 he had created 7,769 rhyming definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=News: There Was Once a Man Who Wrote Limericks...|publisher=[[Hamodia|Binyan]]|date=11 January 2018|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Pall Mall Gazette''''' was an evening newspaper founded in [[London]] on 7 February 1865 by [[George Murray Smith]]; its first editor was [[Frederick Greenwood]]. In 1921, ''[[The Globe (London newspaper)|The Globe]]'' merged into ''The Pall Mall Gazette'', which itself was absorbed into the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'' in 1923.

==History==
''The Pall Mall Gazette'' took the name of a fictional newspaper conceived by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]. [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] is a street in London where many [[gentlemen's club]]s are located, hence Thackeray's description of this imaginary newspaper in his novel ''[[The History of Pendennis]]'' (1848–1850):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We address ourselves to the higher circles of society: we care not to disown it—the Pall Mall Gazette is written by gentlemen for gentlemen; its conductors speak to the classes in which they live and were born. The field-preacher has his journal, the radical free-thinker has his journal: why should the Gentlemen of England be unrepresented in the Press?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under the ownership of George Smith from 1865 to 1880, with Frederick Greenwood as editor, the ''Pall Mall Gazette'' was a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] newspaper. Greenwood resigned in 1880 when the paper's new owner wished the paper to support the policies of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].

[[William Thomas Stead]]'s editorship from 1883 to 1889 saw the paper cover such subjects as [[child prostitution]]; their campaign helped get the government to increase the [[age of consent]] from 13 to 16 in 1885. This was one of the first examples of investigative journalism, and Stead was arrested for "unlawful taking of a child" (when he purchased thirteen-year-old [[Eliza Armstrong case|Eliza Armstrong]] from her mother for the meager price of [[Pound sterling|£]]5, to highlight how easy it was to buy children). It distressed the owner Thompson who dismissed Stead, and hired the handsome society figure
[[Henry Cust]], editor from 1892 to 1896, who returned the paper to its Conservative beginnings.

Thompson sold the paper to [[William Walforf Astor]] in 1896. Sir [[Douglas Straight]] was editor until 1909, followed by F.J. Higginbottom, under whom the paper declined. Circulation doubled between 1911-1915 under the editor J.L.Garvin, but the paper declined once more under its last editor D.L. Sutherland. It was absorbed into the [[Evening Standard]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Brake,Laurel; Demoor, Marysa ''Dictionary of Nineteenth-century Journalism in Great Britain and Ireland'', Academia Press, 2009, p478&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Several well-known writers contributed to ''The Pall Mall Gazette'' over the years. [[George Bernard Shaw]] gained his first job in journalism writing for the paper. Other contributors have included [[Anthony Trollope]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Charles Whibley]], [[Spencer Walpole|Sir Spencer Walpole]], [[Arthur Patchett Martin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050247b.htm Martin, Arthur Patchett (1851–1902) at the Australian Dictionary of Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; and Jamaican-born writer [[Eneas Sweetland Dallas]].

==References in popular culture==
''The Pall Mall Gazette'' is referred to in numerous other media works.  For example:
*It is referred to in Dr Watson's [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories (in "[[The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle]]" (1892)), as one of the newspapers Holmes sent an advertisement to.
*The ''Pall Mall Gazette'' is referred to in [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897); the reader is presented with an article describing the escape of a wolf from the Zoological Gardens.
*The ''Pall Mall Gazette'' is referred to in [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895); when the Time Traveller returns to [[London]] he sees that day's copy of the ''Pall Mall Gazette'' and knows he is back at his original starting point in time, as well as in his ''[[War of The Worlds]]'' (1898); when the narrator describes the "pre-Martian periodical called ''Punch''" as a prophecy.
*The ''Pall Mall Gazette'' is referred to in the 1979 film ''[[Time After Time (1979 film)|Time After Time]]'' in which a fictionalized [[H. G. Wells]], played by [[Malcolm McDowell]], is a time traveler who finds himself 90 years in his future, chasing [[Jack the Ripper]], played by [[David Warner (actor)]], through the city of [[San Francisco]] in the year 1979. While in a revolving restaurant, a new female friend, Amy (played by [[Mary Steenburgen]]), states that Wells strikes her as the type that, "Never reads a newspaper."  Wells replies, "I used to write for a newspaper, the 'Pall Mall Gazette.'" Time After Time was the first feature film directed by [[Nicholas Meyer]].
*In the [[Peru]]vian novel ''Vienen los Chilenos'' (''The Chileans are Coming'') written by [[Guillermo Thorndike]], the narrator describes how a Mr Petrie, an English gentleman travelling to [[Lima, Peru]], during the [[War of the Pacific|Saltpeter War]] in the 19th century, goes to the Phoenix Club located in that city. In this club, Englishmen and England-educated Peruvians meet and converse in English. The library is provided with American and British newspapers. Mr Petrie picks the ''Times'', the ''Pall Mall Gazette''', and some American newspapers, and reads several international news, including the attempt on the tsar's life, the famine in Ireland, the fighting between British and Afghan troops, and the cavalry attacks on the Sioux in the United States.

'''Truman Tennis Lowe''' is a [[Ho-Chunk]] [[sculptor]] and [[installation art]]ist living in [[Wisconsin]]. A professor of fine art at the [[University of Wisconsin]], Lowe is the former curator of contemporary art at the [[National Museum of the American Indian]]. He is known for large site-specific installation pieces utilizing natural materials.

==Background==

===Early life===

Lowe was born in [[Black River Falls, Wisconsin]] on the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin reservation to Mabel Davis and Martin Lowe. The youngest of six siblings, Truman was thirteen years younger than his sister, Irene. Mabel worked a variety of positions as a cook at the local Mission School and as a laundress. When at home in Black River Falls, Martin was a farmer as well as traveling as a seasonal worker, picking [[blueberries]] and [[cranberry|cranberries]] throughout the state. Surrounded often by close family, [[Winnebago language|Winnebago]] was the language spoken at home. As a child, Lowe attended school at the Black River Indian Mission until grade 6, switching in 1957 to the non-Native school in Black River Falls proper.&lt;ref name=Ortel&gt;Ortel, Jo ''Woodland Reflections: the art of Truman Lowe''. The University of Wisconsin Press, 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-299-19310-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1960 he worked during the summer at the [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin|Wisconsin Dells]], "playing Indian" amongst other Native performers during an evening performance for tourists. Other summers he worked for the Dells Chamber of Commerce, dressing up in an "Indian costume" to greet tourists as they walked the streets, and serving as a tour guide on the Dell's excursion boats, again in "costume". Lowe's experience as a "stereotype" tour guide would later influence aspects of his work.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

===Higher Education===
[[File:Wah-Du-Sheh (Bundle) (1997) by Truman Lowe.JPG|thumbnail|left|''[[Wah-Du-Sheh (Bundle)]]'' (1997) at the National Museum of the American Indian]]
Graduating from [[New Lisbon High School]] in the early 1960s, he applied and was accepted by the [[University of Wisconsin-La Crosse]]. After switching majors, he settled on [[art education]], studied all aspects of fine art media. Midway through his college experience he left in 1964 to work in a factory assembly line. In 1966 he married Nancy Knabe, whom he met when working in the Dells. A non-Native, of [[Germans|German]] and [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] descent, they were married at her family's church, Lyster Lutheran in Church Valley, Wisconsin. After their marriage, Nancy taught high school [[Home Economics]] while Lowe finished his undergraduate degree.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

Upon graduation, the couple moved to [[Valders, Wisconsin]] where, while creating artwork on his spare time, he taught elementary and secondary art classes. After teaching for two years, Lowe was accepted to the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] for fine arts, sponsored by a [[Ford Foundation]] fellowship. On October 2, 1971, his daughter Tonia Alison was born.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

Lowe on his reasons for returning to obtain his Masters:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''I knew how to teach, but I wanted access to current information, and as much information as I could get my hands on, in order to be able to better help my students.''&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Teaching career and National Museum of the American Indian===

After graduating in 1973, the Lowes moved to [[Emporia, Kansas]] where Truman was a visiting art lecturer at [[Emporia State University]], teaching only for about two years before returning to Madison, serving as assistant dean of Multicultural Programming at University of Wisconsin. In 1975, Nancy gave birth to their second child, son Martin Howard ("Kunu"), and that same year Lowe was given a joint appointment at Madison in the [[Native American studies]] program, as well as assistant professor of [[sculpture]], which he retained until 1988.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

While exhibiting and working on his art work, Lowe becomes tenured at University of Wisconsin-Madison, also being promoted to associate professor of art in 1984. After being promoted to professor of art in 1989, Lowe was elected as chair of the art department from 1992–1995.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

In 2000 Lowe was appointed the curator of contemporary art for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]]. Taking a leave of absence from the university, Lowe curated the inaugural exhibition featuring artists [[George Morrison (artist)|George Morrison]] ([[Ojibwe]]) and [[Allan Houser]] ([[Chiricahua]]), remaining as curator until 2008.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

==Fine art career==

===Family and Winnebago influence===

As a child, Lowe would collect rocks along the [[Black River (Wisconsin)|Black River]], scratching the river rocks together to create drawings by using the smaller rocks as [[pastels]] upon larger rocks. Eventually Lowe experimented with using rocks as pigment with &lt;!--"binder", perhaps linked to [[Paint#Binder.2C_vehicle.2C_or_resins]]?--&gt;substances such as [[motor oil]] and [[Vaseline]]. Disappointed with this process, he explored nature by creating drawings of "how snow sits on trees," and taking his study hall time in the high school art room.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

While growing up, his family created "craft" objects, which provided minor supplemental income to the family. His mother made [[Basket weaving|split-ash baskets]] while his father made the [[wood]]en handles for the baskets, and both of his parents created beadwork. Even the children learned the skills to create these family works, Lowe learning beadwork by kerosene lamp in the evening as a young man. These Lowe family creations were made for the tourist trade, delivering the freshly made creations by station wagon to the Wisconsin Dells, providing an offset from the seasonal farming positions the family participated in. During the summer, when the family was involved in seasonal work, they sold their crafts from a roadside stand they traveled with.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

Like many other Native artists Lowe was instilled with a degree of comfort regarding the creative practice of creation within the household. He wasn't aware of the Western idea of making a living full-time by art until he attended university. At university he fully delved into the concepts and creations revolving within [[Western art history]]; a social prestige regarding artistic creation, unlike his parents who would be considered "craftspeople."&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

Lowe's first artist interest was [[Michelangelo]] of whom he spoke:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Although my parents made a partial living weaving baskets, the two concepts of 'profession' and 'art' never came together in my mind until... college... [Then] I read everything I could get my hands on about Michelangelo....He was the first artist I'd met through my studies who went to work everyday and was paid by his patrons [and] employers for making art. Obviously, I learned encyclopedias from the work, but the practical lesson was that art could be a profession as well as a passion.''&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early works during college===

Lowe's early work was inspired heavily by the education he was receiving. Paintings showing exercises in abstraction and geometric patterns in the style of [[Frank Stella]] are seen in paintings like ''Suzy'' (1968) and [[color theory]] works such as ''Yellow Over Green'' and ''Yellow Over Red'' (1969), the latter two which have since been destroyed. Working in [[clay]], Lowe created egg-shaped sculptures that sat on coiled stands, ''Collection of Eggs'' and ''Unmatched Halves'' (c. 1968), giving a fantasy yet comic feel to his early experiments in art.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

Sculpture classes taught him about the power of the [[Line (geometry)|line]] in artworks and its placement in nature. Lowe studied the works of [[Brâncuși]], where he familiarized himself with geometry in sculpture, and [[Henry Moore]]'s works regarding scale in sculpture.&lt;ref name="Artnet"&gt;{{cite web | author=Victor M. Cassidy | year=2004 | title=Truman Lowe, Winnebago Artist | work=Features | publisher=Artnet | url=http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/features/cassidy/cassidy97-12-17.asp | accessdate= 24 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; And with the popularity of [[plastic]] in the 1960s Lowe expanded his mediums to complete 3-D works including a life-size toaster of sheet plastic made from a sandwich sealer, complete with pieces of toast in the slot, recalling the soft sculpture works of [[Claes Oldenburg]] at the time. His first undergraduate installation ''Laundry Bags'' (1969), showing a pile of clear plastic trash bags filled with colored rags piled in the corner of an exhibition space. This large-scale installation work would be a hallmark for Lowe's work in the future and throughout his career.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt; 
[[File:UntitledGoldBox1964.jpg|thumbnail|left|''Untitled'', 1964, by Larry Bell]]
Continuing to experiment with plastics, "I looked at all kinds of plastic: clear, different thickness, some milky. I also liked it because it was so big, so flexible, so easy to store, and so cheap."&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt; Experimenting with layering, Lowe used plastic as his canvas, drawing with black and color markers to create a transparent yet uniformed design upon the plastic. His simple minimalistic works represented the concepts of [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]], [[pictorial depth]], surface and illusion, reminiscent of works by [[Dorothea Rockburne]].&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

His M.F.A. exhibition in spring of 1973 showcased these experimental installations. Long plastic sheets cut into fringe, draped around or sandwiched between sheets of [[Plexiglas]] that hung from the ceiling with raw [[fluorescent light]] behind the plastic. Influenced by [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]]'s work to create a space where the work was indistinguishable from its surroundings, Lowe states about the exhibition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I arranged the pieces haphazardly in that space. I wanted to create an environment where one just moved from piece to piece without having the chance to stand back and think about the piece as a real object. I wanted to eliminate all that.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upon meeting George Morrison, Lowe found a role model. Morrison's Midwestern heritage and ability to blend in and out of Native and non-Native art communities provided a unique opportunity to explore involvement and separate from and within Native art worlds.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

===Red Power===
[[File:Student Vietnam War protesters.JPG|thumbnail|right|Students protesting the Vietnam war at University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1965.]]
During his return to obtain his Masters, the University of Wisconsin-Madison was a hotbed of activism regarding the [[Vietnam War]], while in [[Indian Country]] the [[Red Power movement]] was taking shape. Aware of the energy brewing in Native America, Lowe focused on school:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I didn't have the luxury - and I consider it a luxury - of being a protester because my focus was concentrated on getting information. I knew I wasn't going to be in that position for very long. I wanted to participate in gathering whatever information I could in the time I had, and I wanted to bring it all together, really to see what would happen. I needed time to work by myself.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite lack of time to focus on protesting and involvement in political movements, Lowe made a six-hour trip to hear Native activist and writer [[Vine Deloria, Jr.]] speak. Speaking about the need for Native peoples to take advantage of educational and economic opportunities in order to widen Native opportunities, Lowe chose to make that his mantra for his life choices and career.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

===Time in Kansas===

Moving to Kansas in 1973 for a teaching position, the Lowe family lived on a farm. During this time Lowe realized "[he] was really a Woodland Indian," owing to the lack of diversity in the landscape - he missed Wisconsin. However, Lowe's time in Kansas would not be without its benefits. Departing from plastics, he began to experiment with wood, and found natural objects. Creating assemblage pieces, abandoning synthetic materials completely. Living away from Wisconsin allowed Lowe to become aware of his heritage and environment, allowing him to re-embrace the nature of the Upper Midwestern environment and bring his own unique contemporary spin on skills learned within his family - woodworking and basketry.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

This move towards natural materials coincided with the popularity of the [[back-to-the-land movement]]. Lowe discovered the [[Foxfire (magazine)|Foxfire]] books as popular culture discovered the concept of the "ecological Indian".&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

===Return to Wisconsin===

Upon returning to Wisconsin and joining faculty at the University, Lowe's work began to become embraced by viewers and critics as contemporary Indian art. Through interviews Lowe connected each work to unique techniques and traditions of Native concepts of craft and fine art. His work in the late 1970s embraced his own "analysis of traditional Indian techniques," depicting war shields heavily decorated with feathers and often simple in their look. Celebrating the Native symbolism behind the feather as a rewarding, powerful object seen within many communities, it became an important part of his works and installations.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

===Storytelling works===

Like many contemporary Native American artists, Lowe chooses his medium to explore the stories and experiences of Native peoples, allowing his artwork to serve as a form of cultural survival.  The cosmology of the Winnebago people is told through a massive wooden sculpture ''Red Banks'' (1991), consisting entirely of wood at 12 × 37 × 8 feet. ''Red Banks'' serves as a visual analogy for oral tradition and myth, as well showing the framework upon which survival rests.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

At the premier of ''Red Banks'' Lowe embraced the importance of the artist as a storyteller and archivist of culture:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since Winnebago history is largely oral, tribal artists have a particularly important role to play in preserving tradition as well as making non-Indians aware of Winnebago culture.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other stories told through Lowe's work include the [[smallpox]] epidemic on the Black River Falls Indian Mission in 1901 (''Wooden Pole Construction'', 1983), serving as what has been described a "contemporary version of the mnemonic device," an idea that flows throughout his entire catalog of work. Personal stories are also reflected on through works like ''Feather Tree'' (1990), which honors his grandmother and the land she lived in. Lowe's work has also flowed into two dimensional drawings, where he has chosen to honor his mother's legacy.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

[[File:Chipoteke.jpg|thumbnail|left|Four Winnebago women under a structure commonly seen as an influence in Lowe's work, from the Wisconsin Historical Society]]

===Preserving historical Native aspects===

Many of Lowe's works also embrace historically traditional works of Native peoples from the Winnebago, Woodland, and other Native American groups. The ''Headdress Series'' formed out of his interest in traditional [[Plains Indian]] regalia and a collection of pedestal and large scale sculptures incorporated the architecture of early shelters from the Woodlands communities. Many of his works have also incorporated other traditional Native objects frequently found within museum collections such as the work ''Cradle Board'' (1977–78) where Lowe used photographs found in the [[Wisconsin State Historical Society]] collections to serve as inspirations and putting his own twist on the concept of a [[cradle board]].  Many of the images from the historical society served as inspiration and research for his work, especially with housing and general community living in Winnebago communities and beyond.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

Primitive housing and structures served as a way for Lowe to reflect on the disappearance of cultures in time, memory and history by way of an aesthetic. Their naked and simple—yet complexly built—designs reflect a "ghost like" presence of the past.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt; In 1986 Lowe reflected on his sculpture work: "My real interest is structures, the sculptural aspect of primitive structures...what intrigues me is that something is very primitive yet at the same time, very universal."&lt;ref name=Ziebarth&gt;Ziebarth, Jane ''Art Comes Naturally''. Wisconsin State Journal. 3 April 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Small and large installations began to emerge in Lowe's work depicting higher conceptions influenced by his son's interest in [[astronomy]]. Works such as the ''Solstice'' series and ''Skychart'' series depict abstract astrological charts and images inspired by the exploration of peoples to new areas and regions with guidance from the sky.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

==Major works and symbols==

===Red Ochre Series===

In 1991 Lowe launched the first of site specific installations in a series called ''Red Ochre''. The first of the series, shown in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], examined [[anthropology|anthropological]] theories about human migration and early North American settlement, inspired by ancient burial sites and death rites. Further examinations of his work reveal the ideas of blending cultures, rituals and migration through time.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

In 1993 the second installation was placed at the [[Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art]] in Indianapolis, Indiana. Lowe's work incorporated images of [[rock art]], examining once again how cultures migration paths crossed by way of unifying natural artistic venues, with rock art serving as communication devices for cultures worldwide. In this work, Lowe invited the public to assist in the construction of the work to ensure the relevance of the piece.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;
[[File:Canoe pictograph.jpg|thumbnail|right|Rock art of a canoe - two themes seen within Lowe's artwork, from [[Quetico Provincial Park]], Ontario, Canada]]
Both expansive installations include the use of natural materials such as saplings, as well as brown paper, providing a rock like or textured look to selected mediums. However, both pieces were dramatically different, with the Eiteljorg work focusing heavily on murals and wall constructs, and the Atlanta work focusing on an exploratory forest-like environment.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

===Canoes===

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I have a religion, it must be canoeing...I canoe wherever there's water. It puts me in a totally different state of mind and provides all I need to exist. - Truman Lowe&lt;ref name="Artnet"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

A classic symbol of Native America, the [[canoe]] has become a notable object scene throughout Lowe's work. A canoeist by recreation, Lowe attempts to reach beyond stereotypes and classic imagery by using the iconic canoe in his work. He also embraces his fascination with primitive structures, seeing the canoe both as a shelter and as a vehicle. Many of the canoes appear like [[wigwam]]s; constructed wooden skeletons of various shapes and sizes, with curved aspects. The canoe is also represented mnemonically in selected works by way of highly constructed small sculptures.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

The canoes are symbolic of journeys, from birth to death. The canoe's [[vaginal]] design and transportation characteristics provide it both male and female aspects in Lowe's eyes, "vehicle and vessel".&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

===Water===
[[File:Truman Lowe Water Whispers.jpg|thumbnail|left|''Water Whispers'', 2005, in the collection of the Eiteljorg Museum]]
Water is seen throughout many of Lowe's works, including the canoes. Again, Lowe works in large scale installations and smaller sculptures. In the ''Water Spirits,'' series, Lowe states "the ''Water Spirits'' pieces are really an effort to show some respect for natural forces as well as what we would call spiritual forces.'' Wood and debris combine to reflect seasonal changes, the fragility of these natural environments and the importance of the flow of water.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

In 1992 Lowe was commissioned by the [[Minnesota Arts Commission]] for [[Cloquet Community College]]. The sculpture sits within a large grouping of pine trees, made of polished [[stainless steel]] it hovers a foot and a half above the ground, intertwining through the trees like a stream. Utilized as a bench, large rocks are also placed underneath from nearby riverbeds to be glimpsed at under thin slits cut into the steel to represent the flowing of the water.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

Other notable works of the series include ''Ottawa'' (1992), which represents the steep slopes where water rapidly flows amongst the three rivers near the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in [[Ottawa, Canada]]. Rows of unfinished strips of line "flow" in gradation representing a fast moving stream or roller coaster. An open structure that reflects the relationship between the river and its surroundings, it has been described as a high [[modernist]] work.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

[[Shoreline]]s and [[streambed]]s are also found in his sculptures. ''Water Mound'' (1994), a massive installation of wood, it represents [[sandbar]]s that form during the changes of river systems. The river's edge is shown in other large installations such as ''Maumee Reflection'' (1987), depicting Lowe's vision of when land meets water at the confluence of three rivers near [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], where the work was displayed.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

Many of the water related works also depict aspects of basketry, with splints of wood which are usually used to form the shape of the basket. Again, Lowe shows another connection to his family and community creations, inspired by his mother's basketry work.&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

===Grids===
In the tradition of modernism, Lowe uses the grid in selected works. Reflective of works by [[Sol LeWitt]] and [[Eva Hesse]], grids are used as representations of mapping systems—a way to describe environments and landscapes in a two-dimensional way. Native American communities were not traditionally map makers, unlike Europeans and the major land-surveying programs that would invade young America. An important part of the [[Manifest Destiny]] ideal, the grid was used systematically to distribute equal land to colonists. The grid is also symbolic of archeological digs and is seen in major landscape works by Lowe such as ''Effigy I'' (1984).&lt;ref name=Ortel/&gt;

===Wood===
Many of Lowe's constructions are created from [[willow]] [[sapling]]s, often the only material used in installations. Lowe collects the saplings from Wisconsin farms in the summertime, gathering a large amount, peeling off the bark, and sanding the resulting sticks to bring out the white in the sapling. Flexibility and strength are essential with willow, allowing Lowe to bend and manipulate the wood to his needs.&lt;ref name="Artnet"/&gt;

The '''U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals''' are seven controversial military training manuals which were declassified by the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in 1996. In 1997, two additional CIA manuals were declassified in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request filed by ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''. The manuals in question have been referred to by various media sources as the "torture manuals".&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{cite journal | first =Arthur | last =Jones |author2=Dorothy Vidulich | date =October 4, 1996 | title =Pentagon admits use of torture manuals: training books used for Latin Americans at Ft.

==Army manuals==
These manuals were prepared by the U.S. military and used between 1987 and 1991 for intelligence training courses at the U.S. Army [[School of the Americas]] (SOA). Some of the material was similar to the older CIA manuals described below.  The manuals were also distributed by Special Forces Mobile Training Teams to military personnel and intelligence schools in [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name="bouvier"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Globalization of U.S.-Latin American Relations: Democracy, Intervention, and Human Rights| author = Virginia Marie Bouvier | year = 2002 | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | page = 132 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xFtVfpcFYuMC&amp;pg=PA132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "abu"&gt;{{cite journal | first =James | last =Hodge | authorlink = |author2=Linda  Cooper | date =November 5, 2004 | title =Roots of Abu Ghraib in CIA techniques | journal =[[National Catholic Reporter]] | url =http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2004d/110504/110504a.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080113141641/http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2004d/110504/110504a.php | archivedate = 2008-01-13 }} &lt;sup&gt;See https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-124862830/roots-of-abu-ghraib-in-cia-techniques-50-years-of Also google the whale.to site.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Gill | first =Lesley | authorlink = | year =2004 | title =The School of the Americas: Military Training and Political Violence in the Americas | publisher =Duke University Press | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sJmPU-9zEPwC&amp;pg=PA49 | isbn =0-8223-3392-9}} p. 49 &lt;br&gt;*{{cite journal | first =Dana | last =Priest| date =September 21, 1996 | title =U.S. Instructed Latins On Executions, Torture; Manuals Used 1982-91, Pentagon Reveals | journal =[[The Washington Post]] | pages =Section: A Pg.

The Pentagon press release accompanying the release stated that a 1991-92 investigation into the manuals concluded that "two dozen short passages in six of the manuals, which total 1169 pages, contained material that either was not or could be interpreted not to be consistent with U.S. policy."

The Latin America Working Group criticized this: "The unstated aim of the manuals is to train Latin American militaries to identify and suppress anti-government movements. Throughout the eleven hundred pages of the manuals, there are few mentions of democracy, human rights, or the rule of law. Instead, the manuals provide detailed techniques for infiltrating social movements, interrogating suspects, surveillance, maintaining military secrecy, recruiting and retaining spies, and controlling the population. While the excerpts released by the Pentagon are a useful and not misleading selection of the most egregious passages, the ones most clearly advocating torture, execution and blackmail, they do not provide adequate insight into the manuals' highly objectionable framework. In the name of defending democracy, the manuals advocate profoundly undemocratic methods."

After this 1992 investigation, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] discontinued the use of the manuals, directed their recovery to the extent practicable, and destroyed the copies in the field. U.S. Southern Command advised governments in Latin America that the manuals contained passages that did not represent U.S. government policy, and pursued recovery of the manuals from the governments and some individual students.&lt;ref name = "fact"&gt;{{cite journal

Soon after, the U.S. Army issued the [[FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation]] manual, which was used until September 2006, when it was superseded by [[FM 2-22.3, Human Intelligence Collector Operations]].

==CIA manuals==

[[File:US Senate Report on CIA Detention Interrogation Program.pdf|thumb|The [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture|US Senate Report on CIA Detention and Interrogation Program]] that details the use of torture]]

The first manual, "KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation", dated July 1963, is the source of much of the material in the second manual. KUBARK was a U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] [[cryptonym]] for the CIA itself.&lt;ref name="NSA" /&gt; The [[cryptonym]] KUBARK appears in the title of a 1963 CIA document ''KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation'' which describes [[interrogation]] techniques, including, among other things, "coercive counterintelligence interrogation of resistant sources". &lt;!--cryptonym sentence not sourced--&gt;This is the oldest manual, and describes the use of abusive techniques, as exemplified by two references to the use of electric shock, in addition to use of threats and fear, sensory deprivation, and isolation.&lt;ref name = "NSA"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second manual, "Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual - 1983", was used in at least seven U.S. training courses conducted in Latin American countries, including Honduras, between 1982 and 1987. According to a [[Classified information|declassified]] 1989 report prepared for the Senate intelligence committee, the 1983 manual was developed from notes of a CIA interrogation course in Honduras.&lt;ref name = "balt"/&gt;

Both manuals deal exclusively with interrogation.&lt;ref name = "inter"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both manuals have an entire chapter devoted to "coercive techniques". These manuals recommend arresting suspects early in the morning by surprise, blindfolding them, and stripping them naked. Suspects should be held incommunicado and should be deprived of any kind of normal routine in eating and sleeping. Interrogation rooms should be windowless, soundproof, dark and without toilets.

The manuals advise that torture techniques can backfire and that the threat of pain is often more effective than pain itself. The manuals describe coercive techniques to be used "to induce psychological regression in the subject by bringing a superior outside force to bear on his will to resist." These techniques include prolonged constraint, prolonged exertion, extremes of heat, cold, or moisture, deprivation of food or sleep, disrupting routines, solitary confinement, threats of pain, deprivation of sensory stimuli, hypnosis, and use of drugs or placebos.&lt;ref name = "para"&gt;{{cite web

Between 1984 and 1985, after congressional committees began questioning training techniques being used by the CIA in Latin America, the 1983 manual went through substantial revision. In 1985 a page advising against using coercive techniques was inserted at the front of ''Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual''.  Handwritten changes were also introduced haphazardly into the text. For example, "While we do not stress the use of coercive techniques, we do want to make you aware of them and the proper way to use them", has been altered to, "While we deplore the use of coercive techniques, we do want to make you aware of them so that you may avoid them." (p. A-2) But the entire chapter on coercive techniques is still provided with some items crossed out.&lt;ref name = "balt" /&gt;

The same manual states the importance of knowing local laws regarding detention but then notes, "Illegal detention always requires prior HQS [headquarters] approval." (p. B-2)

The two manuals were completely declassified and released to the public in May 2004, and are now available online.&lt;ref name = "NSA" /&gt;

===The 1983 manual and Battalion 3-16===
In 1983, the Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual - 1983 methods were used by the U.S.-trained Honduran [[Battalion 3-16 (Honduras)|Battalion 3-16]].&lt;ref name="abu"/&gt;

On January 24, 1997, ''KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation'' and ''Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual - 1983'' were declassified in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request filed by the [[Baltimore Sun]] in 1994. The Baltimore Sun was investigating "kidnapping, torture and murder" committed by the Honduran Battalion 3-16 death squad. The documents were released only after the Baltimore Sun had threatened to sue the CIA.&lt;ref name = "balt"&gt;{{cite journal

}}p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

In the June 11 to 18, 1995 four-part series, ''The Baltimore Sun'' printed excerpts of an interview with Florencio Caballero, a former member of Battalion 3-16. Caballero said CIA instructors taught him to discover what his prisoners loved and what they hated, "If a person did not like cockroaches, then that person might be more cooperative if there were cockroaches running around the room"&lt;ref name = "balt"/&gt; The methods taught in the 1983 manual and those used by Battalion 3-16 in the early 1980s show unmistakable similarities. In 1983, Caballero attended a CIA "human resources exploitation or interrogation course," according to declassified testimony by [[Richard Stolz]], who was the deputy director for operations at the time, before the June 1988 [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]. The manual advises an interrogator to "manipulate the subject's environment, to create unpleasant or intolerable situations."{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The manual gives the suggestion that prisoners be [[deprived of sleep]] and food, and made to maintain rigid positions, such as standing at attention for long periods. Ines Consuelo Murillo, who spent 78 days in Battalion 3-16's secret jails in 1983, said she was given no food or water for days, and one of her captors entered her room every 10 minutes and poured water over her head to keep her from sleeping.&lt;ref name = "balt"/&gt;

The "Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual -- 1983" gives the suggestion that interrogators show the prisoner letters from home to give the prisoner the impression that the prisoner's relatives are in danger or suffering.&lt;ref name = "balt"/&gt;

''The Baltimore Sun'' reported that former Battalion 3-16 member Jose Barrera said he was taught interrogation methods by U.S. instructors in 1983: "The first thing we would say is that we know your mother, your younger brother. And better you cooperate, because if you don't, we're going to bring them in and rape them and torture them and kill them." &lt;ref name = "balt"/&gt;

'''VMmark''' is a freeware [[virtual machine]] [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] software suite from [[VMware]], Inc.  The suite measures the performance of virtualized servers while running under load on a set of physical hardware.  VMmark was independently developed by VMware.

== Technical overview ==
In order to measure the efficiency of the virtualization layer - the [[hypervisor]] - the suite must run several virtual machines (VMs) simultaneously.  Each VM is configured according to a template, three of which are provided with the VMmark software.  The templates mimic typical software applications found in corporate [[data center]]s, such as [[Mail transfer agent|email server]]s, [[database server]]s, and [[Web server]]s.  The VMmark software collects performance statistics that are relevant to each type of application, such as commits per second for database servers, or page accesses per second for web servers.&lt;ref name=vmmark_wp_vmw&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vmware.com/pdf/vmmark_intro.pdf |title=VMmark: A Scalable Benchmark for Virtualized Systems |format=PDF |publisher=VMware, Inc. |pages=6&amp;ndash;7 |date=2006-09-25 |accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VMs are grouped into logical units called "tiles".  When evaluating a system's performance, the VMmark software first calculates a score for each tile, culled from the performance statistics produced by each VM, and aggregates the per-tile scores into a final number.&lt;ref name=vmmark_wp_vmw /&gt;

== Software components ==
VMmark uses a mixture of [[free software|free/open source]] and [[proprietary software]] in its virtual machine templates, such as [[Apache HTTP Server]] for Web servers and [[Microsoft Exchange Server]] for email servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=VMmark System Requirements - Software Licensing Considerations |url=http://www.vmware.com/products/vmmark/requirements.html |publisher=VMware, Inc. |accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry reception ==
Use and reporting of results have been consistent since introduction, with 20 results posted between June 1, 2013 and June 1, 2014 out of a total of 81 results posted since its introduction at the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=VMmark Reported Results  |url=http://www.vmware.com/a/vmmark/ |publisher=VMware, Inc. |accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2008|alt=As of May 2008}}, four computer system vendors ([[Dell|Dell Computer]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[IBM]], and [[Sun Microsystems]]) had submitted VMmark benchmark results to VMware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vmware.com/products/vmmark/results.html |title=VMmark Results |publisher=VMware, Inc. |accessdate=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

By October 2009 that had increased to 10 vendors (HP, NEC, IBM, Unisys, Sun, Dell, [[Inspur]], Lenovo, Fujitsu and Cisco)

The '''''Annals of the Joseon Dynasty''''' (also known as '''''The True Record of the Joseon Dynasty''''') are the annual records of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] of Korea, which were kept from 1413 to 1865. The annals, or ''sillok'', comprise 1,893 volumes and are thought to cover the longest continual period of a single dynasty in the world.  With the exception of two ''sillok'' compiled during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|colonial era]], the ''Annals'' are the 151st [[National treasures of Korea|national treasure of Korea]] and listed in [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World]] registry.

The Annals has since 2006 been digitalized by the [[National Institute of Korean History]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=E-Annals Bring Chosun History to Everyman|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2006/01/27/2006012761013.html|accessdate=16 October 2012|newspaper=Chosun Ilbo|date=27 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and available on the internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Annals of the Choson Dynasty|url=http://sillok.history.go.kr/main/main.jsp|website=The Annals of the Choson Dynasty|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Modern Korean]] translation in [[Hangul]] and original text in [[Classical Chinese]].

In January 2012, the [[National Institute of Korean History]] announced that they are to translate the Annals into English by the year 2033.  They plan to start work in 2014 with an initial budget of  {{SK won|500 million}}, but estimate that a budget of {{SK won|40 billion}} is needed to complete the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Annals of the Joseon Dynasty to be translated|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2947100|accessdate=29 March 2013|newspaper=Joongang Daily|date=16 January 2012|author=Lee Sun-min|author2=Ha Hyun-ock|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411045818/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2947100|archivedate=11 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Compilation==
During the reign of a king, professional historiographers maintained extensive records on national affairs and the activities of the state.  They collected documents and wrote daily accounts that included state affairs as well as diplomatic affairs, the economy, religion, meteorological phenomena, the arts, and daily life, among other things.  These daily accounts became the ''Sacho'' ("Draft History").  Great care was taken to ensure the neutrality of the historiographers, who were also officials with legal guarantees of independence.  Nobody was allowed to read the ''Sacho'', not even the king, and any historiographer who disclosed its contents or changed the content could be punished with beheading. These strict regulations lend great credibility to these records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Summary of the Annals of the Choson Dynasty

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Yet at least one king, tyrannical [[Yeonsangun]] looked into the Annals, and this led to the [[Korean Literati Purges|First Literati Purge of 1498]], in which one recorder and five others were cruelly executed because of what was written in the ''Sacho''.  This incident led to greater scrutiny to prevent the king from seeing the ''Annals''.  In the Later Joseon period when there was intense conflict between different political factions, revision or rewriting of ''sillok'' by rival factions took place, but they were identified as such, and the original version was preserved.   
 
The original recorders recorded every word and act of the king in the ''Sacho'' although not all details were included in the final version. For instance, [[Taejong of Joseon|King Taejong]] fell from a horse one day and immediately told those around him not to let a recorder know about his fall.  A recorder wrote both Taejong's fall and his words not to record it. In another instance, Taejong was recorded to complain about a recorder who eavesdropped on him behind a screen and followed him to a hunt behind a disguise.  

Upon the death of a king and the coronation of his successor, the ''Sillokcheong'' ("Office for Annals Compilation") used the ''Sacho'' to begin compilation of his annals.

The ''Annals'' of the first three kings of the Joseon dynasty, those of [[Taejo of Joseon|Taejo]] (r.1392–1398), [[Jeongjong of Joseon|Jeongjong]] (r.1399–1400), and [[Taejong of Joseon|Taejong]] (r. 1401–1418), were hand-written manuscripts. Later annals, from the Annals of [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|Sejong]] (r. 1418–1450) onwards, were printed with movable metal and wooden type, which was unprecedented in the making of annals in Japan and China. 

Four separate repositories were established in [[Blue House|Chunchugwan]], [[Chungju]] County, [[Jeonju]] County, and [[Seongju County]] to store copies of the ''Annals''.  All but the repository in Jeonju were burned down during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Imjin wars]].  After the war, five more copies of the ''Annals'' were produced and stored in Chunchugwan and the mountain repositories of [[Myohyang-san]], [[Taebaeksan]], [[Odaesan]], and [[Manisan (Incheon)|Mani-san]].  The Chunchugwan copy was lost in 1624, due to the treason of [[Yi Gwal]]. Part of the Mani-san copy was lost during the [[Second Manchu invasion of Korea|Manchu invasion]] (1636), and the surviving volumes moved to [[Jeongjok-san]] in 1678. The Myohyang-san copy was moved to [[Jeokseong-san]] in 1633.  During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|colonial era]], the Japanese moved the Odae-san copy to [[Tokyo University]], but most of the copy was soon lost in the [[Great Kantō earthquake]] of 1923. 47 books have remained, and in July 2006, the copy returned to South Korea. 

The ''Annals'' are written in [[Classical Chinese]]; they were translated into modern Korean in the 1980s in [[North Korea]] and in 1994 in [[South Korea]]. Parts of the ''Annals of the Joseon Dynasty'' have been scanned by [[Seoul National University]] and are available online.

==Excluded annals from the collection==
The annals of the last two Joseon rulers, the emperors [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Gojong]] and [[Emperor Sunjong of the Korean Empire|Sunjong]], have been excluded from the ''Annals of the Joseon Dynasty''.  Written during the Japanese occupation of Korea, ''Gojong sillok'' and ''Sunjong sillok'' are regarded as "unreliable documents" by Korean academics because of the influence of Japanese officials on their compilation as well as the falsification of historical events.  Although they have been included in the [[National Institute of Korean History]]'s [[Korean language|modern Korean]] translation as the ''Annals of the Last Two Emperors of the Joseon Dynasty'', they are not considered part of the ''Annals of the Joseon Dynasty'' and are not included in the National Treasures of South Korea or UNESCO's Memory of the World register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
