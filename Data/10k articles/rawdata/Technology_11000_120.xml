      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4767">In telecommunications, '''6b/8b''' is a line code that expands 6-[[bit]] codes to 8-bit symbols for the purposes of maintaining [[DC bias|DC-balance]] in a communications system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Each 8-bit output symbol contains 4 zero bits and 4 one bits, so the code can, like a [[parity bit]], detect all single-bit errors.

The number of [[binomial coefficient]] 8-bit patterns with 4 bits set is &lt;math&gt;\tbinom 84&lt;/math&gt; = 70.  Further excluding the patterns &lt;code&gt;11110000&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;00001111&lt;/code&gt;, this allows 68 coded patterns: 64 data codes, plus 4 additional control codes.

==Coding rules==
The 64 possible 6-bit input codes can be classified according to their disparity, the number of 1 bits minus the number of 0 bits:

{|class=wikitable style="text-align:center"
! Ones !! Zeros !! Disparity !! Number
|-
| 0 || 6 || −6 ||  1
|-
| 1 || 5 || −4 ||  6
|-
| 2 || 4 || −2 || 15
|-
| 3 || 3 ||  0 || 20
|-
| 4 || 2 || +2 || 15
|-
| 5 || 1 || +4 ||  6
|-
| 6 || 0 || +6 ||  1
|} 
The 6-bit input codes are mapped to 8-bit output symbols as follows:
* The 20 6-bit codes with disparity 0 are prefixed with &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;''Example: 000111 → '''10'''000111''&lt;br/&gt;''Example: 101010 → '''10'''101010''
* The 14 6-bit codes with disparity +2, other than &lt;code&gt;001111&lt;/code&gt;, are prefixed with &lt;code&gt;00&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;''Example: 010111 → '''00'''010111''
* The 14 6-bit codes with disparity −2, other than &lt;code&gt;110000&lt;/code&gt;, are prefixed with &lt;code&gt;11&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;''Example: 101000 → '''11'''101000''
* The remaining 20 codes: 12 with disparity ±4, 2 with disparity ±6, &lt;code&gt;001111&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;110000&lt;/code&gt;, and the 4 control codes, are assigned to codes beginning with &lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt; as follows:

|-
| −2 || &lt;code&gt;110000&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;01110'''1'''00&lt;/code&gt;
| +2 || &lt;code&gt;001111&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;01001'''0'''11&lt;/code&gt;

|rowspan=2|
|-
| &lt;code&gt;K 010101&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;01010101&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;K 101010&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;01101010&lt;/code&gt;
|}

Obviously, no data symbol contains more than four consecutive matching bits, and because the patterns &lt;code&gt;11110000&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;00001111&lt;/code&gt; are excluded, no data symbol begins or ends with more than three identical bits.
Thus, the longest run of identical bits that will be produced is 6.  (I.e. this is a (0,5) [[Run length limited|RLL code]], with a worst-case [[running disparity]] of +3 to −3.)

Any occurrence of 6 consecutive identical bits constitutes a comma sequence or sync mark or [[syncword]]; it identifies the symbol boundaries precisely.
Those 6 bits straddle the inter-symbol boundary with exactly 3 of those identical bits at the end of one symbol, and 3 of those identical bits at the start of the following next symbol.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6308">'''Advanced Mezzanine Cards''' are [[printed circuit board]]s (PCBs) that follow a [[specification]] of the [[PICMG|PCI Industrial Computers Manufacturers Group (PICMG)]], with more than 100 companies participating. 

Known as AdvancedMC or AMC, the official specification designation is AMC.''x'' (see below). At the early days AMC is targeted to requirements for the next generation of "[[carrier grade]]" communications equipment. Nowadays it is used in nearly all kind of equipment demanding high flexibility, modularity and bandwidth. 

AMC are designed to work as standalone module, as hot pluggable module on any carrier card (base boards and system carrier boards in [[Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture|AdvancedTCA]] Systems) but also to plug as hot pluggable board into a backplane directly as defined by [[MicroTCA]] specification.

The AMC standard differs from other mezzanine card standards such as [[PCI Mezzanine Card]] (PMC), PCIexpress Mezzanine Card XMC and [[FMC – FPGA Mezzanine Card]] by the 0 degree instead of 90 degree orientation of its connector enabling hot plug of the AMC.

== AMC specifications ==
*AMC.0 is the "base" or "core" specification. The AdvancedMC definition alone defines a [[protocol (computing)|protocol]] agnostic connector to connect to a carrier card or a backplane. Intermediate revisions are known as engineering change notices, or ECNs.&lt;ref name="date"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.picmg.org/advanced-mezzanine-card-base-specification-amc-0-r2-0/|title=Advanced Mezzanine Card Base Specification AMC.0 R2.0|work=PICMG}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:R1.0 adopted January 3, 2005
:ECN-001 adopted June 2006 
:R2.0 adopted November 15, 2006
An AMC card can use proprietary [[LVDS]]-based signaling, or one of the following AMC specifications:
*AMC.1 [[PCI Express]] (and PCI Express Advanced Switching) ([[ratification|ratified]])
*AMC.2 Gigabit [[Ethernet]] and [[XAUI]] (ratified)
*AMC.3 Storage (ratified)
*AMC.4 Serial [[RapidIO]] (ratified)

== Sizes ==
There are six types of AMC cards ("''Module''") available. A ''Full-size'' Module is the most common, allowing up to 23.25&amp;nbsp;mm high [[electronic component|components]] (from centerline of PCB). A ''Mid-size'' Module allows component heights maxed at 11.65 to 14.01&amp;nbsp;mm (depending on board location). A ''Compact'' Module allows only 8.18&amp;nbsp;mm.

== AMCs used in AdvancedTCA (ATCA) system ==
To use AMCs in ATCA-systems a special carrier card known as ''hybrid'' or ''cutaway'' carrier is required to hold one Full-size Module or two Compact-size (see connectors below). Each height is paired with a width, ''single'' or ''double'', describing how many carrier slots the board fills. A double width card allows more component space, but does not provide any additional power or bandwidth because it only uses a single connector.

The [[pinout]] of the AMC [[electrical connector|connector]] on an ATCA-AMC carrier or Motherboard is fairly complex, with up to 170 [[signal trace|traces]]. There are four different lengths the traces can be, which allows [[hot swapping]] by knowing in advance which traces will become active in which order upon insertion. To help reduce cost for mass production, a card may only require the traces on one side (pins 1 to 85). The possibility of using only half the pin locations, combined with various height combinations, results in four different connector types that are available on the carrier card:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Connector Style!!Pins!!Mating Card Type
|-
!B
|85||One module that only needs pins 1-85
|-
!B+
|170||One module card that uses all available pins (1-170)
|-
!AB

|}

== AMCs used in MicroTCA systems ==
The AdvancedMC card is considered powerful enough that there are situations where the processing functionality is the only requirement. The MicroTCA standard is targeted at supplying a [[Commercial off-the-shelf|COTS]] [[chassis]] that will allow AMC cards to function without any AdvancedTCA carrier card. The function of the ATCA carrier board and of the ATCA shelf manager are concentrated on one board, which is called the MicroTCA Carrier Hub (MCH). On July 6, 2006 MicroTCA R1.0 was approved. Since this approval, companies like Advantech, [[Kontron]],  N.A.T., Annapolis Micro Systems, VadaTech Inc. , have launched AMC and MCH products.

Versions of MicroTCA with fewer AdvancedMC card slots are informally known as ''NanoTCA'' and ''PicoTCA''.

An '''air caster'''  is a [[pneumatic]] lifting device used to move heavy loads on flat, non-[[porous]] surfaces. Its operation is similar to a [[hovercraft]], as it uses a thin layer of air as a way to float a very small distance off the ground. Compressed air enters an [[airbag]] shaped like a [[torus]],&lt;ref name="caster"&gt;[http://www.hovair.com/air-bearing-info/air-bearing-answers/what-is-a-load-module.htm FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928172522/http://www.hovair.com/air-bearing-info/air-bearing-answers/what-is-a-load-module.htm |date=2007-09-28 }} from company that manufactures air casters, describing their operation.&lt;/ref&gt; and when the bag is filled it creates an [[airtight]] seal with the ground, and forces more air into the center of torus, eventually causing the air to flow over the bag and to raise the load above the ground.

The compressed air is forced under the airbag, pushing it and the load less than a millimeter off the ground.&lt;ref name="bearing"&gt;[http://www.hovair.com/air-bearing-info/air-bearing-answers/how-do-air-bearings-work.htm FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928172515/http://www.hovair.com/air-bearing-info/air-bearing-answers/how-do-air-bearings-work.htm |date=2007-09-28 }} from company that manufactures air bearings, a component of the air caster, describing their operation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Because air casters are virtually friction-free, the force required to move them is very low, often around one to five lbs. per 1,000&amp;nbsp;lbs. of weight. Air casters are also omni-directional, meaning they move with equal ease in any direction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airfloat.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Air casters require a smooth, non-porous surface in order to maintain lift and operate properly. Cracks and other surface defects can interrupt the proper flow of air, causing the air cushion to dissipate and thus lose its ability to lift. This limits their application to fields like [[manufacturing]], where such surfaces are abundant. Also necessary is connection to a system which provides [[compressed air]], as well as a power supply.

Usually, standard concrete [[warehouse]] or [[factory]] floors provide an adequate surface. Large cracks and expansion joints may need to be filled in. Overlay material can provide options for moving over rough surfaces. (Example: One can use an overlay material to move onto an area of broom finished concrete outside. The overlay material can be [[sheet metal]] or a heavy gauge [[plastic]] sheet material.)

== History ==
The air caster (originally called the air bearing) was invented by Harry A Mackie in December 1961 as the “pendant air bearing load supporting device” for General Motors Corporation&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Pendant air bearing load supporting device|url = http://www.google.nr/patents/US3167145|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative to the overhead crane, which ran opposed to a rail, creating friction free movement. In November 1963, Mackie, on behalf of General Motors Corporation, filed a patent for an “air bearing support with automatic air flow regulation”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Reversible air bearing support|url = http://www.google.nr/patents/US3246711|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first air caster designed to be used on the ground.

In January 1964, David R Snoeyenbos, while working for General Motors Corporation, revised the design of the air caster, and filed a patent for a “reversible air bearing support”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Reversible air bearing support|url = http://www.google.com/patents/US3246711|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Motors Corporation manufactured air casters, or “air bearings” for several years, then sold the rights to Snoeyenbos, who moved to Decatur, Illinois to found Airfloat. He launched his company from his brother’s manufacturing shop in 1964, and officially incorporated as the Airfloat Corp in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Us - Our Story {{!}} Airfloat|url = http://www.airfloat.com/about-us/|website = www.airfloat.com|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, air casters are manufactured by several companies worldwide, such as Aerofilm Systems, Airfloat, Air Caster Corp, AeroGo, Hovair, and Solving.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17967">'''Arthur Joseph Hungerford Pollen''' (13 September 1866 &amp;ndash; 28 January 1937) was a writer on naval affairs in the early 1900s who recognised the need for a computer-based [[fire-control system]].  The system took twelve years to develop but included the world's first electrically powered mechanical [[analogue computer]] (called at the time the [[Argo Clock]]).

Pollen was born on 13 September 1866, the sixth son and eighth child of eight sons and two daughters born to [[John Hungerford Pollen (senior)|John Hungerford Pollen]] and Maria Margaret Pollen.  His father being a leading convert to [[Catholicism]] along with [[Cardinal Newman]], Arthur was educated at the school which the latter founded in [[Birmingham]], [[The Oratory School]] (1878&amp;ndash;1884).  He then went up to read [[Modern History]] at [[Trinity College, Oxford]] where he gained a second-class degree in 1888.  In 1893 he was called to the bar at [[Lincoln's Inn]].  He then took an interest in parliamentary politics, standing as [[Liberal Party (UK)|Radical]] candidate for the [[Walthamstow (UK Parliament constituency)|Walthamstow Division]] of [[Essex]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1895|General Election of 1895]] which he lost; his 4,523 votes to the 6,876 of his opponent, [[Edmund Widdrington Byrne]], MP, [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].  After this setback he continued to speak at Liberal Party events, but declined to stand in the [[by-election]] brought about by Byrne's resignation in 1897.

On 7 September 1898 he married Maud Beatrice, the only daughter of the leading [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Joseph Lawrence (British politician)|Joseph Lawrence]], (later Sir Joseph Lawrence, Bart.) who was also chairman of Linotype &amp; Machinery Co. Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;Confirmed by F.C Burnand. ''The Catholics Who's Who &amp; Year Book 1908'' pp. 326-328. Available online via Google Books. For Linotype &amp; Machinery Co. Ltd., see {{cite web|last= |first= |url=http://www.mosi.org.uk/media/33870636/thelinotypeandmachineryco.pdf |format=pdf |title=The Linotype &amp; Machinery Co. Ltd |work= |accessdate=2010-07-22 |publisher=[[Museum of Science and Industry (Manchester)]] |year=2001 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207091253/http://www.mosi.org.uk/media/33870636/thelinotypeandmachineryco.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-07 |df= }}. See also [[Linotype machine]].&lt;/ref&gt;  With Maud he had one daughter, who died aged four, and two sons.&lt;ref&gt;The elder son was Arthur Joseph Lawrence Pollen (1899–1968) who married 1926 Hon. Daphne Baring, a daughter of [[Baron Revelstoke|Cecil Baring, 3rd Baron Revelstoke]] and had issue. Their granddaughter is [[Clare Asquith]] nee Mary Clare Pollen.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1898 Pollen was made the managing-director of Linotype, which he ran successfully for the next decade.

==Fire control==
Through a relative, Commander [[William Goodenough]], Pollen saw a naval gunnery practice near [[Malta]] in 1900, and the accuracy was so poor that even at ranges of less than a mile the big guns could not reliably hit their targets.&lt;ref&gt;Pollen 'Gunnery' p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  On the board of the Linotype Company at the time was [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], widely regarded as Britain's leading scientist.  It was Kelvin who proposed using an analogue computer to solve the equations which arise from the relative motion of the ships engaged in the battle and the time delay in the flight of the shell to calculate the required trajectory and therefore the direction and elevation of the guns.  Kelvin's brother [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]] was responsible for producing a tidal analyser using a ball, disc and cylinder [[differential analyzer]] which was the original source of the suggested analogue computer.&lt;ref&gt;Pollen 'Gunnery' p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

However first accurate data is needed of the target's position and relative motion.  Pollen developed a plotting unit (or plotter) to capture this data.  He added a gyroscope to allow for the [[Yaw angle|yaw]] of the firing ship.  Again this required substantial development of the, at the time, primitive gyroscope to provide continuous reliable correction.&lt;ref&gt;Pollen 'Gunnery' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Pollen utilised the resources of Linotype for his work, specifically the services of a designer named Harold Isherwood.  Trials were carried out in 1905 and 1906, which although completely unsuccessful showed promise.  To further the development of fire-control Pollen set up in 1909 the Argo Company, and in 1911 took a holding in the firm of Thomas Cooke &amp; Sons of [[York]], who had been manufacturing components for his equipment.

Early on Pollen was encouraged in his efforts by the rapidly rising figure of Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]], Admiral [[Arthur Knyvet Wilson]] and the Director of Naval Ordnance and Torpedoes (DNO), [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|John Jellicoe]].  Many officers in the navy were naturally interested in the prospect of being able to have ranges calculated for them so that they could achieve a greater rate of hits against the enemy.  In early 1906, while presenting his planned "Aim Correction" system to naval officers, he met for the second time a promising gunnery lieutenant, [[Frederic Dreyer]].  The nature of Pollen's work involved close cooperation with the Navy, and upon Dreyer's appointment as Assistant to the DNO with responsibility for fire-control he was invited to view Pollen's Linotype works at [[Broadheath, Greater Manchester|Broadheath]], near [[Altrincham]]. Pollen had had a long relationship with Dreyer's predecessor, Lieutenant Harding.

Pollen continued his work, with tests carried out on Royal Navy warships intermittently.  Equipment was repeatedly purchased, despite the misgivings of successive DNOs [[Reginald Bacon]] and [[Gordon Moore (Royal Navy officer)|Gordon Moore]].

Dreyer began producing his own fire-control computer. The fundamental difference between the systems was that the Dreyer system was a "dual rate" approach that plotted ranges and bearings separately, versus time rather than using a single rangefinder to take both ranges and bearings to drive the drawing of a plan view of own and target ships, as in the Argo system.&lt;ref&gt;Pollen Aim Correction System. Part I. Technical History and Technical Comparison with Commander F.C. Dreyer's Fire Control System&lt;/ref&gt;  The systems differed in other particulars.

The single prototype Dreyer Fire Control Table (called simply "the Original") did not include a gyroscope,&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Captain F. C. Dreyer's Fire Control Tables, Plate 45.  No flexible shafting atop the dumaresq.&lt;/ref&gt; though the first adopted for service in 1912&amp;mdash;the Mark III&amp;mdash;did.&lt;ref&gt;Pollen Aim Correction System. Part I. Technical History and Technical Comparison with Commander F.C. Dreyer's Fire Control System, Chapter V, Figure 3.  Note flexible shaft bringing gyrocompass repeater indications atop the dumaresq.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, the automatic plotting of rangefinder readings on the Original Dreyer table&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Captain F. C. Dreyer's Fire Control Tables, Plate 45&lt;/ref&gt; and early service examples&lt;ref&gt;Pollen Aim Correction System. Part I. Technical History and Technical Comparison with Commander F.C. Dreyer's Fire Control System, Chapter V, Figure 3&lt;/ref&gt; was later discarded in favour of manual plotting keyboards which were capable of plotting the data of multiple rangefinders.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Captain F. C. Dreyer's Fire Control Tables, Plate 45&lt;/ref&gt;  Dreyer played a key role within the Admiralty in deciding which system to use, and always chose his own.

Certain aspects of the Dreyer Table Mk III were found by a subsequent [[Royal Commission]] to be similar to Pollen's work and £30,000 compensation was paid to Pollen in 1926 based on a theoretical number of his Argo units which might have been fitted in Royal Navy ships, most of which were never constructed.  Pollen's supporters have argued that the poor performance of Naval gunnery at the [[Battle of Jutland]]&lt;ref&gt;Pollen 'Gunnery' p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]&lt;ref&gt;Pollen 'Gunnery' p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; was due to the shortcomings of the Dreyer system, but others cite the tactics of the commander of the British battlecruisers, [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Vice-Admiral David Beatty]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollen 'Gunnery' pp. 231–249&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalism==
At the outbreak of [[World War I]] Pollen's relationship with the admiralty had broken down to the extent that he had been removed from the list of recognised Naval contractors. The war also interrupted negotiations which had begun with foreign navies aimed at selling the argo system to them. Some units had been purchased by Russia before the outbreak of war and some more were sold, but no other countries purchased units.  Pollen was thus under-employed. He wrote to  a friend, Alfred Spender, editor of the [[Westminster Gazette]], asking whether he would be interested in articles about the naval war. Spender agreed. In  April 1915 he accepted a post as a feature writer for [[Land and Water]], making this a full-time employment rather just supplying one weekly article. His task was made easier by ongoing good relations with various naval officers he had met as part of his work on the Argo AC system. He remained in contact with [[James Masterton-Smith]], [[Private secretary]] to the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], and with [[William Reginald Hall]], who had been impressed by tests conducted on his ship, [[HMS Natal]], and was appointed Director of Naval Intelligence shortly after the start of the war. Hall commented on the usefulness to him of a responsive journalist, should he need to present a story to the public. Pollen also embarked on a career as a lecturer, speaking at public meetings about naval affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Pollen 'Gunnery' pp. 146–149&lt;/ref&gt;

After news of the [[Battle of Jutland]] began to break in Britain, based upon German reports of victory, Pollen attempted to redress the shortcomings of official reports issued by the admiralty, which as a terse statement of facts known to them, invited the worst possible interpretation of events. Writing for the 'Westminster Gazette' he attempted to stress the overarching result of the engagement, that the German fleet had fled in the presence of the British, and to spread this view amongst other journalists. This response to the news was in contrast to many other leading newspapers, which only belatedly began to regard the battle as a victory.&lt;ref&gt;Pollen 'Gunnery' pp. 151–155&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollen was generally supportive of the establishment and admiralty.  However, on occasions he disagreed publicly with their handling of the war. Commentators, such as [[Winston Churchill]] had written articles observing that British supremacy at sea was secured by the dominance of the British fleet over the German, even though no battle had been fought. This was in accord with theories of sea power, such as advocated by [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]. Pollen argued that the cost in this case of the unresolved conflict was that Germany retained significant control of the [[Baltic Sea]], and tied up the larger part of the British fleet patrolling the North Sea. The fleet might otherwise have been used combatting submarine attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Pollen 'Gunnery' pp. 159–162&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1917 Pollen wrote an article in ''Land and water'' critical of the way the war against submarine attacks was being conducted, and against failures in administrative organisation of the admiralty. This was followed by another article of 3 May arguing Britain had lost control of the seas in the face of mounting losses of merchant shipping to submarines, which drew the attention of the official censor and could not be published. Reaction to the censorship of a respected columnist inevitably led to greater publicity of the issue than if the article had been published, and its contents became known. The admiralty had resisted introducing a convoy system for merchant ships for some time, believing it was impractical and that too few naval vessels were available as escorts. By the end of April the admiralty had agreed to start forming ships into convoys, although it remains a source of debate to what extent this was a result of public pressure, the direct intervention of the prime minister, [[David Lloyd George]] or the natural result of convoy trials already being conducted. Although there was great concern at mounting shipping losses and shortages of materials and food, it also remains unclear to what extent the situation was sufficiently critical to have affected Britain's ability to conduct the war.&lt;ref&gt;Pollen 'Gunnery' pp. 203–212&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1917 Pollen embarked on a visit to America to discuss possible sales of Argo systems. He was approached by [[John Buchan]], Director of Propaganda in the British Foreign Office,  asking that he could publicise the work of the navy while there and encourage the development of the American navy. Pollen sought to address a perception amongst Americans that the British fleet had failed to defeat the German fleet, or resolve the submarine issue, thus leaving American ships open to attack. It was felt that his position as a critic of British policy added to his credibility when defending it. The success of his visit led to an offer by the British government of a knighthood and salary, should he return to America and continue a propaganda campaign. Pollen declined, arguing that he would be received entirely differently if acting in an official capacity than as an independent commentator.&lt;ref&gt;Pollen 'Gunnery' pp. 215– 224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jutland and Jellicoe===
Pollen became extremely critical of the actions of the British [[Grand Fleet]], in particular as commanded by Jellicoe. [[Ethel Beatty]], wife of Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Beatty]], made a point of becoming friendly with Pollen in May 1917. Pollen declared to her that he intended to have Jellicoe removed from his post as [[First Sea Lord]] within a month, and proceeded with a campaign seeking to impress his views upon anyone he could get to listen.&lt;ref&gt;Massie 'Castles'  pp. 741–742 citing Beatty Papers II pp. 422, 429&lt;/ref&gt; Pollen later wrote a book about the [[Battle of Jutland]] which argued that any positive actions credited to Jellicoe must have been the work of Admiral Beatty ("The Navy in Battle", 1918).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Arthur Pollen |title=The Navy in Battle |place=London |publisher=Chatto and Windus |year= 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was described by the author of the official report on Jutland as a work which "teems with inaccuracies",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rear Admiral Harper |title= The Truth About Jutland |page=146 |year=1927 |publisher= John Murray |place= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Jellicoe's biographers as "full of errors",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= A.T. Patterson |title= Jellicoe papers II |page=412}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "almost unreadable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Winton |title=Jellicoe | publisher=Michael Joseph |place=London |year= 1981 |page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massie 'Castles' p. 677&lt;/ref&gt; Jellicoe wrote to a friend in 1921: "It fell to me to turn down his inventions on more than one occasion".&lt;ref&gt;Jellicoe 'Jellicoe Papers' II p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-War==
After World War I the Argo company had effectively ceased trading, and interest in naval journalism declined. Pollen had continued as a part-time director of Linotype and now joined the board of [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|The Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited]] (BSA). He became an active member of the Council of the [[Federation of British Industries]] and became its vice-president. He became chairman of the [[British Commonwealth Union]] and espoused the role of the entrepreneur in growth of industry, campaigning against the growth of socialism. In 1926 the post of managing director of Linotype became vacant, and he returned to it, hiring one of the first management consultants, [[T. Gerald Rose]], to help reorganise the company. He was invited to become chairman of BSA, but declined, not having sufficient time to manage two companies. In 1936 he was part of a group of Catholics who acquired the Catholic magazine, [[The Tablet]], and served as its chairman for a year while its fortunes were restored.&lt;ref&gt;Pollen 'Gunnery' pp. 245–249&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Discrene Breast forms.JPG|thumb|A pair of breast prostheses with glued on nipples]]
'''Breast prostheses''' are breast forms intended to simulate [[breast]]s. There are a number of materials and designs; although, the most common construction is [[silicone]] gel in a plastic skin. Off-the shelf breast prostheses come in a range of shapes and sizes, while customised breast prostheses are moulded to fit an individual's chest by taking an impression of both breasts and sculpting a mirror image. Pals Breast Forms consist of a non silicone gel which can be trimmed to fit with scissors, then sent back for customization. Fabrication of customised prostheses is typically done by an [[anaplastology|anaplastologist]] who makes [[somato prosthesis|somato prostheses]]. The [[areola]] and [[nipple]] may be replicated by being moulded into the breast form or a separate [[nipple prosthesis]] may be attached to the breast prosthesis. Both custom made and off-the shelf breast prostheses come in varieties that are designed to either be held in a pocket in a specially designed mastectomy bra or attached to the skin and worn with a standard bra.

Breast prostheses have a long history.  In the 19th century they were made of rubber.  On 22 September 1885, one Charles L. Morehouse received US patent 326915&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=00326915&amp;SectionNum=1&amp;IDKey=387BC5C50731|title=Patent Images|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his "Breast-Pad", made of natural rubber and filled with air at normal pressure.

== Mastectomy ==
Breast prostheses are most commonly used after a [[mastectomy]], usually a consequence of [[Breast cancer|cancer]]. They may act as an alternative to, or a stopgap measure until, [[plastic surgery]] to reconstruct a breast.&lt;ref&gt;http://canceraustralia.gov.au/affected-cancer/cancer-types/breast-cancer/living-breast-cancer/managing-physical-changes-due-breast-cancer/breast-cancer-and-body-image/breast-prostheses Use of Prostheses&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/node/1154066 Breast Prostheses&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transgender ==
Many pre or non-hormonal [[trans woman|transwomen]] and males who [[cross-dressing|cross-dress]] as females use breast prostheses in order to create the illusion of feminine breasts. They are sometimes combined with [[cleavage enhancement]] techniques when used with clothing with low necklines.

[[Image:BBCleavageTopView.JPG|thumb|Example of a man wearing a cleavage top]]
Full frontal [[Cleavage Tops]] are also available, mainly marketed to the Transgender community. They incorporate a pair of breast prostheses in a one-piece skin coloured garment that is designed to provide the illusion of natural cleavage. Such garments have the disadvantage of having a visible top edge at the neck, which requires the wearing of a [[choker]] or similar necklace to hide the top edge of the garment. The edges of the breast prostheses are often distinguishable through the thin outer cover.

== Shapes ==
Non-customised prostheses are made of different shapes to suit the extent of breast tissue removal or the shape of a crossdresser's chest. [[Asymmetry|Asymmetric]] breast forms incorporate an extension towards the armpit to replicate the shape of the [[tail of Spence]], while [[Reflection symmetry|symmetric]] "triangle" or "teardrop" prostheses do not incorporate that extension. Customised prostheses will mirror the other breast.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29434">'''Brine mining''' is the extraction of useful materials ([[Chemical element|elements]] or [[Chemical compound|compounds]]) which are naturally [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolved]] in [[brine]]. The brine may be [[seawater]], other surface water, or groundwater. It differs from solution mining or [[in-situ leach|in-situ leaching]] in that those methods inject water or chemicals to dissolve materials which are in a solid state; in brine mining, the materials are already dissolved.

Brines are important sources of salt, iodine, lithium, magnesium, potassium, bromine, and other materials, and potentially important sources of a number of others.

==History==
Around 500 BCE, the ancient Chinese dug hundreds of brine wells, some of which were over 100 meters (330 feet) in depth. Large brine deposits under the earth's surface were drilled by drilling boreholes.&lt;ref name="tom 1989 103"&gt;Tom (1989), 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Bamboo towers were erected, similar in style to modern-day oil derricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the Ancient World |last=Krebs |first=Robert E.  |last2= Krebs  |first2= Carolyn A. |publisher=Greenwood |year=2003 |isbn= 978-0313313424 |publication-date=December 30, 2003 |page=255-256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamboo was used for ropes, casing, and derricks since it was salt resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Evaporites: A Geological Compendium  |last=Warren  |first=John K. |publisher=Springer |year=2016 |publication-date=May 18, 2016 |page=1034}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iron wedges were hung from a bamboo  cable tool attached to a lever on a platform constructed atop the tower. The derricks required two to three men jumping on and off the lever that moved the iron wedge pounded into the ground to dig a hole deep enough into the ground to hit the brine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Evaporites: A Geological Compendium  |last=Warren  |first=John K. |publisher=Springer |year=2016 |publication-date=May 18, 2016 |page=1034}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the Ancient World |last=Krebs |first=Robert E.  |last2= Krebs  |first2= Carolyn A. |publisher=Greenwood |year=2003 |isbn= 978-0313313424 |publication-date=December 30, 2003 |page=255-256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of brines used for mineral extraction==
Commercial brines include both surface water (seawater and saline lakes) and groundwater (shallow brine beneath saline or dry lakes, and deep brines in sedimentary basins). Brine brought to the surface by geothermal energy wells often contains high concentrations of minerals, but is not currently used for commercial mineral extraction.

===Seawater===
[[Seawater]] has been used as a source of [[sea salt]] since prehistoric times, and more recently of magnesium and bromine. Potassium is sometimes recovered from the [[bittern (salt)|bittern]] left after salt precipitation. The oceans are often described as an inexhaustible resource.

===Saline lakes===
There are many [[saline lake]]s with salinity greater than seawater, making them attractive for mineral extraction. Examples are the Dead Sea and the Great Salt Lake. In addition, some saline lakes, such as [[Lake Natron]] in East Africa, have chemistry very different than seawater, making them potential sources of sodium carbonate.

===Shallow groundwater brines associated with saline or dry lakes===
The groundwater beneath saline or [[dry lake]]s often has brines with chemistry similar to that of the lakes or former lakes.

The chemistry of shallow brines used for mineral extraction is sometimes influenced by geothermal waters. This is true of a number of shallow brines in the western United States, such as at Searles Lake, California.

===Geothermal brines===  
Geothermal power plants often bring brine to the surface as part of the operation. This brine is usually re-injected into the ground, but some experiments have been made to extract  minerals before re-injection. Brine brought to the surface by geothermal energy plants has been used in pilot plants as a source of colloidal silica (Wairkei, New Zealand, and Mammoth Lakes, California), and as a source of zinc ([[Salton Sea]], California).&lt;ref&gt; W. L. Bourcier, M. Lin, and G. Nix, [https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/324646.pdf Recovery of Minerals and Metals from Geothermal Fluids], Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 8 Sept. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Boron was recovered circa 1900 from geothermal steam at Larderello, Italy. Lithium recovery has also been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gordon Bloomquist, "Economic benefits of mineral extraction from geothermal brines," 2006, Washington State University Extension Energy Program.&lt;/ref&gt; But as of 2015, there is no sustained commercial-scale mineral recovery from geothermal brine.

===Deep brines in sedimentary basins===
The concentration of dissolved solids in deep [[connate water]] varies from much less than sea water to ten times the total dissolved solids of sea water. In general, total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations increase with depth. Most deep groundwaters classified as brines (having total dissolved solids equal to or greater than that of seawater) are predominantly sodium chloride type. However, the predominance of chloride usually increases with increasing TDS, at the expense of sulfate. The ratio of calcium to sodium usually increases with depth.&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. White, "Saline waters in sedimentary rocks", in Addison Young and John E. Galley (eds.), ''Fluids in Subsurface Environments'', American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Memoir 4, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of groundwater with TDS higher than seawater is in some cases due to contact with salt beds. More often, however, the higher TDS of deep sediments is thought to be the result of the sediments acting as semi-permeable membranes. As the sediments compact under burial pressure, the dissolved species are less mobile than the water, resulting in higher TDS concentrations than seawater. Bivalent species such as calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;) are less mobile than univalent species such as sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), resulting in calcium enrichment. The ratio of potassium to sodium (K/Na) may increase or decrease with depth, thought to be the result of ion exchange with the sediments.&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. White, "Saline waters in sedimentary rocks", in Addison Young and John E. Galley (eds.), ''Fluids in Subsurface Environments'', American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Memoir 4, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials recovered from brines==
Many brines contain more than one recovered product. For instance, the shallow brine beneath [[Searles Lake]], [[California]], is or has been a source of [[borax]], [[potash]], [[bromine]], [[lithium]], [[phosphate]], [[soda ash]], and [[sodium sulfate]].

{{main|Sea salt}}

Salt ([[sodium chloride]]) has been a valuable commodity since prehistoric times, and its extraction from sea water also goes back to prehistory. Salt is extracted from seawater in many countries around the world, but the majority of salt put on the market today is mined from solid [[evaporite]] deposits.

Salt is produced as a byproduct of potash extraction from [[Dead Sea]] brine at one plant in [[Israel]] ([[Dead Sea Works]]), and another in [[Jordan]] (Arab Salt Works). The total salt precipitated in solar evaporation at the Dead Sea plants is tens of millions of tons annually, but very little of the salt is marketed. 

Today, salt from groundwater brines is generally a byproduct of the process of extracting other dissolved substances from brines and constitutes only a small part of world salt production. In the United States, salt is recovered from surface brine at the [[Great Salt Lake]], Utah, and from a shallow subsurface brine at [[Searles Lake]], California.

===Sodium sulfate===
In 1997 about two-thirds of world [[sodium sulfate]] production was recovered from brine. Two plants in the US, at Searles Lake, California, and [[Seagraves, Texas]], recovered sodium sulfate from shallow brines beneath dry lakes.

===Soda ash===
Soda ash ([[sodium carbonate]]) is recovered from shallow subsurface brines at Searles Lake, California. Soda ash was formerly extracted at [[El Caracol, Ecatepec]], in [[Mexico City]], from the remnant of [[Lake Texcoco]].

===Colloidal silica===
Brines brought to the surface by geothermal energy production often contain concentrations of dissolved silica of about 500 parts per million. A number of geothermal plants have pilot-tested recovery of [[colloidal silica]], including those at Wairakei, New Zealand, Mammoth Lakes, California, and the Salton Sea, California. To date, colloidal silica from brine has not achieved commercial production.&lt;ref&gt;W. L. Bourcier, M. Lin, and G.

Most Recently Anson Resources have discovered Lithium in the paradox basin in Utah reading 142ppm.

In 2015 subsurface brines yielded about half of the world's [[lithium]] production. Whereas seawater contains about 0.17 mg/l, subsurface brines may contain up to 4,000 mg/l, more than four [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] greater than sea water. Typical commercial lithium concentrations are between 200 and 1,400&amp;nbsp;mg/l.

The largest operations are in the shallow brine beneath the [[Salar de Atacama]] dry lakebed in [[Chile]], which as of 2015 yielded about a third of the world's supply. The brine operations are primarily for potassium; extraction of lithium as a byproduct began in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;US Geological Survey, [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/mcs-2016-lithi.pdf Lithium], Mineral Commodity Summary, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shallow brine beneath the [[Salar de Uyuni]] in Bolivia is thought to contain the world's largest lithium resource, often estimated to be half or more of the world's resource. As of 2015, no commercial extraction has taken place, other than a pilot plant.

Commercial deposits of shallow lithium brines beneath dry lakebeds have the following characteristics in common:&lt;ref&gt;Dwight Bradley and others, "A preliminary deposit model for lithium brines," US Geological Survey, Open-File Report 2013{{nsndns}}1006, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Arid climate
* Closed basin with a dry or seasonal lake
* Tectonically-driven subsidence
* Igneous or geothermal activity
* Lithium-rich source rock
* Permeable aquifers
* Enough time to concentrate brine

In 2010 Simbol Materials received a $3 million grant from the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] for a pilot project aimed at showing the financial feasibility of extracting high-quality lithium from [[geothermal]] brine. It uses brine from the 49.9&amp;nbsp;megawatt Featherstone geothermal power plant in California's [[Imperial Valley]]. Simbol passes the plant's extracted fluid through a series of membranes, filters and adsorption materials to extract lithium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.civilbeat.com/2015/04/could-hawaii-geothermal-plant-become-a-windfall-for-public|title = Could Hawaii Geothermal Plant Become a Windfall for Public?|last = Kaneya|first = Rui|date = April 13, 2015|work = Civil Beat|access-date = April 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, MGX Minerals developed a proprietary design process (U.S. Provisional Patent #62/419,011) to potentially recover lithium and other valuable minerals from highly mineralized oilfield brine. The company has acquired development rights to over approximately 1.7 million acres of brine-bearing formations in Canada and Utah. According to MGX, the [[Saskatchewan Research Council]], an independent laboratory, verified the MGX Minerals  petrolithium extraction technology in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt; Rockstone Research (https://www.rockstone-research.com/images/PDF/MGX20en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boron]] is recovered from shallow brines beneath Searles Lake, California, by Searles Valley Minerals. Although boron is the primary product, [[potassium]] and other salts are also recovered as byproducts.

The brine beneath the Salar de Olaroz, Argentina, is a commercial source of boron, lithium, and potassium.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.orocobre.com/operations/salar-de-olaroz/ Projects Olaroz], Orocobre website, accessed 17 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brines are a major source of [[iodine]] supply worldwide. Major deposits occur in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]]. Iodine is recovered from deep brines pumped to the surface as a byproduct of oil and natural gas production. Seawater contains about 0.06&amp;nbsp;mg/l iodine, while subsurface brines contain as much as 1,560&amp;nbsp;mg/l, more than five orders of magnitude greater than seawater. The source of the iodine is thought to be organic material in [[shale]]s, which also form the source rock for the associated hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;Jean E. Moran, "Origin of iodine in the Anadarko Basin, Oklahoma: an 129I study" AAPG Bulletin, May 1996, v.80 n.5 p.685{{nsndns}}694.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
By far the largest source of iodine from brine is Japan, where iodine-rich water is co-produced with natural gas. Iodine extraction began in 1934. In 2013 seven companies were reported to be extracting iodine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/iodine/myb1-2013-iodin.pdf Iodine], US Geological Survey, Minerals Yearbook 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese iodine brines are produced from mostly marine sediments ranging in age from [[Pliocene]] to [[Pleistocene]]. The main producing area is the Southern Kanto gas field on the east-central coast of [[Honshu]]. The iodine content of the brine can be as high as 160{{nbsp}}ppm.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.segemar.gov.ar/bibliotecaintemin/LIBROSDIGITALES/Industrialminerals&amp;rocks7ed/pdffiles/papers/042.pdf Iodine]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anadarko Basin, Oklahoma====
Since 1977, iodine has been extracted from brine in the Morrow Sandstone of [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian age]], at locations in the [[Anadarko Basin]]. of northwest Oklahoma. The brine occurs at depths of 6,000 to 10,000 feet, and contains about 300{{nbsp}}ppm iodine.&lt;ref&gt;S.{{nbsp}}T. Krukowski, "Iodine," ''Mining Engineering'', June 2011, p.74.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the world's [[bromine]] production is derived from brine. The majority is recovered from Dead Sea brine at plants in Israel and Jordan, where bromine is a byproduct of potash recovery. Plants in the United States (''see: [[Bromine production in the United States]]''), China, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine, recover bromine from subsurface brines. In India and Japan, bromine is recovered as a byproduct of sea salt production.

The first commercial production of magnesium from seawater was recorded in 1923, when some solar salt plants around San Francisco Bay, California, extracted magnesium from the bitterns left after salt precipitation. 

The [[Dow Chemical Company]] began producing magnesium on a small scale in 1916, from deep subsurface brine in the [[Michigan Basin]]. In 1933, Dow began using an ion exchange process to concentrate the magnesium in its brine. In 1941, prompted by the need for magnesium for aircraft during World War II, Dow started a large plant at [[Freeport, Texas]], to extract magnesium from the sea. A number of other plants to extract magnesium from brine were built in the US, including one near the Freeport plant at [[Velasco, Texas|Velasco]]. At the end of World War II, all shut down except the plant at Freeport, Texas, although the Velasco plant was reactivated during the Korean War.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Gross, "magnesium from the sea," in: Frank E. Firth (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of Marine Resources'' (New York: Von Nostrand, 1969) 368-372.&lt;/ref&gt;The magnesium plant at Freeport operated until 1998, when Dow announced that it would not rebuild the unit following hurricane damage.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Lieberman, [http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/marvin.lieberman/publications/MagnesiumIndustryTransition2001.PDF Magnesium, industry in transition], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because metallic magnesium is extracted from brine by an electrolytic process, the economics are sensitive to the cost of electricity. Dow had located their facility on the Texas coast to take advantage of cheap natural gas for electrical generation. In 1951, Norsk Hydro started a magnesium-from-seawater plant at Heroya, Norway, supplied by inexpensive hydroelectricity. The two seawater magnesium plants, in Texas and Norway, provided more than half the world's primary magnesium through the 1950s and 1960s. 

As of 2014, the only producer of primary magnesium metal in the United States was U.S. Magnesium LLC, which extracted the metal from surface brine of the Great Salt Lake, at its plant in [[Rowley, Utah]].

The Dead Sea Works in Israel produces [[magnesium]] as a byproduct of potash extraction.

Starting in 2002, CalEnergy extracted zinc from brines at its geothermal energy plants at the Salton Sea, California. At full production, the company hoped to produce 30,000 metric tons of 99.99% pure zinc per year, yielding about as much profit as the company made from geothermal energy. But the zinc recovery unit did not perform as anticipated, and zinc recovery halted in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;W. L. Bourcier, M. Lin, and G.

Some near-surface brines in the western United States contain anomalously high concentrations of dissolved [[tungsten]]. Should recovery ever prove economic, some brines could be significant sources of tungsten. For instance, brines beneath Searles Lake, California, with concentrations of about 56&amp;nbsp;mg/l tungsten (70&amp;nbsp;mg/l WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), contain about 8.5 million short tons of tungsten. Although 90% of the dissolved tungsten is technically recoverable by [[ion exchange resin]]s, recovery is uneconomic.&lt;ref&gt;S. Warren Hobbs and James E. Elliottt, "Tungsten," in Donald A.

In 2012 research for the US Department of Energy, building on Japanese research from the 1990s, tested a method for [[Uranium_mining#Recovery_from_seawater|extracting uranium from seawater]], which, they concluded, could extract uranium at a cost of US$660/kg. While this was still five times the cost of uranium from ore, the amount of uranium dissolved in seawater would be enough to provide nuclear fuel for thousands of years at current rates of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22201-record-haul-of-uranium-harvested-from-seawater/ “Record haul of uranium harvested from seawater,”] ''New Scientist'', 22 Aug. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to extract [[gold]] from seawater were common in the early 20th century. A number of people claimed to be able to economically recover gold from [[sea water]], but they were all either mistaken or acted in an intentional deception. Prescott Jernegan ran a gold-from-seawater swindle in the [[United States]] in the 1890s. A British fraudster ran the same scam in [[England]] in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Plazak, Dan ''A Hole in the Ground with a Liar at the Top'' (Salt Lake: Univ. of Utah Press, 2006) {{ISBN|0-87480-840-5}} (contains a chapter on gold-from seawater swindles)&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Fritz Haber]] (the German inventor of the [[Haber process]]) did research on the extraction of gold from sea water in an effort to help pay [[Germany]]'s reparations following [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Das Gold im Meerwasser|first=F.|last= Haber|volume=40|issue=11|date=1927|doi=10.1002/ange.19270401103|pages=303–314|journal=Zeitschrift für Angewandte Chemie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on published values of 2 to 64{{nbsp}}ppb of gold in seawater, a commercially successful extraction seemed possible. After analysis of 4,000 water samples yielding an average of 0.004{{nbsp}}ppb, it became clear to Haber that the extraction would not be possible, and he stopped the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/0375-6742(88)90051-9|title = Concentration of gold in natural waters|first= J.B.|last = McHugh|journal = Journal of Geochemical Exploration|volume = 30|date = 1988|pages = 85–94|issue = 1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The institute was established in 1952 and was known as the West African Building Research Institute in [[Accra]].&lt;ref name=BRRI/&gt; It was made up of building engineers from Ghana and [[Nigeria]]. The institute had a name change in 1960 when the institute's members from Nigeria left to form the [[Nigerian Building and Road Research Institute]].&lt;ref name=NBRRI&gt;{{cite web|title=NBRRI, Ghana's BRRI Sign MoU On Local Building Materials|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200905041367.html|publisher=www.allafrica.com|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was because Nigeria had gained independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It became known as the Building Research Institute of the [[Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. The institute relocated to the campus of the [[Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology]] in [[Kumasi]] in 1963. This was to allow the institute's members to lecture at the university due to university under-staffing.&lt;ref name=BRRI/&gt;

==Professional bodies of the institute==
The institute is made up of various professional groupings. They include architects, engineers, planners, quantity surveyors.&lt;ref name=BRRI/&gt;

==Mandate and name change==
In 1964 the government of Ghana expanded the functions of the institution to include road research. The name of the institution was changed to include the new function to the Building and Road Research Institute.&lt;ref name=BRRI/&gt;

==Relocation==
In 1995, the institute moved from the KNUST campus to it present site at [[Fumesua]] in [[Kumasi]].&lt;ref name=BRRI/&gt;&lt;ref name=POZO&gt;{{cite web|title=Pozzolana cement, a breakthrough|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/features/artikel.php?ID=124475|publisher=www.ghanaweb.com|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new site which is about 20 kilometres from the institute's former location is called the Kumasi Science City. It houses research institutions in Kumasi. The other institutions include the [[Forestry Research Institute of Ghana]] (FORIG) and the [[Crops Research Institute]] (CRI).&lt;ref name=BRRI/&gt;

==Aim of the institute==
The institute was established as a research and development organisation in the construction industry with the purposes of offering research and development products and services to the building and road sectors for the development of Ghana.&lt;ref name=BRRI/&gt;

==Vision==
A centre of excellence that offers a one stop service in the conduct of research, training and technology transfer in the construction and transportation sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brri.org/index.php/about-us|title=Vision|publisher=BRRI|date=|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement==
To promote the conduct of demand-driven and problem based research, provide training and technology transfer that links effectively to the socio-economic development of the country particularly the building, road and transport industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brri.org/index.php/about-us|title=Mission Statement of the Institute|publisher=BRRI|date=|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==

*To undertake Research and Development of local building materials for shelter construction.
*To tailor research and development activities to national needs.
*To generate 30% of the institute's budgetary needs.
*To undertake public good research.
*To embark on profitable contract research with industries.
*To improve safety on roads in Ghana.
*To undertake research into all aspects of building and road design and construction with the view to ensuring efficiency, safety and economy.
*To develop construction materials from local source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brri.org/index.php/about-us|title=Objectives|publisher=BRRI|date=|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Researches==
The institute works on developing alternative building materials that last longer and cost cheaper for the Ghanaian building industry.

===Pozzolana Cement===
The institute in the 1990s begun researching into [[Pozzolana]] cement, an alternative [[cement]] to the [[Portland cement]] for building.&lt;ref name=POZO/&gt; Pozzolana cement cost less than Portland cement. In May, 2007, BRRI and PMC Global Incorporated of [[United States|America]] signed a contract for the commercial production of Pozzolana.&lt;ref name=POZO/&gt; The agreement included PMC offering 150,000 [[United States dollars|dollars]] to BRRI for expansion of the pilot plant for the production of the pozzolana at the institute and land acquisition for the building of a plant by PMC for the production process.&lt;ref name=POZO/&gt;

==Collaborations==
BRRI has research collaboration with other state and foreign agencies. In 2007, BRRI and the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL) of the [[United Kingdom]] worked together on a program of national studies in Ghana for two years. The purpose of the collaboration was to research into developing building materials that would benefit both bodies.&lt;ref name=trrl&gt;{{cite web|title=BRRI/TRRL Research Cooperation in Ghana|url=http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=841962|publisher=www.trid.trb.org|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the institutes and its Nigerian counterpart (NBRRI) signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] to research into building and road construction materials.&lt;ref name=NBRRI/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2623">'''Computer Interface to Message Distribution''' ('''CIMD''') is a proprietary [[short message service centre]] [[Communications protocol|protocol]] developed by [[Nokia]] for their [[Short message service center|SMSC]] (now: [[Nokia Networks]]).

==Syntax==

An example CIMD exchange looks like the following:

  &lt;STX&gt;03:007&lt;TAB&gt;021:12345678&lt;TAB&gt;033:hello&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;   
  &lt;STX&gt;53:007&lt;TAB&gt;021:12345678&lt;TAB&gt;060:971107131212&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;

Each packet starts with STX (hex 02) and ends with ETX (hex 03).  The content of the packet consists of fields separated by TAB (hex 09).  Each field, in turn, consists of a ''parameter type'', a colon (:), and the ''parameter value''.  Note that the last field must also be terminated with a TAB before the ETX.

Two-digit parameter types are ''operation codes'' and each message must have exactly one.  The number after the operation code is the ''sequence number'' used to match an operation to its response.  The response code ([[Acknowledgement (data networks)|acknowledgement]]) of the message is equal to the operation code plus 50.

In the example above, the operation code 03 means submit message.  Field 021 defines the destination address ([[telephone number]]), with field 033 is the user data (content) of the message.  Response code 53 with a field 060 time stamp indicates that the message was accepted; if the message failed, the SMSC would reply with field 900 (error code) instead.
A good number of supporting software to implement CIMD is available from
Nokia's Website to build CIMD client. You can fire SMS from message center with the help of CIMD client tools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3412">'''Common-mode signal''' is the component of an [[analog signal]] which is present with one sign on all considered [[electrical conductor|conductor]]s. In [[telecommunication]], common-mode signal on a [[transmission line]] is known as '''longitudinal voltage'''.

In [[electronics]] where the signal is transferred by differential voltage, the common-mode signal is a half-sum of voltages

:&lt;math&gt;U_\text{cm} = \frac{U_1 + U_2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

When referenced to the local common or ground, a common-mode signal appears on both lines of a two-wire cable, in-phase and with equal amplitudes. Technically, a common-mode voltage is one-half the vector sum of the voltages from each conductor of a balanced circuit to local ground or common. Such signals can arise from one or more of the following sources:
* Radiated signals coupled equally to both lines, 
* An offset from signal common created in the driver circuit, or 
* A ground differential between the transmitting and receiving locations. 

Noise induced into a cable, or transmitted from a cable usually occurs in the common mode; i.e. the same signal tends to be picked up by both conductors in a two wire cable.  Likewise, RF noise transmitted from a cable tends to emanate from both conductors. Elimination of common mode signals on cables entering or leaving electronic equipment is important to ensure [[electromagnetic compatibility]]. Unless the intention is to transmit or receive radio signals, an electronic designer will generally design electronic circuits to minimise or eliminate common mode effects.

==Methods of eliminating common mode signals==

* [[Differential amplifier]]s or receivers that respond only to voltage differences, ''e.g.,'' those between the wires that constitute a pair. This method is particularly suited for instrumentation where signals are transmitted through DC bias.
* An inductor where a pair of signalling wires follow the same path through the inductor. E.g. in a [[bifilar winding]] configuration such as used in Ethernet magnetics.&lt;ref&gt;http://pulseeng.com/products/datasheets/H325.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Useful for AC and DC signals, but will filter only higher frequency common mode signals.
* A transformer, which is useful for AC signals only, and will filter any form of common mode noise, but may be used in combination with a bifilar wound coil to eliminate capacitive coupling of higher frequency common mode signals across the transformer. Used in twisted pair Ethernet.&lt;ref&gt;http://pulseeng.com/products/datasheets/H325.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Common mode filtering may also be used to prevent egress of noise for electromagnetic compatibility purposes.
 
High frequency common mode signals, for example, [[Radio frequency|RF]] noise from a computing circuit, may be blocked using a ferrite bead clamped to the outside of a cable. These are often observable on laptop computer power supplies near the jack socket, and good quality mouse or printer USB cables and HDMI cables.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elmac.co.uk/pdfs/ferrite.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Switched-mode power supply|Switch mode power supplies]]  include common and differential mode filtering inductors to block the switching signal noise returning into mains wiring.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hottconsultants.com/pdf_files/APEC-2002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copper extraction''' refers to the methods used to obtaining [[copper]] from [[list of copper ores|its ores]]. The conversion of copper consists of a series of chemical, physical, and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.

As in all mining operations, the [[ore]] must usually be [[beneficiation|beneficiated]] (concentrated). The processing techniques depend on the nature of the ore. If the ore is primarily sulfide copper minerals (such as [[chalcopyrite]]), the ore is [[crusher|crushed]] and ground to liberate the valuable minerals from the waste ('gangue') minerals. It is then concentrated using mineral flotation. The concentrate is typically then sold to distant smelters, although some large mines have smelters located nearby. Such colocation of mines and smelters was more typical in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when smaller smelters could be economic. The sulfide concentrates are typically smelted in such furnaces as the Outokumpo or Inco [[flash smelting|flash furnace]] or the [[ISASMELT]] furnace to produce [[matte (metallurgy)|matte]], which must be [[Copper extraction techniques#Converting|converted]] and [[Copper extraction techniques#Fire refining|refined]] to produce anode copper. Finally, the final refining process is [[electrolysis]]. For economic and environmental reasons, many of the byproducts of extraction are reclaimed. [[Sulfur dioxide]] gas, for example, is captured and turned into [[sulfuric acid]] — which can then be used in the extraction process or sold for such purposes as fertiliser manufacture.

Oxidised copper ores can be treated by [[Copper extraction techniques#Hydrometallurgical extraction|hydrometallurgical extraction]].

==History==
[[File:TamarackMiners CopperCountryMI.jpg|thumb|Miners at the [[Tamarack mine]] in [[Copper Country]], in 1905]]
The earliest evidence of cold-hammering of native copper comes from the excavation at [[Çayönü|Çaÿonü Tepesi]] in eastern [[Anatolia]], which dates between 7200 to 6600 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Beginnings of Village-Farming Communities in Southeastern Turkey|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|volume=68|issue=6|pages=1236–1240|year=1971|pmid=16591930|pmc=389161 |author1=Robert J. Braidwood |author2=Halet Çambel |author3=Charles L. Redman |author4=Patty Jo Watson |doi=10.1073/pnas.68.6.1236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the various items considered to be votive or amulets there was one that looked like a fishhook and one like an awl. Another find, at [[Shanidar Cave]] in Mergasur, Iraq, contained copper beads, dates to 8,700 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.tamupress.com/product/Proto-Neolithic-Cemetery-in-Shanidar-Cave,78.aspx|title=The Proto-neolithic Cemetery in Shanidar Cave|year=2004|author1=R.S.

The world's oldest known copper mine, as opposed to usage of surface deposits, is at [[Timna Valley]], Israel, since the fourth millennium BC, with smelting and surface deposit usage since the sixth to fifth millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zmvNogJO2ZgC&amp;pg=PA583&amp;dq=timna+valley+mines#v=onepage&amp;q=timna%20valley%20mines&amp;f=false |title=A Dictionary of Archaeology  |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |author=Ian Shaw |pages=582–583|isbn=9780631235835  |date=2002-05-06  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OtOhypZz_pEC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=timna+millennium#v=onepage&amp;q=timna%20millennium&amp;f=false |title=Life In Biblical Israel |publisher= |author1=PJ King |author2=LE Stager |page=165|isbn=9780664221485 |date=2001-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pločnik (archaeological site)|Pločnik]] archaeological site in southeastern Europe ([[Serbia]]) contains the oldest securely dated{{dubious|see Talk page|date=February 2016}} evidence of copper making at high temperature, from 5,000 BCE. The find in June 2010 extends for additional 500 years the earlier record of copper smelting from [[Rudna Glava (archaeological site)|Rudna Glava]] ([[Serbia]]), dated to 5th millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serbian site may have hosted first copper makers |date=July 17, 2010 |work=ScienceNews |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/60563/description/Serbian_site_may_have_hosted_first_copper_makers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper smelting technology gave rise to the [[Copper Age]], aka Chalcolithic Age, and then the [[Bronze Age]]. The Bronze Age would not have been possible without humans developing smelting technology.

{{Details|topic=copper ore body formation|Ore genesis#Copper}}{{See also|List of copper ores}}[[file:Evolution minerai cuivre.svg|thumb|lang=en|upright=1.75|The decreasing rate of copper in ores now requires pre-treatment of ores.]]

Most copper ores contain only a small percentage of copper metal bound up within valuable [[ore]] minerals, with the remainder of the ore being unwanted rock or [[gangue]] minerals, typically [[silicate minerals]] or oxide minerals for which there is often no value. In some cases, tailings have been retreated to recover lost value as the technology for recovering copper has improved. The average grade of copper ores in the 21st century is below 0.6% copper, with a proportion of economic ore minerals (including copper) being less than 2% of the total volume of the ore rock. A key objective in the metallurgical treatment of any ore is the separation of ore minerals from gangue minerals within the rock.

The first stage of any process within a metallurgical treatment circuit is accurate grinding or ''[[comminution]]'', where the rock is crushed to produce small particles (&lt;100 μm) consisting of individual mineral phases. These particles are then separated to remove gangue (rocks residues), thereafter followed by a process of physical liberation of the ore minerals from the rock. The process of liberation of copper ores depends upon whether they are oxide or sulfide ores.&lt;ref&gt;Adalbert Lossin "Copper" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a07_471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent steps depend on the nature of the ore containing the copper and what will be extracted. For oxide ores, a hydrometallurgical liberation process is normally undertaken, which uses the soluble nature of the ore minerals to the advantage of the metallurgical treatment plant. For sulfide ores, both secondary ([[supergene (geology)|supergene]]) and primary ([[hypogene]]), [[froth flotation]] is used to physically separate ore from gangue. For special native copper bearing ore bodies or sections of ore bodies rich in supergene native copper, this mineral can be recovered by a simple [[gravity separation|gravity circuit]].

==Froth flotation==
[[File:FlotationFalconbridgeOnt.jpg|thumb|left|Froth flotation cells to concentrate copper and nickel sulfide minerals, Falconbridge, Ontario.]]
The modern [[froth flotation]] process was independently invented the early 1900s in Australia by C.V Potter and around the same time by [[G. D. Delprat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/guides/mine/historicalnote.htm|title=Historical Note|accessdate=2007-12-30|publisher=Minerals Separation Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Prominenthill-flotation.jpg|thumb|left|Copper sulfide loaded air bubbles on a [[Jameson Cell]] at the flotation plant of the [[Prominent Hill]] mine in [[South Australia]]]]

All primary sulfide ores of copper sulfides, and most concentrates of secondary copper sulfides (being [[chalcocite]]), are subjected to [[smelting]]. Some [[vat leach]] or [[pressure leach]] processes exist to solubilise chalcocite concentrates and produce copper cathode from the resulting [[leachate]] solution, but this is a minor part of the market.

Carbonate concentrates are a relatively minor product produced from copper cementation plants, typically as the end-stage of a heap-leach operation. Such carbonate concentrates can be treated by a [[solvent extraction and electrowinning]] (SX-EW) plant or smelted.

The copper ore is [[comminution|crushed and ground]] to a size such that an acceptably high degree of liberation has occurred between the copper sulfide ore minerals and the gangue minerals. The ore is then wet, suspended in a slurry, and mixed with [[xanthates]] or other reagents, which render the sulfide particles [[hydrophobic]]. Typical reagents include [[potassium ethylxanthate]] and [[sodium ethylxanthate]], but [[dithiophosphate]]s and dithiocarbamates are also used.

The treated ore is introduced to a water-filled aeration tank containing [[surfactant]] such as [[4-Methyl-2-pentanol|methylisobutyl carbinol]] (MIBC). Air is constantly forced through the slurry and the air bubbles attach to the hydrophobic copper sulfide particles, which are conducted to the surface, where they form a froth and are skimmed off. These skimmings are generally subjected to a cleaner-scavenger cell to remove excess silicates and to remove other sulfide minerals that can deleteriously impact the concentrate quality (typically, galena), and the final concentrate sent for smelting. The rock which has not floated off in the flotation cell is either discarded as [[tailings]] or further processed to extract other metals such as lead (from [[galena]]) and zinc (from [[sphalerite]]), should they exist. To improve the process efficiency, [[Lime (material)|lime]] is used to raise the [[pH]] of the water bath, causing the collector to ionize more and to preferentially bond to [[chalcopyrite]] (CuFeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and avoid the [[pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Iron exists in both primary zone minerals. Copper ores containing chalcopyrite can be concentrated to produce a concentrate with between 20% and 30% copper-in-concentrate (usually 27–29% copper); the remainder of the concentrate is iron and sulfur in the chalcopyrite, and unwanted impurities such as silicate gangue minerals or other sulfide minerals, typically minor amounts of [[pyrite]], [[sphalerite]] or [[galena]]. Chalcocite concentrates typically grade between 37% and 40% copper-in-concentrate, as chalcocite has no iron within the mineral.

==Hydrometallurgical extraction==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}}

===Sulfide ores===
Secondary sulfides – those formed by [[Supergene (geology)|supergene]] secondary enrichment – are resistant (''[[refractory]]'') to sulfuric leaching. These ores are a mixture of copper carbonate, sulfate, phosphate, and oxide minerals and secondary sulfide minerals, dominantly [[chalcocite]] but other minerals such as [[digenite]] can be important in some deposits.

Supergene ores rich in sulfides may be concentrated using froth flotation. A typical concentrate of chalcocite can grade between 37% and 40% copper in sulfide, making them relatively cheap to smelt compared to chalcopyrite concentrates.

Some supergene sulfide deposits can be leached using a [[bacterial oxidation]] heap leach process to oxidize the sulfides to sulfuric acid, which also allows for simultaneous leaching with sulfuric acid to produce a [[copper sulfate]] solution. As with oxide ores, [[solvent extraction and electrowinning]] technologies are used to recover the copper from the [[pregnant leach solution]].

Supergene sulfide ores rich in native copper minerals are refractory to treatment with sulfuric acid leaching on all practicable time scales, and the dense metal particles do not react with froth flotation media. Typically, if native copper is a minor part of a supergene profile it will not be recovered and will report to the [[tailings]]. When rich enough, native copper ore bodies may be treated to recover the contained copper via a [[gravity separation]] circuit where the density of the metal is used to liberate it from the lighter silicate minerals. Often, the nature of the gangue is important, as clay-rich native copper ores prove difficult to liberate.

===Oxide ores===
Oxidised copper ore bodies may be treated via several processes, with hydrometallurgical processes used to treat oxide ores dominated by copper carbonate minerals such as [[azurite]] and [[malachite]], and other soluble minerals such as silicates like [[chrysocolla]], or sulfates such as [[atacamite]] and so on.

Such oxide ores are usually leached by [[sulfuric acid]], usually in a [[heap leaching]] or [[dump leaching]] process to liberate the copper minerals into a solution of sulfuric acid laden with [[copper sulfate]] in solution. The copper sulfate solution (the pregnant leach solution) is then stripped of copper via a [[solvent extraction]] and [[electrowinning]] ([[SX-EW]]) plant, with the barred (denuded) sulfuric acid recycled back on to the heaps. Alternatively, the copper can be precipitated out of the pregnant solution by contacting it with scrap iron; a process called [[Cementation (metallurgy)|cementation]]. Cement copper is normally less pure than SX-EW copper. Commonly sulfuric acid is used as a leachant for copper oxide, although it is possible to use water, particularly for ores rich in ultra-soluble sulfate minerals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In general, [[froth flotation]] is not used to concentrate copper oxide ores, as oxide minerals are not responsive to the froth flotation chemicals or process (i.e.; they do not bind to the kerosene-based chemicals). Copper oxide ores have occasionally been treated via froth flotation via [[sulfidation]] of the oxide minerals with certain chemicals which react with the oxide mineral particles to produce a thin rime of sulfide (usually chalcocite), which can then be activated by the froth flotation plant.

==Sulfide smelting==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}

Until the latter half of the 20th century, smelting sulfide ores was almost the sole means of producing copper metal from mined ores (''primary'' copper production). Davenport, et al, noted in 2002 that even then 80% of global primary copper production was from copper–iron–sulfur minerals and that the vast majority of these were treated by smelting.&lt;ref name = "Davenport"&gt;W G Davenport, M King, M Schlesinger and A K Biswas, ''Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, Fourth Edition'' (Elsevier Science Limited: Kidlington, Oxford, England, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper was initially recovered from sulfide ores by directly smelting the ore in a furnace.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Raymond, ''Out of the Fiery Furnace'', The MacMillan Company of Australia Pty Ltd, Melbourne, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; The smelters were initially located near the mines to minimize the cost of transport. This avoided the prohibitive costs of transporting the waste minerals and the sulfur and iron present in the copper-containing minerals. However, as the concentration of copper in the ore bodies decreased, the energy costs of smelting the whole ore also became prohibitive, and it became necessary to concentrate the ores first.

Initial concentration techniques included hand-sorting&lt;ref name = "Gill32"&gt;C B Gill, ''Non-ferrous Extractive Metallurgy'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1980) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and gravity concentration. They resulted in high losses of copper. Consequently, the development of the froth flotation process was a major step forward in mineral processing.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Raymond (1984) ''Out of the Fiery Furnace'', The MacMillan Company of Australia Pty Ltd, Melbourne, pp. 233–235, {{ISBN|027100441X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It made possible the development of the giant [[Bingham Canyon mine]] in Utah.&lt;ref&gt;"BP Minerals completes $400 million modernization at Bingham Canyon," ''Mining Engineering'', November 1988, 1017–1020.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century, most ores were concentrated before smelting. Smelting was initially undertaken using [[sinter plant]]s and [[blast furnace]]s,&lt;ref&gt;S A Bradford (1989) "The historical development of copper smelting in British Columbia," in: ''All that Glitters: Readings in Historical Metallurgy'', Ed. Michael L. Wayman, The Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Montreal, pp. 162–165, {{ISBN|0919086241}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or with roasters and [[reverberatory furnace]]s.&lt;ref&gt;E Kossatz and P J Mackey (1989) "The first copper smelter in Canada," in: ''All that Glitters: Readings in Historical Metallurgy'', Ed. Michael L. Wayman, The Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Montreal, pp. 160–161, {{ISBN|0919086241}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Roasting and reverberatory furnace smelting dominated primary copper production until the 1960s.&lt;ref name = "Davenport"/&gt;

===Roasting===
{{See also|Roasting (metallurgy)}}

The roasting process is generally undertaken in combination with [[reverberatory furnace]]s. In the roaster, the copper concentrate is partially oxidised to produce "[[calcine]]" and [[sulfur dioxide]] gas. The [[stoichiometry]] of the reaction which occurs is:
:2 CuFeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 FeO + 2 CuS + 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Roasting generally leaves more sulfur in the calcined product (15% in the case of the roaster at [[Mount Isa Mines]]&lt;ref&gt;B V Borgelt, G E Casley and J Pritchard (1974) "Fluid bed roasting at Mount Isa," ''The Aus.I.M.M. North West Queensland Branch, Regional Meeting, August 1974''. The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, pp. 123–130.&lt;/ref&gt;) than a sinter plant leaves in the sintered product (about 7% in the case of the Electrolytic Refining and Smelting smelter&lt;ref&gt;P J Wand (1980) "Copper smelting at Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Company of Australia Ltd., Port Kembla, N.S.W.", in: '' Mining and Metallurgical Practices in Australasia: The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume'', Ed J T Woodcock. The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne. pp. 335–340.&lt;/ref&gt;).

As of 2005, roasting is no longer common in copper concentrate treatment, because its combination with reverberatory furnaces is not energy efficient and the SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the roaster offgas is too dilute for cost-effective capture.&lt;ref name = "Davenport"/&gt; Direct smelting is now favored, e.g. using the following smelting technologies: [[flash smelting]], [[Isasmelt]], Noranda, Mitsubishi or El Teniente furnaces.&lt;ref name = "Davenport"/&gt;

===Smelting===

[[file:Evolution copper smelting.svg|thumb|lang=en|upright=1.5|Replacement of reverberatory furnace smelting by flash smelting, related to the number of copper smelters using this technology.]]

The initial melting of the material to be smelted is usually referred to as the ''[[Smelting#Copper and bronze|smelting]]'' or ''matte smelting'' stage. It can be undertaken in a variety of furnaces, including the largely obsolete [[blast furnace]]s and [[reverberatory furnace]]s, as well as [[Flash smelting|flash furnaces]], [[Isasmelt]] furnaces, etc.&lt;ref name = "Davenport"/&gt; The product of this smelting stage is a mixture of copper, iron and sulfur that is enriched in copper, and which is called ''[[Matte (metallurgy)|matte]]'' or ''copper matte''.&lt;ref name = "Davenport"/&gt; The term ''matte grade'' is normally used to refer to the copper content of the matte.&lt;ref name = "Smelting"/&gt;

The purpose of the matte smelting stage is to eliminate as much of the unwanted iron, sulfur and ''gangue'' minerals (such as silica, magnesia, alumina and limestone) as possible, while minimizing the loss of copper.&lt;ref name = "Smelting"&gt;W G Davenport, M King, M Schlesinger and A K Biswas, ''Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, Fourth Edition'' (Elsevier Science Limited: Kidlington, Oxford, England, 2002), 57–72.&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved by reacting iron sulfides with oxygen (in air or oxygen enriched air) to produce iron oxides (mainly as [[FeO]], but with some [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)) and [[sulfur dioxide]].&lt;ref name = "Smelting"/&gt;

Copper sulfide and iron oxide can mix, but when sufficient silica is added, a separate [[slag]] layer is formed.&lt;ref name = "Hayes173"&gt;P C Hayes, ''Process Principles in Minerals and Materials Production'' (Hayes Publishing Company: Brisbane, 1993), 173–179.&lt;/ref&gt; Adding silica also reduces the melting point (or, more properly, the [[liquidus]] temperature) of the slag, meaning that the smelting process can be operated at a lower temperature.&lt;ref name = "Hayes173"/&gt;

The slag forming reaction is:

:FeO + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → FeO.SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name = "Smelting"/&gt;

Slag is less dense than matte, so it forms a layer that floats on top of the matte.&lt;ref&gt;C B Gill, ''Non-ferrous Extractive Metallurgy'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1980) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper can be lost from the matte in three ways: as [[cuprous oxide]] (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) dissolved in the slag,&lt;ref&gt;R Altman and H H Kellogg, "Solubility of copper in silica-saturated iron silicate slag," ''Transactions of the [[Institution of Mining and Metallurgy]] (Section C: Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy),'' '''81''', September 1972, C163–C175.&lt;/ref&gt; as sulfide copper dissolved in the slag&lt;ref name = "Nagamori"&gt;{{cite journal|author=M Nagamori|doi=10.1007/BF02644646|title=Metal loss to slag: Part I. Sulfidic and oxidic dissolution of copper in fayalite slag from low grade matte|year=1974|journal=Metallurgical Transactions|volume=5|issue=3|pages=531–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as tiny droplets (or ''[[prills]]'') of matte suspended in the slag.&lt;ref&gt;A Yazawa and S Nakazawa, "Evaluation of non-equilibrium minor components in pyrometallurgy," in: ''EPD Congress 1998'', Ed. B Mishra (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1998), 641–655.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Elliott"&gt;B J Elliott, J B See, and W J Rankin, "Effect of slag composition on copper losses to silica-saturated iron silicate slags," ''Transactions of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy (Section C: Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy),'' September 1978, C–C211.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of copper lost as oxide copper increases as the oxygen potential of the slag increases.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; The oxygen potential generally increases as the copper content of the matte is increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J Matousek|title=Oxygen potentials of copper smelting slags|journal=[[Canadian Metallurgical Quarterly]]|volume=32|issue=2|year= 1993|pages= 97–101|doi=10.1179/cmq.1993.32.2.97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the loss of copper as oxide increases as the copper content of the matte increases.&lt;ref name = "Mackey"&gt;{{cite journal|author=P J Mackey|doi=10.1179/000844311X13112418194806|title=The Physical Chemistry of Copper Smelting Slags and Copper Losses at the Paipote SmelterPart 2 – Characterisation of industrial slags|year=2011|journal=Canadian Metallurgical Quarterly|volume=50|issue=4|pages=330–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the solubility of sulfidic copper in slag decreases as the copper content of the matte increases beyond about 40%.&lt;ref name = "Nagamori"/&gt; Nagamori calculated that more than half the copper dissolved in slags from mattes containing less than 50% copper is sulfidic copper. Above this figure, oxidic copper begins to dominate.&lt;ref name = "Nagamori"/&gt;

The loss of copper as prills suspended in the slag depends on the size of the prills, the viscosity of the slag and the settling time available.&lt;ref name = "Rosenqvist"/&gt; Rosenqvist suggested that about half the copper losses to slag were due to suspended prills.&lt;ref name = "Rosenqvist"&gt;T Rosenqvist, T (2004) ''Principles of Extractive Metallurgy, Second Edition'', Tapir Academic Press: Trondheim, p. 331, {{ISBN|8251919223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mass of slag generated in the smelting stage depends on the iron content of the material fed into the smelting furnace and the target matte grade. The greater the iron content of the feed, the more iron that will need to be rejected to the slag for a given matte grade. Similarly, increasing the target matte grade requires the rejection of more iron and an increase in the slag volume.

Thus, the two factors that most affect the loss of copper to slag in the smelting stage are:
* matte grade
* mass of slag.&lt;ref name = "Hayes173"/&gt;

This means that there is a practical limit on how high the matte grade can be if the loss of copper to slag is to be minimized. Therefore, further stages of processing (converting and fire refining) are required.

The following subsections briefly describe some of the processes used in matte smelting.

====Reverberatory furnace smelting====

Reverberatory furnaces are long furnaces can treat wet, dry or roasted concentrate.&lt;ref name = "Davenport"/&gt; Most of the reverberatory furnaces used in the latter years treated roasted concentrate because putting dry feed materials into the reverberatory furnace is more energy efficient, and because the elimination of some of the sulfur in the roaster results in higher matte grades.&lt;ref name = "Davenport"/&gt;

The reverberatory furnace feed is added to the furnace through feed holes along the sides of the furnace.&lt;ref name = "Davenport"/&gt; Additional silica is normally added to help form the slag. The furnace is fired with burners using pulverized coal, fuel oil or natural gas&lt;ref name = "Gill"&gt;C B Gill, ''Non-ferrous Extractive Metallurgy'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1980) pp. 29–35&lt;/ref&gt; and the solid charge is melted.

Reverberatory furnaces can additionally be fed with molten slag from the later converting stage to recover the contained copper and other materials with a high copper content.&lt;ref name = "Gill"/&gt;

Because the reverberatory furnace bath is quiescent, very little oxidation of the feed occurs (and thus very little sulfur is eliminated from the concentrate). It is essentially a melting process.&lt;ref name = "Rosenqvist"/&gt; Consequently, wet-charged reverberatory furnaces have less copper in their matte product than calcine-charged furnaces, and they also have lower copper losses to slag.&lt;ref name = "Gill"/&gt; Gill quotes a copper in slag value of 0.23% for a wet-charged reverberatory furnace vs 0.37% for a calcine-charged furnace.&lt;ref name = "Gill"/&gt;

In the case of calcine-charged furnaces, a significant portion of the sulfur has been eliminated during the roasting stage, and the calcine consists of a mixture of copper and iron oxides and sulfides. The reverberatory furnace acts to allow these species to approach chemical equilibrium at the furnace [[operating temperature]] (approximately 1600&amp;nbsp;°C at the burner end of the furnace and about 1200&amp;nbsp;°C at the flue end;&lt;ref&gt;C B Gill, ''Non-ferrous Extractive Metallurgy'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1980) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; the matte is about 1100&amp;nbsp;°C and the slag is about 1195&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name = "Gill"/&gt;). In this equilibration process, oxygen associated with copper compounds exchanges with sulfur associated with iron compounds, increasing the iron oxide content of the furnace, and the iron oxides interact with silica and other oxide materials to form the slag.&lt;ref name = "Gill"/&gt;

The main equilibration reaction is:

:Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + FeS = Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + FeO&lt;ref name = "Gill"/&gt;

The slag and the matte form distinct layers that can be removed from the furnace as separate streams. The slag layer is periodically allowed to flow through a hole in the wall of the furnace above the height of the matte layer. The matte is removed by draining it through a hole into ladles for it to be carried by crane to the converters.&lt;ref name = "Gill"/&gt; This draining process is known as ''tapping'' the furnace.&lt;ref name = "Gill"/&gt; The matte taphole is normally a hole through a water-cooled copper block that prevents erosion of the [[refractory|refractory bricks]] lining the furnace. When the removal of the matte or slag is complete, the hole is normally plugged with clay, which is removed when the furnace is ready to be tapped again.

Reverberatory furnaces were often used to treat molten converter slag to recover contained copper.&lt;ref name = "Gill"/&gt; This would be poured into the furnaces from ladles carried by cranes. However, the converter slag is high in magnetite&lt;ref name = "Casley"&gt;G E Casley, J Middlin and D White, "Recent developments in reverberatory furnace and converter practice at the Mount Isa Mines copper smelter," in: ''Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, Volume 1,'' (The Metallurgical Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1976), 117–138.&lt;/ref&gt; and some of this magnetite would precipitate from the converter slag (due to its higher melting point), forming an accretion on the hearth of the reverberatory furnace and necessitating shut downs of the furnace to remove the accretion.&lt;ref name = "Casley"/&gt; This accretion formation limits the quantity of converter slag that can be treated in a reverberatory furnace.&lt;ref name = "Casley"/&gt;

While reverberatory furnaces have very low copper losses to slag, they are not very energy-efficient and the low concentrations of sulfur dioxide in their offgases make its capture uneconomic.&lt;ref name = "Davenport"/&gt; Consequently, smelter operators devoted a lot of money in the 1970s and 1980s to developing new, more efficient copper smelting processes.&lt;ref name = "Mackey1983"&gt;P J Mackey and P Tarassoff, "New and emerging technologies in sulphide [sic] smelting," in: ''Advances in Sulfide Smelting Volume 2: Technology and Practice'', Eds H Y Sohn, D B George and A D Zunkel (The Metallurgical Society of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1983), 399–426.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, flash smelting technologies had been developed in earlier years and began to replace reverberatory furnaces. By 2002, 20 of the 30 reverberatory furnaces still operating in 1994 had been shut down.&lt;ref name = "Davenport"/&gt;

====Flash furnace smelting====

In [[flash smelting]], the concentrate is dispersed in an air or oxygen stream and the smelting reactions are largely completed while the mineral particles are still in flight.&lt;ref name = "Mackey1983"/&gt; The reacted particles then settle in a bath at the bottom of the furnace, where they behave as does calcine in a reverberatory furnace.&lt;ref name = "Flash"&gt;W G Davenport, M King, M Schlesinger and A K Biswas, ''Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, Fourth Edition'' (Elsevier Science Limited: Kidlington, Oxford, England, 2002), 73–102.&lt;/ref&gt; A slag layer forms on top of the matte layer, and they can separately be tapped from the furnace.&lt;ref name = "Flash"/&gt;

===Converting===
[[File:Tough-Pitch Copper Containing Antimony And Nickel.jpg|thumb|[[Oxygen-free copper]] aka "Tough-pitch" copper (ca. 98% pure), containing antimony and nickel]]
The matte, which is produced in the smelter, contains 30–70% copper (depending on the process used and the operating philosophy of the smelter), primarily as copper sulfide, as well as iron sulfide. The sulfur is removed at high temperature as sulfur dioxide by blowing air through molten matte:
:2 CuS + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CuO + 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:CuS + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Cu + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In a parallel reaction the iron sulfide is converted to slag:

:2 FeS + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 FeO + 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:2 FeO + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

The purity of this product is 98%, it is known as ''blister'' because of the broken surface created by the escape of sulfur dioxide gas as blister copper ''pigs'' or [[ingot]]s are cooled. By-products generated in the process are sulfur dioxide and [[slag]]. The sulfur dioxide is captured for use in earlier leaching processes.

===Fire refining===
The blister copper is put into an [[anode furnace]], a furnace that refines the blister copper to anode-grade copper in two stages by removing most of the remaining sulfur and iron, and then removing oxygen introduced during the first stage. This second stage, often referred to as ''[[poling (metallurgy)|poling]]'' is done by blowing [[natural gas]], or some other reducing agent, through the molten copper oxide. When this flame burns green, indicating the copper oxidation spectrum, the oxygen has mostly been burned off. This creates copper at about 99% pure. The anodes produced from this are fed to the electrorefinery.

===Electrorefining===
[[File:CuElectrolyticRefineApparatus.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Apparatus for electrolytic refining of copper]]
{{main|Electrowinning}}
The copper is refined by [[electrolysis]]. The anodes cast from processed blister copper are placed into an [[aqueous]] solution of 3–4% [[Copper(II) sulfate|copper sulfate]] and 10–16% [[sulfuric acid]]. Cathodes are thin rolled sheets of highly pure copper or, more commonly these days, reusable stainless steel starting sheets (as in the [[IsaKidd refining technology|IsaKidd process]]).&lt;ref name = "Robinson"&gt;T Robinson, "Electrolytic refining," in: ''Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, Fourth Edition'', Eds W G Davenport, M King, M Schlesinger and A K Biswas (Elsevier Science Limited: Kidlington, Oxford, England, 2002) 265–288.&lt;/ref&gt;  A potential of only 0.2–0.4 volts is required for the process to commence. At the anode, copper and less noble metals dissolve. More noble metals such as [[silver]], [[gold]], [[selenium]], and [[tellurium]] settle to the bottom of the cell as [[anode slime]], which forms a salable byproduct. Copper(II) ions migrate through the electrolyte to the cathode. At the cathode, copper metal plates out, but less noble constituents such as [[arsenic]] and [[zinc]] remain in solution unless a higher voltage is used.&lt;ref name="samans"&gt;Samans, Carl H. ''Engineering Metals and their Alloys'' MacMillan 1949&lt;/ref&gt; The reactions are:

At the [[anode]]: Cu&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; → Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

At the [[cathode]]: Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Cu&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt;

==Concentrate and copper marketing==

Copper concentrates produced by mines are sold to smelters and refiners who treat the ore and refine the copper and charge for this service via treatment charges (TCs) and refining charges (RCs). The TCs are charged in US$ per tonne of concentrate treated and RCs are charged in cents per pound treated, denominated in US dollars, with benchmark prices set annually by major Japanese smelters. The customer in this case can be a smelter, who on-sells blister copper ingots to a refiner, or a smelter-refiner which is vertically integrated.

One prevalent form of copper concentrate contains gold and silver, like the one produced by Bougainville Copper Limited from the Panguna mine from the early 1970s to the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcl.com.pg/about-us/about-the-company/ |title=About the Company |accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical contract for a miner is denominated against the London Metal Exchange price, minus the TC-RCs and any applicable penalties or credits. Penalties may be assessed against copper concentrates according to the level of deleterious elements such as [[arsenic]], [[bismuth]], [[lead]] or [[tungsten]]. Because a large portion of copper sulfide ore bodies contain [[silver]] or [[gold]] in appreciable amounts, a credit can be paid to the miner for these metals if their concentration ''within the concentrate'' is above a certain amount. Usually the refiner or smelter charges the miner a fee based on the concentration; a typical contract will specify that a credit is due for every ounce of the metal in the concentrate above a certain concentration; below that, if it is recovered, the smelter will keep the metal and sell it to defray costs.

Copper concentrate is traded either via [[spot contract]]s or under long term contracts as an intermediate product in its own right. Often the smelter sells the copper metal itself on behalf of the miner. The miner is paid the price at the time that the smelter-refiner makes the sale, not at the price on the date of delivery of the concentrate. Under a Quotational Pricing system, the price is agreed to be at a fixed date in the future, typically 90 days from time of delivery to the smelter.

A-grade [[copper cathode]] is of 99.99% copper in sheets that are 1&amp;nbsp;cm thick, and approximately 1 meter square weighing approximately 200 pounds. It is a true [[commodity]], deliverable to and tradeable upon the metal exchanges in [[New York City]] (COMEX), [[London]] (London Metals Exchange) and [[Shanghai]] (Shanghai Futures Exchange). Often copper cathode is traded upon the exchanges indirectly via warrants, options, or swap contracts such that the majority of copper is traded upon the LME/COMEX/SFE but delivery is achieved directly, logistically moving the physical copper, and transferring the copper sheet from the physical warehouses themselves.

The chemical specification for [[electrolyte|electrolytic]] grade copper is ASTM B 115-00 (a standard that specifies the purity and maximum electrical resistivity of the product).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3167">A '''cranked eye bolt''' is an [[eye bolt]] typically used as a structural [[tie down]] &lt;ref&gt;Note: Tie down: As part of a system of interacting components to secure the building, from the roof down to the footings, to the foundation material&lt;/ref&gt; in [[building construction]] where the eye of the bolt must be fastened to a point that cannot be directly below where the shaft would otherwise be fastened. This often occurs where a [[Beam (structure)|bearer]] must be tied down to a post or column but the bearer cannot be directly fastened to the post of column.

It has a shaft which is ''cranked'', or bent twice: once off center, and a second time to bring the shaft back parallel to the original shaft.

==Uses==
[[Image:Welded eye shallow cranked bolt in profile.jpg|600px|right|thumb|Welded eye shallow cranked eye bolt in profile]]
The requirement for an offset tie down will occur when vermin proofing must be placed between the column or post, and a wooden bearer, for example to stop [[termite]]s travelling up through a concrete or wooden post or column directly into the bearer and the rest of the building.  The "ant capping", typically a 0.5mm to 0.8mm thick galvanised steel sheet, must be placed between the post and the bearer overlapping the perimeter of the post by approximately 20mm to 40mm or more.  The cranked eye bolt is fastened to the post using a bolt though the eye, the crank in the shaft allowing the shaft to be positioned so that it does not impede the overlap of the "ant capping" up through the bearer.

Should termite attack occur, the post of column can be replaced with no structural effect to the building.

Cranked eye bolts can also be used to tie the top plate of a house frame directly to house supports, using rod couplers and steel extension rods.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Engineering ==
Cranked eye bolts used to be made by bending an "eye" into the end of a rod that was threaded at the other end.

Today, cranked eye bolts are now typically made by welding a cranked and threaded rod to a heavy gauge steel washer.

Cranked eye bolts are made with different degrees of crank and lengths of shaft for flexibility.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8420">The '''Deal–Grove model''' mathematically describes the growth of an [[oxide]] layer on the surface of a material.  In particular, it is used to predict and interpret [[thermal oxidation]] of [[silicon]] in [[semiconductor device fabrication]].&lt;ref name="slo"&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Liu| first1=M.| last2= Peng |first2=J.| display-authors= etal |title=  Two-dimensional modeling of the self-limiting oxidation in silicon and tungsten nanowires | journal= Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Letters  | year= 2016 |  volume=6 | issue=5 | pages=195–199 | url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306273009_Two-dimensional_modeling_of_the_self-limiting_oxidation_in_silicon_and_tungsten_nanowires | doi= 10.1016/j.taml.2016.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model was first published in 1965 by Bruce Deal and [[Andrew Grove]], of [[Fairchild Semiconductor]].

== Physical assumptions ==
[[File:Deal-Grove.png|right|The three phenomena of oxidation, as described in the article text]]
The model assumes that [[redox|oxidation]] [[chemical reaction|reaction]] occurs at the interface between the oxide layer and the substrate material, rather than between the oxide and the ambient [[gas]].&lt;ref name="slo"/&gt;  Thus, it considers three phenomena that the oxidizing species undergoes, in this order:

# It [[diffusion|diffuses]] from the bulk of the ambient gas to the surface.
# It diffuses through the existing oxide layer to the oxide-substrate interface.
# It reacts with the substrate.

The model assumes that each of these stages proceeds at a rate proportional to the oxidant's concentration.  In the first case, this means [[Henry's law]]; in the second, [[Fick's law of diffusion]]; in the third, a [[Rate equation#First-order reactions|first-order reaction]] with respect to the oxidant.  It also assumes [[steady state]] conditions, i.e. that transient effects do not appear.

== Results ==
Given these assumptions, the [[flux]] of oxidant through each of the three phases can be expressed in terms of concentrations, material properties, and temperature.

:&lt;math&gt;J_{gas} = h_g (C_g- C_s)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_{oxide} = D_{ox} \frac{C_s- C_i}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_{reacting} = k_i C_i&lt;/math&gt;

By setting the three fluxes equal to each other, each may be found.  In turn, the growth rate may be found readily from the oxidant reaction flux.

:&lt;math&gt;J_{gas} = J_{oxide} = J_{reacting} = \frac {C_g}{\frac{1}{k_i}+\frac{x}{D_{ox}}+\frac{1}{h_g}}&lt;/math&gt;

In practice, the ambient gas (stage 1) does not limit the reaction rate, so this part of the equation is often dropped.  This simplification yields a simple quadratic equation for the oxide thickness.  For oxide growing on an initially bare substrate, the thickness ''X&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' at time ''t'' is given by the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{X_o^2}{B} + \frac{X_o}{B/A} - \tau&lt;/math&gt;
where the constants &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; encapsulate the properties of the reaction and the oxide layer, respectively, and the constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; takes into account any initial oxide thickness present. These constants are given as:
:&lt;math&gt;A=2 D_{ox} (\frac{1}{k_i} + \frac{1}{h_g})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B= \frac {2D_{ox} C_s}{N_i} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \frac{X_o^2 + A X_o}{B} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; C_s = H P_g &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; H  &lt;/math&gt; being the gas solubility parameter of the [[Henry's law]] and &lt;math&gt; P_g &lt;/math&gt; is the partial pressure of the diffusing gas. &lt;Math&gt; N_i &lt;/math&gt; denotes the oxidant molecules/unit volume needed to produce a unit volume of the oxide.

Solving the quadratic equation for ''X&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' yields:
:&lt;math&gt;X_o(t) = \frac{-A+\sqrt{{A^2}+4(B)(t+\tau)}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the short and long time limits of the above equation reveals two main modes of operation:
:&lt;math&gt;t+\tau \ll \frac{A^2}{4B} \Rightarrow X_o(t) = \frac{B}{A}(t+\tau)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t+\tau \gg \frac{A^2}{4B} \Rightarrow X_o(t) = \sqrt{B(t+\tau)}&lt;/math&gt;

Because they appear in these equations, the quantities ''B'' and ''B/A'' are often called the ''quadratic'' and ''linear reaction rate constants''.  They depend exponentially on temperature, like this:
:&lt;math&gt;B = B_0 e^{-E_A/kT}; \quad B/A = (B/A)_0 e^{-E_A/kT} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[activation energy]] and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann Constant]] in eV.  &lt;math&gt;E_A&lt;/math&gt; differs from one equation to the other.  The following table lists the values of the four parameters for single-[[crystal]] silicon under conditions typically used in industry (low [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]], [[atmosphere (unit)|atmospheric]] [[pressure]]).  The linear rate constant depends on the orientation of the crystal (usually indicated by the [[Miller indices]] of the crystal plane facing the surface).  The table gives values for &lt;100&gt; and &lt;111&gt; silicon.

== Validity for silicon ==
The Deal–Grove model works very well for single-crystal silicon under most conditions.  However, experimental data shows that very thin oxides (less than about 25 nanometres) grow much more quickly in &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; than the model predicts. In silicon nanostructures (e.g. [[Silicon Nanowire]]s) this rapid growth is generally followed by diminishing oxidation kinetics in a process known as self-limiting oxidation, necessitating a modification of the Deal–Grove model.&lt;ref name="slo"/&gt;

If the oxide grown in a particular oxidation step will significantly exceed 25&amp;nbsp;nm, a simple adjustment accounts for the aberrant growth rate.  The model yields accurate results for thick oxides if, instead of assuming zero initial thickness (or any initial thickness less than 25&amp;nbsp;nm), we assume that 25&amp;nbsp;nm of oxide exists before oxidation begins.  However, for oxides near to or thinner than this threshold, more sophisticated models must be used.

In the 1980s, it became obvious that an update to the Deal-Grove Model would be necessary to model the aforementioned thin oxides (self-limiting cases). One such approach more accurately models thin oxides is the Massoud Model from 1985 [2]. The Massoud Model is analytical and based on parallel oxidation mechanisms. It changes the parameters of Deal-Grove Model to better model the initial oxide growth with the addition of rate enhancement terms. 

Deal-Grove also fails for polycrystalline silicon ("poly-silicon").  First, the random orientation of the crystal grains makes it difficult to choose a value for the linear rate constant.  Second, oxidant molecules diffuse rapidly along grain boundaries, so that poly-silicon oxidizes more rapidly than single-crystal silicon.

[[Dopant]] atoms strain the silicon lattice, and make it easier for silicon atoms to bond with incoming oxygen.  This effect may be neglected in many cases, but heavily doped silicon oxidizes significantly faster.  The pressure of the ambient gas also affects oxidation rate.

'''National Agriculture Market''' or '''eNAM''' is an online trading platform for agricultural commodities in India. The market facilitate farmers, traders and buyers with online trading in commodities. The market is helping in better price discovery and provide facilities for smooth marketing of their produce. The market transactions stood at ₹36,200 crores by January 2018, mostly intra-market. Over 90 commodities including staple food grains, vegetables and fruits are currently listed in its list of commodities available for trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=List of Commodities |url=http://www.enam.gov.in/NAM/home/commodity.html# |work=NAM |date=14 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eNAM markets are proving popular as the crops are weighed immediately and the stock is lifted on the same day and the payments are cleared online. In February 2018, some attractive features like [[Management Information System|MIS dashboard]], [[BHIM]] and other mobile payments, enhanced features on the mobile app such as gate entry and payment through mobile phones and farmers database is helping adoption even more. The present trading is done mostly for intra-market, but in phases, it will be rolled out to trade in inter-market, inter-state, creating a unified national market for agricultural commodities.

==History==
It was launched by Ministry of Agriculture, [[Government of India]]. The electronic market pilot across India was launched on 14 April 2016 by [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Narendra Modi]]. The Portal is managed by Small Farmers’ Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) with technology provider, NFCL’s  iKisan division.
A similar project was initiated by the Congress government in the State of [[Karnataka]], during UPA tenure and had been a great success. NDA government has rolled it out nationally.

==The Market==
On the eNAM platform, farmers can opt to trade directly on their own through mobile app or through registered commission agents.

The eNAM is linked with 585 markets ([[APMC]]s) in 16 states and 2 union territory, with over 45 lakh farmer membership in 15 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=What’s in National Agriculture Market? |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/whats-in-national-agriculture-market |work=[[The Indian Express]] |date=14 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The market is helping traders and exporters in procuring quality produce in bulk, at one place and ensure transparent financial transactions.

The Government plans to connect over 22,000 [[GrAM]]s, local farmers markets, with the platform. To provide better grading and assaying services, the Agriculture Department is looking at looping in [[AGMARK]] for better certification.

==Technology==
The trading is done online, with trading computers or through mobile app in all e-nam markets.

===Mobile App===
An eNAM mobile application is available on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] for farmers and traders to bid and complete a transact on the app, available in 8 languages.

===Payment===
The payment network RTGS/NEFT, debit card and internet banking was also integrated into the app. In 2017 mobile payment, [[Unified Payment Interface]] (UPI) facility through [[BHIM]] support was added in the app.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/agri-business/in-enam-reboot-govt-introduces-six-new-features/article22818408.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gate entry===
The mobile phone gate entry, integration of farmers database and e-learning module is available. The agents are mostly using the eNAM mobile App for trading on behalf of farmers.

The critical operation of gate entry from e-NAM mobile app helps facilitate the farmers to do advance gate entry on mobile app, which in turn will reduce a lot of time for farmers coming into the market and will bring huge efficiency and facilitate smooth arrival recording at the gate.

A new feature has been introduced for farmers, where they can see the progress of their lot being traded and also real time bidding progress of price will be visible to farmers on their mobile app.

==Adoption==
The [[Management Information System|MIS dashboard]] was introduced in February 2018, to give a greater insight into the performance of each market (mandi) in terms of arrival and trade in commodities.

The six States with the most eNAMs as of March 2018 are Uttar Pradesh – 100, Madhya Pradesh – 58, Haryana - 54, Maharashtra – 60, Gujarat – 49 and Telangana – 48.

==Objectives==
* A national e-market platform for transparent sale transactions and price discovery initially in regulated markets. Willing States to accordingly enact suitable provisions in their APMC Act for promotion of e-trading by their State Agricultural Marketing Board/APMC.
* Liberal licensing of traders / buyers and commission agents by State authorities without any pre-condition of physical presence or possession of shop /premises in the market yard.
* One license for a trader valid across all markets in the State.
* Harmonisation of quality standards of agricultural produce and provision for assaying (quality testing) infrastructure in every market to enable informed bidding by buyers. Common tradable parameters have so far been developed for 25 commodities.
* Single point levy of market fees, i.e. on the first wholesale purchase from the farmer.
* Provision of Soil Testing Laboratories in/ or near the selected mandi to facilitate visiting farmers to access this facility in the mandi itself. M/s. Nagarjuna Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd. is the Strategic Partner (SP) who is responsible for development, operation and maintenance of the platform. The broad role of the Strategic Partner is comprehensive and includes writing of the software, customizing it to meet the specific requirements of the mandis in the States willing to integrate with NAM and running the platform

==Implementing Agency==
Small Farmers’ Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) is the lead promoter of NAM. SFAC is a registered society of Department of Agriculture, Cooperation &amp; Farmers’ Welfare (DAC&amp;FW) under Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare. SFAC through open tender selected Nagarjuna Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd / Ikisan Division as Strategic Partner (SP) to develop, operate and maintain the NAM e-platform. SFAC implements NAM with the technical support of SP and budgetary grant support from DAC&amp;FW. DAC&amp;FW meets the expenses on software and its customization for the States and is providing it for free. DAC&amp;FW is also giving a grant as one time fixed cost up to ₹30 lakhs per Mandi (other than to the private mandis) for installation of the e-market platform. Around 6500 APMCs operate throughout the country of which 585 district level mandis in States/UTs desirous of joining are planned to be linked by NAM. 470 mandis are planned to be integrated by March 2017 and the remaining by March 2018.

==Funds Allocation==
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had approved a Central Sector Scheme for Promotion of National Agricultural Market through Agri-Tech Infrastructure Fund (ATIF). The government has allocated ₹200 crores to the newly created ATIF. With this fund SFAC will implement NAM for three years from 2015-16 to 2017-18. Each market is given ₹30 lakhs by the department.

==Advantages for various stakeholders==

*Farmers: They can sell produce without the interference of any brokers or middlemen thereby making competitive returns out of their investment.
*Traders: Traders will be able to do secondary trading from one APMC to another one anywhere in India. Local traders can get access to larger national market for secondary trading.
*Buyers, Processers &amp; Exporters

Buyers like large retailers, processors or exporters will be able to source commodities from any mandi in India thereby reducing the inter-mediation cost.Their physical presence and dependence on intermediaries will not be needed.

*Consumers 
NAM will increase the number of traders and the competition among them increases. This translates into stable prices and availability to the consumers.

*Mandis 
There will be reduction in book keeping and reporting system as it will be generated automatically. Monitoring and regulation of traders and commission agents becomes easy. Transparency in the process eliminates the scope of manipulation of tendering/auctioning process. Market allocation fee will increase due to accounting of all transactions taking place in the market. It will reduce the manpower requirements as the tendering/auctioning process is carried out electronically. For instance, the system declares the winner of lots within few seconds. It eliminates information asymmetry as all the activities of an APMC can be known directly from the website.

*Others 
NAM aims to improve the marketing aspect of the agriculture sector. With one license for the entire state and single point levy, an entire state becomes a market and the market fragmentation within the same state gets abolished. It will improve the supply chain of commodities and reduces wastages.

'''Eric Henry Stoneley Burhop''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|size=100%|FRS}} (31 January 1911{{spaced ndash}}22 January 1980) was an Australian [[physicist]] and [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]].

A graduate of the [[University of Melbourne]], Burhop was awarded an [[1851 Exhibition Scholarship]] to study at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] under [[Lord Rutherford]]. Under the supervision of [[Mark Oliphant]], he investigated [[nuclear fusion]]. He produced a non-relativistic theory of the [[Auger effect]] in 1935, followed by a relativistic treatment the following year. He later wrote a monograph on the subject. He returned to the [[University of Melbourne]] as a [[lecturer]] in 1936, and helped Professor [[Thomas Laby]] build up the physics department there.

During the Second World War he worked in the Radiophysics Laboratory in [[Sydney]], where he produced a laboratory model of a [[cavity magnetron]]. In September 1942, he returned to Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, where he continued the development of cavity magnetrons and [[reflex klystron]]s for [[radar]] sets. In May 1944, he became one of three Australian physicists who worked on the [[Manhattan Project]], which created the first [[atomic bomb]]s.

In early 1945, [[Harrie Massey]] offered Burhop a position as a lecturer in the Mathematics Department at [[University College, London]]. He fostered international cooperation in nuclear physics. As part of a five-nation study of [[K meson]]s and their interaction with atomic nuclei that went on for several years, his group produced a wealth of new results, including the first observation of a double lambda [[hypernucleus]]. He spent a year on secondment to [[CERN]], as secretary of a committee that recommended the construction of the [[Intersecting Storage Rings]] and the [[Super Proton Synchrotron]]. In 1974 and 1975, an international team under his leadership carried out a successful search for the {{SubatomicParticle|Charmed Lambda+}} (charmed [[lambda baryon]]).

== Early life ==
Eric Henry Stoneley Burhop was born in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], on 31 January 1911, the third child of two [[Salvation Army officer]]s, Henry Augustus Burhop and his wife Bertha née Head.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; He had two older sisters, Edna and Vera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11361845 |title=Family Notices |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]  |date=20 September 1944 |accessdate=24 February 2015 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His family was not wealthy, and they moved frequently owing to the nature of his parents' evangelical work.&lt;ref name="adb"&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography  | last = Home | first = R. W. |authorlink=Roderick Weir Home| year = 1983 | id2= burhop-eric-henry-stoneley-9627 | title= Burhop, Eric Henry Stoneley (1911–1980) | accessdate= 24 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to Ballarat in 1923, where he attended [[Ballarat High School]] for most of his secondary education, receiving his leaving (Year 11) certificate in 1926. He transferred to [[Melbourne High School]] for his final year.&lt;ref name="oral" /&gt;

Burhop won a scholarship, and entered the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1928.&lt;ref name="oral"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/amad/nla.oh-vn2140577?searchTerm=Burhop+dies |title=Eric H. S. Burhop interviewed by Hazel de Berg for the Hazel de Berg collection |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]] |accessdate=25 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially studied civil engineering, but switched to science after two years, and majored in physics. In 1929, he was awarded a bursary that provided financial assistance. He graduated in 1931 with a [[bachelor of science]] [[BSc]] degree with [[first class honours]] in physics. He then earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA), also with first class honours, in mathematics in 1932, and a [[master of science]] in physics in 1933.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

For a master's research problem, Professor [[Thomas Laby]] had Burhop investigate the probability [[K shell]] ionisation by electron impact by measuring the intensity of the resultant [[X-ray]]  emissions. This aroused an interest in the [[Auger effect]], a subject in which he would later become an authority. By contrast, his master's thesis on "The Band Spectra of Diatomic Molecules" had little influence on his later work.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Eric Henry Stoneley Burhop 31 January 1911 – 22 January 1980 |first1=Harrie |last1=Massey |authorlink=Harrie Massey |first2=D.

== Cavendish Laboratory ==
[[File:Sir Ernest Rutherfords laboratory, early 20th century. (9660575343).jpg|thumb|right|Sir Ernest Rutherford's laboratory]]
The thesis was good enough, though, for Burhop to be awarded an [[1851 Exhibition Scholarship]] to study at [[Cambridge University]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]] under [[Lord Rutherford]] in 1933. The scholarship included a first-class ticket to London on the liner [[SS Oronsay (1924)|RMS ''Oronsay'']].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; At this time the Cavendish Laboratory was one of the leading centres of physics in the world. In 1932, Cavendish laboratory scientists [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]] split the [[atomic nucleus]], [[James Chadwick]] discovered the [[neutron]], and [[Patrick Blackett]] and [[Giuseppe Occhialini]] confirmed the existence of the [[positron]].&lt;ref name="oral" /&gt; Burhop was supervised by a fellow Australian, [[Mark Oliphant]].&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; He was initially assigned a task of investigating the diffusion of positive alkali metal ions on hot metal surfaces, but soon switch to a more interesting subject, the measurement of the [[excitation function]] for the pairs of [[deuteron]]s producing a [[Triton (physics)|triton]] through [[nuclear fusion]]:
::{{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium|2}} + {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium|2}} → {{nuclide|link=yes|tritium|3}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|proton}}
Burhop was able to observe the reaction at energies of less than 8 k[[electronvolt|eV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work on the Auger effect would culminate in a monograph, ''The Auger Effect and Other Radiationless Transitions'' (1952).&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Before coming to Cambridge, Burhop had not engaged in political activities. At Cambridge he encountered political debate generated by the suffering caused by the [[Great Depression]] and the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. While he rejected his parents' faith in favour of rationalist science, he did not reject their values, especially that of compassion for others, and there was no estrangement between them. At Cambridge he embraced [[socialism]], and believed that scientists had a moral responsibility to society, one that included fighting fascism.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

== University of Melbourne ==
Burhop returned to Australia in 1936, taking up a position as a [[lecturer]] at the University of Melbourne, where Laby was eager to build up the Physics Department by adding expertise in the latest developments in [[nuclear physics]]. He married his fiancée, Winifred Ida Stevens, on 23 December 1936 in a Salvation Army ceremony. They had a daughter and two sons. He completed his Cambridge [[doctor of philosophy]] (PhD) degree under Laby's supervision in 1938.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; It was in three parts: "The ionization and reorganization of an atom in an inner shell, with special reference to the Dirac theory of the electron"; "Some problems in atomic disintegration"; and "Note on the migration of atoms on a surface".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ulmss-newton.lib.cam.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=39990 |title=The ionization and reorganization of an atom in an inner shell, with special reference to the Dirac theory of the electron ; Eric Henry Stoneley Burhop |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |accessdate=26 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burhop established the first research program in the field in an Australian university, employing scientific equipment that he brought back from Britain. The centrepiece of the research effort was a 300 keV accelerator that produced a homogeneous neutron beam, which he commissioned in August 1939. He gave lectures on modern physics to the undergraduates, and on [[quantum mechanics]] to the postgraduates.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oral" /&gt;

After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the Physics Department worked on the development of optical munitions, particularly aluminised mirrors for [[aerial photography]]. In February 1942, Oliphant persuaded Laby to release Burhop and [[Leslie H. Martin|Leslie Martin]] to work on [[microwave radar]] at the Radiophysics Laboratory in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; Burhop and Martin produced a laboratory model of a [[cavity magnetron]] on 23 July 1942. Their magnetron was based on an overseas design, but made entirely from local components so that it could be manufactured in Australia.&lt;ref name="Mellor"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/histories/second_world_war/AWMOHWW2/Civil/Vol5/ |accessdate=25 February 2015 |series=[[Australia in the War of 1939–1945]] Series 4 – Civil |title=Volume V – The Role of Science and Industry |year=1958 |last=Mellor |first=David Paver |pp=446–450 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1942 he returned to the University of Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, an outpost of the Radiophysics Laboratory, where his task was turning his cavity magnetrons and [[reflex klystron]]s from prototypes into production models.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; Eventually, over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia.&lt;ref name="Mellor" /&gt;

== Manhattan Project ==
In January 1944, Oliphant had Sir [[David Rivett]], the head of the [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]], release Burhop to work on the [[Manhattan Project]],&lt;ref name="Binnie"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://royalsoc.org.au/publications/journal_2000_on/139_p1,2_binnie.pdf |journal=Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales |volume=139 |issue=419–420 |pp=11–22 |year=2006 |issn=0035-9173 |first=Anna |last=Binnie |title=Oliphant, the Father of Atomic Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/publications/historical-documents/Pages/volume-07/4-rivett-to-white.aspx |title=Rivett to White |date=5 January 1944 |publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] |accessdate=23 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Allied effort to create [[atomic bomb]]s. In May 1944, Burhop joined Oliphant's [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|British Mission]] at the [[Ernest Lawrence]]'s [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He was one of three Australian physicists working on the Manhattan Project, all at Berkeley, the others being Oliphant and Massey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/exhib/journal/as_fallout.htm |title=Australian Scientists and the Atomic Bomb |first=Tim |last=Sherratt |journal=Australasian Science |volume=17 |issue=3 |date=Spring 1996 |p=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Australians Help in Research"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article972407 |title=Australians Help in Research  |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |date=8 August 1945 |accessdate=25 February 2015 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Radiation Laboratory's task was to develop an electromagnetic [[isotope separation]] process. Burhop worked with [[David Bohm]] in Massey's Theoretical Group, studying the characteristics of electric discharges in magnetic fields, today known as [[Bohm diffusion]]. They also studied the ionisation of uranium compounds used as feed in the electromagnetic [[uranium enrichment]] process such as [[uranium tetrachloride]] (UCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[uranium hexafluoride]] (UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wartime papers produced by Bohm, Burhop and Massey were collected and published in {{cite book |editor-last=Guthrie |editor-first=Andrew |editor-first2=R. K. |editor-last2=Wakerling |year=1949 |title=The Characteristics of Electrical Discharges in Magnetic Fields |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |oclc=552825 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burhop's work involved the occasional visit to the Manhattan Project's  [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12]] electromagnetic faculty at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

== University College, London ==
[[File:Fermilab.jpg|thumb|right| Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Main Ring and Main Injector as seen from the air. The circular ponds dissipate waste heat from the equipment.]]
In early 1945, Massey offered Burhop a position as a lecturer at [[University College, London]], in the Mathematics Department, of which Massey was the departmental head. He had to wait until he was released by the University of Melbourne, and did not reach London until after the war ended in August 1945. His wife and family, who had stayed in Australia while he was working in the United States,  joined him in London some months later.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Australians Help in Research" /&gt; Living and working conditions in London were much worse than in California or Australia. Wartime shortages persisted, and the college had suffered bombing damage, so the Mathematics Department were located in temporary quarters. He was promoted to [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in 1949. Massey became head of the Physics Department in 1950, and Burhop moved there too. He became a professor in 1960, and Dean of the Faculty of Science in 1967.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Burhop listed "furtherance of international scientific cooperation" as one of his hobbies.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He worked with the [[University of Edinburgh]] and the [[University of Padua]] to establish a high-altitude [[cloud chamber]] on [[Marmolada]] that commenced operation in 1953. In 1957, he collaborated with Occhialini and [[C. F. Powell]] on a five-nation study of [[K meson]]s and their interaction with atomic nuclei that went on for several years, and produced a wealth of new results, including the first observation of a double lambda [[hypernucleus]]. He spent the 1962–63 academic year on secondment to [[CERN]], and was secretary of a committee chaired by [[Edoardo Amaldi]] that drew up its policy for accelerator development. The machines the committee recommended, the [[Intersecting Storage Rings]] and the [[Super Proton Synchrotron]] (SPS) were built, and became an important part of physics research in Europe for decades to come.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

When Burhop took charge of the Bubble Chamber Group at University College in 1967, he was quick to grasp the advantages of heavy liquid bubble chambers for studying neutrino interactions, and steered the group towards participation in joint European ventures, using the [[Gargamelle]]. The group's discovery of [[neutral current]]s in 1973 was a milestone on the road to the theoretical unification of [[electromagnetism]] with the [[weak force]].  In 1974 and 1975, with the help of [[Robert R. Wilson]], the director of the [[Fermilab]] in the United States, an international team from Fermilab and seven European laboratories under Burhop's leadership carried out a search for a new particle, the existence of which Burhop had predicted in 1963. He had suggested that [[neutrino]] interactions could create short-lived (perhaps as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt; s) particles that could be detected with the use of [[nuclear emulsion]]. Experiment E247 at Fermilab successfully detected particles with a lifetime of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; s. A follow-up experiment WA17 with the SPS confirmed the existence of the {{SubatomicParticle|Charmed Lambda+}} (charmed [[lambda baryon]]), with a flight time of 7.3±0.1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

== Social activism ==
The [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO) opened a file on Burhop in 1948,&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; believing him to be a secret member of the [[Communist Party of Australia]], and an associate of [[Ian Milner]], who was known through [[Venona]] intercepts to have passed secret documents to the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Spy Catchers.

Like many scientists who had worked on the Manhattan Project, Burhop was concerned about the dangers of nuclear weapons, and addressed over 500 public meetings to raise awareness of the subject. He had been a founding member of the Australian Association of Scientific Workers in 1939, and after the war became chairman of the Atomic Science Committee of the Association of Scientific Workers, and a member of its Science Policy Committee, in Britain. In this capacity he helped organise the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He founded the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science in 1969.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; He was president of his local branch of the [[Association of University Teachers]] from 1970 to 1972,&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; and of the [[World Federation of Scientific Workers]] from 1971 to 1980.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

Over the years Burhop received a number of honours and awards. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1963,&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; and delivered its [[Rutherford Memorial Lecture]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rutherford Memorial Lecture, 1979.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2756">'''Extended aeration''' is a method of sewage treatment using modified [[activated sludge]] procedures.  It is preferred for relatively small waste loads, where lower operating efficiency is offset by mechanical simplicity.

==Conventional sewage treatment==
Mechanized [[sewage treatment]] typically includes settling in a primary [[clarifier]], followed by biological treatment and a secondary clarifier.  Both clarifiers produce waste [[sludge]] requiring [[sewage sludge treatment]] and disposal.  Activated sludge agitates a portion of the secondary clarifier sludge in the primary clarifier effluent.  Remaining secondary sludge and all primary sludge typically require digestion prior to disposal.

==Process modification==
Extended aeration agitates all incoming waste in the sludge from a single clarifier.  The combined sludge starts with a higher concentration of inert solids than typical secondary sludge and the longer mixing time required for digestion of primary solids in addition to dissolved organics produces aged sludge requiring greater mixing energy input per unit of waste oxidized.

==Applications==
Extended aeration is typically used in prefabricated "package plants" intended to minimize design costs for waste disposal from small communities, tourist facilities, or schools.  In comparison to traditional activated sludge, longer mixing time with aged sludge offers a stable biological ecosystem better adapted for effectively treating waste load fluctuations from variable occupancy situations. Supplemental feeding with something like sugar is sometimes used to sustain sludge microbial populations during periods of low occupancy; but population response to variable food characteristics is unpredictable, and supplemental feeding increases waste sludge volumes. Sludge may be periodically removed by septic tank pumping trucks as sludge volume approaches storage capacity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3899">'''Financial cryptography''' is the use of [[cryptography]] in applications in which financial loss could result from subversion of the message system. Financial cryptography is distinguished from traditional cryptography in that for most of recorded history, cryptography has been used almost entirely for military and diplomatic purposes. 

Financial cryptography includes the mechanisms and algorithms necessary for the protection of financial transfers, in addition to the creation of new forms of money. [[Proof of work]] and various [[auction]] protocols fall under the umbrella of Financial cryptography. [[Hashcash]] is being used to limit spam.

Financial cryptography has been seen to have a very broad scope of application. Ian Grigg sees financial cryptography in seven layers, being the combination of seven distinct disciplines: cryptography, [[software engineering]], rights, [[accounting]], [[governance]], [[Value (economics)|value]], and financial applications. Business failures can often be traced to the absence of one or more of these disciplines, or to poor application of them.  This views Financial cryptography as an appropriately cross-discipline subject. Indeed, inevitably so, given that [[finance]] and [[cryptography]] are each built upon multiple disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iang.org/papers/fc7.html Financial Cryptography in 7 Layers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Cryptographers think the field originated from the work of Dr [[David Chaum]] who invented the [[blind signature]]. The blind signature is a special form of a [[digital signature|cryptographic signature]] which allowed virtual coins to be signed without the signer seeing the actual coin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sceweb.sce.uhcl.edu/yang/teaching/csci5234WebSecurityFall2011/Chaum-blind-signatures.PDF|title=Blind Signatures for Untraceable Payments|last=Chaum|first=David|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It permitted a form of digital [[token money]] that prevented traceability. This form is sometimes known as [[Digital currency]]. 

A system that was widely used during the 1970s-1990s and previously developed cryptographic mechanism is the [[Data Encryption Standard]], which was used primarily for the protection of electronic funds transfers. However, it was the work of [[David Chaum]] that excited the cryptography community about the potential of encrypted messages as actual [[financial instrument]]s. 

As part of a business model, Financial cryptography followed the guide of cryptography and only the simplest ideas were adopted.  Account money systems protected by [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] such as [[PayPal]] and [[e-gold]] were relatively successful, but more innovative mechanisms, including blinded token money, were not. 

==Associations==
Financial cryptography is to some extent organized around the annual meeting of the ''International Financial Cryptography Association'', which is held each year in a different location.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifca.ai/ Financial Cryptography&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Back-Scattered Electron Micrograph of Coal Fly Ash small.tif|thumb|250px|Photomicrograph made with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and back-scatter detector: cross section of fly ash particles at 750x magnification]]

'''Fly ash''' or '''flue ash''', also known as '''pulverised fuel ash''' in the United Kingdom, is a [[coal combustion product]] that is composed of the [[particulates]] (fine particles of burned fuel) that are driven out of coal-fired [[boiler]]s together with the [[flue gas]]es. Ash that falls to the bottom of the boiler is called [[bottom ash]]. In modern [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired power plants]], fly ash is generally captured by [[electrostatic precipitator]]s or other particle filtration equipment before the flue gases reach the chimneys. Together with [[bottom ash]] removed from the bottom of the boiler, it is known as '''coal ash'''. Depending upon the source and composition of the coal being burned, the components of fly ash vary considerably, but all fly ash includes substantial amounts of [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (both [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] and [[Crystallinity|crystalline]]), [[aluminium oxide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[calcium oxide]] (CaO), the main mineral compounds in  coal-bearing [[Stratum|rock strata]].

The minor constituents of fly ash depend upon the specific [[coal bed|coal bed composition]] but may include one or more of the following elements or compounds found in trace concentrations (up to hundreds ppm): [[arsenic]], [[beryllium]], [[boron]], [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], [[hexavalent chromium]], [[cobalt]], [[lead]], [[manganese]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]], [[strontium]], [[thallium]], and [[vanadium]], along with very small concentrations of [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]] and [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH compounds]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Managing Coal Combustion Residues in Mines, Committee on Mine Placement of Coal Combustion Wastes, National Research Council of the National Academies, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human and Ecological Risk Assessment of Coal Combustion Wastes, RTI, [[Research Triangle Park]], August 6, 2007, prepared for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt; It also has unburnt carbon.&lt;ref&gt;Sonia Helle, Alfredo Gordon, Guillermo Alfaro Ximena Garcı́a, Claudia Ulloa. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037838200200245X Coal blend combustion: link between unburnt carbon in fly ashes and maceral composition]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, fly ash was generally released into the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], but air pollution control standards now require that it be captured prior to release by fitting [[Air pollution#Control devices|pollution control equipment]]. In the United States, fly ash is generally stored at coal power plants or placed in landfills. About 43% is recycled,&lt;ref&gt;American Coal Ash Association http://www.acaa-usa.org&lt;/ref&gt; often used as a [[pozzolan]] to produce [[hydraulic cement]] or [[hydraulic plaster]] and a replacement or partial replacement for [[Portland cement]] in concrete production. Pozzolans ensure the setting of concrete and plaster and provide concrete with more protection from wet conditions and chemical attack.

In the case that fly (or bottom) ash is not produced from coal, for example when solid waste is incinerated in a [[waste-to-energy]] facility to produce electricity, the ash may contain higher levels of contaminants than coal ash. In that case the ash produced is often classified as hazardous waste.

Fly ash material solidifies while suspended in the exhaust gases and is collected by [[electrostatic precipitator]]s or filter bags. Since the particles solidify rapidly while suspended in the exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally [[sphere|spherical]] in shape and range in size from 0.5 [[µm]] to 300&amp;nbsp;µm. The major consequence of the rapid cooling is that few minerals have time to crystallize, and that mainly amorphous, quenched glass remains. Nevertheless, some [[refractory]] phases in the pulverized coal do not melt (entirely), and remain crystalline. In consequence, fly ash is a heterogeneous material. SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and occasionally CaO are the main chemical components present in fly ashes. The mineralogy of fly ashes is very diverse. The main phases encountered are a glass phase, together with [[quartz]], [[mullite]] and the iron oxides [[hematite]], [[magnetite]] and/or [[maghemite]]. Other phases often identified are [[cristobalite]], [[anhydrite]], [[calcium oxide|free lime]], [[periclase]], [[calcite]], [[sylvite]], [[halite]], [[calcium hydroxide|portlandite]], [[rutile]] and [[anatase]]. The Ca-bearing minerals [[anorthite]], [[gehlenite]], [[akermanite]] and various calcium silicates and calcium aluminates identical to those found in [[Portland cement]] can be identified in Ca-rich fly ashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snellings|first=R.|author2=Mertens G. |author3=Elsen J. |title=Supplementary cementitious materials|journal=Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry|year=2012|volume=74|pages=211–278|doi=10.2138/rmg.2012.74.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] content can reach {{nowrap|1 [[Parts-per notation|ppm]]}}&lt;!--page20--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fly Ash in Concrete |url=http://transparency.perkinswill.com/assets/Whitepapers/FlyAsh_WhitePaper.pdf |date=2011-11-17 |accessdate=2013-11-19 |publisher=perkinswill.com|quote=Fly ash contains approximately one part per million of mercury.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is generally included in the range 0.01 - 1 ppm for bituminous coal.
The concentrations of other trace elements vary as well according to the kind of coal combusted to form it. In fact, in the case of bituminous coal, with the notable exception of boron, trace element concentrations are generally similar to trace element concentrations in unpolluted soils.&lt;ref&gt;EPRI (Project Manager K. Ladwig) 2010, Comparison of coal combustion products to other common materials - Chemical Characteristics, Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA&lt;/ref&gt;

Two classes of fly ash are defined by [[ASTM International|ASTM]] C618: Class F fly ash and Class C fly ash. The chief difference between these classes is the amount of calcium, silica, alumina, and iron content in the ash. The chemical properties of the fly ash are largely influenced by the chemical content of the coal burned (i.e., [[anthracite]], [[bituminous coal|bituminous]], and [[lignite]]).&lt;ref name="ASTM Pozzolan" &gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/DATABASE.CART/REDLINE_PAGES/C618.htm?L+mystore+lsft6707
  |title=ASTM C618 - 08 Standard Specification for Coal Fly Ash and Raw or Calcined Natural Pozzolan for Use in Concrete
  |accessdate=2008-09-18
  |publisher=ASTM International
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all fly ashes meet ASTM C618 requirements, although depending on the application, this may not be necessary. Fly ash used as a cement replacement must meet strict construction standards, but no standard environmental regulations have been established in the United States. Seventy-five percent of the fly ash must have a [[fineness]] of 45&amp;nbsp;µm or less, and have a [[carbon]] content, measured by the loss on ignition (LOI), of less than 4%. In the US, LOI must be under 6%. The particle size distribution of raw fly ash tends to fluctuate constantly, due to changing performance of the coal mills and the boiler performance. This makes it necessary that, if fly ash is used in an optimal way to replace cement in concrete production, it must be processed using beneficiation methods like mechanical air classification. But if fly ash is used as a filler to replace sand in concrete production, unbeneficiated fly ash with higher LOI can be also used. Especially important is the ongoing quality verification. This is mainly expressed by quality control seals like the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]] mark or the DCL mark of the Dubai Municipality.

===Class F===
The burning of harder, older anthracite and bituminous coal typically produces Class F fly ash. This fly ash is [[pozzolan]]ic in nature, and contains less than 7% [[lime (mineral)|lime]] (CaO). Possessing [[ pozzolanic ]] properties, the glassy silica and alumina of Class F fly ash requires a cementing agent, such as Portland cement, quicklime, or hydrated lime—mixed with water to react and produce cementitious compounds. Alternatively, adding a chemical activator such as [[sodium silicate]] (water glass) to a Class F ash can form a [[geopolymer]].

===Class C===
Fly ash produced from the burning of younger lignite or sub-bituminous coal, in addition to having pozzolanic properties, also has some self-cementing properties. In the presence of water, Class C fly ash hardens and gets stronger over time. Class C fly ash generally contains more than 20% lime (CaO). Unlike Class F, self-cementing Class C fly ash does not require an activator. Alkali and [[sulfate]] ({{chem|SO|4}}) contents are generally higher in Class C fly ashes.

At least one US manufacturer has announced a [[fly ash brick]] containing up to 50% Class C fly ash. Testing shows the bricks meet or exceed the performance standards listed in [[ASTM]] C 216 for conventional clay brick. It is also within the allowable shrinkage limits for concrete brick in ASTM C 55, Standard Specification for Concrete Building Brick. It is estimated that the production method used in fly ash bricks will reduce the embodied energy of masonry construction by up to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://calstarproducts.com/%E2%80%9Cthe-building-brick-of-sustainability%E2%80%9D-construction-specifications-institute-magazine/ The Building Brick of Sustainability] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628103011/http://calstarproducts.com/%E2%80%9Cthe-building-brick-of-sustainability%E2%80%9D-construction-specifications-institute-magazine/ |date=2009-06-28 }}".

==Disposal and market sources==
In the past, fly ash produced from coal combustion was simply entrained in [[flue gas]]es and dispersed into the atmosphere. This created environmental and health concerns that prompted laws that have reduced fly ash emissions to less than 1% of ash produced. Worldwide, more than 65% of fly ash produced from coal power stations is disposed of in [[landfill]]s and [[ash pond]]s, although companies such as Duke Energy are starting initiatives to excavate [[coal ash basin]]s due to the negative environmental impact involved.

The recycling of fly ash has become an increasing concern in recent years due to increasing landfill costs and current interest in [[sustainable development]]. {{As of|2005}}, coal-fired power plants in the US reported producing 71.1 million tons of fly ash, of which 29.1 million tons were reused in various applications.&lt;ref name="acaa2005"&gt;{{cite web | author=American Coal Ash Association | title=CCP Production and Use Survey | url=http://www.acaa-usa.org/PDF/2005_CCP_Production_and_Use_Figures_Released_by_ACAA.pdf | format=PDF | access-date=2007-07-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911223032/http://www.acaa-usa.org/PDF/2005_CCP_Production_and_Use_Figures_Released_by_ACAA.pdf | archive-date=2007-09-11 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the nearly 42 million tons of unused fly ash had been recycled, it would have reduced the need for approximately {{convert|27500|acre.ft|m3|abbr=on}} of landfill space.&lt;ref name="acaa2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="epaCCP" &gt;{{cite web | author = US Environmental Protection Agency | authorlink = United States Environmental Protection Agency |title=Using Coal Ash in Highway Construction - A Guide to Benefits and Impacts | url=http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/osw/conserve/c2p2/pubs/greenbk508.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other environmental benefits to recycling fly ash includes reducing the demand for virgin materials that would need [[quarry]]ing and cheap substitution for materials such as [[Portland cement]].

As of 2006, about 125 million tons of coal-combustion byproducts, including fly ash, were produced in the US each year, with about 43% of that amount used in commercial applications, according to the American Coal Ash Association Web site. As of early 2008, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) hoped that figure would increase to 50% as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://hamptonroads.com/2008/03/above-ground-golf-course-just-beneath-it-potential-health-risks |title=Above ground, a golf course.

==Reuse==
There is no US governmental registration or labelling of fly ash utilization in the different sectors of the economy - industry, infrastructures and agriculture. Fly ash utilization survey data, acknowledged as incomplete, are published annually by the American Coal Ash Association.&lt;ref name="ACAA, Coal Combustion Products Production &amp; Use Statistics"&gt;{{cite web

===Portland cement===
Owing to its [[pozzolan]]ic properties, fly ash is used as a replacement for [[Portland cement]] in [[concrete]].&lt;ref name="Scott, 2007, Evolution" &gt;{{cite journal

  |date=January–February 2007 | doi=10.14359/18496
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of fly ash as a pozzolanic ingredient was recognized as early as 1914, although the earliest noteworthy study of its use was in 1937.&lt;ref name="NCHRP, 1986" &gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Halstead | first = W. | title = Use of Fly Ash in Concrete
  | journal = National Cooperative Highway Research Project | volume = 127
  |date=October 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman structures such as [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] or the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome used volcanic ash or [[pozzolana]] (which possesses similar properties to fly ash) as [[pozzolan]] in their concrete.&lt;ref name="Moore, Pantheon" &gt;{{cite book
  | last =Moore  | first =David
  |title =The Roman [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]: The Triumph of Concrete
}}&lt;/ref&gt; As pozzolan greatly improves the strength and durability of concrete, the use of ash is a key factor in their preservation.

Use of fly ash as a partial replacement for Portland cement is particularly suitable but not limited to Class C fly ashes.  Class "F" fly ashes can have volatile effects on the entrained air content of concrete, causing reduced resistance to freeze/thaw damage. Fly ash often replaces up to 30% by mass of Portland cement, but can be used in higher dosages in certain applications. In some cases, fly ash can add to the concrete's final strength and increase its chemical resistance and durability.

Fly ash can significantly improve the workability of concrete. Recently, techniques have been developed to replace partial cement with high-volume fly ash (50% cement replacement). For roller-compacted concrete (RCC)[used in dam construction], replacement values of 70% have been achieved with processed fly ash at the Ghatghar dam project in Maharashtra, India. Due to the spherical shape of fly ash particles, it can increase workability of cement while reducing water demand.&lt;ref name="faffhe" &gt;{{cite web
  | author = US Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration
  | title = Fly Ash Facts for Highway Engineers
  | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/recycling/fafacts.pdf
  |format=PDF
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of fly ash claim that replacing Portland cement with fly ash reduces the [[greenhouse gas]] "footprint" of concrete, as the production of one ton of Portland cement generates approximately one ton of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], compared to no CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generated with fly ash. New fly ash production, i.e., the burning of coal, produces approximately 20 to 30 tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per ton of fly ash. Since the worldwide production of Portland cement is expected to reach nearly 2 billion tons by 2010, replacement of any large portion of this cement by fly ash could significantly reduce carbon emissions associated with construction, as long as the comparison takes the production of fly ash as a given.

===Embankment===
Fly ash properties are unusual among engineering materials. Unlike soils typically used for embankment construction, fly ash has a large uniformity coefficient and it consists of [[clay#Definition|clay-sized]] particles. Engineering properties that affect the use of fly ash in embankments include grain size distribution, [[proctor compaction test|compaction characteristics]], [[shear strength]], [[compressibility]], [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]], and [[frost heaving|frost susceptibility]].&lt;ref name="faffhe" /&gt; Nearly all the types of fly ash used in embankments are Class F.

===Soil stabilization===
Soil stabilization is the permanent physical and chemical alteration of soils to enhance their physical properties. Stabilization can increase the shear strength of a soil and/or control the shrink-swell properties of a soil, thus improving the load-bearing capacity of a sub-grade to support pavements and foundations. Stabilization can be used to treat a wide range of sub-grade materials from expansive clays to granular materials. Stabilization can be achieved with a variety of chemical additives including lime, fly ash, and Portland cement. Proper design and testing is an important component of any stabilization project. This allows for the establishment of design criteria, and determination of the proper chemical additive and admixture rate that achieves the desired engineering properties. Stabilization process benefits can include: Higher resistance (R) values, Reduction in plasticity, Lower permeability, Reduction of pavement thickness, Elimination of excavation - material hauling/handling - and base importation, Aids compaction, Provides "all-weather" access onto and within projects sites. Another form of soil treatment closely related to soil stabilization is soil modification, sometimes referred to as "mud drying" or soil conditioning. Although some stabilization inherently occurs in soil modification, the distinction is that soil modification is merely a means to reduce the moisture content of a soil to expedite construction, whereas stabilization can substantially increase the shear strength of a material such that it can be incorporated into the project's structural design. The determining factors associated with soil modification vs soil stabilization may be the existing moisture content, the end use of the soil structure and ultimately the cost benefit provided. Equipment for the stabilization and modification processes include: chemical additive spreaders, soil mixers (reclaimers), portable pneumatic storage containers, water trucks, deep lift compactors, motor graders.

===Flowable fill===
Fly ash is also used as a component in the production of [[flowable fill]] (also called controlled low strength material, or CLSM), which is used as self-leveling, self-compact backfill material in lieu of compacted earth or granular fill. The strength of flowable fill mixes can range from 50 to 1,200 [[pound-force per square inch|lbf/in²]] (0.3 to 8.3 [[megapascal|MPa]]), depending on the design requirements of the project in question. Flowable fill includes mixtures of Portland cement and filler material, and can contain mineral admixtures. Fly ash can replace either the Portland cement or fine aggregate (in most cases, river sand) as a filler material. High fly ash content mixes contain nearly all fly ash, with a small percentage of Portland cement and enough water to make the mix flowable. Low fly ash content mixes contain a high percentage of filler material, and a low percentage of fly ash, Portland cement, and water. Class F fly ash is best suited for high fly ash content mixes, whereas Class C fly ash is almost always used in low fly ash content mixes.&lt;ref name="faffhe" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Asphalt concrete===
Asphalt concrete is a composite material consisting of an asphalt binder and mineral aggregate. Both Class F and Class C fly ash can typically be used as a mineral filler to fill the voids and provide contact points between larger aggregate particles in asphalt concrete mixes. This application is used in conjunction, or as a replacement for, other binders (such as Portland cement or hydrated lime). For use in asphalt pavement, the fly ash must meet mineral filler specifications outlined in [http://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/DATABASE.CART/REDLINE_PAGES/D242.htm?L+mystore+ndfm2845 ASTM D242]. The hydrophobic nature of fly ash gives pavements better resistance to stripping. Fly ash has also been shown to increase the stiffness of the asphalt matrix, improving rutting resistance and increasing mix durability.&lt;ref name="faffhe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimmer, 1970, Bituminous Filler" &gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geopolymers===
More recently, fly ash has been used as a component in [[geopolymers]], where the reactivity of the fly ash glasses can be used to create a binder similar to a hydrated [[Portland cement]] in appearance, but with potentially superior properties, including reduced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, depending on the formulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Duxson | first = P. | last2 = Provis | first2 = J.L. | last3 = Lukey | first3 = G.C. | last4 = van Deventer | first4 = J.S.J. | title = The role of inorganic polymer technology in the development of 'Green concrete' | journal = Cement and Concrete Research | volume = 37 | issue = 12 | year = 2007 | pages = 1590–1597 | doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2007.08.018 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roller compacted concrete===
[[File:UserKTrimble-AP Taum Sauk Reservoir UnderConstruction Nov 22 2009 crop1.jpg|thumb|right|The upper reservoir of [[Ameren]]'s [[Taum Sauk Hydroelectric Power Station|Taum Sauk hydroelectric plant]] was constructed of roller-compacted concrete that included fly ash from one of Ameren's coal plants.&lt;ref name="taumsauk"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Another application of using fly ash is in [[roller compacted concrete]] dams. Many dams in the US have been constructed with high fly ash contents. Fly ash lowers the heat of hydration allowing thicker placements to occur. Data for these can be found at the US Bureau of Reclamation. This has also been demonstrated in the [[Ghatghar Dam]] Project in [[India]].

=== Bricks ===
There are several techniques for manufacturing construction bricks from fly ash, producing a wide variety of products. One type of fly ash brick is manufactured by mixing fly ash with an equal amount of clay, then firing in a kiln at about {{nowrap|1000 °C.}}  This approach has the principal benefit of reducing the amount of clay required. Another type of fly ash brick is made by mixing soil, plaster of paris, fly ash and water, and allowing the mixture to dry. Because no heat is required, this technique reduces air pollution. More modern manufacturing processes use a greater proportion of fly ash, and a high pressure manufacturing technique, which produces high strength bricks with environmental benefits.

In the United Kingdom, fly ash has been used for over fifty years to make concrete building blocks. They are widely used for the inner skin of [[cavity wall]]s. They are naturally more thermally insulating than blocks made with other aggregates. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Ash bricks have been used in house construction in [[Windhoek|Windhoek, Namibia]] since the 1970s. There is, however, a problem with the bricks in that they tend to fail or produce unsightly pop-outs. This happens when the bricks come into contact with moisture and a chemical reaction occurs causing the bricks to expand. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In India, fly ash bricks are used for construction. Leading manufacturers use an industrial standard known as "Pulverized fuel ash for lime-Pozzolana mixture" using over 75% post-industrial recycled waste, and a compression process. This produces a strong product with good insulation properties and environmental benefits.&lt;ref name=fbd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyashbricksdelhi.com/faqs#A2 |title=FAQs - Fly Ash Bricks - Puzzolana Green Fly-Ash bricks |publisher=Fly Ash Bricks Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flyashbricksinfo.com/construction/list-of-important-is-codes-related-to-bricks.html |title=List of important IS Codes related to bricks |publisher=Fly Ash Bricks Info |access-date=2011-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004155707/http://flyashbricksinfo.com/construction/list-of-important-is-codes-related-to-bricks.html |archive-date=2011-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metal matrix composites===
Hollow fly ash can be infiltrated by molten metal to form solid, alumina encased spheres. Fly ash can also be mixed with molten metal and cast to reduce overall weight and density, due to the low density of fly ash. Research is underway to incorporate fly ash into lead acid batteries in a lead calcium tin fly ash composite in an effort to reduce weight of the battery.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Waste treatment and stabilization===
Fly ash, in      view of its alkalinity and water absorption capacity, may be used in combination with other alkaline materials to transform [[sewage sludge]] into organic fertilizer or [[biofuel]].&lt;ref name="N-Viro"&gt;[http://www.nviro.com/soil.html N-Viro International] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823025712/http://www.nviro.com/soil.html |date=August 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NMI3"&gt;{{cite web

  |url=http://nmi3.eu/news-and-media/scientific-highlights/from-ash-to-eco-friendly-solution-for-hazardous-metals-removal.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catalyst===
Fly ash, when treated with [[sodium hydroxide]], appears to function well as a [[catalyst]] for converting [[polyethylene]] into substance similar to [[crude oil]] in a high-temperature process called [[pyrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.environmental-expert.com/Files/0/articles/9566/Pyrolysisoflow-densitypolyethylene.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, fly ash, mainly class C, may be used in the stabilization/solidification process of hazardous wastes and contaminated soils.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, 2009. Technology performance review: selecting and using solidification/stabilization treatment for site remediation. NRMRL, US Environmental Protection Agency, Cincinnati, OH&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Rhenipal process uses fly ash as an admixture to stabilize [[sewage sludge]] and other toxic sludges. This process has been used since 1996 to stabilize large amounts of [[hexavalent chromium|chromium(VI)]] contaminated [[Tanning (leather)|leather sludges]] in [[Alcanena]], Portugal.&lt;ref name="DIRK, Alcanena"&gt;{{cite web

== Environmental problems ==

===Groundwater contamination===
Since coal contains trace levels of trace elements (like e.g. arsenic, barium, beryllium, boron, cadmium, chromium, thallium, selenium, molybdenum and mercury), fly ash obtained after combustion of this coal contains enhanced concentrations of these elements, and therefore the potential of the ash to cause groundwater pollution needs to be evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tatiana Schlossberg |title=2 Tennessee Cases Bring Coal’s Hidden Hazard to Light |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/15/climate/tennessee-coal-ash-disposal-lawsuits.html |date=April 15, 2017 |access-date=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the USA there are documented cases of groundwater pollution which followed ash disposal or utilization without the necessary protection means.&lt;ref&gt;A December 2008 Maryland court decision levied a $54 million penalty against [[Constellation Energy]], which had performed a "restoration project" of filling an abandoned gravel quarry with fly ash; the ash contaminated area waterwells with heavy metals.

===Ecology===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
When newly produced the dust is strongly [[alkaline]]; a [[pH]] as high as 11 is known, and &gt;9 is normal. It [[Leaching (chemical science)|leaches]] a solution dominated by [[sodium]] and [[sulfate]], with enough [[boron]] (&gt;15&amp;nbsp;mg l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) to kill most plants, though coastal species often tolerate the salinity and boron to grow on young ash lagoons.  In dry conditions these solutes rise to the surface to form a hard salt crust, impeding all plant growth, though hardy grass species such as ''[[Vulpia myuros]]'' can later colonise it. A "waxy" layer has been known to form in some locations which inhibits root penetration, however, mixing crushed rock into the top layer has been found to inhibit the formation of the "waxy" layer.

As the ash weathers, its salinity, boron level and pH all fall; the former two are largely removed from surface layers after 5 years outdoors, while pH declines towards 7 in a generally linear fashion at a rate of about 1 pH unit per 20 years. The floral succession approximates to that of a coastal dune system, without the wind-blown deposition, so salt-tolerant plants are replaced by an attractive sward of [[legume]]s and [[Perennial plant|perennials]] before turning to [[birch]]/[[willow]] scrub woodland.  A notable feature are the ''[[Dactylorhiza]]'' orchids which often form spectacular colonies 10–20 years post dumping, only to fade away again as the woodland thickens.  [[Hydroseeding]] is often used to establish vegetation onto PFA due to the inhospitable conditions of most sites.

=== Spills of bulk storage ===
[[File:Aerial view of ash slide site Dec 23 2008 TVA.gov 123002.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Tennessee Valley Authority]] [[Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill|Fly Ash containment failure on 23 December 2008]] in [[Kingston, Tennessee]]]]

Where fly ash is stored in bulk, it is usually stored wet rather than dry to minimize [[fugitive dust]]. The resulting impoundments (ponds) are typically large and stable for long periods, but any breach of their dams or [[bunding]] is rapid and on a massive scale.

In December 2008, the collapse of an embankment at an impoundment for wet storage of fly ash at the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Kingston Fossil Plant]] caused a [[Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill|major release]] of 5.4 million cubic yards of coal fly ash, damaging 3 homes and flowing into the Emory River. Cleanup costs may exceed $1.2 billion. This spill was followed a few weeks later by a smaller TVA-plant spill in [[Alabama]], which contaminated Widows Creek and the Tennessee River.

In 2014, 39,000 tons of ash and 27 million gallons (100,000 cubic meters) of contaminated water [[2014 Dan River coal ash spill|spilled into the Dan River]] near [[Eden, NC]] from a closed North Carolina coal-fired power plant that is owned by [[Duke Energy]].

=== Contaminants ===
Fly ash contains trace concentrations of [[heavy metals]] and other substances that are known to be detrimental to health in sufficient quantities. Potentially toxic trace elements in coal include [[arsenic]], [[beryllium]], [[cadmium]], [[barium]], [[chromium]], [[copper]], [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[molybdenum]], [[nickel]], [[radium]], [[selenium]], [[thorium]], [[uranium]], [[vanadium]], and [[zinc]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, T.R., Young, S.D., Crittenden, P.D., Zhang, H.

==Exposure concerns==
[[silica|Crystalline silica]] and [[lime (mineral)|lime]] along with toxic chemicals represent exposure risks to human health and the environment. Fly ash contains crystalline silica which is known to cause lung disease, in particular [[silicosis]], if inhaled. Crystalline silica is listed by the [[IARC Group 1 carcinogen|IARC]] and US National Toxicology Program as a known human [[carcinogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/content/listed_substances_508.pdf|title=Substances Listed in the Thirteenth Report on Carcinogens|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NTP|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lime (CaO) reacts with water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to form [[calcium hydroxide]] [Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], giving fly ash a pH somewhere between 10 and 12, a medium to strong base. This can also cause lung damage if present in sufficient quantities.

Material Safety Data Sheets recommend a number of safety precautions be taken when handling or working with fly ash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flyash.com/data/upfiles/resource/002%20Class%20F%20Fly%20Ash%20051815.pdf|title=Headwaters Resources Class F Fly Ash Safety Data Sheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Headwaters Resources|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include wearing protective goggles, respirators and disposable clothing and avoiding agitating the fly ash in order to minimize the amount which becomes airborne.

The National Academy of Sciences noted in 2007 that "the presence of high contaminant levels in many CCR (coal combustion residue) [[leachates]] may create human health and ecological concerns".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

== Compliance ==
=== United States ===
After a long regulatory process, the EPA published a final ruling in December 2014, which establishes that coal fly ash is regulated on the federal level as "non-hazardous" waste according to the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA). Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR's) are listed in the subtitle D (rather than under subtitle C dealing with hazardous waste, which was also considered).&lt;ref&gt;EPA 2014, Final rule: disposal of coal combustion residuals from electric utilities, Environmental Protection Agency, Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, as coal power producers complied with federal Obama-era groundwater monitoring rules at coal ash disposal sites, the Trump Administration announced plans to let states regulate the facilities similar to how they regulate municipal trash landfills. The United States EPA announced a series of proposals it said would save the utility industry up to $100 million annually in compliance costs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/11084-utilities-seek-regulatory-certainty-management-coal-ash/|title=Utilities seek regulatory certainty in management of coal ash|last=Yingling|first=Bill|date=2018-03-06|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-03-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Today’s coal ash proposal embodies EPA’s commitment to our state partners by providing them with the ability to incorporate flexibilities into their coal ash permit programs based on the needs of their states,” said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt in a written statement on March 1.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to ''Daily Energy Insider'', "The rules would apply to ash sites at more than 400 coal-fired power plants across the nation. The proposed rules involve the material that remains after power plants burn coal to create steam and drive turbine electric generators. The ash is called coal combustion residual, or CCR, in regulatory parlance."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Global Innovation Index''' ('''GII''') is an annual ranking of countries by their capacity for, and success in, [[innovation]]. It is published by [[Cornell University]], [[INSEAD]], and the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], in partnership with other organisations and institutions,{{r|matt|page=333}} and is based on both subjective and objective data derived from several sources, including the [[International Telecommunication Union]], the [[World Bank]] and the [[World Economic Forum]].{{r|jean|page=203}} The index was started in 2007 by INSEAD and ''[[World Business (magazine)|World Business]]'',{{r|jean|page=203}} a British magazine. The GII is commonly used by corporate and government officials to compare countries by their level of innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-ranked-as-world-leader-in-innovation | title=UK ranked as world-leader in innovation | publisher=Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills | date=17 September 2015 | accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GII is computed by taking a simple average of the scores in two sub-indices, the Innovation Input Index and Innovation Output Index, which are composed of five and two pillars respectively. Each of these pillars describe an attribute of innovation, and comprise up to five indicators, and their score is calculated by the weighted average method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/userfiles/file/reportpdf/gii-full-report-2015-v6.pdf|title=Global Innovation Index Report 2015|last=Cornell University, INSEAD and WIPO|first=|date=2015|website=www.globalinnovationindex.org/|publisher=Fontainebleau, Ithaca, and Geneva|access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grader in Jyväskylä.jpg|thumb|Modern grader with a second blade in  [[Jyväskylä]], Finland]]
[[File:Grader02.jpg|thumb|Modern grader, in foreground]]

A '''grader''', also commonly referred to as a '''road grader''' or a '''motor grader''', is a [[heavy equipment (construction)|construction machine]] with a long blade used to create a flat surface during the [[Grading (engineering)|grading]] process. Although the earliest models were towed behind horses or other powered equipment, most modern graders contain an [[engine]] so are known as "motor graders". Typical models have three [[axle]]s, with the [[engine]] and [[Cabin (truck)|cab]] situated above the rear axles at one end of the vehicle and a third axle at the front end of the vehicle, with the [[blade]] in between.  Most motor graders drive the rear axles in [[tandem]], but some also add front wheel drive to improve grading capability.  Many graders also have optional attachments for the rear of the machine which can be ripper, scarifier, blade, or compactor.  In certain countries, for example in [[Finland]], almost every grader is equipped with a second blade that is placed in front of the front axle. For snowplowing and some dirt grading operations, a side blade can also be mounted.  Some construction personnel refer to the entire machine as "the blade". Capacities range from a blade width of 2.50 to 7.30 m (8 to 24 ft) and engines from 93–373 [[kW]] (125–500 [[horsepower|hp]]). Certain graders can operate multiple attachments, or be designed for specialized tasks like underground mining.  

In [[civil engineering]], the grader's purpose is to "finish grade" (to refine or set precisely). The angle, tilt (or pitch) and height of the grader's blade can be adjusted to achieve precision grading of a surface.  The "rough grading" is performed by heavy equipment or engineering vehicles such as [[wheel tractor-scraper|scrapers]] and [[bulldozer]]s.

Graders are commonly used in the construction and maintenance of [[dirt road]]s and [[gravel road]]s. In the construction of paved [[road construction|roads]] they are used to prepare the [[base course]] to create a wide flat surface upon which to place the [[road surface]]. Graders are also used to set native [[soil]] or [[gravel]] [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] pads to finish grade prior to the construction of large buildings. Graders can produce inclined surfaces, to give [[Cant (road/rail)|cant]] (camber or sideslope) to roads. In some countries they are used to produce drainage ditches with shallow V-shaped cross-sections on either side of highways.

[[Steering]] for a motor grader is typically accomplished via a [[steering wheel]] or [[joystick]] controlling the angle of the front wheels, but many models also allow frame [[articulated vehicle|articulation]] between the front and rear axles, which allows a smaller turning radius in addition to allowing the operator to adjust articulation angle to aid in the efficiency of moving material.  Other implement functions are typically hydraulically powered, and can be directly controlled by [[lever]]s, or by joystick inputs or electronic switches controlling [[Electrohydraulic servo valve]]s.

A more recent innovation is the outfitting of graders with grade control technologies, such as those manufactured by [[Topcon|Topcon Positioning Systems, Inc.]], [[Trimble Navigation]], [[Leica Geosystems]] or Mikrofyn&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mikrofyn.com&lt;/ref&gt; for precise grade control and (potentially) "stakeless" construction.  Manufacturers such as Caterpillar have also began to integrate these technologies into their machines out of the factory. (&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cat.com/en_US/articles/support/technology/grade-control-motorgraders.html&lt;/ref&gt;)

==History==
[[File:PazandakGrader1918.jpg|thumb|1918 grader]]
Early graders were drawn by [[manual labour|people]] and [[working animal|draft animals]]. The era of motorization by [[traction engine]]s, [[steam tractor]]s, [[truck|motor trucks]], and [[tractor]]s saw such [[towing|towed]] graders grow in size and productivity. The first self-propelled grader was made in 1920 by the Russell Grader Manufacturing Company, which called it the Russell Motor Hi-Way Patrol. These early graders were created by adding the grader blade as an attachment to a generalist tractor unit. After purchasing the company in 1928, [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] went on to truly integrate the tractor and grader into one design—at the same time replacing [[continuous track|crawler]] tracks with wheels to yield the first rubber-tire self-propelled grader, the Caterpillar Auto Patrol, released in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sKkMb8Nc9RYC&amp;pg=PA118|title=The Caterpillar Century|first=Eric|last=Orlemann|publisher=Motorbooks International|edition=2nd|year=2007|ISBN=978-0-7603-2961-0|page=118|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional uses==
[[File:Adams leaning wheel grader.jpg|thumb|Antique Adams leaning wheel road grader on display outside of Homer Public Works building, [[Homer, Alaska]]]]
In addition to their use in road construction, graders may also be used to perform roughly equivalent work.

In some locales such as [[Northern Europe]], [[Canada]], and places in the [[United States]], graders are often used in municipal and residential [[snow removal]]. In scrubland and grassland areas of [[Australia]] and [[Africa]], graders are often an essential piece of equipment on [[ranch]]es, large [[farm]]s, and [[plantation]]s to make dirt tracks where the absence of rocks and trees means bulldozers are not required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1554">'''Hexanit''' was a castable [[Germany|German]] military [[explosive]] developed early in the 20th century before the [[First World War]] for the [[Kaiserliche Marine]], intended to augment supplies of [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT), which were then in short supply. Hexanite is significantly more powerful than TNT on its own.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}  The most common hexanite formula (by weight) was 60% TNT and 40% [[hexanitrodiphenylamine]].

Typically, hexanite was used in underwater [[naval]] weapons e.g. [[warhead]]s for the [[G7a torpedo|G7a]] and [[G7e torpedo|G7e]] series [[torpedo]]es &lt;ref&gt;http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WTGER_WWII.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dutchsubmarines.com/specials/special_torpedoes_mines.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the 300 [[kilogram]] main explosive charge in [[aluminium]]-cased &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lhg.is/english/eod/&lt;/ref&gt; buoyant, moored "EMF" [[naval mine|magnetic mine]]s capable of being laid by [[U-boat]]s in 200, 300 or 500 metres of water.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WAMGER_Mines.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lhg.is/english/eod/mines/&lt;/ref&gt;

This explosive is regarded as [[obsolete]], so any hexanite-filled [[munition]]s encountered will be in the form of [[unexploded ordnance]] dating from the [[Second World War]].

The Japanese used this in World War II as explosive compound type 97 &amp; 98. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/rep/WDR/WDR58/WDR58-3.html#cn9&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15253">[[File:Cuban Wet Nurse - Curt Teich 1903.jpg|right|thumb|A Cuban woman using a goat to suckle a baby, 1903]]
'''Human–animal breastfeeding''' has been practiced in many different cultures in many time periods. The practice of [[breastfeeding]] or suckling between humans and other species has gone in both directions: human females sometimes breastfeed young animals, and animals are used to suckle babies and children. Animals were used as substitute [[wet nurse]]s for infants, particularly after the rise of [[syphilis]] increased the health risks of wet nursing. Goats and donkeys were widely used to feed abandoned babies in foundling hospitals in 18th- and 19th-century Europe. Breastfeeding animals has also been practised, whether for health reasons&amp;nbsp;– such as to toughen the nipples and improve the flow of milk&amp;nbsp;– or for religious and cultural purposes. A wide variety of animals have been used for this purpose, including puppies, kittens, piglets and monkeys.

==Suckling of animals by humans==
[[Terracotta]] feeding bottles surviving from the third millennium BC in [[Sumer]]ia indicate that children who were not being breastfed were receiving animal milk, probably from cows. It is possible that some infants directly suckled lactating animals,{{sfn|Van Esterik|1995|p=147}} which served as alternatives to [[wet nurse]]s. Unless another lactating woman was available, a mother who lacked enough breast milk was likely to lose her child. To avert that possibility if a wet nurse was not available, an animal such as a [[Asinus|donkey]], [[cow]], [[goat]], [[sheep]] or [[dog]] could be employed. Suckling directly was preferable to milking an animal and giving the milk, as contamination by [[microbe]]s during the milking process could lead to the infant contracting a deadly [[diarrhea]]l disease. It was not until as late as the 1870s that stored animal milk became safe to drink due to the invention of [[pasteurisation]] and sterilisation.{{sfn|Ensminger|1995|p=572}}

===Mythology and stories===
[[File:Romulus-Remus.jpg|right|thumb|Sculpture of Romulus, Remus and the Capitoline Wolf]]
The suckling of animals by infants was a repeated theme in [[classical mythology]]. Most famously, twin brothers [[Romulus and Remus]] (the former founded Rome) were portrayed as having been raised by a she-wolf which suckled the infants, as depicted in the iconic image of the [[Capitoline Wolf]]. The Greek god [[Zeus]] was said to have been brought up by [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]], portrayed variously as a goat who suckled the god or as a [[nymph]] who brought him up on the milk of her goat. Similarly, [[Telephus]], the son of the demigod [[Heracles]], was suckled by a deer.{{sfn|Savona-Ventura|2004|p=16}} Several famous ancient historical figures were claimed to have been suckled by animals; [[Cyrus I]] of Persia was said to have been suckled by a dog, while mares supposedly suckled [[Croesus]], [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] and [[Lysimachus]]. In reality, though, such stories probably owed more to myth-making about such prominent figures, as they were used as evidence of their future greatness.{{sfn|Radbill|1976|p=22}}

[[File:Bear suckling child.jpg|left|thumb|A bear suckling an abandoned child]]
Stories of abandoned children being brought up by animal mothers such as she-wolves and bears were widespread in Europe from the Middle Ages and into modern times. One real-life case was that of [[Peter the Wild Boy]], found in northern Germany in 1724. His coarse, curly hair was attributed to his being (supposedly) suckled by a bear, based on the premise that characteristics of the animal foster mother had been transmitted to him via her milk.{{sfn|Schiebinger|1993|p=56}} (It is now thought he had [[Pitt-Hopkins syndrome]], a condition unidentified until 1978.{{sfn|Kennedy|20 March 2011}})

===Perceived effect on character===
The belief that animal characteristics could be transmitted via milk was widely held; the Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]] thought that being suckled by [[lion]]esses conferred great courage.{{sfn|Schiebinger|1993|p=56}} Goats were thought to transmit a libidinous character and some preferred to employ donkeys as wet nurses instead, as they were thought to be more moral animals.{{sfn|Radbill|1976|p=24}} In modern Egypt, though, donkeys were disfavoured as wet nurses as it was thought that a child suckled on donkeys' milk would acquire the animal's stupidity and obstinacy.{{sfn|Omm Sety|2008|p=2}}

The teachings of the [[Quran]] discourage giving babies animal milk on the basis that animal traits might be transmitted along with it,{{sfn|Radbill|1976|p=22}} though the Jewish [[Talmud]] permits children to suckle animals if the child's welfare dictates it.{{sfn|Radbill|1976|p=23}} Human milk was thought to transmit character traits as well; in 19th century France a law was proposed to ban disreputable mothers from nursing their own children so that their immoral traits would not be transmitted via their milk.{{sfn|Radbill|1976|p=22}}

===Use of goats and other animals===
[[File:Direct udder nursing 1895.jpg|thumb|right|Donkeys suckling children in a French institution, 1895]]

Goats have often been used to suckle human babies and infants. The [[Khoikhoi]] of southern Africa were reported to tie their babies to the bellies of female goats so that they could feed there.{{cn|date=April 2018}} In the 18th and 19th centuries, goats were widely used in Europe as alternatives to human wet nurses, as they were easier to obtain, cheaper to use and safer, in that they were less prone to passing on diseases.{{sfn|Radbill|1976|p=24}} This use of animals was already a well-established practice in rural France and Italy; Pierre Brouzet, the personal physician of [[Louis XV of France]], wrote of how he had seen "some peasants who have no other nurses but ewes, and these peasants were as strong and vigorous as others."{{sfn|Valenze|2011|p=159}} In 1816, a German writer named Conrad A. Zweirlein overheard a conversation at a fashionable resort about the problems of wet nurses and responded by writing a book called ''The Goat as the Best and Most Agreeable Wet Nurse'', which popularised the use of the animals for many years.{{sfn|Radbill|1976|p=24}}

One important use of goats for suckling concerned the feeding and attempted cure of babies born with [[congenital syphilis]] inherited from their mothers. Liquid compounds laced with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] were fed to nanny goats&amp;nbsp;– if they refused to drink them, honey was recommended as a way of disguising the metallic taste&amp;nbsp;– or were ingested into the goat's bloodstream via a deliberately inflicted wound on the animal's leg that was covered with an ointment containing mercury. The mercury would accumulate in the [[goats' milk]] and was passed into the syphilitic babies when they suckled at the goats' teats. This method did have some effect of improving the infants' mortality rates, though the goats tended to die prematurely of [[mercury poisoning]].{{sfn|Burton|2007|pp=108–9}}

In France, homes for [[Child abandonment|foundlings]] (abandoned babies) often kept large numbers of goats to feed the infants, as they were considered less problematic than lower-class wet nurses. In some institutions, nurses (nannies) carried the infants to the goats; elsewhere, the goats came to the infants. Alphonse Le Roy described how goats were used at the [[foundling hospital]] in [[Aix-en-Provence]] in 1775: "The cribs are arranged in a large room in 2 ranks. Each goat which comes to feed enters bleating and goes to hunt the infant which has been given it, pushes back the covering with its horns and straddles the crib to give suck to the infant. Since that time they have raised very large numbers [of infants] in that hospital."{{sfn|Valenze|2011|p=159}}

In 19th-century Ireland, foundlings from [[Dublin]] were "sent to the mountains of [[Wicklow]], to feed upon the goats' milk. As the children grew older, the goats came to know them, and became very tame; so that the infant sought the goat, and was suckled by it as he would have been by a human wet nurse. These children throve remarkably well."{{sfn|Routh|1860|p=156}} Donkeys were preferred in England; as one writer has put it, "nothing was more picturesque than the spectacle of babies, held under the bellies of the donkeys in the stable adjoining the infants' ward, sucking contentedly the teats of the docile donkeys."{{sfn|Radbill|1976|p=24}} In [[Brittany]], attempts were made around 1900 to employ sows as wet nurses but foundered due to opposition to the use of pigs for this purpose.{{sfn|Radbill|1976|p=25}}

==Breastfeeding by humans of animals==

The breastfeeding by humans of animals is a practice that is widely attested historically and continues to be practised today by some cultures. The reasons for this are varied: to feed young animals, to drain a woman's breasts, to promote lactation, to harden the nipples before a baby is born, to prevent conception, and so on.{{sfn|Radbill|1976|p=26}} 

English and German physicians between the 16th and 18th centuries recommended using puppies to "draw" the mother's breasts, and in 1799 the German [[Friedrich Benjamin Osiander]] reported that in [[Göttingen]] women suckled young dogs to dislodge nodules from their breasts.{{sfn|Radbill|1976|p=26}} An example of the practice being used for health reasons comes from late 18th century England. When the writer [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] was dying of [[puerperal fever]] following the birth of her second daughter, the doctor ordered that puppies be applied to her breasts to draw off the milk, possibly with the intention of helping her womb to contract to expel the infected [[placenta]] that was slowly poisoning her.{{sfn|Tomalin|2004|pp=280–1}} 

Animals have widely been used to toughen the nipples and maintain the mother's milk supply. In Persia and Turkey puppies were used for this purpose. The same method was practised in the United States in the early 19th century; [[William Potts Dewees]] recommended in 1825 that from the eighth month of pregnancy, expectant mothers should regularly use a puppy to harden the nipples, improve breast secretion and prevent inflammation of the breasts. The practice seems to have fallen out of favour by 1847, as Dewees suggested using a nurse or some other skilled person to carry out this task rather than an animal.{{sfn|Radbill|1976|p=2–7}} 

Religious and ceremonial reasons have also been a factor. Saint [[Veronica Giuliani]] (1660–1727), an Italian nun and mystic, was known for taking a lamb to bed with her and suckling it as a symbol of the [[Lamb of God]].{{sfn|Schiebinger|1993|p=56}} In far northern [[Japan]], the [[Ainu people]] are noted for holding [[Iomante|an annual bear festival]] at which a captured bear, raised and suckled by the women, is sacrificed. 

Bears were also suckled by the [[Itelmens]] of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] of Russia but in their case for economic reasons, to benefit from the meat when the bear was grown and to obtain highly prized [[Bile bear|bear bile]] for use in traditional medicine.{{sfn|Radbill|1976|p=26}}

Tribal peoples around the world have breastfed many types of animal. Travelers in [[Guyana]] observed native women breastfeeding a variety of animals, including [[monkey]]s, [[opossum]]s, [[paca]]s, [[agouti]]s, [[peccary|peccaries]] and [[deer]].{{sfn|Radbill|1976|p=26}} Native Canadians and Americans often breastfed young dogs; an observer commented that the [[Pima people]] of [[Arizona]] "withdrew their breasts sooner from their own infants than from young dogs."{{sfn|Radbill|1976|p=27}}

In the present day, the act of breastfeeding animals has been used as a sometimes controversial artistic statement. The album art for ''[[Boys for Pele]]'' by [[Tori Amos]] includes a photograph of the singer breastfeeding a piglet.{{sfn|Farley|11 May 1998}} In Ireland, 22-year-old model and [[PETA]] member Agata Dembiecka became the focus of controversy in 2010 when a calendar issued by an animal rescue charity featured a photograph of her suckling a puppy.{{sfn|Belfast Telegraph|30 December 2010}}

'''Hung Pham''' or '''Hung Kim Pham''' (born Phạm Kim Hưng; October 2, 1963 in [[Saigon]]) is a former politician and information expert in [[Alberta]], Canada. He formerly served as a member of [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], Canada.

==Early life==
Born and growing up in [[Saigon]], the capital of [[South Vietnam]], Hung Pham was one of the boat people leaving the country after [[Vietnam War]]. Coming to Canada in 1980 at the age of 16 without English, teenager Hung Pham worked as a part-time janitor to make his living while going to high-school in [[Calgary]].

==Education==
Hung Pham completed his high-school education in 1982 and subsequently took the computer science university transfer program at [[Mount Royal College]], where he received many awards and scholarships for outstanding academic achievements. Pham then transferred to [[University of Calgary]] in 1984 and graduated from the university in 1986 with two bachelor's degrees with Distinction: Bachelor of Science with Distinction in [[Computer Science]] and Bachelor of Science with Distinction in [[Pure Mathematics]]. He went on to take Master program at University of Calgary, specializing in [[Artificial Intelligence]].

==Career==
Starting as a prominent Information Analyst with Canalta Data Services in 1988, Hung Pham joined The City of Calgary in 1989 as a Database Technical Analyst. He was promoted by The City of Calgary to be Senior Programmer Analyst in 1991.

==Community activities==
As an active member of many non-profit organizations, Hung Pham helped Calgary Police Service with her multicultural and crime prevention programs. He was elected President of Calgary Vietnamese Canadian Association in 1990. At that position, Pham promoted programs to help low income workers. With his well-known speech delivered to the community on 1991 [[Tết]] celebration event, Pham publicly declared his programs to help cleaners in Calgary.

==Political career==
Elected to Legislative Assembly of Alberta (Progressive Conservative), Canada at the age of 29, Hung Pham was the youngest Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) in Alberta Legislature at the time. He is also the very first Vietnamese ever elected to a state legislature outside of Vietnam in history.

Re-elected four times later, Hung Pham has held many high-rank positions in Alberta Government. In 2006, he was promoted by Premier Ed Stelmach to be a member of Alberta Treasury Board, the legislative body responsible for all expenditures and budgets of Alberta (Premier Ed Stelmach is also a member of the board).

In January, 2008, Hung Pham announced that he would not seek re-election. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The institute provides a bridge between Texas A&amp;M University System scientists and other institutions' researchers working in the Texas Medical Center and the biomedical and biotechnology research community in Houston. It emphasizes collaboration between member scientists and others working in all the fields of the biosciences and biotechnology. IBT encourages its scientists to transfer discoveries made in their laboratories to the clinic and marketplace.

==History==
The IBT was first established as part of the [[Texas A&amp;M University System]] with the broad goal to expand [[biotechnology]] in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Texas A&amp;M System Board of Regents Minute Order Number 245-86, 1986; Higher Education Code, Title 3, Chapter 86, Subchapter D, Section 86.61, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for an institutional campus in Houston came to fruition in 1986 under Mr. David Eller (Chairman of the [[Texas A&amp;M University System]] Board of Regents) and Dr. Richard Wainerdi (Chairman and CEO of the [[Texas Medical Center]]).  Dr. Eugene G. Sander, head of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics in the [[Texas A&amp;M College of Agriculture and Life Sciences]] (COALS) was named first director of the institute.  The Robert A. Welch Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welch1.org The Welch Foundation Website]&lt;/ref&gt; endowed a $1 million Robert A. Welch Chair in 1990.

In 1988 the institute administration was moved from the [[Texas A&amp;M University System]] to the [[Texas A&amp;M University]] under the leadership of Dr. Charles Arntzen, Vice Chancellor of Agriculture and Dean of the College of Life Sciences and Agriculture (COALS).  Arntzen secured a grant from the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] for $12.5 million and other private donations including one from Texas oilman Albert B. Alkek to build the Albert B. Alkek Institute of Biosciences and Technology Building in the Texas Medical Center at a cost of $21.5 million.  The 11-story building stands on the former site of the historic [[Shamrock Hotel]].  Under Arntzen’s leadership, Centers for Animal Genetics, Advanced Invertebrate Molecular Sciences and Biotechnology Policy and Ethics were established and funding secured for additional endowed chairs from the Allen, John S. Dunn, and Neva and Wesley West (see [[Wesley West]]) Foundations.  In 1990, he recruited Dr. Robert D. Wells into the Welch Chair as Chairman of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics (COALS) and Director of the IBT.  Under Wells directorship (1990–1994), Centers for Genome Research, Macromolecular Design, Extracellular Matrix Biology, Crop Biotechnology, Animal Biotechnology, Genome Informatics and Cancer Biology were established.

Dr. Fuller W. Bazer was Director from 1994-2001.  Under the Bazer administration by agreement between the [[Texas A&amp;M University]] President Ray Bowen and [[The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] President Dr. David Low, the University of Texas' Institute of Molecular Medicine for Prevention of Human Disease (Hans Muller-Eberhard, Director)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uth.tmc.edu/uth_orgs/imm Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine for Prevention of Human Disease] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230100628/http://www.uth.tmc.edu/uth_orgs/imm/ |date=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was established on two floors of the IBT building.  During this period similar cooperative efforts between [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and [[The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] resulted in acceptance of IBT Texas A&amp;M faculty into the UT Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.  The building became a hub for the Texas GigaPop and similar high speed, broad bandwidth internet activities of the Texas A&amp;M University’s Academy for Advanced Telecommunications and Distance Learning.  In 1997 the IBT became a college level unit of the newly established [[Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center]].

Dr. Richard Finnell served as director 2001-2005 under whose leadership the [[Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine]] (TIGM) was established.  Dr. Robert Schwartz served as director for 2006-2009.  In 2007 a self-study called for a strategic plan in which the IBT would be the founding basic research element of a broader Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center Houston Campus representing all components of the Health Science Center in Houston.  Dr. David Carlson, the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center Vice President of Research and Graduate Studies served as the interim IBT Director 2009-2011. In 2011 Dr. Cheryl Lyn Walker was appointed as the current Director of IBT.

==Organizational structure==
Under its college level status within the [[Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center]], the IBT consists of thematic Centers (departments) led by a Center Director and tenured and tenure-track faculty, research track faculty and associate and adjunct faculty.

The approximately $10 million operating budget of the IBT consists of about 30% state funds, 50% federal grants and 20% private sources.  Current Centers include [[Cancer]] and [[Stem Cell]] Biology (formerly Cancer Biology and [[Nutrition]]), Epigenetics and Disease Prevention, Environmental and Genetic Medicine,  Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases (formerly [[Extracellular matrix]] Biology) and Translational Cancer Research.

The IBT Graduate Program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibt.tamhsc.edu/grad_training IBT Graduate Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061223170709/http://www.ibt.tamhsc.edu/grad_training/ |date=2006-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of students from the [[Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences]], other Texas A&amp;M System programs, [[The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and other programs in [[Texas Medical Center]] institutions in which faculty have joint graduate faculty appointments.  Students do research in IBT laboratories while taking formal classroom instruction at other Texas Medical Center institutions.

In addition to the IBT, the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center Alkek Building hosts the Houston division of the [[Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tigm.org/ Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; representatives of the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center College of Medicine, School of Rural Public Health and Baylor College of Dentistry.  Two floors of the building are dedicated to a partnership with the Department of Medicine of [[The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center]].

'''Isopropyl nitrate''' (IPN, 2-propyl nitrate) is a colorless liquid [[monopropellant]].  It is used as a [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] [[cetane number|cetane]] improver.  IPN is a low-sensitivity explosive, with a [[Explosive velocity|detonation velocity]] of approximately 5400&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intdetsymp.org/detsymp2002/PaperSubmit/FinalManuscript/pdf/Zhang-131.pdf#search=%22%22isopropyl%20nitrate%22%20IPN%22 Shock initiation and detonability of isopropyl nitrate]&lt;/ref&gt;

Isopropyl nitrate is extremely flammable and burns with a practically invisible flame. This presents unique hazards in its handling. The flame is significantly less [[luminous flame|luminous]] than hydrogen or methanol flame and is only visible due to the turbulent hot air it generates.

Isopropyl nitrate was previously used in a [[jet engine]] rapid starting system for military interceptor aircraft (a requirement for fast [[Scrambling (military)|scrambling]], as it provided simultaneous, near-instantaneous engine starting for twin engines) and was known as AVPIN.&lt;ref name="R-R, AVPIN" &gt;{{Cite book

| chapter=11: Starting and Ignition
| publisher=[[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]]
| isbn=978-0-902121-04-1
| year=1986
| ref={{harvid|Rolls-Royce|Jet Engine}}
| pages=124–125
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhaust fumes from an AVPIN monopropellant engine may themselves be explosive, if mixed with further air. 

Early systems, as used on the [[Gloster Javelin]], used a simple pressurising cartridge and had a poor reputation for misfires, including engine-destroying explosions. Nevertheless, [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]] was able to demonstrate that the fuel is extremely stable and that a [[Shell (projectile)|cannon shell]] could be fired through a container of it with no dramatic effect. Isopropyl nitrate was also sold by the [[Turbonique]] company under the brand name "Thermolene" as a fuel for their line of turbine-powered "drag axles" and superchargers, during the 1960s.

It is officially classed as safe to transport provided it is labelled as flammable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821165313/http://www.btinternet.com/~javelin/p08_technical_notes/p08_technical_notes.htm | title=Javelin Technical Notes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although engine starters do not require an air supply for their basic operation, air was supplied to later designs, such as that of the [[English Electric Lightning]], by an automatic scavenge pump simply to control these fumes.&lt;ref name="R-R, AVPIN" /&gt; The history of AVPIN use on the Lightning demonstrated it was both safe and effective in use. The reduced availability of AVPIN is now a restriction on the continued operation of some preserved military aircraft, such as Lightnings in the UK and South Africa and some are thus being converted to electric starting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boardreader.com/thread/XS458_T5_lightning_video_LAST_EVER_AVPIN_ogvX2e48.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003135146/http://boardreader.com/thread/XS458_T5_lightning_video_LAST_EVER_AVPIN_ogvX2e48.html |archivedate=2013-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pprune.org/archive/index.php/t-191175.html | title=Hunters &amp; Lightnings &amp;#91;Archive&amp;#93; - PPRuNe Forums}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been used as a [[fuel]] for power supply and actuation in guided weapons, notably in the British [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dstan.mod.uk/data/91/089/00000200.pdf Def Stan 91-89 Issue 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008050028/http://www.dstan.mod.uk/data/91/089/00000200.pdf |date=2007-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With further research, large-scale chemical processing in a refinery-style environment could help process millions of gallons of "pig biocrude" per day.

'''Nanophotonics''' or '''nano-optics''' is the study of the behavior of [[light]] on the [[nanometer]] scale, and of the interaction of nanometer-scale objects with light. It is a  branch of [[optics]], [[optical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[nanotechnology]]. It often (but not exclusively) involves metallic components, which can transport and focus light via [[surface plasmon polariton]]s.

The term "nano-optics", just like the term "optics", usually refers to situations involving [[ultraviolet]], [[visible light|visible]], and [[near-infrared]] light (free-space wavelengths from 300 to 1200 nanometers).

== Background ==

Normal optical components, like lenses and microscopes, generally cannot normally focus light to nanometer (deep [[subwavelength]]) scales, because of the [[diffraction limit]] ([[Rayleigh criterion]]). Nevertheless, it is possible to squeeze light into a nanometer scale using other techniques like, for example, [[surface plasmon]]s, [[localized surface plasmon]]s around nanoscale metal objects, and the nanoscale apertures and nanoscale sharp tips used in [[near-field scanning optical microscopy]] (NSOM) and photoassisted [[scanning tunnelling microscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;Hewakuruppu, Y., et al., ''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257069746_Plasmonic__pump__probe__method_to_study_semi-transparent_nanofluids?ev=prf_pub Plasmonic " pump – probe " method to study semi-transparent nanofluids] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181913/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257069746_Plasmonic__pump__probe__method_to_study_semi-transparent_nanofluids?ev=prf_pub |date=March 3, 2016 }}'', Applied Optics, 52(24):6041-6050&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations ==

Nanophotonics researchers pursue a very wide variety of goals, in fields ranging from biochemistry to electrical engineering. A few of these goals are summarized below.

===Optoelectronics and microelectronics===

If light can be squeezed into a small volume, it can be absorbed and detected by a small detector. Small [[photodetector]]s tend to have a variety of desirable properties including low noise, high speed, and low voltage and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature |title=Reinventing germanium avalanche photodetector for nanophotonic on-chip optical interconnects |doi=10.1038/nature08813 |pmid=20203606 |year=2010 |last1=Assefa |first1=Solomon |last2=Xia |first2=Fengnian |last3=Vlasov |first3=Yurii A. |volume=464 |issue=7285 |pages=80–4 |bibcode = 2010Natur.464...80A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tadias1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tadias.com/03/08/2010/research-discovery-by-ethiopian-scientist-at-ibm/ |title=Research Discovery By Ethiopian Scientist At IBM at Tadias Magazine |publisher=Tadias.com |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/41904 |title=Avalanche photodetector breaks speed record |publisher=physicsworld.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small [[laser]]s have various desirable properties for [[optical communication]] including low threshold current (which helps power efficiency) and fast modulation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1038/nphys3103 |authors = Themistoklis P. H. Sidiropoulos, Robert Röder, Sebastian Geburt, Ortwin Hess, Stefan A. Maier, Carsten Ronning, Rupert F. Oulton |title = Ultrafast plasmonic nanowire lasers near the surface plasmon frequency |journal = Nature Physics | date = 2014|bibcode = 2014NatPh..10..870S |volume=10 |pages=870–876}} [http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_29-9-2014-8-43-35 Press release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225035129/http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_29-9-2014-8-43-35 |date=December 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which means more data transmission). Very small lasers require [[subwavelength]] [[optical cavity|optical cavities]]. An example is [[spaser]]s, the [[surface plasmon]] version of lasers.

Integrated circuits are made using [[photolithography]], i.e. exposure to light. In order to make very small transistors, the light needs to be focused into extremely sharp images. Using various techniques such as [[immersion lithography]] and phase-shifting [[photomask]]s, it has indeed been possible to make images much finer than the wavelength—for example, drawing 30&amp;nbsp;nm lines using 193&amp;nbsp;nm light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Aaron | last=Hand | title=High-Index Lenses Push Immersion Beyond 32 nm | url=http://www.reed-electronics.com/semiconductor/article/CA6319061}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasmonic techniques have also been proposed for this application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Maskless Plasmonic Lithography at 22 nm Resolution |authors=Liang Pan |url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2011/111129/srep00175/full/srep00175.html |doi=10.1038/srep00175 |journal=Scientific Reports |date=2011|bibcode = 2011NatSR...1E.175P |display-authors=etal |volume=1 |pmid=22355690 |pmc=3240963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heat-assisted magnetic recording]] is a nanophotonic approach to increasing the amount of data that a magnetic disk drive can store. It requires a laser to heat a tiny, subwavelength area of the magnetic material before writing data. The magnetic write-head would have metal optical components to concentrate light at the right location.

Miniaturization in [[optoelectronics]], for example the miniaturization of transistors in [[integrated circuit]]s, has improved their speed and cost. However, [[optoelectronic]] circuits can only be miniaturized if the optical components are shrunk along with the electronic components. This is relevant for on-chip [[optical communication]] (i.e. passing information from one part of a microchip to another by sending light through optical waveguides, instead of changing the voltage on a wire).&lt;ref name="tadias1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_projects.nsf/pages/photonics.index.html |title=IBM Research &amp;#124; IBM Research &amp;#124; Silicon Integrated Nanophotonics |publisher=Domino.research.ibm.com |date=2010-03-04 |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar cells===
[[Solar cells]] often work best when the light is absorbed very close to the surface, both because electrons near the surface have a better chance of being collected, and because the device can be made thinner, which reduces cost. Researchers have investigated a variety of nanophotonic techniques to intensify light in the optimal locations within a solar cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1002/adma.201000488 |volume = 22 |issue = 43 |pages = 4794–4808 |authors = Vivian E. Ferry, Jeremy N. Munday, Harry A. Atwater |title = Design Considerations for Plasmonic Photovoltaics |journal = Advanced Materials |date = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spectroscopy===

''Using nanophotonics to create high peak intensities'': If a given amount of light energy is squeezed into a smaller and smaller volume ("hot-spot"), the intensity in the hot-spot gets larger and larger. This is especially helpful in [[nonlinear optics]]; an example is [[surface enhanced Raman scattering]]. It also allows sensitive [[spectroscopy]] measurements of even single molecules located in the hot-spot, unlike traditional spectroscopy methods which take an average over millions or billions of molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2014.06.016 | volume=588 | title=Enhancing single-molecule fluorescence with nanophotonics | journal=FEBS Letters | pages=3547–3552}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chemical mapping of a single molecule by plasmon-enhanced Raman scattering |journal=Nature |volume=498 |pages=82–86 |date=6 June 2013 |doi=10.1038/nature12151 |authors=R.

===Microscopy===

One goal of nanophotonics is to construct a so-called "[[superlens]]", which would use [[metamaterial]]s (see below) or other techniques to create images that are more accurate than the diffraction limit (deep [[subwavelength]]).

[[Near-field scanning optical microscope]] (NSOM or SNOM) is a quite different nanophotonic technique that accomplishes the same goal of taking images with resolution far smaller than the wavelength. It involves raster-scanning a very sharp tip or very small aperture over the surface to be imaged.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Near-field microscopy refers more generally to any technique using the near-field (see below) to achieve nanoscale, subwavelength resolution. For example, [[dual polarization interferometry]] has picometer resolution in the vertical plane above the waveguide surface.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Principles==

===Plasmons and metal optics===
{{main|Plasmon|Surface plasmon}}

Metals are an effective way to confine light to far below the wavelength. This was originally used in radio and [[microwave engineering]], where metal [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s and [[waveguide]]s may be hundreds of times smaller than the free-space wavelength. For a similar reason, visible light can be confined to the nano-scale via nano-sized metal structures, such as nano-sized structures, tips, gaps, etc. This effect is somewhat analogous to a lightning rod, where the field concentrates at the tip.

This effect is fundamentally based on the fact that the [[permittivity]] of the metal is very large and negative. At very high frequencies (near and above the [[plasma frequency]], usually ultraviolet), the permittivity of a metal is not so large, and the metal stops being useful for concentrating fields.

Many nano-optics designs look like common microwave or radiowave circuits, but shrunk down by a factor of 100,000 or more. After all, radiowaves, microwaves, and visible light are all electromagnetic radiation; they differ only in frequency. So other things equal, a microwave circuit shrunk down by a factor of 100,000 will behave the same way but at 100,000 times higher frequency. For example, researchers have made nano-optical [[Yagi-Uda antenna]]s following essentially the same design as used for radio Yagi-Uda antennas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature Communications |title=3D optical Yagi–Uda nanoantenna array |authors=Daniel Dregely, Richard Taubert, Jens Dorfmüller, Ralf Vogelgesang, Klaus Kern, Harald Giessen |volume=2 |number=267 |doi=10.1038/ncomms1268|bibcode = 2011NatCo...2E.267D |pages=267 |pmid=21468019 |pmc=3104549}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:SEM-Yagi-text.jpg|thumb|Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a five-element Yagi-Uda antenna consisting of a feed element, one reflector, and three directors, fabricated by e-beam lithography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van Hulst|first1=Niek|title=Optical Nano-antenna Controls Single Quantum Dot Emission|url=http://www.2physics.com/2010/10/optical-nano-antenna-controls-single.html|website=2physics|publisher=2physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Metallic parallel-plate [[waveguides]] (striplines), lumped-constant [[Electrical circuit|circuit]] elements such as [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]] (at [[visible light]] frequencies, the values of the latter being of the order of femtohenries and attofarads, respectively), and impedance-matching of [[dipole]] [[antennas]] to [[transmission lines]], all familiar techniques at [[microwave]] frequencies, are some current areas of nanophotonics development. That said, there are a number of very important differences between nano-optics and scaled-down microwave circuits. For example, at optical frequency, metals behave much less like ideal conductors, and also exhibit interesting plasmon-related effects like [[kinetic inductance]] and [[surface plasmon resonance]]. Likewise, optical fields interact with [[semiconductor]]s in a fundamentally different way than microwaves do.

===Near-field optics===
{{main|Near-field optics|Near and far field}}

If you take the [[Fourier transform]] of an object, it consists of different [[spatial frequencies]]. The higher frequencies correspond to the very fine features and sharp edges.

When light is emitted by such an object, the light with very high spatial frequency forms an [[evanescent wave]], which only exists in the [[Near and far field|near field]] (very close to the object, within a wavelength or two) and disappears in the [[near and far field|far field]]. This is the origin of the [[diffraction limit]], which says that when a lens images an object, the subwavelength information is blurred out.

Nano-photonics is primarily concerned with the near-field evanescent waves. For example, a [[superlens]] (mentioned above) would prevent the decay of the evanescent wave, allowing higher-resolution imaging.

===Metamaterials===
{{main|Metamaterial}}

[[Metamaterial]]s are artificial materials engineered to have properties that may not be found in nature. They are created by fabricating an array of structures much smaller than a wavelength. The small (nano) size of the structures is important: That way, light interacts with them as if they made up a uniform, continuous medium, rather than scattering off the individual structures.

The term '''Norman architecture''' is used to categorise styles of [[Romanesque architecture]] developed by the [[Normans]] in the various lands under their dominion or influence in the 11th and 12th centuries. In particular the term is traditionally used for English Romanesque architecture.  The Normans introduced large numbers of [[castle]]s and [[fortification]]s  including Norman [[keep]]s, and at the same time [[monastery|monasteries]], [[abbey]]s, [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[cathedral]]s, in a style characterised by the usual Romanesque rounded [[arch]]es (particularly over windows and doorways) and especially massive proportions compared to other regional variations of the style.

==Origins==
These [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] styles originated in [[Normandy]] and became widespread in north western [[Europe]], particularly in [[England]], which contributed considerable development and has the largest number of surviving examples. At about the same time [[Hauteville family|a Norman dynasty]] ruled in [[Sicily]], producing a distinctive variation incorporating [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Saracen]] influences which is also known as Norman architecture, or alternatively as Sicilian Romanesque. Ancient Rome's invention of the arch is the basis of all Norman architecture.

The term may have originated with eighteenth-century [[antiquarian]]s, but its usage in a sequence of styles has been attributed to [[Thomas Rickman]] in his 1817 work ''An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation'' which used the labels "Norman, Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular". The more inclusive term ''romanesque'' was used of the [[Romance languages]] in English by 1715,&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] "Romanesque": in French a letter of 1818 by [[Charles-Alexis-Adrien Duhérissier de Gerville]] seems to be the first&lt;/ref&gt; and was applied to architecture of the eleventh and twelfth centuries from 1819.&lt;ref&gt;OED same entry; in French by Gerville's friend [[Arcisse de Caumont]] in his ''Essaie sur l'architecture du moyen âge, particulièrement en Normandie,'' 1824.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[Edward the Confessor]] built [[Westminster Abbey]] in Romanesque style (now all replaced by later rebuildings) just before the Conquest, which is still believed to be the earliest major Romanesque building in England, no significant remaining Romanesque architecture in Britain can clearly be shown to predate the Conquest, although historians believe that many surviving "Norman" elements in buildings, nearly all churches, may well in fact be Anglo-Saxon.

==Norman arch==

The Norman arch is a defining point of Norman architecture. Grand [[arch]]ways are designed to evoke feelings of [[awe]] and are very commonly seen as the entrance to large [[religious]] buildings such as [[cathedral]]s.

==Normandy==
[[Viking]] invaders arrived at the mouth of the [[river Seine]] in 911, at a time when [[Franks]] were fighting on horseback and Frankish lords were building castles. Over the next century the population of the territory ceded to the Vikings, now called [[Normans]], adopted these customs as well as Christianity and the ''[[langue d'oïl]]''. Norman barons built timber castles on earthen mounds, beginning the development of [[motte-and-bailey]] castles, and great stone churches in the Romanesque style of the Franks. By 950, they were building stone [[keep]]s. The Normans were among the most travelled peoples of Europe, exposing them to a wide variety of cultural influences which became incorporated in their art and architecture.  They elaborated on the early Christian basilica plan. Originally longitudinal with side aisles and an apse they began to add in towers, as at the Church of Saint-Étienne]] at Caen, in 1067. This would eventually form a model for the larger English [[cathedral]]s some 20 years later.

==England==
[[File:Andover - Norman Arch - geograph.org.uk - 556600.jpg|thumb|A Norman arch c. 1150 in [[Andover, Hampshire]]]]
[[File:Norman arch.jpg|thumb |A Norman arch with zig-zag mouldings above the church doorway at [[Guiting Power]], [[Gloucestershire]]]]
In [[England]], Norman nobles and bishops had influence before the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, and Norman influences affected late [[Anglo-Saxon architecture]]. [[Edward the Confessor]] was brought up in Normandy and in 1042 brought masons to work on the first Romanesque building in England, [[Westminster Abbey]]. In 1051 he brought in Norman [[knight]]s who built "motte" castles as a defence against the [[Wales|Welsh]]. Following the invasion, Normans rapidly constructed [[motte-and-bailey]] castles along with  [[Church (building)|churches]], [[abbey]]s, and more elaborate [[fortification]]s such as Norman stone [[keep]]s.

The buildings show massive proportions in simple geometries using small bands of [[sculpture]]. Paying attention to the concentrated spaces of [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s and round doorways as well as the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] under an arch. The "Norman arch" is the rounded, often with mouldings carved or incised onto it for decoration. [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron patterns]], frequently termed "zig-zag [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]]", were a frequent signature of the Normans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Edward |title=ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ROMANESQUE AND GOTHIC |journal=The Archaeological Review |date=December 1888 |volume=2 |issue=4 |page=237-251 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/44245200 |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Cruciform#Cruciform architectural plan|cruciform church]]es often had deep [[chancel]]s and a square [[crossing tower]] which has remained a feature of English [[ecclesiastical architecture]]. Hundreds of [[parish]] churches were built and the great English [[cathedral]]s were founded from 1083.

After a fire damaged [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in 1174 Norman masons introduced the new [[Gothic architecture]]. Around 1191 [[Wells Cathedral]] and [[Lincoln Cathedral]] brought in the English Gothic style, and Norman became increasingly a modest style of provincial building.

==Scotland==
[[Scotland]] also came under early Norman influence with Norman nobles at the court of King [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]] around 1050. His successor [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Máel Coluim III]] overthrew him with English and Norman assistance, and his queen, [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]], encouraged the church. The [[Benedictine]] order founded a monastery at [[Dunfermline]]. Her sixth and youngest son, who became [[David I of Scotland|King David]], built [[St. Margaret's Chapel]] at the start of the 12th century.

==Ireland==
The Normans first landed in Ireland in 1169. Within five years earthwork castles were springing up, and in a further five, work was beginning on some of the earliest of the great stone castles. For example, [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Hugh de Lacy]] built a [[Motte-and-bailey]] castle on the site of the present day [[Trim Castle]], [[County Meath]], which was attacked and burned in 1173 by the Irish king [[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair]]. De Lacy, however, then constructed a stone castle in its place, which enclosed over three acres within its walls, and this could not be burned down by the Irish. The years between 1177 and 1310 saw the construction of some of the greatest of the Norman castles in Ireland. The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of [[Ireland]], later known as [[the Pale]], and among other buildings they constructed were [[Swords Castle]] in [[Fingal]] (North County Dublin), [[Dublin Castle]] and [[Carrickfergus Castle]] in [[County Antrim]].&lt;ref&gt;Castles in Ireland Feudal Power in a Gaelic World. by Tom McNeill. (London, 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-415-22853-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==

===Mezzogiorno===
The Normans began constructing castles, their trademark architectural piece, in Italy from an early date. [[William Iron Arm]] built one at an unidentified location (Stridula) in [[Calabria]] in 1045. After the death of [[Robert Guiscard]] in 1085, the [[Mezzogiorno]] (peninsular southern Italy) experienced a series of civil wars and fell under the control of increasingly weaker princes. Revolts characterised the region until well into the twelfth century and minor lords sought to resist ducal or royal power from within their own castles. In the [[Molise]], the Normans embarked on their most extensive castle-building programme and introduced the ''[[opus gallicum]]'' technique to Italy. Their clever use of the local stone artisans, together with the vast riches amassed from their enslaved population, made such tremendous feats possible. Some as majestic as those of the ancient Roman structures they tried to emulate.

Besides the [[encastellation]] of the countryside, the Normans erected several religious buildings which still survive. They edified the shrine at [[Monte Sant'Angelo]] and built a [[mausoleum]] to the [[Hauteville family]] at [[Venosa]]. They also built many new Latin monasteries, including the famous foundation of {{ill|Sant'Eufemia Lamezia|lt=Sant'Eufemia|it}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlante.beniculturalicalabria.it/schede.php?id=178 |title=Abbazia Benedettina di Sant’ Eufemia |accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of great importance are the portal of the [[Shrine of Mary Queen of Anglona]] and the ambulatory and radiating chapels of the [[Aversa Cathedral]]. In [[Salerno]], however, remember Fruscione Palace.

Here is a list of Norman architecture in the Mezzogiorno : 
* Castle of Circello. 
* Castle Monforte (Campobasso).

===Sicily===
{{further|Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture}}

[[File:Cefalucathedralnight.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Cefalu]]]]
[[Sicily]]'s Norman period lasted from circa 1070 until about 1200.  The architecture was decorated in [[gilding|gild]]ed mosaics such as that at the cathedral at [[Monreale]].  The Palatine Chapel in [[Palermo]] built in 1130 is perhaps the strongest example of this. The interior of the [[dome]], (itself a Byzantine feature), is decorated in a [[mosaic]] depicting Christ Pantocrator accompanied by his [[angel]]s.

During Sicily's later Norman era early Gothic influences can be detected such as those in the [[Messina Cathedral|cathedral]] at Messina consecrated in 1197.  However, here the high Gothic [[campanile]] is of a later date and should not be confused with the early Gothic built during the Norman period; which featured pointed arches and windows rather than the [[flying buttress]]es and [[pinnacle]]s later to manifest themselves in the Gothic era.

===Malta===
After its Norman conquest in 1091, Malta saw the construction of several Norman pieces of architecture. Many have been demolished and rebuilt over the years (especially after the [[1693 Sicily earthquake]] which destroyed many old Norman buildings), however some fortresses and houses still exist in [[Mdina]] and [[Vittoriosa]].

==Transitional style==
As [[stone mason|master mason]]s developed the style and experimented with ways of overcoming the geometric difficulties of [[groin vault]]ed ceilings, they introduced features such as the pointed arch that were later characterised as being [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] in style. Architectural historians and scholars consider that a style must be assessed as an integral whole rather than an aggregate of features, and while some include these developments within the Norman or Romanesque styles, others describe them as transitional or "Norman–Gothic Transitional". A few websites use the term "Norman Gothic", but it is unclear whether they refer to the transitional style or to the Norman style as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britainexpress.com/History/Gothic-architecture.htm |title=Gothic Architecture in England |publisher=Britainexpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racine.ra.it/ungaretti/gothic/norman_gothic.htm |title=Norman Gothic |publisher=Racine.ra.it |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Norman==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
Neo-Norman architecture is a type of [[Romanesque Revival architecture]] based on Norman Romanesque architecture. There is sometimes confusion, especially in North America, between this style and revivalist versions of vernacular or later [[architecture of Normandy]], such as the "Norman farmhouse style" popular for larger houses.

Romanesque Revival versions focus on the arch and capitals, and decorated doorways.  There are two examples in Manchester: the former Stock Exchange building and a synagogue in [[Fallowfield]].

An '''optical power meter''' ('''OPM''') is a device used  measure the power in an [[optical]] signal. The term usually refers to a device for testing average power in [[fiber optic]] systems. Other general purpose light power measuring devices are usually called [[radiometer]]s, [[photometer]]s, [[laser]] power meters (can be [[photodiode]] sensors or [[Thermopile Laser Sensors|thermopile laser sensors]]), [[light meter]]s or lux meters.

A typical optical power meter consists of a [[calibrated]] [[sensor]], measuring [[amplifier]] and display.
The sensor primarily consists of a [[photodiode]] selected for the appropriate range of [[wavelength]]s and power levels.
On the display unit, the measured optical power and set wavelength is displayed. Power meters are calibrated using a traceable calibration standard such as a [[NIST]] standard.

A traditional optical power meter responds to a [[Electromagnetic spectrum|broad spectrum]] of light, however the calibration is wavelength dependent. This is not normally an issue, since the test wavelength is usually known, however it has a couple of drawbacks. Firstly, the user must set the meter to the correct test wavelength, and secondly if there are other spurious wavelengths present, then wrong readings will result.

Sometimes optical power meters are combined with a different test function such as an Optical Light Source (OLS) or Visual Fault Locator (VFL), or may be a [[sub-system]] in a much larger instrument. When combined with a light source, the instrument is usually called an Optical Loss Test Set.

Optical Loss Test Sets (OLTS) are available in dedicated [[hand held]] instruments and platform-based modules to suit various network architectures and test requirements. They are used to measure optical power and power loss, and reflectance and reflected power loss. The products may also be used as optical sources or optical power meters, or to measure optical return loss or event reflectance.

Three types of equipment can be used to measure optical power loss:
#''Component equipment'' - Optical Power Meters (OPMs) and Stabilized Light Sources (SLSs) are packaged separately, but when used together they can provide a measurement of end-to-end optical attenuation over an optical path. Such component equipment can also be used for other measurements.
#''Integrated test set'' - When an SLS and OPM are packaged in one unit, it is called an integrated test set. Traditionally, an integrated test set is usually called an OLTS. [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-198&amp; GR-198], ''Generic Requirements for Hand-Held Stabilized Light Sources, Optical Power Meters, Reflectance Meters, and Optical Loss Test Sets'', discusses OLTS equipment in depth.
#An ''Optical Time Domain Reflectometer ([[OTDR]])'' can be used to measure optical link loss if its markers are set at the terminus points for which the fiber loss is desired. However a single-direction measurement may not be accurate if there are multiple fibers in a link, since the back-scatter coefficient is variable between fibers. The accuracy of such a measurement can be increased if the measurement is made as a bidirectional average of the fiber. [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-196&amp; GR-196,] ''Generic Requirements for Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) Type Equipment'', discusses OTDR equipment in depth.

== Sensors ==

The major [[semiconductor]] [[sensor]] types are [[Silicon]] (Si), [[Germanium]] (Ge) and [[Indium]] [[Gallium Arsenide]] (InGaAs). Additionally, these may be used with attenuating elements for high optical power testing, or wavelength selective elements so they only respond to particular wavelengths. These all operate in a similar type of [[Electronic circuit|circuit]], however in addition to their basic wavelength response characteristics, each one has some other particular characteristics:
* Si detectors tend to [[saturation current|saturate]] at relatively low power levels, and they are only useful in the visible and 850&amp;nbsp;nm bands.
* Ge detectors saturate at the highest power levels, but have poor low power performance, poor general linearity over the entire power range, and are generally temperature sensitive. They are only marginally accurate for "1550 nm" testing, due to a combination of temperature and wavelength affecting responsivity at e.g. 1580&amp;nbsp;nm, however they provide useful performance over the commonly used 850 / 1300 / 1550&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength bands, so they are extensively deployed where lower accuracy is acceptable. Other limitations include: non-linearity at low power levels, and poor responsivity uniformity across the detector area.
* InGaAs detectors saturate at intermediate levels. They offer generally good performance, but are often very wavelength sensitive around 850&amp;nbsp;nm. So they are largely used for singlemode fiber testing at 1270 - 1650&amp;nbsp;nm.

An important part of an optical power meter sensor, is the fiber optic connector interface. Careful optical design is required to avoid significant accuracy problems when used with the wide variety of fiber types and connectors typically encountered.

Another important component, is the sensor input amplifier. This needs very careful design to avoid significant performance degradation over a wide range of conditions.

==Power measuring range==
A typical OPM measures accurately under most conditions from about 0 dBm (1 milli Watt) to about -50 dBm (10 nano Watt), although the display range may be larger. Above 0 dBm is considered "high power", and specially adapted units may measure up to nearly + 30 dBm ( 1 Watt). Below -50 dBm is "low power", and specially adapted units may measure as low as -110 dBm. Irrespective of power meter specifications, testing below about -50 dBm tends to be sensitive to stray ambient light leaking into fibers or connectors. So when testing at "low power", some sort of test range / linearity verification (easily done with attenuators) is advisable. At low power levels, optical signal measurements tend to become noisy, so meters may become very slow due to use of a significant amount of signal averaging.

To calculate dBm from power meter output :
The linear-to-dBm calculation method is:
dBm = 10 log ( P1 / P2 )
where P1 = measured power level ( e.g. in mWatts )
           P2 = reference power level, which is 1&amp;nbsp;mW

==Calibration and accuracy==
Optical Power Meter [[calibration]] and accuracy is a contentious issue. The accuracy of most primary reference standards (e.g.  [[Weight]], [[Time]], Length, [[Volt]] etc.) is known to a high accuracy, typically of the order of 1 part in a billion. However the optical power standards maintained by NIST, are only defined to about one part in a thousand. By the time this accuracy has been further degraded through successive links, instrument calibration accuracy is usually only a few %. The most accurate field optical power meters claim 1% calibration accuracy. Comparatively, this is orders of magnitude less accurate than a typical electrical voltmeter.

Further, the in-use accuracy achieved is usually significantly lower than the claimed calibration accuracy, by the time additional factors are taken into account. In typical field applications,  factors may include: ambient temperature, optical connector type, wavelength variations, [[linearity]] variations, beam [[geometry]] variations, detector saturation.

Therefore, achieving a good level of practical instrument accuracy and linearity is something that requires considerable design skill, and care in manufacturing.

==Extended sensitivity meters==
A class of laboratory power meters has an extended sensitivity, of the order of -110 dBm. This is achieved by using a very small detector and lens combination, and also a mechanical light chopper at typically 270&amp;nbsp;Hz, so the meter actually measures AC light. This eliminates unavoidable dc electrical drift effects. If the light chopping is synchronized with an appropriate synchronous (or "lock-in") amplifier, further sensitivity gains are achieved. In practice, such instruments usually achieve lower absolute accuracy due to the small detector diode, and for the same reason, may only be accurate when coupled with singlemode fiber. Occasionally such an instrument may have a cooled detector, though with the modern abandonment of Germanium sensors, and the introduction of InGaAs sensors, this is now increasingly uncommon.

==Pulse power measurement==
Optical power meters usually display time averaged power. So for pulse measurements, the signal duty cycle must be known to calculate the peak power value. However, the instantaneous peak power must be less than the maximum meter reading, or the detector may saturate, resulting in a wrong average readings. Also, at low pulse repetition rates, some meters with data or tone detection may produce improper or no readings.
A class of "high power" meters has some type of optical attenuating element in front of the detector, typically allowing about a 20&amp;nbsp;dB increase in maximum power reading. Above this level, an entirely different class of "laser power meter" instrument is used, usually based on thermal detection.

==Common fiber optic test applications==
* Measuring the absolute power in a fiber optic signal. For this application, the power meter needs to be properly calibrated at the wavelength being tested, and set to this wavelength.
* Measuring the optical loss in a fiber, in combination with a suitable stable light source. Since this is a relative test, accurate calibration is not a particular requirement, unless two or more meters are being used due to distance issues. If a more complex two-way loss test is performed, then power meter calibration can be ignored, even when two meters are used.
* Some instruments are equipped for optical test tone detection, to assist in quick cable continuity testing. Standard test tones are usually 270&amp;nbsp;Hz, 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, 2&amp;nbsp;kHz. Some units can also determine one of 12 tones,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingfisher.com.au/Products/KI9600/9600.htm Ribbon Fiber Tone Tester]&lt;/ref&gt; for ribbon fiber continuity testing.

==Test automation==
Typical test automation features usually apply to loss testing applications, and include:
* The ability to set the unit to read 0&amp;nbsp;dB at a reference power level, typically the test source.
* The ability to store readings into internal memory, for subsequent recall and download to a computer.
* The ability to synchronize the wavelength with a test source, so that the meter sets to the source wavelength. This requires a specifically matched source. The simplest way of achieving this, is by recognizing a test tone, but the best way is by transfer of data. The data method has benefits that the source can send additional useful data such as nominal source power level, serial number etc.

==Wavelength-selective meters==
An increasingly common special-purpose OPM, commonly called a "PON Power Meter" is designed to hook into a live PON (Passive Optical Network) circuit, and simultaneously test the optical power in different directions and wavelengths. This unit is essentially a triple power meter, with a collection of wavelength filters and optical couplers. Proper calibration is complicated by the varying duty cycle of the measured optical signals. It may have a simple pass/ fail display, to facilitate easy use by operators with little expertise.

Wavelength sensitivity of fiber optic power meter is a problem when used a photodiode for voltage current measurement. If the temperature sensitive measurement replaces voltage-current measurement by photodiode the wavelength sensitivity of an OPM can be reduced. Thus if the photodiode is reverse biased by a constant voltage source and supplied with constant current,  when triggered by light the junction dissipates power. The temperature of the junction rises  and the temperature rise measured by thermistor is directly proportional to the Optical power. Due to constant current supply the reflection of power to photodiode is nearly zero and the transition to and fro of electrons between valance band and conduction band is stable.

This article discusses the history and development of [[oscilloscope]] technology. The modern day digital [[oscilloscope]] grew out of multiple developments of analog oscilloscopes, which in turn grew out of the older [[oscillograph]]. The oscillograph started as a hand drawn chart which was later slightly automated. This then grew into galvanometer driven recorders and photographic recorders. Eventually, the cathode ray tube came along and displaced the oscillograph, eventually taking over the majority of the market when advancements such as triggers were added to them. With the lowering costs of digital circuitry, the digital oscilloscope has taken over the majority of the modern oscilloscope sales, with almost no makers offering analog cathode ray tube oscilloscopes. However, the oscillograph lives on to a degree in pen chart recorders for electrical signals.

== Hand-drawn oscillograms ==
[[File:Oscillograph Joubert's Step-by-Step Method.png|thumb|250px|Illustration of Joubert's step-by-step method of hand-plotting waveform measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hawkins|1917|p=1844}} Fig. 2589&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The earliest method of creating an image of a waveform was through a laborious and painstaking process of measuring the voltage or current of a spinning rotor at specific points around the axis of the rotor, and noting the measurements taken with a [[galvanometer]]. By slowly advancing around the rotor, a general standing wave can be drawn on graphing paper by recording the degrees of rotation and the meter strength at each position.

This process was first partially automated by [[Jules François Joubert]] with his ''step-by-step'' method of wave form measurement. This consisted of a special single-contact [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] attached to the shaft of a spinning rotor. The contact point could be moved around the rotor following a precise degree indicator scale and the output appearing on a galvanometer, to be hand-graphed by the technician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hawkins|1917|pp=1841–1846}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process could only produce a very rough waveform approximation since it was formed over a period of several thousand wave cycles, but it was the first step in the science of waveform imaging.

|}

The first automated oscillographs used a galvanometer to move a pen across a scroll or drum of paper, capturing wave patterns onto a continuously moving scroll. Due to the relatively high-frequency speed of the waveforms compared to the slow reaction time of the mechanical components, the waveform image was not drawn directly but instead built up over a period of time by combining small pieces of many different waveforms, to create an averaged shape.

The device known as the Hospitalier Ondograph was based on this method of wave form measurement. It automatically charged a capacitor from each 100th wave, and discharged the stored energy through a recording galvanometer, with each successive charge of the capacitor being taken from a point a little farther along the wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hawkins|1917|pp=1849–1851}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Such wave-form measurements were still averaged over many hundreds of wave cycles but were more accurate than hand-drawn oscillograms.)

In order to permit direct measurement of waveforms it was necessary for the recording device to use a very low-mass measurement system that can move with sufficient speed to match the motion of the actual waves being measured. This was done with the development of the ''moving-coil oscillograph'' by [[William Duddell]] which in modern times is also referred to as a [[mirror galvanometer]]. This reduced the measurement device to a small mirror that could move at high speeds to match the waveform.

To perform a waveform measurement, a photographic slide would be dropped past a window where the light beam emerges, or a continuous roll of motion picture film would be scrolled across the aperture to record the waveform over time. Although the measurements were much more precise than the built-up paper recorders, there was still room for improvement due to having to develop the exposed images before they could be examined.

== A tiny tilting mirror ==
In the 1920s, a tiny tilting mirror attached to a diaphragm at the apex of a horn provided good response up to a few kHz, perhaps even 10&amp;nbsp;kHz. A time base, unsynchronized, was provided by a spinning mirror polygon, and a collimated beam of light from an arc lamp projected the waveform onto the lab wall or a screen.
&lt;!-- ref.: _The Science of Musical Sounds_, by Dayton Clarence Miller, published about 1924 --&gt;

Even earlier, audio applied to a diaphragm on the gas feed to a flame made the flame height vary, and a spinning mirror polygon gave an early glimpse of waveforms. &lt;!-- Late 1800s, possibly? Ganot's Physics, a very popular 19th-C physics text? IIrc, Miller also described this. --&gt;

Moving-paper oscillographs using UV-sensitive paper and advanced mirror galvanometers provided multi-channel recordings in the mid-20th century. Frequency response was into at least the low audio range.

== CRT invention ==
[[Image:CRT oscilloscope.png|thumb|400px|The interior of a [[cathode-ray tube]] for use in an oscilloscope. '''1.''' Deflection voltage electrode; '''2.''' Electron gun; '''3.''' Electron beam; '''4.''' Focusing coil; '''5.''' Phosphor-coated inner side of the screen]]
[[Cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs) were developed in the late 19th century. At that time, the tubes were intended primarily to demonstrate and explore the physics of [[electrons]] (then known as [[cathode ray]]s). [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] invented the CRT oscilloscope as a physics curiosity in 1897, by applying an oscillating signal to electrically charged deflector plates in a [[phosphor]]-coated CRT. Braun tubes were laboratory apparatus, using a cold-cathode emitter and very high voltages (on the order of 20,000 to 30,000 volts). With only vertical deflection applied to the internal plates, the face of the tube was observed through a rotating mirror to provide a horizontal time base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Abramson|1995|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 [[Jonathan Zenneck]] equipped the cathode ray tube with beam-forming plates and used a magnetic field for sweeping the trace.&lt;ref name="kul03"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kularatna | first1 = Nihal | title = Digital and analogue instrumentation: testing and measurement | chapter = Chapter 5: Fundamentals of Oscilloscopes | publisher = Institution of Engineering and Technology | year = 2003 | page = 165 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ac5iYqHCcucC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-01-19 | isbn = 978-0-85296-999-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early cathode ray tubes had been applied experimentally to laboratory measurements as early as 1919 &lt;ref name=Burns98&gt;{{Harvtxt|Burns|1998|pp=346–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but suffered from poor stability of the vacuum and the cathode emitters. The application of a [[Thermionic emission|thermionic]] emitter allowed operating voltage to be dropped to a few hundred volts. [[Western Electric]] introduced a commercial tube of this type, which relied on a small amount of gas within the tube to assist in focussing the electron beam.&lt;ref name=Burns98/&gt;

[[Vladimir K. Zworykin|V. K. Zworykin]] described a permanently sealed, high-vacuum cathode ray tube with a thermionic emitter in 1931. This stable and reproducible component allowed [[General Radio]] to manufacture an oscilloscope that was usable outside a laboratory setting.&lt;ref name="kul03"/&gt;

The first dual-beam oscilloscope was developed in the late 1930s by the British company [[A.C.Cossor]] (later acquired by [[Raytheon]]). The CRT was not a true double beam type but used a split beam made by placing a third plate between the vertical deflection plates. It was widely used during WWII for the development and servicing of [[radar]] equipment. Although extremely useful for examining the performance of pulse circuits it was not calibrated so could not be used as a measuring device. It was, however, useful in producing response curves of IF circuits and consequently a great aid in their accurate alignment.

Allen B. Du Mont Labs. made moving-film cameras, in which continuous film motion provided the time base. Horizontal deflection was probably disabled, although a very slow sweep would have spread phosphor wear. CRTs with P11 phosphor were either standard or available.&lt;!-- ref.: Oscilloscope catalog, Allen B. DuMont Labs, possibly 1949. --&gt;

Long-persistence CRTs, sometimes used in oscilloscopes for displaying slowly changing signals or single-shot events, used a phosphor such as P7, which comprised a double layer. The inner layer fluoresced bright blue from the electron beam, and its light excited a phosphorescent "outer" layer, directly visible inside the envelope (bulb). The latter stored the light, and released it with a yellowish glow with decaying brightness over tens of seconds. This type of phosphor was also used in radar analog PPI CRT displays, which are a graphic decoration (rotating radial light bar) in some TV weather-report scenes.

== Sweep circuit ==
The technology for the horizontal sweep, that portion of the oscilloscope that creates the horizontal time axis, has changed.

===Synchronized sweep===
[[File:Heathkit Oscilloscope OM-2.jpg|thumb|Oscilloscope with synchronized sweep. "HOR. SELECTOR" sets horizontal frequency range (the capacitor); "FREQ. VERNIER" adjusts the free-running frequency; "SYNC. AMPLITUDE" sets the gain to the comparator.]]
Early oscilloscopes used a synchronized sawtooth waveform generator to provide the time axis.  The sawtooth would be made by charging a capacitor with a relatively constant current; that would create a rising voltage.  The rising voltage would be fed to the horizontal deflection plates to create the sweep.  The rising voltage would also be fed to a comparator; when the capacitor reached a certain level, the capacitor would be discharged, the trace would return to the left, and the capacitor (and the sweep) would start another traverse.  The operator would adjust the charging current so the sawtooth generator would have a slightly longer period than a multiple of the vertical axis signal.  For example, when looking at a 1&amp;nbsp;kHz sinewave (1&amp;nbsp;ms period), the operator might adjust the horizontal frequency to a little bit more than 5&amp;nbsp;ms. When the input signal was absent, the sweep would free run at that frequency.

If the input signal were present, the resulting display would not be stable at the horizontal sweep's free-running frequency because it was not a submultiple of the input (vertical axis) signal. To fix that, the sweep generator would be synchronized by adding a scaled version of the input the signal to the sweep generator's comparator. The added signal would cause the comparator to trip a little earlier and thus synchronize it to the input signal. The operator could adjust the synch level; for some designs, the operator could choose the polarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |publisher=Knight Electronics Corporation |location=Maywood, IL |year=1965 |title=Operator's Manual: Model KG-635 DC to 5.2 MC 5" Wideband Oscilloscope |page=3 |quote=Synchronization ... + internal, − internal, 60 cps, and external. Sync limiting provides semi-automatic operation with level control.  Locks from waveform fundamentals up to 5 mc. Will sync on display amplitudes as low as 0.1 [inch]}}  The KG-635 sync amplifier used a 12AT7 differential amplifier (V5). (id p. 15.)  Sync level control would bias the amplifier into cutoff so action would only occur near the end of the sweep; the sync output was a negative pulse to the sweep generator; a diode pulse limiter clamped the sync pulse. (id p. 18.)&lt;/ref&gt;  The sweep generator would turn off (known as blanking) the beam during retrace.&lt;ref&gt;KG-635 p. 18 stating, "Retrace blanking is obtained from the plate of V-6A and applied to the cathode of the CRT."&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting horizontal sweep speed was uncalibrated because the sweep rate was adjusted by changing slope of the sawtooth generator. The time per division on the display depended upon the sweep's free-running frequency and a horizontal gain control.

A synchronized sweep oscilloscope could not display a non-periodic signal because it could not synchronize the sweep generator to that signal. Horizontal circuits were often AC-coupled

===Triggered sweep ===
During World War II, a few oscilloscopes used for radar development (and a few laboratory oscilloscopes) had so-called driven sweeps. These sweep circuits remained dormant, with the CRT beam cut off, until a drive pulse from an external device unblanked the CRT and started a constant-speed horizontal trace; the calibrated speed permitted measurement of time intervals. When the sweep was complete, the sweep circuit blanked the CRT (turned off the beam), reset itself, and waited for the next drive pulse. The Dumont 248, a commercially available oscilloscope produced in 1945, had this feature.

Oscilloscopes became a much more useful tool in 1946 when [[Howard Vollum]] and [[Melvin Jack Murdock]] introduced the Tektronix Model 511 ''triggered-sweep'' oscilloscope. Howard Vollum had first seen this technology in use in Germany. The triggered sweep has a circuit that develops the driven sweep's drive pulse from the input signal.

Triggering allows stationary display of a repeating waveform, as multiple repetitions of the waveform are drawn over exactly the same trace on the phosphor screen. A triggered sweep maintains the calibration of sweep speed, making it possible to measure properties of the waveform such as frequency, phase, rise time, and others, that would not otherwise be possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spitzer|Howarth|1972|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, triggering can occur at varying intervals, so there is no requirement that the input signal be periodic.
[[File:Triggered Sweep Controls on Tektronix 465 Oscilloscope.jpg|thumb|Triggered sweep controls on a Tektronix 465 oscilloscope]]
Triggered-sweep oscilloscopes compare the vertical deflection signal (or rate of change of the signal) with an adjustable threshold, referred to as trigger level. As well, the trigger circuits also recognize the slope direction of the vertical signal when it crosses the threshold—whether the vertical signal is positive-going or negative-going at the crossing. This is called trigger polarity. When the vertical signal crosses the set trigger level and in the desired direction, the trigger circuit unblanks the CRT and starts an accurate linear sweep. After the completion of the horizontal sweep, the next sweep will occur when the signal once again crosses the threshold trigger.

Variations in triggered-sweep oscilloscopes include models offered with CRTs using long-persistence [[Phosphor|phosphors]], such as type P7. These oscilloscopes were used for applications where the horizontal trace speed was very slow, or there was a long delay between sweeps, to provide a persistent screen image. Oscilloscopes without triggered sweep could also be retro-fitted with triggered sweep using a solid-state circuit developed by [[Harry Garland]] and [[Roger Melen]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | journal = Popular Electronics| title = Add Triggered Sweep to your Scope | last1 = Garland | first1 = Harry  | last2 = Melen | first2 = Roger | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–66 | year = 1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As oscilloscopes have become more powerful over time, enhanced triggering options allow capture and display of more complex waveforms. For example, ''[[trigger holdoff]]'' is a feature in most modern oscilloscopes that can be used to define a certain period following a trigger during which the oscilloscope will not trigger again. This makes it easier to establish a stable view of a waveform with multiple edges which would otherwise cause another trigger. &lt;!-- duplicated details in this paragraph; I'll try to fix this, but feel free to remind me! -- Nikevich--&gt;

== Tektronix ==
[[Image:Tektronix 465 Oscilloscope.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Type 465 [[Tektronix]] oscilloscope, a popular analog oscilloscope during the 1980s]]
Vollum and Murdock went on to found [[Tektronix]], the first manufacturer of calibrated oscilloscopes (which included a [[Oscilloscope#Graticule|graticule]] on the screen and produced plots with calibrated scales on the [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]] of the screen).{{cn|date=January 2016}} Later developments by Tektronix included the development of multiple-trace oscilloscopes for comparing signals either by time-[[multiplexing]] (via chopping or trace alternation) or by the presence of multiple [[electron gun]]s in the tube. In 1963, Tektronix introduced the [[DVBST|Direct View Bistable Storage Tube (DVBST)]], which allowed observing single pulse waveforms rather than (as previously) only repeating wave forms. Using [[micro-channel plate]]s, a variety of secondary-emission electron multiplier inside the CRT and behind the faceplate, the most advanced analog oscilloscopes (for example, the Tek 7104 mainframe) could display a visible trace (or allow the photography) of a single-shot event even when running at extremely fast sweep speeds. This oscilloscope went to 1&amp;nbsp;GHz.

In vacuum-tube oscilloscopes made by Tektronix, the vertical amplifier's delay line was a long frame, L-shaped for space reasons, that carried several dozen discrete inductors and a corresponding number of low-capacitance adjustable ("trimmer") cylindrical capacitors. These oscilloscopes had plug-in vertical input channels. For adjusting the delay line capacitors, a high-pressure gas-filled mercury-wetted reed switch created extremely fast-rise pulses which went directly to the later stages of the vertical amplifier. With a fast sweep, any misadjustment created a dip or bump, and touching a capacitor made its local part of the waveform change. Adjusting the capacitor made its bump disappear. Eventually, a flat top resulted.

Vacuum-tube output stages in early wideband oscilloscopes used radio transmitting tubes, but they consumed a lot of power. Picofarads of capacitance to ground limited bandwidth. A better design, called a distributed amplifier, used multiple tubes, but their inputs (control grids) were connected along a tapped L-C delay line, so the tubes' input capacitances became part of the delay line. As well, their outputs (plates/anodes) were likewise connected to another tapped delay line, its output feeding the deflection plates. (This amplifier was push-pull, so there were four delay lines, two for input, and two for output.)

[[File:Handheld Oscilloscope SHS800.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A modern Siglent SHS800 handheld digital storage oscilloscope (DSO) using an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] for its display]]
The first [[Digital Storage Oscilloscope]] (DSO) was invented by [[Nicolet Test Instrument]] of Madison, Wisconsin.{{cn|date=October 2014}}  It was a low speed ADC (1 MHz, 12 bit) used primarily for vibration and medical analysis.{{cn|date=October 2014}}  The first high speed DSO (100 MHz, 8 bit) was invented by [[Walter LeCroy]] (who founded the [[LeCroy Corporation]], based in New York, USA) after producing high-speed digitizers for the research center [[CERN]] in Switzerland. LeCroy (since 2012 Teledyne LeCroy) remains one of the three largest manufacturers of oscilloscopes in the world.

Starting in the 1980s, [[digital electronics|digital]] oscilloscopes became prevalent. Digital storage oscilloscopes use a fast [[analog-to-digital converter]] and memory chips to record and show a digital representation of a waveform, yielding much more flexibility for triggering, analysis, and display than is possible with a classic analog oscilloscope. Unlike its analog predecessor, the digital storage oscilloscope can show pre-trigger events, opening another dimension to the recording of rare or intermittent events and [[troubleshooting]] of electronic [[glitch]]es. As of 2006 most new oscilloscopes (aside from education and a few niche markets) are digital.

Digital scopes rely on effective use of the installed memory and trigger functions: not enough memory and the user will miss the events they want to examine; if the scope has a large memory but does not trigger as desired, the user will have difficulty finding the event.

DSOs also led to the creation of hand-held digital oscilloscopes (pictured), useful for many test and field service applications. A hand held oscilloscope is usually a digital sampling oscilloscope, using a [[liquid crystal display]] for its display.

Due to the recent rise in the prevalence of PCs, PC-based oscilloscopes have been becoming more common. Typically, a signal will be captured on external hardware (which includes an [[analog-to-digital converter]] and memory) and transmitted to the computer, where it is processed and displayed.

The introduction and early development of [[printing]] in [[South India]] is attributed to [[missionary]] propaganda and the endeavours of the [[British East India Company]]. Among the pioneers in this arena, maximum attention is claimed by the [[Jesuit missionaries]], followed by the [[Protestant]] Fathers and Hindu [[Pandits]]. Once the immigrants realized the importance of the local language, they began to disseminate their religious teachings through that medium, in effect ushering in the vernacular print culture in India. The first [[Tamil language|Tamil]] booklet was printed in 1554 (February 11) in [[Lisbon]] - ''Cartilha em lingoa Tamul e Portugues'' in Romanized Tamil script by Vincente de Nazareth, Jorge Carvalho and Thoma da Cruz, all from the [[Paravar]] community of [[Tuticorin]]. it is also the first non-European language to find space in the modern printing culture in the world.

These developments took place at a time when other locations such as [[Madurai]] were still confined to the use of copper plates and stone inscriptions. This book was printed earlier than the first printed and dated books of Russia (1563), Africa (1624) and Greece (1821).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2010/04/14/first_tamil_book/ Karka...Nirka...]'' Blog on Tamil Literature&lt;/ref&gt;

== Henriques and the sixteenth century ==
[[File:DOCTRINA CHRISTAM IMAGE.jpg|thumbnail|right| Doctrina Christam - Kirisithiyaani Vanakkam.1579 AD]]
The appearance of Tamil in print, both in Roman transliteration and in its native script was the result of the convergence between [[Colonialism|colonial]] expansion and local politics, coupled with the efforts of a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] Jesuit, [[Henrique Henriques]] who arrived on the Fishery Coast (Tuticorin) in 1547. During his stay Henriques produced five different books in the Tamil script and language, printed at various [[Jesuit]] settlements on the west coast. He also compiled a Tamil Grammar and a Tamil Dictionary, which, though never printed, were widely used by other Europeans. Graham Shaw speaks of Henriques as, “the first great European Scholar of any Indian language" ([[Stuart Blackburn]]).

Around 1575 Henriques was relieved of his missionary duties on the east coast and moved to [[Goa]] where he began to prepare his texts. Henriques was there assisted by Father Pero Luis, who entered the Jesuit order in 1562. The stage was finally set when Tamil types were cast in Goa by João Gonçalves (perfected by Father João de Faria in [[Kollam]]), with the assistance of Luis.

In 1577 the first of the Henriques’ five books, ''[[Thambiran Vanakkam|Doctrina Christam en Lingua Malauar Tamul (Thambiran Vanakkam)]]'' was printed in Goa. The book was the first book printed with Indian type. Although some scholars refuse to consider this as a historical fact, Graham Shaw seems convinced that it was printed. The second printed Tamil book was only 16 pages long, but a third Catechism of 127 pages, a Tamil translation of the popular Portuguese text by Marcos Jorge, was printed again with new type in [[Cochin]] on November 14, 1579. Three Catechisms were printed with three sets of type, at three different locations on the west coast over the following three years. Henriques’ two other books printed at Cochin were:

# A Confessionary (''Confessionairo'') 1580 (214 pages)
# Lives of Saints (''[[Flos Sanctorum]]''), 1586 (669 pages)

== Roberto De Nobili and the seventeenth century ==
In the 17th century, Tamil books were printed at [[Ambalakad]] with type made in Rome. Only five in number and printed within a space of two years, these books might be called the second phase of Tamil printing.  There were five books but only two texts. The first was [[Roberto De Nobili]]’s Catechism, ''Nanopatecam'', printed posthumously in three volumes: Volume 1 in 1677 followed by Volumes 2 and 3 in 1678. The second text was Antem De Proenca’s ''Tamil-Portuguese Dictionary'' of 1679.

Unlike Henriques, [[Roberto de Nobili]] did not translate a Portuguese text into Tamil, instead he wrote his own manual, so that he might emphasize the hidden truths of the new faith.

== Ziegenbalg and printing in Tranquebar ==
[[Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg]] was the pioneer in the setup of a [[printing press]] at Madras. In South India the printing press had been established as early as 1578, but printing activities came to an end owing to a gradual decline in the religious zeal of successive generations of missionaries. Tamil printing stopped after 1612, as the numerous writings of Nobili and Manoel Martin lay unpublished in 1649 and 1660. There were some attempts to revive printing, but they proved short-lived. For instance, there is a reference to a Latin–Tamil grammar by Father Beschi, a Sanskrit scholar, having been printed at Ziegenbalg’s press.

Ziegenbalg explained in a number of letters that the books prepared in the Malabar language, to help in the propagation of the [[Christian]] faith, were initially written in Portuguese and then translated into the “Malabarick Language” with the help of Indian assistants. In the absence of a printing press the books that had been prepared up until then had to be transcribed by hand. This proved to be a slow, laborious and expensive process. With the objective of facilitating a wider and faster dissemination of Christian literature, Ziegenbalg in his letter of August 22, 1708, put forth a demand for a “Malabarick and Portuguese printing press”.&lt;ref&gt;A.K. Priolkar&lt;/ref&gt; In the mean time Ziegenbalg devoted considerable attention to collecting [[manuscripts]] of Indian literature, as this would help him to understand the old beliefs of the Hindus which he proposed to refute.

In a letter written in 1708, Ziegenbalg speaks of 26 [[sermons]] delivered by him at the church of [[Tranquebar]] and two vocabularies of Malabar language prepared by him. The first consisted of 26,000 words in common use, and had three columns, the first giving the word in Malabar characters, the second its [[transliteration]] and the third its meaning in [[German language|German]]. The second contained words used in poetry. For this work Ziegenbalg was assisted by Indian scholars and poets who remained at his house for four months.

Ziegenbalg was keenly aware that to attain his object he needed a printing press. He made repeated demands for a press in his letters of April–June 1709. The [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]], set up in the 1690s, came forward to help under the recommendation of the Rev. A. W. Boehme (the German chaplain to [[Prince George of Denmark]]). In 1711 the society sent the mission some copies of the Bible in Portuguese as well as a printing press with [[pica types]] and other accessories along with a printer to operate it. The ship was held up by the French near [[Brazil]], and the printer Jones Finck was arrested but later released. Finck soon succumbed to fever near the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The printing press reached India in 1712 unaccompanied by its operator. The press, however, started functioning with the help of a German printer–cum–compositor.

Malabar characters were obtained from Europe. A letter dated April 7, 1713, contains a list of 32 books in the Malabar language, original works as well as translations, and 22 books in Portuguese prepared by the missionaries. It is stated that the books in the Malabar language included a vocabulary written on paper and another written on [[palm leaves]].

According to a letter of January 3, 1714, the work of printing the [[New Testament]] in Tamil had already begun. Another letter of September 27, 1714, states that, "The [[Four Evangelists]] and Acts of the [[Apostles]]" was already printed. Reportedly, this is the oldest Tamil book printed at Tranquebar, a copy of which is available at the [[Serampore]] College Library. From 1715 onwards with the completion of the New Testament, printing activity in Tamil commenced in full swing. In 1715 Ziegenbalg wrote a concise grammar of the Malabar language for use by Europeans and had it printed by 1716. A copy of this book also exists at the Serampore College Library.
Ziegenbalg and his collaborators aimed at spreading their printed work all over India. Consequently, their marketing strategies cajoled them to produce [[almanacs]] which were quite scarce in the country. A ''Sheet Almanac'' was printed and sold on the coast of [[Coromandel Coast|Coromandel]] as well as in Malabar and Bengal.

== Constanzo G. Beschi ==
[[File:Tamil bible Printed 1715.jpg|thumb|[[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Bible]] Printed in 1715 at [[Tharangambadi]]]]
Parallel to printing efforts by the Protestant missionaries at [[Tranquebar]] or Tarangampãdi, the growth of the Jesuit missionary  [[Constanzo Beschi]] (Viramãmunivar; Constantine Joseph Beschi 1680–1747) was equally significant in revolutionizing the face of Tamil print and literature. The difference in the Christian beliefs of the respective cults gave rise to rigorous disputes and theological debates, which on many occasions even led to violent conflicts resulting in injuries and death. These disputes were carried on by the Lutherans through “printed books and pamphlets",&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Blackburn (2006), Page 45&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Beschi (due to lack of a Jesuit-owned printing press) mainly concentrated on writing influential pieces of literature. Although printing in Tamil was introduced by the Jesuits, by the eighteenth century the scenario had changed and the domain of the press came to be  majority controlled and cultivated by the Protestants. Beschi's efforts in a place populated with thousands of [[Lutheran]] converts (mainly [[Tanjore]] and [[Travancore]]), grew to become an “alarming”, “arrogant” and “formidable” rival to the already sprawling missionary activities of the Protestant fathers. One particular reason for Beschi’s popularity was, as Blackburn observes, his “Romanish compromises with local customs”. In the books of Muttusami Pillai (Beschi’s Tamil biographer), he is frequently portrayed as a traditional Eastern or [[Oriental]] king, adorned with ornate jewellery and chandan on his forehead.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Blackburn (2006), Page 48&lt;/ref&gt; Beschi was reportedly favoured by the local rulers, especially Chanda Sahib whom he had served diwan to, thereby making it easier for him to master the language. He was intelligent enough to adopt such means which would undoubtedly benefit him in ways more than one.

Contrary to this image, Beschi has also been examined as a magical Indian “poet-saint” with extraordinary literary skills and persuasion prowess. Beschi’s written works constituted the substructure of modern Tamil literary acculturation. According to sources, Beschi wrote more than twenty books :– dictionaries, [[epic poetry]], prose collections, grammar, folklore. His major prose essay was ''Veta Vilakkam'' which ran to 250 pages. The first [[bilingual]] Tamil grammar printed in India is also credited to Beschi. He composed various interlingual dictionaries: ''Tamil-Latin'', ''Latin-Tamil-Portuguese'', and ''Tamil-French'' and most importantly the four-way [[lexicon]] ''Tamil-Tamil'' ''Catur-Agarati'' which comprised meanings, synonyms, rhymes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/article226490.ece A. Raman]&lt;/ref&gt; This book was not printed before 1824. Although it cannot be assumed that his works were well accepted and appreciated by the Protestants, as Blackburn comments, the rival camp unbiasedly  “admired Beschi’s literary skills - they printed one of his grammars and another of his books (''Vetiyar Olukkam'', A Manual for Catechists) became standard reading for them by the nineteenth century…”.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Blackburn (2006),Page 49&lt;/ref&gt; Beschi’s ''Parramarta Kuruvin Kattai'' or ''Guru Simpleton'' was the first printed book of Tamil [[Folklore|folktale]].

=== Guru Simpleton ===

Beschi’s ''Guru Simpleton'' (which occupies a status similar to The Arabian Nights or The Panchatantra in Tamil culture) is a blend of the oral tradition of Tamil folklore and the European story form, wrapped in the author’s imaginative faculty. Although Beschi had completed its composition (along with a preface) by 1776, the book was not published singularly until 1822 in London. Records show that Beschi wrote the Tamil version first and later translated it into Latin. Although Beschi claimed that the sole purpose of the book was to disseminate amusement and humour among both locals and missionaries, Blackburn mentions that the author was most probably yearning for something more than that – “this was a plea for a Jesuit patron, somewhere outside India, to underwrite the publication of his dictionary and folktale”,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Blackburn (2006), Page 66&lt;/ref&gt; as print was a more reliable medium to “demonstrate correct spelling” than local [[scribes]] and copyists.

== Printed oral tales in Tamil ==
In the history of print in early nineteenth-century India there were an enormous number of books of [[oral literature]], especially folktales published. Between 1800 and 1835 most printed books in Tamil(dictionaries and grammars aside) were collections of oral tales. Well known literary texts, such as ''Tirrukkural'' and ''Nalatiyar'', also appeared in print, but these classical texts were outnumbered by books of oral tales".&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Blackburn (2004), Page 122&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was ''Vikkiramatittan'' ''Katai'', a collection of folktales in the framework of a literary tale which appeared in 1804, followed by the ''Catamuka Ravanan  Katai'' in 1808; the ''Mariyatai Raman Katai'' and ''Tamilariyum Mantai Katai'' in 1812; the ''Pururava Cakravarti Katai'' in 1819; the ''Katamantacari'', a collection of oral tales in 1820; the Tamil – English bilingual publication of ''Paramartta Kuruvin Katai'' (''Guru Simpleton'') in 1822 (in London) ; a Tamil ''Pancatantra'' in 1826 ; the ''Katacintamani'', another collection of oral tales, in 1833; and translations of tales from English, French and [[Aesop]] by the 1850s. Some of these books are still available today.

== Printing by Pundits ==
A number of early Tamil print publishing houses were set up by the pundits in the 1830s in Madras. These establishments played a significant role in the consolidation of the commercial printing world. They were also involved in public–politics, the anti–missionary movement in Georgetown, for instance. Pundits who were educated at the College Fort of St George and some who were not, used the text-making skills they learned from the Europeans in setting up of their own presses at Madras.

The rise of the pundit - presses saw growth during the 1830s with Kalvi Vilakkam, the joint venture of Charavanaperumal Aiyar and Vichakaperumal Aiyar in 1834. The press functioned till the 1850s producing more than 50 books. This was followed by the Sarasvati Press (1835) of Tiruvenkatachala Mutaliar, and Kalvi Kalanchiyam set up in 1839 by Umapati Mutaliar and his three brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Rimi B. Chaterjee&lt;/ref&gt; These presses quickly became associated with movements in deflecting the missionaries as they started voicing the sentiments of certain sections of the Hindu community.

== Arumuka Navalar ==

[[Arumuka Navalar]] spearheaded the Saivism cult both in [[Sri Lanka]] and in Tamil Nadu. He was the guardian of pure and pristine Saiva tradition. He established a number of schools for Tamil and Saivism and printing presses at [[Jaffna]], [[Chidambaram]] and [[Madras]]. He was the most fluent Tamil speaker and writer of his generation. At the age of 27, Arumugam was conferred the title of “Navalar”, the eloquent.

In the context of printing, Arumuka Navalar or Arumuga Navalar was an editor of old Tamil texts. Among his editions the most important are Mantalapurutar’s  lexicon ''cutamani nikantu'' with commentary (first printed in 1849), the standard medieval grammar ''[[Nannūl]]'' with  a commentary (1851), the early devotional poem ''[[Tirumurukāṟṟuppaṭai]]'', [[Manikkavacakar]]’s  great devotional poems ''[[Tiruvacakam]]'' and ''tirukkovaiyar'', the text of ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]]'' with [[Parimelazhagar]]’s detailed gloss in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Blackburn(2006). Page 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Arumuga Navalar apparently introduced few novel features in the area of Tamil editing. He was probably the first to use punctuation marks like the semicolon, the question mark and the exclamation mark. He produced the first “split” complex sandhi forms to facilitate reading and comprehension.

== Madras School Book Society ==

The [[Calcutta School-Book Society]] was established under the patronage of the [[Marquis of Hastings]] in 1817. Soon after a similar society was set up in Madras. The association in South India soon languished, and for many years it virtually ceased to exist. It was revived around 1850, when prizes were offered for the best school book on specified subjects. Several new publications were thus secured of which, The History of India by H. Morris Esq., was very successful.

The publications of the Madras School Book Society being chiefly used in Government Schools such that religious sentiments were adapted accordingly. The committee of the Madras Tract Society issued some books with Christian elements intended specially for mission schools&lt;ref&gt;John Murdoch, 1865&lt;/ref&gt; Classified catalogue of Tamil printed books,with introductory notices. Though reading books of the Madras School Book society were prepared with special reference to the government schools, the committee was not restricted to non–Christian publications. The Rev. A.R. Symonds suggested that the society should make an effort to provide wholesome and attractive literature. Prizes were also offered for the best translation of  [[Robinson Crusoe]].

== Printing in Sri Lanka==

== Vepery Press ==
[[File:Katexizis.jpg|thumbnail|right|Catechism book printed in Pondicherry Mission Press. 1841 A.D]]
Madras was the foremost seat of printing among the “colonial metropolises”. The [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]] (SPCK) was set up at Vepery (situated just outside Madras) in 1726 by Benjamin Schultz. This new venture (Vepery mission) was just an extension of the Tranquebar mission. Earlier in 1712, a printing press enabled with Tamil and Telegu typefaces was provided by the SPCK for publishing activities at Tranquebar, on repeated appeals by Ziegenbalg. This press mostly dealt with smaller publications like ''A General Description Of Malabar Heathendom'', ''Four Gospels And Acts'', and ''Accursed Heathendom'' which were usually antagonistic to Hindu beliefs and principles. It also printed the translated version of the New Testament in 1715. When the English army under Sir Eyre Coote attacked the French colony of  Pondicherry in 1761 they seized the printing press from the governor’s house along with its typefaces (which were a “prize catch” for them &lt;ref&gt;J.B. Prashant More, Page 80&lt;/ref&gt;) and the printer, Delon and transferred it to Madras. Nonetheless [[Johann Phillip Fabricius]], a well-known Tamil scholar convinced Coote to hand over the press, only on agreement that the printing demands of [[Fort St. George]] would be given maximum importance. In 1762 itself, the SPCK press published a calendar and several Tamil books, “pre-dating the books printed in Calcutta and Bombay at least by a decade”.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Blackburn(2006) Page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1766, Vepery got its own press supplemented with its own print equipment. Therefore, the presses confiscated from [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] were returned to Fort St George, which led to the establishment of the Government Press in Mount Road. The Vepery Press was renamed as the SPCK Press; [[Johann Philipp Fabricius]] being its managerial head, who composed and printed a Tamil book on Catechism (1766) with typefaces cut in Germany ([[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]). By the next decade typecases were produced by the SPCK Press itself and they lasted until the 1870s. Books printed included Fabricius’s ''Translation of the New Testament'' (1772); his ''Dictionary of Tamil and English'', based on Ziegenbalg’s ''Malabar English Dictionary''(1779) which came out 100 years after Antão da Proença’s ''Tamil-Portuguese Dictionary'' of 1679; and ''Oru Paratecyin Punyacaritram'' (a translation of Bunyan’s ''[[Pilgrims Progress]]'' (1793). This press was sold to the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] (the American Board Mission or ABM) in Çintadaripet in the mid 19th century. When the ABM left India in 1886 the press was reacquired by the SPCK–Diocesan committee and renamed the Diocesan Press that still exists today, almost 250 years later, as the CLS Press.&lt;ref&gt;A.

In [[computer science]], '''priority inversion''' is a scenario in [[scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] in which a high priority [[task (computing)|task]] is indirectly [[preemption (computing)|preempted]] by a lower priority task effectively inverting the relative priorities of the two tasks.

This violates the priority model that high priority tasks can only be prevented from running by higher priority tasks and briefly by low priority tasks which will quickly complete their use of a resource shared by the high and low priority tasks.

==Example of a priority inversion==
Consider two tasks ''H'' and ''L'', of high and low priority respectively, either of which can acquire exclusive use of a shared resource ''R''. If ''H'' attempts to acquire ''R'' after ''L'' has acquired it, then ''H'' becomes blocked until ''L'' relinquishes the resource. Sharing an exclusive-use resource (''R'' in this case) in a well-designed system typically involves ''L'' relinquishing ''R'' promptly so that ''H'' (a higher priority task) does not stay blocked for excessive periods of time. Despite good design, however, it is possible that a third task ''M'' of medium priority (p(''L'') &lt; p(''M'') &lt; p(''H''), where p(''x'') represents the priority for task (''x'')) becomes runnable during ''L''&amp;apos;s use of ''R''. At this point, ''M'' being higher in priority than ''L'', preempts ''L'' (since ''M'' does not depend on ''R''), causing ''L'' to not be able to relinquish ''R'' promptly, in turn causing ''H''—the highest priority process—to be unable to run (that is, ''H'' suffers unexpected blockade indirectly caused by lower priority tasks like ''M'').

==Consequences==
In some cases, priority inversion can occur without causing immediate harm—the delayed execution of the high priority task goes unnoticed, and eventually the low priority task releases the shared resource. However, there are also many situations in which priority inversion can cause serious problems. If the high priority task is left [[Resource starvation|starved]] of the resources, it might lead to a system malfunction or the triggering of pre-defined corrective measures, such as a [[watchdog timer]] resetting the entire system. The trouble experienced by the Mars lander "[[Mars Pathfinder]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cs.unc.edu/~anderson/teach/comp790/papers/mars_pathfinder_long_version.html What Really Happened on Mars] by Glenn Reeves of the JPL Pathfinder team&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www3.nd.edu/~cpoellab/teaching/cse40463/slides6.pdf Explanation of priority inversion problem experienced by Mars Pathfinder]&lt;/ref&gt; is a classic example of problems caused by priority inversion in [[Real-time computing|realtime]] systems.

Priority inversion can also reduce the [[perceived performance]] of the system. Low priority tasks usually have a low priority because it is not important for them to finish promptly (for example, they might be a [[batch job]] or another non-interactive activity). Similarly, a high priority task has a high priority because it is more likely to be subject to strict time constraints—it may be providing data to an interactive user, or acting subject to realtime response guarantees. Because priority inversion results in the execution of a lower priority task blocking the high priority task, it can lead to reduced system responsiveness, or even the violation of response time guarantees.

A similar problem called [[Earliest deadline first scheduling#Deadline interchange|deadline interchange]] can occur within [[earliest deadline first scheduling]] (EDF).

==Solutions==
The existence of this problem has been known since the 1970s.  Lampson and Redell
&lt;ref name=Lampson79&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lampson|first1=B|last2=Redell|first2=D.|title=Experience with processes and monitors in MESA|journal=Communications of the ACM (CACM)|date=June 1980|volume=23|issue=2|pages=105–117|doi=10.1145/358818.358824 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published one of the first papers to point out the priority inversion problem.  Systems such as the UNIX kernel were already addressing the problem with the splx() primitive.  There is no foolproof method to predict the situation. There are however many existing solutions, of which the most common ones are:

;Disabling all interrupts to protect critical sections
:When disabling interrupts is used to prevent priority inversion, there are only two priorities: ''preemptible'', and ''interrupts disabled.''  With no third priority, inversion is impossible.  Since there's only one piece of lock data (the interrupt-enable bit), misordering locking is impossible, and so deadlocks cannot occur.  Since the critical regions always run to completion, hangs do not occur.  Note that this only works if all interrupts are disabled.  If only a particular hardware device's interrupt is disabled, priority inversion is reintroduced by the hardware's prioritization of interrupts.  In early versions of UNIX, a series of primitives named splx(0) ... splx(7) disabled all interrupts up through the given priority.  By properly choosing the highest priority of any interrupt that ever entered the critical section, the priority inversion problem could be solved without locking out all of the interrupts.  Ceilings were assigned in [[Rate-monotonic scheduling|rate-monotonic]] order, i.e. the slower devices had lower priorities.

:In multiple CPU systems, a simple variation, "single shared-flag locking" is used.  This scheme provides a single flag in shared memory that is used by all CPUs to lock all inter-processor critical sections with a [[busy-wait]].  Interprocessor communications are expensive and slow on most multiple CPU systems.  Therefore, most such systems are designed to minimize shared resources.  As a result, this scheme actually works well on many practical systems. These methods are widely used in simple [[embedded system]]s, where they are prized for their reliability, simplicity and low resource use.  These schemes also require clever programming to keep the critical sections very brief.  Many software engineers consider them impractical in general-purpose computers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

;A [[priority ceiling]]
:With priority ceilings, the shared [[mutual exclusion|mutex]] process (that runs the operating system code) has a characteristic (high) priority of its own, which is assigned to the task locking the mutex. This works well, provided the other high priority task(s) that tries to access the mutex does not have a priority higher than the ceiling priority.

;[[Priority inheritance]]
:Under the policy of priority inheritance, whenever a high priority task has to wait for some resource shared with an executing low priority task, the low priority task is temporarily assigned the priority of the highest waiting priority task for the duration of its own use of the shared resource, thus keeping medium priority tasks from pre-empting the (originally) low priority task, and thereby affecting the waiting high priority task as well. Once the resource is released, the low priority task continues at its original priority level.

;[[Random boosting]]
:Ready tasks holding locks are randomly boosted in priority until they exit the critical section.  This solution is used in [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684831(v=vs.85).aspx Priority Inversion] on [[MSDN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Avoid blocking
:Because priority inversion involves a low-priority task blocking a high-priority task, one way to avoid priority inversion is to avoid blocking, for example by using [[non-blocking synchronization]] or [[read-copy-update]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1164">In [[manufacturing engineering]], a '''product layout''' refers to a production system where the work stations and equipment are located along the line of production, as with [[assembly line]]s.

Usually, work units are moved along a line (not necessarily a [[Line (geometry)|geometric line]], but a set of interconnected work stations) by a [[conveyor]]. [[Work (project management)|Work]] is done in small amounts at each of the work stations on the line. To use the product layout, the total work to be performed must be dividable into small [[Task (project management)|tasks]] that can be assigned to each of the workstations.

Because the work stations each do small amounts of [[Work (project management)|work]], the stations utilize specific techniques and equipment tailored to the individual job they are assigned.  This can lead to a higher rate of production.

'''Reconciliation ecology''' is the branch of [[ecology]] which studies ways to encourage [[biodiversity]] in [[Human ecosystem|human-dominated]] [[ecosystem]]s. [[Michael Rosenzweig]] first articulated the concept in his book ''[[Win-Win Ecology]]'',&lt;ref name=winwin&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Michael|title=Win-win Ecology, How the Earth's species can survive in the midst of human enterprise.|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the theory that there is not enough area for all of earth’s biodiversity to be saved within designated [[nature preserve]]s. Therefore, humans should increase biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. By managing for biodiversity in ways that do not decrease human utility of the system, it is a "[[win-win]]" situation for both human use and native biodiversity. The science is based in the ecological foundation of human land-use trends and species-area relationships. It has many benefits beyond protection of biodiversity, and there are numerous examples of it around the globe. Aspects of reconciliation ecology can already be found in management legislation, but there are challenges in both public acceptance and ecological success of reconciliation attempts.

==Theoretical basis==

===Human land use trends===
{{Main|List of environmental issues}}
Traditional conservation is based on "reservation and restoration"; reservation meaning setting pristine lands aside for the sole purpose of maintaining biodiversity, and restoration meaning returning human impacted ecosystems to their natural state. However, reconciliation ecologists argue that there is too great a proportion of land already impacted by humans for these techniques to succeed.

While it is difficult to measure exactly how much land has been transformed by human use, estimates range from 39 to 50%.  This includes [[agricultural]] land, [[pasture]]land, [[urban area|urban]] areas, and heavily harvested [[forest]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vitousek|first=P. M. |author2=H. A. Mooney |author3=J. Lubchenco |author4=J. M. Melillo|title=Human Domination of Earth's Ecosystems|journal=Science|year=1997|volume=277|pages=494–499| doi=10.1126/science.277.5325.494|issue=5325}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 50% of [[arable land]] is already under cultivation.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=R. E.|author2=S. J. Cornell |author3=J. P. W. Scharlemann |author4=A.

M.|author2=J. D. Aber |author3=R. W. Howarth |author4=G. E. Likens |author5=P. A. Matson |author6=D. W. Schindler |author7=W. H. Schlesinger |author8=D. G. Tilman |title=Human alterations of the global nitrogen cycle: sources and consequences|journal=Ecological Applications|year=1997|volume=7|pages=737–750|doi=10.1890/1051-0761(1997)007[0737:haotgn]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include addition of nutrients such [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]], [[acid rain]], [[ocean acidification]], redistribution of water resources, and increased [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere. Humans have also changed species compositions of many landscapes that they do not dominate directly by introducing new species or harvesting native species. This new assemblage of species has been compared to previous mass extinctions and [[speciation]] events caused by formation of [[land bridge]]s and colliding of continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mooney|first=H. A|author2=E. E. Cleland |title=The evolutionary impact of invasive species|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2001|volume=98|pages=5446–5451|doi=10.1073/pnas.091093398|pmid=11344292|issue=10|pmc=33232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Species-area relationships===
[[File:SAR(Species-area curve).gif|250px|thumb|The species-area relationship for a contiguous habitat]]
The need for reconciliation ecology was derived from patterns of species distribution and diversity. The most relevant of these patterns is the [[species-area curve]] which states that a larger geographic area will contain higher species diversity. This relationship has been supported by so large a body of research that some scholars consider it to be an ecological law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lomolino|first=M. V.|title=Ecology's most general, yet protean pattern: the species-area relationship|journal=Journal of Biogeography|year=2000|volume=27|pages=17–26|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00377.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main reasons for the relationship between number of species and area, both of which can be used as an argument for conservation of larger areas. The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis claims that a larger geographic area will have a greater variety of habitat types, and therefore more species adapted to each unique habitat type. Setting aside a small area will not encompass enough habitat variety to contain a large variety of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenzweig|first=Michael|title=Reconciliation ecology and the future of species diversity|journal=Oryx|year=2003|volume=37|pages=194–206|doi=10.1017/s0030605303000371}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equilibrium hypothesis draws from the theory of [[island biogeography]] as described by [[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson|Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacArthur, R. H. and E. O. Wilson|title=The Theory of Island Biogeography|year=1967|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large areas have large populations, which are less likely to go extinct through stochastic processes. The theory assumes that speciation rates are constant with area, and a lower extinction rate coupled with higher speciation leads to more species.

The species-area relationship has often been applied to conservation, often quantitatively. The simplest and most commonly used formula was first published by [[Frank W. Preston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Preston|first=F. W.|title=Time and Space and the Variation of Species|journal=Ecology|year=1960|volume=41|pages=612–627|doi=10.2307/1931793}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of species present in a given area increases in relationship to that area with the relationship S = cA&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt;  where S is the number of species, A is the area, and c and z are constants which vary with the system under study. This equation has frequently been used for designing reserve size and placement (see [[SLOSS debate]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Desmet|first=P|author2=R. Cowling |title=Using the species-area relationship to set baseline targets for conservation|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2004|volume=9|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common version of the equation used in reserve design is the formula for inter-island diversity, which has a z-value between 0.25-0.55,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Michael|title=Species diversity in space and time|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|location=Cambridge, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning protecting 5% of the available habitat will preserve 40% of the species present. However, inter-provincial species area relationships have z-values closer to 1, meaning protecting 5% of habitat will only protect 5% of species diversity.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt;

Taken together, proponents of reconciliation ecology see the species-area relationship and human domination of a large percentage of the earth's area as a sign that we will not be able to set aside enough land to protect all of life's biodiversity. There can be negative effects of setting land aside because it means the remaining land is used more intensely.&lt;ref name=Green /&gt; For example, less land is required for crop production when high levels of inorganic [[fertilizer]] is applied, but these chemicals will affect nearby land set aside for natural ecosystems. The direct benefits of land transformation for the growing world population often make it ethically difficult to justify the tradeoff between biodiversity and human use.&lt;ref name=Daily&gt;{{cite book|last=Daily|first=Gretchen|title=Countryside biogeography and the provision of ecosystem services.in Forum on Biodivesity.|year=1997|publisher=National Academy Press|location=National Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reconciled ecosystems are ones in which humans dominate, but natural biodiversity is encouraged to persist within the human landscape. Ideally, this creates a more sustainable [[socio-ecological system]] and does not necessitate a trade off between biodiversity and human use.

===Beyond natural history===
[[File:Lanius excubitor 1 (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|250px|thumb|The life history of the [[great grey shrike]] is better understood as a result of focused natural history and reconciliation ecology.]]
How can understanding of species' natural history aid their effective conservation in human-dominated ecosystems?  Humans often conduct activities that allow for the incorporation of other species, whether as a by-product or as a result of a focus on nature.&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005" /&gt;  Traditional [[natural history]] can only inform how best to do this to a certain degree, because landscapes have been changed so dramatically.  However, there is much more to learn through direct study of species' ecology in human-dominated [[ecosystems]], through what is known as focused natural history.  Rosenzweig &lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005" /&gt; cites four examples: [[shrikes]] (Laniidae) thrived in altered landscapes when wooden fence post perches allowed them easy access to pouncing on prey, but inhospitable [[steel fence post]]s contributed to their decline.  Replacing steel fence posts with wood fence posts reverses the shrikes' decline and allows humans to determine the reasons for the distribution and abundance of shrikes.  Additionally, the [[cirl bunting]] (''Emberiza cirlus'') thrived on farms when fields alternated between harvests and hay, but declined where farmers began to plant winter grain crops, [[natterjack toads]] (''Bufo calamatus'') declined when reductions in [[sheep]] grazing ceased to alter ponds to their preferred shape and depth, and [[longleaf pine]] (''Pinus palustris'') declined in the Southeastern United States when lack of [[wildfires]] prevented its return after [[timbering]].&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenzweig | first1 = M.L. | year = 2005 | title = Avoiding mass extinction: basic and applied challenges | url = | journal = The American Midland Naturalist | volume = 153 | issue = | pages = 195–208 | doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2005)153[0195:amebaa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noss 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noss | first1 = R.F. | last2 = Beier | first2 = P. | last3 = Covington | first3 = W.W. | last4 = Grumbine | first4 = R.E. | last5 = Lindenmayer | first5 = D.B. | last6 = Prather | first6 = J.W. | last7 = Schmiegelow | first7 = F. | last8 = Sisk | first8 = T.D. | last9 = Vosick | first9 = D.J. | year = 2006 | title = Recommendations for integrating restoration ecology and conservation biology in ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern united states | url = | journal = Restoration Ecology | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 4–10 | doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2006.00099.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, applying focused natural history in human-dominated landscapes can contribute to conservation efforts.

The emerging concept of [[ecosystem services]] (coined by the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] in 2005) changed the way ecologists perceived so-called "ordinary species" : as abundant species represent the bulk of biomass and biological processes, even if they don't appear directly threatened their conservation constitutes as a major concern for maintaining these services on which rely both human societies and rarer species.&lt;ref name="Couvet"/&gt; Reconciliation ecology then proposes to take care of such species and to maintain (or restore) ecological processes in human-dominated ecosystems, hence creating ecological corridors and preserving a good functioning of biological cycles.&lt;ref name="Couvet"/&gt;

==Benefits==
Reconciliation ecologists believe increasing biodiversity within human dominated landscapes will help to save global biodiversity. This is sometimes preferable to traditional conservation because it does not impair human use of the landscape and therefore may be more acceptable to stakeholders.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; However, not only will it encourage biodiversity in the areas where it takes place, but many scholars cite other benefits of including biodiversity in human landscapes on both global conservation activities and human well-being.

===Habitat connectivity benefits===
Increasing wildlife habitat in human-dominated systems not only increases ''in situ'' biodiversity, it also aids in conservation of surrounding protected areas by increasing connectivity between habitat patches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anand|first=M. O|author2=J. Krishnaswamy |author3=A. Kumar |author4=A.

===Educational benefits===
Placing importance on native ecosystems and biodiversity within human landscapes increases human exposure to natural areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=J. R|title=Biodiversity conservation and the extinction of experience|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|year=2005|volume=20|pages=430–434|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.05.013|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been shown to increase appreciation of nature. Studies have shown that students who participate in [[outdoor education]] programs show a greater understanding of their environment, greater willingness to act in order to save the environment, and even a greater enthusiasm for school and learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogner|first=F. X|title=The influence of short-term outdoor ecology education on long-term variables of environmental perspective|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|year=1998|volume=29|pages=17–29|doi=10.1080/00958969809599124|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dillon|first=J. |author2=M.

===Psychological benefits===
The results of reconciliation ecology can also improve human well-being. [[E. O. Wilson]] has hypothesized that humans have an innate desire to be close to nature (see [[biophilia hypothesis|Biophilia]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=E O|title=Biophilia|year=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous studies have linked natural settings to decreased stress and faster recovery during hospital stays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ulrich|first=R. S.|author2=R. F. Simons |author3=B. D. Losito |author4=E. Fiorito |author5=M. A. Miles |author6=M. Zelson |title=Stress recovery during exposures to natural and urban environments|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=1991|volume=11|pages=201–230|doi=10.1016/S0272-4944(05)80184-7|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Many examples of native plants and animals taking advantage of human dominated landscapes have been unintentional, but may be enhanced as part of reconciliation ecology. Others are intentional redesigns of human landscapes to better accommodate native biodiversity. These have been going on for many hundreds of years including examples within agricultural systems, urban and suburban systems, marine systems, and even industrial areas.

===Historical examples===
While Rosenzweig formalized the concept, humans have been encouraging biodiversity within human landscapes for millennia. In the Trebon Biosphere Reserve of the [[Czech Republic]], a system of human-engineered [[aquaculture]] ponds built in the 1500s not only provides a profitable harvest of fish, but also provides habitat for a hugely diverse wetland ecosystem. Many cities in Europe take pride in their local population of [[storks]], which nest on roofs or in church towers that replace the trees they would naturally nest in.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; There are records of humans maintaining plants in pleasure gardens as early as ancient [[Mesopotamia]], with an especially strong tradition of incorporating gardens into the architecture of human landscapes in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=X.|author2=J. Wu |title=Sustainable landscape architecture: implications of the Chinese philosophy of "unity of man with nature" and beyond|journal=Landscape Ecology|year=2009|volume=24|pages=1015–1026|doi=10.1007/s10980-009-9350-z|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural systems===
[[File:Faidherbia albida.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Agroforestry]] in [[Burkina Faso]] allows [[sorghum]] crop to be grown under native tree species, preserving biodiversity.]]
[[Agroforestry]] provides many examples of reconciliation ecology at work. In tropical agroforestry systems, crops such as [[coffee]] or fruit trees are cultivated under a canopy of shade trees, providing habitat for tropical forest species outside of protected areas.&lt;ref name=bhagwat&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhagwat|first=S. A. |author2=K. J. Willis |author3=H. J. B. Birks |author4=R. J. Whittaker|title=Agroforestry: a refuge for tropical biodiversity?|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|year=2008|volume=23|pages=261–268|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.01.005|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[shade-grown coffee]] plantations typically have lower tree diversity than unmanaged forests, however they have much higher tree species diversity and richness than other agricultural methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correia|first=M|author2=M. Diabate |author3=P. Beavogui |author4=K. Guilavogui |author5=N. Lamanda |author6=H. d. Foresta |title=Conserving forest tree diversity in Guinee Forestiere (Guinea, West Africa): the role of coffee-based agroforests|journal=Biodiversity Conservation|year=2010|volume=19|pages=1725–1747|doi=10.1007/s10531-010-9800-6|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture that mimics nature, encourages natural forest species along with the crops, and also takes pressure off nearby uncultivated forest areas where people are allowed to collect forest products.&lt;ref name=bhagwat /&gt;  The understory can also be managed with reconciliation ecology: allowing weeds to grow among crops (minimizing labor and preventing the invasion of noxious weed species) and leaving [[fallow]]lands alongside farmed areas can enhance [[understory]] plant richness with associated benefits for native insects and birds compared to other agricultural practices.&lt;ref name="Bobo 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bobo | first1 = K.S. | last2 = Waltert | first2 = M. | last3 = Sainge | first3 = N.M. | last4 = Njokagbor | first4 = J. | last5 = Fermon | first5 = H. | last6 = Muhlenberg | first6 = M. | year = 2006 | title = From forest to farmland: species richness patterns of trees and understorey plants along a gradient of forest conversion in Southwestern Cameroon | url = | journal = Biodiversity and Conservation | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 4097–4117 | doi=10.1007/s10531-005-3368-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[oil palm]] (''Elaeis guineensis'') provides another example of the potential of reconciliation ecology.  It is one of the most important and rapidly expanding tropical crops,&lt;ref name="Koh 2008a" /&gt; so lucrative because it is used in many products throughout the world. Unfortunately, oil-palm agriculture is one of the main drivers of forest conversion in Southeast Asia and is devastating for native [[biodiversity]], perhaps even more so than logging.&lt;ref name="Wilcove 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilcove | first1 = D.S. | last2 = Koh | first2 = L.P. | year = 2010 | title = Addressing the threats to biodiversity from oil-palm agriculture | url = | journal = Conservation of Biodiversity | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 999–1007 | doi=10.1007/s10531-009-9760-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, attempts are being made to foster the sustainability of this industry.  As a [[monoculture]], oil palm is subject to potentially devastating attacks from insect pests.&lt;ref name="Koh 2008a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koh | first1 = L.P. | year = 2008 | title = Can oil palm plantations be made more hospitable for forest butterflies and birds? | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Ecology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 1002–1009 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01491.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koh | first1 = L.P. | year = 2008 | title = Birds defend oil palms from herbivorous insects | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 821–825 | doi=10.1890/07-1650.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies are attempting an [[integrated pest management]] approach which encourages the planting of species that support [[Predation|predators]] and [[parasitoids]] of these insect pests, as well as an active native bird community.&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b" /&gt; Experiments have shown that a functioning bird community, especially at higher densities, can serve to reduce insect herbivory on oil palms, promoting increased crop yields and profits.&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b" /&gt;  Thus, oil palm plantation managers can participate in reconciliation ecology by promoting local vegetation that is beneficial to [[insectivorous]] birds, including maintaining ground plants that serve as nesting sites, thereby protecting natural communities.  Additionally, steps such as maintaining [[riparian buffer zones]] or natural forest patches can help to slow the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] within oil palm plantation landscapes.&lt;ref name="Wilcove 2010" /&gt;  By engaging in these environmentally friendly practices, fewer chemicals and less effort are required to maintain both plantation productivity and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name="Koh 2008a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b" /&gt;

There are many grazing practices that also encourage native biodiversity. In Rosenzweig’s book he uses the example of a rancher in [[Arizona]] who intentionally deepened his cattle ponds in order to save a population of threatened [[leopard frog]]s (''Rana chiricahuensis''), with no detriment to the use of those tanks for cattle,&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; and a similar situation has occurred with the vulnerable [[California tiger salamander]] (''Ambystoma californiense'') in the Central Valley of California. Research has shown that without cattle grazing, many of the remaining [[vernal pool]]s would dry too early for the salamanders to complete their life cycle under global climate change predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pyke|first=C. R.|author2=J. Marty |title=Cattle Grazing Mediates Climate Change Impacts on Ephemeral Wetlands|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2005|volume=19|issue=5|pages=1619–1625|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00233.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Central America, a large percentage of pastureland is fenced using live trees which are not only low maintenance for the farmer, but also provide habitat for birds, bats, and invertebrates which cannot persist in open pastureland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=C. A. |author2=C. Villanueva |author3=J. Villacís |author4=M. Chacón |author5=D. Muñoz |author6=M. López |author7=M. Ibrahim |author8=R. Gómez |author9=R. Taylor |author10=J. Martinez |author11=A.

===Urban systems===
[[File:MEC's green roof among others.jpg|250px|thumb|Green roofs can help maintain species diversity in urban landscapes.]]
[[Urban ecology]] can be included under the umbrella of reconciliation ecology and it tackles biodiversity in cities, the most extreme of human-dominated landscapes. Cities occupy less than 3% of global surface area, but are responsible for a majority of carbon emissions, residential water use, and wood use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=L. R.|title=Eco-Economy: building an economy for the Earth|year=2001|publisher=Norton|location=New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities also have unique climatic conditions such as the [[urban heat island]] effect, which can greatly affect biodiversity.&lt;ref name=Grimm&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grimm|first=N. B.|author2=S. H. Faeth |author3=N. E. Golubiewski |author4=C. L. Redman |author5=J. Wu |author6=X. Bai |author7=J. M. Briggs |title=Global Change and the Ecology of Cities|journal=Science|year=2008|volume=319|pages=756–760 | doi = 10.1126/science.1150195|issue=5864|pmid=18258902 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing trend among city managers to take biodiversity into account when planning city development, especially in rapidly growing cities. Cities often have surprisingly high plant biodiversity due to their normally high degree of habitat heterogeneity and high numbers of gardens and green spaces cultivated to include a large variety of species.&lt;ref name=Grimm /&gt; However, these species are often not native, and a large part of the total urban biodiversity is usually made up of exotic species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=G |author2=G. Jiang |author3=Y. Zhou |author4=Q. Liu |author5=Y. Ji |author6=S. Wang |author7=S. Chen |author8=H.

Because cities are so highly impacted by human activities, restoration to the pristine state is not possible, however there are modifications that can be made to increase habitat without negatively impacting human needs. In urban rivers, addition of large woods and floating islands to provide habitat, modifications to walls and other structures to mimic natural banks, and buffer areas to reduce pollutants can all increase biodiversity without reducing the [[flood control]] and water supply services.&lt;ref name=Francis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=R. A.|title=Perspectives on the potential for reconciliation ecology in urban riverscapes|journal=CAB Reviews: Perspectives in Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Nutrition and Natural Resources|year=2009|volume=4|pages=1–20|doi=10.1079/pavsnnr20094073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban green spaces can be re-designed to encourage natural ecosystems rather than manicured [[lawn]]s, as is seen in the [[National Wildlife Federation]]’s Backyard Wildlife Habitat program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tufts, C. and P. Loewer|title=Gardening for wildlife|year=1995|publisher=Rodale Press|location=Emmaus, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peregrine falcon]]s (''Falco peregrinus''), which were once endangered by [[pesticide]] use, are frequently seen nesting in tall urban buildings throughout North America, feeding chiefly on the introduced [[rock dove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cade|first=T|author2=D. Bird |title=Peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus, nesting in an urban environment: a review|journal=Canadian Field-Naturalist|year=1990|volume=104|pages=209–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steep walls of buildings mimic the cliffs peregrines naturally nest in and the rock doves replace the native prey species that were driven out of urban areas.

===Industrial systems===
{{further|industrial ecology}}
In Florida, the [[Florida manatee]] (''Trichechus manatus latirostris'') uses warm water discharged from power plants as a refuge when the temperature of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] drops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laist|first=D. W.|author2=J. E. Reynolds |title=Florida manatees, warm-water refuges, and an uncertain future|journal=Coastal Management|year=2005|volume=33|pages=279–295|doi=10.1080/08920750590952018|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These warm areas replace the warm springs that manatees once naturally used in the winter. These springs have been drained or cut off from open water by human uses. [[American crocodile]]s (''Crocodylus acutus'') have a similar habitat in the cooling canals of the [[Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station|Turkey Point]] power plant, where an estimated 10% of the total North American population of the species lives.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt;

[[Wastewater treatment]] systems have shown potential for reconciliation ecology on numerous occasions. Man-made wetlands designed to remove nitrogen before runoff from agriculture enters the [[Everglades]] in Florida are used as breeding sites for a number of birds, including the endangered [[wood stork]] (''Mycteria americana'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frederick|first=P. C|author2=S. M. McGhee. |title=Wading bird use of wastewater treament wetlands in central Florida, USA|journal=Colonial Waterbirds|year=1994|volume=17|pages=50–59|doi=10.2307/1521381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stormwater treatment ponds can provide important breeding habitat for amphibians, especially where natural wetlands have been drained by human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brand|first=A.

===Ocean systems===
[[Coral reefs]] have been intensively impacted by human use, including [[overfishing]] and mining of the reef itself. One reconciliation approach to this problem is building [[artificial reef]]s that not only provide valuable habitat for aquatic species, but also protect nearby islands from storms when the natural structure has been mined away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=S|author2=A. J. Edwards |title=An evaluation of artificial reef structures as tools for marine habitat rehabilitation in the Maldives|journal=Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems|year=1998|volume=9|pages=5–21|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0755(199901/02)9:1&lt;5::aid-aqc330&gt;3.0.co;2-u}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even structures as simple as scrap metal and automobiles can be used as habitat, providing added benefits of freeing space in landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brock|first=R. E|author2=J. E. Norris |title=An analysis of four artificial reef designs in tropical waters|journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|year=1989|volume=44|pages=934–941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
Governmental intervention can aid in encouraging private landowners to create habitat or otherwise increase biodiversity on their land. The United States' [[Endangered Species Act]] requires landowners to halt any activities negatively affecting endangered species on their land, which is a disincentive for them to encourage endangered species to settle on their land in the first place.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; To help mediate this problem, the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] has instituted safe harbor agreements whereby the landowner engages in restoration on their land to encourage endangered species, and the government agrees not to place further regulation on their activities should they want to reverse the restoration at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilcove|first=D. S|author2=J. Lee |title=Using economic and regulatory incentives to restore endangered species: lessons learned from three new programs|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2004|issue=3|pages=639–645|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00250.x|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has already led to an increase in [[aplomado falcon]]s (''Falco femoralis'') in [[Texas]] and [[red-cockaded woodpecker]]s (''Picoides borealis'') in the Southeastern US.

Another example is the [[US Department of Agriculture]]’s [[Conservation Reserve Program]] (CRP). The CRP was originally put in place to protect soil from erosion, but also has major implications for conservation of biodiversity.  In the program, landowners take their land out of agricultural production and plant trees, shrubs, and other permanent, [[erosion control]]ling vegetation. Unintended, but ecologically significant consequences of this were the reduction of runoff, improved water quality, creation of wildlife habitat, and possible [[carbon sequestration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=C. P|author2=F. Stearns |author3=G. R. Guntenspergen |author4=D. M. Sharpe |title=Ecological benefits of the Conservation Reserve Program|journal=Conservation Biology|year=1993|volume=7|pages=132–139|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1993.07010132.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
While reconciliation ecology attempts to modify the human world to encourage biodiversity without negatively impacting human use, there are still difficulties in getting broad acceptance of the idea. For example, addition of large woods to urban river systems, which provides critical habitat structure for native fish and invertebrates may be seen as "untidy" and a sign of poor management by residents.&lt;ref name=Francis /&gt; Similarly, many suburban areas do not allow long, unkempt lawns that provide useful wildlife habitat because of perceived damage to property values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=P|author2=A. Polderman |author3=T. Birkenholtz |title=Lawns and Toxins: An Ecology of the City|journal=Cities|year=2001|volume=18|pages=369–380|doi=10.1016/S0264-2751(01)00029-4|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many humans have negative feelings toward certain species, especially [[predator]]s such as wolves, which are often based more on perceived risk than actual risk of loss or injury resulting from the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=K. M|title=Carnivore-Livestock Conflicts: Effects of Subsidized Predator Control and Economic Correlates on the Sheep Industry|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2006|volume=20|pages=751–761|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00336.x|pmid=16909568|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even with cooperation of the human element of the equation, reconciliation ecology can not help every species. Some animals, such as several species of [[waterfowl]], show strong avoidance behaviors toward humans and any form of human disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gill|first=J. A|author2=K. Norris |author3=W. J.

[[Image:HoleForceLines.gif|thumb|right| Internal [[force lines]] are denser near the hole]]

A '''stress concentration''' (often called '''stress raisers''' or '''stress risers''') is a location in an object where [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] is concentrated. An object is stronger when force is evenly distributed over its area, so a reduction in area, e.g., caused by a crack, results in a localized increase in stress. A material can fail, via a [[crack propagation|propagating crack]], when a concentrated stress exceeds the material's theoretical cohesive strength. The real [[fracture]] strength of a material is always lower than the theoretical value because most materials contain small cracks or contaminants (especially foreign particles) that concentrate stress. [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]] cracks always start at stress raisers, so removing such defects increases the [[fatigue strength]].

==Causes==
[[Image:Cracking in concrete due to stress concentration.jpg|right|thumb|The sharp corner at the brick has acted as a stress concentrator within the concrete causing it to crack]]

1) Geometric discontinuities cause an object to experience a local increase in the intensity of a stress field.  Examples of shapes that cause these concentrations are cracks, sharp corners, holes, and changes in the cross-sectional area of the object. High local stresses can cause objects to fail more quickly, so engineers must design the geometry to minimize stress concentrations.

2) Due to discontinuities in applied loads.

3) Material discontinuities which may occur while manufacturing.

==Prevention==
A counter-intuitive method of reducing one of the worst types of stress concentrations, a [[Fracture|crack]], is to [[drill]] a large hole at the end of the crack.  The drilled hole, with its relatively large [[diameter]], causes a smaller stress concentration than the sharp end of a crack.  This is however, a temporary solution that must be corrected at the first opportune time. 

It is important to systematically check for possible stress concentrations caused by cracks—there is a critical crack length of 2a for which, when this value is exceeded, the crack proceeds to definite catastrophic failure. This ultimate failure is definite since the crack will propagate on its own once the length is greater than 2a. (There is no additional energy required to increase the crack length so the crack will continue to enlarge until the material fails.) The origins of the value 2a can be understood through [[A. A. Griffith|Griffith]]'s theory of [[fracture#Brittle fracture|brittle fracture]].

Another method used to decrease the stress concentration is by creating the fillet at the sharp edges. It gives smooth flow of stress streamlines. In a threaded component force flow line is bent as it passes from shank portion to threaded portion as a result stress concentration takes place. To reduce this a small undercut is taken between shank and threaded portion.

==Examples==
[[Image:Cdm hip implant 348.jpg|right|thumb|This [[orthosis]] is implanted to support the femur after a [[hip fracture|fracture]], but the concentration of stress at its bend increases the possibility that it may break under force.]]
The term "stress raiser" is used in [[orthopedics]]; a focus point of stress on an [[implant (medicine)|implanted]] [[orthosis]] is very likely to be its point of failure.

Classic cases of [[metallurgy|metal]] failures due to stress concentrations include [[metal fatigue]] at the corners of the windows of the [[De Havilland Comet]] [[aircraft]] and brittle fractures at the corners of hatches in [[Liberty ship]]s in cold and stressful conditions in winter storms in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

==Concentration factor for cracks==

The maximum stress felt near a crack occurs in the area of lowest [[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]].  In an elliptical crack of length &lt;math&gt;2a&lt;/math&gt; and width &lt;math&gt;2b&lt;/math&gt;, under an applied external stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the stress at the ends of the major axes is given by Inglis' equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{max} = \sigma\left(1+2\cfrac{a}{b}\right) = \sigma\left(1+2\sqrt{\cfrac{a}{\rho}}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is the radius of curvature of the crack tip.  A '''stress concentration factor''' is the ratio of the highest stress (&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{max}&lt;/math&gt;) to a reference stress (&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;) of the gross cross-section.  As the radius of curvature approaches zero, the maximum stress approaches infinity.  Note that the stress concentration factor is a function of the geometry of a crack, and not of its size.  These factors can be found in typical engineering reference materials to predict the stresses  that could otherwise not be analyzed using [[strength of materials]] approaches.  This is not to be confused with '[[Stress Intensity Factor]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schijve |first=Jaap |title=Fatigue of Structures and Materials |year=2001 |publisher=Springer |page=90 |isbn=978-0792370147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concentration factor calculation==
There are experimental methods for measuring stress concentration factors including [[photoelasticity|photoelastic stress analysis]], brittle coatings or [[strain gauge]]s. While all these approaches have been successful, all also have experimental, environmental, accuracy and/or measurement disadvantages.

During the design phase, there are multiple approaches to estimating stress concentration factors. Several catalogs of stress concentration factors have been published. Perhaps most famous is ''Stress Concentration Design Factors'' by Peterson, first published in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peterson |first=Rudolf Earl |title=Stress Concentration Design Factors |year=1953 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0471683766}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Finite element method]]s are commonly used in design today. Theoretical approaches, using elasticity or strength of material considerations, can lead to equations similar to the one shown above.

There may be small differences between the catalog, FEM and theoretical values calculated. Each method has advantages and disadvantages. Many catalog curves were derived from experimental data. FEM calculates the peak stresses directly and nominal stresses may be easily found by integrating stresses in the surrounding material. The result is that engineering judgment may have to be used when selecting which data applies to making a design decision. Many theoretical stress concentration factors have been derived for infinite or semi-infinite geometries which may not be analyzable and are not testable in a stress lab, but tackling a problem using two or more of these approaches will allow an engineer to achieve an accurate conclusion.

A '''tactical air navigation system''', commonly referred to by the [[acronym]] '''TACAN''', is a [[navigation]] system used by military aircraft. It provides the user with bearing and distance (slant-range or hypotenuse) to a ground or ship-borne station. It is a more accurate version of the [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]]/[[distance measuring equipment|DME]] system that provides [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] and [[distance|range]] information for [[civil aviation]]. The DME portion of the TACAN system is available for civil use; at [[VORTAC]] facilities where a VOR is [[:wikt:combine|combine]]d with a TACAN, civil aircraft can receive VOR/DME readings. Aircraft equipped with TACAN [[avionics]] can use this system for en route navigation as well as [[Instrument approach#Non-precision approaches and systems|non-precision approach]]es to landing fields. The [[space shuttle]] is one such vehicle that was designed to use TACAN navigation but later upgraded with [[GPS]] as a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The typical TACAN onboard user panel has control switches for setting the channel (corresponding to the desired surface station's assigned frequency), the operation mode for either transmit/receive (T/R, to get both bearing and range) or receive only (REC, to get bearing but not range). Capability was later upgraded to include an air-to-air mode (A/A) where two airborne users can get relative slant-range information. Depending on the installation, Air-to-Air mode may provide range, closure (relative velocity of the other unit), and bearing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5128873/description.html | author=Rockwell International | date=July 7, 1992 | title=Aircraft rendezvous using low data rate two-way TACAN bearing information | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612222405/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5128873/description.html | archivedate=June 12, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though an air-to-air bearing is noticeably less precise than a ground-to-air bearing. A TACAN only equipped aircraft cannot receive bearing information from a VOR only station.

==History==
The TACAN navigation system is an evolution of [[radio]] [[transponder]] navigation systems that date back to the British [[Oboe (navigation)|Oboe system]] of [[World War II]]. In the United States, many companies were involved with the development of TACAN for military aircraft. Hoffman Laboratories Div. of the [[H. Leslie (Les) Hoffman|Hoffman Electronics Corp.–Military Products Division]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/missilesrockets5195unse#page/126/mode/2up ''Missiles and Rockets''], July 20, 1959, v. 5, no. 30, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; (now NavCom Defense Electronics)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navcom.com/ NavCom Defense Electronics&lt;/ref&gt; was a leader in developing the present TACAN system in the US starting in the late 1950s.

==Operation==
[[Image:TACAN Antenna.jpg|thumb|upright|A US Air Force TACAN antenna.]]
TACAN in general can be described as the military version of the VOR/DME system. It operates in the [[frequency]] band 960-1215 [[MHz]]. The bearing unit of TACAN is more accurate than a standard VOR since it makes use of a two-frequency principle, with 15&amp;nbsp;Hz and 135&amp;nbsp;Hz components, and because [[UHF]] transmissions are less prone to signal bending than [[VHF]].

The distance measurement component of TACAN operates with the same specifications as civil DMEs. Therefore, to reduce the number of required stations, TACAN stations are frequently co-located with VOR facilities. These co-located stations are known as [[VORTAC]]s. This is a station composed of a VOR for civil bearing information and a TACAN for military bearing information and military/civil distance measuring information. The TACAN transponder performs the function of a DME without the need for a separate co-located DME. Because the rotation of the antenna creates a large portion of the [[azimuth]] (bearing) signal, if the antenna fails, the azimuth component is no longer available and the TACAN downgrades to a DME only mode.

==Accuracy==
Theoretically a TACAN should provide a 9-fold increase in [[accuracy]] compared to a VOR, but operational use has shown only an approximate 3-fold increase.&lt;ref name="tacan_vor_acc"&gt;{{cite web | author=Albert Helfrick | year=2009 | title=Principle of avionics 5th edition | type=book | work= | publisher= | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accuracy of the 135&amp;nbsp;Hz azimuth component is ±1° or ±63 m at 3.47&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="frs2001"&gt;{{cite web | author=Department of Transportation and Department of Defense | date=March 25, 2002 | url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/frp/frp2001/FRS2001.pdf | title=2001 Federal Radionavigation Systems | format=PDF | work= | publisher= | accessdate=November 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accuracy of the DME portion must be {{cvt|926|m|nmi}} or 3 percent of slant range distance, whichever is greater, per FAA 9840.1 1982.&lt;ref name="frs2001" /&gt; and FAA N8200.121

TACAN stations can provide distance up to 390 nautical miles.{{Citation needed|reason=many official references say the TACAN standard service volume, for both range and azimuth, is the same as for a VOR,  Also, "up to" verges on weasel words; clarification needed as to what is provided, when, and to whom.|date=January 2017}}

Modern TACANs are much more accurate. The requirement now is to have portable TACAN that is IFR certifiable, both station and portable systems. The latest modern version of TACAN has been tested and could be a feasible back-up to future Air traffic control systems and may even be integrated into systems for a seamless back up.

Past TACANs have relied on high output power (up to 10,000 watts) to ensure good signal in space to overcome nulls present in antenna design and to provide their required{{Citation needed|reason=many official references say the TACAN standard service volume, for both range and azimuth, is the same as for a VOR; |date=January 2017}} 200 mile range. With the advancement of technology, antenna design has improved with higher gain antennas, much shallower nulls, and lighter construction. Now it's feasible to have a 200&amp;nbsp;nmi range with a 400 watt TACAN DME transmitter, making the TACAN package much smaller, more portable and more reliable (a decrease in power also reduces heat, which lengthens the life of electronics).

On the first [[Space Shuttle]] flight, [[Capsule communicator|Capcom]] [[Joseph P. Allen]] reported up to the crew that their TACANs had locked onto the Channel 111 signals at [[St Petersburg]], FL at a range of 250 miles.

TACAN is getting smaller: full TACAN coverage can now be provided in a system that can be carried on a single trailer weighing less than 4000&amp;nbsp;lbs, and set up by two people in less than an hour. TACAN Transceivers can now be as small as lunch boxes (with full coverage and range) and the antennas can be reduced from 800 pounds to less than 100 pounds.

==Benefits==
[[Image:TACAN Antenna Shemya.jpg|thumb|upright|TACAN antenna at [[Shemya, Alaska]].]]
Because the azimuth and range units are combined in one system it provides for simpler installation. Less space is required than a VOR because a VOR requires a large counterpoise and a fairly complex phased antenna system. A TACAN system theoretically might be placed on a building, a large truck, an airplane, or a ship, and be operational in a short period of time. An airborne TACAN receiver can be used in air-to-air mode, which allows two cooperating aircraft to find their relative bearings and distance.

==Drawbacks==
[[Image:USS Raleigh (LPD-1) TACAN.jpg|thumb|A shipboard TACAN antenna on [[USS Raleigh (LPD-1)|USS ''Raleigh'' (LPD-1)]] with a [[lightning rod]] extending above it.]]
For military usage a primary drawback is lack of the ability to control emissions ([[EMCON]]) and stealth. Naval TACAN operations are designed so an aircraft can find the ship and land. There is no encryption involved, an enemy can simply use the range and bearing provided to attack a ship equipped with a TACAN. Some TACANs have the ability to employ a "Demand Only" mode wherein they will only transmit when interrogated by an aircraft on-channel. It is likely that TACAN will be replaced with a differential GPS system similar to the [[Local Area Augmentation System]] called JPALS. The [[Joint Precision Approach and Landing System]] has a low probability of intercept to prevent enemy detection and an aircraft carrier version can be used for [[autoland]] operations.

Some systems used in the United States modulate the transmitted signal by using a 900 RPM rotating antenna. Since this antenna is fairly large and must rotate 24 hours a day, it can cause reliability issues. Modern systems have antennas that use electronic rotation (instead of mechanical rotation) with no moving parts.

==Future==
Like all other forms of ground-based aircraft radio navigation currently used, it is likely that TACAN will eventually be replaced by some form of space-based navigational system such as GPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Department of Transportation and Department of Defense | date=March 25, 2002 | url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/frp/frp2001/FRP2001.pdf | title=2001 Federal Radionavigation Plan | format=PDF | work= | publisher= | accessdate=August 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the physical [[wire]] or other signaling medium connecting the user's telephone apparatus to the [[telecommunications]] network, and usually also implies a single [[telephone number]] for [[invoice|billing]] purposes reserved for that user. Telephone lines are used to deliver [[landline]] telephone service and [[Digital subscriber line]] (DSL) phone cable service to the premises. Telephone overhead lines are connected to the [[public switched telephone network]].

== United States ==
In 1878, the [[Bell System|Bell Telephone Company]] began to use two-wire circuits (called the [[local loop]]) from each user's telephone to [[Telephone exchange|end office]]s which performed any necessary electrical switching to allow voice signals to be transmitted to more distant telephones.

These wires were typically [[copper]], although [[aluminium]] has also been used, and were carried in [[balanced pair]]s of open wire, separated by about 25&amp;nbsp;cm (10") on [[utility pole|poles]] above the ground, and later as [[twisted pair]] cables. Modern lines may run underground, and may carry analog or digital signals to the exchange, or may have [[Subscriber Loop Carrier|a device that converts]] the [[analog signal]] to digital for [[transmission (telecom)|transmission]] on a [[carrier system]].

Often the customer end of that wire pair is connected to a [[data access arrangement]];
the telephone company end of that wire pair is connected to a [[telephone hybrid]].

In most cases, two copper wires ([[tip and ring]]) for each telephone line run from a home or other small building to a local [[telephone exchange]].  There is a central [[junction box]] for the building where the wires that go to telephone jacks throughout the building and wires that go to the exchange meet and can be connected in different configurations depending upon the subscribed telephone service.  The wires between the junction box and the exchange are known as the [[local loop]], and the network of wires going to an exchange, the [[access network]].

The vast majority of houses in the U.S. are wired with 6-position [[modular connector|modular jacks]] with four [[electrical conductor|conductors]] ([[6P4C]]) wired to the house's junction box with copper wires.  Those wires may be connected back to two telephone overhead lines at the local [[telephone exchange]], thus making those jacks [[RJ11, RJ14, RJ25|RJ14]] jacks. More often, only two of the wires are connected to the exchange as one telephone line, and the others are unconnected.  In that case, the jacks in the house are [[RJ11, RJ14, RJ25|RJ11]].

Older houses often have 4-conductor telephone station cable in the walls color coded with Bell System colors: red, green, yellow, black as 2-pairs of 22 AWG (0.33&amp;nbsp;mm²) solid copper; "line 1" uses the red/green pair and "line 2" uses the yellow/black pair.
Inside the walls of the house—between the house's outside junction box and the interior [[wall jack]]s—the most common telephone cable in new houses is [[Category 5 cable]]—4 pairs of 24 AWG (0.205&amp;nbsp;mm²) solid copper.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside large buildings, and in the outdoor cables that run to the telephone company [[point of presence|POP]], many telephone lines are bundled together in a single cable using the [[25-pair color code]].

'''TeraView Limited''', or '''TeraView''', is a company that designs [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] imaging and spectroscopy instruments and equipment for measurement and evaluation of [[Tablet (pharmacy)|pharmaceutical tablets]], [[nanomaterials]], ceramics and composites, [[integrated circuit]] chips and more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teraview.com/about/index.html "TeraView Company Overview"]&lt;/ref&gt;

TeraView was co-founded by [[Michael Pepper]] (CSO) and Dr Don Arnone (CEO) as a spin-out of [[Toshiba| Toshiba Research Europe]] in April 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teraview.com/about/index.html "About TeraView"]&lt;/ref&gt; The company was set up to exploit the intellectual property and expertise developed in sourcing and detecting [[terahertz radiation]] (1 THz= 33.3&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), using semiconductor technologies. Leading industry proponents of the technology sit on its Advisory Board, and TeraView maintains close links with the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enterprise.cam.ac.uk/industry/equity-portfolio/c/teraview-ltd/ "University of Cambridge Enterprise"]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Cambridge]], which was one of the research universities which had an interest in Terahertz techniques. It is also where Professor Pepper,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/staff/pepper "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering and the London Centre for Nanotechnology"]&lt;/ref&gt; has held the position of Professor of Physics since 1987.

== Research and development areas ==
{{Main|Terahertz radiation}}
The company's primary focus of investigation includes the development of terahertz light into a useful[[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] and imaging technique. The ‘[[terahertz gap]]’ – where until recently bright sources of light and sensitive means of detection were difficult to access – encompasses frequencies invisible to the naked eye in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], lying between [[microwave]] and [[infrared]] in the range from 0.3 to 3THz. TeraView's existing instruments generate, detect and manipulate THz light and have been tested in a number of application areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4152">[[File:Oscillation amortie.svg|thumb|[[Damping|Damped oscillation]] is a typical transient response, where the output value oscillates until finally reaching a steady-state value (The [[underdamped]] response case).]]

In [[electrical engineering]] and [[mechanical engineering]], a '''transient response''' is the response of a system to a change from an [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] or a [[steady state]]. The transient response is not necessarily tied to abrupt events but to any event that affects the equilibrium of the system. The [[impulse response]] and [[step response]] are transient responses to a specific input (an impulse and a step, respectively).

==Damping==
The response can be classified as one of three types of [[damping]] that describes the output in relation to the [[steady-state response]].

;Underdamped
:An [[underdamped]] response is one that oscillates within a decaying [[Envelope (mathematics)|envelope]].  The more underdamped the system, the more oscillations and longer it takes to reach steady-state. Here [[damping ratio]] is always less than one.
;Critically damped
:A [[critically damped]] response is that response which reaches the steady-state value the fastest without being underdamped. It is related to [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] in the sense that it straddles the boundary of underdamped and [[overdamped]] responses. Here, damping ratio is always equal to one. There should be no oscillation about the steady state value in the ideal case.
;Overdamped
:An overdamped response is the response that does not oscillate about the steady-state value but takes longer to reach steady-state than the critically damped case. Here damping ratio is  greater than one.

==Properties==
[[File:Second order under-damped response.svg|thumb|Typical second order transient system properties]]
Transient response can be quantified with the following properties.
;Rise time
:[[Rise time]] refers to the time required for a signal to change from a specified low value to a specified high value. Typically, these values are 10% and 90% of the step height.
;Overshoot
:[[Overshoot (signal)|Overshoot]] is when a signal or function exceeds its target. It is often associated with [[Ringing (signal)|ringing]].
;Settling time
:[[Settling time]] is the time elapsed from the application of an ideal instantaneous step input to the time at which the output has entered and remained within a specified [[error band]].
;Delay-time
:The delay time is the time required for the response to reach half the final value the very first time.&lt;ref name="Ogata230"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Modern Control Engineering |edition=4 | first = Katsuhiko | last = Ogata | publisher = Prentice-Hall | isbn = 0-13-043245-8 | page = 230}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Peak time
:The peak time is the time required for the response to reach the first peak of the overshoot.&lt;ref name="Ogata230"/&gt;
;Steady-state error
:2003's ''Instrument Engineers' Handbook'' defines the steady-state error of a system as "the difference between the desired final output and the actual one" when the system reaches a [[steady state]], when its behavior may be expected to continue if the system is undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Instrument Engineers' Handbook: Process control and optimization | first = Béla G. | last = Lipták | edition = 4th | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-8493-1081-4 | page = 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wagonways''' (or '''Waggonways''') consisted of the horses, equipment and tracks used for hauling wagons, which preceded [[Steam railroad|steam-powered railways]]. The terms '''[[plateway]]''', [[tramway (industrial)|'''tramway''']] and '''dramway''' were used. The advantage of wagonways was that far bigger loads could be transported with the same power.

== Ancient systems ==

The earliest {{citation needed||date=September 2017}} evidence is of the 6 to 8.5&amp;nbsp;km long ''[[Diolkos]]'' paved trackway, which transported boats across the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] in [[Greece]] from around 600 BC.&lt;ref name=" Verdelis, mikolaos (1950stas), 526"&gt;Verdelis, Nikolaos: "Le diolkos de L'Isthme", ''Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique'', Vol. 81 (1957), pp. 526–529 (526)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook, R.

== Wooden rails ==

[[File:Mining cart.jpg|thumb|left|[[Minecart]] shown in ''[[De Re Metallica]]'' (1556). The guide pin fits in a groove between two wooden planks.]]
Such an operation was illustrated in Germany in 1556 by [[Georgius Agricola]] (image right) in his work [[De re metallica]].&lt;ref&gt;Georgius Agricola (trans Hoover), ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1913), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; This line used "Hund" carts with unflanged wheels running on wooden planks and a vertical pin on the truck fitting into the gap between the planks to keep it going the right way. The miners called the wagons ''Hunde'' ("dogs") from the noise they made on the tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Charles E. |title=The Evolution of Railways |edition=2 |year=1943 |publisher=Railway Gazette |location=London |page=16 |oclc=1591369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlin Technikmuseum Holzbahn.jpg|thumb|Cart from 16th century, found in [[Transylvania]]]]
Around 1568, [[Germans|German]] [[mining|miners]] working in the [[Society of Mines Royal|Mines Royal]] near [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] used such a system. Archaeological work at the Mines Royal site at Caldbeck in the English Lake District confirmed the use of "''hunds''".&lt;ref&gt;Warren Allison, Samuel Murphy, and Richard Smith, 'An Early Railway in the German Mines of Caldbeck' in G. Boyes (ed.), ''Early Railways 4: Papers from the 4th International Early Railways Conference 2008'' (Six Martlets, Sudbury, 2010), 52–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

In 1604, [[Huntingdon Beaumont]] completed the [[Wollaton Wagonway]], built to transport [[coal]] from the mines at [[Strelley, Nottinghamshire|Strelley]] to [[Wollaton]] Lane End, just west of [[Nottingham]], [[England]]. Wagonways have been discovered between [[Broseley]] and [[Jackfield]] in [[Shropshire]] from 1605, used by James Clifford to transport coal from his mines in Broseley to the Severn River. It has been suggested that these are somewhat older than that at Wollaton.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web |title=Time line for early railway developments &amp; Wollaton Waggonway associated dates|url=http://www.stephensonloco.org.uk/time_line.htm|date=15 October 2007|publisher=Stephenson Locomotive Society &amp; Waggonway Research Circle|accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter King, ‘The First Shropshire Railways’ in G. Boyes (ed.), ''Early Railways 4: Papers from the 4th International Early Railways Conference 2008'' (Six Martlets, Sudbury, 2010), 70–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middleton Railway]] in [[Leeds]], which was built in 1758 as a wagonway, later became the world's first operational railway (other than funiculars), albeit in an upgraded form. In 1764, the first railway in the America was built in [[Lewiston, New York]] as a wagonway.&lt;ref name=Porter&gt;{{cite book | last=Porter |first=Peter |title=Landmarks of the Niagara Frontier |publisher=The Author |year=1914 | isbn=0-665-78347-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wagonways improved coal transport by allowing one horse to deliver between {{convert|10|to|13|LT|t ST|1|lk=on}} of [[coal]] per run{{mdash}} an approximate fourfold increase. Wagonways were usually designed to carry the fully loaded wagons downhill to a [[canal]] or boat dock and then return the empty wagons back to the mine.

== Metal rails ==

Until the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]], rails were made of wood, were a few inches wide and were fastened end to end, on logs of wood or "sleepers", placed crosswise at intervals of two or three feet. In time, it became common to cover them with a thin flat sheathing or "plating" of iron, in order to add to their life&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Railways |volume=21 |pages=819–820 |first=Hugh Munro |last=Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reduce friction. This caused more wear on the wooden rollers of the wagons and towards the middle of the 18th century, led to the introduction of iron wheels. However, the iron sheathing was not strong enough to resist buckling under the passage of the loaded wagons, so rails made wholly of iron were invented.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

&lt;!-- {{convert}} does not always give a happy level of precision in the next few paras, 1mm is too fine &amp; 10mm too coarse --&gt;
In 1760 the [[Coalbrookdale]] Iron Works began to reinforce their wooden railed tramway with iron bars,&lt;ref name="PMEM1844"&gt;"Historical Notes on Railways". The Practical Mechanic and Engineers Magazine, November 1844, pp. 57–60&lt;/ref&gt; which were found to facilitate passage and diminish expenses. As a result, in 1767, they began to make [[cast iron]] rails. These were probably {{convert|6|ft||sigfig=4|abbr=on|round=5}} long, with four projecting ears or lugs {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on|round=5}} by {{convert|3+3/4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} to enable them to be fixed to the sleepers. The rails were {{convert|3+3/4|in|mm|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|1+1/4|in|mm|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} thick. Later, descriptions also refer to rails {{convert|3|ft|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on|round=5}} long and only {{convert|2|in|mm|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lewis|first=Michael Jonathan Taunton|title=Early Wooden Railways|year=1970|publisher=Routledge &amp; K. Paul|location=London|isbn=0-7100-6674-0|oclc=138270|pages= 160–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plateways, Flangeways ===
[[File:Little Eaton Tramway Replica Wagon small.jpg|thumb|right|A replica of a "Little Eaton Tramway" wagon, the tracks are plateways]]
A later system involved [[Cross section (geometry)|"L" shaped]] [[Rail profile#Flanged rail|iron rails or plates]], each {{convert|3|ft|mm|abbr=on|round=5}} long and {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on|round=5}} wide, having on the inner side an upright ledge or flange, {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on|round=5}} high at the centre and tapering to {{convert|2|in|mm|abbr=on|round=5}} at the ends, for the purpose of keeping the flat wheels on the track. Subsequently, to increase strength, a similar flange might be added below the rail.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Wooden sleepers continued to be used{{mdash}}the rails were secured by [[Rail spike|spikes]] passing through the extremities{{mdash}}but, circa 1793, stone blocks began to be used, an innovation associated with [[Benjamin Outram]], although he was not the originator. This type of rail was known as the plate-rail, tramway-plate or way-plate, names that are preserved in the modern term "[[platelayer]]" applied to the workers who lay and maintain the [[permanent way]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The wheels of flangeway wagons were plain, but they could not operate on ordinary roads as the narrow rims would dig into the surface.

=== Edgeways ===
[[File:Chpr fishbelly.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Cast iron fishbelly edge rail manufactured by Outram at the [[Butterley Company]] ironworks for the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]] (1831). These are smooth edgerails for wheels with flanges.]]
Another form of rail, the [[rail profile|edge rail]], was first used by [[William Jessop]] on a line that was opened as part of the [[Charnwood Forest Canal]] between [[Loughborough]] and [[Nanpantan]] in [[Leicestershire]] in 1789.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; This line was originally designed as a plateway on the Outram system, but objections were laying raised to rails with upstanding ledges or flanges on the [[turnpike trust|turnpike]]. This difficulty was overcome by paving or "causewaying" the road up to the level of the top of the flanges.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In 1790, Jessop and his partner Outram began to manufacture edge-rails. Another example of the edge rail application was the [[Lake Lock Rail Road]] used primarily for coal transport. This was a public railway (charging a toll) and opened for traffic in 1798, making it the world's oldest public railway. The route started at Lake Lock, [[Stanley, West Yorkshire|Stanley]], on the [[Aire &amp; Calder Navigation]], running from [[Wakefield]] to [[Outwood, West Yorkshire|Outwood]], a distance of approximately {{convert|3|mi|km|1}}. Edge-rails (with a side rack) were used on the nearby [[Middleton Railway|Middleton-Leeds rack railway]] (a length of this rail is on display in [[Leeds City Museum]]). The wheels of an edgeway have flanges, like modern railways and tramways. Causewaying is also done on modern [[level crossing]]s and tramways.

These two systems of constructing iron railways continued to exist until the early 19th century.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In most parts of England the plate-rail was preferred.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Plate-rails were used on the [[Surrey Iron Railway]] (SIR), from [[Wandsworth]] to [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The SIR was sanctioned by Parliament in 1801 and finished in 1803.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Like the [[Lake Lock Rail Road]], the SIR was available to the public on payment of tolls; previous lines had all been private and reserved exclusively for the use of their owners.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Since it was used by individual operators, vehicles would vary greatly in wheel spacing ([[Rail gauge|gauge]]) and the plate rail coped better. In South [[Wales]] again, where in 1811 the railways were connected with canals, collieries, ironworks, and copper works, and had a total length of nearly {{convert|150|mi|km|0}},&lt;ref name="PMEM1844"/&gt; the plateway was almost universal.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; But in the North of England and in Scotland the edge-rail was held in greater favor, and soon its superiority was generally established.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Wheels tended to bind against the flange of the plate rail and mud and stones would build up.

[[File:Chpr rail.jpg|thumb|220px|Lengths of fishbelly rail on stone support blocks. These are edgerails for wheels with flanges.]]
The manufacture of the rails themselves was gradually improved.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; By making them in longer lengths, the number of joints per mile was reduced.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Joints were always the weakest part of the line.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Another advance was the substitution of wrought iron for cast iron, though that material did not gain wide adoption until after the patent for an improved method of rolling rails was granted in 1820 to [[John Birkinshaw]], of the [[Bedlington Ironworks]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; His rails were wedge-shaped in section, much wider at the top than at the bottom, with the intermediate portion or web thinner still. He recommended that they be made {{convert|18|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} long, suggesting that several might be welded together end to end to form considerable lengths. They were supported on sleepers by chairs at intervals of {{convert|3|ft|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on|round=5}}, and were fish-bellied between the support points.

== Steam power ==
[[File:TrevithicksEngine.jpg|thumb|A replica of Trevithick's engine at the [[National Waterfront Museum]], Swansea]]

In 1804, [[Richard Trevithick]], in the first recorded use of steam power on a railway, ran a high-pressure [[steam locomotive]] with smooth wheels on an 'L' section plateway near [[Merthyr Tydfil]], but it was more expensive than horses.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He made three trips from the iron mines at Penydarren to the Merthyr-Cardiff Canal and each time broke the rails that were designed for horse wagon loads. There was general doubt at the time that smooth wheels could obtain traction on smooth rails. This resulted in proposals using rack or other drive mechanisms.

[[File:Blenkinsop's rack locomotive, 1812 (British Railway Locomotives 1803-1853).jpg|thumb|left|The ''Salamanca'' locomotive]]
Mr Blenkinsop of Middleton Colliery patented the use of cogged wheels in 1811 and in 1812, the [[Middleton Railway]] (edgeway, rack rail) successfully used twin cylinder steam locomotives made by [[Matthew Murray]] of [[Holbeck]], [[Leeds]]. [[George Stephenson]] made his first steam locomotive in 1813 (patented 1815) for the [[Killingworth]] colliery,&lt;ref name="PMEM1844"/&gt; and found smooth wheels on smooth rails provided adequate grip. Although he later recounted that they called this locomotive 'My Lord' as it was financed by [[Thomas Liddell, 1st Baron Ravensworth|Lord Ravensworth]], it seems that it was known at the time as [[Killingworth locomotives#Blücher|Blücher]]. In 1814 William Stewart was engaged by Parkend Coal Co in the [[Forest of Dean]] for the construction of a steam locomotive, which when trialled was reported to be successful.&lt;ref name="PMEM1844"/&gt; Stewart did not receive his expected reward and the two parties parted on bad terms. Stewart was 'obliged to abandon the engine to that Company'.&lt;ref&gt;"Inventors and Capitalists", William Stewart, The Practical Mechanic and Engineer's Magazine, October 1844, p24&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821, a wagonway was proposed to connect the mines at [[Durham, England|West Durham]], [[Darlington]] and the [[River Tees]] at [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]], [[George Stephenson]] successfully argued that horse-drawn wagonways were obsolete and a steam-powered railway could carry 50 times as much coal. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}} In 1825 he built the locomotive ''[[Locomotion No 1|Locomotion]]'' for the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in England's northeast, which became the world's first public steam railway in 1825, via both horse power and steam power on different runs.

stationary steam engines for mining were generally available around the middle of the 18th century. Wagonways and steam-powered railways had steep uphill sections and would employ a cable powered by a stationary steam engine to work the inclined sections. British troops in Lewiston, New York used a cable wagonway to move supplies to bases before the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The Stockton and Darlington had two inclined sections powered by cable. The transition from a wagonway to a fully steam-powered railway was gradual. Railways up to the 1830s that were steam-powered often made runs with horses when the steam locomotives were unavailable. Even in the steam age, it was convenient to use horses in station yards to [[Shunting (rail)|shunt]] wagons from one place to another. Horses do not need lengthy times to raise steam in the boiler, and can take shortcuts from one siding to another. At [[Hamley Bridge]] tenders were called for the supply of horses, in part because normal railway staff lacked horse handling skills. 

== Pole road ==
[[File:"Perdido", a pole road locomotive.jpg|thumb|''Perdido'', a steam pole road locomotive]]
Wooden rails continued to be used for temporary railroads into the early twentieth century. Some timber harvesting companies in the southeastern [[United States]] created pole roads using unmarketable logs, which were effectively free, to create tracks at a cost of between $100 and $500 per mile. Permanence was not an issue, as the [[lumberjack]]s moved on to other stands of timber as each area was cleared.&lt;ref name="Trains_1948"&gt;"Pole Road Locomotives of the Early Days," ''[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]]'' magazine, February 1948&lt;/ref&gt; At least one such pole road system reportedly extended some 20 miles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escohis.org/atmore_alabama] {{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically the pole rails were logs of 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm) diameter, laid parallel directly on the ground without [[railroad tie|cross-ties]], and joined end-to-end with [[lap joint]]s and wooden pegs. [[Rolling stock]] typically had wheels either with concave treads that hugged the top of the pole rails, or un-flanged wheels with separate guide wheels running against the side of each rail. Steam [[traction engine]]s and some purpose-built locomotives were successfully used for hauling trains of logs. For example, ‘’Perdido’’ was built by Adams &amp; Price Locomotive and Machinery Works of [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1885 for the Wallace, Sanford and Company sawmill at [[Atmore, Alabama|Williams Station, Alabama]], where it hauled up to seven cars of 3 or 4 logs each. This was a geared engine (4.5 to 1 [[gear train|gear ratio]]), driving four individually-rotating concave-tread wheels on stationery axles via chain drives; powerful but running less than 5 miles per hour.&lt;ref name="Trains_1948"/&gt;

==Decline==

As steam power gradually replaced horse power, the term "wagonway" became obsolete and was superseded by the term "railway". In 2018, very few horse or cable freight railways, notable examples being the cable-hauled [[St Michael's Mount Tramway]] and the [[Reisszug]] - which has been in continuous operation since around 1500. A few passenger lines continue to operate, including the horse-hauled [[Douglas Bay Horse Tramway]] and the cable-hauled [[San Francisco cable cars]].

A '''watchdog timer''' (sometimes called a ''computer operating properly'' or ''COP'' timer, or simply a ''watchdog'') is an electronic [[timer]] that is used to detect and recover from computer malfunctions. During normal operation, the computer regularly resets the watchdog timer to prevent it from elapsing, or "timing out". If, due to a hardware fault or program error, the computer fails to reset the watchdog, the timer will elapse and generate a timeout signal. The timeout signal is used to initiate corrective action or actions. The corrective actions typically include placing the computer system in a safe state and restoring normal system operation.

Watchdog timers are commonly found in [[embedded system]]s and other computer-controlled equipment where humans cannot easily access the equipment or would be unable to react to faults in a timely manner. In such systems, the computer cannot depend on a human to invoke a reboot if it [[hang (computing)|hangs]]; it must be self-reliant. For example, remote embedded systems such as [[space probe]]s are not physically accessible to human operators; these could become permanently disabled if they were unable to autonomously recover from faults. A watchdog timer is usually employed in cases like these. Watchdog timers may also be used when running untrusted code in a [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]], to limit the CPU time available to the code and thus prevent some types of [[denial-of-service attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/grenade.pdf "The Grenade Timer: Fortifying the Watchdog Timer Against Malicious Mobile Code"] by Frank Stajano and Ross Anderson (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture and operation==

===Watchdog restart===
The act of restarting a watchdog timer, commonly referred to as "kicking" the watchdog&lt;ref name=ESD&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;, is typically done by writing to a watchdog control [[Memory-mapped I/O|port]]. Alternatively, in microcontrollers that have an integrated watchdog timer, the watchdog is sometimes kicked by executing a special [[machine language]] instruction. An example of this is the CLRWDT (clear watchdog timer) instruction found in the instruction set of some [[PIC microcontroller]]s.

In computers that are running [[operating system]]s, watchdog resets are usually invoked through a [[device driver]]. For example, in the [[Linux operating system]], a [[user space]] program will kick the watchdog by interacting with the watchdog device driver, typically by writing a zero character to &lt;tt&gt;/dev/watchdog&lt;/tt&gt;. The device driver, which serves to abstract the watchdog hardware from user space programs, is also used to configure the time-out period and start and stop the timer.

===Single-stage watchdog===
Watchdog timers come in many configurations, and many allow their configurations to be altered. [[Microcontroller]]s often include an integrated, on-chip watchdog. In other computers the watchdog may reside in a nearby chip that connects directly to the [[CPU]], or it may be located on an external [[expansion card]] in the computer's chassis. The watchdog and CPU may share a common [[clock signal]], as shown in the block diagram below, or they may have independent clock signals.

[[File:SimpleWatchdogTimer.gif|300px|center|alt=Block diagram of a simple, single-stage watchdog timer. The common clock is characteristic of basic watchdog microcontrollers.]]

===Multistage watchdog===
Two or more timers are sometimes cascaded to form a ''multistage watchdog timer'', where each timer is referred to as a ''timer stage'', or simply a ''stage''. For example, the block diagram below shows a three-stage watchdog. In a multistage watchdog, only the first stage is kicked by the processor. Upon first stage timeout, a corrective action is initiated and the next stage in the cascade is started. As each subsequent stage times out, it triggers a corrective action and starts the next stage. Upon final stage timeout, a corrective action is initiated, but no other stage is started because the end of the cascade has been reached. Typically, single-stage watchdog timers are used to simply restart the computer, whereas multistage watchdog timers will sequentially trigger a series of corrective actions, with the final stage triggering a computer restart.&lt;ref name=SMSWT /&gt;

[[File:Watchdog3stage.gif|550px|center|alt=A three-stage electronic watchdog timer.]]

===Time intervals===
Watchdog timers may have either fixed or programmable time intervals. Some watchdog timers allow the time interval to be programmed by selecting from among a few selectable, discrete values. In others, the interval can be programmed to arbitrary values. Typically, watchdog time intervals range from ten milliseconds to a minute or more. In a multistage watchdog, each timer may have its own, unique time interval.

==Corrective actions==
A watchdog timer may initiate any of several types of corrective action, including [[maskable interrupt]], [[non-maskable interrupt]], processor reset, [[fail-safe]] state activation, power cycling, or combinations of these. Depending on its architecture, the type of corrective action or actions that a watchdog can trigger may be fixed or programmable. Some computers (e.g., PC compatibles) require a pulsed signal to invoke a processor reset. In such cases, the watchdog typically triggers a processor reset by activating an internal or external pulse generator, which in turn creates the required reset pulses.&lt;ref name=SMSWT /&gt;

In embedded systems and control systems, watchdog timers are often used to activate [[fail-safe]] circuitry. When activated, the fail-safe circuitry forces all control outputs to safe states (e.g., turns off motors, heaters, and high-[[voltage]]s) to prevent injuries and equipment damage while the fault persists. In a two-stage watchdog, the first timer is often used to activate fail-safe outputs and start the second timer stage; the second stage will reset the computer if the fault cannot be corrected before the timer elapses.

Watchdog timers are sometimes used to trigger the recording of system state information—which may be useful during fault recovery&lt;ref name=SMSWT /&gt;—or [[debug]] information (which may be useful for determining the cause of the fault) onto a [[persistence (computer science)|persistent]] medium. In such cases, a second timer—which is started when the first timer elapses—is typically used to reset the computer later, after allowing sufficient time for data recording to complete. This allows time for the information to be saved, but ensures that the computer will be reset even if the recording process fails.

[[File:WatchdogNmiReset.gif|500px|center|alt=Two-stage watchdog timer]]

For example, the above diagram shows a likely configuration for a two-stage watchdog timer. During normal operation the computer regularly kicks Stage1 to prevent a timeout. If the computer fails to kick Stage1 (e.g., due to a hardware fault or programming error), Stage1 will eventually timeout. This event will start the Stage2 timer and, simultaneously, notify the computer (by means of a non-maskable interrupt) that a reset is imminent. Until Stage2 times out, the computer may attempt to record state information, debug information, or both. The computer will be reset upon Stage2 timeout.

==Fault detection==
A computer system is typically designed so that its watchdog timer will be kicked only if the computer deems the system functional. The computer determines whether the system is functional by conducting one or more fault detection tests and it will kick the watchdog only if all tests have passed. In computers that are running an operating system and [[Process (computing)|multiple processes]], a single, simple test may be insufficient to guarantee normal operation, as it could fail to detect a subtle fault condition and therefore allow the watchdog to be kicked even though a fault condition exists.

For example, in the case of the Linux operating system, a user-space watchdog [[Daemon (computing)|daemon]] may simply kick the watchdog periodically without performing any tests. As long as the daemon runs normally, the system will be protected against serious system crashes such as a [[kernel panic]]. To detect less severe faults, the daemon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://linux.die.net/man/8/watchdog|title = Watchdog 'man' page|accessdate = 10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be configured to perform tests that cover resource availability (e.g., sufficient [[Computer memory|memory]] and [[file handles]], reasonable CPU time), evidence of expected process activity (e.g., system daemons running, specific files being present or updated), overheating, and network activity, and system-specific test scripts or programs may also be run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sat.dundee.ac.uk/~psc/watchdog/watchdog-general-tests.html|title = Linux Watchdog - General Tests|accessdate = 10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon discovery of a failed test, the Linux watchdog daemon may attempt to perform a software-initiated restart, which can be preferable to a hardware reset as the file systems will be safely [[Mount (computing)|unmounted]] and fault information will be logged. However it is essential to have the insurance of the hardware timer as a software restart can fail under a number of fault conditions. In effect, this is a dual-stage watchdog with the software restart comprising the first stage and the hardware reset the second stage.
