The '''A3220''' is a [[primary status|primary]] [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]] in [[London]]. It runs north from [[Clapham Common]] to the [[A40 road|A40]] [[Westway (London)|Westway]] at [[Ladbroke Grove]]. 

The road crosses the [[River Thames]] at [[Battersea Bridge]]. Turning left at the northern end of the bridge, the A3220 follows the northern bank of the Thames for some 500 m before swinging northwestward and becoming two separate roads as part of a [[One-way traffic|one-way system]]. 500 m after crossing the [[A315 road|A315]], the route returns to being a standard bidirectional [[single carriageway|single-carriageway]] road for some 750 m as far as the [[Holland Park]] roundabout, from where it forms the [[dual carriageway|dual-carriageway]] [[West Cross Route]], formerly the M41 motorway.

The '''A466''', also known as the '''Wye Valley Road''', is a road from [[Hereford]], [[England]] to [[Chepstow]], [[Wales]] via [[Monmouth]], [[Tintern]] and the [[Wye Valley]].

The road was largely developed during the late 18th and early 19th centuries by [[turnpike trust]]s in Herefordshire and Monmouthshire.  It replaced the [[River Wye]] as the principal means of transport to Tintern before the construction of the [[Wye Valley Railway]] in the late 19th century. The A466 remains an important route for local residents and tourists, and now provides access to the old [[Severn Bridge]] on the [[M48 motorway]].

==Route==
The A466 is about {{convert|30|miles}} long and runs through the counties of [[Herefordshire]] and [[Gloucestershire]] in England, and [[Monmouthshire]] in Wales. It runs south from [[Kingsthorne]], on the [[A49 road|A49]] south east of [[Hereford]] to [[Monmouth]], crossing the [[A40 road|A40]]. After crossing the [[River Wye]] at the [[Wye Bridge, Monmouth]] and [[Bigsweir Bridge]] near [[Llandogo]], it follows a picturesque route south down the [[Wye valley]] through [[Tintern]] and Chepstow to the [[M48 motorway]] at junction 2. The road crosses the [[England–Wales border|border between England and Wales]] at three places along its length: at [[Buckholt, Monmouthshire |Buckholt]], [[Redbrook]], and [[Bigsweir]].&lt;ref name=map&gt;{{cite web |url=https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?saddr=Wye+Valley+Link+Rd,+Chepstow,+Monmouthshire+NP16,+UK&amp;daddr=51.8637125,-2.7327553+to:A466&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.629952,-2.68796&amp;spn=0.029942,0.077591&amp;sll=51.987074,-2.734823&amp;sspn=0.003713,0.009699&amp;geocode=FamuEwMdfDTX_ylXzFwAEJVxSDHIue4IRamm_Q%3BFaBgFwMdLU3W_ymL3DrbKrZxSDG8g2irLpCyww%3BFdxEGQMdK0TW_w&amp;t=h&amp;mra=mift&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=17&amp;z=14&amp;via=1 |title=Directions to A466 |publisher=[[Google Maps]] |accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It runs through an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], and is popular with tourists, offering good views of the area around the Wye valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wyedeantourism.co.uk/discover/Things%20to%20do/i-4491-Wyndcliff_and_Eagles_Nest|title=Wyndcliff and Eagles Nest|publisher=Wye and Dean Tourism|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitwales.com/explore/south-wales/wye-valley-vale-usk/explore-aonb-river|title=Sun-dappled trails: exploring the Wye Valley AONB|publisher=Visit Wales|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the road is maintained by the respective county councils except for the southernmost section from Chepstow to the M48, which is a [[trunk road]] and funded by the [[National Assembly for Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.wales/docs/det/general/140313-trunk-roads-map-en.pdf?lang=en|title=Trunk Roads Map|publisher=National Assembly for Wales|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Turnpikes===
Between Kingsthorne and Monmouth, the road passes through open countryside several miles to the west of the River Wye, and the villages of [[Wormelow Tump]], [[St Weonards]], [[Llancloudy]] and [[Welsh Newton]].  This part of the road was turnpiked incrementally in short stages in the late eighteenth century and became known as "The Great Road to the Town of Monmouth". The initial turnpike in 1730 ran as far as [[St Weonards]], and was extended to [[Llancloudy]] in 1769. A [[toll house|tollhouse]] survives at Monkgate, Monmouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hurley |first=Heather |date=2007 |title= Trackway to Turnpike: The Old Roads of South Herefordshire|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jTaWk2RsMNEC&amp;dq=monkgate+monmouth+tollhouse |location=Ross-on-Wye |publisher=Fineleaf Editions |pages=35, 45–47 |isbn=978-0-9534437-4-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wye Bridge at Monmouth has existed in one form or another since the [[Middle Ages]]. The current bridge was built in 1879 by Edwin Seward of Cardiff from red and bluff sandstone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ggat.org.uk/cadw/historic_landscape/wye_valley/english/wyevalley_035.htm|title=Lower Wye Valley|publisher=Glamorgan and Gwent Historical Society|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

After crossing the river at Monmouth, the road passes through [[Redbrook]], [[Llandogo]], [[Tintern]] and [[St Arvans]], in the deeply incised river valley, before reaching [[Chepstow Racecourse]] and the town of Chepstow.  Until the early nineteenth century, the road between Chepstow and Monmouth passed through St Arvans, [[Devauden]] and [[Trellech]] (the current B4293); the riverside villages of Llandogo, [[Brockweir]] and Tintern, with their associated [[Wye Tour|tourism]], metalworking and shipbuilding industries, were more easily accessed by river.  The route between Monmouth and Redbrook was part of the main road between Monmouth and [[Coleford, Gloucestershire|Coleford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/glos/vol5/pp195-231|title=Victoria County History – Gloucestershire|work=A History of the County of Gloucester|volume=5, Bledisloe Hundred, St. Briavels Hundred, the Forest of Dean|pp=195–231|publisher=British History Online|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The road between Crossway Green, just north of Chepstow, and St Arvans was improved soon after 1760 by [[Valentine Morris]], the owner of the adjoining [[Piercefield House|Piercefield]] estate, and again around 1800 by its subsequent owner [[Sir Mark Wood, 1st Baronet |Mark Wood]].  In about 1809, proposals were made to cut a new road along the valley, to improve access to Tintern in particular.  Little progress was made until 1824, when legislation was passed "for Making a Turnpike Road from Redbrook to St Arvans" and a bridge at Bigsweir, under the authority of the Monmouth Turnpike Trust.  The new road was constructed between St Arvans and Tintern in 1825, and by 1829 the road had been opened along its whole length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waters |first=Ivor |date=1955|title=Chepstow Parish Records |location=Chepstow |publisher=The Chepstow Society |pages=112–113|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kBhIAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=chepstow+parish+records&amp;dq=chepstow+parish+records}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bigsweir Bridge was opened in 1827 as part of the new road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=23262|title=Victoria County History – Gloucestershire|work=A History of the County of Gloucester|volume=5, Bledisloe Hundred, St. Briavels Hundred, the Forest of Dean|pp=247–271|publisher=British History Online|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Two turnpike houses from this period are still standing; one at St Arvans is Grade II listed, while another is by Bigsweir Bridge.&lt;ref name=blb1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-24767-milestone-on-the-a466-at-the-foot-of-the-#.V8NJj_krJmM|title=Milestone on the A466 at the foot of the Wyndcliff, St Arvans|publisher=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blb2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-24757-turnpike-cottage-st-arvans#.V8NH9fkrJmM|title=Turnpike Cottage, St Arvans|publisher=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The trusts were wound up in 1873, with control ultimately passing to the relevant county councils.&lt;ref name=blb2/&gt;  The turnpike was superseded in 1876 by the [[Wye Valley Railway]], which led to a huge increase in tourist traffic to the valley and Tintern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ggat.org.uk/cadw/historic_landscape/wye_valley/english/wyevalley_013.htm|title=Lower Wye Valley|publisher=Glamorgan and Gwent Architectural trust|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motor traffic===
The southernmost section of the A466 is the Wye Valley Link Road, which was a project built in conjunction with the first [[Severn Bridge]]. It opened to traffic in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1963/may/08/road-programme-schemes#S5CV0677P0_19630508_CWA_46|title=Road Programmes (Schemes)|work=Hansard|date=8 May 1963|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of the road north of this is under local government control; the [[Ministry of Transport]] dismissed calls in the late 1960s for them to improve the road to deal with increasing congestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1968/mar/18/a466-road-wye-valley#S5CV0761P0_19680318_CWA_151|title=A466 Road (Wye Valley)|work=Hansard|date=18 March 1968|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1969/apr/14/wye-valley-road#S5CV0781P0_19690414_CWA_213|title=Wye Valley Road|work=Hansard|date=14 April 1969|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Akihiro Kusumi'''|楠見 明弘|Kusumi Akihiro}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[biologist]] who proposed an explanation for reduced diffusion speed of [[lipid]] and [[protein]] molecules in the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] membrane, based on a model of hop diffusion in which lipids are confined to a reduced space, created by a membrane-skeleton-induced compartments. this compartments allow the lipids or proteins freely in a limited region and limiting also the diffusion to other parts of the membrane. Getting to a new compartment is called "[[hop diffusion]]" while diffusion in the compartment is allowed by Brownian movement, the compartments of the cell are responsible of the reduced diffusion speed of the lipid or proteins when compared to artificial [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Paradigm shift of the plasma membrane concept from the two-dimensional continuum fluid to the partitioned fluid: high-speed single-molecule tracking of membrane molecules.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4102">{{About|the physiological principle|the finance term|All or none|the mathematical term|Zero–one law}}

The '''all-or-none law''' is the principle that the strength by which a [[nerve]] or [[Skeletal striated muscle|muscle fibre]] responds to a stimulus is independent of the strength of the stimulus. If that stimulus exceeds the [[threshold potential]], the nerve or muscle fibre will give a complete response; otherwise, there is no response. 

It was first established by the American physiologist [[Henry Pickering Bowditch]] in 1871 for the [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] of [[Cardiac muscle|heart muscle]]. According to him, describing the relation of response to stimulus,&lt;blockquote&gt;““An induction shock produces a contraction or fails to do so according to its strength; if it does so at all, it produces the greatest contraction that can be produced by any strength of stimulus in the condition of the muscle at the time.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;The individual fibres of both [[skeletal muscle]] and nerve respond to stimulation according to the all-or-none principle.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, Walter B. ''Biographical Memoir, Henry Pickering Bowditch, 1840–1911''. Washington, D.C.: [[National Academy of Sciences]], Volume xvii, eighth memoir. 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship between stimulus and response==
The magnitude of the [[action potential]] set up in any single [[nerve fibre]] is independent of the strength of the exciting stimulus, provided the latter is adequate. An [[Electrical muscle stimulation|electrical stimulus]] below threshold strength fails to elicit a propagated spike potential. If it is of threshold strength or over, a spike (a nervous impulse) of maximum magnitude is set up. Either the single fibre does not respond with spike production, or it responds to the utmost of its ability under the conditions at the moment. This property of the single nerve fibre is termed the all-or-none relationship. This relationship holds only for the unit of [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]; for [[nervous tissue]] the unit is the [[nerve cell]], for [[skeletal muscle]] the unit is the individual muscle fiber and for the heart the unit is the entire [[Atrium (heart)|auricles]] or the entire [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s.

Stimuli too weak to produce a spike do, however, set up a local [[Electrotonic potential|electrotonus]], the magnitude of the electronic potential progressively increasing with the strength of the stimulus, until a spike is generated. This demonstrates the all-or-none relationship in spike production.

The above account deals with the response of a single nerve fibre. If a [[Sympathetic trunk|nerve trunk]] is stimulated, then as the exciting stimulus is progressively increased above a threshold, a larger number of fibres respond. The minimal effective (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;[[Threshold potential|threshold]]) stimulus is adequate only for fibres of high excitability, but a stronger stimulus excites all the nerve fibres. Increasing the stimulus further does increase the response of whole nerve.

[[Cardiac muscle|Heart muscle]] is excitable, i.e., it responds to external stimuli by [[Muscle contraction|contracting]]. If the external stimulus is too weak, no response is obtained; if the stimulus is adequate, the heart responds to the best of its ability. Accordingly, the [[Atrium (heart)|auricles]] or [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s behave as a single unit, so that an adequate stimulus normally produces a full contraction of either the auricles or ventricles. The force of the contraction obtained depends on the state in which the muscles fibres find themselves. In the case of [[muscle fibre]]s, the individual muscle fibre does not respond at all if the stimulus is too weak. However, it responds maximally when the stimulus rises to threshold. The contraction is not increased if the stimulus strength is further raised. Stronger stimuli bring more muscle fibres into action and thus the tension of a muscle increases as the strength of the stimulus applied to it rises.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1489">'''Asset turnover''' ('''ATO''') is a [[financial ratio]] that measures the efficiency of a company's use of its [[asset]]s in generating sales revenue or sales income to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Bodie |first = Zane |author2=Alex Kane |author3=Alan J. Marcus |title = Essentials of Investments, 5th ed |publisher = McGraw-Hill Irwin |date = 2004 |isbn = 0-07-251077-3 |page =459 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies with low profit margins tend to have high asset turnover, while those with high profit margins have low asset turnover. Companies in the retail industry tend to have a very high turnover ratio due mainly to cutthroat and competitive pricing.

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Asset Turnover} = \frac{\mbox{Net Sales Revenue}}{\mbox{Average Total Assets}}&lt;/math&gt;

* "Sales" is the value of "Net Sales" or "Sales" from the company's [[income statement]]
* "Average Total Assets" is the average of the values of "Total assets" from the company's [[balance sheet]] in the beginning and the end of the fiscal period. It is calculated by adding up the assets at the beginning of the period and the assets at the end of the period, then dividing that number by two. This method can produce unreliable results for businesses that experience significant intra-year fluctuations. For such businesses it is advisable to use some other formula for Average Total Assets.
* Alternatively, "Average Total Assets" can be ending total assets.

Neither the [[Standard Model|standard model]] of [[particle physics]], nor the theory of [[general relativity]] provides a known explanation for why this should be so, and it is a natural assumption that the universe be neutral with all conserved [[charge (physics)|charge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Particle and astroparticle physics |first=Utpal |last=Sarkar |pages=429 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=1-58488-931-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Big Bang]] should have produced equal amounts of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]]. Since this does not seem to have been the case, it is likely some physical laws must have acted differently or did not exist for [[matter]] and [[antimatter]].
Several competing hypotheses exist to explain the imbalance of matter and antimatter that resulted in [[baryogenesis]]. However, there is as of yet no consensus theory to explain the phenomenon. As remarked in a 2012 research paper, "The origin of matter remains one of the great mysteries in physics."&lt;ref name=MatterAndAntimatterInTheUniverse/&gt;

* [[Baryon number]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; violation.
* [[C-symmetry]] and [[CP-symmetry]] violation.
* Interactions out of [[thermal equilibrium]].

===Baryon number violation===
Baryon number violation is obviously a necessary condition to produce an excess of baryons over anti-baryons. But C-symmetry violation is also needed so that the interactions which produce more baryons than anti-baryons will not be counterbalanced by interactions which produce more anti-baryons than baryons. CP-symmetry violation is similarly required because otherwise equal numbers of [[Chirality (physics)#Chirality and helicity|left-handed]]  baryons and [[Chirality (physics)#Chirality and helicity|right-handed]] anti-baryons would be produced, as well as equal numbers of left-handed anti-baryons and right-handed baryons. Finally, the interactions must be out of thermal equilibrium, since otherwise [[CPT symmetry]] would assure compensation between processes increasing and decreasing the baryon number.&lt;ref name=FarrarShaposhnikov1993&gt;

Currently, there is no experimental evidence of particle interactions where the conservation of baryon number is broken [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbatively]]: this would appear to suggest that all observed particle reactions have equal baryon number before and after. Mathematically, the [[commutator]] of the baryon number [[operator (mathematics)|quantum operator]] with the (perturbative) [[Standard Model]] [[hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|hamiltonian]] is zero: &lt;math&gt;[B,H] = BH - HB = 0&lt;/math&gt;. However, the Standard Model is known to violate the conservation of baryon number only non-perturbatively: a global U(1) anomaly. To account for baryon violation in baryogenesis, such events (including proton decay) can occur in [[Grand unification theory|Grand Unification Theories]] (GUTs) and [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] (SUSY) models via hypothetical massive bosons such as the [[X and Y bosons|X boson]].

===CP-Symmetry Violation===
{{Main|CP violation}}
The second condition for generating baryon asymmetry&amp;nbsp;– violation of charge-parity symmetry&amp;nbsp;– is that a process is able to happen at a different rate to its antimatter counterpart. In the [[Standard Model]], CP violation appears as a complex phase in the [[CKM matrix|quark mixing matrix]] of the [[weak interaction]]. There may also be a non-zero CP-violating phase in the [[PMNS matrix|neutrino mixing matrix]], but this is currently unmeasured. CP violation was first observed in the 1964 [[Fitch-Cronin experiment]] with neutral [[kaon]]s, which resulted in the 1980 [[Nobel Prize in physics]] (direct CP-violation, that is violation of CP-symmetry in a decay process, was discovered later, in 1999). Due to CPT symmetry, violation of CP-symmetry demands violation of time inversion symmetry, or [[T-symmetry]].  Despite the allowance for CP-violation in the Standard Model, it is insufficient to account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe given the limits on baryon number violation, meaning that [[Physics beyond the Standard Model|beyond-Standard Model]] sources are needed.

A possible new source of CP violation was found at the [[Large Hadron Collider|Large Hadron Collider (LHC)]] by the [[LHCb experiment|LHCb]] collaboration during the first three years of LHC operations (beginning March 2010). The experiment analyzed the decays of two particles, the [[Lambda baryon|bottom Lambda]] (Λ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) and its antiparticle, and compared the distributions of decay products. The data showed an asymmetry of up to 20% of CP-violation sensitive quantities, implying a breaking of CP-symmetry. This analysis will need to be confirmed by more data from subsequent runs of the LHC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://home.cern/about/updates/2017/01/new-source-asymmetry-between-matter-and-antimatter|title=New source of asymmetry between matter and antimatter {{!}} CERN|website=home.cern|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interactions out of thermal equilibrium===
In the out-of-equilibrium decay scenario,&lt;ref name=Riotto99&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author1=A. Riotto |author2=M. Trodden | year = 1999
 | title = Recent progress in baryogenesis
 | journal = [[Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science]]
 | volume = 49 | pages = 46
 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.nucl.49.1.35
|arxiv = hep-ph/9901362 |bibcode = 1999ARNPS..49...35R }}&lt;/ref&gt; the last condition states that the rate of a reaction which generates baryon-asymmetry must be less than the rate of expansion of the universe. In this situation the particles and their corresponding antiparticles do not achieve thermal equilibrium due to rapid expansion decreasing the occurrence of pair-annihilation.

==Other explanations==
===Regions of the universe where antimatter dominates===
Another possible explanation of the apparent baryon asymmetry is that matter and antimatter are essentially separated into different, widely separated regions of the [[universe]]. The formation of antimatter galaxies was originally thought to explain the baryon asymmetry, as from a distance, antimatter atoms are indistinguishable from matter atoms; both produce light (photons) in the same way. Along the boundary between matter and antimatter regions, however, annihilation (and the subsequent production of [[gamma radiation]]) would be detectable, depending on its distance and the density of matter and antimatter. Such boundaries, if they exist, would likely lie in deep intergalactic space. The density of matter in intergalactic space is reasonably well established at about one atom per cubic meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Keay |last2=Smoot |first2=George |author2link=George Smoot |title=Wrinkles in Time |publisher=Avon |location=New York |year=2008 |isbn=0061344443 |pages=158–163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silk |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Silk |title=Big Bang |location=New York |publisher=Freeman |year=1977 |page=299 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XLwe1lUmz5kC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming this is a typical density near a boundary, the gamma ray luminosity of the boundary interaction zone can be calculated. No such zones have been detected, but 30 years of research have placed bounds on how far they might be. On the basis of such analyses, it is now deemed unlikely that any region within the observable universe is dominated by antimatter.&lt;ref name=MatterAndAntimatterInTheUniverse&gt;{{cite journal|first=L. |last=Canetti |first2=M. |last2=Drewes |first3=M. |last3=Shaposhnikov |title=Matter and Antimatter in the Universe |journal=New J. Phys. |year=2012 |volume=14 |pages=095012 |doi=10.1088/1367-2630/14/9/095012 |arxiv = 1204.4186 |bibcode = 2012NJPh...14i5012C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One attempt to explain the lack of observable interfaces between matter and antimatter dominated regions is that they are separated by a [[Leidenfrost effect|Leidenfrost]] layer of very hot matter created by the energy released from annihilation. This is similar to the manner in which water may be separated from a hot plate by a layer of evaporated vapor, delaying the evaporation of more water.

===Electric dipole moment===
The presence of an [[electric dipole moment]] (EDM) in any fundamental particle would violate both parity (P) and time (T) symmetries. As such, an EDM would allow matter and antimatter to decay at different rates leading to a possible matter-antimatter asymmetry as observed today. Many experiments are currently being conducted to measure the EDM of various physical particles. All measurements are currently consistent with no dipole moment. However, the results do place rigorous constraints on the amount of symmetry violation that a physical model can permit. The most recent EDM limit, published in 2014, was that of the ACME Collaboration, which measured the EDM of the electron using a pulsed beam of [[thorium monoxide]] (ThO) molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The ACME Collaboration |title=Order of Magnitude Smaller Limit on the Electric Dipole Moment of the Electron |journal=Science |volume=343 |issue=269 |pages=269–72 |date=17 January 2014 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6168/269.full |doi=10.1126/science.1248213 |display-authors=etal |pmid=24356114|bibcode = 2014Sci...343..269B |arxiv=1310.7534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baryon asymmetry parameter==
The challenges to the physics theories are then to explain ''how'' to produce this preference of matter over antimatter, and also the ''magnitude'' of this asymmetry. An important quantifier is the ''asymmetry parameter'',
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{n_B - n_{\bar B}}{n_\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;.
This quantity relates the overall number density difference between baryons and antibaryons (n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;{{overline|B}}&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively) and the number density of [[cosmic background radiation]] [[photon]]s n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;.

According to the Big Bang model, matter decoupled from the [[cosmic background radiation]] (CBR) at a temperature of roughly {{val|3000}} [[kelvin]], corresponding to an average kinetic energy of {{val|3000|u=K}} / ({{val|10.08|e=3|u=K/eV}}) = {{val|0.3|u=eV}}. After the decoupling, the ''total'' number of CBR photons remains constant. Therefore, due to space-time expansion, the photon density decreases. The photon density at equilibrium temperature T per cubic centimeter, is given by
:&lt;math&gt;n_\gamma = \frac{1}{\pi^2} {\left(\frac{k_B T}{\hbar c}\right)}^3 \int_0^\infty \frac{x^2}{e^x - 1} dx =
  \frac{2\zeta(3)}{\pi^2}{\left(\frac{k_B T}{\hbar c}\right)}^3 \approx
  20.3 \left(\frac{T}{1\text{K}}\right)^3 \text{cm}^{-3}
&lt;/math&gt;,
with k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; as the [[Boltzmann constant]], ħ as the [[Planck constant]] divided by 2π and c as the speed of light in vacuum, and ζ(3) as
[[Apéry's constant]]. At the current CBR photon temperature of {{val|2.725|u=K}}, this corresponds to a photon density n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; of around 411 CBR photons per cubic centimeter.

Therefore, the asymmetry parameter η, as defined above, is ''not'' the "good" parameter. Instead, the preferred asymmetry parameter uses the [[entropy]] density s,
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_s = \frac{n_B - n_{\bar B}}{s}&lt;/math&gt;
because the entropy density of the universe remained reasonably constant throughout most of its evolution. The entropy density is
:&lt;math&gt;s \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{\mathrm{entropy}}{\mathrm{volume}} = \frac{p + \rho}{T} = \frac{2\pi^2}{45}g_{*}(T) T^3&lt;/math&gt;
with p and ρ as the pressure and density from the energy density tensor T&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;, and g&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; as the effective number of degrees of freedom for "massless" particles (inasmuch as mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≪ k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T holds) at temperature T,
:&lt;math&gt;g_*(T) = \sum_\mathrm{i=bosons} g_i{\left(\frac{T_i}{T}\right)}^3 + \frac{7}{8}\sum_\mathrm{j=fermions} g_j{\left(\frac{T_j}{T}\right)}^3&lt;/math&gt;,
for bosons and fermions with g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and g&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; degrees of freedom at temperatures T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; respectively. At the present era, s = {{val|7.04|s=n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

'''Bovine herpesvirus 5''' is a [[virus species]] of the genus ''[[Varicellovirus]]'' and subfamily [[Alphaherpesvirinae]]. It causes [[meningoencephalitis]] and [[bovine respiratory disease|respiratory disease]] in cattle and sheep. As with all herpes viruses latent infection can occur, with recrudescence  at times of stressed and/or immunosuppression. Sites of latency include the CNS and mucosae of the nose and trachea. The disease has been documented in South America, the United States, Australia, Germany and Hungary. Caused by: '''''BHV-5 — Bovine Encephalitis Virus — Bovine Encephalitis Herpesvirus'''''

Disease is most common in calves up to ten months of age.

==Clinical signs and diagnosis==
Signs of respiratory disease include [[tachycardia]] and [[tachypnea]] with [[pyrexia]], [[dyspnea]], mucoid nasal discharge, [[hypersalivation]] and abnormal lung sounds. Systemic signs such as lethargy and [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] are seen.

Neurological signs are normally acute. These signs include [[opisthotonus]], [[hyperaesthesia]], abnormal behaviour, [[ataxia]], [[head pressing]], [[blindness]], [[proprioception|proprioceptive deficits]], coma and [[seizures]]. Sudden death occurs in neonates. Subacute disease almost always fatal, causing depression, anorexia, ataxia and a pronounced dyspnea.

Animals that recover from the infection or become infected following [[BHV-1]] infection become latent carriers.

To diagnose infection, the virus is identified using specific monoclonal antibodies, [[PCR]] or [[ELISA]]. Neurological lesions should be identifiable on [[autopsy|postmortem examination]].

==Treatment and control==
There is currently no treatment or specific vaccine for BHV-5, but [[BHV-1]] vaccines seem to provide some cross-protection.

The '''centimetre–gram–second system of units''' (abbreviated '''CGS''' or '''cgs''') is a variant of the [[metric system]] based on the [[centimetre]] as the unit of [[length]], the [[gram]] as the unit of [[mass]], and the [[second]] as the unit of [[time]]. All CGS [[mechanics|mechanical]] units are unambiguously derived from these three base units, but there are several different ways of extending the CGS system to cover [[electromagnetism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/centimetre-gram-second-system|title=Centimetre-gram-second system {{!}} physics|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}{{failed verification|date=April 2018|reason=article is about viscosity, not electromagnetism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/maple/view.aspx?path=Units/CGS|title=The Centimeter-Gram-Second (CGS) System of Units - Maple Programming Help|website=www.maplesoft.com|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1506/1506.01951.pdf | title = Babel of units: The evolution of units systems in classical electromagnetism | access-date = 31 March 2018 | last = Carron | first = Neal J.| date = 21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CGS system has been largely supplanted by the [[MKS system of units|MKS system]] based on the [[metre]], [[kilogram]], and second, which was in turn extended and replaced by the [[International System of Units]] (SI). In many fields of science and engineering, SI is the only system of units in use but there remain certain subfields where CGS is prevalent.

In measurements of purely mechanical systems (involving units of length, mass, [[force]], [[energy]], [[pressure]], and so on), the differences between CGS and SI are straightforward and rather trivial; the [[Unit conversion|unit-conversion factors]] are all [[Exponentiation#Powers of ten|powers of 10]] as {{nowrap|1=100 cm = 1 m}} and {{nowrap|1=1000 g = 1 kg}}. For example, the CGS unit of force is the [[dyne]] which is defined as {{nowrap|1=1 g⋅cm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, so the SI unit of force, the [[newton (unit)|newton]] ({{nowrap|1=1 kg⋅m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}), is equal to 100,000 dynes.

On the other hand, in measurements of electromagnetic phenomena (involving units of [[charge (physics)|charge]], electric and magnetic fields, [[voltage]], and so on), converting between CGS and SI is more subtle. Formulas for physical laws of electromagnetism (such as [[Maxwell's equations]]) need to be adjusted depending on which system of units one uses. This is because there is no [[one-to-one correspondence]] between electromagnetic units in SI and those in CGS, as is the case for mechanical units. Furthermore, within CGS, there are several plausible choices of electromagnetic units, leading to different unit "sub-systems", including [[Gaussian units]], "ESU", "EMU", and [[Lorentz–Heaviside units]]. Among these choices, Gaussian units are the most common today, and  "CGS units" often used   specifically refers to CGS-Gaussian units.

==History==
The CGS system goes back to a proposal in 1832 by the German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] to base a system of absolute units on the three fundamental units of length, mass and time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = C. F. | last = Gauss| authorlink = Carl Friedrich Gauss | title = Intensitas vis magneticae terrestris ad mensuram absolutam revocata | journal = Commentationes Societatis Regiae Scientiarum Gottingensis Recentiores | volume = 8 | year = 1832 | pages = 3–44}}. [http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/translations/gaussMagnetic.pdf English translation].&lt;/ref&gt;  Gauss chose the units of millimetre, milligram and second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, including British physicists [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] recommended the general adoption of centimetre, gram and second as fundamental units, and to express all derived electromagnetic units in these fundamental units, using the prefix "C.G.S. unit of ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

The sizes of many CGS units turned out to be inconvenient for practical purposes. For example, many everyday objects are hundreds or thousands of centimetres long, such as humans, rooms and buildings. Thus the CGS system never gained wide general use outside the field of science. Starting in the 1880s, and more significantly by the mid-20th century, CGS was gradually superseded internationally for scientific purposes by the MKS (metre–kilogram–second) system, which in turn developed into the modern [[SI]] standard.

Since the international adoption of the MKS standard in the 1940s and the SI standard in the 1960s, the technical use of CGS units has gradually declined worldwide, in the United States more slowly than elsewhere. CGS units are today no longer accepted by the house styles of most scientific journals, textbook publishers, or standards bodies, although they are commonly used in astronomical journals such as ''[[The Astrophysical Journal]]''. CGS units are still occasionally encountered in technical literature, especially in the United States in the fields of [[material science]], [[electrodynamics]] and [[astronomy]]. The continued usage of CGS units is most prevalent in magnetism and related fields because the B and H fields have the same units in free space and there is a lot of potential for confusion when converting published measurements from cgs to MKS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=L. H.|last2=Page|first2=C. H.|last3=Swartzendruber|first3=L.

The units [[gram]] and [[centimetre]] remain useful ''as [[Metric prefix|prefix]]ed units'' within the SI system, especially for instructional physics and chemistry experiments, where they match the small scale of table-top setups. However, where [[SI derived unit|derived unit]]s are needed, the SI ones are generally used and taught instead of the CGS ones today. For example, a physics lab course might ask students to record lengths in centimetres, and masses in grams, but force (a derived unit) in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s, a usage consistent with the SI system.

==Definition of CGS units in mechanics==
In mechanics, the CGS and SI systems of units are built in an identical way. The two systems differ only in the scale of two out of the three base units (centimetre versus metre and gram versus kilogram, respectively), while the third unit (second as the unit of time) is the same in both systems.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between the base units of mechanics in CGS and SI, and the laws of mechanics are not affected by the choice of units. The definitions of all [[derived unit]]s in terms of the three base units are therefore the same in both systems, and there is an unambiguous one-to-one correspondence of derived units:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; (definition of [[velocity]])
:&lt;math&gt;F=m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; ([[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]])
:&lt;math&gt;E = \int \vec{F}\cdot \mathrm{d\,}\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; ([[energy]] defined in terms of [[Mechanical work|work]])
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{F}{L^2} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; ([[pressure]] defined as force per unit area)
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \tau/\frac{dv}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; (dynamic [[viscosity]] defined as [[shear stress]] per unit velocity [[gradient]]).

Thus, for example, the CGS unit of pressure, [[barye]], is related to the CGS base units of length, mass, and time in the same way as the SI unit of pressure, [[pascal (unit)|pascal]], is related to the SI base units of length, mass, and time:

:1&amp;nbsp;unit of pressure = 1&amp;nbsp;unit of force/(1&amp;nbsp;unit of length)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1&amp;nbsp;unit of mass/(1&amp;nbsp;unit of length⋅(1&amp;nbsp;unit of time)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:1 Ba = 1 g/(cm⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:1 Pa = 1&amp;nbsp;kg/(m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Expressing a CGS derived unit in terms of the SI base units, or vice versa, requires combining the scale factors that relate the two systems:

:1 Ba = 1 g/(cm⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; kg/(10&lt;sup&gt;−2 &lt;/sup&gt;m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kg/(m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Pa.

==Derivation of CGS units in electromagnetism==

===CGS approach to electromagnetic units===
The conversion factors relating [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] units in the CGS and SI systems are made more complex by the differences in the formulae expressing physical laws of electromagnetism as assumed by each system of units, specifically in the nature of the constants that appear in these formulae. This illustrates the fundamental difference in the ways the two systems are built: 
* In SI, the unit of [[electric current]], the ampere (A), was historically defined such that the [[magnetism|magnetic]] force exerted by two infinitely long, thin, parallel wires 1 [[metre]] apart and carrying a current of 1 [[ampere]] is exactly 2×10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[newton (unit)|N]]/[[metre|m]]. This definition results in all [[International System of Units#Derived units|SI electromagnetic units]] being consistent (subject to factors of some [[integer]] powers of 10) with the EMU CGS system described in further sections. The ampere is a base unit of the SI system, with the same status as the metre, kilogram, and second. Thus the relationship in the definition of the ampere with the metre and newton is disregarded, and the ampere is not treated as dimensionally equivalent to any combination of other base units. As a result, electromagnetic laws in SI require an additional constant of proportionality (see [[Vacuum permittivity]]) to relate electromagnetic units to kinematic units. (This constant of proportionality is derivable directly from the above definition of the ampere.) All other electric and magnetic units are derived from these four base units using the most basic common definitions: for example, [[charge (physics)|electric charge]] ''q'' is defined as current ''I'' multiplied by time ''t'',
::&lt;math&gt;q=I\cdot t&lt;/math&gt;,
:therefore the unit of electric charge, the [[coulomb]] (C), is defined as 1&amp;nbsp;C = 1&amp;nbsp;A⋅s.
* The CGS system avoids introducing new base quantities and units, and instead ''derives'' all electric and magnetic units directly from the centimetre, gram, and second by specifying the form of the expression of physical laws that relate electromagnetic phenomena to mechanics.

===Alternate derivations of CGS units in electromagnetism===
Electromagnetic relationships to length, time and mass may be derived by several equally appealing methods. Two of them rely on the forces observed on charges. Two fundamental laws relate (seemingly independently of each other) the electric charge or its [[derivative|rate of change]] (electric current) to a mechanical quantity such as force. They can be written&lt;ref name=Jack&gt;{{cite book

| publisher=Wiley 
| year=1999 
| isbn=0-471-30932-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in system-independent form as follows:

*The first is [[Coulomb's law]], &lt;math&gt;F = k_{\rm C} \frac{q \cdot q^\prime}{d^2}&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the electrostatic force ''F'' between electric charges &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, separated by distance ''d''. Here &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant which depends on how exactly the unit of charge is derived from the base units.
*The second is [[Ampère's force law]], &lt;math&gt;\frac{dF}{dL} = 2 k_{\rm A}\frac{I \, I^\prime}{d}&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the magnetic force ''F'' per unit length ''L'' between currents ''I'' and ''I&amp;prime;'' flowing in two straight parallel wires of infinite length, separated by a distance ''d'' that is much greater than the wire diameters. Since &lt;math&gt;I=q/t\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; I^\prime=q^\prime/t&lt;/math&gt;, the constant &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A}&lt;/math&gt; also depends on how the unit of charge is derived from the base units.

[[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism]] relates these two laws to each other. It states that the ratio of proportionality constants &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A}&lt;/math&gt; must obey &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C} / k_{\rm A} = c^2&lt;/math&gt;, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in [[vacuum]]. Therefore, if one derives the unit of charge from the Coulomb's law by setting &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C}=1&lt;/math&gt; then Ampère's force law will contain a prefactor &lt;math&gt;2/c^2&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, deriving the unit of current, and therefore the unit of charge, from the Ampère's force law by setting &lt;math&gt; k_{\rm A} = 1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A} = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;, will lead to a constant prefactor in the Coulomb's law.

Indeed, both of these mutually exclusive approaches have been practiced by the users of CGS system, leading to the two independent and mutually exclusive branches of CGS, described in the subsections below. However, the freedom of choice in deriving electromagnetic units from the units of length, mass, and time is not limited to the definition of charge. While the electric field can be related to the work performed by it on a moving electric charge, the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the moving charge, and thus the work performed by the magnetic field on any charge is always zero. This leads to a choice between two laws of magnetism, each relating magnetic field to mechanical quantities and electric charge:
* The first law describes the [[Lorentz force]] produced by a magnetic field '''B''' on a charge '''q''' moving with velocity '''v''':
:: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} =  \alpha_{\rm L} q\;\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}\;. &lt;/math&gt;
* The second describes the creation of a static magnetic field '''B''' by an electric current ''I'' of finite length d'''l''' at a point displaced by a vector '''r''', known as [[Biot–Savart law]]:
:: &lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{B} =  \alpha_{\rm B}\frac{I d\mathbf{l} \times \mathbf{\hat r}}{r^2}\;,&lt;/math&gt; where ''r'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat r}&lt;/math&gt; are the length and the unit vector in the direction of vector '''r''' respectively.
These two laws can be used to derive [[Ampère's force law]] above, resulting in the relationship: &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A}  = \alpha_{\rm L} \cdot \alpha_{\rm B}\;&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, if the unit of charge is based on the [[Ampère's force law]] such that &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A}  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, it is natural to derive the unit of magnetic field by setting &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\rm L} = \alpha_{\rm B}=1\;&lt;/math&gt;. However, if it is not the case, a choice has to be made as to which of the two laws above is a more convenient basis for deriving the unit of magnetic field.

Furthermore, if we wish to describe the [[electric displacement field]] '''D''' and the [[magnetic field]] '''H''' in a medium other than vacuum, we need to also define the constants ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, which are the [[vacuum permittivity]] and [[magnetic constant|permeability]], respectively. &lt;!-- These two values are related by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon_0}=\alpha_{\rm B} / c&lt;/math&gt;. // removed this statement - seems impossible to prove! --&gt; Then we have&lt;ref name=Jack/&gt; (generally) &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} = \epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \lambda \mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{B} / \mu_0 - \lambda^\prime \mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt;, where '''P''' and '''M''' are [[polarization density]] and [[magnetization]] vectors. The units of '''P''' and '''M''' are usually so chosen that the factors λ and λ′ are equal to the "rationalization constants" &lt;math&gt;4 \pi k_{\rm C} \epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4 \pi \alpha_{\rm B} / (\mu_0 \alpha_{\rm L})&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. If the rationalization constants are equal, then &lt;math&gt;c^2 = 1 / (\epsilon_0 \mu_0 \alpha_{\rm L}^2)&lt;/math&gt;. If they are equal to one, then the system is said to be "rationalized":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the laws for systems of [[spherical geometry]] contain factors of 4π (for example, [[point charge]]s), those of cylindrical geometry – factors of 2π (for example, [[wire]]s), and those of planar geometry contain no factors of π (for example, parallel-plate [[capacitor]]s). However, the original CGS system used λ = λ′ = 4π, or, equivalently, &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C} \epsilon_0 = \alpha_{\rm B} / (\mu_0 \alpha_{\rm L}) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, Gaussian, ESU, and EMU subsystems of CGS (described below) are not rationalized.

===Various extensions of the CGS system to electromagnetism===
The table below shows the values of the above constants used in some common CGS subsystems:

The constant ''b'' in SI system is a unit-based scaling factor defined as: &lt;math&gt;b=10^7\,\mathrm{A}^2/\mathrm{N} = 10^7\,\mathrm{m/H}=4\pi/\mu_0=4\pi\epsilon_0 c^2=c^2 / k_{\rm C}\;&lt;/math&gt;.

Also, note the following correspondence of the above constants to those in Jackson&lt;ref name=Jack/&gt; and Leung:&lt;ref name=leu/&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C}=k_1=k_{\rm E}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A}=k_2=k_{\rm E}/c^2&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\rm L}=k_3=k_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt;

In system-independent form, [[Maxwell's equations]] can be written as:&lt;ref name=Jack/&gt;&lt;ref name=leu&gt;{{cite journal

\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that of all these variants, only in Gaussian and Heaviside–Lorentz systems &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\rm L}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;c^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; rather than 1. As a result, vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec B&lt;/math&gt; of an [[electromagnetic wave]] propagating in vacuum have the same units and are equal in [[Magnitude (mathematics)#Euclidean vectors|magnitude]] in these two variants of CGS.

==={{anchor|ESU}}Electrostatic units (ESU)===
{{main|Electrostatic units}}
In one variant of the CGS system, '''Electrostatic units''' ('''ESU'''), charge is defined via the force it exerts on other charges, and current is then defined as charge per time. It is done by setting the [[Coulomb force constant]] &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, so that [[Coulomb's law]] does not contain an explicit [[Proportionality (mathematics)|prefactor]].

The ESU unit of charge, '''franklin''' ('''Fr'''), also known as '''[[statcoulomb]]''' or '''esu charge''', is therefore defined as follows:&lt;ref name=cardsgc&gt;{{cite book
| author = Cardarelli, F.
| year = 2004
| title = Encyclopaedia of Scientific Units, Weights and Measures: Their SI Equivalences and Origins
| publisher = Springer

| isbn= 1-85233-682-X
| url= https://books.google.com/?id=6KCx8Ww75VkC
}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|text=two equal point charges spaced 1 [[centimetre]] apart are said to be of 1 franklin each if the electrostatic force between them is 1 [[dyne]].}} Therefore, in '''electrostatic CGS units''', a franklin is equal to a centimetre times square root of dyne:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{1\,Fr = 1\,statcoulomb = 1\,esu\; charge = 1\,cm\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{3/2} \cdot s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;.
The unit of current is defined as:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{1\,Fr/s = 1\,statampere = 1\,esu\; current = 1\,(cm/s)\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{3/2} \cdot s^{-2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Dimensionally in the ESU CGS system, charge ''q'' is therefore equivalent to m&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;t&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence, neither charge nor current is an independent physical quantity in ESU CGS. This reduction of units is the consequence of the [[Buckingham π theorem]].

====ESU notation====
All electromagnetic units in ESU CGS system that do not have proper names are denoted by a corresponding SI name with an attached prefix "stat" or with a separate abbreviation "esu".&lt;ref name=cardsgc/&gt;

==={{anchor|EMU}}Electromagnetic units (EMU)===
In another variant of the CGS system, '''electromagnetic units''' ('''EMU'''), current is defined via the force existing between two thin, parallel, infinitely long wires carrying it, and charge is then defined as current multiplied by time. (This approach was eventually used to define the SI unit of [[ampere]] as well). In the EMU CGS subsystem, this is done by setting the Ampere force constant &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, so that [[Ampère's force law]] simply contains 2 as an explicit [[Proportionality (mathematics)|prefactor]] (this prefactor 2 is itself a result of integrating a more general formulation of Ampère's law over the length of the infinite wire).

The EMU unit of current, '''biot''' ('''Bi'''), also known as '''[[abampere]]''' or '''emu current''', is therefore defined as follows:&lt;ref name=cardsgc/&gt;
{{quote|text=The '''biot''' is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed one [[centimetre]] apart in [[vacuum]], would produce between these conductors a force equal to two [[dyne]]s per centimetre of length.}} Therefore, in '''electromagnetic CGS units''', a biot is equal to a square root of dyne:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{1\,Bi = 1\,abampere = 1\,emu\; current= 1\,\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{1/2} \cdot s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;.
The unit of charge in CGS EMU is:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{1\,Bi\cdot s = 1\,abcoulomb = 1\,emu\, charge= 1\,s\cdot\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Dimensionally in the EMU CGS system, charge ''q'' is therefore equivalent to m&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence, neither charge nor current is an independent physical quantity in EMU CGS.

====EMU notation====
All electromagnetic units in EMU CGS system that do not have proper names are denoted by a corresponding SI name with an attached prefix "ab" or with a separate abbreviation "emu".&lt;ref name=cardsgc/&gt;

===Relations between ESU and EMU units===
The ESU and EMU subsystems of CGS are connected by the fundamental relationship &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C} / k_{\rm A} = c^2&lt;/math&gt; (see above), where ''c'' = 29,979,245,800 ≈ 3⋅10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum in centimetres per second. Therefore, the ratio of the corresponding "primary" electrical and magnetic units (e.g. current, charge, voltage, etc. – quantities proportional to those that enter directly into [[Coulomb's law]] or [[Ampère's force law]]) is equal either to ''c''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or ''c'':&lt;ref name=cardsgc/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{1\,statcoulomb}{1\,abcoulomb}}=
\mathrm{\frac{1\,statampere}{1\,abampere}}=c^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{1\,statvolt}{1\,abvolt}}=
\mathrm{\frac{1\,stattesla}{1\,gauss}}=c&lt;/math&gt;.
Units derived from these may have ratios equal to higher powers of ''c'', for example:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{1\,statohm}{1\,abohm}}=
\mathrm{\frac{1\,statvolt}{1\,abvolt}}\times\mathrm{\frac{1\,abampere}{1\,statampere}}=c^2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Practical cgs units===
The practical cgs system is a hybrid system that uses the [[volt]] and the [[ampere]] as the unit of voltage and current respectively.  Doing this avoids the inconveniently large and small quantities that arise for electromagnetic units in the esu and emu systems.  This system was at one time widely used by electrical engineers because the volt and amp had been adopted as international standard units by the International Electrical Congress of 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tunbridge, ''Lord Kelvin: His Influence on Electrical Measurements and Units'', pp. 34-40, IET, 1992 {{ISBN|0863412378}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as the volt and amp, the [[farad]] (capacitance), [[ohm]] (resistance), [[coulomb]] (electric charge), and [[henry (unit)|henry]] are consequently also used in the practical system and are the same as the SI units.  However, [[intensive properties]] (that is, anything that is per unit length, area, or volume) will not be the same as SI since the cgs unit of distance is the centimetre.  For instance [[electric field strength]] is in units of volts per centimetre, [[magnetic field strength]] is in [[oersted]]s and [[resistivity]] is in ohm-cm.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz E. Knoepfel, ''Magnetic Fields: A Comprehensive Theoretical Treatise for Practical Use'', p. 543, Wiley, 2000 {{ISBN|3527617426}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[physicists]] and [[electrical engineers]] in North America still use these hybrid units.&lt;ref&gt;Knoepfel, p. xx{{failed verification|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other variants===
There were at various points in time about half a dozen systems of electromagnetic units in use, most based on the CGS system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In this table, ''c'' = 29,979,245,800 is the numeric value of the [[speed of light]] in vacuum when expressed in units of centimetres per second. The symbol "↔" is used instead of "=" as a reminder that the SI and CGS units are ''corresponding'' but not ''equal'' because they have incompatible dimensions. For example, according to the next-to-last row of the table, if a capacitor has a capacitance of 1&amp;nbsp;F in SI, then it has a capacitance of (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cm in ESU; ''but'' it is usually incorrect to replace "1&amp;nbsp;F" with "(10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cm" within an equation or formula. (This warning is a special aspect of electromagnetism units in CGS. By contrast, for example, it is ''always'' correct to replace "1&amp;nbsp;m" with "100&amp;nbsp;cm" within an equation or formula.)

One can think of the SI value of the [[Coulomb constant]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; as:
:&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}=\frac{\mu_0 (c/100)^2}{4\pi}=10^{-7}{\rm N}/{\rm A}^2\cdot 10^{-4}\cdot c^2 = 10^{-11}{\rm N}\cdot c^2/{\rm A}^2 .&lt;/math&gt;
This explains why SI to ESU conversions involving factors of ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lead to significant simplifications of the ESU units, such as 1&amp;nbsp;statF = 1&amp;nbsp;cm and 1&amp;nbsp;statΩ = 1&amp;nbsp;s/cm: this is the consequence of the fact that in ESU system ''k''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. For example, a centimetre of capacitance is the capacitance of a sphere of radius 1&amp;nbsp;cm in vacuum. The capacitance ''C'' between two concentric spheres of radii ''R'' and ''r'' in ESU CGS system is:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{R}}&lt;/math&gt;.
By taking the limit as ''R'' goes to infinity we see ''C'' equals ''r''.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
While the absence of explicit prefactors in some CGS subsystems simplifies some theoretical calculations, it has the disadvantage that sometimes the units in CGS are hard to define through experiment. Also, lack of unique unit names leads to a great confusion: thus “15 emu” may mean either 15 [[abvolt]]s, or 15 emu units of [[electric dipole moment]], or 15 emu units of [[magnetic susceptibility]], sometimes (but not always) per [[gram]], or per [[mole (unit)|mole]]. On the other hand, SI starts with a unit of current, the [[ampere]], that is easier to determine through experiment, but which requires extra multiplicative factors in the electromagnetic equations. With its system of uniquely named units, the SI also removes any confusion in usage: 1.0 ampere is a fixed value of a specified quantity, and so are 1.0 [[henry (unit)|henry]], 1.0 [[ohm]], and 1.0 volt.

A key virtue of the [[Gaussian units|Gaussian CGS system]] is that electric and magnetic fields have the same units, 4''πε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is replaced by 1, and the only dimensional constant appearing in the [[Maxwell equations]] is ''c'', the speed of light. The [[Lorentz–Heaviside units|Heaviside–Lorentz system]] has these desirable properties as well (with ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; equaling 1), but it is a “rationalized” system (as is SI) in which the charges and fields are defined in such a way that there are many fewer factors of 4''π'' appearing in the formulas, and it is in Heaviside–Lorentz units that the Maxwell equations take their simplest form.

In SI, and other rationalized systems (for example, [[Lorentz–Heaviside units|Heaviside–Lorentz]]), the unit of current was chosen such that electromagnetic equations concerning charged spheres contain 4π, those concerning coils of current and straight wires contain 2π and those dealing with charged surfaces lack π entirely, which was the most convenient choice for applications in [[electrical engineering]]. However, modern [[calculator|hand calculator]]s and [[personal computer]]s have eliminated this "advantage". In some fields where formulas concerning spheres are common (for example, in  astrophysics), it has been argued{{by whom|date=July 2014}} that the nonrationalized CGS system can be somewhat more convenient notationally.

Specialized unit systems are used to simplify formulas even further than ''either'' SI ''or'' CGS, by eliminating constants through some system of [[natural units]]. For example, in [[particle physics]] a system is in use where every quantity is expressed by only one unit of energy, the [[electronvolt]], with lengths, times, and so on all converted into electronvolts by inserting factors of [[speed of light|speed of light ''c'']] and the [[Planck constant|Planck constant ''ħ'']]. This unit system is very convenient for calculations in [[particle physics]], but it would be considered impractical in other contexts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11903">'''Clinical and Translational Science Award''' (CTSA) is a type of [[Federal grants in the United States|U.S. federal grant]] administered by the [[National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences]], part of the [[National Institutes of Health]]. The CTSA program began in October 2006 under the auspices of the [[National Center for Research Resources]] with a [[consortium]] of 12 [[Medical school in the United States#Academic health centers|academic health centers]]. The program was fully implemented in 2012, comprising 60 grantee institutions and their partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/clinicalresearch/overview-translational.asp |title=Re-engineering the Clinical Research Enterprise: Translational Research |author=National Institutes of Health |date=Sep 17, 2009 |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program overview ==
The CTSA program helps institutions create an integrated academic home for clinical and [[translational science]] with the resources to support researchers and research teams working to apply new knowledge and techniques to patient care. The program is structured to encourage collaborations among researchers from different scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-10-001.html |title=Institutional Clinical and Translational Science Award (U54)|author=National Institutes of Health |date=Jan 26, 2010|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CTSA program has raised awareness of clinical and translational science as a [[academic discipline|discipline]] among academic and industry researchers, philanthropists, government officials and the broader public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ctssociety.org/Home/PresidentsLetterMay2009/tabid/71/ItemId/0/Default.aspx |title=Presidents Letter|author1=Society for Clinical |author2=Translational Science |date=May 22, 2009|accessdate=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategic goals ==
CTSA consortium leaders have set five broad goals to guide their activities. These include building national clinical and translational research capability, providing training and improving career development of clinical and translational scientists, enhancing consortium-wide collaborations, improving the health of U.S. communities and the nation, and advancing [[Translational medicine#Phase one research|T1 translational research]] to move basic laboratory discoveries and knowledge into clinical testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/publications/pdf/ctsa_factsheet.pdf |title=NCRR Fact Sheet: Clinical and Translational Science Awards |author=National Center for Research Resources |date=Fall 2009 |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selected research areas ==
Institutions funded by the CTSA program are working with other research facilities to improve drug discovery and development. For example, several consortium institutions are collaborating with the [http://www.nrrrc.missouri.edu Rat Resource and Research Center] at the [[University of Missouri]] to increase the speed of drug screening so that drug research is translated into clinical uses more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/publications/pdf/ctsa_factsheet.pdf |title=NCRR Fact Sheet: Clinical and Translational Science Awards |author=National Center for Research Resources |date=Fall 2009 |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consortium institutions also are creating new fields of study or new uses for technologies. For example, researchers at the [[University of Rochester]] are pioneering the field of [[lipidomics]], exploring how [[lipids]] affect human disease. Their work has led to lipid research collaborations among experts in community and [[preventive medicine]], [[proteomics]], [[nutrition]], and [[pharmaceutical research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/publications/pdf/ctsa_factsheet.pdf |title=NCRR Fact Sheet: Clinical and Translational Science Awards |author=National Center for Research Resources |date=Fall 2009 |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some CTSA institutions are collaborating with [[community-based organization]]s to ensure research is translated successfully into clinical practice. Researchers at [[Duke University]] are working to prevent [[stroke]]s by partnering with a local health care program to build stroke awareness among Latino immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/publications/pdf/ctsa_factsheet.pdf |title=NCRR Fact Sheet: Clinical and Translational Science Awards |author=National Center for Research Resources |date=Fall 2009 |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others are pursuing [[Public-private partnership|public and private partnerships]] to speed innovation. For example, the [[Oregon Health and Science University]] and [[Intel]] are developing new wireless devices with sensors to detect [[symptoms]] in patients who have [[diabetes]] or those at high risk of [[stroke]] so they can be treated earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/publications/pdf/ctsa_factsheet.pdf |title=NCRR Fact Sheet: Clinical and Translational Science Awards |author=National Center for Research Resources |date=Fall 2009 |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Participating institutions ==
With the most recent awards, announced in July 2011, the consortium comprises 60 institutions in 30 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2011/07_22_2011/story8.htm |title=NIH Announces Five New Clinical and Translational Science Awards | author=National Institutes of Health |date=July 22, 2011 |accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctsaweb.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.showPartInstList |title=CTSA Institutions |author=Clinical and Translational Science Awards Consortium |date=September 7, 2011 |accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG)==

On the 20 December 2011, the OIG published a report critical of the NIH's administration of the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-07-09-00300.pdf | title = NIH Administration of the Clinical and Translational Science Awards Program (Report OEI-07-09-00300) | accessdate = 2011-12-22 | date = December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report read in part:

{{Quote box |quote =For all 38 Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) cooperative agreements awarded from 2006 through 2008, CTSA program staff did not document awardees' progress in compliance with NIH policy.

CTSA program staff must ensure that awardees submit annual progress reports and financial status reports, determine whether awardee progress remains satisfactory before awardees receive continued funding, and maintain official files in accordance with Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) policy. Additionally, under cooperative agreements, CTSA program staff provide assistance to awardees above and beyond the levels usually required for program stewardship of grants. This level of stewardship is known as substantial involvement. CTSA program staff assign NIH Project Scientists to awardees to provide this substantial involvement through technical assistance, advice, and coordination. Names of substantially involved staff and an annual summary of staff involvement should be documented in the official files.

CTSA program staff documented a comparison of accomplishments to research objectives for only 1 of 38 awardees throughout our review period. Although reviews for six awardees' files mentioned an inability to fulfill goals, only one file included a note from CTSA program staff regarding resolution. Also, most progress reports and half of financial status reports were late, yet the files contained no evidence that CTSA program staff took action to address timeliness of reports. CTSA program staff did not maintain files in accordance with HHS policy. Finally, no files contained evidence that CTSA program staff provided substantial involvement to awardees in accordance with Federal requirements and NIH policy.

We recommend that NIH ensure that CTSA program staff (1) document their monitoring of awardee progress; (2) ensure timely submission of required reports; (3) maintain official files in accordance with Federal policy; and (4) as required for cooperative agreements, provide substantial involvement to CTSA awardees. NIH concurred with our recommendations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14275">'''Community-driven development''' (CDD) is a [[development initiative]]{{what|date=September 2016}} that provides control of the [[economic development|development process]], resources and [[decision making]] authority directly to groups in the community. The underlying assumption of CDD projects are that communities are the best judges of how their lives and livelihoods can be improved and, if provided with adequate resources and information, they can organize themselves to provide for their immediate needs. CDD projects work by providing poor communities with direct funding for development with the communities then deciding how to spend the money. Lastly, the community plans and builds the project and takes responsibility for monitoring its progress.

== Characteristics of CDD ==
CDD programmes are motivated by their trust in people (Naidoo and Finn, 2001) and hence it advocates people changing their own [[Social environment|environment]] as a powerful force for development.

By treating poor people as assets and partners in the development process, studies have shown that CDD is responsive to local demands, inclusive, and more cost-effective compared to centrally-led [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]-based programmes. CDD can also be supported by strengthening and financing [[community group]]s, facilitating community access to information, and promoting an enabling environment through policy and [[institutional reform]] (Dongier, 2002).

Following from this description, field practitioners at the [[World Bank]] have denoted five key characteristics of CDD projects.
# A CDD operation primarily targets a [[community-based organization]] or a representative local council of a community. This community focus means that the essential defining characteristic of a CDD project is that the beneficiaries or grantees of implementations are agents of the community. Since the focus on small communities is so large the CDD normally targets small scale [[subproject]]s in the community.
# In CDD operations, community- or locally based representation is responsible for designing and planning the subprojects in a participatory manner. Since the concentration on participatory planning is considerable in CDD operations, often the possible types of subproject [[investment]] options are very large with only a small list of subprojects that cannot be carried out.
# The defining characteristic of CDD projects is that a transfer of resources to the community occurs and control of the resources is delegated to the community. The amount of transfer and control of resources will depend on the CDD implementations.
# The community is directly involved in the implementation of the subproject. Often the participation of the community comes directly in the form of labour or funds. However, the community may also contribute to the subproject indirectly in the form of management and supervision of contractors or the operation and maintenance of the [[infrastructure]] when complete.
# An element of community-based [[monitoring and evaluation]] has become a characteristic of CDD subprojects. Most often it is [[social accountability]] tools such as [[participatory monitoring]], community scorecards and [[grievance redress]] systems which allow for the community to ensure accountability of the CDD implementation.

== CDD vs. CBD ==
Community-driven development is derived from [[community-based development]] (CBD) which can include a much broader range of projects. For example, CBD projects can include everything from simple [[information sharing]] to social, economic and political empowerment of community groups. However, CDD projects fit on the [[empowerment]] end of CBD by actively engaging beneficiaries in the design, management and implementation of projects. The stress on actual control of decision-making and project resources at nearly all stages of a subproject cycle distinguishes CDD from the previous generation of CBD projects. In this continuum of [[community participation]] covered by CBD, new-generation CDD projects are located at the extreme right (Tanaka, 2006).

Since community-driven development has only recently diverged from the broad community-based development there are a few contrasts visible in the five characteristics of CDD programmes. In essence, all five properties of CDD projects exist together only in the newer generation of CDD implementations. Nevertheless, the first attribute of community focus would apply to all CDD projects and CBD projects. In contrast, the second characteristic of [[participatory planning]] and design and the fourth property of community involvement are often visible among all CDD projects but very rarely in CBD projects. Moreover, community-based monitoring and evaluation which is the fifth aspect of CDD projects is only found in some of the newer projects. The fifth characteristic is what positions many of the newer CDD projects in the extreme right of the CDD cluster as diagrammatically demonstrated in Figure 1. As mentioned above, the third characteristic of community control of resources seems to be the key factor to conceptually distinguish between CDD and CBD projects. However, many of the early NGOs implementing CDD projects did not always interpret this factor rigorously (Tanaka, 2006). Thus, the distinction between CDD projects and CBD projects with CDD components was not always clear; however, this would be expected since there was a gradual evolution of CDD out of CBD.

To alleviate the earlier problems of over-reliance on [[central government]]s as the main [[service provider]], CDD programs were launched by the World Bank to improve the accountability and services in key areas. However, NGOs quickly learned that well designed and implemented CDD programmes had ripple effects of promoting equity and inclusiveness, [[efficiency]] and good governance. By effectively targeting and including the vulnerable and excluded groups, as well as allowing communities to manage and control resources directly it was evident that CDD programs could allow poverty reduction projects to scale up quickly. Efficiency is gained through demand responsive allocation of resources, reduced corruption and misuse of resources, lower costs and better [[cost recovery]], better quality and maintenance, greater utilization of resources, and the community‘s willingness to pay for goods and services. Good governance is promoted by greater transparency, accountability in allocation and use of resources because the community participates in project decision-making processes. Some of the principles of CDD—such as participation, empowerment, accountability, and [[nondiscrimination]]—are also worthy ends in themselves ([[Asian Development Bank]], 2008).

It was as early as 1881 when [[T.H. Green]] who wrote about the maximum power for all members of [[human society]] alike to make the best of themselves (Zakaria, 1999). However, it was not until the 1970s with [[John Rawls]]’ book ―[[A Theory of Justice]] and in the 1990s with [[Amartya Sen]]‘s book ―[[Development as Freedom]] where the notions of [[substantive freedom]] and the multidimensional nature of [[poverty]] were made explicit to the [[multilateral development bank]]s. This recognition of the multidimensional nature of poverty as well as the combined failures of both markets and governments and the socio-political complexity of ground level realities has made it clear that relying on traditional top-down, state-led, ―big development‖ strategies would not be effective to combat poverty. Moreover, this resurgence in participatory development and bottom-up approaches in the NGO and [[development sector]] has come in only the last two decades as explained above.

== Expansion of community-driven development ==
Since the mid-1990s, community-driven development has emerged as one of the fastest-growing investments by NGOs, [[aid organization]]s and multilateral developments banks. This continued investment in CDD has been driven mostly by a demand from donor agencies and developing countries for large-scale, bottom-up and demand-driven, [[poverty reduction]] subprojects that can increase the institutional capacity of small communities for self-development.&lt;ref&gt;Petr Matous: [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09614524.2013.772116 The making and unmaking of community-based water supplies in Manila], Development in Practice, Volume 23, Issue 2, 2013, p. 217-231.&lt;/ref&gt; The success and scale of some CDD projects in the World Bank are especially notable. The World Bank supported approximately 190 lending projects amounting to $9.3 billion in 2000–2005 (Tanaka, 2006). Initiated by the [[International Development Association]] (IDA) at the World Bank, CDD projects have been instrumental in harnessing the energy and capacity of communities for poverty reduction. Since the start of this decade, IDA lending for CDD has averaged annually just over 50 operations, for an average total of US$1.3 billion per year (International Development Association, 2009).

Even the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has funded 57 projects worth about $2.5 billion between 2001-2007 that included community-driven development approaches to enhance deliver of inputs and beneficiary participation. They constituted 14% of the total loans approved by the Asian Development Bank during this period. Over one-third of the projects were in the [[agriculture]] and [[natural resources]] sector, followed by a smaller proportion of [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]], [[waste management]], [[education]] and [[health]] projects. The projects were primarily in [[Southeast Asia]], [[South Asia]], and [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[West Asia]], where the [[developing country]] governments were investing in [[rural development]] programs (Asian Development Bank, 2008).

In the last few years the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] has been working with the [[French Development Agency|Agence française de développement]] (AFD), the [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB), the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] (FAO), the [[UN Capital Development Fund]] (UNCDF) and the [[World Bank]] to create a platform for learning and sharing knowledge on community-driven development (International Fund for Agricultural Development, 2010). Intensive forms of community participation have been attempted in projects of several donors for many years. [[Bilateral donor]]s, such as the [[Department for International Development]] (DFID) of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA), have used CDD-type approaches for a long time as part of their sustainable livelihoods and integrated basic needs development assistance in developing countries. The [[Swedish International Development Agency]] (SIDA) and [[Danish International Development Agency]] have used CDD principles in the mandate of a rights-based approach to the development projects they fund (FAO, 2010).

More than 80 countries have now implemented CDD projects. The breadth and activities funded by the CDD programs at the World Bank can be explained by providing a brief overview of a few of them.

The Second [[National Fadama Development Project II]] (NFDP-II) targets the development of small scale [[irrigation]], especially in the low-lying alluvial floodplains or "[[Fadama]]‖. NFDP-II increased the productivity, living standards and development capacity of the economically active rural communities while increasing the efficiency in delivering implementation services to an estimated four million rural beneficiary households and raising the real incomes of households by 45 percent (African Development Bank, 2003). The [[Social Fund for Development]] in [[Yemen]] provided support 7 million people of which 49 percent were female and generated 8,000 permanent jobs. It also increased the number of girls‘ schools from 502 to 554 and [[basic education]] enrollment rates from 63 percent to 68 percent. The program focuses on helping the poor to help themselves through providing income-generating activities and building [[community infrastructure]] rather than making cash transfers (El-Gammal, 2004). The [[Social Investment Fund Project V]] in [[Honduras]] benefited 2.5 million people with the implementation of 2,888 projects (1,446 rehabilitated schools, about 700 new schools, 163 new health centers, 347 small water/sanitation systems, and 461 latrines) resulting in all children in the targeted areas attending [[primary school]]. In addition the project communities were provided with better access to health care assistance and access to running water (Perez de Castillo, 1998). The [[Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Project]] (APRPRP) in [[India]] has help to organize 10.1 million rural poor women into community-based organizations that collectively save over US$770 million and leverage credit over $2.7 billion from commercial banks (World Bank, 2003). The [[Kecamatan Development Program]] (KDP) in [[Indonesia]] which is what the [[National Solidarity Program]] in [[Afghanistan]] is based on has benefitted 18 million people by providing better services which include more than 37,000 kilometers of local roads and 8,500 bridges, 9,200 clean [[water supply]] units, and 3,000 new or improved health posts. In addition, more than 1.3 million people obtained loans to start or complement local businesses through [[microfinancing]] (Guggenheim, 2004). Lastly, the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) in Afghanistan will be the focus of this research. In this implementation elected village-level community development councils, which include women, use grants and local labor to rebuild bridges and roads, fix schools and install [[water pump]]s to benefit 13 million people across Afghanistan thereby building state credibility and strengthening local [[democracy]].

The '''''Course of Theoretical Physics''''' is a ten-volume series of books covering [[theoretical physics]] that was initiated by [[Lev Landau]] and written in collaboration with his student [[Evgeny Lifshitz]] starting in the late 1930s.

It is said that Landau composed much of the series in his head while in an [[NKVD]] prison in 1938-1939.&lt;ref&gt;

J. Kearsley, and W. H. Reid. The last two volumes were written in the early 1980s. [[Vladimir Berestetskii]] and [[Lev Pitaevskii]] also contributed to the series. The series is often referred to as "'''Landau and Lifshitz'''", "'''Landafshitz'''" (Russian: "Ландафшиц"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://written.ru/articles/notes/simplicity |title=О простоте |date=2006-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zlo.rt.mipt.ru/?read=7096295 |title=Форум-ФРТК-МФТИ: чем ландафшиц не понравился? |date=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "'''Lanlifshitz'''" (Russian: "Ланлифшиц") in informal settings.

==Impact==
The presentation of material is advanced and typically considered suitable for [[Graduate school|graduate-level]] study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Administrivia/booklist.html |title=A Physics Book List |website=math.ucr.edu |access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Aboites |first=Vicente |date=2005-11-01 |title=Feynman: The Lectures and the Man |journal=[[Physics Today]] |volume=58 |issue=11 |pages=12–12 |doi=10.1063/1.4796780 |issn=0031-9228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this specialized character, it is estimated that a million volumes of the ''Course'' were sold by 2005.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

The original edition was two books, labelled part 1 and part 2. The first had general aspects of [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] and relativistic [[quantum field theory]], leading onto [[quantum electrodynamics]]. The second continued on with quantum electrodynamics and what was then known about the [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[weak interaction]]s. These books were published in the early 1970s, at a time when the strong and weak forces were still not well understood. In the second edition, the corresponding sections were scrapped and replaced with more topics in the well-established quantum electrodynamics, and the two parts were unified into one, thus providing a one-volume exposition on relativistic quantum field theory with the electromagnetic interaction as the prototype of a quantum field theory.

In Christian and Jewish [[creationism]], a religious view based on the creation account of the [[book of Genesis]], '''created kinds''' are purported to be the original forms of life as they were created by [[God]].  They are also referred to as '''kinds''', '''original kinds''', '''Genesis kinds''', and '''baramin''' (a [[neologism]] coined by combining the Hebrew words ''bara'' [created] and ''min'' [kind], though the combination does not work syntactically in actual [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]). The idea is promulgated by [[Young Earth Creationists|young Earth creationist]] organizations and preachers as a means to support their belief in the literal veracity of [[Creation according to Genesis|the Genesis creation myth]] as well as their contention that the ancestors of all land-based life on Earth were housed on [[Noah's ark]] before a [[deluge (mythology)|great flood]]. [[Old Earth creationism|Old earth creationists]] also employ the concept, rejecting the idea of [[common descent]]. In contrast to young Earth creationists, old earth creationists do not necessarily believe all land-based life was housed on the ark, and some accept some evolutionary change within the given kinds has occurred. 

In contrast to the [[Scientific theory#Science|scientific theory]] of [[common descent]], these creationists argue that not all life on Earth is related, but that life was created by God in a finite number of discrete forms.  This viewpoint claims that kinds cannot interbreed and have no [[evolution]]ary relationship to one another.&lt;ref name="Wood 2003"&gt;{{cite web

==Definitions==
The concept of the "kind" originates from a [[Biblical literalism|literal reading]] of Genesis 1:12-24:

{{quote|And God said, let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind … And God created great whales and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind … And God said, let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind, and it was so.}}

There is some uncertainty about what exactly the Bible means when it talks of "kinds." Creationist Brian Nelson claimed "While the Bible allows that new varieties may have arisen since the creative days, it denies that any new species have arisen." However, Russell Mixter, another creationist writer, said that "One should not insist that "kind" means species. The word "kind" as used in the Bible may apply to any animal which may be distinguished in any way from another, or it may be applied to a large group of species distinguishable from another group ... there is plenty of room for differences of opinion on what are the kinds of Genesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Payne|first=J. Barton|year=1958|title=The Concept of "Kinds" In Scripture|url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1958/JASA6-58Payne.html|journal=Journal of the American Science Affiliation|volume=10|issue=December 1958|pages=17–20|ref=harv|accessdate=2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Lewis Marsh]] coined the term ''baramin'' in his book ''Fundamental Biology'' (1941) and expanded on the concept in ''Evolution, Creation, and Science'' (c. 1944), in which he stated that the ability to hybridize and create viable offspring was a sufficient condition for being members of the same baramin.  However, he said that it was not a necessary condition, acknowledging that observed speciation events among ''[[Drosophila]]'' fruitflies had been shown to cut off hybridization.&lt;ref name="Wood 2003" /&gt;

Marsh also originated "discontinuity [[systematics]]", the idea that there are boundaries between different animals that cannot be crossed with the consequence that there would be discontinuities in the history of life and limits to common ancestry.&lt;ref name=Gishlick&gt;

==Baraminology==

In 1990, [[Kurt Wise]] introduced baraminology as an adaptation of Marsh's and Walter ReMine's ideas that was more in keeping with [[young Earth creationism]]. Wise advocated using the Bible as a source of systematic data.&lt;ref name="Wood 2003"/&gt; Baraminology and its associated concepts have been criticized by scientists and creationists for lacking formal structure. Consequently, in 2003 Wise and other creationists proposed a refined baramin concept in the hope of developing a broader creationary model of biology.&lt;ref name="Wood 2003"/&gt;
Alan Gishlick, reviewing the work of baraminologists in 2006, found it to be surprisingly rigorous and internally consistent, but concluded that the methods did not work.&lt;ref name=Gishlick /&gt;

Walter ReMine specified four groupings: holobaramins, monobaramins, apobaramins, and polybaramins. These are, respectively, all things of one kind; some things of the same kind; groups of kinds; and any mixed grouping of things.&lt;ref name=Frair&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups correspond to the concepts of [[holophyly]], [[monophyly]], [[paraphyly]], and [[polyphyly]] used in [[cladistics]].&lt;ref name=Gishlick /&gt;

===Methods===

Baraminology employs many of the same methods used in evolutionary systematics, including [[cladistics]] and Analysis of Pattern (ANOPA). However, instead of identifying continuity between groups of organisms based on shared similarities, baraminology uses these methods to search for morphological and genetic gaps between groups. Baraminologists have also developed their own systematics software, known as BDIST, to measure distance between groups.&lt;ref name=Gishlick/&gt;

The methods of baraminology are not universally accepted among young-Earth creationists. Other creationists have criticized these methods as having the same problems as traditional cladistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Baraminology has been heavily criticized for its lack of rigorous tests and post-study rejection of data to make it better fit the desired findings.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5217">'''Data exploration''' is an approach similar to initial data analysis, whereby a data analyst uses visual exploration to understand what is in a dataset and the characteristics of the data, rather than through traditional data management systems&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;[https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/sites/default/files/pdf/2933.pdf FOSTER Open Science], Overview of Data Exploration Techniques: Stratos Idreos, Olga Papaemmonouil, Surajit Chaudhuri.&lt;/ref&gt;. These characteristics can include size or amount of data, completeness of the data, correctness of the data, possible relationships amongst data elements or files/tables in the data.

Data exploration is typically conducted using a combination of automated and manual activities.&lt;ref name="Foster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanford2011"&gt;[http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2011-Wrangler-CHI.pdf Stanford.edu], 2011 Wrangler: Interactive Visual Specification of Data Transformation Scripts, Kandel, Paepcke, Hellerstein Heer.&lt;/ref&gt; Automated activities can include data profiling or data visualization or tabular reports to give the analyst an initial view into the data and an understanding of key characteristics.&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;[https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/sites/default/files/pdf/2933.pdf FOSTER Open Science], Overview of Data Exploration Techniques: Stratos Idreos, Olga Papaemmonouil, Surajit Chaudhuri.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is often followed by manual drill-down or filtering of the data to identify anomalies or patterns identified through the automated actions.  Data exploration can also require manual scripting and queries into the data (e.g. using languages such as SQL or R) or using Excel or similar tools to view the raw data.&lt;ref name="Stanford2012"&gt;[http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2012-EnterpriseAnalysisInterviews-VAST.pdf Stanford.edu], IEEE Visual Analytics Science &amp; Technology (VAST), Oct 2012 Enterprise Data Analysis and Visualization: An Interview Study., Sean Kandel, Andreas Paepcke, Joseph Hellerstein, Jeffrey Heer Proc.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these activities are aimed at creating a clear mental model and understanding of the data in the mind of the analyst, and defining basic metadata (statistics, structure, relationships) for the data set that can be used in further analysis.&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;[https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/sites/default/files/pdf/2933.pdf FOSTER Open Science], Overview of Data Exploration Techniques: Stratos Idreos, Olga Papaemmonouil, Surajit Chaudhuri.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once this initial understanding of the data is had, the data can be pruned or refined by removing unusable parts of the data, correcting poorly formatted elements and defining relevant relationships across datasets&lt;ref name="Stanford2011" /&gt;. This process is also known as determining [[data quality]]&lt;ref name="Stanford2012" /&gt;.

Data exploration can also refer to the ad hoc querying and visualization of data to identify potential relationships or insights that may be hidden in the data&lt;ref name="Foster" /&gt;.

Traditionally, this had been a key area of focus for statisticians, with [[John Tukey]] being a key evangelist in the field. &lt;ref name="Tukey, John W."&gt; [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~brill/Papers/EDASage.pdf Exploratory Data Analysis], Pearson. {{ISBN|978-0201076165}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Today, data exploration is more widespread and is the focus of data analysts and [[data scientists]]; the latter being a relatively new role within enterprises and larger organizations.

== Interactive Data Exploration ==
This area of data exploration has become an area of interest in the field of machine learning. This is a relatively new field and is still evolving.&lt;ref name="Stanford2012" /&gt;  As its most basic level, a machine-learning algorithm can be fed a data set and can be used to identify whether a hypothesis is true based on the dataset. Common machine learning algorithms can focus on identifying specific patterns in the data.&lt;ref name="Stanford2011" /&gt; Many common patterns include regression and classification or clustering, but there are many possible patterns and algorithms that can be applied to data via machine learning.

By employing machine learning, it is possible to find patterns or relationships in the data that would be difficult or impossible to find via manual inspection, trial and error or traditional exploration techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/talks/glasgow2017/ Machine Learning for Data Exploration]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Liberalism sidebar |Ideas}}
'''Democratic capitalism''', also known as '''capitalist democracy''', is a political, economic and social ideology that involves the combination of a [[democracy|democratic]] [[political system]] with a [[capitalist]] [[economic system]]. It is based on a tripartite arrangement of a private sector-driven [[market economy]] based predominantly on a [[democracy|democratic]] [[policy]], economic incentives through [[free markets]], [[fiscal responsibility]] and a [[liberalism|liberal]] [[moral]]-[[cultural]] system which encourages [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Novak |first=Michael|title=[[The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism]] |authorlink=Michael Novak|url=|date=|accessdate=|edition=|publisher=|isbn=|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Benne |first=Robert|title=The Ethic of Democratic Capitalism|page=97|isbn=0-8006-1445-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology supports a capitalist economy subject to control by a democratic political system that is supported by the majority. It stands in contrast to [[corporatism]] by limiting the influence of special interest groups, including corporate lobbyists, on politics.

It is argued that the coexistence of modern capitalism and democracy was the result of the creation of the modern [[welfare state]] in the post-war period, which enabled a relatively stable political atmosphere and widespread support for capitalism. This period of history is often referred to as the "[[Golden Age of Capitalism]]".&lt;ref name="Capitalism and Inequality, 2013"&gt;''Capitalism and Inequality'', by Muller, Jerry Z. 2013. Foreign Affairs, March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The ideology of "democratic capitalism" has been in existence since medieval times. It is based firmly on the principles of [[liberalism]] and [[Whig historiography]], which include liberty and equality. Some of its most prominent promoters were the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] and subsequent [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Prindle|first=David|title=The Paradox of Democratic Capitalism: Politics and Economics in American Thought|authorlink=David Prindle|isbn=0-8018-8411-X |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Development theory''' is a collection of [[theory|theories]] about how desirable change in society is best achieved. Such theories draw on a variety of social science disciplines and approaches. In this article, multiple theories are discussed, as are recent developments with regard to these theories. Depending on which theory that is being looked at, there are different explanations to the process of development and their inequalities.

== Modernization theory ==

{{Main|Modernization theory}}

Modernization theory is used to analyze the processes in which modernization in societies take place. The theory looks at which aspects of countries are beneficial and which constitute obstacles for [[economic development]]. The idea is that [[development assistance]] targeted at those particular aspects can lead to modernization of 'traditional' or 'backward' societies. Scientists from various research disciplines have contributed to modernization theory.

=== Sociological and anthropological modernization theory ===
The earliest principles of modernization theory can be derived from the idea of progress, which stated that people can develop and change their society themselves. [[Marquis de Condorcet]] was involved in the origins of this theory. This theory also states that technological advancements and economic changes can lead to changes in moral and cultural values. The French [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] stressed the interdependence of institutions in a society and the way in which they interact with cultural and social unity. His work ‘[[The Division of Labor in Society]]’ was very influential. It described how social order is maintained in society and ways in which primitive societies can make the transition to more advanced societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/dl.html |title=The Division of Labor in Society (1893) |publisher=Durkheim.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scientists who have contributed to the development of modernization theory are: [[David Apter]], who did research on the political system and history of democracy; [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], who argued that economic development leads to social changes which tend to lead to democracy; [[David McClelland]], who approached modernization from the psychological side with his motivations theory; and [[Talcott Parsons]] who used his pattern variables to compare backwardness to modernity.

=== Linear stages of growth model ===
The linear stages of growth model is an economic model which is heavily inspired by the [[Marshall Plan]] which was used to revitalize Europe’s economy after [[World War II]]. It assumes that [[economic growth]] can only be achieved by [[industrialization]]. Growth can be restricted by local institutions and social [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], especially if these aspects influence the [[savings rate]] and investments. The constraints impeding economic growth are thus considered by this model to be internal to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khun |first=Alex |url=http://ourdevelopment.blogspot.nl/2008/08/critical-review-of-modernisation-theory.html |title=Inform Educate Action: Critical Review of Modernisation Theory |publisher=Ourdevelopment.blogspot.nl |date=2008-08-06 |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the linear stages of growth model, a correctly designed massive injection of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] coupled with intervention by the [[public sector]] would ultimately lead to industrialization and [[economic development]] of a [[developing nation]].&lt;ref name="wiley1959"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cairncross | first1 = A. K. | title = The Stages of Economic Growth | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0289.1959.tb01829.x | journal = The Economic History Review | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 450–458 | year = 1961 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rostow's stages of growth]] model is the most well-known example of the linear stages of growth model.&lt;ref name="wiley1959" /&gt; [[Walt W. Rostow]] identified five stages through which developing countries had to pass to reach an advanced economy status: (1) Traditional society, (2) Preconditions for take-off, (3) Take-off, (4) Drive to maturity, (5) Age of high mass consumption. He argued that economic development could be led by certain strong sectors; this is in contrast to for instance [[Marxism]] which states that sectors should develop equally. According to Rostow’s model, a country needed to follow some rules of development to reach the take-off: (1) The investment rate of a country needs to be increased to at least 10% of its [[GDP]], (2) One or two [[manufacturing]] sectors with a high rate of growth need to be established, (3) An institutional, political and social framework has to exist or be created in order to promote the expansion of those sectors.&lt;ref name="mtholyoke1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ipe/rostow.htm |title=W.W. Rostow, The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1960), Chapter 2, "The Five Stages of Growth-A Summary," pp. 4-16 |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rostow model has serious flaws, of which the most serious are: (1) The model assumes that development can be achieved through a basic sequence of stages which are the same for all countries, a doubtful assumption; (2) The model measures development solely by means of the increase of GDP per capita; (3) The model focuses on characteristics of development, but does not identify the causal factors which lead development to occur. As such, it neglects the [[social structures]] that have to be present to foster development.&lt;ref name="mtholyoke1" /&gt;

Economic modernization theories such as Rostow's stages model have been heavily inspired by the [[Harrod-Domar model]] which explains in a mathematical way the growth rate of a country in terms of the savings rate and the productivity of capital.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econ.washington.edu/user/thornj/Harrod-Domar06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy state involvement has often been considered necessary for successful development in economic modernization theory; [[Paul Rosenstein-Rodan]], [[Ragnar Nurkse]] and [[Kurt Mandelbaum]] argued that a [[big push model]] in infrastructure investment and planning was necessary for the stimulation of industrialization, and that the private sector would not be able to provide the resources for this on its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professor-frithjof-kuhnen.de/publications/causes-of-underdevelopment/1-2-4.htm |title='Big |publisher=Professor-frithjof-kuhnen.de |date= |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another influential theory of modernization is the [[dual-sector model]] by [[Arthur Lewis (economist)|Arthur Lewis]]. In this model Lewis explained how the traditional stagnant [[rural sector]] is gradually replaced by a growing modern and dynamic  manufacturing and [[service economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/33695739/The-Lewis-Theory-of-Development |title=The Lewis Theory of Development |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the focus on the need for investments in capital, the Linear Stages of Growth Models are sometimes referred to as suffering from ‘capital fundamentalism’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&amp;theSitePK=544849&amp;piPK=64165421&amp;menuPK=64166093&amp;entityID=000009265_3961006071037 |title=Trade Research – Report Details |publisher=Econ.worldbank.org |date=1994-04-30 |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critics of modernization theory ===
[[Modernization theory]] observes traditions and pre-existing institutions of so-called "primitive" societies as obstacles to modern economic growth. Modernization which is forced from outside upon a society might induce violent and radical change, but according to modernization theorists it is generally worth this side effect. Critics point to traditional societies as being destroyed and slipping away to a modern form of poverty without ever gaining the promised advantages of modernization.

== Structuralism ==
{{Main|Structuralist economics}}

Structuralism is a development theory which focuses on structural aspects which impede the economic growth of developing countries. The [[unit of analysis]] is the transformation of a country’s economy from, mainly, a [[subsistence agriculture]] to a modern, urbanized manufacturing and [[service economy]]. Policy prescriptions resulting from structuralist thinking include major [[government intervention]] in the economy to fuel the [[industrial sector]], known as [[import substitution industrialization]] (ISI). This structural transformation of the developing country is pursued in order to create an economy which in the end enjoys self-sustaining growth. This can only be reached by ending the reliance of the underdeveloped country on exports of [[primary goods]] (agricultural and mining products), and pursuing inward-oriented development by shielding the domestic economy from that of the developed economies. Trade with advanced economies is minimized through the erection of all kinds of trade barriers and an overvaluation of the domestic exchange rate; in this way the production of domestic substitutes of formerly imported industrial products is encouraged. The logic of the strategy rests on the [[infant industry argument]], which states that young industries initially do not have the economies of scale and experience to be able to compete with foreign competitors and thus need to be protected until they are able to compete in the free market.&lt;ref&gt;http://eugeniomiravete.com/papers/Infant_Industry_Argument_Miravete01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prebisch–Singer hypothesis]] states that over time the [[terms of trade]] for [[commodities]] deteriorate compared to those for [[manufactured goods]], because the [[income elasticity of demand]] of manufactured goods is greater than that of primary products. If true, this would also support the ISI strategy.

Structuralists argue that the only way [[Third World]] countries can develop is through action by the state. Third world countries have to push industrialization and have to reduce their dependency on trade with the [[First World]], and trade among themselves.

The roots of structuralism lie in [[South America]], and particularly [[Chile]]. In 1950, [[Raul Prebisch]] went to Chile to become the first director of the [[Economic Commission for Latin America]]. In Chile, he cooperated with [[Celso Furtado]], [[Anibal Pinto]], [[Osvaldo Sunkel]], and [[Dudley Seers]], who all became influential structuralists.

== Dependency theory ==
{{Main|Dependency theory}}

Dependency theory is essentially a follow up to structuralist thinking, and shares many of its core ideas. Whereas structuralists did not consider that development would be possible at all unless a strategy of delinking and rigorous [[Import substitution industrialization|ISI]] was pursued, dependency thinking could allow development with external links with the developed parts of the globe. However, this kind of development is considered to be "dependent development", i.e., it does not have an internal domestic dynamic in the developing country and thus remains highly vulnerable to the economic vagaries of the world market. Dependency thinking starts from the notion that resources flow from the ‘[[Periphery countries|periphery]]’ of poor and [[underdeveloped]] states to a ‘[[Core countries|core]]’ of wealthy countries, which leads to accumulation of wealth in the rich states at the expense of the poor states. Contrary to [[modernization theory]], dependency theory states that not all societies progress through similar [[Dual-sector model|stages of development]]. Periphery states have unique features, structures and institutions of their own and are considered weaker with regards to the world [[market economy]], while the developed nations have never been in this colonized position in the past. Dependency theorists argue that underdeveloped countries remain economically vulnerable unless they reduce their connections to the world market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econ.utah.edu/~vernengo/papers/princeton.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324024418/http://www.econ.utah.edu/~vernengo/papers/princeton.pdf |date=March 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/depend.htm |title="Dependency Theory: An Introduction," Vincent Ferraro, Mount Holyoke College, July 1966 |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependency theory states that poor nations provide [[natural resources]] and cheap [[Wage labour|labor]] for [[developed nations]], without which the developed nations could not have the [[standard of living]] which they enjoy. When underdeveloped countries try to remove the Core's influence, the developed countries hinder their attempts to keep control. This means that [[poverty]] of developing nations is not the result of the disintegration of these countries in the [[World-systems theory|world system]], but because of the way in which they are integrated into this system.

In addition to its structuralist roots, dependency theory has much overlap with [[Neo-Marxism]] and [[World Systems Theory]], which is also reflected in the work of [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], a famous dependency theorist. Wallerstein rejects the notion of a Third World, claiming that there is only one world which is connected by economic relations ([[World Systems Theory]]). He argues that this system inherently leads to a division of the world in core, [[semi-periphery]] and [[Periphery countries|periphery]]. One of the results of expansion of the world-system is the [[commodification]] of things, like [[natural resources]], [[Wage labour|labor]] and [[human relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/Wallerstein.asp |title=Internet History Sourcebooks |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/users/f/felwell/www/Theorists/Wallerstein/Presentation/Wallerstein.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic needs ==
{{Main|Basic needs}}

The basic needs model was introduced by the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1976, mainly in reaction to prevalent modernization- and structuralism-inspired development approaches, which were not achieving satisfactory results in terms of poverty alleviation and combating inequality in developing countries. It tried to define an absolute minimum of resources necessary for long-term physical [[well-being]]. The [[poverty line]] which follows from this, is the amount of income needed to satisfy those basic needs. The approach has been applied in the sphere of development assistance, to determine what a society needs for subsistence, and for poor population groups to rise above the poverty line. Basic needs theory does not focus on investing in economically productive activities. Basic needs can be used as an indicator of the absolute minimum an individual needs to survive.

Proponents of basic needs have argued that elimination of [[absolute poverty]] is a good way to make people active in society so that they can provide labor more easily and act as consumers and savers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=762098|title=Basic Needs Strategies, Human Rights, and the Right to Development|first=Frances|last=Stewart|date=1 January 1989|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|volume=11|issue=3|pages=347–374|doi=10.2307/762098}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been also many critics of the basic needs approach. It would lack theoretical rigour, practical precision, be in conflict with [[Economic growth|growth promotion policies]], and run the risk of leaving developing countries in permanent.

== Neoclassical theory ==

Neoclassical development theory has it origins in its predecessor: [[classical economics]]. Classical economics was developed in the 18th and 19th centuries and dealt with the value of products and on which production factors it depends. Early contributors to this theory are [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]]. Classical economists argued – as do the neoclassical ones – in favor of the [[free market]], and against [[government intervention]] in those markets. The '[[invisible hand]]' of Adam Smith makes sure that [[free trade]] will ultimately benefit all of society. [[John Maynard Keynes]] was a very influential classical economist as well, having written his [[General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money]] in 1936.

Neoclassical development theory became influential towards the end of the 1970s, fired by the election of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the UK and [[Ronald Reagan]] in the USA. Also, the [[World Bank]] shifted from its Basic Needs approach to a neoclassical approach in 1980. From the beginning of the 1980s, neoclassical development theory really began to roll out.

=== Structural adjustment ===

One of the implications of the neoclassical development theory for developing countries were the [[Structural adjustment|Structural Adjustment Programmes]] (SAPs) which the World Bank and the [[International Monetary Fund]] wanted them to adapt. Important aspects of those SAPs include:
* [[Fiscal austerity]] (reduction in [[government spending]])
* [[Privatization]] (which should both raise money for governments and improve efficiency and financial performance of the firms involved)
* [[Trade liberalization]], [[currency devaluation]] and the abolition of [[marketing board]]s (to maximize the static [[comparative advantage]] the developing country has on the [[global market]])
* Retrenchment of the government and [[deregulation]] (in order to stimulate the free market)

These measures are more or less reflected by the themes which were identified by the Institute of International Economics which were believed to be necessary for the recovery of [[Latin America]] from the [[Latin American debt crisis|economic and financial crises of the 1980s]]. These themes are known as the [[Washington consensus]], a termed coined in 1989 by the economist [[John Williamson (economist)|John Williamson]].

== Recent trends ==

=== Post-development theory ===
{{Main|Postdevelopment theory}}

Postdevelopment theory is a [[school of thought]] which questions the idea of national [[economic development]] altogether. According to postdevelopment scholars, the goal of improving [[living standards]] leans on arbitrary claims as to the desirability and possibility of that goal. Postdevelopment theory arose in the 1980s and 1990s.

According to postdevelopment theorists, the idea of development is just a 'mental structure' ([[Wolfgang Sachs]]) which has resulted in a [[hierarchy]] of developed and underdeveloped nations, of which the [[underdeveloped nations]] desire to be like [[developed nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, Wolfgang (1992). The Development Dictionary: A Guide to Knowledge as Power. Zed Books. {{ISBN|1-85649-044-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Development thinking has been dominated by the West and is very [[ethnocentric]], according to Sachs. The Western lifestyle may neither be a realistic nor a desirable goal for the world's population, postdevelopment theorists argue. Development is being seen as a loss of a country's own culture, people's perception of themselves and modes of life. According to [[Majid Rahnema]], another leading postdevelopment scholar, things like notions of poverty are very culturally embedded and can differ a lot among cultures. The institutes which voice the concern over underdevelopment are very Western-oriented, and postdevelopment calls for a broader cultural involvement in development thinking.

Postdevelopment proposes a vision of [[society]] which removes itself from the ideas which currently dominate it. According to [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]], postdevelopment is interested instead in local culture and knowledge, a critical view against established sciences and the promotion of local [[grassroots]] movements. Also, postdevelopment argues for [[structural change]] in order to reach [[solidarity]], [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], and a larger involvement of [[traditional knowledge]].

=== Sustainable development ===
{{Main|Sustainable development}}

Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. ([[Brundtland Commission]]) There exist more definitions of sustainable development, but they all have to do with the [[Carrying capacity|carrying capacity of the earth]] and its [[Systems ecology|natural systems]] and the challenges faced by humanity. Sustainable development can be broken up into [[environmental sustainability]], economic sustainability and [[sociopolitical]] sustainability. The book '[[Limits to Growth]]', commissioned by the [[Club of Rome]], gave huge momentum to the thinking about sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Meadows et al. (1972), The Limits to Growth, Universe Books, {{ISBN|0-87663-165-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Global warming]] issues are also problems which are emphasized by the sustainable development movement. This led to the 1997 [[Kyoto Accord]], with the plan to cap [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas emissions]].

Opponents of the implications of sustainable development often point to the environmental [[Kuznets curve]]. The idea behind this curve is that, as an economy grows, it shifts towards more [[Capital intensive industry|capital and knowledge-intensive production]]. This means that as an economy grows, its pollution output increases, but only until it reaches a particular threshold where production becomes less resource-intensive and more sustainable. This means that a pro-growth, not an anti-growth policy is needed to solve the environmental problem. But the evidence for the environmental [[Simon Kuznets|Kuznets]] curve is quite weak. Also, empirically spoken, people tend to consume more products when their income increases. Maybe those products have been produced in a more environmentally friendly way, but on the whole the higher consumption negates this effect. There are people like [[Julian Simon]] however who argue that future technological developments will resolve future problems.

=== Human development theory ===
{{Main|Human development theory}}

Human development theory is a theory which uses ideas from different origins, such as [[ecology]], [[sustainable development]], [[feminism]] and [[welfare economics]]. It wants to avoid [[Normative economics|normative politics]] and is focused on how [[social capital]] and [[instructional capital]] can be deployed to optimize the overall value of [[human capital]] in an economy.

[[Amartya Sen]] and [[Mahbub ul Haq]] are the most well-known human development theorists. The work of Sen is focused on [[Capability approach|capabilities]]: what people can do and be. It is these capabilities, rather than the income or goods that they receive (as in the Basic Needs approach), that determine their well being. This core idea also underlies the construction of the Human Development Index, a human-focused measure of development pioneered by the UNDP in its Human Development Reports; this approach has become popular the world over, with indexes and reports published by individual counties, including the [[Measure of America|American Human Development Index and Repor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t in the United States. The economic side of Sen's work can best be categorized under [[welfare economics]], which evaluates the effects of economic policies on the [[well-being]] of peoples. Sen wrote the influential book '[[Development as freedom]]' which added an important [[ethical]] side to [[development economics]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qm8HtpFHYecC |title=Development as Freedom – Amartya Sen – Google Boeken |date= 2001-01-18|accessdate=2013-05-24|isbn=978-0-19-289330-7 |last1=Sen |first1=Amartya }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diederik Alexander Stapel''' (born 19 October 1966 in [[Oegstgeest]]) is a Dutch former [[professor]] of [[social psychology]] at [[Tilburg University]] and before that at the [[University of Groningen]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Diederik Stapel succeeds Theo Verhallen as Dean of the Tilburg School of Social and Behavioral Sciences |url=http://uvtapp.uvt.nl/fsw/spits.npc.shownewslettern?v_newsletter_id=9850426248424191 |publisher=[[Tilburg University]] |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Tilburg University suspended Stapel for [[Fabrication (science)|fabricating]] and [[Data manipulation|manipulating]] data for his research publications. This [[scientific misconduct]] took place over a number of years and affected at least 55 publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universonline.nl/2012/11/28/levelt-report-fraud-detected-in-55-publications/ |title=Levelt: fraud detected in 55 publications &amp;#124; Univers |publisher=Universonline.nl |date=2012-11-28 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Stapel obtained an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[psychology]] and [[Communication studies|communications]] from the [[University of Amsterdam]] (UvA) in 1991.&lt;ref name="cv_TU_for_students"&gt;{{cite news|title=Diederik Stapel succeeds Theo Verhallen as Dean of the Tilburg School of Social and Behavioral Sciences |url=http://uvtapp.uvt.nl/fsw/spits.NPC.ShowArticleN?v_article_id=7425424320095932&amp;v_newsletter_id=8823896128229022&amp;v_language=gb |date=8 July 2010 |accessdate=5 October 2011 |publisher=[[Tilburg University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402101814/http://uvtapp.uvt.nl/fsw/spits.NPC.ShowArticleN?v_article_id=7425424320095932&amp;v_newsletter_id=8823896128229022&amp;v_language=gb |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 he obtained his [[Ph.D.]] cum laude in [[social psychology]] from the UvA.&lt;ref name="cv_TU_for_students"/&gt; He became [[professor]] at the [[University of Groningen]] in 2000&lt;ref name="cv_TU_for_students"/&gt; and moved to [[Tilburg University]] in 2006, where he founded TiBER, the Tilburg Institute for Behavioral Economics Research.&lt;ref name="cv_TU_for_students"/&gt; In September 2010, Stapel became [[dean (education)|dean]] of the social and behavioral sciences faculty.&lt;ref name="cv_TU_for_students"/&gt;

Stapel received the "Career Trajectory Award" from the [[Society of Experimental Social Psychology]] in 2009, which has since been retracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Career Trajectory Award Recipients|url=http://www.sesp.org/trajectory.htm |accessdate=1 November 2011 |publisher=[[Society of Experimental Social Psychology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned his Ph.D. title to the University of Amsterdam in November 2011, noting that his "behavior of the past years are inconsistent with the duties associated with the doctorate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Redactie |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2686/Binnenland/article/detail/3026242/2011/11/10/Stapel-doet-vrijwillig-afstand-van-doctorstitel.dhtml |title=Stapel doet vrijwillig afstand van doctorstitel – Binnenland – VK |publisher=Volkskrant.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 Dutch media reported that Stapel had returned to work, teaching social philosophy at the Fontys Academy for Creative Industries in Tilburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/705115-diederik-stapel-doceert-bij-fontys.html|title=Diederik Stapel doceert bij Fontys|date=1 October 2014|work=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific misconduct==
In September 2011, Tilburg University suspended Stapel due to his fabrication of data used in research publications. The university announced an investigation of his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Prof. Diederik Stapel suspended |url=http://uvtapp.uvt.nl/fsw/spits.npc.ShowPressReleaseCM?v_id=4082238588785510 |publisher=[[Tilburg University]] |date=7 September 2011 |accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Enserink |first=Martin |title=Dutch university sacks social psychologist over faked data |magazine=[[Science (magazine)|Science]] |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/09/dutch-university-sacks-social.html |date=7 September 2011 |accessdate=17 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930010614/http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/09/dutch-university-sacks-social.html |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levelt Committee===

On 31 October 2011, a committee entrusted with investigating "the extent and nature of the breach of scientific integrity committed by Mr D.A. Stapel", formed by the Rector Magnificus of Tilburg University and chaired by [[Willem Levelt|Willem ("Pim") Levelt]], published an interim report regarding Stapel's activities at the three Dutch universities where he had worked.&lt;ref name="levelt1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Levelt Committee |title=Interim Report Regarding the Breach of Scientific Integrity by Prof. D. A. Stapel |date=31 October 2011|publisher=Tilburg University |accessdate= 17 January 2012|url=https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/upload/547aa461-6cd1-48cd-801b-61c434a73f79_interim-report.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interim report pointed to three unidentified "young researchers" as the [[whistleblowers]] for the case, and implies that these whistleblowers spent months making observations of Stapel and his work before they concluded that something actually was wrong. The report also cites two professors who claim they had previously seen examples of Stapel's data that were "too good to be true". The report concluded that Stapel made up data for at least 30 publications.&lt;ref name="levelt1"/&gt; His general method towards the end of his career was to develop a complete experiment at the level of theory, hypotheses, methods, stimuli, questionnaires, and even participants' rewards – and then pretend that he would run the experiments at schools to which only he had access. Instead of doing so, he would make up the data and send these to colleagues for further analysis. The report also stated that earlier in his career, going back at least to 2004, he appears to have manipulated data rather than faked them.&lt;ref&gt;Levelt, Oct. 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases he acted alone and the report did not find any indication that [[Collaborative editing|coauthors]], PhD students, or others were aware even in instances where suspicion may have been reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;Levelt, Oct. 2011, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; On page 6-7, the interim report names 19 Ph.D. theses prepared with data delivered by Stapel. Of those, seven have been cleared. There are various degrees of suspicion about the remaining 12. The report advised that the Ph.D. degrees of the students involved should not be retracted.&lt;ref name="levelt1"/&gt;

It became widely known that Stapel treated his graduate students unfairly, with most of them graduating without ever actually completing an experiment. Stapel controlled the data in his lab, and when students asked to see the raw data, they were often given excuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1 November 2011|title= Diederik Stapel: The Lying Dutchman |work=The Washington Post (Post Opinions) |accessdate=17 January 2012 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/achenblog/post/diederik-stapel-the-lying-dutchman/2011/11/01/gIQA86XOdM_blog.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, there were occasions when Stapel's data were given to an assistant to be entered into a computer. This assistant would then return the data file to Stapel. The researcher analyzing the data would then receive the file directly from Stapel. Stapel would apparently tell this researcher to "Be aware that you have gold in your hands." The report also suggests that Stapel elected to present a list of publications that contained fictitious data.&lt;ref name="levelt1"/&gt;

The interim report stated that it was not possible to determine whether Stapel fabricated or manipulated data for his 1997 [[dissertation]] at the University of Amsterdam, because the data had been destroyed. The university announced that it would investigate whether it would be possible to retract Stapel's Ph.D. because of exceptionally unworthy scientific behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uva.nl/actueel/nieuws/nieuws.cfm/8BF58B4E-702F-4206-993E1F3423C0EB66 |title=Commissie onderzoekt Amsterdamse werk Stapel – Nieuws en Agenda – Universiteit van Amsterdam |language=nl |publisher=Uva.nl |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127160850/http://www.uva.nl/actueel/nieuws/nieuws.cfm/8BF58B4E-702F-4206-993E1F3423C0EB66 |archivedate=27 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levelt, Oct 2011, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uva.nl/actueel/nieuws/nieuws.cfm/97DC3500-9DF4-447A-AE5827BA7E77F4E2 |title=UvA onderzoekt mogelijkheid intrekken doctorsgraad Stapel – Nieuws en Agenda – Universiteit van Amsterdam |language=nl |publisher=Uva.nl |date=31 October 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104040329/http://www.uva.nl/actueel/nieuws/nieuws.cfm/97DC3500-9DF4-447A-AE5827BA7E77F4E2 |archivedate=4 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stapel has since returned his degree himself (see above).

The interim report stated that Stapel had caused severe damage to young people at the beginning of their careers, as well as to the general confidence in science, in particular social psychology.&lt;ref name="levelt1"/&gt;  The University of Tilburg announced that it would pursue [[prosecutor|criminal prosecution]] of Stapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Callaway, Ewen |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/111101/full/479015a.html |title=Report finds massive fraud at Dutch universities |doi=10.1038/479015a |journal=Nature |date= 8 December 2011|accessdate=2011-11-17 |volume=479 |pages=15 |pmid=22051650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extensive report investigates all of Stapel's 130 articles and 24 book chapters.&lt;ref name="dutchnews.nl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2012/03/first_committee_findings_damn.php |title=First committee findings damn fraudulent Tilburg professor |publisher= Dutchnews.nl |date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A website was set up on 27 March 2012 to publish intermediate findings.&lt;ref name="dutchnews.nl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.commissielevelt.nl/ "Stapel Investigation website"], Joint Tilburg/ Groningen/ Amsterdam investigation of the publications by Mr. Stapel&lt;/ref&gt; According to the first findings, on the first batch of 20 publications by Stapel, studied by the "Levelt Committee", 12 were falsified and three contributions to books were also fraudulent.&lt;ref name="dutchnews.nl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nu.nl/wetenschap/2774144/diederik-stapel-heeft-nooit-excuses-aangeboden.html |title=Diederik Stapel heeft nooit excuses aangeboden |language=Dutch |publisher= nu.nl |date=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[de Volkskrant]]'' reported that the final report was due on 28 November 2012, and that a book by Stapel (''Ontsporing'', "Derailment") was to be released around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2672/Wetenschap-Gezondheid/article/detail/3354980/2012/11/28/Hoe-heeft-Stapel-de-wetenschappelijke-wereld-voor-de-gek-kunnen-houden.dhtml|title=Hoe heeft Stapel de wetenschappelijke wereld voor de gek kunnen houden?|date=28 November 2012|work=[[de Volkskrant]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''"We have some 30 papers in peer-reviewed journals where we are actually sure that they are fake, and there are more to come,"'' Pim Levelt, chair of the committee investigating Stapel's work stated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.com/5855733/psychologist-admits-to-faking-dozens-of-scientific-studies Psychologist admits to faking dozens of scientific studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coping with chaos===

A month after Tilburg University announced that it had found evidence of fraud in Stapel's work, the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' posted a retraction notice on Stapel's co-authored paper entitled ''Coping with chaos: How disordered contexts promote stereotyping and discrimination''.&lt;ref name="retractionwatch"&gt;{{cite web |last=Marcus|first= A. |title= ''Science'' drops other shoe in Stapel case, retracts recent paper on chaos |publisher=Retraction Watch |date=1 December 2011|accessdate=17 January 2012| url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2011/12/01/science-drops-other-shoe-in-stapel-case-retracts-recent-paper-on-chaos/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report from ''Science'' says:

:Our Report "''Coping with chaos: How disordered contexts promote stereotyping and discrimination''" (1) reported the effects of the physical environment on human stereotyping and discriminatory behavior. On 31 October 2011, the University of Tilburg held a press conference to announce findings of their investigation into possible data fraud on the part of author Stapel. These findings of the university's interim report (2) included fabrication of data in this Science paper. Therefore, we are retracting the paper, with apologies from author Stapel. Coauthor Lindenberg was in no way involved in the generation of the data, and agrees to the retraction of the paper.&lt;ref name="retractionwatch"/&gt;

In December 2011, Stapel retracted this paper, the first to be retracted. The journal expressed initial concern regarding the paper's validity on November 1.&lt;ref name="NatureBlog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Callaway |first=E. |title=Dutch psychology fraudster issues first retraction. |work=Nature (Nature News Blog) |date=1 December 2011|accessdate=17 January 2012|url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/12/stapel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a response to the retraction, coauthor of the ''Chaos'' paper Siegwart Lindenberg told the journal in an email, "Stapel's doing had caught me as much by surprise as it did anybody else. I never had any suspicion. He was a very trusted man, dean of the faculty, brilliant, successful, no indications for me to be distrustful. In this, I was not the only one. I also had no trouble with the results of the experiments."&lt;ref name="NatureBlog"/&gt;

===Meat eaters more selfish than vegetarians===

The research result, obtained by Stapel and co-workers [[Roos Vonk]] ([[Radboud University]]) and {{Interlanguage link multi|Marcel Zeelenberg|nl}} (Tilburg University), that meat eaters are more selfish than [[vegetarianism|vegetarians]], which was widely publicized in Dutch media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Meat eaters are selfish and less social |url=http://www.dutchdailynews.com/meat-eaters-selfish-less-social/ |date=30 August 2011 |accessdate=17 September 2011 |publisher=DutchDailyNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was suspected and later turned out to be based on falsified data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Meat eaters absolved, professor in the dock |url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/features/2011/09/meat_eaters_absolved_professor.php |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=17 September 2011 |publisher=DutchNews.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research result had not yet been published in a scientific journal; only a press bulletin was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vn.nl/Archief/Wetenschap/Artikel-Wetenschapmilieu/Onder-psychologen.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130222165141/http://www.vn.nl/Archief/Wetenschap/Artikel-Wetenschapmilieu/Onder-psychologen.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 February 2013 |title=Onder psychologen |last=Vanheste |first=Thomas |date=13 September 2011 |publisher=Vrij Nederland |language=Dutch |accessdate=31 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction by Stapel===
Responding to the interim report, Stapel stated:
{{quote|I failed as a scientist. I adapted research data and fabricated research. Not once, but several times, not for a short period, but over a longer period of time. I realize that I shocked and angered my colleagues, because of my behavior. I put my field, social psychology in a bad light. I am ashamed of it and I deeply regret it.
... I think it is important to emphasize that I never informed my colleagues of my inappropriate behavior. I offer my colleagues, my PhD students, and the complete academic community my sincere apologies. I am aware of the suffering and sorrow that I caused to them.
... I did not withstand the pressure to score, to publish, the pressure to get better in time. I wanted too much, too fast. In a system where there are few checks and balances, where people work alone, I took the wrong turn. I want to emphasize that the mistakes that I made were not born out of selfish ends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bd.nl/nieuws/tilburg-stad/stapel-betuigt-openlijk-diepe-spijt-1.121338 "Stapel betuigt openlijk 'diepe spijt'"]. Brabants Dagblad. 31 October 2011. Translated from Dutch: "Ik heb gefaald als wetenschapper, als onderzoeker. Ik heb onderzoeksgegevens aangepast en onderzoeken gefingeerd. Niet een keer, maar meerdere keren, en niet even, maar gedurende een langere tijd. Ik realiseer me dat ik door dit gedrag mijn directe collega's in verbijstering en boosheid heb achtergelaten en mijn vakgebied, de sociale psychologie, in een kwaad daglicht heb gesteld. Ik schaam me daarvoor en ik heb daar grote spijt van.&lt;br&gt;
...Ik hecht er aan te benadrukken dat ik hen nooit op de hoogte heb gebracht van mijn oneigenlijk gedrag. Ik bied mijn collega's, mijn promovendi en de gehele academische gemeenschap mijn oprechte excuses aan. Ik ben me bewust van het leed en het verdriet dat ik bij hen heb veroorzaakt.&lt;br&gt;
... Ik heb de druk te scoren, te publiceren, de druk om steeds beter te moeten zijn, niet het hoofd geboden. Ik wilde te veel te snel. In een systeem waar er weinig controle is, waar mensen veelal alleen werken, ben ik verkeerd afgeslagen. Ik hecht eraan te benadrukken dat de fouten die ik heb gemaakt, niet zijn voortgekomen uit eigenbelang."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his memoirs published in November 2012, Stapel admits his fraud, but protests against the accusation in the interim report that he was a cunning, manipulative fraud with a plan.

===Reaction in academia===
On 28 November 2012 the joint final report, from the three investigating committees, was published.&lt;ref name=final&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/nieuws-en-agenda/finalreportLevelt.pdf |title=Flawed science: The fraudulent research practices of social psychologist Diederik Stapel |author1=Levelt Committee |author2=Noort Committee |author3=Drenth Committee |date=28 November 2012 |accessdate=14 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112204021/http://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/nieuws-en-agenda/finalreportLevelt.pdf |archivedate=12 January 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that Stapel was able to continue his fraud for so long because of his status. At Tilburg he was "considered a star" and was seen by his colleagues and students as "charismatic, friendly and incredibly talented". Many students became his personal friends. But the final Levelt report raises more controversial questions about the ways in which Stapel went unchallenged for so long. The report concludes that there was "a more general failure of scientific criticism in the peer community and a research culture that was excessively oriented to uncritical confirmation of one's own ideas and to finding appealing but theoretically superficial ad hoc results". It goes on to suggest that "not infrequently reviews [of social psychology journal articles] were strongly in favour of telling an interesting, elegant, concise and compelling story, possibly at the expense of the necessary scientific diligence."&lt;ref name=jarrett&gt;Jarrett, C., "Stapel –  final report", in ''The Psychologist'' (News), Vol 26, Part 2 (February 2013), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

This aspect of the report has been criticised by the Social Psychology Section of the [[British Psychological Society]]. In a letter to the [[Times Higher Education Supplement]], on behalf of the Section, Stephen Gibson at [[York St John University]], points out ".. there are no grounds for concluding either that research fraud is any more common in social psychology than other disciplines or that its editorial processes are particularly poor at detecting it", adding that: "Our sub-discipline does not deserve the harm to its reputation that may be provoked by the careless implication of ''unique'' deficiencies." The Levelt report has also been criticised by the [[European Association of Social Psychology]] in an open letter to its members.

In the February 2013 issue of ''The Psychologist'', Willem Levelt, together with the chairs of the other two investigating committees, published a rejoinder to these and other criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;Drenth, P., Levelt, W. and Noort, E., "Flawed science?", in ''The Psychologist'' (Letters), Vol 26, Part 2 (February 2013), pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; Drenth et al. acknowledge that they did not compare the situation in social psychology with other disciplines, but note that "such a comparative investigation was not part of the Committees' commission."

In a review for the [[Association for Psychological Science]], Stapel's 315-page memoirs, entitled ''Ontsporing'' ("Derailed"), is described by Dutch psychologists [[Denny Borsboom]] and [[Eric-Jan Wagenmakers]] as "priceless and revealing". Stapel recounts that his misdemeanours began when he was sitting alone in his office and changed "an unexpected 2 into a 4". The reviewers describe the final chapter of the book as "unexpectedly beautiful" but note that it is full of lines taken from the works of writers [[Raymond Carver]] and [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref name=jarrett/&gt;

===Prosecution settlement===
In June 2013 Stapel agreed, in a settlement with the prosecutor, to perform 120 hours of [[community service]] and to lose the right to some benefits associated with his former job equivalent to 1.5 years of salary. In this way, he avoided further criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2013/06/28/diederik-stapel-treft-schikking-met-justitie-om-vervolging-te-voorkomen/ |title=Diederik Stapel treft schikking met justitie om vervolging te voorkomen |author=Frank Huiskamp |publisher=nrc.nl |date=28 June 2013 |accessdate=13 July 2013}} (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2013/06/stapel-gets-community-service-fo.html |title=Stapel Gets Community Service for Fabricating Studies |author=Yudhijit Bhattacharjee |publisher=sciencemag.org |date=28 June 2013 |accessdate=13 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706063903/http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2013/06/stapel-gets-community-service-fo.html |archivedate=6 July 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electronic engineering''' (also called '''electronics and communications engineering''')  is an [[electrical engineering]] discipline which utilizes nonlinear and [[active component|active]] electrical components (such as [[semiconductor device]]s, especially [[transistors]], [[diode]]s and [[integrated circuits]]) to design [[electronic circuit]]s, [[electronic device|devices]], [[VLSI]] devices and their [[electronic system|systems]]. The discipline typically also designs [[passive component|passive]] electrical components, usually based on [[printed circuit board]]s.

Electronics is a subfield within the wider [[electrical engineering]] academic subject but denotes a broad engineering field that covers subfields such as [[analog electronics]], [[digital electronics]], [[consumer electronics]], [[embedded systems]] and [[power electronics]]. [[Electronics]] engineering deals with implementation of applications, principles and algorithms developed within many related fields, for example [[solid-state physics]], [[radio engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[control systems]], [[signal processing]], [[systems engineering]], [[computer engineering]], [[instrumentation engineering]], [[electric power control]], [[robotics]], and many others.

The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) is one of the most important and influential organizations for electronics engineers.

== Relationship to electrical engineering ==
Electronics is a subfield within the wider [[electrical engineering]] academic subject. An academic degree with a major in electronics engineering can be acquired from some universities, while other universities use electrical engineering as the subject. The term [[electrical engineer]] is still used in the academic world to include electronic engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Allan R. Hambley ''Electrical Engineering'', pp. 3, 441, Prentice Hall, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-13-147046-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some people consider the term 'electrical engineer' should be reserved for those having specialized in power and heavy current or high voltage engineering, while others consider that power is just one subset of electrical engineering, as well as '[[electrical distribution]] engineering'. The term '[[power engineering]]' is used as a descriptor in that industry.  Again, in recent years there has been a growth of new separate-entry degree courses such as '[[systems engineering]]' and '[[communication systems engineering]]', often followed by academic departments of similar name, which are typically not considered as subfields of electronics engineering but of electrical engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6dEAAAAIAAj&amp;dq=electrical+vs+electronic+engineering&amp;lr= |title=Principles of Electrical Engineering |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Pansini ''Electrical Distribution Engineering'', p. xiv, The Fairmont Press Inc., 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-88173-546-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of electronic engineering}}
Electronic engineering as a profession sprang from technological improvements in the [[telegraph]] industry in the late 19th century and the [[radio]] and the [[telephone]] industries in the early 20th century. People were attracted to radio by the technical fascination it inspired, first in receiving and then in transmitting. Many who went into broadcasting in the 1920s were only 'amateurs' in the period before [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Erik Barnouw ''A Tower in Babel'', p. 28, Oxford University Press US, 1966 {{ISBN|978-0-19-500474-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To a large extent, the modern discipline of electronic engineering was born out of telephone, radio, and [[television]] equipment development and the large amount of electronic systems development during [[World War II]] of [[radar]], [[sonar]], communication systems, and advanced munitions and weapon systems. In the interwar years, the subject was known as [[radio engineering]] and it was only in the late 1950s that the term '''electronic engineering''' started to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zhdDAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=radio+engineering&amp;lr= |title=Radio Engineering Principles |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electronics ==
{{main|Electronics}}
In the field of electronic engineering, engineers design and test [[Electronic circuit|circuits]] that use the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] properties of [[electrical element|electrical components]] such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[diode]]s and [[transistor]]s to achieve a particular functionality. The [[Tuner (electronics)|tuner circuit]], which allows the user of a radio to [[electronic filter|filter]] out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit.

In designing an integrated circuit, electronics engineers first construct circuit [[schematic]]s that specify the electrical components and describe the interconnections between them. When completed, [[very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] engineers convert the schematics into actual layouts, which map the layers of various [[conductor (material)|conductor]] and [[semiconductor]] materials needed to construct the circuit. The conversion from schematics to layouts can be done by [[software]] (see [[electronic design automation]]) but very often requires human fine-tuning to decrease space and power consumption. Once the layout is complete, it can be sent to a [[fabrication plant]] for manufacturing.

For systems of intermediate complexity, engineers may use [[VHDL]] modeling for [[programmable logic device]]s and [[FPGA]]s.

[[Integrated circuit]]s, [[FPGAs]] and other electrical components can then be assembled on [[printed circuit board]]s to form more complicated circuits. Today, printed circuit boards are found in most electronic devices including [[television]]s, [[computer]]s and [[digital audio player|audio player]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Harper ''High Performance Printed Circuit Boards'', pp. xiii-xiv, McGraw-Hill Professional, 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-07-026713-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subfields ==

Electronic engineering has many subfields. This section describes some of the most popular subfields in electronic engineering; although there are engineers who focus exclusively on one subfield, there are also many who focus on a combination of subfields.

'''Signal processing''' deals with the analysis and manipulation of [[signal (information theory)|signals]]. Signals can be either [[analog signal|analog]], in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital]], in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information.

For analog signals, signal processing may involve the [[Amplifier|amplification]] and [[audio filter|filtering]] of audio signals for audio equipment or the [[modulation]] and [[demodulation]] of signals for [[telecommunication]]s. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the [[Data compression|compression]], [[error checking]] and [[error detection]] of digital signals.

'''Telecommunications engineering''' deals with the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[information]] across a [[channel (communications)|channel]] such as a [[coax cable|co-axial cable]], [[optical fiber]] or [[free space]].

Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a [[carrier wave]] in order to shift the information to a [[carrier frequency]] suitable for transmission, this is known as [[modulation]]. Popular analog modulation techniques include [[amplitude modulation]] and [[frequency modulation]]. The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.

Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a [[transceiver]]. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their [[power consumption]] as this is closely related to their [[signal strength]]. If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's information will be corrupted by [[signal noise|noise]].

'''Electromagnetics''' is an in-depth study about the signals that are transmitted in a channel (Wired or Wireless). This includes Basics of Electromagnetic waves, Transmission Lines and [[Waveguides]], Antennas, its types and applications with [[Radio frequency|Radio-Frequency]] (RF) and Microwaves. Its applications are seen widely in other sub-fields like Telecommunication, Control and Instrumentation Engineering.

'''Control engineering''' has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of [[Airliner|commercial airplanes]] to the [[cruise control]] present in many modern [[automobile|cars]]. It also plays an important role in [[industrial automation]].

Control engineers often utilize [[feedback]] when designing [[control system]]s. For example, in a [[automobile|car]] with [[cruise control]], the vehicle's [[speed]] is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the [[Internal combustion engine|engine's]] power output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, [[control theory]] can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback.

'''Instrumentation engineering''' deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as [[pressure]], [[Mass flow rate|flow]] and [[temperature]]. These devices are known as [[instrumentation]].

The design of such instrumentation requires a good understanding of [[physics]] that often extends beyond [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic theory]]. For example, [[radar gun]]s use the [[Doppler effect]] to measure the speed of oncoming vehicles. Similarly, [[thermocouple]]s use the [[Peltier–Seebeck effect]] to measure the temperature difference between two points.

Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the [[sensor]]s of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant. For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control engineering.

'''Computer engineering''' deals with the design of [[computer]]s and computer systems. This may involve the design of new [[computer hardware]], the design of [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]] or the use of computers to control an [[manufacturing|industrial plant]]. Development of [[embedded systems]]—systems made for specific tasks (e.g., mobile phones)—is also included in this field.  This field includes the [[micro controller]] and its applications.
Computer engineers may also work on a system's [[software]]. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of [[software engineering]], which is usually considered a separate discipline.

'''VLSI design engineering''' [[VLSI]] stands for ''very large scale integration''. It deals with fabrication of ICs and various electronic components.

== Education and training ==

Electronics engineers typically possess an [[academic degree]] with a major in electronic engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually three or four years and the completed degree may be designated as a [[Bachelor of Engineering]], [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Bachelor of Applied Science]], or [[Bachelor of Technology]] depending upon the university.  Many UK universities also offer [[Master of Engineering]] ([[MEng]]) degrees at the graduate level.

Some electronics engineers also choose to pursue a [[postgraduate]] degree such as a [[Master of Science]], [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in Engineering, or an [[Engineering Doctorate]]. The master's degree is being introduced in some European and American Universities as a first degree and the differentiation of an engineer with graduate and postgraduate studies is often difficult. In these cases, experience is taken into account. The master's degree may consist of either research, coursework or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy consists of a significant research component and is often viewed as the entry point to academia.

In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards certification and the degree program itself is certified by a professional body. Certification allows engineers to legally sign off on plans for projects affecting public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tryengineering.org/ask-expert/are-there-any-professional-examinations-available-electronics-and-telecommunications |title=Are there any professional examinations available in the electronics and telecommunications engineering field? Where do I get the listings of these examinations, and how do I apply for them? Who is eligible to write such examinations? |access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing a certified degree program, the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements, including work experience requirements, before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of Professional Engineer (in the United States, Canada, and South Africa), [[Chartered Engineer]] or [[Incorporated Engineer]] (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, and Zimbabwe), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia and New Zealand) or [[European Engineer]] (in much of the European Union).

A degree in electronics generally includes units covering [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[mathematics]], [[project management]] and specific topics in [[electrical engineering]]. Initially, such topics cover most, if not all, of the subfields of electronic engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more subfields towards the end of the degree.

Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as these help to obtain both a qualitative and quantitative description of how such systems will work. Today most engineering work involves the use of computers and it is commonplace to use [[computer-aided design]] and [[simulation software]] programs when designing electronic systems. Although most electronic engineers will understand basic circuit theory, the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, [[quantum mechanic]]s and [[solid state physics]] might be relevant to an engineer working on [[VLSI]] but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with [[embedded systems]].

Apart from electromagnetics and network theory, other items in the syllabus are particular to ''electronics'' engineering course. ''Electrical'' engineering courses have other specialisms such as [[machines]], [[power generation]] and [[Electricity distribution|distribution]]. This list does not include the extensive [[engineering mathematics]] curriculum that is a prerequisite to a degree.&lt;ref&gt;Rakesh K.

== Professional bodies ==

Professional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] (IEE) (now renamed the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] or IET). Members of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (MIET) are recognized professionally in Europe, as Electrical and computer (technology) engineers. The IEEE claims to produce 30 percent of the world's literature in electrical/electronic engineering, has over 430,000 members, and holds more than 450 IEEE sponsored or cosponsored conferences worldwide each year. [[SMIEEE]] is a recognised [[professional designation]] in the United States.

== Project engineering ==
For most engineers not involved at the cutting edge of system design and development, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time is also spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing budgets and determining project schedules. Many senior engineers manage a team of technicians or other engineers and for this reason, project management skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and strong written communication skills are therefore very important.

The workplaces of electronics engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electronics engineers may be found in the pristine laboratory environment of a fabrication plant, the offices of a consulting firm or in a research laboratory. During their working life, electronics engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including scientists, electricians, computer programmers and other engineers.

Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electronics engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency. And these are mostly used in the field of consumer electronics products.&lt;ref&gt;Homer L. Davidson, ''Troubleshooting and Repairing Consumer Electronics'', p. 1, McGraw–Hill Professional, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-07-142181-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emerging adulthood''' is a phase of the life span between [[adolescence]] and full-fledged [[adulthood]] which encompasses late adolescence and early adulthood, proposed by [[Jeffrey Arnett]] in a 2000 article in the ''[[American Psychologist]]''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnett | first1 = Jeffrey Jensen | year = 2000 | title = Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties | url = http://content.apa.org/journals/amp/55/5/469 | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 55 | issue = 5| pages = 469–480 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.55.5.469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It primarily describes people living in [[Developed country|developed countries]], but it is also experienced by young people in urban wealthy families in the [[Global south|Global South]].&lt;ref name=Galambos&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galambos|first1=Nancy|last2=Martinez|first2=M.

Arnett suggests emerging adulthood is the distinct period between 18 and 25 years of age where adolescents become more independent and explore various life possibilities. Arnett argues that this developmental period can be isolated from [[adolescence]] and [[young adulthood]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Emerging adulthood is a new demographic, is contentiously changing, and some&lt;ref name="Devin Ludwig"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/devin-ludwig/post_723_b_691244.html| title=  Challenges of the Young Adult Generation| last=  Ludwig| first=  Devin| publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]''| date=  August 23, 2010| accessdate =August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that twenty-somethings have always struggled with "identity exploration, instability, self-focus, and feeling in-between".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marantz Henig|first=Robin|title=What Is It About 20&amp;#8209;Somethings?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22Adulthood-t.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnett called this period "roleless role" because emerging adults do a wide variety of activities, but are not constrained by any sort of "role requirements".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The developmental theory is highly controversial within the developmental field, and developmental psychologists argue over the legitimacy of Arnett's theories and methods.

Coined by psychology professor Jeffrey Arnett, emerging adulthood has been known variously as "transition age youth",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Multisystemic Therapy for Emerging Adults With Serious Mental Illness and Justice Involvement|first1=Ashli J.|last1=Sheidow|first2=Michael R.|last2=McCart|journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Practice|volume=23|issue=3|date=August 2016|pages=356–367|doi=10.1016/j.cbpra.2015.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite|title=Addressing sexual health behaviour during emerging adulthood: a critical review of the literature|first1=Kamila A|last1=Alexander|first2=Loretta S|last2=Jemmott|first3=Anne M|last3=Teitelman|first4=Patricia|last4=D'Antonio|journal=Journal of Clinical Nursing|volume=24|issue=1-2|date=January 2015|pages=4–18|doi=10.1111/jocn.12640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref name= Walker/&gt; --&gt; "delayed adulthood",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Insights on Adolescence from a Life Course Perspective|first1=Monica Kirkpatrick|last1=Johnson|first2=Robert|last2=Crosnoe|first3=Glen H.|last3=Elder Jr.|date=March 2011|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|volume=21|issue=1, Special issue|pages=273–280|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00728.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; "extended adolescence", "youthhood",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Religious Zionist Singles and Late-Modern Youth Culture|first=Ari|last=Engelberg|journal=Israel Studies Review|volume=28|issue=2|year=2013|pages=1–17|doi=10.3167/isr.2013.280202}}&lt;/ref&gt; "adultolescence",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Book Reviews|year=2008|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=46|issue=4|pages=989-1041|doi=10.1257/jel.46.4.989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the [[twixter]] years".&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite|title=Lost in Transition: The Dark Side of Emerging Adulthood|first1=Christian|last1=Smith|first2=Kari|last2=Christoffersen|first3=Hilary|last3=Davidson|first4=Patricia Snell|last4=Herzog|publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online|date=January 2012|page=15|isbn=9780199828029|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199828029.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the various terms, "emerging adulthood" has become popular among sociologists, psychologists, and government agencies as a way to describe this period of life in between adolescence and young adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Precedent as a Policy Map: What Miller v.

Compared to other terms that have been used which give the impression that this stage is just a "last hurrah" of adolescence, "emerging adulthood" recognizes the uniqueness of this period of life.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; Currently, it is appropriate to define adolescence as the period spanning ages 12 to 18. This is because people in this age group in the United States typically live at home with their parents, are undergoing pubertal changes, attend middle schools and high schools and are involved in a "school-based peer culture". All of these characteristics are no longer normative after the age of 18, and it is, therefore, considered inappropriate to call young adults "adolescence" or "late adolescence". Furthermore, in the United States, the age of 18 is the age at which people are able to legally vote and citizens are granted full rights upon turning 21 years of age.&lt;ref name=arnett /&gt;

According to Arnett, the term "young adulthood" suggests that adulthood has already been reached, but most people in the emerging adulthood stage no longer consider themselves adolescents, but do not see themselves entirely as adults either.&lt;ref name=arnett&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnett | first1 = J. J. | year = 2000 | title = Emerging Adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 55 | issue = 5| page = 477 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.55.5.469}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, milestones such as finishing secondary school, finding a job, and getting married clearly marked the entrance to adulthood, but in modern, post-industrialized nations, as positions requiring a college degree have become more common and the average age of marriage has become older the length of time between leaving adolescence and reaching these milestones has been extended, delaying the age at which many young people fully enter adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=The Transitory Nature of Parent, Sibling and Romantic Partner Relationships in Emerging Adulthood|first1=Avidan|last1=Milevsky|first2=Kristie|last2=Thudium|first3=Jillian|last3=Guldin|publisher=Springer|year=2014|page=1|isbn=9783319066387|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UtIkBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;ots=8iOUHglJSG&amp;dq=%22The%20transition%20from%20adolescence%20to%20adulthood%20is%20a%20significant%20period%20in%20the%20life%20of%20an%20individual.%22&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the years 18–25 are classified as "young adulthood", Arnett believes it is then difficult to find an appropriate term for the thirties. Emerging adults are still in the process of obtaining an education, are unmarried, and are childless. By age thirty, most of these individuals do see themselves as adults, based on the belief that they have more fully formed "individualistic qualities of character" such as self-responsibility, financial independence, and independence in decision-making. Arnett suggests that many of the individualistic characteristics associated with adult status correlate to, but are not dependent upon, the role responsibilities associated with a career, marriage, and/or parenthood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Exploration of identity===
One of the most important features of emerging adulthood is that this age period allows for exploration in love, work, and worldviews more than any other age period. The process of identity formation emerges in adolescence but mostly takes place in emerging adulthood. Regarding love, although adolescents in the United States usually begin dating between ages 12 and 14, they usually view this dating as recreational. It is not until emerging adulthood that identity formation in love becomes more serious.&lt;ref name=arnett /&gt; Emerging adults are considering their own developing identities as a reference point for a lifetime relationship partner, so they explore romantically and sexually as there is less parental control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties|last = Arnett|first = Jeffrey|date = 2000|journal = American Psychologist|doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.55.5.469|pmid = |access-date =|volume=55|pages=469–480}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in the United States during adolescence dating usually occurs in groups and in situations such as parties and dances, in emerging adulthood, relationships last longer and often include sexual relations as well as cohabitation.&lt;ref&gt;Padgham, J.&amp;nbsp;J., &amp; Blyth, D.&amp;nbsp;A. (1991). "Dating during adolescence". In R.&amp;nbsp;M. Lerner, A.&amp;nbsp;C. Peterson, &amp; J.&amp;nbsp;Brooks-Gunn (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of adolescence'' (pp. 196-198). New York: Garland.&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as work, the majority of working adolescents in the United States tend to see their jobs as a way to make money for recreational activities rather than preparing them for a future career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bachman | first1 = J. G. | last2 = Schulenberg | first2 = J. | year = 1993 | title = How part-time work intensity relates to drug use, problem behavior, time use, and satisfaction among high school seniors: Are these consequences or just correlates? | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 220–235 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.29.2.220}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, 18- to 25-year-olds in emerging adulthood view their jobs as a way to obtain the knowledge and skills that will prepare them for their future adulthood careers. Because emerging adults have the possibility of having numerous work experiences, they are able to figure out what type of work they are good at as well find what type of work they want to pursue for the rest of their life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Undergoing changes in worldviews is a main division of cognitive development during emerging adulthood.&lt;ref name=perry&gt;Perry, W.&amp;nbsp;G. (1999). "Forms of ethical and intellectual development in the college years": "A scheme" San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. (Original work published 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

People in emerging adulthood that choose to attend college often begin college or university with the worldview they were raised with and learned in childhood and adolescence. However, emerging adults who have attended college or university have been exposed to and have considered different worldviews, and eventually commit to a worldview that is distinct from the worldview with which they were raised by the end of their college or university career.&lt;ref name=perry /&gt;

===Subjective difference===
When Americans between the ages of 18 and 25 are asked whether they believe they have reached adulthood, most do not answer with a "no" or a "yes", but answer with "In some respects yes, in some respects no".&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, J.J. (in press). Conceptions of the transition to adulthood from adolescence through midlife. ''Journal of Adult Development''&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear from this ambiguity that most emerging adults in the United States feel they have completed adolescence but not yet entered adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnett | first1 = J.J. | year = 1994a | title = Are college students adults?

A number of studies have shown that regarding people in their late teens and early twenties in the United States, demographic qualities such as completing their education, finding a career, getting married, and becoming parents are not the criteria used in determining whether they have reached adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnett | first1 = J.J. | year = 1997 | title = Young people's conceptions of the transition to adulthood | url = | journal = Youth &amp; Society | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 1–23 | doi=10.1177/0044118x97029001001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Arnett, J.J.

(1994, February). Adolescents becoming adults: Attributes for adulthood. Poster presented at the biennial meeting of the Society for Research on Adolescence, San Diego, CA&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the criteria that determine whether adulthood has been reached are character qualities, such as being able to make independent decisions and taking responsibility for one's self.&lt;ref name=alone /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greene, A. L. 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheer, S.D. 1994"/&gt; In America, these character qualities are usually experienced in the mid to late twenties, thus confirming that emerging adulthood is distinct subjectively.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Why emerging adulthood is distinct demographically===
Emerging adulthood is the sole age period where there is nothing that is demographically consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rindfuss | first1 = R. R. | year = 1991 | title = The Young adult years: Diversity, structural change, and fertility | url = | journal = Demography | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 493–512 | doi=10.2307/2061419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, C. (1995, April). "How old is young and young is old? The restructuring of age and the life course in Europe". Paper presented at Youth 2000: An International Conference, Middlesbrough, UK&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, adolescents in the United States up to age 20, over 95% live at home with at least one parent, 98% are not married, under 10% have become parents, and more than 95% attend school.&lt;ref name=census&gt;[[United States Census Bureau]]. (1997). "Statistical abstracts of the United States": 1997. Washington, DC: Author&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, people in their thirties are also demographically normative: 75% are married, 75% are parents, and under 10% attend school.&lt;ref name=census /&gt; Residential status and school attendance are two reasons that the period of emerging adulthood is incredibly distinct demographically. Regarding residential status, emerging adults in the United States have very diverse living situations.&lt;ref name=arnett /&gt; About one third of emerging adults attend college and spend a few years living independently while partially relying on adults.&lt;ref name="Goldscheider, F. 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldscheider | first1 = F. | last2 = Goldscheider | first2 = C. | year = 1994 | title = Leaving and returning home in 20th century America | url = | journal = Population Bulletin | volume = 48 | issue = 4| pages = 1–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrastingly, 40% of emerging adults do not attend college but live independently and work full-time.&lt;ref name="Goldscheider, F. 1994"/&gt; Finally, around two-thirds of emerging adults in the United States cohabitate with a romantic partner.&lt;ref&gt;Michael, R. T., Gagnon, J. H., Laumann, E. O., &amp; Kolata, G. (1995). "Sex in America: A definitive survey". New York: Warner Books&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding school attendance, emerging adults are extremely diverse in their educational paths (Arnett, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;470-471). Over 60% of emerging adults in the United States enter college or university the year after they graduate from high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bianchi | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Spain | first2 = D. | year = 1996 | title = Women, work, and family in America | url = | journal = Population Bulletin | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 1–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the years that follow college are extremely diverse – only about 32% of 25- to 29-year-olds have finished four or more years of college.&lt;ref name=census /&gt;

This is because higher education is usually pursued non-continuously, where some pursue education while they also work, and some do not attend school for periods of time.&lt;ref name=arnett /&gt; Further contributing to the variance, about one third of emerging adults with bachelor's degrees pursue a postgraduate education within a year of earning their bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mogelonsky | first1 = M. | year = 1996 | title = The rocky road to adulthood | url = | journal = American Demographics | volume = 18 | issue = 26–36| page = 56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, because there is so much demographic instability, especially in residential status and school attendance, it is clear that emerging adulthood is a distinct entity based on its demographically non-normative qualities, at least in the United States. Some emerging adults end up moving back home after college graduation, which tests the demographic of dependency. During college, they may be completely independent, but that could quickly change afterwards when they are trying to find a full-time job with little direction on where to start their career.

==Physiological development==

===Biological changes===
Emerging adulthood and adolescence differ significantly with regard to puberty and hormonal development.&lt;ref name="Eisenberg"/&gt; While there is considerable overlap between the onset of puberty and the developmental stage referred to as adolescence, there are considerably fewer hormonal and physical changes taking place in individuals between the ages of 18–25. Emerging adults have reached a stage of full hormonal maturity and are fully, physically equipped for sexual reproduction.

Emerging adulthood is usually thought of as a time of peak physical health and performance as individuals are usually less susceptible to disease and more physically agile during this period than later stages of adulthood. However, emerging adults are generally more likely to contract [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]], as well as to adopt unhealthy behavioral patterns and lifestyle choices.&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, J. (2012). Adolescence and emerging adulthood: A cultural approach. (5th ed.). Pearson Education Retrieved from http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205892493.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive development===
While many people believe that the brains of emerging adults are fully developed, they are in fact still developing into their adult forms. Many connections within the brain are strengthened and those that are unused are pruned away.&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;Beck, M. (2012). "Delayed Development: 20-Somethings Blame the Brain." Retrieved from https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443713704577601532208760746.&lt;/ref&gt; Several brain structures develop that allow for greater processing of emotions and social information. Areas of the brain used for planning and for processing risk and rewards also undergo important developments during this stage.&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt; These developments in brain structure and the resulting implications are one factor that leads emerging adults to be considered more mature than adolescents. This is due to the fact that they make fewer impulsive decisions and rely more on planning and evaluating of situations.

While brain structures continue to develop during emerging adulthood, the cognition of emerging adults is an area that receives the majority of attention. Arnett explains, "Emerging adulthood is a critical stage for the emergence of complex forms of thinking required in complex societies."&lt;ref name="Arnett, J. 2006"&gt;Arnett, J. (2006). "Emerging Adults in America, Coming of Age in the 21st Century." [[American Psychological Association]].&lt;/ref&gt; Crucial changes take place in their sense of self and capacity for self-reflection. At this stage, emerging adults often decide on a particular worldview and are able to recognize that other perspectives exist and are valid as well.&lt;ref name="Arnett, J. 2006"/&gt; While cognition generally becomes more complex, education level plays an important role in this development.&lt;ref name="Arnett, J. 2006"/&gt; Not all emerging adults reach the same advanced level in cognition because of the variety of education received during this age period.

===Abnormal development===
Much research has been directed at studying the onset of lifetime [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] disorders to dispel the common thought that most disorders begin earlier in life. Because of this reasoning, many people that show signs of disorders do not seek help due to its stigmatization. The research shows that those with various disorders will not feel symptoms until emerging adulthood. Kessler and Merikangas reported that "50% of emerging adults between the ages of 18 and 25 experience at least one psychiatric disorder." Not only is the emergence of various disorders prevalent in emerging adulthood, but the chance of developing a disorder drastically decreases at age 28.&lt;ref name="Kessler 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kessler | first1 = Ronald C. | last2 = Amminger | first2 = G.

Seventy-five percent of any lifetime DSM-IV anxiety, mood, impulse-control and substance abuse disorder begins before age 24.  Most onsets at this age will not be, or become, [[Comorbidity|comorbid]]. The median onset interquartile range of [[substance use disorder]]s is 18–27, while the median onset age is 20. The median onset age of mood disorders is 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kessler | first1 = RC | last2 = Berglund | first2 = P | last3 = Demler | first3 = O | last4 = Jin | first4 = R | last5 = Merikangas | first5 = KR | last6 = Walters | first6 = EE | year = 2005 | title = Lifetime Prevalence and Age-of-Onset Distributions of DSM-IV Disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication | url = | journal = Arch Gen Psychiatry | volume = 62 | issue = 6| pages = 593–602 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.62.6.593 | pmid=15939837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even disorders that begin earlier, like [[Spectrum approach#Broad spectrum approach|schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses]], can reveal themselves within the age range of emerging adulthood. Often, patients will not seek help until several years of symptoms have passed, if at all.&lt;ref name="Kessler 2007" /&gt; For example, those diagnosed with [[social anxiety disorder]] will rarely seek treatment until age 27 or later. Typically, symptoms of more severe disorders, such as [[major depression]], begin at age 25 as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Regier | first1 = Darrel A. | last2 = Rae | first2 = Donald S. | last3 = Narrow | first3 = William E. | last4 = Kaelber | first4 = Charles T. | last5 = Schatzberg | first5 = Alan F. | year = 1998 | title = Prevalence of anxiety disorders and their comorbidity with mood and addictive disorders | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1998-10311-004 | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 173 | issue = 34| pages = 24–8| pmid = 9829013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Melinda.

With the exception of some [[phobia]]s, symptoms of many disorders begin to appear and are diagnosable during emerging adulthood. Major efforts have been taken to educate the public and influence those with symptoms to seek treatment past adolescence. There is minimal but intriguing evidence that those who attend college appear to have less of a chance of showing symptoms of DSM-IV disorders. In one study, "they were significantly less likely to have a diagnosis of drug use disorder or nicotine dependence". In addition, "bipolar disorder was less common in individuals attending college". However, other research reports that chance of alcohol abuse and addiction is increased with college student status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanco | first1 = Carlos | last2 = Okuda | first2 = Mayumi | last3 = Wright | first3 = Crystal | last4 = Hasin | first4 = Deborah | last5 = Grant | first5 = Bridget | last6 = Liu | first6 = Shang-Min | last7 = Olfson | first7 = Mark | year = 2008 | title = Mental Health of College Students and Their Non–College-Attending Peers Results From the National Epidemiologic Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1998-10311-004 | journal = Arch Gen Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 12| pages = 1429| doi=10.1001/archpsyc.65.12.1429| pmc = 2734947 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships==

===Parent-child relationship===
Emerging adulthood is characterized by a reevaluation of the [[Parent|parent-child relationship]], primarily in regard to autonomy. As a child switches from the role of a dependent to the role of a fellow adult, the family dynamic changes significantly. At this stage, it is important that parents acknowledge and accept their child's status as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;Blos, P. (1985). "Son and father: Before and beyond the Oedipus complex." ''New York: Free Press''.&lt;/ref&gt; This process may include gestures such as allowing increased amounts of privacy and extending trust. Granting this recognition assists the increasingly independent offspring in forming a strong sense of identity and exploration at a time when it is most crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bartle-Haring | first1 = S. | last2 = Brucker | first2 = P. | last3 = Hock | first3 = E. | year = 2002 | title = The impact of parental separation anxiety on identity development in late adolescence and early adulthood | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Research | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 439–450 | doi=10.1177/0743558402175001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is varied evidence regarding the continuity of emerging adults' relationships with parents, although most of the research supports the fact that there is moderate stability. A parent-child relationship of higher quality often results in greater affection and contact in emerging adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Belsky | first1 = J. | last2 = Jaffee | first2 = S. | last3 = Hsieh | first3 = K. | last4 = Silva | first4 = P. | year = 2001 | title = Child-rearing antecedents of intergenerational relations in young adulthood: A prospective study | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 801–813 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.37.6.801}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attachment theory|Attachment styles]] tend to remain stable from infancy to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = E. | last2 = Weinfield | first2 = N.

However, if parents and children maintain a good relationship throughout the divorce process, it could act as a buffer and reduce the negative effects of the experience. A positive parent-child relationship after parental divorce may also be facilitated by the child's understanding of divorce. Understanding the complexity of the situation and not dwelling on the negative aspects may actually assist a young adult's adjustment, as well as their success in their own romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shulman | first1 = S. | last2 = Scharf | first2 = M. | last3 = Lumer | first3 = D. | last4 = Maurer | first4 = O. | year = 2001 | title = How young adults perceive parental divorce: The role of their relationships with their fathers and mothers | url = | journal = Journal of Divorce and Remarriage | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 3–17 | doi=10.1300/j087v34n03_02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahl | first1 = D | year = 2001 | title = The influence of parental divorce on the romantic relationship beliefs of young adults | url = | journal = Journal of Divorce and Remarriage | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 89–118 | doi=10.1300/j087v34n03_06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the increasing need for autonomy that emerging adults experience, there is also a continuing need for support from parents, although this need is often different and less dependent than that of children and earlier adolescents. Many people over the age of 18 still require financial support in order to further their education and career,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Semyonov | first1 = M. | last2 = Lewin-Epstein | first2 = N. | year = 2001 | title = The impact of parental transfers on living standards of married children | url = | journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 115–137 | doi=10.1023/a:1011081529592}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite an otherwise independent lifestyle. Furthermore, emotional support remains important during this transition period. Parental engagement with low marital conflict results in better adjustment for college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholson | first1 = J. | last2 = Phillips | first2 = M. | last3 = Peterson | first3 = C. | last4 = Battistutta | first4 = D. | year = 2002 | title = Relationship between the parenting styles of biological parents and stepparents and the adjustment of young adult stepchildren | url = | journal = Journal of Divorce and Remarriage | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 57–76 | doi=10.1300/j087v36n03_04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This balance of autonomy and dependency may seem contradictory, but relinquishing control while providing necessary support may strengthen the bond between parents and offspring and may even provide space for children to be viewed as sources of support.&lt;ref&gt;Aquilino, W. (2006). "Family Relationships and Support Systems in Emerging Adulthood." In J. J. Arnett (Ed.) ''Emerging adults in America: Coming of age in the 21st century.'' (pp. 193-217). Washington, DC, US: [[American Psychological Association]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Parental support may come in the form of co-residence, which has varied effects on an emerging adult's adjustment. The proportion of young adults living with their parents has steadily increased in recent years, largely due to financial strain, difficulty finding employment, and the necessity of higher education in the job field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Census Bureau agrees with parents: Yes, young adults still home |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/11/census-bureau-more-young-adults-live-with-parents.html |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic benefit of a period of co-residence may assist an emerging adult in exploration of career options. In households with lower socioeconomic status, this arrangement may have the added benefit of the young adult providing support for the family, both financial and otherwise.

Co-residence can also have negative effects on an emerging adult's adjustment and autonomy. This may hinder parents' ability to acknowledge their child as an adult,&lt;ref&gt;White, N. R. (2002). "Not under my roof! Young people's experience of home." ''Youth &amp; Society,34'', 214–231.&lt;/ref&gt; while home-leaving promotes psychological growth and satisfying adult-to-adult relationships with parents characterized by less confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, J. J. (2004). "Emerging adulthood: The winding road from the late teens through the twenties." ''New York: Oxford University Press.''&lt;/ref&gt; Living in physically separate households can help both a young adult and a parent acknowledge the changing nature of their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Dubas, J. S., &amp; Petersen, A. C. (1996). "Geographical distance from parents and adjustment during adolescence and young adulthood." In J. Graber &amp; J. Dubas (Eds.), "New directions for child development: Vol. 71. Leaving home: Understanding the transition to adulthood" (pp. 3—20). ''San Francisco: Jossey-Bass''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual relationships===
There are a wide variety of factors that influence [[sexual relationship]]s during emerging adulthood; this includes beliefs about certain sexual behaviors and marriage. For example, among emerging adults in the United States, it is common for [[oral sex]] to not be considered "real sex".&lt;ref name = "Eisenberg"&gt;Eisenberg, M. E. (2010). Sex in Emerging Adulthood: A Decade in the Sexual Gap.''Changing Sea''. Retrieved September 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s and 1960s, about 75% of people between the ages of 20–24 engaged in [[premarital sex]]. Today, that number is 90%.&lt;ref name = "Eisenberg" /&gt; [[Unintended pregnancy]] and [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections and diseases]] (STIs/STDs) are a central issue. As individuals move through emerging adulthood, they are more likely to engage in monogamous sexual relationships and practice [[safe sex]].&lt;ref name = "Eisenberg" /&gt;

Across most OECD countries, marriage rates are falling, the [[age at first marriage]] is rising,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/els/family/SF_3_1_Marriage_and_divorce_rates.pdf|publisher=OECD|work=OECD Family Database|title=Marriage and divorce rates}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cohabitation]] among unmarried couples is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/SF3_3_Cohabitation_rate_and_prevalence_of_other_forms_of_partnership_Jan2013.pdf|title=Cohabitation rate and prevalence of other forms of partnership|publisher=OECD|work=OECD Family Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Western European marriage pattern]] has traditionally been characterised by marriage in the mid twenties, especially for women, with a generally small age difference between the spouses, a significant proportion of women who remain unmarried, and the establishment of a [[Neolocal residence|neolocal household]] after the couple has married.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Linda. (2010). ''Kinship and Gender''. Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, pp. 231–36, {{ISBN|0813344026}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Phillipp R. (2003).

[[Housing affordability]] has been linked to [[Owner-occupancy|home ownership]] rates, and [[Demography|demographic research]]ers have argued for a link between the rising age at first marriage and the rising age of first home ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/submissions/housing-and-housing-finance/inquiry-into-home-ownership/home-ownership-rates.html|title=Home Ownership Rates - Submission to the Inquiry into Home Ownership June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/economists/tracy/7519_Transition_to_Homeownership.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mainstreet.com/article/why-first-time-homebuyers-are-waiting-to-buy-houses-until-after-marriage |title=Why First-Time Homebuyers Are Waiting to Buy a House Until After Marriage - MainStreet |date=13 April 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413021546/https://www.mainstreet.com/article/why-first-time-homebuyers-are-waiting-to-buy-houses-until-after-marriage |archivedate=2016-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universe.byu.edu/2011/10/11/average-age-of-first-time-homeowners-remains-high/ |title=Average age of first-time homeowners remains high – The Daily Universe |date=10 July 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710202225/http://universe.byu.edu/2011/10/11/average-age-of-first-time-homeowners-remains-high/ |archivedate=2016-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/11/record-share-of-young-women-are-living-with-their-parents-relatives/|title=Record share of young women are living with their parents, relatives|date=11 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Demographers distinguish between developing countries, which constitute more than 80% of the world's population,&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Development Programme (2006). Human Development Report, 2006. New York: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; and the economically advanced, industrialized nations that form the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). This includes countries like the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Australia, all of which have significantly higher median incomes and educational attainment and significantly lower rates of illness, disease, and early death.&lt;ref name="Cultural Psychology"&gt;Arnett, J.J.  (2011). "Emerging adulthood(s): The Cultural Psychology of a New Life Stage." In ''L.A. Jensen (Ed.)'', "Bridging cultural and developmental approaches to psychology: New Synthesis in theory, research, and policy," (pp. 255–275). New York: [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of emerging adulthood is specifically applicable to cultures within these OECD nations,&lt;ref name="Cultural Psychology"/&gt; and as a stage of development has only emerged over the past half century.&lt;ref name=" What Is It?"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnett | first1 = J. J. | year = 2007 | title = Emerging Adulthood: What Is It, and What Is It Good For? | url = | journal = Child Development Perspectives | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 68–73 | doi = 10.1111/j.1750-8606.2007.00016.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is specific to "certain cultural-demographic conditions, specifically widespread education and training beyond secondary school and entry into marriage and parenthood in the late twenties (or early thirties) or beyond".&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, J.J.  (2011). Emerging adulthood(s): The Cultural Psychology of a New Life Stage. In L.A. Jensen (Ed.), Bridging cultural and developmental approaches to psychology: New Synthesis in theory, research, and policy (pp. 255–275). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, emerging adulthood occurs only within societies that allow for occupational shifts, with emerging adults often experiencing frequent job changes before settling on particular job by the age of 30.&lt;ref name=" What Is It?"/&gt;  Arnett also argues that emerging adulthood happens in cultures that allow for a period of time between adolescence and marriage, the marker of adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arnett|first1=Jeffrey|title=Emerging Adulthood: A Theory of Development From the Late Teens Through the Twenties|journal=American Psychologist|date=2000|pages=469–480|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.55.5.469|volume=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such marital and occupational instability found among emerging adults can be attributed to the strong sense of individualization found in cultures that allow for this stage of development; in individualized cultures, traditional familial and institutional constraints have become less pronounced than in previous times or in unindustrialized/developing cultures, allowing for more personal freedom in life decisions.&lt;ref name=" What Is It?"/&gt; However, emerging adulthood even occurs in industrialized nations that do not value individualization, as is the case in some Asian countries discussed below.

Up until the latter portion of the 20th century in OECD countries, and contemporarily in developing countries around the world, young people made the transition from adolescence to young adulthood around or by the age of 22, when they settled into long-lasting, obligation-filled familial and occupational roles.&lt;ref name="Cultural Psychology"/&gt; Therefore, in societies where this trend still prevails, emerging adulthood does not exist as a widespread stage of development.

Among OECD countries, there is a general "one size fits all" model in regards to emerging adulthood, having all undergone the same demographic changes that resulted in this new stage of development between adolescence and young adulthood. However, the shape emerging adulthood takes can even vary between different OECD countries,&lt;ref name="Cultural Psychology"/&gt; and researchers have only recently begun exploring such cross-national differences.&lt;ref name=" What Is It?"/&gt; For instance, researchers have determined that Europe is the area where emerging adulthood lasts the longest, with high levels of government assistance and median marriage ages nearing 30,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Douglas | first1 = C.B. | year = 2007 | title = From duty to desire: Emerging adulthood in Europe and its consequences | url = | journal = Child Development Perspectives | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 101–108 | doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2007.00023.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to the U.S. where the median marriage age is 27.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Census Bureau]] (2009). Statistical abstract of the United States. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerging adult communities in East Asia may be most dissimilar from their European and American counterparts, for while they share the benefits of affluent societies with strong education and welfare systems, they do not share as strong a sense of individualization. Historically and currently, East Asian cultures have emphasized collectivism more so than those in the West.&lt;ref name="Cultural Psychology"/&gt; For instance, while Asian emerging adults similarly engage in individualistic identity exploration and personal development, they do so within more constrictive boundaries set by familial obligation. For example, European and American emerging adults consistently list financial independence as a key marker of adulthood, while Asian emerging adults consistently list capable of supporting parents financially as a marker with equal weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = L.J. | last2 = Badger | first2 = S. | last3 = Wu | first3 = B. | year = 2004 | title = The influence of culture in emerging adulthood: Perspectives of Chinese college students | url = | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 26–36 | doi=10.1080/01650250344000244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while casual dating and premarital sex has become normative in the West, in Asia parents still discourage such practices, where they remain "rare and forbidden".&lt;ref name="Cultural Psychology"/&gt; In fact, about 75% of emerging adults in the U.S. and Europe report having had premarital sexual relations by the age of 20, whereas less than 20% in Japan and South Korea reported the same.&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, E., &amp; Rapson, R. L. (2006). Love and sex: Cross-cultural perspectives. New York: University Press of America.&lt;/ref&gt;

While emerging adulthood exemplars are found mainly within the middle and upper classes of OECD countries, the stage of development still seems to occur across classes, with the main difference between different ones being length—on average, young people in lower social classes tend to enter adulthood two years before those in upper classes.&lt;ref name="Cultural Psychology"/&gt;

While emerging adulthood occurs on a wide scale only in OECD countries, developing countries may also exhibit similar phenomena in certain population subgroups. In contrast to those in poor or rural parts of developing nations, who have no emerging adulthood and sometimes no adolescence due to comparatively early entry into marriage and adult-like work, young people in wealthier urban classes have begun to enter stages of development that resemble emerging adulthood, and the amount to do so is rising.&lt;ref name="Cultural Psychology"/&gt; Such individuals may develop a bicultural or hybrid identity, with part of themselves identifying with local culture and another part participating in the professional culture of the global economy. One finds examples of such a situation among the middle class young people in India, who lead the globalized economic sector while still, for the most part, preferring to have arranged marriages and taking care of their parents in old age.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhary, N., &amp; Sharma, N. (2007). India. In J.J. Arnett (Ed.) International encyclopedia of adolescence (pp. 4420459). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is more common for emerging adulthood to occur in OECD countries, it is not always true that all young people of those societies have the opportunity to experience these years of change and exploration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Media==
Emerging adulthood is not just an idea being talked about by psychologists, the media has propagated the concept as well. [[Hollywood]] has produced multiple movies where the main conflict seems to be a "grown" adult's reluctance to actually "grow" up and take on responsibility. ''[[Failure to Launch]]'' and ''[[Step Brothers (film)|Step Brothers]]'' are extreme examples of this concept. While most takes on emerging adulthood (and the problems that it can cause) are shown in a light-humored attempt to poke fun at the idea, a few films have taken a more serious approach to the plight. ''[[Adventureland (film)|Adventureland]]'', ''[[Take Me Home Tonight (film)|Take Me Home Tonight]]'', ''[[Cyrus (2010 comedy-drama film)|Cyrus]]'' and ''[[Jeff, Who Lives at Home]]'' are comedy-dramas that exhibit the plight of today's emerging adult. Television also is capitalizing on the concept of emerging adulthood with sitcoms such as ''[[$h*! My Dad Says]]'' and ''[[Big Lake (TV series)|Big Lake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22Adulthood-t.html?_r=4&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;adxnnlx=1348760895-hf3X3qwNQJMSlhtRsTjX6Q | work=The New York Times | title=What Is It About 20-Somethings? | date=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is not just on television where society sees the world becoming aware of this trend. In spring 2010, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine showcased a picture of a post-grad hanging his [[PhD]] on the wall of his bedroom as his parents stood in the doorway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegloss.com/career/whats-the-matter-with-kids-today/|title=What's The Matter With Kids Today?|date=19 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People do not have to seek out these media sources to find documentation of the emerging adulthood phenomenon. News sources about the topic are abundant. Nationwide, it is being found that people entering their 20s are faced with multitudes of living problems creating problems that this age group has received a lot of attention for. The [[Occupy movement]] is an example of what has happened to the youth of today and exhibits the frustration of today's emerging adults. Other television shows and films showcasing emerging/early adulthood are ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', and ''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]].''

== Criticism ==

The concept of emerging adulthood has not been without its criticisms. Sociologists have pinpointed that it neglects class differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bynner|first=J.|date=2005|title=Rethinking the youth phase of the life course: The case for emerging adulthood?|url=|journal=Journal of Youth Studies|volume=8|pages=367–384|via=|doi=10.1080/13676260500431628}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it might be true that middle class children in Western societies are spoiled for choice and can afford to postpone life decisions, there are other young people who have no choices at all, and stay in the parental home not because they want to, but because they cannot afford a life of their own: They experience a period of "arrested adulthood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arrested adulthood: The changing nature of identity-maturity in the late-modern world.|last=Côté|first=James|publisher=New York University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more theoretical criticism comes from developmental psychologists, who regard all stage theories as outdated. They argue that development is a dynamic interactive process, which is different for every individual, because every individual has their own experiences. Inventing a stage that only describes (not explains) a time period in the life of a few individuals (mostly white middle class young people living in Western societies within this decade), and has nothing to say about people living in different conditions or different points in history is not a scientific approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hendry|first=L.

An '''estuarine turbidity maximum''', or ETM, is the zone of highest [[turbidity]] resulting from [[turbulence|turbulent]] [[sediment transport|resuspension of sediment]] and [[flocculation]] of [[suspended solids|particulate matter]] in an [[estuary]]. The turbulence is driven by tidal forces, waves, and [[density]]-drive currents that push a [[salt wedge]] upstream and beneath outflowing [[freshwater]] [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRETM-LMER What is an ETM?|url=https://depts.washington.edu/cretmweb/whatis.html|website=depts.washington.edu|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schuttelaars |first1=H.M |last2=Friedrichs |first2=C.T. |year=2002 |title=Formation of Estuarine Turbidity Maxima in Partially Mixed Estuaries |url=http://www.vims.edu/~cfried/cv/2002/Schuttelaars_etal_2002_PECS.pdf |dead-url= |journal=Proceedings, Physics of Estuaries and Coastal Seas, 11th International Biennial Conference, 17–20 September |location=Hamburg, Germany |volume= |issue= |pages=180–183 |doi= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=December 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Feathers: The Evolution of a Natural Miracle''''' is a 2011 [[natural history]] book by American [[Conservation biology|conservation biologist]] [[Thor Hanson (biologist)|Thor Hanson]]. Published by [[Basic Books]] and written for general audiences, the book discusses the significance of [[feathers]], their [[evolution]], and their history both in nature and in use by humans.

''Feathers'' is divided into five parts. In "Evolution", Hanson discusses the scientific debate over [[Feather#Evolution|how feathers evolved]], interviewing ornithologists [[Richard Prum]] and [[Alan Feduccia]], as well as paleontologist [[Xu Xing (paleontologist)|Xing Xu]]. In "Fluff", Hanson discusses how feathers play a role in [[Thermoregulation|regulating a bird's body temperature]] and how feather insulation has also been utilized by humans. "Flight" discusses how [[Origin of avian flight|flight might have evolved in birds]], interviewing Prum, Feduccia, Xu, and also ornithologist Ken Dial, who described [[wing-assisted incline running]]. In "Fancy", Hanson discusses the role of feathers in [[sexual selection]], as well as how humans have utilized feathers for fashion, interviewing costume and fashion designers on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] and New York City. "Function" discusses how feathers have been adapted for other purposes, such as [[waterproofing]], [[fly fishing]], and [[Quill|quill pens]].

Hanson decided he would write ''Feathers'' after going on a run and noticing a feather dropped at his feet by a vulture; coincidentally, he had considered writing a story involving vulture feathers earlier that day. The book was published first in hardcover by Basic Books in 2011, then in paperback in 2012. Critical reception to ''Feathers'' has predominantly been positive, with praise for Hanson's enthusiasm and writing. In 2012, ''Feathers'' won the [[Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association Award]] and the ''SB&amp;F'' Prize in the Young Adult Science Book category, presented by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and [[Subaru]]. In 2013, the book was also awarded the [[John Burroughs Medal]].

== Background and publication ==
Thor Hanson is a researcher with a variety of interests. In addition to writing for general audiences, his published research includes the impact of [[forest fragmentation]] on bird nest predation, the impact of [[War|human warfare]] on conservation policy, the behavior of [[Neotropical realm|Neotropical]] monkeys and birds, and others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thorhanson.net/research.html|title=Research|last=|first=|date=|website=Thor Hanson|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608233726/http://www.thorhanson.net/research.html|archive-date=8 June 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson received a Ph.D. from the [[University of Idaho]] in 2006; for his dissertation, he studied the impact of habitat fragmentation on the ecology of a type of tropical tree.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Hanson's interest in feathers began after observing [[vulture]]s in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/04/160539034/conservation-biologist-explains-why-feathers-matter|title=Conservation Biologist Explains Why 'Feathers' Matter|last=|first=|date=4 September 2012|website=NPR.org|publisher=NPR|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to Hanson, when brainstorming ideas for a new book, he considered a story which involved vultures and their feathers, and later that day, as he went on a run, he noticed four [[turkey vulture]]s keeping watch over a roadkill deer. One of the vultures began flapping and dropped a feather at Hanson's feet. Moved by this coincidence, Hanson decided then to write a book about feathers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/thor-hansons-feathers-a-delightful-inquiry-into-a-lightweight-miracle/|title=Thor Hanson’s ‘Feathers’: a delightful inquiry into a lightweight miracle|last=Wanner|first=Irene|date=16 June 2011|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=9 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309221032/https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/thor-hansons-feathers-a-delightful-inquiry-into-a-lightweight-miracle/|archive-date=9 March 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. xv-xvi&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basic Books]] first published ''Feathers'' in [[hardcover]] in 2011.

== Content summary ==
Following a preface and introduction, ''Feathers'' is divided into five main parts: "Evolution" discusses the [[Feather#Evolution|evolutionary history of feathers]], "Fluff" explains the role of feathers in [[thermoregulation|regulating body temperature]], "Flight" discusses the [[origin of avian flight]] as well as its impact on [[Aviation|human aviation]], "Fancy" discusses the role of feathers in [[sexual selection]] and human [[fashion]], and "Function" discusses the continuing evolution of feathers in both nature and human usage.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolution ===
[[File:Archaeopteryx lithographica, replica of London specimen, Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Karlsruhe, Germany - 20100925.jpg|thumb|A replica of [[Specimens of Archaeopteryx#The London specimen|the London specimen]], the ''Archaeopteryx'' specimen which Hanson first discusses in ''Feathers'']]
''Feathers'' begins with the 1861 discovery of the first ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' fossil specimen and the resulting debate between English paleontologist [[Richard Owen]], an opponent to [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]], and [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], an advocate for evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 17-22&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson himself visits the [[Wyoming Dinosaur Center]], a small museum in [[Thermopolis, Wyoming]], which had acquired an ''Archaeopteryx'' specimen.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 23-25&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson interviews [[Richard Prum]], the Coe Professor of Ornithology at [[Yale University]], who proposed a [[Evolutionary developmental biology|developmental theory]] of feather evolution, which focuses "on how feathers grow and not worrying about what they're used for."&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 37-39&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson also interviews [[Alan Feduccia]], a professor at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], who disagrees with the [[scientific consensus]] that birds evolved from [[Theropoda|theropod dinosaurs]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 40-41&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Hanson interviews [[Xu Xing (paleontologist)|Xing Xu]], a Chinese paleontologist who described fossil specimens that helped support Prum's developmental theory, such as ''[[Beipiaosaurus]]'' and ''[[Microraptor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 43-44, 51-52&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson also discusses the development of feathers in [[Slender-billed prion|thin-billed prions]], as well as how feather growth is controlled by the [[Sonic hedgehog]] gene.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 61-63, 77-79&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluff ===
In "Fluff", Hanson describes his experience at Winter Ecology, a "hands-on exploration of cold-weather ecosystems" organized by [[Bernd Heinrich]], a biologist at the [[University of Vermont]]. While staying in a log cabin in a remote location in western Maine, Hanson observed how [[golden-crowned kinglets]] and other birds were able to keep warm on nights when the temperature was {{Convert|-17|F|C}} and discusses the role of feathers in [[Thermoregulation|maintaining a comfortable body temperature]] for birds.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 84-87&lt;/ref&gt; To understand how [[down feather]]s have been adapted for human purposes, Hanson interviews Travis Stier at the [[Pacific Coast Feather Company]], which manufactures pillows and comforters made with feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Hanson discusses various strategies that birds employ to keep cool in warmer climates and during periods of muscular activity, such as flight and fast running, as well as the role of feathers in these strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 101-114&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flight ===
[[File:Peregrine Falcon (25336773440).jpg|thumb|left|A [[peregrine falcon]] in flight. In ''Feathers'', Hanson interviews the owner of a peregrine falcon whose dive was measured at {{Convert|242|mph|km/h}}, the [[Fastest animals|fastest flying animal]] on record.&lt;ref name="Frightful" /&gt;]]

Scientists disagree on [[Origin of avian flight|how feathered flight originally evolved]], and Hanson describes various viewpoints on the subject. The "ground-up" view holds that flight originated from theropod dinosaurs running along the ground, whereas the "tree-down" view holds that flight originated from animals who lived in trees "as a means to extend their hops from branch to branch".&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson discusses the issue with Feduccia, who argues for the "tree-down" view, noting that other vertebrates also developed flight from the tree down.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson also discusses with Prum and Xu, who state that while the origin of ''feathers'' might have been ground-based theropods, the origin of ''flight'' could have been theropods who climbed trees, especially considering four-winged feathered theropods like ''Microraptor''.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 124-25&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson interviews Ken Dial, an ornithologist who described [[wing-assisted incline running]] (WAIR), a behavior exhibited by baby birds learning how to fly. WAIR has been proposed as an alternative model for the origin of avian flight, as it addresses weaknesses in both the "ground-up" and "tree-down" views.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 125-27&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Hanson interviews Ken Franklin, who raised Frightful, a [[peregrine falcon]] whose dive was measured to be {{Convert|242|mph|km/h}}, making her the [[Fastest animals|fastest flying animal]] on record. Franklin describes the role of feathers in improving the aerodynamics of a falcon's flight.&lt;ref name="Frightful"&gt;Hanson, pp. 135-38&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson concludes the "Flight" section with discussion of how feathered flight has influenced human aviation.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 141-54&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fancy ===
[[File:Paradisaea apoda (male) -KL Bird Park-8a.jpg|thumb|upright|When discussing the work of [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], Hanson describes the brilliantly colored feathers of the male [[greater bird-of-paradise]], photographed here in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 160-61&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Hanson describes the behavior of [[Bird-of-paradise|birds-of-paradise]] and the role of their elaborate feathers in [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 157-69&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson also visits the [[Las Vegas Strip]] and observes how feathers play a role in pageant shows like ''[[Jubilee!]]''. Hanson interviews Marios Ignadiou, the head of ''Jubilee!''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s costume shop, as well as fashion designer Pete Menefree.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 171-73&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson then describes the history of the feather trade in fashion. In the period before [[World War I]], feathers were highly valuable commodities. Wanting to capitalize on the economic strength of feathers, the [[government of South Africa]] sponsored the Trans-Saharan Ostrich Expedition, led by Russel William Thornton to find the [[Barbary ostrich]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 178-79&lt;/ref&gt; After much adversity, Thornton and his crew returned to South Africa in 1912 with 127 surviving Barbary ostriches.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 183-84&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, demand for feathers in fashion decreased dramatically a few years later, once more women entered the workforce for the [[war effort]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson later interviews Leah Chalfen, a hat designer based in New York City who specializes in feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 191-94&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson also interviews Jodi Favazzo, the owner of the Rainbow Feather Company, which dyes feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 195-98&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Function ===
Hanson rescues a grounded [[common murre]] by carrying it back to the ocean (takeoff is extremely difficult for murres if they are not on water).&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 213-16&lt;/ref&gt; He then explains how the structure of feathers is waterproofing, keeping birds dry in wet conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 218-21&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson interviews John Sullivan, an experienced [[Fly fishing|fly fisher]] who explains the role of feathers in fly fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 224-31&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Hanson explains the history and use of feathers in [[Quill|quill pens]], which he uses as an example of how feathers have been adapted for other purposes beyond their natural evolutionary purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 234-43&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson also describes his experience observing the behavior of vultures in [[Kenya]], in which he discusses the lack of feathers on the heads of vultures.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 247-52&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson interviews Kimberly Bostwick, an ornithologist and curator at [[Cornell University]] [[Cornell Lab of Ornithology#Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates|Museum of Vertebrates]], who discusses her research in the [[club-winged manakin]], a bird whose feathers enable it to make sounds with its wings.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 253-61&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[National Museum of Natural History]], Hanson interviews Carla Dove, who works in the museum's Feather Identification Lab, which identifies the species of bird which a feather originates from.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, pp. 263-68&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Scientific American]]'' published an online review of ''Feathers'' in their blog ''Tetrapod Zoology'' by Darren Naish. Naish commented that prior to Hanson's book, "it doesn’t seem that any one book has ever been devoted to feathers and feathers alone. ... ''Feathers'' is thus a rather significant book, and very nice it is too." Naish also stated that "''Feathers'' is not the provincial view of someone only interested in ecology or conservation biology; on the contrary, this is a remarkably well-rounded review of the subject."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/thor-hanson-feathers-review/|title=Thor Hanson's Feathers: The Evolution of a Natural Miracle|last=Naish|first=Darren|date=7 May 2012|website=Scientific American: Tetrapod Zoology|publisher=Scientific American|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117085915/https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/thor-hanson-feathers-review/|archive-date=17 November 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review published in the news magazine ''[[Maclean's]]'', Brian Bethune praised Hanson's storytelling, writing, "For all the intriguing science, what really livens up Hanson's passionate discussion of his 'natural miracle' are the stories he tells."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bethune|first=Brian|date=13 June 2011|title=Feathers: The Evolution of a Natural Miracle|url=|journal=[[Maclean's]]|volume=124|issue=22|page=76|via=Business Source Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurence A.

=== Academic ===
[[Frances James (ecologist)|Frances C. James]], in a review published in ''[[The Condor (journal)|The Condor]]'', described the book as "scholarly and enjoyable", commenting that "Hanson has worked hard to summarize the science behind our current understanding of the form and function of feathers, their development and their evolution." Regarding Hanson's description of the origin of feathers and flight, James commented that Hanson could have taken "an even more critical approach" by stating that "Prum's developmental model has not really been tested ... Confirmation of the predictions of a theory is not a test unless the predictions help discriminate among alternative hypotheses." James eventually concluded, "I don't blame Hanson for not having delved more deeply into this subject.

Pepper W.

Trail also commented, "There are, however, a few places where the author's zest for telling a good story led him astray." As an example, Trail observed that Hanson uses eight pages to discuss the Trans-Saharan Ostrich Expedition, but "less than four on the science of feather coloration, a field burgeoning with new discoveries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trail|first=Pepper W.|date=|title=Feathers: The Evolution of a Natural Miracle|jstor=10.1086/669289|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|publisher=University of Chicago Press|volume=88|issue=1|pages=55–56|doi=10.1086/669289}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review published in ''[[The Wilson Journal of Ornithology]]'', Kimberly S.

'''Feature geometry''' is a [[Phonology|phonological]] theory which represents [[distinctive features]] as a structured hierarchy rather than a matrix or a set. Feature geometry grew out of [[autosegmental phonology]], which emphasizes the autonomous nature of distinctive features and the non-uniform relationships among them. Feature geometry recognizes that some sets of features often pattern together in phonological and phonotactic generalizations, while others rarely interact. Feature geometry thus formally encodes groups of features under nodes in a tree: features that commonly pattern together are said to share a parent node, and operations on this set can be encoded as operation on the parent node.

One node in feature geometries is the Laryngeal node. The Laryngeal node is an organizing node that dominates the features of the [[Distinctive feature#Laryngeal features|larynx]], usually taken to be [voice], [constricted glottis], and [spread glottis]. It is common for these three features to pattern together in the phonology of the world's languages to the exclusion of every other feature, and in feature geometry, this follows from the tree representation. Similarly, feature geometries generally include a Place node that is the dominant node of the [[Distinctive feature#Place features|place features]], which also often pattern together. Feature geometry is easily compatible with theories of [[underspecification]] and can represent incomplete segments by missing nodes.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The Root node is the topmost node of the feature tree and works as the formal organizing unit of the segment, and in some frameworks encodes the major class features such as [consonantal], [sonorant], and [approximant]. Some features such as [nasal] and [lateral] are sometimes dependent of the root node, or sometimes of a Supralaryngeal node along with Place. Other features such as [anterior] and [distributed] are usually dependent from the Coronal place feature.

The first formal model of feature geometry was introduced in print by [[Nick Clements|George N. Clements]] in 1985, drawing on unpublished work by K.P. Mohanon and Joan Mascaró. Another precursor to feature geometry was proposed by Roger Lass in 1976, in which he proposed a laryngeal feature submatrix within a distinctive feature matrix. Other important models have been proposed by Elizabeth Sagey (1986), John J. McCarthy (1988), and Clements &amp; Hume (1995). Models vary widely in the number of the hierarchical nodes and in how consonant and vowel features are treated.

Feature geometry has attracted formal and conceptual criticism. In 2003 [[Charles Reiss]] argued that feature geometry is insufficiently powerful to account for a class of phonological rules that involve dependencies between segments, such as partial and total identity and nonidentity. Feature geometry is unable to encode these properties. In 2008 [[Jeff Mielke]] argued that feature geometry merely recapitulated physiological organization, and that since the influence of articulation on [[sound changes|sound change]] will independently create patterns in the behavior of features, feature geometry recapitulates diachrony and is redundant as a theory of the mental organisation of phonology.

The '''fossa''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɒ|s|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|uː|s|ə}};{{r|2000Croke}} Malagasy {{IPA-mg|ˈfusə̥}}; ''Cryptoprocta ferox'') is a [[cat]]-like, carnivorous [[mammal]] [[endemic]] to [[Madagascar]]. It is a member of the [[Eupleridae]], a [[family (biology)|family]] of [[carnivora]]ns closely related to the [[mongoose]] family (Herpestidae). Its [[biological classification|classification]] has been controversial because its physical traits resemble those of [[Felidae|cats]], yet other traits suggest a close relationship with [[Viverridae|viverrids]] (most [[civet]]s and their relatives). Its classification, along with that of the other Malagasy carnivores, influenced hypotheses about how many times mammalian carnivores have colonized Madagascar. With genetic studies demonstrating that the fossa and all other Malagasy carnivores are most closely related to each other (forming a [[Cladistics|clade]], recognized as the family Eupleridae), carnivorans are now thought to have colonized the island once, around 18 to 20 million years ago.

The fossa is the largest mammalian [[carnivore]] on the island of Madagascar and has been compared to a small [[cougar]]. Adults have a head-body length of {{convert|70|-|80|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weigh between {{convert|5.5|and|8.6|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}, with the males larger than the females. It has semi-retractable claws (meaning it can extend but not retract its claws fully) and flexible ankles that allow it to climb up and down trees head-first, and also support jumping from tree to tree. The fossa is unique within its family for [[#External genitalia|the shape of its genitalia]], which share traits with [[Cat anatomy#Genitalia|those of cats]] and [[hyena]]s.

The species is widespread, although [[population density|population densities]] are usually low. It is found solely in forested habitat, and actively hunts both by day and night. Over 50% of its diet consists of [[lemur]]s, the endemic [[primate]]s found on the island; [[tenrec]]s, [[rodent]]s, lizards, birds, and other animals are also documented as prey. Mating usually occurs in trees on horizontal limbs and can last for several hours. Litters range from one to six pups, which are born blind and toothless ([[altricial]]). Infants wean after 4.5&amp;nbsp;months and are independent after a year. [[Sexual maturity]] occurs around three to four years of age, and life expectancy in captivity is 20&amp;nbsp;years. The fossa is listed as a [[vulnerable species]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. It is generally feared by the Malagasy people and is often protected by their ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'' (taboo). The greatest threat to the species is [[habitat destruction]].

==Etymology==
The [[name of a biological genus|generic name]] ''Cryptoprocta'' refers to how the animal's [[anus]] is hidden by its anal pouch, from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''crypto-'' "hidden", and ''procta'' "anus".{{r|1986Köhncke}} The [[specific name (zoology)|species name]] ''ferox'' is the [[Latin]] adjective "fierce" or "wild".{{Sfn|Borror|1960|p=39}} Its common name is spelled fossa in English or ''fosa'' in [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] from which it was taken,{{r|1986Köhncke|2009Blench_etal}} but some authors have adopted the Malagasy spelling in English.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=211–214}} The word is similar to ''posa'' (meaning "cat") in the [[Iban language]] (another Austronesian language) from [[Borneo]], and both terms may derive from [[trade language]]s from the 1600s. However, an alternative [[etymology]] suggests a link to another word that comes from [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''pusa'' refers to the [[Malayan weasel]] (''Mustela nudipes''). The Malay word ''pusa'' could have become ''posa'' for cats in Borneo, while in Madagascar the word could have become ''fosa'' to refer to the fossa.{{r|2009Blench_etal}}

== Taxonomy ==
The fossa was formally described by [[Edward Turner Bennett]] on the basis of a specimen from Madagascar sent by [[Charles Telfair]] in 1833.{{r|1833Bennett}} The common name is the same as the generic name of the [[Malagasy civet]] (''Fossa fossana''), but they are different species. Because of shared physical traits with [[civet]]s, [[mongoose]]s, and cats ([[Felidae]]), its [[biological classification|classification]] has been controversial. Bennett originally placed the fossa as a type of civet in the family [[Viverridae]], a classification that long remained popular among taxonomists. Its compact [[braincase]], large [[Orbit (anatomy)|eye sockets]], retractable claws, and specialized carnivorous [[dentition]] have also led some taxonomists to associate it with the felids.{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}} In 1939, [[William King Gregory]] and Milo Hellman placed the fossa in its own subfamily within Felidae, the Cryptoproctinae. [[George Gaylord Simpson]] placed it back in Viverridae in 1945, still within its own subfamily, yet conceded it had many cat-like characteristics.{{r|1986Köhncke}}{{Sfn|Yoder|Flynn|2003|pp=1253–1256}}

[[File:Cryptoprocta ferox.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The fossa has a cat-like appearance, resembling a small [[cougar]].{{r|1986Köhncke}}]]
In 1993, Géraldine Veron and François Catzeflis published a [[DNA hybridization]] study suggesting that the fossa was more closely related to mongooses (family [[Herpestidae]]) than to cats or civets.{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}}{{Sfn|Yoder|Flynn|2003|pp=1253–1256}} However, in 1995, Veron's [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] study once again grouped it with Felidae.{{Sfn|Yoder|Flynn|2003|pp=1253–1256}} In 2003, [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogenetic]] studies using [[Nuclear DNA|nuclear]] and [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genes]] by [[Anne Yoder]] and colleagues showed that all native Malagasy carnivorans share a common ancestry that excludes other carnivores (meaning they form a [[Cladistics|clade]], making them [[Monophyly|monophyletic]]) and are most closely related to Asian and African Herpestidae.{{r|2003Yoder|2004Veron|2007Barycka}} To reflect these relationships, all Malagasy carnivorans are now placed in a single family, [[Eupleridae]].{{r|MSW3}} Within Eupleridae, the fossa is placed in the subfamily [[Euplerinae]] along with the [[falanouc]] (''Eupleres goudoti'') and Malagasy civet, but its exact relationships are poorly resolved.{{r|MSW3|2003Yoder|2007Barycka}}

An extinct relative of the fossa was described in 1902 from [[subfossil]] remains and recognized as a separate species, ''[[Cryptoprocta spelea]]'', in 1935. This species was larger than the living fossa (with a body mass estimate roughly twice as great), but otherwise similar.{{r|1986Köhncke|2004Goodman}} Across Madagascar, people distinguish two kinds of fossa—a large ''fosa mainty'' ("black fossa") and the smaller ''fosa mena'' ("reddish fossa")—and a white form has been reported in the southwest. It is unclear whether this is purely folklore or individual variation—related to sex, age or instances of [[melanism]] and [[leucism]]—or whether there is indeed more than one species of living fossa.{{r|1986Köhncke|2004Goodman}}{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}}

==Description==
The fossa appears as a diminutive form of a large felid, such as a cougar,{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} but with a slender body and muscular limbs,{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}} and a tail nearly as long as the rest of the body.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} It has a [[mongoose]]-like head,{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}} relatively longer than that of a cat,{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} although with a muzzle that is broad{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}} and short,{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} and with large but rounded ears.{{r|1986Köhncke}}{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} It has medium brown eyes set relatively wide apart with pupils that contract to slits. Like many carnivorans that hunt at night, its [[Tapetum lucidum|eyes reflect light]]; the reflected light is orange in hue.{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}} 
Its head-body length is {{convert|70|-|80|cm|in|abbr=on}} and its tail is {{convert|65|-|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. There is some [[sexual dimorphism]], with adult males (weighing {{convert|6.2|–|8.6|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=or}}) being larger than females ({{convert|5.5|–|6.8|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=or}}).{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} Smaller individuals are typically found north and east on Madagascar, while larger ones to the south and west.{{r|1986Köhncke}} Unusually large individuals weighing up to {{convert|20|kg|lb|abbr=on}} have been reported, but there is some doubt as to the reliability of the measurements.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} The fossa can smell, hear, and see well. It is a robust animal and illnesses are rare in captive fossas.{{r|2003Winkler}}

[[File:Fossa (mammal) skulls.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cranium (dorsal, ventral, and lateral views) and mandible (lateral and dorsal views)]]
Both males and females have short, straight fur that is relatively dense and without spots or patterns. Both sexes are generally a reddish-brown dorsally and colored a dirty cream ventrally. When in [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]], they may have an orange coloration to their [[abdomen]] from a reddish substance secreted by a chest [[gland]], but this has not been consistently observed by all researchers. The tail tends to be lighter in coloration than the sides. Juveniles are either gray or nearly white.{{r|1986Köhncke}}{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}}

Several of the animal's physical features are adaptions to climbing through trees.{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}} It uses its tail to assist balance and has semi-retractable claws that it uses to climb trees in its search for prey.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} It has [[plantigrade|semiplantigrade]] feet,{{r|1986Köhncke}} switching between a plantigrade-like gait (when [[arboreal]]) and a [[digitigrade]]-like one (when [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]]).{{r|2007Mueller}} The soles of its paws are nearly bare and covered with strong pads.{{r|1986Köhncke}} The fossa has very flexible ankles that allow it to readily grasp tree trunks so as to climb up or down trees head first or to leap to another tree.{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}} Captive juveniles have been known to swing upside down by their hindfeet from knotted ropes.{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}}

The fossa has several [[scent gland]]s, although the glands are less developed in females. &lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|scent glands}}}|scent glands|Like herpestids it has a [[perianal]] skin gland inside an [[anal sac]] which surrounds the anus like a pocket. The pocket opens to the exterior with a horizontal slit below the tail. Other glands are located near the penis or vagina, with the [[penile glands]] emitting a strong odor. Like the herpestids, it has no [[prescrotal]] glands.{{r|1986Köhncke}}}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

===External genitalia===
[[File:The_Annals_and_magazine_of_natural_history;_zoology,_botany,_and_geology_(1916)_(14766334785).jpg|thumb|left|External genitalia of ''Cryptoprocta ferox'']]
One of the more peculiar physical features of this species is its external genitalia. The male fossa has an unusually long penis and [[baculum]] (penis bone),&lt;ref name="Ewer1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. F. Ewer|title=The Carnivores|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IETMd3-lSlkC|accessdate=28 March 2013|year=1973|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8493-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching to between his forelegs when erect, with an average thickness of {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The [[glans]] extends about halfway down the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|shaft]] and [[penile spines|is spiny]] except at the tip. In comparison, the [[Penis#Felidae|glans of felids]] is short and spiny, while that of viverrids is smooth and long.{{r|1986Köhncke}} The female fossa exhibits transient [[masculinization]], starting at about 1–2 years of age, developing an enlarged, spiny [[clitoris]] that resembles a male's penis. The enlarged clitoris is supported by an [[os clitoris]],{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}}{{r|2002Hawkins}} which decreases in size as the animal grows.{{r|2007Mueller}} The females do not have a pseudo-scrotum,{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} but they do secrete an orange substance that colors their underparts, much like the secretions of males.{{Sfn|Macdonald|2009|pp=668–669}} Hormone levels ([[testosterone]], [[androstenedione]], [[dihydrotestosterone]]) do not seem to play a part in this transient masculinization, as those levels are the same in masculinized juveniles and non-masculinized adults. It is speculated that the transient masculinization either reduces sexual harassment of juvenile females by adult males, or reduces aggression from [[territory (animal)|territorial]] females.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} While females of other mammal species (such as the [[spotted hyena]]) have a [[pseudo-penis]],{{r|2002Drea}} no other is known to diminish in size as the animal grows.{{Sfn|Macdonald|2009|pp=668–669}}

===Comparison with related carnivorans===
Overall, the fossa has features in common with three different carnivoran families, leading researchers to place it and other members of Eupleridae alternatively in Herpestidae, Viverridae, and Felidae. Felid features are primarily those associated with eating and [[digestion]], including tooth shape and [[facial]] portions of the skull, the tongue, and the [[digestive tract]],{{r|1986Köhncke}} typical of its exclusively carnivorous diet.{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}} The remainder of the skull most closely resembles skulls of genus ''[[Viverra]]'', while the general body structure is most similar to that of various members of Herpestidae. The permanent dentition is {{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.3-4.1|lower=3.1.3-4.1}} (three [[incisor]]s, one [[canine tooth|canine]], three or four [[premolar]]s, and one [[molar (tooth)|molar]] on each side of both the upper and lower jaws), with the [[deciduous teeth|deciduous]] formula being similar but lacking the fourth premolar and the molar. The fossa has a large, prominent [[rhinarium]] similar to that of viverrids, but has comparatively larger, round ears, almost as large as those of a similarly sized felid. Its facial [[vibrissae]] (whiskers) are long, with the longest being longer than its head. Like some mongoose genera, particularly ''[[Galidia]]'' (which is now in the fossa's own family, Eupleridae) and ''[[Herpestes]]'' (of Herpestidae), it has [[carpal]] vibrissae as well. Its claws are retractile, but unlike those of Felidae species, they are not hidden in skin sheaths. It has three pairs of nipples (one inguinal, one ventral, and one pectoral).{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}}{{r|1986Köhncke}}

==Habitat and distribution==
The fossa has the most widespread geographical range of the Malagasy carnivores, and is generally found in low numbers throughout the island in remaining tracts of forest, preferring pristine undisturbed forest habitat. It is also encountered in some degraded forests, but in lower numbers. Although the fossa is found in all known forest habitats throughout Madagascar, including the western, dry [[deciduous forest]]s, the eastern [[rainforest]]s, and the southern [[Madagascar spiny thickets|spiny forests]],{{Sfn|Dollar|Ganzhorn|Goodman|2007|pp=63–76}} it is seen more frequently in humid than in dry forests. This may be because the reduced [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] in dry forests provides less shade, and also because the fossa seems to travel more easily in humid forests.{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}} It is absent from areas with the heaviest habitat disturbance and, like most of Madagascar's fauna, from the central high plateau of the country.{{Sfn|Dollar|Ganzhorn|Goodman|2007|pp=63–76}}

The fossa has been found across several different elevational gradients in undisturbed portions of protected areas throughout Madagascar. In the Réserve Naturelle Intégrale d'Andringitra, evidence of the fossa has been reported at four different sites ranging from {{convert|810|to|1625|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{r|1996Goodman}} Its highest known occurrence was reported at {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}};{{Sfn|Albignac|1973|pp=1–206}} its presence high on the [[Andringitra Massif]] was subsequently confirmed in 1996.{{r|1996Goodman}} Similarly, evidence has been reported of the fossa at the elevational extremes of {{convert|440|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1875|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[Andohahela National Park]].{{r|1999Goodman}} The presence of the fossa at these locations indicates its ability to adapt to various elevations, consistent with its reported distribution in all Madagascar forest types.{{Sfn|Dollar|Ganzhorn|Goodman|2007|pp=63–76}}

==Behavior==
[[File:Fossa 085.jpg|thumb|right|Fossa are active both day and night ([[cathemeral]]).]]
The fossa is active during both the day and the night and is considered [[cathemeral]]; activity peaks may occur early in the morning, late in the afternoon, and late in the night.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} The animal generally does not reuse sleeping sites, but females with young do return to the same den.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} The home ranges of male fossas in [[Kirindy Forest]] &lt;!--(or Kirindy/CFPF, not to be confused with [[Kirindy Mitea National Park]] further south) --&gt;are up to {{convert|26|km2|abbr=on}} large, compared to {{convert|13|km2|abbr=on}} for females. These ranges overlap—by about 30&amp;nbsp;percent according to data from the eastern forests—but females usually have separated ranges. Home ranges grow during the dry season, perhaps because less food and water is available. In general, [[tracking collar|radio-collared]] fossas travel between {{convert|2|and|5|km|mi}} per day,{{r|1999Dollar}} although in one reported case a fossa was observed moving a straight-line distance of {{convert|7|km|abbr=on}} in 16&amp;nbsp;hours.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} The animal's population density appears to be low: in [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests#Kirindy Forest|Kirindy Forest]], where it is thought to be common, its density has been estimated at one animal per {{convert|4|km2|abbr=on}} in 1998.{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}} Another study in the same forest between 1994 and 1996 using the [[mark and recapture]] method indicated a population density of one animal per {{convert|3.8|km2|abbr=on}} and one adult per {{convert|5.6|km2|abbr=on}}.{{r|2005Hawkins}}

Except for mothers with young and occasional observations of pairs of males, animals are usually found alone, so that the species is considered solitary.{{r|1986Köhncke}}{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}}{{r|2005Hawkins}} A 2009 publication, however, reported a detailed observation of cooperative hunting, wherein three male fossas hunted a {{convert|3|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} sifaka (''[[Propithecus verreauxi]]'') for 45 minutes, and subsequently shared the prey. This behavior may be a vestige of cooperative hunting that would have been required to take down larger [[subfossil lemur|recently extinct lemurs]].{{r|2009Luhrs}}

Fossas communicate using sounds, scents, and visual signals. Vocalizations include purring, a threatening call,{{r|1986Köhncke}} and a call of fear, consisting of "repeated loud, coarse inhalations and gasps of breath".{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}} A long, high yelp may function to attract other fossas. Females mew during mating and males produce a sigh when they have found a female.{{r|1986Köhncke}}{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}} Throughout the year, animals produce long-lasting [[scent mark]]s on rocks, trees, and the ground using glands in the anal region and on the chest.{{r|1986Köhncke}}{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}}{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} They also communicate using face and body expression, but the significance of these signals is uncertain.{{r|1986Köhncke}} The animal is aggressive only during mating, and males in particular fight boldly. After a short fight, the loser flees and is followed by the winner for a short distance.{{r|1986Köhncke}} In captivity, fossas are usually not aggressive and sometimes even allow themselves to be stroked by a zookeeper, but adult males in particular may try to bite.{{r|2003Winkler}}

===Diet===
The fossa is a [[carnivore]] that hunts small to medium-sized animals. One of eight carnivorous species endemic to Madagascar, the fossa is the island's largest surviving endemic terrestrial mammal and the only predator capable of preying upon adults of all extant [[List of lemur species|lemur species]],{{r|1999Dollar|2005Patel}} the largest of which can weigh as much as 90&amp;nbsp;percent of the weight of the average fossa.{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}}{{r|2005Patel}} Although it is the predominant predator of lemurs,{{r|2005Patel|1995Wright}} reports of its dietary habits demonstrate a wide variety of prey selectivity and specialization depending on habitat and season; diet does not vary by sex. While the fossa is thought to be a lemur specialist in [[Ranomafana National Park]],{{r|1997Wright}} its diet is more variable in other rain forest habitats.
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=Microcebus murinus -Artis Zoo, Amsterdam, Netherlands-8c.jpg|image2=Diademed ready to push off.jpg|width=200|caption2=The fossa's diet includes small- ([[gray mouse lemur]], above) to medium-sized ([[diademed sifaka]], below) mammals.}}
The diet of the fossa in the wild has been studied by analyzing their distinctive [[feces|scats]], which resemble gray cylinders with twisted ends and measure {{convert|10|–|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1.5|–|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick.{{r|2008Hawkins}} Scat collected and analyzed from both Andohahela and Andringitra contained lemur matter and rodents. Eastern populations in Andringitra incorporate the widest recorded variety of prey, including both vertebrates and [[invertebrate]]s. Vertebrates consumed ranged from reptiles to a wide variety of birds, including both [[understory]] and ground birds, and mammals, including [[insectivore]]s, [[rodent]]s, and lemurs. Invertebrates eaten by the fossa in the high mountain zone of Andringitra include insects and crabs.{{r|1996Goodman|1999Goodman}} One study found that vertebrates comprised 94% of the diet of fossas, with lemurs comprising over 50%, followed by [[tenrec]]s (9%), lizards (9%), and birds (2%). Seeds, which comprised 5% of the diet, may have been in the stomachs of the lemurs eaten, or may have been consumed with fruit taken for water, as seeds were more common in the stomach in the dry season. The average prey size varies geographically; it is only {{convert|40|g|oz}} in the high mountains of Andringitra, in contrast to {{convert|480|g|oz}} in humid forests and over {{convert|1000|g|oz}} in dry deciduous forests.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} In a study of fossa diet in the dry deciduous forest of western Madagascar, more than 90% of prey items were vertebrates, and more than 50% were lemurs. The primary diet consisted of approximately six lemur species and two or three spiny tenrec species, along with snakes and small mammals.{{r|2008Hawkins}} Generally, the fossa preys upon larger lemurs and rodents in preference to smaller ones.{{r|1995Rasoloarison}}

Prey is obtained by hunting either on the ground or in the trees. During the non-breeding season the fossa hunts individually, but during the breeding season hunting parties may be seen, and these may be pairs or later on mothers and young. One member of the group scales a tree and chases the lemurs from tree to tree, forcing them down to the ground where the other is easily able to capture them.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} The fossa is known to eviscerate its larger lemur prey, a trait that, along with its distinct scat, helps identify its kills.{{r|2005Patel}} Long-term observations of the fossa's predation patterns on rainforest [[sifaka]]s suggest that the fossa hunts in a subsection of their range until prey density is decreased, then moves on.{{r|2009Irwin}} The fossa has been reported to prey on domestic animals, such as goats and small calves, and especially chickens. Food taken in captivity includes amphibians, birds, insects, reptiles, and small- to medium-sized mammals.{{r|1986Köhncke}}

This wide variety of prey items taken in various rainforest habitats is similar to the varied dietary composition noted{{r|1996Goodman|1999Goodman}} occurring in the dry forests of western Madagascar, as well. As the largest endemic predator on Madagascar, this dietary flexibility combined with a flexible activity pattern{{r|1999Dollar}} has allowed it to exploit a wide variety of niches available throughout the island,{{r|1996Goodman|1999Goodman}} making it a potential [[keystone species]] for the Madagascar ecosystems.{{Sfn|Dollar|Ganzhorn|Goodman|2007|pp=63–76}}

===Breeding===
[[File:Fossa-drawing.jpg|thumb|250px|Fossa illustration circa 1927]]

Fossas have a [[polyandrous]] mating system.&lt;ref&gt;Lührs, Mia-Lana, and Peter M. Kappeler. "[http://search.proquest.com/openview/f09f49ed849bea516e337be3fd1020e8/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=54055 Polyandrous mating in treetops: how male competition and female choice interact to determine an unusual carnivore mating system.]" Behavioral ecology and sociobiology 68.6 (2014): 879.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the details of reproduction in wild populations are from the western dry deciduous forests; determining whether or not certain of these details are applicable to eastern populations will require further field research.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} Mating typically occurs during September and October,{{r|1986Köhncke}} although there are reports of its occurring as late as December,{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} and can be highly conspicuous.{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}} In captivity in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], fossas instead mate in the northern spring, from March to July.{{r|2003Winkler}} [[Sexual intercourse|Intromission]] usually occurs in trees on horizontal limbs about {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} off the ground. Frequently the same tree is used year after year, with remarkable precision as to the date the season commences. Trees are often near a water source, and have limbs strong enough and wide enough to support the mating pair, about {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide. Some mating has been reported on the ground as well.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}}

As many as eight males will be at a mating site, staying in close vicinity to the receptive female. The female seems to choose the male she mates with, and the males compete for the attention of the female with a significant amount of [[animal communication|vocalization]] and antagonistic interactions. The female may choose to mate with several of the males, and her choice of mate does not seem to have any correlation to the physical appearance of the males.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} To stimulate the male to mount her, she gives a series of mewling vocalizations. The male mounts from behind, resting his body on her slightly off-center,{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} a position requiring delicate balance; if the female were to stand, the male would have significant difficulty continuing. He places his paws on her shoulders{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}} or grasps her around the waist and often licks her neck.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} Mating may last for nearly three hours.{{Sfn|Macdonald|2009|pp=668–669}} This unusually lengthy mating is due to the physical nature of the male's erect penis, which has backwards-pointing spines along most of its length.{{Sfn|Macdonald|2009|pp=668–669}} Fossa mating includes a [[copulatory tie]],{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} which may be enforced by the male's spiny penis.{{Sfn|Macdonald|2009|pp=668–669}} The tie is difficult to break if the mating session is interrupted.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} Copulation with a single male may be repeated several times, with a total mating time of up to fourteen hours, while the male may remain with the female for up to an hour after the mating. A single female may occupy the tree for up to a week, mating with multiple males over that time. Also, other females may take her place, mating with some of the same males as well as others.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} This mating strategy, whereby the females monopolize a site and maximize the available number of mates, seems to be unique among carnivores. Recent research suggests that this system helps the fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate-finding, such as low population density and lack of den use.{{r|2009Hawkins}}

The birthing of the litter of one to six{{r|2007Mueller}} (typically two to four){{r|1986Köhncke}} takes place in a concealed location, such as an underground den, a termite mound, a rock crevice, or in the hollow of a large tree{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} (particularly those of the genus ''[[Commiphora]]'').{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}} Contrary to older research, litters are of mixed sexes.{{r|1986Köhncke}}{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} Young are born in December or January, making the [[gestation period]] 90&amp;nbsp;days,{{r|1986Köhncke}} with the late mating reports indicating a gestational period of about six to seven weeks.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} The newborns are blind and toothless and weigh no more than {{convert|100|g|oz|abbr=on}}.{{r|1986Köhncke}}{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} The fur is thin and has been described as gray-brown{{r|2003Winkler}} or nearly white.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} After about two weeks the cubs' eyes open,{{r|1986Köhncke|2003Winkler}} they become more active, and their fur darkens to a pearl gray.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} The cubs do not take solid food until three months old,{{Sfn|Macdonald|2009|pp=668–669}} and do not leave the den until they are 4.5 months old; they are weaned shortly after that.{{r|1986Köhncke}}{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} After the first year, the juveniles are independent of their mother.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} Permanent teeth appear at 18 to 20 months.{{r|1986Köhncke}}{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} Physical maturity is reached by about two years of age,{{Sfn|Macdonald|2009|pp=668–669}} but [[sexual maturity]] is not attained for another year or two,{{r|1986Köhncke}}{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} and the young may stay with their mother until they are fully mature. Lifespan in captivity is up to or past 20 years of age, possibly due to the slow juvenile development.{{r|2007Mueller}}

==Human interactions==
The fossa has been assessed as "[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]]" by the [[IUCN Red List]] since 2008, as its population size has probably declined by at least 30&amp;nbsp;percent between 1987 and 2008; previous assessments have included "[[Endangered species|Endangered]]" (2000) and "Insufficiently Known" (1988, 1990, 1994).{{r|IUCN}} The species is dependent on forest and thus threatened by the widespread destruction of Madagascar's native forest but is also able to persist in disturbed areas.{{Sfn|Hawkins|2003|pp=1360–1363}}{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} A suite of [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] markers (short segments of DNA that have a repeated [[DNA sequence|sequence]]) have been developed to help aid in studies of genetic health and [[population dynamics]] of both captive and wild fossas.{{r|2009Vogler}} Several [[pathogen]]s have been isolated from the fossa, some of which, such as [[anthrax]] and [[canine distemper]], are thought to have been transmitted by feral dogs or cats.{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' was reported in a captive fossa in 2013.&lt;ref name="2013Garcia"/&gt;

Although the species is widely distributed, it is locally rare in all regions, making fossas particularly vulnerable to extinction. The effects of [[habitat fragmentation]] increase the risk. For its size, the fossa has a lower than predicted population density, which is further threatened by Madagascar's rapidly disappearing forests and dwindling lemur populations, which make up a high proportion of its diet. The loss of the fossa, either locally or completely, could significantly impact ecosystem dynamics, possibly leading to over-grazing by some of its prey species. The total population of the fossa living within protected areas is estimated at less than 2,500&amp;nbsp;adults, but this may be an overestimate. Only two protected areas are thought to contain 500 or more adult fossas: [[Masoala National Park]] and [[Midongy du sud National Park|Midongy-Sud National Park]], although these are also thought to be overestimated. Too little population information has been collected for a formal [[population viability analysis]], but estimates suggest that none of the protected areas support a [[Small population size|viable population]]. If this is correct, the extinction of the fossa may take as much as 100&amp;nbsp;years to occur as the species gradually declines. In order for the species to survive, it is estimated that at least {{convert|555|km2|abbr=on}} is needed to maintain smaller, short-term viable populations, and at least {{convert|2000|km2|abbr=on}} for populations of 500 adults.{{r|2005Hawkins}}

[[Taboo]], known in Madagascar as ''fady'',{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|p=101}} offers protection for the fossa and other carnivores.{{r|2007Jones}} In the Marolambo District (part of the [[Atsinanana]] region in [[Toamasina Province]]), the fossa has traditionally been hated and feared as a dangerous animal. It has been described as "greedy and aggressive", known for taking fowl and piglets, and believed to "take little children who walk alone into the forest". Some do not eat it for fear that it will transfer its undesirable qualities to anyone who consumes it.{{Sfn|Ruud|1970|p=101}} However, the animal is also taken for [[bushmeat]];{{Sfn|Goodman|2009|loc=Family Eupleridae (Madagascar Carnivores)}} a study published in 2009 reported that 57&amp;nbsp;percent of villages (8 of 14 sampled) in the Makira forest consume fossa meat. The animals were typically hunted using slingshots, with dogs, or most commonly, by placing [[snare trap]]s on animal paths.{{r|2009Golden}} Near [[Ranomafana National Park]], the fossa, along with several of its smaller cousins and the introduced [[small Indian civet]] (''Viverricula indica''), are known to "scavenge on the bodies of ancestors", which are buried in shallow graves in the forest. For this reason, eating these animals is strictly prohibited by ''fady''. However, if they wander into villages in search of domestic fowl, they may be killed or trapped. Small carnivore traps have been observed near chicken runs in the village of Vohiparara.{{r|2007Jones}}

Fossas are occasionally held in captivity in [[zoo]]s. They first bred in captivity in 1974 in the zoo of [[Montpellier]], France. The next year, at a time when there were only eight fossas in the world's zoos, the [[Duisburg Zoo]] in Germany acquired one; this zoo later started a successful breeding program, and most zoo fossas now descend from the Duisburg population. Research on the Duisburg fossas has provided much data about their biology.{{r|2003Winkler}}

The fossa was depicted as an antagonist in the DreamWorks 2005 animated film [[Madagascar (2005 film)|''Madagascar'']], accurately shown as the lemurs' most feared predator.{{r|2005Independent}}

'''George Fryer Sternberg''' (1883–1969) was a paleontologist best known for his discovery in [[Gove County, Kansas|Gove County]], [[Kansas]] of the "fish-within-a-fish" of ''[[Xiphactinus audax]]'' with a recently eaten ''[[Gillicus arcuatus]]'' within its stomach. He was the son of [[Charles Hazelius Sternberg]] and nephew of [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[George M. Sternberg]] (1838–1915). The [[Sternberg Museum of Natural History]] at [[Fort Hays State University]] in [[Hays, Kansas]] is named for him and other members of his fossil collecting family like his father Charles Hazelius Sternberg (1850–1943), or his brother [[Charles Mortram Sternberg]] (1885–1981).

'''''Hausberg''''' (lit.: "house mountain", plural: ''Hausberge'') is German for a prominent mountain or hill in the immediate vicinity of a village, town or city, usually located on its municipal territory, but outside the built up area. It means something like the "local mountain" or "local hill" closely associated with a settlement by its population. The ''Hausberg'' forms a backdrop to its home settlement and also offers a prominent viewing point looking over the settlement. As a result, many ''Hausberge'' have [[Aerial lift|cable cars]] or [[gondola lift]]s to transport visitors to the top. "Hausberg" is also the proper name of numerous local mountains and hills in German-speaking countries.

The ''Hausberg'' does not have to lie within the town's municipal boundaries: The [[Pfänder]], the ''Hausberg'' of the town of [[Bregenz]] in [[Austria]], is in the municipality of [[Lochau]] and the highest summit of the [[Pilatus (mountain)|Pilatus]], the ''Hausberg'' of [[Lucerne]], is even just outside the [[Canton of Lucerne]].

A hill within a town or city itself is usually referred to in German as a ''Stadtberg''.

'''Henry Hindley''' (1701–1771) was an 18th-century [[clockmaker]], watchmaker and maker of scientific instruments. He invented a [[screw-cutting lathe]], a fusee-cutting engine and an improved wheel-cutting engine and made one of the first [[dividing engine]]s,&lt;ref name="daumas"&gt;''Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth centuries and their Makers'', Portman Books, London 1989  {{ISBN|978-0-7134-0727-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the construction of accurately-graduated arcs on scientific instruments. He is thought to have made the world's first equatorially-mounted [[telescope]], which can now be seen in [[Burton Constable Hall]].

Hindley was a Roman Catholic, born in Wigan (Lancs) in 1701. He was apprenticed and made clocks in Wigan from 1726 to 1730 and moved to York in 1731, where he was established first in Petergate and then Stonegate from 1741 until his death in 1771. [[John Smeaton]]'s cousin John Holmes was apprenticed to Hindley.&lt;ref&gt;Loomes, ''Watch and Clock Makers of the World'', NAG Press, London 2006 {{ISBN|0-7198-0330-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by his son, who died in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Loomes 'Watch and Clockmakers of the World' NAG Press London, 2006 {{ISBN|0-7198-0330-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of his surviving clocks are high quality long-case clocks featuring long going and the use of deadbeat escapements, six spoke wheels, high count trains and repeating, enclosed movements. A year-going clock with a bolt-and-shutter maintaining power is in the Castle Museum York, together with four eight-day clocks. A further example, a Hindley movement of around 1740 fitted into a walnut marquetry case of ca. 1690, is at Temple Newsome House (Leeds).&lt;ref&gt;.''Clocks'' magazine Jan 1985 pp. 19 &amp; 20&lt;/ref&gt; Others exist in private collections

He made turret clocks such as those for York Minster (much modified over the years) and [[Bar Convent]]. One of his bracket clocks may also be seen in York Minster. He made watches in some numbers:&lt;ref&gt;J.R.M. Setchell, in ''Transactions of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society'', 1972&lt;/ref&gt; examples exist in the Science Museum, the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum as well as the Castle Museum, York.

[[Aluminium]] or aluminum is a [[chemical element]] with symbol Al and [[atomic number]] 13. At [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard conditions]], aluminium forms a bright silvery metal; this metal is unusually light and resistant against corrosion. Chemically, aluminium is a [[main-group element]] that normally assumes the +3 [[oxidation state]]. Aluminium is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust;&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenwood |first1=Norman N. |authorlink1=Norman Greenwood |last2=Earnshaw |first2=Alan |year=1997 |title=Chemistry of the Elements |edition=2 |page=217 |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]] |isbn=978-0-08-037941-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as such, it is widespread in human-related activities. Aluminium is produced in tens of millions of [[metric ton]]s; the metal is commonly alloyed to improve some characteristics, such as [[hardness]]. Aluminium has no biological role but is not particularly toxic.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|title-link=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|last1=Frank|first1=W. B.|date=2009|publisher=[[Wiley-VCH]]|isbn=978-3527306732|chapter=Aluminum|doi=10.1002/14356007.a01_459.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aluminium compound [[alum]] has been known since the 5th century BCE and was extensively used by ancients for dyeing and city defense; during the [[Middle Ages]], the former use made alum a subject of international commerce. Scientists of the [[Renaissance]] believed alum was a salt of a new [[Earth (chemistry)|earth]]; during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], it was established that the earth was an oxide of a new metal. Discovery of this metal was announced in 1825 by Danish physicist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]], whose work was extended by German chemist [[Friedrich Wöhler]].

Aluminium was difficult to refine and thus uncommon in actual usage. Soon after its discovery, the price of aluminium exceeded that of gold and was only reduced after the initiation of the first industrial production by French chemist [[Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville]] in 1856. Aluminium became much more available to the general public with the [[Hall–Héroult process]] independently developed by French engineer [[Paul Héroult]] and American engineer [[Charles Martin Hall]] in 1886 and the [[Bayer process]] developed by Austrian chemist [[Carl Joseph Bayer]] in 1889. These processes have been used for aluminium production up to the present.

Introduction of these methods to mass production of aluminium led to the extensive use of the metal in industry and everyday lives. Aluminium has been used in aviation, engineering, construction, and packaging thanks to its lightness and resistance against corrosion. Its production grew exponentially in the 20th century and it became an exchange commodity in the 1970s. In 1900, production was 6,800 metric tons; in 2015, it was 57,500,000 tons.

== Early history ==

[[File:Alum.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=White crystals of alum on a glass-like plate|[[Alum]]]]

The history of aluminium was shaped by the usage of its compound [[alum]]. The first written record of alum was made in the 5th century BCE by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]].{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=12}} Ancients used alum as dyeing mordants, in medicine, as a fire-resistant coating for wood, and in [[chemical milling]].{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=12–14}} Aluminium metal was unknown. Roman historian [[Pliny the Elder]] recorded a story about a metal bright as silver but much lighter. The metal was presented to the Emperor [[Tiberius]] (reigned 14–37 CE), who had the discoverer killed so the metal would not diminish the value of his gold and silver assets.{{efn|"One day a goldsmith in Rome was allowed to show the Emperor [[Tiberius]] a dinner plate of a new metal. The plate was very light, and almost as bright as silver. The goldsmith told the Emperor that he had made the metal from plain clay. He also assured the Emperor that only he, himself, and the Gods knew how to produce this metal from clay. The Emperor became very interested, and as a financial expert he was also a little concerned. The Emperor felt immediately, however, that all his treasures of gold and silver would decline in value if people started to produce this bright metal of clay. Therefore, instead of giving the goldsmith the regard expected, he ordered him to be beheaded."&lt;ref name=Eskin&gt;{{Cite book|last=Eskin|first=Dmitry|year=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lJTZo6sj-BkC&amp;dq=9781420062823|title=Physical metallurgy of direct chill casting of aluminum alloys|page=1|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-6282-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Some sources suggest this metal could be aluminium,{{efn|Deville had established that heating a mixture of [[sodium chloride]], clay, and charcoal yields numerous aluminium globules. This was published in the [[Comptes rendus de l'Académie des Sciences|Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences]] but eventually forgotten.&lt;ref name="Duboin1902"/&gt; French chemist André Duboin discovered that heating a mixture of [[borax]], alumina, and smaller quantities of [[dichromate]] and [[silica]] in a crucible formed impure aluminium. [[Boric acid]] is abundant in Italy. This hints at the possibility that boric acid, potash, and clay under the reducing influence of coal may have produced aluminium in Rome.&lt;ref name="Duboin1902"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duboin |first=A. |year=1902 |title=Les Romains ont-ils connu l'aluminium ? |trans-title=Did the Romans know about aluminum? |language=fr |journal=La Revue scientifique |volume=18 |issue=24 |pages=751–753 |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2151370/f754.image}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} but this has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eggert |first=Gerhard |year=1995 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cDoYAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=roman+aluminum&amp;dq=roman+aluminum|title=Ancient aluminum? Flexible glass? Looking for the real heart of a legend|journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|volume=19|issue=3|pages=37–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the Chinese produced aluminium-containing alloys during the reign of the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|first Jin dynasty]] (265–420).{{efn|Alumina was plentiful and could be reduced by coke in the presence of copper, giving aluminium–copper alloys. The Chinese did not have the technology to produce pure aluminium and the temperatures needed (around 2000 °C) were not achievable.&lt;ref name="Ancient Chinese aluminium"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Butler |first=Anthony R. |last2=Glidewell|first2=Christopher|last3=Pritchard|first3=Sharee E.|date=1986 |title=Aluminium Objects from a Jin Dynasty Tomb – Can They Be Authentic?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1179/isr.1986.11.1.88 |journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=88–94 |doi=10.1179/isr.1986.11.1.88}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggestion was criticized because it is highly unlikely that this method could yield a 85% aluminium alloy. An alternative method has been suggested: an alkali could be decomposed by hot copper to yield metallic potassium or sodium, the formed metal would then displace aluminium from alumina, and the obtained aluminium would dissolve in copper; this suggestion caused equal doubts. Evaluating these claims, British [[sinologist]] and historian [[Joseph Needham]] noted that it remained unclear whether aluminium had been produced in China but warned not to dismiss the possibility of this as the Chinese alchemists of the time were known for their secrecy, and thus the process of obtaining these alloys, if there was one, could be lost with its creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Needham |authorlink=Joseph Needham |title=[[Science and Civilisation in China]].

== Establishing the nature of alum ==

[[File:Antoine lavoisier color.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Portrait of Antoine Lavoisier in a laboratory|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] established that [[alumina]] was an oxide of an unknown metal.]]

At the start of the [[Renaissance]], the nature of alum remained unknown. Around 1530, Swiss physician [[Paracelsus]] recognized alum as separate from ''[[vitriol]]e'' (sulfates) and suggested that it was a salt of an [[Earth (chemistry)|earth]].{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=25}} In 1595, German doctor and chemist [[Andreas Libavius]] demonstrated alum and [[green vitriol|green]] and [[blue vitriol|blue ''vitriole'']] were formed by the same acid but different earths;&lt;ref name="Weeks1968"&gt;{{cite book |last=Weeks |first=Mary Elvira |title=Discovery of the elements |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6kPAQAAMAAJ |year=1968 |volume=1 |edition=7 |publisher=Journal of chemical education |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the undiscovered earth that formed alum, he proposed the name "alumina".{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=25}} In 1702, German chemist [[Georg Ernst Stahl]] stated the unknown base of alum was akin to [[Lime (material)|lime]] or [[chalk]]; this mistaken view was shared by many scientists for half a century.{{sfn|Richards|1896|p=2}} In 1722, German chemist [[Friedrich Hoffmann]] suggested the base of alum was a distinct earth.{{sfn|Richards|1896|p=2}} In 1728, French chemist [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] claimed alum was formed by an unknown earth and [[sulfuric acid]];{{sfn|Richards|1896|p=2}} he mistakenly believed burning of that earth yielded silica.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=26}} In 1739, French chemist [[Jean Gello]] proved the earth in clay and the earth resulting from the reaction of an alkali on alum were identical.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=27}} In 1746, German chemist Johann Heinrich Pott showed the precipitate obtained from pouring an alkali into a solution of alum was different from lime and chalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pott |first=Johann Heinrich |title=Chymische Untersuchungen, welche fürnehmlich von der Lithogeognosia oder Erkäntniß und Bearbeitung der gemeinen einfacheren Steine und Erden ingleichen von Feuer und Licht handeln |trans-title=Chemical investigations which primarily concern lithogeognosia or knowledge and processing of common simple rocks and earths as well as fire and light |language=de |publisher=Voss, Christian Friedrich |year=1746 |volume=1 |p=32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxZAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1754, German chemist [[Andreas Sigismund Marggraf]] synthesized the earth of alum by boiling clay in sulfuric acid and adding [[potash]].{{sfn|Richards|1896|p=2}} He realized that adding soda, potash, or an alkali to a solution of the new earth in sulfuric acid yielded alum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Chisholm |editor-first=Hugh |year=1911 |title=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |edition=11 |entry=Alum |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the earth as alkaline, as he had discovered it dissolved in acids when dried.

In 1760, French chemist Theodor Baron de Henouville suggested alumina was a metallic earth and attempted to reduce it to its metal, but with no success. He claimed he had tried every method of reduction known at the time, though his methods were not published. It is probable that he mixed alum with carbon or some organic substance, with salt or soda for flux, and heated it in a charcoal fire.{{sfn|Richards|1896|p=3}} In 1782, French chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] wrote he considered alumina was an oxide of a metal with an affinity for oxygen so strong that no known reducing agents could overcome it.{{sfn|Richards|1896|pp=3–4}}

In 1790, Austrian chemists Anton Leopold Ruprecht and Matteo Tondi repeated Baron's experiments, significantly increasing the temperatures. They found small metallic particles they believed were the sought-after metal; but later experiments by other chemists showed these were [[iron phosphide]] from impurities in charcoal and bone ash. German chemist [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] commented in an aftermath, "if there exists an earth which has been put in conditions where its metallic nature should be disclosed, if it had such, an earth exposed to experiments suitable for reducing it, tested in the hottest fires by all sorts of methods, on a large as well as on a small scale, that earth is certainly alumina, yet no one has yet perceived its metallization."{{sfn|Richards|1896|p=4}} Lavoisier in 1794&lt;ref name="Guyton" /&gt; and French chemist [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau]] in 1795 melted alumina to a white enamel in a charcoal fire fed by pure oxygen but found no metal.&lt;ref name="Guyton"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guyton |first=Louis-Bernard |authorlink=Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau |title=Expériences comparatives sur les terres, pour déterminer leur fusibilité, leur manière de se comporter avec les flux salins ou vitreux, et l'action dissolvante qu'elles exercent réciproquement les unes sur les autres |trans-title=Comparative experiments on the earth, to determine their fusibility, their behavior with the saline or vitreous flows, and the dissolving action they exert on each other |language=fr |journal=Journal de l'École polytechnique |volume=3 |year=1795 |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k4336621/f113.image |page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; American chemist [[Robert Hare (chemist)|Robert Hare]] in 1802 melted alumina with an [[Oxyhydrogen#Oxyhydrogen blowpipe|oxyhydrogen blowpipe]], also obtaining the enamel, but still found no metal.{{sfn|Richards|1896|p=4}}

In 1807, British chemist [[Humphry Davy]] successfully electrolyzed alumina with alkaline batteries, but the resulting alloy contained [[potassium]] and [[sodium]], and Davy had no means to separate the desired metal from these. He then heated alumina with potassium, forming [[potassium oxide]], but was unable to produce the sought-after metal.{{sfn|Richards|1896|p=4}} In 1808, Davy set up a different experiment on electrolysis of alumina, establishing that alumina decomposed in the electric arc, but formed metal alloyed with iron and he was unable to separate the two.&lt;ref name="Davy1812"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davy|first=Humphry|authorlink=Humphry Davy|title=Elements of Chemical Philosophy: Part 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YjMwAAAAYAAJ|volume=1|year=1812|publisher=Bradford and Inskeep|chapter=Of metals; their primary compositions with other uncompounded bodies, and with each other|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally he tried yet another electrolysis experiment, seeking to collect the metal on iron, but was again unable to separate the coveted metal from it.{{sfn|Richards|1896|p=4}} Davy suggested the metal be named ''alumium'' in 1808&lt;ref name="Davy1808"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Humphry|date=1808|title=Electro Chemical Researches, on the Decomposition of the Earths; with Observations on the Metals obtained from the alkaline Earths, and on the Amalgam procured from Ammonia|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kg9GAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA353|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|publisher=Royal Society of London|volume=98|page=353|doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0023|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''aluminum'' in 1812, thus producing the modern name.&lt;ref name="Davy1812"/&gt; Other scientists used the spelling ''aluminium''; the former spelling regained usage in the United States in the following decades.&lt;ref name="Quinion2005"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Js-PbsEjKSQC&amp;pg=PT23|title=Port Out, Starboard Home: The Fascinating Stories We Tell About the words We Use|last=Quinion|first=Michael|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|year=2005|isbn=978-0-14-190904-2|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1824, Danish physicist and chemist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] attempted the production of the metal.

Berzelius tried to isolate the metal in 1825 by carefully washing the potassium analog of the base salt in [[cryolite]] in a [[crucible]]. Prior to the experiment, he had correctly identified the formula of this salt as K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. He found no metal, but his experiment came very close to succeeding and was successfully reproduced many times later. Berzelius's mistake was in using an excess of potassium, which made the solution too alkaline; the alkaline solution dissolved all the newly formed aluminium.{{sfn|Richards|1896|pp=4–5}}

In 1827, German chemist [[Friedrich Wöhler]] visited Ørsted and received explicit permission to continue the aluminium research, which Ørsted "did not have time" for.&lt;ref name="Christensen20132" /&gt; Wöhler repeated Ørsted's experiments but did not identify any aluminium.

French chemist [[Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville]] announced an industrial method of aluminium production in 1854 at the [[Paris Academy of Sciences]].{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=39}} Aluminium chloride could be reduced by sodium, a metal more convenient and less expensive than potassium used by Wöhler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sainte-Claire Deville  |first=H.

Manufacturers did not wish to devote resources from producing well-known metals, such as [[iron]] and [[bronze]], to experiment with a new one; moreover, produced aluminium was still not of great purity and differed in properties by sample. This led to the initial general reluctance to produce the new metal.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=46}} World's first industrial production of aluminium was established at a smelter in [[Rouen]] in 1856 by Deville and partners.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=39}} Deville's smelter moved that year to La Glacière and then [[Nanterre]], and in 1857 to [[Salindres]]. The smelter was subsequently acquired by the French company [[Pechiney|Pechiney and the Compagnie d'Alais et de la Camargue]],  which later became world's largest in chemical production of aluminium. The factory's technology continued to improve, and the output grew from 2 kilograms in Nanterre to 1,800 kilograms in Salindres in 1872.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=41}} The factory in Salindres used [[bauxite]] as the primary aluminium ore;{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=42}} some chemists, including Deville, sought to use [[cryolite]], but with little success.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=43–45}} British engineer William Gerhard set up a plant with cryolite as the primary raw material in Battersea, London, in 1856, but technical and financial difficulties forced the closure of the plant in three years.{{sfn|McNeil|1990|p=104}}

Other chemists also sought to industrialize production of aluminium. British ironmaster [[Isaac Lowthian Bell]] produced aluminium from 1860 to 1874. During the opening of his factory, he waved to the crowd with a unique and costly aluminium [[top hat]].&lt;ref name="Howell2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Georgina|title=Gertrude Bell: Queen of the Desert, Shaper of Nations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekb4b0Js98EC|date=2010|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-1-4299-3401-5|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; British engineer James Fern Webster launched the industrial production of aluminium by reduction with sodium in 1882; his aluminium was much purer than Deville's. Several other production sites were set up in the 1880s.{{sfn|McNeil|1990|pp=104–106}} World production of aluminium in 1869 equaled 2 [[metric ton]]s; in 1884, it was 4 tons.{{sfn|Skrabec|2017|pp=13–14}} In 1886, American engineer Alexander Castner devised a method of cheaper production of sodium, which decreased the price of aluminium to $8 per pound, but he did not have enough capital to construct a large factory like Deville's. Deville continued to improve his production method and it remained dominant until the late 1890s, when the much cheaper electrolytic production was fully commercialized; Deville was unable to reduce the price from $15 per pound, while electrolytic aluminium cost $0.54 per pound in 1897.{{sfn|Skrabec|2017|p=15}}

== Electrolytic production ==

[[File:HallPatentCover.pdf|thumb|Cover of the patent granted to [[Charles Martin Hall]] for his process of reducing aluminium by electrolysis. Hall filed the patent two months after Héroult filed his; as a result, it took him almost three years to prove the originality of his method and the patent was only granted in 1889.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=59}}|alt=Cover of Hall's patent for electrolytic aluminium production]]

Aluminium was first synthesized electrolytically in 1854 independently by Deville and the German chemist [[Robert Wilhelm Bunsen]]. Their electrolysis methods did not become the basis for industrial production of aluminium because electrical supplies were inefficient at the time; this only changed with the invention of the [[dynamo]] by Belgian engineer [[Zénobe-Théophile Gramme]] in 1870 and the [[three-phase current]] by Russian engineer [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] in 1889.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=52–53}}

The first large-scale production method was independently developed by French engineer [[Paul Héroult]] and American engineer [[Charles Martin Hall]] in 1886; it is now known as the [[Hall–Héroult process]]. Electrolysis of pure alumina is impractical given its very high melting point; both Héroult and Hall realized its melting point could be significantly lowered by presence of molten cryolite. Héroult could not find enough interest in his invention as demand for aluminium was still small and Deville's factory in Salindres did not wish to improve their process. In 1888, Héroult and his companions founded Aluminium Industrie Aktien Gesellschaft and started industrial production of [[aluminium bronze]] in [[Neuhausen am Rheinfall]]. This production was only active for a year, but during that time, Société électrométallurgique française was founded in Paris. The society purchased Héroult's patents and appointed him as the director of a smelter in [[Isère]], which would produce aluminium bronze on a large scale at first and pure aluminium in a few months.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=55–59}}&lt;ref name="h1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D41942.php|title = Alusuisse|language = German|publisher = Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Hall produced aluminium by the same process in his home at [[Oberlin, Ohio|Oberlin]],&lt;ref name="Sheller2014"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOfaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41|title=Aluminum Dreams: The Making of Light Modernity|last=Sheller|first=Mimi|publisher=MIT Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-262-02682-6|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully tested it at the smelter in [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport]]. He then sought to employ it for a large-scale production. For that, the smelter owners would have to radically change their production methods, which they were not willing to do because a mass production of aluminium would immediately drop the price of the metal. The president of the company considered purchasing Hall's patent to ensure that the competitors would not make use of the it. Hall founded the [[Pittsburgh Reduction Company]] in 1888 and initiated the mass production of aluminium. In the coming years, this technology was improved and new factories were constructed.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=59–61}}

The Hall–Héroult process converts alumina into the metal; Austrian chemist [[Carl Josef Bayer|Carl Joseph Bayer]] discovered a way of purifying bauxite to yield alumina in 1889, now known as the [[Bayer process]]. Bayer [[Sintering|sintered]] bauxite with alkali and [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]] it with water; after stirring the solution and introducing a [[seed crystal|seeding agent]] to it, he found a precipitate of pure aluminium hydroxide, which decomposed to alumina on heating. In a few years, he discovered that the aluminium contents of bauxite dissolved in the alkaline leftover from isolation of alumina solids; this was crucial for the industrial employment of this method.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=74}}

Modern production of the aluminium metal is based around the Bayer and Hall–Héroult processes. The Hall–Héroult process was further improved in 1920 by a team led by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Söderberg. Previously, anode cells had been made from pre-baked coal blocks, which quickly corrupted and required replacement; the team introduced continuous electrodes made from a [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] and [[tar]] paste in a reduction chamber. This greatly increased the world output of aluminium.&lt;ref name="aluminiumleader"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://aluminiumleader.com/history/industry_history/ |title=Aluminium history |date= |website=All about aluminium |publisher=[[Rusal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prices for aluminium declined, and by the early 1890s, the metal had become widely used in jewelry, eyeglass frames, optical instruments, and many everyday items. Aluminium tableware began to be produced in the late 19th century and gradually supplanted copper and cast iron tableware in the first decades of the 20th century. [[Aluminium foil]] was popularized at that time. Aluminium is soft and light, but it was soon discovered that alloying it with other metals could increase its hardness while preserving low density. Aluminium alloys found many uses in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For instance, aluminium bronze is applied to make flexible bands, sheets, and wire, and is widely employed in the shipbuilding and aviation industries.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=64–69}} Aviation used a new aluminium alloy, [[duralumin]], invented in 1903.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=66–69}} Aluminium recycling started in the early 20th century and has been used extensively since&lt;ref name="Schlesinger20132"/&gt; as aluminium is not impaired by recycling and thus can be recycled repeatedly.&lt;ref name="Lumley2010"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Lumley |editor-first=Roger |last=Wallace |first=G. |chapter=Production of secondary aluminium |title=Fundamentals of Aluminium Metallurgy: Production, Processing and Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXpwAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70 |year=2010 |publisher=Elsevier Science |isbn=978-0-85709-025-6 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, only the metal that had not been used by end-consumers was recycled.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt; During [[World War I]], major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light strong airframes.

During the first half of the 20th century, the [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real price]] for aluminium continuously fell from $14,000 per metric ton in 1900 to $2,340 in 1948 (in 1998 United States dollars) with some exceptions such as the sharp price rise during World War I.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt; Aluminium was plentiful and in 1919, Germany began to replace its silver coins with aluminium ones; more and more denominations were switched to aluminium coins as [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]] progressed in the country.{{sfn|Skrabec|2017|p=79}} By the mid-20th century, aluminium had become a part of everyday lives, becoming an essential component of houseware.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=69–70}} Aluminium [[freight car]]s first appeared in 1931. Their lower mass allowed them to carry more cargo.&lt;ref name="transport" /&gt; During the 1930s, aluminium emerged as a civil engineering material, being used in both basic construction and building interiors,{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=165–166}} and advanced its use in military engineering for both airplanes and tank engines.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=85}}

Aluminium obtained from recycling was considered inferior to primary aluminium because of poorer chemistry control as well as poor removal of [[dross]] and [[slag]]s. Recycling grew overall but largely depended on the output of primary production: for instance, as electric energy prices went down in the United States in the late 1930s, more primary aluminium could be produced in the energy-expensive Hall–Héroult process, rendering recycling less needed, and thus aluminium recycling rates went down.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger20132"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xF_OBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA154|title=Aluminum Recycling |edition=2 |last=Schlesinger|first=Mark E.|publisher=CRC Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4665-7025-2|pages=2–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1940, mass recycling of post-consumer aluminium had begun.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt;

During [[World War II]], production peaked again, first exceeding 1,000,000 metric tons in 1941.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt; Aluminium was heavily used in aircraft production and thus a strategic material of extreme importance; so much so that when Alcoa (successor of Hall's Pittsburgh Reduction Company and the aluminium production monopolist in the United States at the time) did not expand its production, [[U.S. Secretary of Interior]] proclaimed in 1941, "If America loses the war, it can thank the Aluminum Corporation of America".&lt;ref name="Seldes2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/FactsAndFascism/FactsandFascism_djvu.txt|title=Facts and Fascism|last=Seldes|first=George|publisher=In Fact, Inc.|year=1943|edition=5|page=261|authorlink=George Seldes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Germany was world's leading producer of aluminium; the Germans thus saw aluminium as their edge in the war.

By 1955, the world market had been mostly divided by the Six Majors: Alcoa, [[Alcan]] (originated as a part of Alcoa), [[Reynolds Metals Company|Reynolds]], [[Kaiser Aluminum|Kaiser]], Pechiney (successor of Pechiney and the Compagnie d'Alais et de la Camargue that bought Deville's smelter), and [[Alusuisse]] (successor of Héroult's&amp;nbsp;Aluminium Industrie Aktien Gesellschaft); their combined share of the market equaled 86%. From 1945, aluminium consumption grew by almost 10% each year for nearly three decades, gaining ground in building applications, electric cables, basic foils, and the aircraft industry. In the early 1970s, an additional boost came from the development of aluminium beverage cans.{{sfn|Nappi|2013|pp=5–6}} The real price declined until the early 1970s because extraction and processing costs were lowered over technological progress and increased production of aluminium,{{sfn|Nappi|2013|p=9}} which first exceeded 10,000,000 metric tons in 1971.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/historical-statistics/|title=Historical Statistics for Mineral Commodities in the United States|chapter=Aluminum.

In the late 1960s, governments became aware of waste from the industrial production; they enforced a series of regulations favoring recycling and waste disposal.

In the 1970s, the increased demand for aluminium made it an exchange commodity; it entered the [[London Metal Exchange]], world's oldest industrial metal exchange, in 1978.&lt;ref name="aluminiumleader" /&gt; Since then, aluminium has been traded for United States dollars and its price fluctuated along with the exchange rates of the currency.{{sfn|Nappi|2013|pp=12–13}} The need to exploit lower-grade poorer quality deposits and the use of fast increasing input costs (above all, energy) increased the net cost of aluminium;{{sfn|Nappi|2013|p=9}} the real price began to grow in the 1970s.{{sfn|Nappi|2013|pp=9–10}}

The increase of the real price and changes of tariffs and taxes started redistribution of the world producers' shares: the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan accounted for nearly 60% of world's primary production in 1972 (and their combined share of consumption of primary aluminium was also close to 60%),{{sfn|Nappi|2013|p=7}} but their combined share only slightly exceeded 10% in 2012.{{sfn|Nappi|2013|p=3}} Production moved from the United States, Japan, and Western Europe to Australia, Canada, the Middle East, Russia, and China, where production was cheaper.{{sfn|Nappi|2013|p=10}} Production costs in the late 20th century changed because of advances in technology, lower energy prices, exchange rates of the United States dollar, and alumina prices.{{sfn|Nappi|2013|pp=14–15}} The [[BRIC]] countries' combined share grew in the first decade of the 21st century from 32.6% to 56.5% in primary production and 21.4% to 47.8% in primary consumption.{{sfn|Nappi|2013|p=17}} China is accumulating an especially large share of world production, thanks to abundance of resources, cheap energy, and governmental stimuli;{{sfn|Nappi|2013|p=20}} it also increased its share of consumption from 2% in 1972 to 40% in 2010.{{sfn|Nappi|2013|p=22}} The only other country with a two-digit percentage was the United States with 11%; no other country exceeded 5%.{{sfn|Nappi|2013|p=23}} In the United States, Western Europe, and Japan, most aluminium was consumed in transportation, engineering, construction, and packaging.{{sfn|Nappi|2013|p=23}}

The world output continued to grow: in 2013, annual production of aluminium exceeded 50,000,000 metric tons. In 2015, it was a record 57,500,000 tons.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;

'''[[Epistemology]]''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἐπιστήμη&amp;nbsp;– ''episteme''-, "knowledge, science" and λόγος, "[[logos]]") or '''theory of knowledge''' is the branch of [[philosophy]] concerned with the nature and scope (limitations) of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Volume 3, 1967, Macmillan, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; It addresses the questions "What is knowledge?", "How is knowledge acquired?", "What do people know?", "How do we know what we know?", and "Why do we know what we know?". Much of the debate in this field has focused on [[Philosophical analysis|analyzing]] the nature of knowledge and how it relates to similar notions such as [[truth]], [[belief]], and [[Theory of justification|justification]]. It also deals with the means of production of knowledge, as well as skepticism about different knowledge claims.

The '''International Union for Quaternary Research''' ('''INQUA''') was founded in 1928.  It has members from a number of scientific disciplines who study the [[Natural environment|environmental]] changes that occurred during the [[Ice age|glacial ages]], the last 2.6 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=U.S. National Committee for INQUA|publisher= National Academy of Sciences (United States)|url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/biso/INQUA/PGA_068141|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605164705/http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/biso/INQUA/PGA_068141|archivedate=5 June 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICSU"&gt;{{Cite web|title=INQUA, INternational Union for QUAternary Research|publisher=International Council for Science (ICSU)|url=http://www.icsu.org/publicdb/frmDisplayMember?docid=2ef89cdef4926b61da23e7fd0324a0cc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204204337/http://www.icsu.org/publicdb/frmDisplayMember?docid=2ef89cdef4926b61da23e7fd0324a0cc|archivedate=4 February 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One  goal of these investigators is to document the timing and patterns in past [[Climate change|climatic changes]] to help understand the causes of changing climates.

INQUA is a Scientific Union member of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU).&lt;ref name="ICSU" /&gt; INQUA holds an international congress normally every four years. The congresses serve as an educational forum as well as the opportunity for the various commissions, committees, and working groups to conduct business in person. Past congresses have been held in [[Copenhagen]] (1928), [[Leningrad (disambiguation)|Leningrad]] (1932), [[Vienna]] (1936), [[Rome]] (1953), [[Madrid]] (1957), [[Warsaw]] (1961), [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] (1965), [[Paris]] (1969), [[Christchurch]] (1973), [[Birmingham]] (1977), [[Moscow]] (1982), [[Ottawa]] (1987), [[Beijing]] (1991),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=James, L.

The most recent INQUA Congress (XIX) was held in [[Nagoya]], Japan, in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XIX INQUA 2015 Congress|url=http://inqua2015.jp/|website=XIX INQUA 2015 Nagoya, Japan|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019 the next INQUA Congress (XX) will take place in [[Dublin]], Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INQUA 2019|url=http://www.inqua2019.org/|website=INQUA 2019 Dublin, Ireland|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Climate change==
In 2007, the union issued a statement on [[climate change]] in which they reiterated the conclusions of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), and urged all nations to take prompt action in line with the [[UNFCCC]] principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=INQUA Statement On Climate Change|publisher=INQUA|url=http://www.inqua.tcd.ie/documents/iscc.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910214453/http://www.inqua.tcd.ie/documents/iscc.pdf|archivedate=2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Human activities are now causing atmospheric concentrations of [[greenhouse gases]] - including [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], [[tropospheric ozone]], and [[nitrous oxide]] - to rise well above pre-industrial levels….Increases in greenhouse gasses are causing temperatures to rise…The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action….Minimizing the amount of this carbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere presents a huge challenge but must be a global priority.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Consider a situation where [[atoms]] are being deposited onto a flat [[Substrate (materials science)|surface]] at a very slow rate.  The first atom deposited undergoes a [[random walk]] on the surface.  Eventually a second atom is deposited and can be expected to eventually meet the first atom, given enough time.  Once the two atoms meet they may bond to form a particle with a higher mass and a lower random walk velocity.  Because the bonded particles are now more stable and less mobile than before, they are called an "island".  Subsequent atoms deposited on the substrate eventually meet and bond with the island, further increasing its size and stability.  Eventually the island can grow to fill the entire substrate with a single large grain.

If atoms are being deposited at a faster rate, there will be many atoms present on the substrate before any large stable islands form.  As these atoms meet, they will bond to their local neighbors before having the chance to migrate to a distant island.  In this way a large number of separate islands are formed and can grow independently.  Eventually the separate islands will grow to become separate grains in the final film.

The island growth model is used to explain how fast deposition techniques (such as [[sputter deposition]]) can produce films with many randomly oriented grains, whereas slow deposition techniques (such as [[Molecular beam epitaxy|MBE]]) tend to produce larger grains with more uniform structure.

'''Leopold Joseph Franz Johann Fitzinger''' (13 April 1802 – 20 September 1884) was an [[Austria]]n [[zoologist]].

Fitzinger was born in [[Vienna]] and studied [[botany]] at the [[University of Vienna]] under [[Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin]]. He worked at the Vienna [[Naturhistorisches Museum]] between 1817, when he joined as a volunteer assistant, and 1821, when he left to become secretary to the provincial legislature of [[Lower Austria]]; after a hiatus he was appointed assistant curator in 1844 and remained at the Naturhistorisches Museum until 1861.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/en/research/1_zoology_vertebrates/herpetological_collection/history/the_herpetological_collection ''Naturhistorisches Museum Wien'']&lt;/ref&gt; Later he became director of the zoos of [[Munich]] and [[Budapest]].

In 1826 he published ''Neue Classification der Reptilien'', based partly on the work of his friends [[Friedrich Wilhelm Hemprich]] and [[Heinrich Boie]].  In 1843 he published ''Systema Reptilium'', covering [[gecko]]s, [[chameleon]]s and [[iguana]]s.

Fitzinger is commemorated in the scientific names of five reptiles: ''[[Algyroides fitzingeri]]'', ''[[Leptotyphlops fitzingeri]]'', ''[[Liolaemus|Liolaemus fitzingerii]]'', ''[[Micrurus tener|Micrurus tener fitzingeri]]'', and ''[[Oxyrhopus|oxyrhopus fitzingeri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

'''Mary Mulvihill''' (1 Sep 1959 – 11 June 2015) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] scientist, radio television presenter, author and educator. She founded and served as the first chairperson of [[Women in Technology and Science]] (WITS), and is viewed as a pioneer of [[science communication]] in [[Ireland]]. She was featured in ''Silicon Republic's'' 100 Top Women in STEM list.&lt;ref name="O'Dea"&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Dea|first1=Ann|title=A pioneer in science communications, and a friend, Mary Mulvihill RIP|url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/life/2015/06/12/a-pioneer-in-science-communications-and-a-friend-mary-mulvihill-rip|accessdate=9 August 2015|agency=Silicon Republic|date=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mulvihill studied at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], where she was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin|elected a Scholar]] in 1979, and graduated in 1981 with a degree in genetics. She then went on to complete a master in statistics in 1982 at Trinity. Until 1987, she worked as a Research Officer for An Foras Taluntais (now [[Teagasc]]). She later attended [[Dublin City University]] to study journalism, earning a diploma in 1988.&lt;ref name=Mulcahy /&gt;

==Career==
Mulvihill worked primarily as a self-employed freelancer, as a writer, broadcaster, and developing the online resource of Ingenious Ireland with its accompanying walking tours.&lt;ref name=Mulcahy /&gt; She served on the Irish Council for Bioethics, and as a council member of [[Industrial Heritage Association of Ireland]].&lt;ref name=Ingenious&gt;{{cite web|title=More about Mary|url=http://ingeniousireland.ie/mary-mulvihill/more-about-mary/|website=Ingenious Ireland|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadcasting===
Mulvihill was the creator and host of a number of popular science series for [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] Radio 1 and Lyric FM.&lt;ref name=Kearns&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kearns|first1=David|title=Pioneering science journalist Mary Mulvihill dies aged 55|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/pioneering-science-journalist-mary-mulvihill-dies-aged-55-31297946.html|accessdate=9 August 2015|agency=The Irish Independent|date=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the radio series she developed centred on the collections of the [[National Botanic Gardens (Ireland)|National Botanic Gardens]], ''Washed, Pressed and Dried'' (2007),&lt;ref name=Jebb&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jebb|first1=Matthew|title=Dreaming of sheep-eating plants|journal=Botanic Gardens Conservation International|date=2012|volume=9|issue=1|url=https://www.bgci.org/resources/article/0707/|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[Natural History Museum (Ireland)|Natural History Museum]], ''Chopped, Pickled, and Stuffed'' (2006).

Her work in broadcasting led her to develop a series of walking tours of Dublin, which took in the scientific history.&lt;ref name=Mulcahy&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Colm Mulcahy|Mulcahy]]|first1=Colm|title=Ingenious Mary: Innovative Irish Science Journalist Leaves a Formidable STEM Legacy|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/colm-mulcahy/ingenious-mary_b_7611822.html|accessdate=9 August 2015|agency=The Huffington Post|date=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ó Conghaile|first1=Pól|title=Six Super Dublin Walking Tours by Locals, For Locals|url=http://lovindublin.com/dublin/six-super-dublin-walking-tours-locals-locals|website=Lovin' Dublin|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tours were also available as podcasts.&lt;ref name=Jebb /&gt; One of the trails she developed was ''Dublin by Numbers'', in conjunction with [[Institution of Engineers of Ireland]], which focused on the places in Dublin relating to mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explore Dublin by Numbers!|url=http://www.steps.ie/media/news/archive/explore-dublin-by-numbers!.aspx#|website=Engineers Ireland|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying website maps places of historic interest linked to STEM in Ireland, as well as sites of ecological and archaeological interest.&lt;ref name="O'Dea" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Tom|title=Birr telescope named one of Ireland's seven wonders|url=http://www.offalyindependent.ie/news/roundup/articles/2012/06/01/4010722-birr-telescope-named-one-of-irelands-seven-wonders|website=Offaly Independent|accessdate=9 August 2015|ref=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar set of audio tours were developed by Mulvihill, in collaboration with [[Matthew Jebb]] for the National Botanic Gardens.&lt;ref name=Jebb /&gt;

===Women in Technology and Science===
Mulvihill was an advocate for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), in particular the history and biographies of women involved in STEM.&lt;ref name=Mulcahy /&gt; She founded the group Women in Technology and Science (WITS) in 1990, and served as the organisation's first chairperson.&lt;ref name=Ingenious /&gt; WITS is an advocacy and networking group for women in STEM fields in Ireland. One is the resources WITS provides is a register of Irish women in STEM interested in serving on boards and professional or conference panels.&lt;ref name=Lillington&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lillington|first1=Karlin|title=Farewell Mary Mulvihill, great champion of Irish science|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/farewell-mary-mulvihill-great-champion-of-irish-science-1.2253421|accessdate=9 August 2015|agency=The Irish Times|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, she launched the exhibition ''SeaScience'' and Exploration Zone at the [[Galway City Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SeaScience comes to Galway City Museum|url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/about-us/news-and-events/news-archive/2014/november2014/seascience-comes-to-galway-city-museum.html|website=NUI Galway|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
Mulvihill served as the co-editor of [[Enterprise Ireland]]’s bi-monthly magazine ''Technology Ireland''. She was also a regular contributor to ''[[The Irish Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Kearns /&gt; She wrote a number of books, and edited two volumes of historical biographies of women in STEM for WITS. For her book, ''Ingenious Ireland: A County-by-County Exploration of Irish Mysteries and Marvels.'', she received the Irish National Science and Technology Journalist of the Year 2002-3, which the judges described as "a meticulously researched and hugely impressive book."&lt;ref name=Mulcahy /&gt; With this book she also won the IBM Science Journalist of the Year award.&lt;ref name=Daly&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daly|first1=Susan|title=7 Dublin curiosities that tell of capital’s inventive past|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/7-dublin-curiosities-that-tell-of-capitals-inventive-past-575792-Sep2012/|accessdate=9 August 2015|agency=The Journal|date=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17344">In [[physics]] and [[cosmology]], the '''mathematical universe hypothesis''' ('''MUH'''), also known as the '''ultimate ensemble theory''', is a speculative "[[theory of everything]]" (TOE) proposed by cosmologist [[Max Tegmark]].&lt;ref name="Tegmark1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tegmark |first=Max |date=November 1998 |title=Is "the Theory of Everything" Merely the Ultimate Ensemble Theory? |journal=Annals of Physics |volume=270 |issue=1 |pages=1–51 |doi=10.1006/aphy.1998.5855 |arxiv = gr-qc/9704009 |bibcode = 1998AnPhy.270....1T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Tegmark 2014, "[http://mathematicaluniverse.org Our Mathematical Universe]", Knopf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Tegmark's MUH is: ''Our external physical reality is a mathematical structure''.&lt;ref name="Tegmark2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tegmark |first=Max |date=February 2008 |title=The Mathematical Universe |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=101–150 |doi=10.1007/s10701-007-9186-9 |arxiv=0704.0646|bibcode = 2008FoPh...38..101T }}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, the physical universe is not merely ''described by'' mathematics, but ''is'' mathematics (specifically, a [[mathematical structure]]).  Mathematical existence equals physical existence, and all structures that exist mathematically exist physically as well.  Observers, including humans, are "self-aware substructures (SASs)".  In any mathematical structure complex enough to contain such substructures, they "will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically 'real' world".&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark (1998), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory can be considered a form of [[Pythagoreanism]] or [[Platonism]] in that it proposes the existence of mathematical entities; a form of [[philosophy of mathematics|mathematical monism]] in that it denies that anything exists except mathematical objects; and a formal expression of [[Structuralism (philosophy of science)|ontic structural realism]].

Tegmark claims that the hypothesis has no free parameters and is not observationally ruled out. Thus, he reasons, it is preferred over other theories-of-everything by [[Occam's Razor]].  Tegmark also considers augmenting the MUH with a second assumption, the '''computable universe hypothesis''' ('''CUH'''), which says that the mathematical structure that is our external physical reality is defined by [[computable function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=0704.0646|title= The Mathematical Universe|journal= Foundations of Physics|volume= 38|issue= 2|pages= 101–150|publisher=|last1= Tegmark|first1= Max|year= 2007|doi= 10.1007/s10701-007-9186-9|bibcode= 2008FoPh...38..101T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MUH is related to Tegmark's categorization of four levels of the [[multiverse]].&lt;ref name="Tegmark2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tegmark |first=Max |editor=Barrow, J.D. |editor2=Davies, P.C.W. |editor3=Harper, C.L. |year=2003 |title="Science and Ultimate Reality: From Quantum to Cosmos" honoring John Wheeler's 90th birthday |chapter=Parallel Universes |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |arxiv=astro-ph/0302131|bibcode=2003SciAm.288e..40T |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0503-40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This categorization posits a nested hierarchy of increasing diversity, with worlds corresponding to different sets of [[initial conditions]] (level 1), [[physical constants]] (level 2), quantum branches (level 3), and altogether different equations or mathematical structures (level 4).

==Reception==

[[Andreas Albrecht (cosmologist)|Andreas Albrecht]] of [[Imperial College]] in London, called it a "provocative" solution to one of the central problems facing physics. Although he "wouldn't dare" go so far as to say he believes it, he noted that "it's actually quite difficult to construct a theory where everything we see is all there is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chown |first=Markus |authorlink = Marcus Chown|date=June 1998 |title=Anything goes |journal=[[New Scientist]] |volume=158 |issue=2157 |url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/toe_press.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms and responses==

===Definition of the ensemble===
[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]&lt;ref name="AToE"&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]] (2000) "[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011122 Algorithmic Theories of Everything.]"&lt;/ref&gt; argues that "Although Tegmark suggests that '... all mathematical structures are a priori given equal statistical weight,' there is no way of assigning equal non-vanishing probability to all (infinitely many) mathematical structures." Schmidhuber puts forward a more restricted ensemble which admits only universe representations describable by [[constructive mathematics]], that is, [[computer program]]s. He explicitly includes universe representations describable by non-halting programs whose output bits converge after finite time, although the convergence time itself may not be predictable by a halting program, due to the [[Undecidable problem|undecidability]] of the [[halting problem]].&lt;ref name="AToE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = J. | authorlink = Jürgen Schmidhuber | year = 2002 | title = Hierarchies of generalized Kolmogorov complexities and nonenumerable universal measures computable in the limit | url = http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/kolmogorov.html | journal = International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 587–612 | doi=10.1142/S0129054102001291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Tegmark notes&lt;ref name="Tegmark2008" /&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=formatting error--look at result in list--it doesn't show up, but has a warning|date=January 2017}} (sec. V.E) that the measure over all universes has not yet been constructed for the [[string theory landscape]] either, so this should not be regarded as a "show-stopper".

===Consistency with Gödel's theorem===
{{See also|Consistency|Gödel's completeness theorem}}
It has also been suggested that the MUH is inconsistent with [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]. In a three-way debate between Tegmark and fellow physicists [[Piet Hut]] and Mark Alford,&lt;ref name='HAT'&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hut | first1 = P. | last2 = Alford | first2 = M. | last3 = Tegmark | first3 = M. | year = 2006 | title = On Math, Matter and Mind | journal = Foundations of Physics | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 765–94 |arxiv = physics/0510188 |bibcode = 2006FoPh...36..765H |doi = 10.1007/s10701-006-9048-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; the "secularist" (Alford) states that "the methods allowed by formalists cannot prove all the theorems in a sufficiently powerful system... The idea that math is 'out there' is incompatible with the idea that it consists of formal systems."

Tegmark's response in&lt;ref name="HAT"/&gt; (sec VI.A.1) is to offer a new hypothesis "that only Gödel-complete ([[Decidability (logic)|fully decidable]]) mathematical structures have physical existence. This drastically shrinks the Level IV multiverse, essentially placing an upper limit on complexity, and may have the attractive side effect of explaining the relative simplicity of our universe." Tegmark goes on to note that although conventional theories in physics are Gödel-undecidable, the actual mathematical structure describing our world could still be Gödel-complete, and "could in principle contain observers capable of thinking about Gödel-incomplete mathematics, just as [[Turing machine|finite-state digital computers]] can prove certain theorems about Gödel-incomplete formal systems like [[Peano arithmetic]]." In&lt;ref name="Tegmark2008"/&gt; (sec. VII) he gives a more detailed response, proposing as an alternative to MUH the more restricted "Computable Universe Hypothesis" (CUH) which only includes mathematical structures that are simple enough that Gödel's theorem does not require them to contain any undecidable or uncomputable theorems. Tegmark admits that this approach faces "serious challenges", including (a) it excludes much of the mathematical landscape; (b) the measure on the space of allowed theories may itself be uncomputable; and (c) "virtually all historically successful theories of physics violate the CUH".

===Observability===
Stoeger, Ellis, and Kircher&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Stoeger, [[George F. R. Ellis|G. F. R. Ellis]], U. Kirchner (2006) "[https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0407329 Multiverses and Cosmology: Philosophical Issues.]"&lt;/ref&gt; (sec. 7) note that in a true multiverse theory, "the universes are then completely disjoint and nothing that happens in any one of them is causally linked to what happens in any other one. This lack of any causal connection in such multiverses really places them beyond any scientific support". Ellis&lt;ref&gt;G.F.R. Ellis, "83 years of general relativity and cosmology: Progress and problems", Class. Quantum Grav. 16, A37-A75, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; (p29) specifically criticizes the MUH, stating that an infinite ensemble of completely disconnected universes is "completely untestable, despite hopeful remarks sometimes made, see, e.g., Tegmark (1998)."
Tegmark maintains that MUH is [[testable]], stating that it predicts (a) that "physics research will uncover mathematical regularities in nature", and (b) by assuming that we occupy a typical member of the multiverse of mathematical structures, one could "start testing multiverse predictions by assessing how typical our universe is" (&lt;ref name="Tegmark2008"/&gt; sec. VIII.C).

===Plausibility of radical Platonism===
{{See also|Philosophy of mathematics#Mathematicism}}
The MUH is based on the Radical Platonist view that math is an external reality (&lt;ref name="Tegmark2008"/&gt; sec V.C). However, Jannes&lt;ref name="Jannes2009"&gt;Gil Jannes, "Some comments on 'The Mathematical Universe'", Found. Phys. 39, 397-406, 2009 [https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.0867 arXiv:0904.0867]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that "mathematics is at least in part a human construction", on the basis that if it is an external reality, then it should be found in some other [[animals]] as well: "Tegmark argues that, if we want to give a complete description of reality, then we will need a language independent of us humans, understandable for non-human sentient entities, such as aliens and future supercomputers". [[Brian Greene]] (&lt;ref&gt;B. Greene 2011, "[https://www.amazon.com/The-Hidden-Reality-Parallel-Universes/dp/0307278123 ''[[The Hidden Reality]]'' ]"&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;299) argues similarly: "The deepest description of the universe should not require concepts whose meaning relies on human  experience or interpretation. Reality transcends our existence and so shouldn't, in any fundamental way, depend on ideas of our making."

However, there are many non-human entities, plenty of which are intelligent, and many of which can apprehend, memorise, compare and even approximately add numerical quantities. Several animals have also passed the [[Mirror test|mirror test of self-consciousness]]. But a few surprising examples of mathematical abstraction notwithstanding (for example, chimpanzees can be trained to carry out symbolic addition with digits, or the report of a parrot understanding a “zero-like concept”), all examples of [[animal intelligence]] with respect to mathematics are limited to basic counting abilities. He adds, "non-human intelligent beings should exist that understand the language of advanced mathematics. However, none of the non-human intelligent beings that we know of confirm the status of (advanced) mathematics as an objective language." In the paper "On Math, Matter and Mind"&lt;ref name="HAT"/&gt; the secularist viewpoint examined argues (sec. VI.A) that math is evolving over time, there is "no reason to think it is converging to a definite structure, with fixed questions and established ways to address them", and also that "The Radical Platonist position is just another metaphysical theory like solipsism... In the end the metaphysics just demands that we use a different language for saying what we already knew."  Tegmark responds (sec VI.A.1) that "The notion of a mathematical structure is rigorously defined in any book on [[Model Theory]]", and that non-human mathematics would only differ from our own "because we are uncovering a different part of what is in fact a consistent and unified picture, so math is converging in this sense." In his 2014 book on the MUH,&lt;ref&gt;M. Tegmark 2014, "[http://mathematicaluniverse.org Our Mathematical Universe]"&lt;/ref&gt; Tegmark argues that the resolution is not that we invent the language of mathematics, but that we discover the structure of mathematics.

===Coexistence of all mathematical structures===
[[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]] has argued&lt;ref&gt;D. Page, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0610101 Predictions and Tests of Multiverse Theories.]"&lt;/ref&gt; (sec 4) that "At the ultimate level, there can be only one world and, if mathematical structures are broad enough to include all possible worlds or at least our own, there must be one unique mathematical structure that describes ultimate reality. So I think it is logical nonsense to talk of Level 4 in the sense of the co-existence of all mathematical structures." Tegmark responds (&lt;ref name="Tegmark2008"/&gt; sec. V.E) that "this is less inconsistent with Level IV than it may sound, since many mathematical structures decompose into unrelated substructures, and separate ones can be unified."

===Consistency with our "simple universe"===
[[Alexander Vilenkin]] comments&lt;ref name="Vilenkin2006"&gt;A. Vilenkin (2006) ''Many Worlds in One: The Search for Other Universes''. Hill and Wang, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; (Ch. 19, p.&amp;nbsp;203) that "the number of mathematical structures increases with increasing complexity, suggesting that 'typical' structures should be horrendously large and cumbersome. This seems to be in conflict with the beauty and simplicity of the theories describing our world". He goes on to note (footnote 8, p.&amp;nbsp;222) that Tegmark's solution to this problem, the assigning of lower "weights" to the more complex structures (&lt;ref name="Tegmark2003"/&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=formatting error--look at result in list--it doesn't show up, but has a warning|date=January 2017}} sec. V.B) seems arbitrary ("Who determines the weights?") and may not be logically consistent ("It seems to introduce an additional mathematical structure, but all of them are supposed to be already included in the set").

===Occam's razor===
Tegmark has been criticized as misunderstanding the nature and application of [[Occam's razor]]; [[Massimo Pigliucci]] reminds that "Occam's razor is just a useful [[heuristic]], it should never be used as the final arbiter to decide which theory is to be favored".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/rationally_speaking/mathematical_universe_i_ain%E2%80%99t_convinced-127841|title=Mathematical Universe? I Ain’t Convinced|work=Science 2.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Northrop Grumman X-47B''' is a [[technology demonstration|demonstration]] [[unmanned combat air vehicle]] (UCAV) designed for [[aircraft carrier]]-based operations. Developed by the American defense technology company [[Northrop Grumman]], the X-47 project began as part of [[Defense Advanced Research Project Agency|DARPA]]'s [[Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems|J-UCAS]] program, and subsequently became part of the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstrator program|Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstration]] (UCAS-D) program. The X-47B is a tailless [[jet engine|jet]]-powered [[blended wing body|blended-wing-body]] aircraft capable of semi-autonomous operation and [[aerial refueling]].&lt;ref name=EatFuel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/look-autonomous-drone-eat-fuel-sky|title=Watch this autonomous drone eat fuel|work=[[Popular Science]]|date=17 April 2015|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and development==

===Origins===
[[File:X-47B First to Complete Autonomous Aerial Refueling.webm|thumb|Video of aerial refueling of an X-47B in April 2015]]
The US Navy did not commit to practical UCAS efforts until 2000, when the service awarded contracts of US$2 million each to [[Boeing]] and Northrop Grumman for a 15-month concept-exploration program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=2527 "DARPA And Navy Select Naval UCAV Contractors"]. US Department of Defense. 20 June 2000. Retrieved 30 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Design considerations for a naval UCAV included dealing with the corrosive [[seawater|saltwater]] environment, deck handling for launch and recovery, integration with command and control systems, and operation in an aircraft carrier's high-electromagnetic-interference environment. The Navy was also interested in procuring UCAVs for reconnaissance missions, penetrating protected airspace to identify targets for following attack waves.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]''. "Tailless Tailhooker: Autonomous U.S. Navy X-plane flight marks sea change toward unmanned carrier aviation". 14 February 2011. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Northrop Grumman's proof-of-concept [[X-47A Pegasus]], which provided the basis for the X-47B's development, first flew in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/x47/|title=X-47 Pegasus UCAV|publisher=Airforce-Technology.com|accessdate=13 February 2015}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The J-UCAS program was terminated in February 2006 following the US military's [[Quadrennial Defense Review]]. The US Air Force and Navy proceeded with their own UAV programs. The Navy selected Northrop Grumman's X-47B as its unmanned combat air system demonstrator (UCAS-D) program.&lt;ref name="AW0111"/&gt; To provide realistic testing, the company built the demonstration vehicle to be the same size and weight as the projected operational craft, with a full-sized weapons bay capable of carrying existing missile systems.&lt;ref name=Wired20131302&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/02/x47-weapons/ | title=Navy: No New Weapons System on Our Future Carrier-Based Drone | first=Spencer | last=Ackerman | date=13 February 2013 | work=Wired | accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/18/x47b_rollout_ceremony/ "US Navy's robot stealth carrier plane unveiled"].

The X-47B prototype rolled out from [[Air Force Plant 42]] in [[Palmdale, California]], on 16 December 2008. Its first flight was planned for November 2009, but the flight was delayed as the project fell behind schedule.  On 29 December 2009, Northrop Grumman oversaw towed taxi tests of the aircraft at the Palmdale facility,&lt;ref name="AW0111"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morring |first=Frank |date=11 January 2010|title=Taxi Tests for UCAS-D|journal=Aviation Week|publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aircraft taxiing under its own power for the first time in January 2010.

On 28 August 2013, a contractor-flown [[Learjet 25]] refueled from a [[Boeing 707]] tanker while flying autonomously as a surrogate aircraft uploaded with the X-47B's technology.&lt;ref name=707AutoRe/&gt; The test was to demonstrate that unmanned and optionally manned aircraft can have an automated aerial refueling capability, significantly increasing their range, persistence, and flexibility.&lt;ref name=707AutoRe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-navy-begins-unmanned-refuelling-trials-390454/|title=US Navy begins unmanned refuelling trials|publisher=Flightglobal.com|date= 12 September 2013|accessdate= 15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to further demonstrate autonomous aerial refueling were reportedly cut in the Navy’s fiscal 2014 budget,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/asd_04_15_2013_p03-01-568738.xml |title=X-47B Unmanned Aerial Refueling Demo Victim Of Cuts|work=Aviation Week|date=15 April 2013|accessdate= 15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the X-47B nonetheless conducted a successful autonomous refuelling demonstration in April 2015.&lt;ref name=EatFuel/&gt;

'''Novette''' was a two beam [[neodymium]] [[glass]] ([[phosphate glass]]) testbed [[laser]] built at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in about 15 months throughout 1981 and 1982 and was completed in January 1983. Novette was made using recycled parts from the dismantled [[shiva laser|Shiva]] and [[Argus laser|Argus]] lasers and borrowed parts from the future [[Nova laser]]. Its main intended purpose was to validate the proposed design and expected performance of the then planned Nova laser. In addition to being used for the further study of enhanced laser to target plasma energy coupling utilizing [[optical frequency multiplier|frequency tripled]] light and examining its benefits with respect to [[inertial confinement fusion]], Novette was also used in the world's first laboratory demonstration of an [[x-ray laser]] in 1984.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4399">In [[mathematics]], a [[function (mathematics)|function]] defined on an [[inner product space]] is said to have '''rotational invariance''' if its value does not change when arbitrary [[rotation]]s are applied to its argument. 

==Mathematics==

===Functions===

For example, the function 

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 &lt;/math&gt;

is invariant under rotations of the plane around the origin, because for a rotated set of coordinates through any [[angle]] ''θ''

:&lt;math&gt;x' = x \cos \theta  - y \sin \theta &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y' = x \sin \theta + y \cos \theta &lt;/math&gt;

the function, after some cancellation of terms, takes exactly the same form 

:&lt;math&gt;f(x',y') = {x}^2 + {y}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

The rotation of coordinates can be expressed using [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] form using the [[rotation matrix]],

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \theta &amp; -\sin \theta \\ \sin \theta &amp; \cos \theta \\ \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

or symbolically '''x'''&amp;prime; = '''Rx'''. Symbolically, the rotation invariance of a real-valued function of two real variables is

:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}') = f(\mathbf{Rx}) = f(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt;

In words, the function of the rotated coordinates takes exactly the same form as it did with the initial coordinates, the only difference is the rotated coordinates replace the initial ones. For a [[function of several real variables|real-valued function of three or more real variables]], this expression extends easily using appropriate rotation matrices. 

The concept also extends to a [[vector-valued function]] '''f''' of one or more variables;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}') = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{Rx}) = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt;

In all the above cases, the arguments (here called "coordinates" for concreteness) are rotated, not the function itself.

===Operators===

For a [[function (mathematics)|function]]

:&lt;math&gt;f : X \rightarrow X &lt;/math&gt;

which maps elements from a [[subset]] ''X'' of the [[real line]] ℝ to itself, '''rotational invariance''' may also mean that the function [[commutative operation|commute]]s with rotations of elements in ''X''. This also applies for an [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] that acts on such functions. An example is the two-dimensional [[Laplace operator]] 

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} &lt;/math&gt;

which acts on a function ''f'' to obtain another function ∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''f''. This operator is invariant under rotations.

If ''g'' is the function ''g''(''p'') = ''f''(''R''(''p'')), where ''R'' is any rotation, then (∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''g'')(''p'') = (∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''f'')(''R''(''p'')); that is, rotating a function merely rotates its Laplacian.  &lt;!-- Should add the (classical) physics sense, and Computer Vision sense too --&gt;

==Physics==

In [[physics]], if a system behaves the same regardless of how it is oriented in space, then its [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] is rotationally invariant. According to [[Noether's theorem]], if the [[Action (physics)|action]] (the integral over time of its Lagrangian) of a physical system is invariant under rotation, then [[Conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum is conserved]].

=== Application to quantum mechanics ===

{{Further|Rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|Symmetry in quantum mechanics}}

In [[quantum mechanics]], '''rotational invariance''' is the property that after a [[rotation]] the new system still obeys [[Schrödinger's equation]].  That is

:&lt;math&gt;[R,E-H] = 0&lt;/math&gt; 

for any rotation ''R''. Since the rotation does not depend explicitly on time, it commutes with the energy operator. Thus for rotational invariance we must have [''R'',&amp;nbsp;''H''] = 0.

For [[infinitesimal rotation]]s (in the ''xy''-plane for this example; it may be done likewise for any plane) by an angle ''dθ'' the (infinitesimal) rotation operator is

:&lt;math&gt;R = 1 + J_z d\theta \,,&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\left[1 + J_z d\theta , \frac{d}{dt} \right] = 0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

thus

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}J_z = 0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in other words [[angular momentum]] is conserved.

'''''What if the Moon Didn’t Exist''''' is a collection of speculative articles about different versions of [[Earth]], published in book form in 1993.  They were originally published in [[Astronomy (magazine)|''Astronomy'' magazine]]. The individual scenarios are:

* Solon – Earth without a Moon
* Lunholm – Moon closer to Earth
* Petiel – Earth with less mass
* Urania – Earth’s axis tilted like that of [[Uranus]]
* Granstar – More massive sun
* Antar – Effects if a [[supernova]] exploded near Earth
* Cerberon – Star passing through the solar system
* Diablo – [[Black hole]] passing through the Earth
* Seeing the world via [[infrared]]
* Effects of [[ozone layer]] depletion

: For ''the kennel club designation of thoroughbred canines, see [[Working Group (dogs)]].''

A '''working group''' or '''working party''' is a group of [[expert]]s working together to achieve specified goals. The groups are domain-specific and focus on discussion or activity around a specific subject area.  The term can sometimes refer to an [[interdisciplinary]] collaboration of researchers working on new activities that would be difficult to sustain under traditional funding mechanisms (e.g., federal agencies).

The lifespan of a working group can last anywhere between a few months and several years. Such groups have the tendency to develop a ''quasi-permanent existence'' when the assigned task is accomplished;{{Citation needed|reason=There might be research on this topic, which would not only provide the necessary reference, but might also serve as a helpful resource for visitors.|date=August 2013}} hence the need to disband (or phase out) the working group when it has achieved its goal(s).

A working group’s performance is made up of the individual results of all its individual members. A team’s performance is made up of both individual results and collective results.
In large organisations, working groups are prevalent, and the focus is always on individual goals, performance and accountabilities. Working group members do not take responsibility for results other than their own.
On the other hand, teams require both individual and mutual accountability. There is more information sharing, more group discussions and debates to arrive at a group decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jointeambuilding.com/business-tools-for-success/how-to-tell-the-difference-between-groups-and-teams/|title=How To Tell The Difference Between Groups And Teams - Real Teamwork|author=|date=1 November 2016|website=jointeambuilding.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of common goals for working groups include:

[[File: Rachida-Dati-European-Parliament.jpg |thumb|A parliamentary working group]]

:* creation of an informational document
:* creation of a standard
:* resolution of problems related to a system or network
:* continuous improvement
:* research

Working groups are also referred to as ''task groups'', ''workgroups'', or ''technical advisory groups''.

==Characteristics==
The nature of the working group may depend on the group's ''raison d’être'' – which may be technical, artistic (specifically musical), or administrative in nature.

===Administrative working groups===
These working groups are established by decision makers at higher levels of the organization for the following purposes:
# To elaborate, consolidate, and build on the consensus of the decision makers; and
# To ensure (and improve) coordination among the various segments of the organization. A shared commitment to agreed common aims develops among the parties as they work together to clarify issues, formulate strategies, and develop action plans.

For example, the [[Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs]] is a group of twelve federal agencies within the executive branch of the U.S. government, and is responsible for promoting achievement of positive results for at-risk youth. This working group was formally established by Executive Order 13459, ''Improving the Coordination and Effectiveness of Youth Programs'', on February 7, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/02/20080207-15.html Executive Order 13459: ''Improving the Coordination and Effectiveness of Youth Programs'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quality circles]] are an alternative to the dehumanizing concept of the division of labor, where workers or individuals are treated like robots. Quality circles can help enrich the lives of workers or students and aid in creating harmony and high performance. Typical topics are improving occupational safety and health, improving product design, and improvement in the workplace and manufacturing processes.

===Musical working groups===
Although any [[artisan]] or [[artist]] can benefit from being part of a working group, it is especially of great import for [[session player]]s. Musicians face a variety of challenges that can impede the formation of musical working groups, such as touring and studio recording sessions. Such activities make it that much more difficult to concentrate on the developing the cohesiveness that is required to maintain a working group.

However, working groups have been shown to be rewarding to the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]], as it fosters innovation. By working with the same people frequently, members become familiar with the répertoire of other members, which develops trust and encourages spontaneity.

Some of the more notable musical working groups include:
* [[Abdullah Ibrahim Trio]];
* [[Alex von Schlippenbach Trio]];
* [[Dave Holland]] ''(Trio, Quartet, or Quintet)'';
* [[Die Like A Dog Quartet]];
* [[Gary Bartz Quartet]];
* [[Vandermark 5]]; and
* [[William Parker Quartet]] ''(Trio/Quartet).''

===Technical working groups===

In many technical organizations, for example [[Standards organization]]s, the groups that meet and make decisions are called "working groups". Examples include:

* [[IETF]] working groups (which are subordinate to Areas)
**[[HTTP WG]], original led by [[Dave Raggett]]&lt;ref name="raggettprofile"&gt;{{cite web|last=Raggett|first=Dave|title=Dave Raggett's Bio|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/profile.html|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[IEEE Standards Association|IEEE-SA]] working groups
**IEEE WG[[IEEE 802.3|802.3]], Ethernet Working Group
**IEEE WG[[IEEE 802.11|802.11]], Wireless LAN Working Group
* [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] working groups (which are subordinate to an SC (subcommittee), subordinate to a TC (technical committee)
* [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use|International Conference on Harmonisation]]
* [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) 
* [[International Astronomical Union]]
* [[W3C]] working groups
**[[W3C Device Description Working Group|Device Description Working Group]]
**[[Technical Architecture Group]]
**[[SVG Working Group]]
*[[Bioethics Council]]
*[[Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems]]

In some cases, like the [[Printer Working Group]], an entire consortium uses the term "working group" for itself.

The rules for who can be a part of the working groups, and how a working group makes decisions, varies considerably between organizations.

==Problem solving==
{{See also|Creativity techniques}}
In [[problem-solving]] contexts, the random-word creativity technique is perhaps the simplest method. A person confronted with a problem is presented with a randomly generated word, in the hopes of a solution arising from any associations between the word and the problem. A random image, sound, or article can be used instead of a random word as a kind of creativity goad or [[wikt:provocation|provocation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ideaflow.corante.com/archives/2003/05/09/more_on_idea_generation_tools_and_techniques.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mitsloan.mit.edu/vc/Ideationpaper022805.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Tools and methodologies to support creativity.

*[[TRIZ]] (theory which are derived from tools such as ARIZ or TRIZ contradiction matrix)
*[[Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument|Method Herrmann]] - right brain / left brain
* [[Brainstorming]] and [[6-3-5 Brainwriting|Brainwriting]]
* [[Six Thinking Hats]], of Edward de Bono
* [[Think outside the box]]
* [[Business war games]], for the resolution of competitive problems
* [[SWOT analysis]]
* [[Thought experiment]]

==Mechanics==
It is imperative for the participants to appreciate and understand that the working group is intended to be a forum for cooperation and participation. Participants represent the interests and views of stakeholders from disparate sectors of the community which happen to have a vested interest in the results of the WG. Therefore, maintaining and strengthening communication lines with all parties involved is essential (this responsibility cuts both ways — [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] are expected to share what information, knowledge and expertise they have on the issue).

Programmes developed should be evaluated by encouraging community input and support; this will ensure that such programmes meet the community's vision for its future. The WG should also regularly seek community feedback on their projects. Apropos questions to be asked during such meetings include:
* What were the objectives of the program?
* What were the results of the project?
* What effect did the results have on the identified problem?
* What unexpected results — desirable or otherwise — were observed?
* How were the results achieved? (Was it by the methods and techniques originally intended, or did these evolve with implementation?)
* Was there an effective use of community resources?
* Should our objective or methods be changed?

Depending on the lifespan of the WG, involved parties (at the very least) convene annually. However, such meetings may happen as often as once every semester or trimester.

The managers are constantly called upon to make decisions in order to solve problems. Decision making and problem solving are ongoing processes of evaluating situations or problems, considering alternatives, making choices, and following them up with the necessary actions &lt;ref&gt;The Decision‐Making Process by John Wiley &amp; Sons.[http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study_guide/The-DecisionMaking-Process.topicArticleId-8944,articleId-8863.html].&lt;/ref&gt; and now with this managed to reach a [[continuous improvement]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1142">In physics, a '''world tube''' is the path of an object which occupies a nonzero region of space (nonzero [[volume]]) at every moment in time, as it travels through 4-[[dimension]]al [[spacetime]]. That is, as it propagates in [[spacetime]], a world tube traces out a three-dimensional [[volume]] for every moment in time.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Ludvigsen: ''General relativity: a geometric approach'', Cambridge University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-521-63019-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hQdh3SVgZ8MC&amp;pg=PA74 p. 74]&lt;/ref&gt; The world tube is analogous to the one-dimensional [[world line]] in that it describes the time evolution of an object in space, with the difference that a world line represents the path of a [[point particle]] (of nonzero volume), whereas a world tube occupies finite space at all moments in time.

The concept of world tube is particularly relevant for [[special relativity]], where a world tube is embedded in [[Minkowski space]].

{{About|the camera lens|the American record label|Zoom Lens (record label)}}
[[Image:Nikkor 28-200 zoom.jpg|thumb|[[Nikkor]] 28-200 mm zoom lens, extended to 200 mm at left and collapsed to 28 mm focal length at right]]

A '''zoom lens''' is a mechanical assembly of [[lens (optics)|lens elements]] for which the [[focal length]] (and thus [[angle of view]]) can be varied, as opposed to a fixed focal length (FFL) lens (see [[prime lens]]).

A true zoom lens, also called a [[parfocal lens]], is one that maintains focus when its focal length changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogercavanagh.com/helpinfo/30_parfocal.stm |title=Parfrocal Lenses |accessdate=2007-11-18 |last=Cavanagh |first=Roger |date=2003-05-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071007070643/http://www.rogercavanagh.com/helpinfo/30_parfocal.stm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A lens that loses focus during zooming is more properly called a [[varifocal lens]]. Despite being marketed as zoom lenses, virtually all consumer lenses with variable focal lengths use varifocal design.

The convenience of variable focal length comes at the cost of complexity - and some compromises on image quality, weight, dimensions, aperture, autofocus performance, and cost. For example, all zoom lenses suffer from at least slight, if not considerable, loss of image resolution at their maximum aperture, especially at the extremes of their focal length range. This effect is evident in the corners of the image, when displayed in a large format or high resolution. The greater the range of focal length a zoom lens offers, the more exaggerated these compromises must become.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Tamron-18-270mm-f-3.5-6.3-Di-II-VC-Lens-Review.aspx |title=Tamron 18-270mm f/3.5-6.3 Di II VC LD Lens Review |accessdate=March 20, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116012337/http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Tamron-18-270mm-f-3.5-6.3-Di-II-VC-Lens-Review.aspx |archivedate=January 16, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Zoom effect.jpg|thumb|A photograph taken with a zoom lens, whose focal length was varied during the course of the exposure]]
Zoom lenses are often described by the ratio of their longest to shortest focal lengths. For example, a zoom lens with focal lengths ranging from 100&amp;nbsp;mm to 400&amp;nbsp;mm may be described as a 4:1 or "4×" zoom. The term [[superzoom]] or hyperzoom is used to describe photographic zoom lenses with very large focal length factors, typically more than 5× and ranging up to 19× in [[SLR camera]] lenses and 83× in amateur [[digital camera]]s. This ratio can be as high as 300× in professional television cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letsgodigital.org/en/news/articles/story_1325.html|title=Panavision debuts the 300x Digital Zoom lens  - LetsGoDigital|first=|last=LetsGoDigital|date=|website=www.letsgodigital.org|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905182242/http://www.letsgodigital.org/en/news/articles/story_1325.html|archivedate=5 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, photographic zoom lenses beyond about 3× cannot generally produce imaging quality on par with [[prime lens]]es. Constant fast aperture zooms (usually {{f/}}2.8 or {{f/}}2.0) are typically restricted to this zoom range. Quality degradation is less perceptible when recording moving images at low resolution, which is why professional video and TV lenses are able to feature high zoom ratios. Digital photography can also accommodate algorithms that compensate for optical flaws, both within in-camera processors and post-production software.

Some photographic zoom lenses are [[long-focus lens]]es, with focal lengths longer than a [[normal lens]], some are [[wide-angle lens]]es (wider than ''normal''), and others cover a range from wide-angle to long-focus. Lenses in the latter group of zoom lenses, sometimes referred to as "normal" zooms{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, have displaced the fixed focal length lens as the popular one-lens selection on many contemporary cameras. The markings on these lenses usually say '''W''' and '''T''' for "Wide" and "Telephoto". Telephoto is designated because the longer focal length supplied by the negative diverging lens is longer than the overall lens assembly (the negative diverging lens acting as the "telephoto group").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbdefSMHICkC&amp;pg=PA521&amp;dq=zoom+lens+negative+become+telephoto&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2EAKToW7CaTg0QHPpdmeAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=zoom+lens+negative+become+telephoto&amp;f=false|title=Business and Corporate Aviation Management : On Demand Air Travel: On Demand Air Travel|first=John|last=Sheehan|date=12 June 2003|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|accessdate=1 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some digital cameras allow cropping and enlarging of a captured image, in order to emulate the effect of a longer focal length zoom lens (narrower angle of view). This is commonly known as [[digital zoom]] and produces an image of lower [[optical resolution]] than optical zoom. Exactly the same effect can be obtained by using [[digital image processing]] software on a computer to crop the digital image and enlarge the cropped area. Many digital cameras have both, combining them by first using the optical, then the digital zoom.

Zoom and superzoom lenses are commonly used with [[still camera|still]], [[video camera|video]], [[motion picture camera|motion picture]] [[camera]]s, [[Image projector|projectors]], some [[binoculars]], [[microscope]]s, [[telescope]]s, [[telescopic sight]]s, and other [[optical instrument]]s. In addition, the [[Afocal system|afocal]] part of a zoom lens can be used as a [[optical telescope|telescope]] of variable [[magnification]] to make an adjustable [[beam expander]]. This can be used, for example, to change the size of a [[laser]] beam so that the [[irradiance]] of the beam can be varied.

==History==
[[Image:Zoomar MG 1895a.jpg|thumb|The Voigtländer Zoomar, 36–82&amp;nbsp;mm {{f/}}2.8]]
Early forms of zoom lenses were used in [[optical telescope]]s to provide continuous variation of the [[magnification]] of the image, and this was first reported in the proceedings of the [[Royal Society]] in 1834. Early [[patent]]s for [[telephoto lens]]es also included movable lens elements which could be adjusted to change the overall focal length of the lens. Lenses of this kind are now called '''[[#Varifocal lens|varifocal lenses]]''', since when the focal length is changed, the position of the focal plane also moves, requiring refocusing of the lens after each change.

The first true ''zoom'' lens, which retained near-sharp focus while the effective focal length of the lens assembly was changed, was patented in 1902 by [[Clile C. Allen]] ({{US patent|696788}}).  An early use of the zoom lens in cinema can be seen in the opening shot of the movie "It" starring Clara Bow, from 1927.  The first industrial production was the [[Bell and Howell]] [[Cooke Optics|Cooke]] "Varo" 40–120&amp;nbsp;mm lens for 35mm movie cameras introduced in 1932. The most impressive early TV Zoom lens was the VAROTAL III,  from [[Taylor Hobson|Rank Taylor Hobson]] from UK built in 1953. The [[Kilfitt]] 36–82&amp;nbsp;mm/2.8 [[Zoomar]] introduced in 1959 was the first varifocal lens in regular production for still [[35mm film|35mm]] photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/03/15/110085221.html?pageNumber=419|title=Zoom Lens for Stills|last=Deschin|first=Jacob|date=15 March 1959|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 12, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern film zoom lens, the Pan-Cinor, was designed around 1950 by [[Roger Cuvillier]], a French engineer working for [[SOM-Berthiot]]. It had an optical compensation zoom system. In 1956, [[Pierre Angénieux]] introduced the mechanical compensation system, enabling precise focus while zooming, in his 17-68mm lens for 16mm released in 1958. The same year a prototype of the 35mm version of the Angénieux 4x zoom, the 35-140mm was first used by cinematographer Roger Fellous for the production of Julie La Rousse. Angénieux received a 1964 technical award from the academy of motion pictures for the design of the 10 to 1 zoom lenses, including the 12-120mm for 16mm film cameras and the 25-250mm for 35mm film cameras.

Since then advances in optical design, particularly the use of [[computer]]s for optical [[ray tracing (physics)|ray tracing]], has made the design and construction of zoom lenses much easier, and they are now used widely in professional and amateur photography.

==Design==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
[[Image:Zoomlens1.svg|frame|right|A simple zoom lens system. The three lenses of the afocal system are ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (from left). ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can move to the left and right, changing the overall focal length of the system (see image below).]]
There are many possible designs for zoom lenses, the most complex ones having upwards of thirty individual lens elements and multiple moving parts. Most, however, follow the same basic design. Generally they consist of a number of individual lenses that may be either fixed or slide axially along the body of the lens. While the magnification of a zoom lens changes, it is necessary to compensate for any movement of the focal plane to keep the focused image sharp. This compensation may be done by mechanical means (moving the complete lens assembly while the magnification of the lens changes) or optically (arranging the position of the focal plane to vary as little as possible while the lens is zoomed).

A simple scheme for a zoom lens divides the assembly into two parts: a focusing lens similar to a standard, fixed-focal-length photographic lens, preceded by an ''[[Afocal system|afocal]] zoom system'', an arrangement of fixed and movable lens elements that does not focus the light, but alters the size of a beam of light travelling through it, and thus the overall magnification of the lens system.

[[Image:Zoomlens2.svg|frame|left|Movement of lenses in an [[Afocal system|afocal]] zoom system]]
In this simple optically compensated zoom lens, the afocal system consists of two positive (converging) lenses of equal focal length (lenses ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with a negative (diverging) lens (''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) between them, with an absolute focal length less than half that of the positive lenses. Lens ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is fixed, but lenses ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be moved axially in a particular non-linear relationship. This movement is usually performed by a complex arrangement of gears and cams in the lens housing, although some modern zoom lenses use computer-controlled [[Servomechanism|servo]]s to perform this positioning.

While the negative lens ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; moves from the front to the back of the lens, the lens ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; moves forward and then backward in a parabolic arc. In doing so, the overall angular magnification of the system varies, changing the effective focal length of the complete zoom lens. At each of the three points shown, the three-lens system is afocal (neither diverging or converging the light), and hence does not alter the position of the focal plane of the lens. Between these points, the system is not exactly afocal, but the variation in focal plane position can be small enough (about ±0.01&amp;nbsp;mm in a well-designed lens) not to make a significant change to the sharpness of the image.

[[Image:Zoom prinzip.gif|frame|right|Simplified zoom lens in operation]]
An important issue in zoom lens design is the correction of optical aberrations (such as [[chromatic aberration]] and, in particular, [[field curvature]]) across the whole operating range of the lens; this is considerably harder in a zoom lens than a fixed lens, which needs only to correct the aberrations for one focal length. This problem was a major reason for the slow uptake of zoom lenses, with early designs being considerably inferior to contemporary fixed lenses and usable only with a narrow range of [[f-number]]s. Modern optical design techniques have enabled the construction of zoom lenses with good aberration correction over widely variable focal lengths and apertures.

Whereas lenses used in cinematography and video applications are required to maintain focus while the focal length is changed, there is no such requirement for still photography and for zoom lenses used as projection lenses.  Since it is harder to construct a lens that does not change focus with the same image quality as one that does, the latter applications often use lenses that require refocusing once the focal length has changed (and thus strictly speaking are [[varifocal lens]]es, not zoom lenses). As most modern still cameras are [[autofocus]]ing, this is not a problem.

Designers of zoom lenses with large zoom ratios often trade one or more aberrations for higher image sharpness. For example, a greater degree of barrel and pincushion [[distortion (optics)|distortion]] is tolerated in lenses that span the focal length range from wide angle to telephoto with a focal ratio of 10× or more than would be acceptable in a fixed focal length lens or a zoom lens with a lower ratio. Although modern design methods have been continually reducing this problem, barrel distortion of greater than one percent is common in these large-ratio lenses. Another price paid is that at the extreme telephoto setting of the lens the effective focal length changes significantly while the lens is focused on closer objects. The apparent focal length can more than halve while the lens is focused from infinity to medium close-up. To a lesser degree, this effect is also seen in fixed focal length lenses that move internal lens elements, rather than the entire lens, to effect changes in magnification.

==Varifocal lens==
Many so-called "zoom" lenses, particularly in the case of fixed-lens cameras, are actually ''[[varifocal lens]]es'', which gives lens designers more flexibility in optical design trade-offs (focal length range, maximal aperture, size, weight, cost) than true parfocal zoom, and which is practical because of autofocus, and because the camera processor can move the lens to compensate for the change in the position of the focal plane while changing magnification ("zooming"), making operation essentially the same as a true parfocal zoom.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
