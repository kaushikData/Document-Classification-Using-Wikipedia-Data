[[A Coruña|La Coruña]]; 16 February  1983) is a Spanish [[publicist]].

== Early life ==

At the age of 4, her family moved to Madrid and Silva studied at the Saint Louis And Mater Salvatoris school.&lt;ref name="Mater Salvatoris2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matersalvatoris.org/|title=Mater Salvatoris|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 15, Silva moved to Dorset, UK, for schooling and she concluded her [[A levels]] education. Thereafter she returned to [[Madrid]] to study at the university and she graduated with a degree in advertising and marketing. Following graduation, Silva worked as an intern in [[The Farm (company)|The Farm]] ad agency in [[Madrid]], and in 2005 she accepted a position in sales and marketing at a private firm in the airplane industry.

== Personal life ==

She is the daughter of Ignacio Silva and Paola Garcia-Baquero. Her father is a businessman and the former Vice President of [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid Football Club]].

In 2012, Alejandra Silva married [[Govind Friedland]] and gave birth to Albert in December 2012.

In 2011, the couple acquired the former summer home of the Italian film director [[Franco Zeffirelli]]  in [[Positano]], [[Italy]], and established a luxury boutique hotel and named it [[Hotel Villa Treville]]. Alejandra Silva and Govind Friedland divorced at the end of December 2015. Silva met [[Richard Gere]] before she divorced Friedland while working at the Treville Hotel, a hotel she was managing at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/loc/2015/10/10/5617d46c46163f62148b4595.html|title=Alejandra Silva, el complicado divorcio de la novia española de Richard Gere|last=Gonzalez|first=Sergio|date=10 October 2015|work=El Mundo|language=Spanish|access-date=25 May 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charity / Activism ==

Silva has a long history of being active in social responsibility organizations.

In 2007, Silva promoted a non-profit initiative jointly with [[Karolina Kurkova]] called Beautiful Life Fund. This non-profit organization raised awareness of the plight of children in need, distressed refugee children, victims of war, and the education of homeless children around the world.

In 2010 she participated in the Real Madrid Football Club Foundation African Initiative Project&lt;ref name="Proyecto de Iniciativa Africana en África Occidental 4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realmadrid.com/en/about-real-madrid/foundation|title=Fundación Real Madrid|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by creating soccer leagues as means of integrating underprivileged children to their local communities and promoting sports and its values amongst African families.

Through her interest in non-profit organizations, Silva met American actor [[Richard Gere]]. Their relationship gained notoriety in the press in June 2015. As of 2016, Silva continues her activism in non-profit organization and supports The Rais Foundation&lt;ref name="Rise Foundation 3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://raisfundacion.org/es/informate/noticias_y_eventos/richard-gere-y-alejandra-silva-visitan-rais-fundaci-n|title=Fundación Rais|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fus.hola.com%2Factualidad%2F2015111982190%2Falejandra-silva-habla-planes-futuro%2F&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url|title=Alejandra Silva y Richard Gere, unidos por su faceta solidaria|last=|first=|date=19 November 2015|website=Hola.com|publisher=|language=Spanish|access-date=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the Homeless.

{{Japanese name|Asano}}
{{nihongo|'''Asano Sōichirō'''|浅野 総一郎||extra=April 13, 1848 &amp;ndash; November 9, 1930}} was a [[Japan]]ese businessman responsible for founding a number of companies, including what became today's [[JFE Group]].
[[File:Asano souichiro.jpg|thumb|right|]]

He came from a [[samurai]] family in the [[Toyama region]]. He was Doctor Asano Taijun's son. He was originally named Asano Taijiro. He purchased [[Fukagawa Cement Works]] from the government in 1884, with help from [[Shibusawa Eiichi]], and diversified his business interests, which eventually became a minor [[zaibatsu]] (kept minor because it did not include a [[bank]]). Asano is called "the cement king of the [[Meiji period]]."

Asano also established the forerunner of the JR [[Tsurumi Line]], located between Tokyo and Yokohama. [[Asano Station]] is named after him.

{{Wills, trusts, estates}}
An '''asset-protection trust''' is any form of trust which provides for funds to be held on a [[discretionary trust|discretionary basis]]. Such trusts are set up in an attempt to avoid or mitigate the effects of [[taxation]], [[divorce]] and [[bankruptcy]] on the beneficiary. Such trusts are therefore frequently proscribed or limited in their effects by governments and the courts.

The asset-protection trust is a trust that splits the beneficial enjoyment of trust assets from their legal ownership. The beneficiaries of a trust are the beneficial owners of equitable interests in the trust assets, but they do not hold legal title to the assets. Thus this kind of trust fulfills the goal of [[asset protection]] planning, i.e. to insulate assets from claims of creditors without concealment or [[tax evasion]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} A creditor's ability to satisfy a judgment against a beneficiary's interest in a trust is limited to the beneficiary's interest in such trust. Consequently, the common goal of asset protection trusts is to limit the interests of beneficiaries in such a way so as to preclude creditors from collecting against trust assets.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Such trusts must be irrevocable (a revocable trust will not provide asset protection because and to the extent of the settlor's power to revoke). Most of them contain a spendthrift clause preventing a trust beneficiary from alienating his or her expected interest in favor of a creditor. The spendthrift clause has three general exceptions to the protection afforded: the self-settled trusts (if the settlor of a trust is also a beneficiary of a trust), the case when a debtor is the sole beneficiary and the sole trustee of a trust, and the support payments (a court may order the trustee to satisfy a beneficiary's support obligation to a former spouse or minor child). The first general exception, which accounts for the majority of asset protection trusts, no longer applies in several jurisdictions. The laws of certain jurisdictions including Alaska, Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands allow self-settled trusts to afford their settlors the protection of the spendthrift clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1163&amp;context=alr|first=Jeremy M.|last=Veit|title=Self-Settled Spendthrift Trusts and the Alaska Trust Act: Has Alaska Moved Offshore?|journal=Alaska Law Review|volume=16|issue=2|page=269}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of trusts==
{{main|Trust law}}

Trusts were developed at common law in England originally to minimize the impact of inheritance taxes arising from transfers at death.  The essence of the trust was to separate "legal" title, which was given to someone to hold as "trustee", from "equitable title", which was to be retained by the trust beneficiaries.

In the United States and England, a practice developed whereby trust [[settlor]]s began to use "[[Spendthrift trust|spendthrift]]" clauses to prevent trust beneficiaries from alienating their beneficial interests to creditors.  Over time, courts were asked to determine the efficacy of spendthrift clauses as against the trust beneficiaries seeking to engage in such assignments, and the creditors of those beneficiaries seeking to reach trust assets. A case law doctrine developed whereby courts may generally recognize the efficacy of spendthrift clauses as against trust beneficiaries and their creditors, but not against creditors of a settlor.

==Domestic asset protection trust==

Alaska was the first US jurisdiction to enact laws allowing protection for self-settled trusts (in 1997) and was shortly followed by Delaware, Nevada, South Dakota and a few others. These trusts are known as ''Domestic Asset Protection Trusts'' (DAPTs). Usually, a DAPT must comply with the following requirements:
* the trust must be irrevocable and spendthrift;
* at least one resident trustee must be appointed;
* some administration of the trust must be conducted in respective state;
* the settlor cannot act as a trustee.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Trusts are generally governed by the laws of the jurisdiction that is designated by the settlor as the governing jurisdiction. There are two exceptions to the general rule, which may create conflicts of law: (i) states will not recognize laws of sister states that violate their own public policy, and (ii) if the trust owns real property, such property will be governed by the law of jurisdiction that is the property's situs. Additionally, the [[Full Faith and Credit clause]] of the Constitution provides that each state must give full faith and credit to the laws of every other state. This means that if a court from another state refuses to recognize the protection of a DAPT and enters a judgment for the creditor, the creditor may be able to enforce the judgment against the trustee of the DAPT, even if that trustee was located in the DAPT jurisdiction. The efficacy of a DAPT may also be challenged under the Supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, under the applicable [[fraudulent conveyance|fraudulent transfer]] statute, or because the settlor retained some prohibited control over the trust.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

These jurisdictions are also known as ''United States Asset Protection Trusts'' (USAPTs), from the point of view of the non-US settlors. The issues that would seem to apply on a USAPT established by a non-US settlor are: 1) whether a non-US court has jurisdiction over the USAPT; 2) the conflict of US versus non-US laws (i.e., which jurisdiction's laws will apply to the trust and the protection it purports to offer); 3) which fraudulent transfer law would apply; and 4) whether the US state court will recognize the non-US judgment.&lt;ref name="USAPT"&gt;{{cite web|title=The United States As An Offshore Asset Protection Trust Jurisdiction – The World’s Best Kept Secret |author=Alexander A. Bove, Jr. |publisher=Trusts &amp; Trustees, Vol. 14 Issue 1 (Oxford Journals, 2008) |url=http://www.bovelanga.com/publications/articles/US%20as%20Offshore%20Asset%20Protection%20Jurisdiction.pdf |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708085701/http://www.bovelanga.com/publications/articles/US%20as%20Offshore%20Asset%20Protection%20Jurisdiction.pdf |archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The context of a non-US settlor has a few advantages over that of a US settlor. The issue of the Full Faith and Credit clause doctrine of the US Constitution would not apply to a non-US settlor facing a non-US judgment. Creditors of non-US settlors would have to first obtain a judgment in their home jurisdiction and then attempt to enforce that "foreign" judgment in the US against the trustee of the USAPT, who was not a party to the original action. Therefore, except in unusual cases, this would mean that the only issues to litigate would be whether a fraudulent transfer has taken place, and in turn, which jurisdiction's fraudulent transfer laws would apply. Despite that, the non-US creditor must still seek to first have the foreign judgment recognized, because without formal legal acknowledgment of the judgment in the US court, there would be no basis on which to question the transfer.&lt;ref name="USAPT"/&gt;

==U.S. jurisdictions==

===South Dakota===

South Dakota was one of the first states (1983) to allow a trust to endure perpetually, essentially jumping outside the onerous federal transfer (gift, estate and generation-skipping) tax system theoretically forever. Currently, twenty-four other states have joined the ranks of offering a long-term trust. Nineteen of these states, including South Dakota, allow a trust to continue in perpetuity.

South Dakota does not impose any form of state taxation on the assets that comprise a trust located there. This includes, but is not limited to: no state income, capital gains, dividend/interest and/or intangible's taxes. Additionally, South Dakota has the lowest insurance premium tax of any state (i.e., 8 basis points or 8/100ths of 1%) and also offers other very favorable insurance legislation. South Dakota also has both excellent self-settled trust as well as third party discretionary trust statutes, both allowing for domestic asset protection planning with trusts.

South Dakota is the first and only state in the US with a third party discretionary trust statute for asset protection, which states that a discretionary interest in third party trust, limited power of appointments, and remainder interests are not considered property interests. This statute is extremely important to properly asset protect trusts set up to benefit one's family. South Dakota also has some of the top-rated Asset Protection statutes for LLCs and LPs based upon a powerful "sole remedy charging order statute". Consequently, most of the unique and creative trust strategies for the wealthy involve trust administration in South Dakota without the necessity of having the trust's family reside there.

==Offshore jurisdictions==

The trust laws of the offshore world are typically founded on the trust laws of the onshore world. For those jurisdictions which are currently possessions of the UK, or were former possessions of the UK, typically the UK Trustee Act of 1925 is the common starting point. From there, each jurisdiction has sought to develop and evolve the law in a race to develop the most attractive trust environment which maintains acceptable standards, preserves the concepts of a trust, yet is attractive to potential users. Many of these jurisdictions share similar characteristics.

===Bahamas===

The Commonwealth of the Bahamas have traditionally been associated with offshore planning.  However, the Bahamas are probably more noteworthy for offshore banking.  The Bahamas do not recognize self-settled spendthrift trusts, unlike the Cook Islands, Nevis, or Belize.

The burden of proof for a claimant to challenge a transfer into a Bahamian Trust has a limitation period of two years, the same as Cook Islands.

The quality of the banking and investment services is reasonable for the uses of a Trustee of an asset protection trust, however, the quality of the judiciary is considered low, as the legal profession is generally closed to the entry of non-Bahamians, and it is therefore difficult bring the knowledge of a specialised trust lawyer to the jurisdiction when needed.

===Belize===

[[Belize]], offers immediate protection from court action initiated by creditors which challenges the settlor's transfer of property into the trust.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} However, due to the paucity of credible offshore banks in Belize, many trusts established in Belize hold assets with a second trustee or third-party financial institution in another country.

===Cayman Islands===

[[Cayman Islands]] trusts are governed principally by the Cayman Islands Trusts Law (2009 Revision), however elements of the Fraudulent Dispositions Law 1989 are relevant when considering the asset protection benefits of Cayman Trusts.

A number of offshore jurisdictions have enacted modern asset protection legislation based on the Cayman Island's Fraudulent Dispositions Law 1989 (the "FDL").&lt;ref&gt;Cayman Islands Fraudulent Dispositions Law 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The Cayman Islands FDL states "Every disposition of property made with an intention to defraud, and at undervalue, shall be voidable at the insistence of an eligible creditor thereby prejudiced".&lt;ref&gt;STEP Diploma in International Trust Management Course Notes Module 11&lt;/ref&gt; The burden of proof is borne by the creditor applying to set aside the trust, and in the case of the Cayman Islands, the creditor/claimant must bring an action in the Cayman Islands courts (not in their home jurisdiction). The bar is set high for a potential claimant to successfully challenge a transfer. They must demonstrate an intention to defraud on behalf of the Settlor, and they must demonstrate they are an "eligible creditor" - meaning that at the date of the transfer, the transferor owes an obligation to the claimant. They must also be willing to bring an action in the Cayman Islands, which by itself is an expensive proposition.

The burden of proof for a claimant to challenge a transfer into a Cayman Trust has a limitation period of six years.

In Cayman it is possible to register a trust as an Exempt Trust &lt;ref&gt;Cayman Trusts Law (2009 Revision - Part VI - Section 74(1))&lt;/ref&gt; however it is voluntary registration regime only, so most trusts remain unregistered. As most Cayman trusts are therefore private arrangements, it is hard to give exact figures for the popularity of AP Trusts governed by Cayman law. However the number of licensed trust companies give us some indication of how the jurisdiction is viewed. As of 30 September 2012 the Fiduciary Services Division of CIMA, the body responsible for licensing and regulating trust companies in the Cayman Islands has supervisory responsibility for 146 active trust licences.&lt;ref&gt;CIMA website: http://www.cimoney.com.ky/Stats_Reg_Ent/stats_reg_ent.aspx?id=298&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Cayman Islands are a British Overseas Dependent Territory, the quality of the judiciary is considered excellent, with the islands able to draw on the services of UK lawyers and solicitors when contentious cases arise and expert lawyers with appropriate experience are required. The quality of banking and investment services are reasonably good.

===Cook Islands===

The Cook Islands claims to be the first country to have enacted an explicit asset protection law, implementing particular provisions in 1989 to its International Trusts Act.&lt;ref name="Howard Rosen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of Offshore Jurisdictions: Cook Islands|url=http://protectyou.com/1996/01/review-of-offshore-jurisdictions-part-1/|publisher=The Asset Protection News|author=Howard Rosen|author2=Patricia Donlevy-Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these changes have been adopted in one form or another in several other countries and a handful of a U.S. states.  The most important of these changes permits the settlor of a trust to be named as a spendthrift beneficiary.

The trust laws of the Cook Islands provide a shortened statute of limitations on fraudulent transfer claims.  While most U.S. states have a four-year statute of limitations (and the Statute of Elizabeth in some common law jurisdictions has no statute of limitations), the general statute of limitations in the Cook Islands is reduced to two years for fraudulent transfers; in certain circumstances, it may be as short as one year.  If the trust is funded while the settlor is solvent, then the transfer cannot be challenged.(i.e., there is no time period for the creditor to challenge the transfer)&lt;ref name="Howard Rosen"/&gt;

Several provisions of the Cook Islands law specify the form of pleading that a creditor must establish in order for its claim to be heard in a Cook Islands court.  The effect of these provisions is to raise the burden of proof to "beyond a reasonable doubt," something akin to a criminal law standard, in order for a creditor to establish a fraudulent transfer.  The "constructive" fraudulent transfer theories are eliminated under Cook Islands law, requiring the creditor to prove that the transfer was made with specific intent to avoid the creditor's claim.

It is believed that the Cook Islands now has more registered asset protection trusts than any other country, although it should be noted that in most jurisdictions a Trust is considered a private arrangement and it is not a requirement to register a Trust.  Case law is somewhat lacking in the Cook Islands. However, some landmark decisions show that the Cook Islands Court intends to uphold the asset protection trust law.  In 1999, the Federal Trade Commission attempted to recover assets from a Cook Islands Trust.&lt;ref name="protectyou.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Titling Assets: Pitfalls to be Avoided - Part I|url=http://protectyou.com/2007/06/titling-assets-pitfalls-to-avoid/|author=Howard Rosen|author2=Patricia Donlevy-Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The suit filed by the FTC against a trust company was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="protectyou.com"/&gt; The quality of the judiciary and the associated banking and investment services offered from the Cook Islands are considered poor.

===Nevis===

Nevis was one of the first countries to follow the Cook Islands, duplicating an older version of the Cook Islands law and naming it the Nevis International Exempt Trust Ordinance, 1994.  One distinguishing feature of the Nevis legislation is that a creditor must post a bond of ECB 25,000 (roughly USD 13,000) to lodge a complaint against a trust registered in Nevis.

Very little case law exists in Nevis, which many attorneys interpret to mean that creditors are effectively deterred from bringing suit in Nevis.  It has a small offshore banking industry, with St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla Bank and Bank of Nevis International as the only licensed offshore banks.

LLC legislation modeled after the Delaware LLC Act was passed in 1996.  This has enabled Nevis to distinguish itself as a primary offshore jurisdiction for LLC formations, as opposed to other countries that are well known for IBC formations (British Virgin Islands) or trust formations (Cayman Islands).  A Nevis LLC is often used in conjunction with an asset protection trust because it gives the creator of the trust direct control over the assets if the creator is listed as the manager of the Nevis LLC.  This gives the creator added security in that it keeps the assets one step removed from the trustee of the asset protection trust.  Because the managers and members of a Nevis LLC are not public information, the creator of the trust is able to assume control over the assets without disclosing his control on any public records.

===Channel Islands (Guernsey and Jersey)===

The Channel Islands have been long regarded as being the first jurisdictions to develop an offshore finance industry, each is often regarded as being one of the best quality jurisdictions to use.  Fully compliant with anti money laundering laws,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bedellgroup.com/siteFiles/resources/docs/insights/Briefings/Money%20Laundering%20-%20Jersey%20Briefings/TheAnti-MoneyLaunderingRegime-AJerseyOverview.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208054208/https://www.bedellgroup.com/siteFiles/resources/docs/insights/Briefings/Money%20Laundering%20-%20Jersey%20Briefings/TheAnti-MoneyLaunderingRegime-AJerseyOverview.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-12-08 |title=The Anti-Money Laundering Regime: A Jersey Overview |publisher=Bedell Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; sharing taxation information with an increasing number of countries, modern case law indicate that creditors, who have a rightful claim, are able to freeze trust assets in the Channel Islands.  Tax law initiatives in the UK have largely eliminated the tax advantages of UK citizens placing assets in trust in the Channel Islands, which in the early years had been a source of business.  While the Channel Islands enjoys a modern banking sector, most attorneys do not regard the Channel Islands as appropriate for asset protection planning.

The judicial systems of the Channel Islands are split into two distinct Bailiwicks. The [[Bailiwick of Jersey]], and the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]] (which includes the islands of Guernsey, Alderney Sark, and Herm). The legal systems in each island follows a dual system based on Norman-French codified law overlaid with elements of English common law. Whilst specialised training is required in order to practice law in each of the Bailiwicks, the Bar is not open to everyone, the quality of the judiciary is generally considered very good, if not very expensive. Regulation of Fiduciary companies and the related banking and investment services offered in the Channel Islands is also considered good to excellent.

===Switzerland and Liechtenstein===

Switzerland and Liechtenstein are noteworthy for large banking sectors and sophisticated wealth management services.  While both countries now recognize trusts (particularly trusts established under the laws of another jurisdiction, such as Nevis), there is no available case law yet which indicates how the courts of those two countries will enforce offshore asset protection trust laws.

Many attorneys establish asset protection trusts under the laws of another country and deposit the trust assets in Switzerland or Liechtenstein.  One question raised by this approach is whether a creditor can seize assets in Switzerland or Liechtenstein without having to bring a claim in the trust-protective jurisdiction.  Again, a lack of precedent suggests that this is an open issue in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

Both countries are also known for offering asset protection annuities, with a six-month statute of limitations on fraudulent transfers into an annuity.  Unfortunately for most Americans, these annuities cannot invest in US securities without punitive taxation due to the offshore status of the insurance carriers that offer these annuity products.  Furthermore, many lawyers peddling these annuity products to their clients collect commissions from the insurance carriers.  These reasons, among others, may help explain why annuities offered in these two countries are not particularly popular with U.S. persons.  This does not mean that taxpayers of other jurisdictions may not significantly benefit from holding a Swiss or Liechtenstein annuity.&lt;ref&gt;A reference to: How [http://www.swissannuity.ch Asset protection with Swiss/Liechtenstein annuity works]&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, U.S. persons may benefit from holding an annuity issued by a carrier in an asset-protective jurisdiction (such as the Cook Islands), particularly if the carrier is an electing 953(d) carrier (a reference to a provision of US tax law).&lt;ref&gt;See Section 953(d) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==

Whether such a trust is a [[spendthrift trust]] on the U.S. model, a [[protective trust]] on the Commonwealth model or another form of discretionary trust, it is more likely to be subject to challenge under the [[common law]] doctrine of sham or under specific statutory provisions if any person setting up the trust (or their spouse and their spouse in turn as in a [[reciprocal trust]]):
*can benefit under its provisions;
*is the person under risk financially;
*benefits (whether permitted or not) from the trust; or
*if the person setting up the trust is at risk financially, if bankruptcy or divorce occurs soon after the establishment of the trust ([[fraudulent conveyance]]).

[[Offshore trust]]s and other asset protection vehicles typically do not prevent action against the individual concerned in his or her home country. Orders under divorce and creditor protection laws can typically be made against that individual notwithstanding the alleged independence of such trustees. If a judge determines that the trust settlor controls the assets of the offshore trust, the judge may order the settlor to repatriate the trust assets.  Failure to comply with the court's order may lead to a finding of contempt of court and imprisonment.  For this reason, a properly established asset protection trust should provide a clear separation between the settlor and those who exercise control over the trust assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Importance of Proper APT Design &amp; Counsel|url=http://www.protectyou.com/newsletters/apn7-2.htm|publisher=The Asset Protection News|author=Howard Rosen|author2=Patricia Donlevy-Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== US v. Grant ===
The most recent case to rule on the merits of a contempt order is ''US v. Grant''.  In 2005, a federal district court in Miami ordered a domestic protector of an offshore asset protection trust, under threat of contempt, to exercise her power to replace the foreign trustee with a domestic trustee chosen by the court. The ruling, ''U.S. v. Grant'' Case No. 00-08986-Civ-Jordan (D.C. So. Fla. 2005), threatened to draw into question the viability of an asset-protection trust if a domestic protector could be compelled to appoint a domestic trustee to marshal the assets and bring them within the purview of the domestic court proceedings.

In May 2008, the U.S. government sought to hold the domestic protector in contempt of court for failing to secure the cooperation of the foreign trustee to resign and repatriate the trust assets. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida ruled against the government, finding that the domestic protector could not be held in contempt for failure to gain the cooperation of the offshore trustee. In denying the government's contempt motion, the judge observed:

"I understand that it has been more than two years since the repatriation order was issued and that the funds had not yet been repatriated. But this failure is not for a lack of effort. I am reluctant to fault Mrs. Grant for her trustees' denial of her requests to repatriate the funds." ''U.S. v. Grant'', 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51332, 101 A.F. T.R.2d (RIA) 2676 (D.C. So. Fla. 2008).

For years, lawyers have vigorously debated the vulnerability of an asset protection trust with a domestic protector. The Grant case stands for the proposition that no vulnerability exists if the domestic protector complies with the court's orders. While a domestic protector may be required to make an effort to repatriate trust assets, failure to achieve repatriation should not entail any dire consequences to the trust or to the domestic protector. As long as a duress clause permits the foreign trustee to ignore the pleas of a domestic protector acting under threat of a contempt order, the selection of a domestic protector should not jeopardize the integrity of the offshore asset protection trust.

While most attorneys draft trust agreements to limit the domestic protector's powers to those of a negative nature (i.e., the domestic protector may veto trustee decisions, but a domestic protector cannot order a trustee to do anything), the ruling in ''Grant'' implies that even positive powers exercisable by a domestic protector may not jeopardize an offshore asset protection trust containing a duress clause. Whether this leads attorneys to be more cavalier in their trust drafting remains to be seen. At least we know that traditional offshore asset protection trust planning works as anticipated.

== Taxation ==

There are rigorous US tax reporting requirements that apply to taxpayers who establish offshore trusts.  While no additional tax is usually imposed, certain forms of asset protection trusts require full disclosure of all trust assets and activities on the U.S. contributor's tax returns.  Confidentiality is usually not enjoyed under these arrangements.

Most asset protection trusts established by U.S. settlors are considered "grantor trusts" under U.S. income tax law, meaning that all income of the trust is reportable on the grantor's (i.e., the settlor's) individual income tax return.  Asset-protection trusts do not, in and of themselves, offer any tax advantages under U.S. income tax law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2892">The '''Association of Authorised Public Accountants''' ('''AAPA''') is a British professional body for public accountants.

The AAPA was formed in 1978 as a professional body for auditors recognised individually under the Companies Act 1948. AAPA achieved formal recognition by the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] in 1989 when the Companies Act received [[Royal Assent]]. In September 1991, AAPA achieved the status of a ''Recognised Supervisory Body'' and eligible AAPA members have since been entitled to use the designation ''Registered Auditor''. 

AAPA is not an examining body: all of its members have been admitted either because they have individual audit authorisation or because they have obtained a qualification from another body which is recognised for audit purposes in the UK.

At an Extraordinary General Meeting on 24 June 1996, members of AAPA voted for the body to become a subsidiary company of the '''[[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]]''' ('''ACCA'''). AAPA is, therefore, a company limited by guarantee and registered in [[England]]. While maintaining its own separate and distinctive identity constitutionally, AAPA now benefits from a wide range of authorisation and support facilities through the ACCA.

==Application for membership==
Membership is available to those who are in public practice (as principals or employees) in the following categories:

* those who can demonstrate that they obtained individual authorisation to undertake the audit of limited companies under Sections 389(1)(b) or 389(2) of the Companies Act 1985 [as these sections provided prior to their repeal by Companies Act 1989] immediately before 1 January 1990 and the commencement of Section 25 Part II of Companies Act 1989 (or the Northern Ireland equivalent)
* those who hold the recognised professional qualification awarded by the [[Association of International Accountants]] '''(AIA)'''after June 1991 under the terms of Section 31 of the Companies Act 1989 and who have fulfilled the requisite experience requirements.

(Members in good standing of ACCA and of the Institutes of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland, who are eligible to hold practising certificates, also have the right to apply for membership of AAPA under the terms of its bye-laws.)

{{As of|2008}} the admission fee is £175. The annual subscription becomes payable from 1 January following the date of admission.

The '''balance of payments''', also known as '''balance of international payments''' and abbreviated '''B.O.P.''' or '''BoP''', of a country is the record of all economic transactions between the residents of the country and the rest of world in a particular period of time (over a quarter of a year or more commonly over a year). The balance of payments is a summary of all monetary transactions between a country and rest of the world. These transactions are made by individuals, firms and government bodies. Thus the balance of payments includes all external visible and non-visible transactions of a country. It is an important issue to be studied, especially in international financial management field, for a few reasons.

First, the balance of payments provides detailed information concerning the demand and supply of a country's currency. For example, if [[Sudan]] imports more than it exports, then this means that the quantity supplied of Sudanese pounds by the domestic market is likely to exceed the quantity demanded in the foreign exchanging market, ''[[ceteris paribus]]''. One can thus infer that the [[Sudanese pound]] would be under pressure to depreciate against other currencies. On the other hand, if Sudan exports more than it imports, then the Sudanese pound would be likely to appreciate.

Second, a country's balance of payments data may signal its potential as a business partner for the rest of the world. If a country is grappling with a major balance of payments difficulty, it may not be able to expand imports from the outside world. Instead, the country may be tempted to impose measures to restrict imports and discourage capital outflows in order to improve the balance of payments situation. On the other hand, a country with a significant balance-of payment surplus would be more likely to expand imports, offering marketing opportunities for foreign enterprises, and less likely to impose foreign exchange restrictions.

Third, balance of payments data can be used to evaluate the performance of the country in international economic competition. Suppose a country is experiencing trade deficits year after year. This trade data may then signal that the country's domestic industries lack international competitiveness. 

To interpret balance of payments data properly, it is necessary to understand how the balance of payments account is constructed.&lt;ref name = "International Financial Management"&gt;{{Cite book

  | publisher=Penguin }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These transactions include payments for the country's [[exports]] and [[imports]] of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]], [[Service (economics)|services]], [[financial capital]], and [[Transfer payments|financial transfers]].  It is prepared in a single currency, typically the domestic currency for the country concerned. Balance of Payment account keeps the systematic records of all the economic transactions (visible and non-visible) both of a country with all other countries in the given or specific periods. In BoP account, all the receipts from abroad are recorded as credit and all the payments to abroad are debit. Since, the account is maintained by double entry book keeping system, it shows the balance of payment account is always balanced. Sources of funds for a nation, such as exports or the receipts of [[loans]] and [[investments]], are recorded as positive or surplus items.  Uses of funds, such as for imports or to invest in foreign countries, are recorded as negative or deficit items.

When all components of the BoP accounts are included they must sum to zero with no overall surplus or deficit.  For example, if a country is importing more than it exports, its trade balance will be in deficit, but the shortfall will have to be counterbalanced in other ways – such as by funds earned from its foreign investments, by running down currency reserves or by receiving loans from other countries.

While the overall BoP accounts will always balance when all types of payments are included, imbalances are possible on individual elements of the BoP, such as the [[current account]], the [[capital account]] excluding the central bank's reserve account, or the sum of the two.  Imbalances in the latter sum can result in surplus countries accumulating wealth, while deficit nations become increasingly indebted.  The term "balance of payments" often refers to this sum: a country's balance of payments is said to be in surplus (equivalently, the balance of payments is positive) by a specific amount if sources of funds (such as export goods sold and bonds sold) exceed uses of funds (such as paying for imported goods and paying for foreign bonds purchased) by that amount. There is said to be a balance of payments deficit (the balance of payments is said to be negative) if the former are less than the latter. A BoP surplus (or deficit) is accompanied by an accumulation (or decumulation) of [[foreign exchange reserves]] by the [[central bank]].

Under a [[fixed exchange rate]] system, the central bank accommodates those flows by buying up any net inflow of funds into the country or by providing foreign currency funds to the [[foreign exchange market]] to match any international outflow of funds, thus preventing the funds flows from affecting the [[exchange rate]] between the country's currency and other currencies. Then the net change per year in the central bank's foreign exchange reserves is sometimes called the balance of payments surplus or deficit. Alternatives to a fixed exchange rate system include a [[Managed float regime|managed float]] where some changes of exchange rates are allowed, or at the other extreme a purely [[floating exchange rate]] (also known as a purely ''flexible'' exchange rate). With a pure float the central bank does not intervene at all to protect or devalue its [[currency]], allowing the rate to be set by the [[Market (economics)|market]], and the [[Foreign-exchange reserves|central bank's foreign exchange reserves]] do not change, and the balance of payments is always zero.

==Components==

The [[current account]] shows the net amount of a country's income if it is in surplus, or spending if it is in deficit. It is the sum of the [[balance of trade]] (net earnings on exports minus payments for imports), [[factor income]] (earnings on foreign investments minus payments made to foreign investors)  and cash transfers. It is called the ''current'' account as it covers transactions in the "here and now" – those that don't give rise to future claims.&lt;ref name = "Copeland"&gt;

The  [[capital account]] records the net change in ownership of foreign assets. It includes the [[Capital account#Central Bank operations and the reserve account|reserve account]] (the foreign exchange market operations of a nation's [[central bank]]), along with loans and investments between the country and the rest of world (but not the future interest payments and dividends that the loans and investments yield; those are earnings and will be recorded in the current account).  If a country purchases more foreign assets for cash than the assets it sells for cash to other countries, the capital account is said to be negative or in deficit.

The term "capital account" is also used in the narrower sense that excludes central bank foreign exchange market operations: Sometimes the reserve account is classified as "below the line" and so not reported as part of the capital account.&lt;ref name = "IFM"&gt;{{Cite book

Expressed with the broader meaning for the ''capital account'', the BoP [[Accounting identity|identity]] states that any current account surplus will be balanced by a capital account deficit of equal size – or alternatively a current account deficit will be balanced by a corresponding capital account surplus:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{current account} + \text{ broadly defined capital account}  +  \text{balancing item} = 0. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The ''balancing item'', which may be positive or negative, is simply an amount that accounts for any statistical errors and assures that the current and capital accounts sum to zero.  By the principles of [[double entry accounting]], an entry in the current account gives rise to an entry in the capital account, and in aggregate the two accounts automatically balance. A balance isn't always reflected in reported figures for the current and capital accounts, which might, for example, report a surplus for both accounts, but when this happens it always means something has been missed – most commonly, the operations of the country's central bank – and what has been missed is recorded in the statistical discrepancy term (the balancing item).&lt;ref name = "IFM"/&gt;

An actual balance sheet will typically have numerous sub headings under the principal divisions. For example, entries under '''Current account''' might include:
* ''Trade'' – buying and selling of goods and services
**  ''Exports'' – a credit entry
** ''Imports'' – a debit entry
*** ''Trade balance'' – the sum of Exports and Imports
* ''Factor income'' – repayments and dividends from loans and investments
** ''Factor earnings'' – a credit entry
** ''Factor payments'' – a debit entry
*** ''Factor income balance'' – the sum of earnings and payments.

Especially in older balance sheets, a common division was between visible and invisible entries.  Visible trade recorded imports and exports of physical goods (entries for trade in physical goods excluding services is now often called the ''merchandise balance''). Invisible trade would record international buying and selling of services, and sometimes would be grouped with transfer and factor income as invisible earnings.&lt;ref name = "Sloman"/&gt;

The term "balance of payments surplus" (or deficit – a deficit is simply a negative surplus) refers to the sum of the surpluses in the current account and the narrowly defined capital account (excluding changes in central bank reserves). Denoting the balance of payments surplus as BoP surplus, the relevant identity is

: &lt;math&gt; BOP\ surplus = \text{current account surplus}  +  \text{narrowly defined capital account surplus}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Variations in the use of term "balance of payments"==

Economics writer [[James Orlin Grabbe|J. Orlin Grabbe]] warns the term ''balance of payments'' can be a source of misunderstanding due to divergent expectations about what the term denotes. Grabbe says the term is sometimes misused by people who aren't aware of the accepted meaning, not only in general conversation but in financial publications and the economic literature.&lt;ref name="IFM"/&gt;

A common source of confusion arises from whether or not the ''reserve account'' entry, part of the ''capital account'', is included in the BoP accounts. The reserve account records the activity of the nation's central bank. If it is excluded, the BoP can be in surplus  (which implies the central bank is building up foreign exchange reserves) or in deficit (which implies the central bank is running down its reserves or borrowing from abroad).&lt;ref name = "Sloman"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "IFM"/&gt;

The term "balance of payments" is sometimes misused by non-economists to mean just relatively narrow parts of the BoP such as the [[trade deficit]],&lt;ref name = "IFM"/&gt;  which means excluding parts of the current account and the entire capital account.

Another cause of confusion is the different naming conventions in use.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1973 there was no standard way to break down the BoP sheet, with the separation into invisible and visible payments sometimes being the principal divisions. The IMF have their own standards for BoP accounting which is equivalent to the standard definition but uses different nomenclature, in particular with respect to the meaning given to the term ''capital account''.

===The IMF definition of Balance of Payment===

The [[International Monetary Fund]] (I.M.F.) use a particular set of definitions for the BoP accounts, which is also used by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and the [[United Nations System of National Accounts]] (SNA).&lt;ref name="BOP_Overview"&gt;[[IMF Balance of Payments Manual]], Chapter 2 "Overview of the Framework", Paragraph 2.15 [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2007/bopman6.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference in the IMF's terminology is that it uses the term "financial account" to capture transactions that would under alternative definitions be recorded in the ''capital account''.  The IMF uses the term ''capital account'' to designate a subset of transactions that, according to other usage, previously formed a small part of the overall current account.&lt;ref&gt;The IMF Capital account records mainly capital transfers,  the amounts involved are usually very small compared to other BoP transactions, except in rare cases where a country is the beneficiary of substantial debt forgiveness.&lt;/ref&gt;  The IMF separates these transactions out to form an additional top level division of the BoP accounts. Expressed with the IMF definition,  the BoP identity can be written:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{current account} \, +  \, \text{financial account}\,  + \,  \text{capital account} \, + \, \text{balancing item} \, = \, 0. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The IMF uses the term ''current account'' with the same meaning as that used by other organizations, although it has its own names for its three leading sub-divisions, which are:
* The ''goods and services account''   (the overall trade balance)
* The ''primary income account''   (factor income such as from loans and investments)
* The ''secondary income account'' (transfer payments)
balance of payments are also known as "balance of international trade"

==Imbalances==
While the BoP has to balance overall,surpluses or deficits on its individual elements can lead to imbalances between countries. In general there is concern over deficits in the current account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wdi.umich.edu/files/publications/workingpapers/wp827.pdf |title=The Determinants &amp; Excessiveness of Current Account Deficits in Eastern Europe &amp; the Former Soviet Union, |publisher=Aleksander Aristovnik, William Davidson Institute at the University of Michigan |date=19 July 2006 |accessdate=2010-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720092223/http://wdi.umich.edu/files/publications/workingpapers/wp827.pdf |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Countries with deficits in their current accounts will build up increasing debt or see increased foreign ownership of their assets. The types of deficits that typically raise concern are&lt;ref name = "Sloman"/&gt;
* A ''visible trade deficit'' where a nation is importing more physical goods than it exports (even if this is balanced by the other components of the current account.)
* An overall ''current account deficit''.
* A ''basic deficit'' which is the current account plus foreign direct investment (but excluding other elements of the capital account like short terms loans and the reserve account.)

As discussed in the history section below, the ''Washington Consensus'' period saw a swing of opinion towards the view that there is no need to worry about imbalances. Opinion swung back in the opposite direction in the wake of ''financial crisis of 2007–2009''. Mainstream opinion expressed by the leading financial press and economists, international bodies like the IMF – as well as leaders of surplus and deficit countries – has returned to the view that large current account imbalances do matter.&lt;ref&gt;Though there is difference of opinion on how to resolve the issue with the major surplus countries apart from Japan resisting pressure to lower their own surpluses.&lt;/ref&gt; Some economists do, however, remain relatively unconcerned about imbalances&lt;ref name = "unclear"&gt;{{Cite web

Current account surpluses are facing current account deficits of other countries, the indebtedness of which towards abroad therefore increases. According to [[Balances Mechanics]] by [[Wolfgang Stützel]] this is described as surplus of expenses over the revenues. Increasing imbalances in foreign trade are critically discussed as a possible cause of the financial crisis since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Münchau, "Kernschmelze im Finanzsystem", [[Carl Hanser Verlag]], München, 2008, p. 155ff.; vgl.

===Causes of BoP imbalances===
There are conflicting views as to the primary cause of BoP imbalances, with much attention on the US which currently has by far the biggest deficit. The conventional view is that current account factors are the primary cause&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
An alternative view, argued at length in a 2005 paper by [[Ben Bernanke]], is that the primary driver is the capital account, where a [[Global saving glut|global savings glut]] caused by savers in surplus countries, runs ahead of the available investment opportunities, and is pushed into the US resulting in excess consumption and asset price inflation.&lt;ref&gt;

===Reserve asset===
{{Main| Reserve currency}}
[[File:Hundred dollar bill 03.jpg|thumb|The US dollar has been the leading reserve asset since the end of the gold standard.]]
In the context of BoP and international monetary systems,  the reserve asset is the currency or other store of value that is primarily used by nations for their foreign reserves.&lt;ref&gt;However individual states may choose to keep some of their reserves in the form of whatever currency is used by nations they buy most of their imports from (providing mechanisms are available to settle trades in that currency, which isn't always the case).&lt;/ref&gt;  BoP imbalances tend to manifest as hoards of the reserve asset being amassed by surplus countries,  with deficit countries building debts denominated in the reserve asset or at least depleting their supply. Under a gold standard, the reserve asset for all members of the standard is gold.  In the Bretton Woods system, either gold or the [[U.S. dollar]] could serve as the reserve asset, though its smooth operation depended on countries apart from the US choosing to keep most of their holdings in dollars.

Following the ending of Bretton Woods,  there has been no ''[[de jure]]'' reserve asset,  but the US dollar has remained by far the principal ''[[de facto]]'' reserve. Global reserves rose sharply in the first decade of the 21st century, partly as a result of the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]], where several nations ran out of foreign currency needed for essential imports and thus had to accept deals on unfavourable terms.  The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) estimates that between 2000 and mid-2009, official reserves rose from $1,900bn to $6,800bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
Global reserves had peaked at about $7,500bn in mid-2008, then declined by about $430bn as countries without their own reserve currency used them to shield themselves from the worst effects of the  [[financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial crisis]]. From Feb 2009 global reserves began increasing again to reach close to $9,200bn by the end of 2010.&lt;ref name = "new age"&gt;{{Cite web

{{As of|2009}}, approximately 65% of the world's $6,800bn total is held in U.S. dollars and approximately 25% in [[euro]]s. The  [[UK pound]], [[Japanese yen]], IMF [[special drawing rights]] (SDRs), and precious metals&lt;ref&gt;Mainly gold, but also silver, platinum and palladium.&lt;/ref&gt; also play a role.
In 2009, [[Zhou Xiaochuan]], governor of the [[People's Bank of China]], proposed a gradual move towards increased use of SDRs, and also for the national currencies backing SDRs to be expanded to include the currencies of all major economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

While the current central role of the dollar does give the US some advantages, such as lower cost of borrowings, it also contributes to the pressure causing the U.S. to run a current account deficit, due to the [[Triffin dilemma]]. In a November 2009 article published in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' magazine, economist [[C.

Since 2009 there has been a notable increase in the number of new bilateral agreements which enable international trades to be transacted using a currency that isn't a traditional reserve asset, such as the renminbi, as the [[Settlement currency]].

===Balance of payments crisis===
{{Main| Currency crisis}}
A BoP crisis, also called a ''currency crisis'',  occurs when a nation is unable to pay for essential imports or service its external debt repayments. Typically, this is accompanied by a rapid decline in the value of the affected nation's currency. Crises are generally preceded by large capital inflows,  which are associated at first with rapid economic growth.&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt; However a point is reached where overseas investors become concerned about the level of debt their inbound capital is generating, and decide to pull out their funds.&lt;ref&gt;It sometimes takes only one or two big investors pulling out to trigger a mass panic due to herd effects.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting outbound capital flows are associated with a rapid drop in the value of the affected nation's currency.  This causes issues for firms of the affected nation who have received the inbound investments and loans,  as the revenue of those firms is typically mostly derived domestically but their debts are often denominated in a reserve currency.  Once the nation's government has exhausted its foreign reserves trying to support the value of the domestic currency, its policy options are very limited.  It can raise its interest rates to try to prevent further declines in the value of its currency, but while this can help those with debts denominated in foreign currencies, it generally further depresses the local economy.&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt;

==Balancing mechanisms==
One of the three fundamental functions of an [[international monetary systems|international monetary system]] is to provide mechanisms to correct imbalances.&lt;ref name = "inside"&gt;{{Cite book

  | publisher =  Orion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scores of other text books old and new also give this definition, see for example ''International monetary relations: theory, history, and policy'' (1976), p. 611 by Leland B. Yeager. The other two basic functions are to provide liquidity and to impart confidence. While during the Washington Consensus period fewer emphasis was placed on the need for balance, in the main a requirement for correction was still accepted, though many argued that governments should leave such correction to the markets.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, there are three possible methods to correct BoP imbalances, though in practice a mixture including some degree of at least the first two methods tends to be used.  These methods are adjustments of exchange rates; adjustment of a nations internal prices along with its levels of demand; and rules based adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system,  rules based adjustment is mostly theoretical.&lt;/ref&gt; Improving productivity and hence competitiveness can also help, as can increasing the desirability of exports through other means, though it is generally assumed a nation is always trying to develop and sell its products to the best of its abilities.

===Rebalancing by changing the exchange rate===
An upwards shift in the value of a nation's currency relative to others will make a nation's exports less competitive and make imports cheaper and so will tend to correct a current account surplus. It also tends to make investment flows into the capital account less attractive so will help with a surplus there too.  Conversely a downward shift in the value of a nation's currency makes it more expensive for its citizens to buy imports and increases the competitiveness of their exports, thus helping to correct a deficit (though the solution often doesn't have a positive impact immediately due to the [[Marshall–Lerner condition]]).&lt;ref name = "solution"&gt;

Exchange rates can be adjusted by government&lt;ref&gt;Though except in the early years of the Bretton Woods System when international markets were heavily constrained by capital controls, managing the exchange rate has often been problematic as the markets often want the currency to move in the opposite direction to governments. Developing countries in particular would often experience difficulties, though even advanced economies like Britain had issues, with [[Black Wednesday]] an example when she had insufficient reserves to counter the market.&lt;/ref&gt;  in a rules based or managed currency regime, and when left to [[Floating exchange rate|float freely]] in the market they also tend to change in the direction that will restore balance. When a country is selling more than it imports, the demand for its currency will tend to increase as other countries ultimately&lt;ref&gt;There are commonly used financial instruments that allow importers to pay with their domestic currency, and the reserve asset will often play an intermediary role, but ultimately exporters require paying in their own currency.&lt;/ref&gt; need the selling country's currency to make payments for the exports. The extra demand tends to cause a rise of the currency's price relative to others.  When a country is importing more than it exports, the supply of its own currency on the international market tends to increase as it tries to exchange it for foreign currency to pay for its imports, and this extra supply tends to cause the price to fall.  BoP effects are not the only market influence on exchange rates however, they are also influenced by differences in national interest rates and by speculation.

===Rebalancing by adjusting internal prices and demand===
When exchange rates are fixed by a rigid gold standard,&lt;ref&gt;In practice there is typically still a small degree of [[exchange rate flexibility]] due to the cost of shipping gold between nations.&lt;/ref&gt; or when imbalances exist between members of a currency union such as the Eurozone, the standard approach to correct imbalances is by making changes to the domestic economy.  To a large degree, the change is optional for the surplus country, but compulsory for the deficit country.  In the case of a gold standard, the mechanism is largely automatic.  When a country has a favourable trade balance, as a consequence of selling more than it buys it will experience a net inflow of gold.  The natural effect of this will be to increase the money supply, which leads to inflation and an increase in prices, which then tends to make its goods less competitive and so will decrease its trade surplus.  However the nation has the option of taking the gold out of economy (sterilising the inflationary effect) thus building up a hoard of gold and retaining its favourable balance of payments. On the other hand, if a country has an adverse BoP it will experience a net loss of gold, which will automatically have a deflationary effect, unless it chooses to leave the gold standard. Prices will be reduced, making its exports more competitive, and thus correcting the imbalance. While the gold standard is generally considered to have been successful&lt;ref&gt;Though not problem free, see [http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/speeches/2009/sp191109.html Paper from the Bank of Canada on current imbalances in context of international monetary system history]&lt;/ref&gt; up until 1914, correction by deflation to the degree required by the large imbalances that arose after WWI proved painful, with deflationary policies contributing to prolonged unemployment but not re-establishing balance. Apart from the US most former members had left the gold standard by the mid-1930s.

A possible method for surplus countries such as Germany to contribute to re-balancing efforts when exchange rate adjustment is not suitable, is to increase its level of internal demand  (i.e. its spending on goods). While a current account surplus is commonly understood as the excess of earnings over spending, an alternative expression is that it is the excess of savings over investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

That is:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{CA} = \text{NS} - \text{NI}  \,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''CA'' = current account, ''NS'' = national savings (private plus government sector), ''NI'' = national investment.

If a nation is earning more than it spends the net effect will be to build up savings, except to the extent that those savings are being used for investment. If consumers can be encouraged to spend more instead of saving; or if the government runs a [[fiscal deficit]] to offset private savings; or if the corporate sector divert more of their profits to investment, then any current account surplus will tend to be reduced. However, in 2009 Germany amended its constitution to prohibit running a deficit greater than 0.35% of its GDP&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In their April 2010 world economic outlook report, the IMF presented a study showing how with the right choice of policy options governments can shift  away from a sustained current account surplus with no negative effect on growth and with a positive impact on unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Rules based rebalancing mechanisms===
Nations can agree to fix their exchange rates against each other,  and then correct any imbalances that arise by rules based and negotiated exchange rate changes and other methods.  The Bretton Woods system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates was an example of a rules based system. [[John Maynard Keynes]], one of the architects of the Bretton Woods system had wanted additional rules to encourage surplus countries to share the burden of rebalancing, as he argued that they were in a stronger position to do so and as he regarded their surpluses as negative [[Externality|externalities]] imposed on the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
Keynes suggested that traditional balancing mechanisms should be supplemented by the threat of confiscation of a portion of excess revenue if the surplus country did not choose to spend it on additional imports. However his ideas were not accepted by the Americans at the time. In 2008 and 2009,  American economist [[Paul Davidson (economist)|Paul Davidson]]  had been promoting his revamped form of Keynes's plan as a possible solution to global imbalances which in his opinion would expand growth all round without the downside risk of other rebalancing methods.&lt;ref name = "solution"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://econ.bus.utk.edu/november%20newsschool.pdf Reforming the worlds international money (pdf)] (2008) by Paul Davidson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="global_imbalances"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/reports/global_imbalances.pdf |title=Rebalancing the global economy: A Primer for Policymaking (p.174 et seq.) |format=PDF |publisher=[[Centre for Economic Policy Research]] (CEPR) |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of issues==
Historically, accurate balance of payments figures were not generally available.  However, this did not prevent a number of switches in opinion on questions relating to whether or not a nation’s government should use policy to encourage a favourable balance.

===Pre-1820: mercantilism===
Up until the early 19th century, international trade was generally very small in comparison with national output, and was often heavily regulated. In the Middle Ages, European trade was typically regulated at municipal level in the interests of security for local industry and for established merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Annual fairs would sometimes allow exceptions to the standard regulations.&lt;/ref&gt;  From about the 16th century, [[mercantilism]] became the dominant economic theory influencing European rulers, which saw local regulation replaced by national rules aiming to harness the countries' economic output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Measures to promote a trade surplus such as tariffs were generally favoured. Power was associated with wealth, and with low levels of growth, nations were best able to accumulate funds either by running trade surpluses or by forcefully confiscating the wealth of others.  Rulers sometimes strove to have their countries outsell competitors and so build up a "war chest" of gold.&lt;ref&gt;Silver and other precious commodities were also important sometimes, acting along with gold as part of a nation's ''de facto'' reserve asset.&lt;/ref&gt;

This era saw low levels of economic growth; average global per capita income is not considered to have significantly risen in the whole 800 years leading up to 1820, and is estimated to have increased on average by less than 0.1% per year between 1700 and 1820.&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt; With very low levels of financial integration between nations and with international trade generally making up a low proportion of individual nations' GDP,  BOP crises were very rare.&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt;

===1820–1914: free trade===
[[File:Gold bullion 1.jpg|thumb|Gold was the primary reserve asset during the gold standard era.]]
From the late 18th century, mercantilism was challenged by the ideas of [[Adam Smith]] and other economic thinkers favouring free trade. After victory in the [[Napoleonic wars]] Great Britain began promoting free trade, unilaterally reducing her trade tariffs.  Hoarding of gold was no longer encouraged, and in fact Britain exported more capital as a percentage of her [[national income]] than any other creditor nation has since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

According to historian [[Carroll Quigley]], Great Britain could afford to act benevolently&lt;ref&gt;However, some, like [[Otto von Bismarck]], viewed Great Britain's promotion of free trade as a way to maintain its dominant position [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a90945e4-fc91-11de-bc51-00144feab49a.html FT article]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 19th century due to the advantages of her geographical location, its naval power and economic ascendancy as the first nation to enjoy an [[industrial revolution]].&lt;ref name = "Hope"&gt;

A view advanced by economists such as [[Barry Eichengreen]] is that the first age of [[Globalization]] began with the laying of [[transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic telegraph cables]] in the 1860s, which facilitated a rapid increase in the already growing trade between Britain and America.&lt;ref name = "thenAndNow"/&gt;

Though Current Account controls were still widely used  (in fact all industrial nations apart from Great Britain and the Netherlands actually increased their tariffs and quotas in the decades leading up to 1914, though this was motivated more by a desire to protect "infant industries" than to encourage a trade surplus&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt;), [[Capital account#Capital controls|capital controls]] were largely absent, and people were generally free to cross international borders without requiring passports.

A [[gold standard]] enjoyed wide international participation especially from 1870, further contributing to close economic integration between nations.  The period saw substantial global growth, in particular for the volume of international trade which grew tenfold between 1820 and 1870 and then by about 4% annually from 1870 to 1914. BoP crises began to occur, though less frequently than was to be the case for the remainder of the 20th century. From 1880 to 1914, there were approximately&lt;ref&gt;Different economic historians don't always classify the same events as a BoP or twin crises&lt;/ref&gt;  8 BoP crises and 8 ''[[Twin Crises|twin crises]]''  – a twin crises being a BoP crises that coincides with a banking crises.&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt;

===1914–1945: deglobalisation===
{{see|deglobalization}}
The favorable economic conditions that had prevailed up until 1914 were shattered by the first world war, and efforts to re-establish them in the 1920s were not successful. Several countries rejoined the gold standard around 1925. But surplus countries didn't "play by the rules",&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One of the informal rules during the gold standard era was that countries running a trade surplus ought to allow the net inflow of gold they receive to increase their domestic money supply.  This would have an expansionary and possibly inflationary effect on their economies, helping to reverse the earlier trade surplus and thus correct the imbalance.  However central banks of surplus countries could choice not to allow the extra gold to circulate in their domestic economies, hoarding it in their vaults, and thus the burden of rebalancing would fall entirely on the deficit countries which may need to deflate their economies in order to reduce prices and regain competitiveness.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sterilization (economics)|sterilising]]  gold inflows to a much greater degree than had been the case in the pre-war period. Deficit nations such as Great Britain found it harder to adjust by deflation as workers were more enfranchised and unions in particular were able to resist downwards pressure on wages. During the [[Great Depression]]  most countries abandoned the gold standard, but imbalances remained an issue and international trade declined sharply.  There was a return to mercantilist type "beggar thy neighbour" policies, with countries competitively devaluing their exchange rates, thus effectively competing to export unemployment.  There were approximately 16 BoP crises and 15 twin crises (and a comparatively very high level of banking crises.)&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt;

===1945–1971: Bretton Woods===
{{Main|Bretton Woods system}}
Following World War II, the Bretton Woods institutions (the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[Bank for International Settlements|World Bank]]) were set up to support an [[international monetary systems|international monetary system]] designed to encourage free trade while also offering states options to correct imbalances without having to deflate their economies. Fixed but flexible exchange rates were established, with the system anchored by the dollar which alone remained convertible into gold.  The Bretton Woods system ushered in a period of high global growth, known as the [[Golden Age of Capitalism]], however it came under pressure due to the inability or unwillingness of governments to maintain effective capital controls&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
and due to instabilities related to the central role of the dollar.

Imbalances caused gold to flow out of the US and a loss of confidence in the United States ability to supply gold for all future claims by dollar holders resulted in escalating demands to convert dollars, ultimately causing the US to end the convertibility of the dollar into gold, thus ending the Bretton Woods system.&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt; The 1945–71 era saw approximately 24 BoP crises and no twin crises for advanced economies, with emerging economies seeing 16 BoP crises and just one twin crises.&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt;

===1971–2009: transition, Washington Consensus, Bretton Woods II===
{{Main|Washington Consensus}}
[[File:Manmohansingh04052007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Manmohan Singh]], Former PM of India, showed that the challenges caused by imbalances can be an opportunity when he led his country's successful economic reform programme after the [[1991 India economic crisis|1991 crisis]]. ]]
The Bretton Woods system came to an end between 1971 and 1973.  There were attempts to repair the system of fixed exchanged rates over the next few years, but these were soon abandoned, as were determined efforts for the U.S. to avoid BoP imbalances.  Part of the reason was [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displacement]] of the previous dominant economic paradigm – [[Keynesianism]] – by the Washington Consensus, with economists and economics writers such as [[Murray Rothbard]] and [[Milton Friedman]]&lt;ref&gt;e.g., in his influential ''[[Free to Choose]]'' TV series&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that there was no great need to be concerned about BoP issues.

In the immediate aftermath of the Bretton Woods collapse, countries generally tried to retain some control over their exchange rate by independently managing it, or by intervening in the [[foreign exchange market]] as part of a regional bloc, such as [[Snake in the tunnel|the Snake]] which formed in 1971.&lt;ref name = "inside"/&gt; ''The Snake'' was a group of European countries who tried to retain stable rates at least with each other; the group eventually evolved into the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) by 1979.  From the mid-1970s however, and especially in the 1980s and early 1990s, many other countries followed the US in liberalising controls on both their capital and current accounts, in adopting a somewhat relaxed attitude to their balance of payments and in allowing the value of their currency to float relatively freely with exchange rates determined mostly by the market.&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "inside"/&gt;

Developing countries who chose to allow the market to determine their exchange rates would often develop sizeable current account deficits, financed by capital account inflows such as loans and investments,&lt;ref&gt;In the 1970s and 1980s a significant part of the capital flowing into developing countries was re-cycled petro dollars, the oil producing countries were among the few to have large surpluses but at that time the US wasn't issuing many bonds so the capital tended to flow to developing countries via the intermediary of western investment banks.&lt;/ref&gt; though this often ended in crises when investors lost confidence.&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Heakal"&gt;

The frequency of crises was especially high for developing economies in this era – from 1973 to 1997 emerging economies suffered 57 BoP crises and 21 twin crises. Typically but not always the panic among foreign creditors and investors that preceded the crises in this period was usually triggered by concerns over excess borrowing by the private sector, rather than by a government deficit. For advanced economies, there were 30 BoP crises and 6 banking crises.

A turning point was the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|1997 Asian BoP Crisis]], where unsympathetic responses by western powers caused policy makers in emerging economies to re-assess the wisdom of relying on the free market; by 1999 the developing world as a whole stopped running current account deficits&lt;ref name = "wolfFix"/&gt; while the U.S. current account deficit began to rise sharply.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/historical/gands.txt U.S. Trade in Goods and Services – Balance of Payments 1960 thru 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

This new form of imbalance began to develop in part due to the increasing practice of emerging economies, principally China, in pegging their currency against the dollar, rather than allowing the value to freely float. The resulting state of affairs has been referred to as [[Bretton Woods II]].&lt;ref name ="BrettonWoodsII"/&gt;  According to Alaistair Chan, "At the heart of the imbalance is China's desire to keep the value of the [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] stable against the dollar.  Usually, a rising trade surplus leads to a rising value of the currency. A rising currency would make exports more expensive, imports less so, and push the trade surplus towards balance. China circumvents the process by intervening in exchange markets and keeping the value of the yuan depressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chan|first=Alaistair|title=The U.S. – China Balance of Payments Relationship|url=http://www.economy.com/dismal/article_free.asp?cid=112578|publisher=Moody's Analytics|accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to economics writer [[Martin Wolf]], in the eight years leading up to 2007, "three-quarters of the foreign currency reserves accumulated since the beginning of time have been piled up".&lt;ref name="revenge"&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast to the changed approach within the emerging economies, US policy makers and economists remained relatively unconcerned about BOP imbalances. In the early to mid-1990s, many free market economists and policy makers such as U.S. Treasury secretary [[Paul O'Neill (Secretary of the Treasury)|Paul O'Neill]] and Fed Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] went on record suggesting the growing US deficit was not a major concern. While several emerging economies had intervening to boost their reserves and assist their exporters from the late 1980s, they only began running a net current account surplus after 1999. This was mirrored in the faster growth for the US current account deficit from the same year, with surpluses, deficits and the associated buildup of reserves by the surplus countries reaching record levels by the early 2000s and growing year by year. Some economists such as [[Kenneth Rogoff]] and [[Maurice Obstfeld]] began warning that the record imbalances would soon need to be addressed from as early as 2001, joined by [[Nouriel Roubini]] in 2004, but it was not until about 2007 that their concerns began to be accepted by the majority of economists.&lt;ref name = "wolfFix-2"&gt;{{Cite book

There is now broad agreement that large imbalances between different countries do matter; for example mainstream U.S. economist [[C. Fred Bergsten]] has argued the U.S. deficit and the associated large inbound capital flows into the U.S. was one of the causes of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]].&lt;ref name="Bersten"/&gt;
Since the crisis, government intervention in BOP areas such as the imposition of  [[capital control]]s or foreign exchange market intervention has become more common and in general attracts less disapproval from economists, international institutions like the IMF and other governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In 2007, when the crises began, the global total of yearly BoP imbalances was $1680 billion.  On the credit side, the biggest current account surplus was China with approx. $362 billion, followed by Japan at $213 billion and Germany at £185 billion, with oil producing countries such as Saudi Arabia also having large surpluses.
On the debit side, the US had the biggest current account deficit at over $1100 billion, with the UK, Spain and Australia together accounting for close to a further $300 billion.&lt;ref name = "revenge"/&gt;

While there have been warnings of future cuts in public spending, deficit countries on the whole did not make these in 2009, in fact the opposite happened with increased public spending contributing to recovery as part of  [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence|global efforts to increase demand]].&lt;ref&gt;The public spending did not however make the imbalances worse as they were offset by reduced private sector demand and debt in the deficit countries.&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphases has instead been on the surplus countries, with the IMF, EU and nations such as the U.S., Brazil and Russia asking them to assist with the adjustments to correct the imbalances.

Japan had allowed her currency to appreciate through 2009, but has only limited scope to contribute to the rebalancing efforts thanks in part to her aging population. The euro used by Germany is allowed to float fairly freely in value, however further appreciation would be problematic for other members of the currency union such as Spain, Greece and Ireland who run large deficits. Therefore, Germany has instead been asked to contribute by further promoting internal demand, but this hasn't been welcomed by German officials.&lt;ref name = "IMFbaton"/&gt;

China has been requested to allow the [[renminbi]] to appreciate but until 2010 had refused, the position expressed by her premier [[Wen Jiabao]] being that by keeping the value of the renmimbi stable against the dollar China has been helping the global recovery, and that calls to let her currency rise in value have been motivated by a desire to hold back China's development.&lt;ref name = "dismiss"/&gt; After China reported favourable results for her December 2009 exports however, the Financial Times reported that analysts are optimistic that China will allow some appreciation of her currency around mid-2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In April 2010 a Chinese official signalled the government is considering allowing the renminbi to appreciate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

but by May analysts were widely reporting the appreciation would likely be delayed due to the falling value of the Euro following the [[2010 European sovereign debt crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

China announced the end of the renminbi's peg to the dollar in June 2010; the move was widely welcomed by markets and helped defuse tension over imbalances prior to the [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit]]. However the renminbi remains managed and the new flexibility means it can move down as well as up in value; two months after the peg ended the renminbi had only appreciated against the dollar by about 0.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 2011, the renminbi had appreciated against the dollar by 3.7%, which means it's on track to appreciate in nominal terms by 6% per year. As this reflects a real appreciation of 10% when China's higher inflation is accounted for, the U.S. Treasury once again declined to label China a currency manipulator in their February 2011 report to Congress. However Treasury officials did advise the rate of appreciation was still too slow for the best interests of the global economy.&lt;ref name ="Feb11USTreport"&gt;{{Cite web

In February 2011, [[Moody's]] analyst Alaistair Chan has predicted that despite a strong case for an upward revaluation, an increased rate of appreciation against the dollar is unlikely in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chan|first=Alaistair|title=The U.S. – China Balance of Payments Relationship|url=http://www.economy.com/dismal/article_free.asp?cid=112578|accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And as of February 2012, China's currency had been continuing to appreciate for a year and a half, while drawing remarkably little notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

While some leading surplus countries including China have been taking steps to boost domestic demand, these have not yet been sufficient to rebalance out of their current account surpluses. By June 2010, the U.S. monthly current account deficit had risen back to $50 billion, a level not seen since mid-2008. With the US currently suffering from high unemployment and concerned about taking on additional debt, fears are rising that the US may resort to [[Protectionism|protectionist]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

====Competitive devaluation after 2009====
{{Main|Currency war}}
By September 2010, international tensions relating to imbalances had further increased. Brazil's finance minister [[Guido Mantega]]  declared that an "international currency war" has broken out, with countries competitively trying to devalue their currency so as to boost exports. Brazil has been one of the few major economies lacking a reserve currency to abstain from significant [[currency intervention]], with the [[Brazilian real|real]] rising by 25% against the dollar since January 2009. Some economists such as Barry Eichengreen have argued that competitive devaluation may be a good thing as the net result will effectively be equivalent to expansionary global monetary policy. Others such as Martin Wolf saw risks of tensions further escalating and advocated that coordinated action for addressing imbalances should be agreed on at the November G20 summit.&lt;ref name = "new age"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Commentators largely agreed that little substantive progress was made on imbalances at the [[2010 G-20 Seoul summit|November 2010 G20]]. An IMF report released after the summit warned that without additional progress there is a risk of imbalances approximately doubling to reach pre-crises levels by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1133">A '''bargaining unit''', in [[labor relations]], is a group of employees with a clear and identifiable community of interests who are (under U.S. law) represented by a single [[labor union]] in [[collective bargaining]] and other dealings with management. Examples would be ''non-management professors'', ''law enforcement professionals'', ''blue-collar workers'', ''clerical and administrative employees'', etc.  Geographic location as well as the number of facilities included in bargaining units can be at issue during representation cases.

The size of a company does not relate to the size of a bargaining unit. Bargaining units must consist of at least three employees, and must have the support of a majority of employees in the bargaining unit. However, the bargaining unit can be a small portion of a large company where no other employees are members of a union.

'''Carlos Fermín Fitzcarrald''' (1862 &amp;ndash; 9 July 1897)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sevillano|first=Alfonso Cueva|title=Carlos Fermin Fitzcarrald |work=Diccionario histórico biográfico: peruanos ilustres|publisher=A.F.A. Editores Importadores|year=2004|pages= 222|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Peru]]vian [[Natural rubber|rubber]] [[Rubber boom|baron]]. He was born in [[San Luis, Ancash]]. 

==Rubber baron==
Fitzcarrald was the oldest son of an Irish-American sailor who later became a trader and married a Peruvian wife.&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jon Lee|title=An Isolated Tribe Emerges from the Rain Forest|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/08/an-isolated-tribe-emerges-from-the-rain-forest|accessdate=4 August 2016|publisher=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became established as a rubber baron in the late 19th century. Determined to find a way to transport rubber out of the [[Madre de Dios region]], he exploited native workers. He forced them  under pain of death to dismantle and transport a ship over a mountain during the turn-of-the-20th-century [[rubber boom]] in the [[Amazon Basin]].&lt;ref name="pantone"&gt;[http://www.iquitosnews.com/page14a.html Dan James Pantone, PhD., "The Myth of Fitzcarraldo"], ''Iquitos News and Travel'', 2004-2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1894, he explored the Madre de Dios region of [[BAP Fitzcarrald]] in [[Lake Sandoval]], Madre de Dios, Peru. He founded the City of [[Puerto Maldonado]] and explored the area that is now the [[Manú National Park|Manu Biosphere Reserve]]. To achieve this, it was necessary to transport his steam ship piece by piece over the mountains to the [[Madre de Dios basin]].&lt;ref name="pantone"/&gt;

Fitzcarrald discovered a short passage overland between the [[Mishagua River]], a tributary of the [[Urubamba River|Urubamba]], and the [[Manu River|Manu]], a tributary of the Madre de Dios River. The former leads into the [[Ucayali River]]. The [[Isthmus of Fitzcarrald]] was later named for him, as discovery of this route enabled transport of rubber from the Madre de Dios region. It was transferred to ships on the Mishagua, which could reach the Urubamba, the [[Ucayali River]] and thereby down the Amazon to markets and Atlantic ports for export.&lt;ref name="pantone"/&gt; 

His expeditions into the Madre de Dios region are considered to be the root of the modern-day divide between the local [[Yine people|Yine]] and [[Mashco-Piro_people|Mashco Piro]] peoples. The Yine are the descendants of the natives that Fitzcarrald forced to work for him, while the Mascho are the descendants of the natives that fled following Fitzcarrald's arrival.&lt;ref name=anderson /&gt;

He died at age 35 when his ship ''Contamana'' sank in Urubamba in an accident.&lt;ref name="pantone"/&gt;

==Legacy==
* The [[Carlos Fermín Fitzcarrald Province]] was named after him.
* [[Puerto Maldonado]] has a place to view the sunken remains of Fitzcarrald's steam ship, the ''Contamana,'' which is located in the Madre de Dios River. 
* Fitzcarrald's exploits inspired director and writer [[Werner Herzog]]'s film ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]'' (1982), which symbolizes the extremes generated during the rubber boom.&lt;ref name="pantone"/&gt;

'''Cecil Commerce Center''' (CCC) is a commercial and industrial center in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. It is located on Jacksonville's [[Westside (Jacksonville)|Westside]] on the former [[Naval Air Station Cecil Field]], and includes [[Cecil Airport]]. The 17 thousand-acre center represents more than three percent of the land area in [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]], most of it zoned for development. The property was conveyed to the City of Jacksonville and converted to its current use between 1999 and 2002.

==History==
In July 1993, former [[Naval Air Station Cecil Field]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] was recommended for closure by the [[1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission|Base Realignment and Closure Commission]]. In response to the decision to close NAS Cecil Field, the Mayor of Jacksonville established the Cecil Field Development Commission, succeeded by the Jacksonville Economic Development Commission (JEDC), and later the Office of Economic Development (OED). One of the major responsibilities of the commission was to develop a proposed base reuse plan that would guide the transition of NAS Cecil Field from a fully operational Navy base to civilian use.

In 1996, the NAS Cecil Field Final Base Reuse Plan was approved and in March 1999, the [[Jacksonville City Council]] approved the Cecil Commerce Center Operations and Business Plan.
The plan projected that businesses at the CCC would have 5,600 employees by 2009 and 25,000 by 2019.&lt;ref name=STOP /&gt; Between July 1999 and April 2002, property was conveyed to the JEDC (now the OED), Jacksonville Aviation Authority (JAA), the City of Jacksonville Parks Department and Clay County.

Existing recreational facilities within the area were included with surrounding acreage to create the [[Cecil Recreation Complex]], which was expanded to create the [[Jacksonville Equestrian Center]], Cecil Aquatic Center, and other new recreation opportunities.

Since the time of the conveyance of approximately {{convert|8300|acre|km2}}, the OED has worked to promote the site as a prime location for companies in the manufacturing, industrial-related and distribution industries, as well as other uses including support retail and office space along the main roads.

The [[Jacksonville Aviation Authority]] controls the land surrounding the airport and south of Normandy Boulevard. Several aviation companies have leased all the former Navy hangars at the airport. Most of this area was developed by the Navy before the base was closed. Land to the north of Normandy Boulevard is controlled by the city of Jacksonville, and is mostly wetlands. Many sites require four feet of fill, establishing drainage and building a road to the parcel from New World Avenue, the main thoroughfare connecting Normandy with Cecil Commerce Center Parkway. There is also no railroad service at CCC, so if a business needed it, the city would need to pay for a spur that crosses Interstate 10.&lt;ref name=STOP /&gt;
 
The biggest development goal was to attract a mega-project, such as an aircraft or vehicle assembly plant which would employ thousands. Those projects usually depend on incentives, and competition among the states of North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Florida is intense. CCC has competed for several big deals, including an aircraft manufacturing plant for [[Boeing]], a complex for [[Spirit AeroSystems]], and a van assembly plant for [[DaimlerChrysler]].&lt;ref name=STOP /&gt;

The Cecil Commerce Center Parkway and I-10 interchange was completed in October, 2009. The $62 million project provided direct access to Cecil Commerce Center and was the first section of the new, regional [[First Coast Expressway]]. In 2009, the actual number of people employed at CCC in 2009 was approximately 2,000, just one third of the projected number.&lt;ref name=STOP&gt;{{cite news|last=Bauerlein|first=David|title=What's stopped Cecil Commerce Center's growth?|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2009-10-03/story/whats-stopped-cecil-commerce-centers-growth|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=Florida Times-Union|date=October 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, 2010, the city signed a contract with Hillwood as Master Developer for CCC to  
expedite development, provide expertise, strategy and private capital for the long term project.&lt;ref name=HILL&gt;{{cite web|title=Hillwood Master Developer Agreement|url=http://www.coj.net/departments/office-of-economic-development/cecil-commerce-center-%281%29/hillwood.aspx|work=June 8, 2010|publisher=City of Jacksonville|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current developments==
* As master developer of approximately 4,475 acres of City-owned property at Cecil Commerce Center, Hillwood branded the site with their premiere brand name – AllianceFlorida at Cecil Commerce Center. Hillwood agreed to invest more than $1.3 billion to develop the entire 31-million-square-foot master plan. These developments will attract the companies that will bring thousands of new jobs and expand the tax base.&lt;ref name=HILL /&gt;
* FlightStar, a heavy aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul contractor, is constructing a $27 million, 30,000 sq. ft. hangar expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2014. They will hire an additional 400 people, bringing their total employment at Cecil Commerce Center to more than 800.
* [[Florida State College at Jacksonville]] completed construction of a state of the art truck driving facility at their North Cecil Campus.
* Boeing moved its F-18 repair operations to Cecil Commerce Center, creating 60 jobs in Jacksonville. Boeing leased a city-owned building and invested $4 million in tenant improvements and equipment.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
* SAFT America, Inc., a world leader in the design and manufacture of high-technology batteries, constructed a 277,560 sq. ft. lithium battery manufacturing plant on 12 acres at Cecil. SAFT invested more than $200 million in new capital and employs 279 people at the new facility.
* [[Bridgestone#North America|Bridgestone Americas]] Tire Operations purchased 63.3 acres in Cecil Commerce Center North and constructed a 1-million-square-foot distribution center. The site employs 250 people and represents a private capital investment of $44 million.
* Florida State College at Jacksonville completed phase one of a new, 44,000-square-foot center in Cecil Commerce Center North. The new campus offers general education courses.

The '''Detroit People Mover''' ('''DPM''') is a {{convert|2.94|mi|km|adj=on}} [[people mover|automated people mover]] system which operates on a single track, and encircles [[Downtown Detroit|Downtown]] [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name=DPM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeoplemover.com/Overview.id.26.htm |title=The Detroit People Mover - Overview |publisher=Thepeoplemover.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730055100/http://www.thepeoplemover.com/Overview.id.26.htm |archivedate=2013-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The People Mover uses [[Urban Transportation Development Corporation]] [[Intermediate Capacity Transit System]] Mark I technology and the cars are driverless. A [[Siding (rail)|siding]] allows the system to be used in a two-way bypass manner when part of the circular track is closed.

The [[QLine]] [[streetcar]] serves as a link between the Detroit People Mover and [[Detroit station|New Center Amtrak station]], plus additional access to [[Detroit Department of Transportation|DDOT]] and [[Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation|SMART]] bus routes as part of a comprehensive network of [[transportation in metropolitan Detroit]].&lt;ref name=SEMCOGrail&gt;[http://www.semcog.org/AADD.aspx Ann Arbor - Detroit Regional Rail Project] ''SEMCOG''. Retrieved on February 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Detroit People Mover has its origins in 1966, with Congressional creation of the [[Urban Mass Transportation Administration]] (UMTA) to develop new types of transit.  In 1975, following the failure to produce any large-scale results and increased pressure to show results, UMTA created the Downtown People Mover Program (DPM) and sponsored a nationwide competition that offered federal funds to cover much of the cost of planning and construction of such a system. UMTA reviewed thirty-five full proposals. From these, they selected proposals from Cleveland, Houston, Los Angeles, and St. Paul.  In addition, UMTA decided they would approve proposals from Baltimore, Detroit, and Miami to develop People Mover systems if they could do so with existing grant commitments.  Of the seven cities with UMTA approval for their People Mover proposals, only Detroit and Miami persevered to build and operate systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/jbs/itrans/dpmhist.htm |title=The Downtown People Mover Program |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ford Motor Company was involved in one of the designs of the People Mover and had hired AlScott Service Company to design and build a room size working model of the system. This model was used for Ford's proposals in their attempt to build the system.&lt;ref&gt;AlScott Service company, Detroit Michigan&lt;/ref&gt;

The People Mover was intended to be the downtown distributor for a proposed city and metro-wide light rail transit system for Detroit in the early 1980s; however, funding was scaled back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shrinkingcities.com/fileadmin/shrink/downloads/pdfs/WP-Band_III_Detroit.pdf|author=Phillipp Oswalt|title=Shrinking Cities, |page=93|accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  President Gerald Ford had promised 600 million in federal funds. Plans included a subway line along Woodward Avenue that would turn into a street level train at McNichols and eventually go all the way to Pontiac, with additional rail lines running along Gratiot and a commuter line between Detroit and Port Huron. Inability of local leaders to come to an agreement led to the 600 million commitment being withdrawn by the Reagan Administration. Yet the People Mover still moved forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/how-detroit-ended-up-with-the-worst-public-transit/Content?oid=2143889|author=Ryan Felton|title=How Detroit ended up with the worst public transit|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of planning, the system was projected to have a ridership of 67,700 daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicpurpose.com/ut-lvmono-0006.pdf|author=Wendell Cox|title=Analysis of the Proposed Las Vegas LLC Monorail|page=14|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DPM train enters Grand Circus station.jpg|thumb|left|[[Grand Circus Park (Detroit People Mover)|Grand Circus Park Station]]]]
The People Mover is owned and operated by the Detroit Transportation Corporation (DTC). The DTC was incorporated in 1985 as a Michigan Public Body Corporate for the purpose of acquiring, owning, constructing, furnishing, equipping, completing, operating, improving, enlarging, and/or disposing of the Central Automated Transit Systems (CATS) in Detroit, Michigan. DTC acquired the CATS project from the Suburban Mobile Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART) formerly known as the Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA), on October 4, 1985. The DTC was created by the City of Detroit, Michigan pursuant to Act 7 of Public Acts of 1967 and is a component unit of the City of Detroit and accounts its activity as per proprietary funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/treasury/827649DetroitTransportationCorp20101230_342148_7.pdf|title=Summary of Significant Account Policies|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CATS project, aka the Downtown People Mover (DPM), officially opened to the public on July 31, 1987. Prior to November 18, 1988, the People Mover System was operated and maintained by the primary contractor, Urban Transportation Development Corporation (UTDC) on a month-to-month basis. On November 18, 1988, the DTC assumed the responsibility to operate and maintain the People Mover System.

The system opened in 1987 using the same technology as [[Vancouver]]'s [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] and [[Toronto]]'s [[Scarborough RT|Scarborough RT line]]. In the first year, an average of 11,000 riders used the People Mover each day; the one-day record was 54,648.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/jbs/itrans/detroit.htm |title=Detroit downtown peoplemover, advanced automated urban transit |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date=2008-06-29 |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the People Mover opened, it ran counter-clockwise.  On July 20, 2008, the system was shut down temporarily to replace track on six of the curves along the route. When it reopened in August, the system was run clockwise, as it is still run today, although it can run in either direction when necessary. The change in direction reduced the time required to complete one round-trip. The clockwise direction has one short, relatively steep uphill climb and then coasts downhill for a majority of the ride, allowing the train to use gravity to accelerate. This makes each round-trip slightly faster than running uphill most of the way in the counter-clockwise direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeoplemover.com/resource/attach/69/DPMAug16OpeningPressReleaseFinal.doc |title=Detroit People Mover Reopens and Makes Changes |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214114219/http://www.thepeoplemover.com/resource/attach/69/DPMAug16OpeningPressReleaseFinal.doc |archivedate=2012-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2015 at approximately 10:10 PM, one of the cars jumped a rail hitting the rail platform. This prompted the system to be temporarily shut down to allow an investigation to take place. After 17 hours of investigation, the system resumed service. According to a media release given by the inspectors, "A bracket beneath one of the People Mover cars dislodged, catching under the rear car of the train approaching Times Square Station. This caused the rear car to come out of alignment and leave the rail. As a result, the second car scraped the platform, dislodging the door as the train pulled into the station."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2015/01/23/detroit-people-mover-reopens/22209817/|title=People Mover Resumes Service|date=2015-01-24|accessdate=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost-effectiveness and use===
[[File:Detroit December 2015 62 (Detroit People Mover).jpg|thumb|The Detroit People Mover approaching [[Joe Louis Arena (Detroit People Mover)|Joe Louis Arena]]]]

The Mover costs $12 million annually in city and state subsidies to run.&lt;ref name="detnews"/&gt; The cost-effectiveness of the Mover has drawn criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Braun |first=Ken |url=http://www.mackinac.org/9137 |title=The Detroit People Mover Still Serves as "a Rich Folks’ Roller Coaster" [Michigan Capitol Confidential&amp;#93; |publisher=Mackinac.org |date=2007-12-11 |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In every year between 1997 and 2006, the cost per passenger mile exceeded $3, and was $4.26 in 2009,&lt;ref name=speroforum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speroforum.com/a/49326/Pricey-pensions-for-Detroits-rollercoaster-for-rich-people |title=Pricey pensions for Detroit's roller-coaster for rich people |publisher=Speroforum.com |date=2011-02-27 |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared with Detroit bus routes that operate at $0.82&lt;ref name=speroforum/&gt; (the [[New York City Subway]] operates at $0.30 per passenger mile).  The [[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]] also charges that the system does not benefit locals, pointing out that fewer than 30% of the riders are Detroit residents and that Saturday ridership (likely out-of-towners) dwarfs that of weekday usage.&lt;ref name=detnews&gt;[http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061223/METRO/612230387/1003 People Mover grows up]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was designed to move up to 15 million riders a year. In 2008 it served approximately 2 million riders. This meant the system averaged about 7,500 people per day, about 2.5 percent of its daily peak capacity of 288,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apta.com/research/stats/ridership/riderep/documents/08q1rep.pdf ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1215/is_n7_v199/ai_20996430 | work=Railway AgeIn fiscal year 1999-2000 the city was spending $3 for every $0.50 rider fare, according to ''[[The Detroit News]]''.  | title=Is there people-mover in your future? | first=Marybeth | last=Luczak | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Mover filled less than 10 percent of its seats.&lt;ref name=detnews/&gt;

{{asof|2016}}, passengers pay $0.75 per trip, with discounts for seniors and multiple rides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Detroit People Mover Proposed Fare Structure |publisher=Detroit Transportation Corporation |url=http://www.thepeoplemover.com/resource/attach/2587/DetroitPeopleMoverFareStructure.pdf |accessdate=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fare was originally 50 cents until it was raised to the current rate in November 2011. 

Among the busiest periods was the five days around the 2006 [[Super Bowl XL]], when 215,910 patrons used the service.&lt;ref&gt;Detroit Transportation Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to major downtown concerts and sporting events, other high ridership times include the week of the annual [[North American International Auto Show]] in January and the [[Youmacon]] anime convention at the end of October, ever since the convention expanded in 2012 to utilize [[Cobo Center]] in addition to the Renaissance Center. The system had 92,384 riders during the 2014 extended con weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexander |first=Ericka |url=http://www.thepeoplemover.com/dpm-is-the-place-to-be-for-youmacon-2015-find-out-why/ |title=DPM is the Place to Be for Youmacon 2015 - Find out why!" |publisher=DTC Marketing |date=2015-10-13 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the downtown area has changed, this has impacted service and access to certain stations although the overall route and placement of the stations remains the same. When the [[J. L. Hudson Department Store]] building was imploded in October 1998, the nearby part of the track was damaged and forced the system to shut down. Before the track was completely repaired about a year later, limited service went into effect. In 2000, the [[David Whitney Building]] closed, cutting off access to the [[Grand Circus Park (Detroit People Mover)|Grand Circus Park Station]]. The station later reopened without handicapped access as that was inside the David Whitney Building, which eventually reopened in late 2014. During construction of [[Compuware World Headquarters]] and parking garage, the Cadillac Center stop was closed as part of the parking structure was built around it. The station remained largely untouched and unmodified although the entrance was slightly expanded to allow a direct walkway to the nearby parking garage staircase and elevator tower.

In 2002, the concrete berms in front of the [[Renaissance Center]] were removed to make it more inviting to the rest of downtown. This also required the demolition of the station and [[tile art]]work by [[George Woodman]]. Limited service continued but once again, ridership dropped significantly (see graph below) until the station and section of track were rebuilt to restore full circular operations in 2004. To replace the old artwork, Woodman designed a new tile art piece called Path Games.

As part of the restoration of the David Whitney Building, the Grand Circus Park station was closed on August 16, 2014 to complete a facelift which was originally planned to open in January 2015. The improved station will now feature ADA accessibility independently of the David Whitney Building. The project is overseen by Dumas Concepts in Building. The Grand Circus Park station officially reopened on June 13, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2015/06/13/people-movers-grand-circus-park-station-reopens/ |title=People Mover’s Grand Circus Park Station Reopens |publisher=CBS Detroit |date=2015-06-13 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the closure, the 2014 ridership level of that station dropped to 72,774 (12 out of the 13 stations). For comparison, the 2013 ridership level at Grand Circus was 136,255.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence |first=Eric D |url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2015/06/24/grand-circus-people-mover/29246171/ |title=People Mover's Grand Circus Station back in service |publisher=Detroit Free Press |date=2015-06-24 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
There have been proposals to extend the People Mover northward to the [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]] and neighborhoods not within walking distance of the city's downtown. A proposal was put forward by Marsden Burger, former manager of the People Mover, to double the length of the route by extending the People Mover along [[List of buildings located along Woodward Avenue, Detroit|Woodward Avenue]] to West Grand Boulevard and into the New Center area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drcurryassociates.net/DetroitPeopleMover2.html |title=DetroitPeopleMover2 |publisher=Drcurryassociates.net |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; New stops would have included the [[Detroit (Amtrak station)|Amtrak station]], [[Wayne State University]] and the cultural center, the [[Detroit Medical Center]], and the [[Henry Ford Hospital]]. The plan was proposed at a tentative cost of $150–200 million, and would have been paid for by a combination of public and private financing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Detroit News]][http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061223/METRO/612230387]&lt;/ref&gt; It was ultimately decided that the system would instead be connected to New Center by a [[QLine|streetcar line]] following much of the proposed route.

==Operations and maintenance==
The People Mover is owned and operated by the [[Detroit Transportation Corporation]], an agency of the Detroit city government.

The People Mover system's operations center is located at the Times Square Station. Housed in the same complex is the system's maintenance facility and storage of the cars in an indoor facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://subwaynut.com/detroit/times_square/index.php |title=Times Square(Detroit People Mover) |publisher=The SubwayNut |date=2011-10-28 |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cars enter south turnout to enter the maintenance facility and exit from the north turn out back onto the main track. Maintenance equipment (work cars, etc...) are lifted up to track level by crane, but not stored with the DPM cars.

===Work cars===

Work cars are not maintained or owned by DPM, but by contractors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeoplemover.com/resource/attach/28/DTCrailgrindingtechSpecMar102of3.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523021748/https://www.thepeoplemover.com/resource/attach/28/DTCrailgrindingtechSpecMar102of3.doc |archivedate=2012-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stations==
The DPM stops at 13 stations, eight of which were built into existing buildings.  As the system is single tracked, the stations only have a single platform setup. Originally, the 13 stations were planned not to have any distinctive features. However, in 1984 after construction had recently begun, Irene Walt assembled a volunteer committee to persuade the project agency to include artwork in each station. Called the Downtown Detroit People Mover Art Commission (later known as Art in the Stations), they raised $2 million to finance the project. As a result, there are 18 new original pieces of art spread throughout the stations, plus a piece from 1903 that had previously been in storage, on permanent loan from the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]. The commissions efforts and art installation were documented in a 30-minute film by Sue Marx and Pamela Conn, who had recently won an Academy Award for the short documentary [[Young at Heart (1987 film)|Young at Heart]]. Art in the Stations premiered at the Detroit Institute of Arts in 1989. In 2004, the book Art in the Stations was published, with photographs by [[Balthazar Korab]], containing information on all the station artwork and the artists who created them.

'''Downtown Grand Forks''' is the original commercial center of [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]]. Located on the western bank of the [[Red River of the North]], the downtown neighborhood is situated near the fork of the Red River and the [[Red Lake River]]. While downtown is no longer the dominant commercial area of the [[Greater Grand Forks]] community, it remains the historic center of Grand Forks.  An {{convert|80.4|acre|adj=on}} portion was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2005, as '''Downtown Grand Forks Historic District'''.  Today, downtown Grand Forks is home to many offices, stores, restaurants, and bars.

==History==

===Early history===
[[Image:Third Street, Grand Forks, ND.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Third Street looking north]]
[[Image:Downtown Grand Forks, ND circa 1909.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Third Street looking south]]
Grand Forks was first settled in 1870. In 1872, seven pioneers staked claims to land on the Red River.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3"/&gt;  The {{convert|9|acre|m2|adj=on}} piece of land that would become downtown Grand Forks was first platted by Grand Forks' "founding father", [[Alexander Griggs]], and his wife Etta, in 1875.  This was done in anticipation of the [[Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad]] (later the [[St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway]] and eventually the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]]).&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3"/&gt; A collection of wood-frame buildings quickly sprouted up and, by 1880, the new city was home to 1,705 residents.  The city was incorporated on February 22, 1881.

The coming of the Saint Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba Railway in 1880 led to dramatic growth. New multiple-story brick buildings replaced the old wood structures. The Hotel Dacotah, the St. John's Block, and the Security Building - all five stories - were witness to the fact that the city was prospering and that downtown Grand Forks was becoming one of the busiest commercial districts in the region. By the dawn of the 20th century, downtown Grand Forks had become the commercial, transportation, health care, entertainment, and cultural center of the region and boasted many amenities.

===The 20th Century===
[[Image:Downtown Grand Forks, ND circa 1912.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Downtown Grand Forks, circa 1912]]
[[Image:DeMers Avenue, Grand Forks, ND.jpg|200px|left|thumb|DeMers Avenue]]
Throughout the early and mid parts of the 20th Century, downtown Grand Forks was easily the dominant commercial neighborhood in Grand Forks. In the later part of the century, the coming of the Interstate Highway System, urban renewal, and new commercial developments on the outskirts of the city signaled the start of a period of decline for downtown. Major shopping malls ([[Grand Cities Mall|South Forks Plaza]] in 1964 and [[Columbia Mall (Grand Forks)|Columbia Mall]] in 1978) relocated much of the commercial activity which had once been centered downtown. Over time, institutions which had once been a major part of downtown - the city's hospitals, post office, and public library - were replaced with new facilities outside of downtown.

A major downtown urban renewal project during the 1960s and 1970s saw the destruction of whole downtown blocks in favor of new office building, a city auditorium, and a new street overpass spanning the Grand Forks rail yards. Built in large part as a response to the new shopping malls in Grand Forks, the [[City Center Mall (Grand Forks)|City Center Mall]] saw the blocking off of one whole block of South Third Street to vehicular traffic. A roof was built over the street and the entire one-block section became an indoor shopping center. The City Center mall was, in large part, a failure. The 1980s and 1990s saw little development taking place downtown. Indeed, several major businesses such as Griffith's Department Store, Norby's Department Store, and Silverman's clothing store either moved elsewhere within the city or shuttered their doors forever.

===Flood of 1997===
[[Image:DowntownGrandForksMap.png|right|thumb|300px|Simplified map of downtown Grand Forks]]
The [[1997 Red River Flood|Red River Flood of 1997]] devastated downtown Grand Forks. The entire district was inundated with several feet of water and a major fire destroyed eleven historic buildings. An iconic image of the flood was the flooded and charred shell of the old five-story Security Building on North Third Street.

After the flood, a renewed effort was put into revitalizing downtown. A new Grand Forks Corporate Center was built in the center of downtown to replace office space which had been destroyed by the flood and fire. Remodeling of the old Empire Theater, which had been started before the flood, was completed and the building became known as the [[Empire Arts Center]]. The roof of the City Center Mall was removed and historic storefronts were once again visible. Other building projects following the flood included a new office building for the ''[[Grand Forks Herald]]'', a new office building for [[Grand Forks County, North Dakota|Grand Forks County]], a new "Town Square" community plaza, and the remodeling of countless downtown properties including the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Grand Forks, North Dakota)|Metropolitan Opera House]] and the former First National Bank (now [[Alerus Financial]]) building.

===Historic district===
The Downtown Grand Forks Historic District is a {{convert|80.4 |acre|adj=on}} [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]] that was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2005.  The area is also known as the '''Grand Forks Original Townsite''' and as the '''Central Business District'''.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

The National Register nomination includes some significant dates:&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3"/&gt;
* 1872, when settlers staked claims on the Red River
* 1875, when the town was platted
* 1880, when the Saint Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba Railway reached the city and was constructed through the center of downtown
* 1885, when a branch line of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] reached the town
* 1997, when the Red River flood covered all of downtown, and the resulting flood and fire damage brought significant destruction and then reconstruction

Architects who designed buildings in the area include [[Buechner &amp; Orth]], [[Joseph Bell DeRemer]], [[Cass Gilbert]], [[Theodore B. Wells]], and others.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=05001475}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Downtown Grand Forks Historic District / Grand Forks Original Townsite / Central Business District (CBD) |author=Ann Emmons and Jed Little |date=July 2005 |publisher=[[National Park Service]]}} and {{NRHP url|id=05001475|title=''Accompanying 13 photos from 2004''|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When listed, the district included 42 [[contributing buildings]], four [[contributing structures]], and 15 non-contributing buildings.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;  The area was surveyed in a 1981 study of Downtown Grand Forks historical resources.

===Downtown today===
In recent years, a number of new stores and restaurants have opened up downtown:

Brothers Firearms - Gun Shop
Half Brothers Brewery - Brew Pub
Now or Never - Nutrition Place 
Rhombus Guys Brewery - Brew Pub
Sky's - Restaurant and Lounge
Tea &amp; Crepes - Crepe and Ice cream place

The city has recently been encouraging the construction of new apartments and condos in the downtown area.  Several new and remodeled buildings offer upscale housing in stand-alone buildings or above businesses for varying prices.

Also, a [http://www.tsfarmersmarket.com farmer's market] is held every Saturday (9AM to 2PM) from mid-June to mid-September in the Town Square on the corner of 3rd Street S. and DeMers Avenue.&lt;ref name="farmersmarket"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitgrandforks.com/main.php/family |title=Family Fun |accessdate=2007-06-05 |work=Greater Grand Forks Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each June, the downtown area and the neighboring [[Greater Grand Forks Greenway]] play host to the [[Grand Cities Art Fest]].

'''Downtown Los Angeles''' ('''DTLA''') is the [[central business district]] of [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], as well as a diverse [[neighborhood|residential neighborhood]] of some 58,000 people. A 2013 study found that the district is home to over 500,000 jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Downtown LA Demographic Study 2013|url=http://www.downtownla.com/survey-2013-results.asp|accessdate=3 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027004505/http://www.downtownla.com/survey-2013-results.asp|archivedate=27 October 2015|website=DowntownLA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also part of [[Central Los Angeles]].

A heritage of the city's founding in 1781, Downtown Los Angeles today is composed of different areas ranging from a [[fashion]] district to [[Skid Row, Los Angeles|Skid Row]]. It is the hub for the city's [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|urban rail transit system]] and the [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]] commuter rail system for Southern California.

Banks, [[department stores]], and [[movie palaces]] at one time drew residents and visitors into the area, but the district declined economically and suffered a downturn for decades until its recent renaissance starting in the early 2000s. Old buildings are being modified for new uses, and skyscrapers have been built.

Downtown Los Angeles is known for its government buildings, parks, theaters, and other public places.

{{ further|History of Los Angeles }}

===Early years===
The earliest known settlements in the area of what is now Downtown Los Angeles was by the [[Tongva people|Tongva]], a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people. Later European settlement arrived after Father [[Juan Crespí]], a Spanish missionary charged with exploring sites for [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Spanish missions in California|missions in California]], noted in 1769 that the region had "all the requisites for a large settlement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/la/historic/crespi.html FATHER CRESPI IN LOS ANGELES, USC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707155441/http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/la/historic/crespi.html |date=July 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 4, 1781, the city was founded by a group of settlers who trekked north from present-day Mexico.

Land speculation increased in the 1880s, which saw the population of the city explode from 11,000 in 1880 to nearly 100,000 by 1896.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downtownla.com/5_05_downtownHistory.asp Downtown History, Downtown Center Business Improvement District] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804025547/http://www.downtownla.com/5_05_downtownHistory.asp |date=August 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infrastructure enhancements and the laying of a street grid eventually brought development south of the original settlement into what is today the [[Civic Center, Los Angeles|Civic Center]] and [[Historic Core, Los Angeles|Historic Core]] neighborhoods.

===Downtown's golden age===
By 1920, the city's private and municipal rail lines were the most far-flung and most comprehensive in the world in mileage, even besting that of [[New York City]]. By this time, a steady influx of residents and aggressive land developers had transformed the city into a large metropolitan area, with DTLA at its center. Rail lines connected four counties with over {{convert|1100|mi|km|sp=us}} of track.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westworld.com/~elson/larail/PE/tunnel.html Westworld. 2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503130518/http://www.westworld.com/~elson/larail/PE/tunnel.html |date=May 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early part of the 20th century, banking institutions clustered around South Spring Street, forming the [[Spring Street Financial District]]. Sometimes referred to as the "[[Wall Street of the West]],"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/11/local/me-39908 Wall Street of the West Had Its Peaks, Crashes]", ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; the district held corporate headquarters for financial institutions including [[Bank of America]], [[Farmers and Merchants Bank of Los Angeles|Farmers and Merchants Bank]], the [[Crocker National Bank]], California Bank &amp; Trust, and International Savings &amp; Exchange Bank. The [[Pacific Exchange|Los Angeles Stock Exchange]] was also located on the corridor from 1929 until 1986 before moving into a new building across the [[Interstate 110 (California)|Harbor (110) Freeway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicartinla.com/Downtown/Broadway/stock_exchange.html |title=Salvatore Cartaino Scarpitta, Los Angeles Stock Exchange, bas reliefs |publisher=Publicartinla.com |date=1929-10-29 |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial growth brought with it hotel construction—during this time period several grand hotels, the Alexandria (1906), the Rosslyn (1911), and the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore]] (1923), were erected — and also the need for venues to entertain the growing population of Los Angeles. [[Broadway Theater and Commercial District|Broadway]] became the nightlife, shopping and entertainment district of the city, with over a dozen theater and movie palaces built before 1932.

Department stores also opened flagship stores downtown, including [[The Broadway]], Hamburger &amp; Sons, [[May Department Stores|May Company]], [[JW Robinson's]], and [[Bullock's]], serving a wealthy residential population in the [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles|Bunker Hill]] neighborhood. Numerous specialty stores also flourished including those in the jewelry business which gave rise to the Downtown Jewelry District. Among these early jewelers included the Laykin Diamond Company (later becoming Laykin et Cie [http://www.laykinetcie.com]) and [[Harry Winston]] &amp; Co., both of which found their beginnings in the [[Hotel Alexandria]] at Fifth and Spring streets.

The [[Los Angeles Union Station|Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal]] (Union Station) opened in May 1939, unifying passenger service among various local, regional, and long-distance passenger trains. It was built on a grand scale and would be one of the "last of the great railway stations" built in the United States.

===Decline and redevelopment===
[[File:Angels flight los angeles.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Angels Flight]], November 2008]]
Following [[World War II]], [[suburbanization]], the development of the Los Angeles freeway network, and increased automobile ownership led to decreased investment downtown. Many corporate headquarters slowly dispersed to new suburbs or fell to mergers and acquisitions. The once-wealthy [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles|Bunker Hill]] neighborhood became a haven for low-income renters, its stately Victorian mansions turned into [[flophouse]]s.

From about 1930 onward, numerous very old and historic buildings in the plaza area were demolished to make way for street-level parking lots, the high demand for parking making this more profitable than any other option that might have allowed preservation. The drastic reduction in the number of residents in the area further reduced the viability of streetfront businesses that would be able to attract pedestrians. For most Angelenos, downtown became a drive-in, drive-out destination.

In an effort to combat [[Urban decay|blight]] and lure businesses back downtown, the city's [[Community redevelopment agency|Community Redevelopment Agency]] undertook the [[Bunker Hill Redevelopment Project]] in 1955, a massive clearance project that leveled homes and cleared land for future commercial skyscraper development. This period saw the clearing and upzoning of the entire neighborhood, as well as the shuttering of the [[Angels Flight]] funicular railway in 1969. Angels Flight resumed operation in 1996 for a period of five years, shutting down once again after a fatal accident in 2001. On March 15, 2010, the railway once again opened for passenger service following extensive upgrades to brake and safety systems.

With [[Class A office space]] becoming available on Bunker Hill, many of DTLA's remaining financial corporations moved to the newer buildings, leaving the former [[Spring Street Financial District]] devoid of tenants above ground floor. Following the corporate headquarters' moving six blocks west, the large department stores on Broadway shuttered, culminating in the 1980s.

However, the Broadway theaters saw much use as Spanish-language movie houses during this time, beginning with the conversion of the [[Million Dollar Theater]] in the 1950s to a Spanish-language theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laconservancy.org/remaining/remaining_theatres08.php4#million |title=Last Remaining Seats |publisher=Laconservancy.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2013, downtown was noted as "a neighborhood with an increasingly [[Hip (slang)|hip]] and [[:wikt:well-heeled|well-heeled]] residential population."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-whole-foods-downtown-20130731,0,2826238.story David Pierson, "Whole Foods to Open Downtown L.A. Store in 2015," ''Los Angeles Times,'' July 31, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the downtown area's office market's migration west to Bunker Hill and the [[Financial District, Los Angeles|Financial District]], many historic office buildings have been left intact, simply used for storage or remaining empty during recent decades. In 1999, the [[Los Angeles City Council]] passed an [[adaptive reuse]] [[Local ordinance|ordinance]], making it easier for developers to convert outmoded, vacant office and commercial buildings into [[loft apartment|renovated lofts]] and luxury apartment and condo complexes.

As of early 2009, 14,561 residential units&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownla.com/pdfs/econ_residential/1Q09HousingBook.pdf|title=Downtown LA - Page not found...|website=www.downtownla.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been created under the adaptive reuse ordinance, leading to an increase in the residential population.  With 28,878 residents in 2006&lt;ref name=DiMassa01&gt;Cara Mia DiMassa, "[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-downtown21feb21,0,4218500.story Downtown L.A. has gained people but lost jobs, report says]", ''Los Angeles Times,'' February 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and 39,537 in 2008,&lt;ref name="downtownla1"&gt;[http://www.downtownla.com/survey/2011/Downtown-LA-Demographic-Study-2011.pdf] DowntownLA.com demographic study&lt;/ref&gt; a 36.9% increase, Downtown Los Angeles is seeing new life and investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-main-street11-2009jun11,0,4047200.story | work=Los Angeles Times | date=2009-06-11 | title=Ordinance brings new life into downtown L.A.'s Main Street}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2009 [[Bottega Louie]] opened on the first floor of the historic [[Brockman Building]] on [[Grand Avenue (Los Angeles)|Grand Avenue]] and Seventh Street. It contributed to the revitalization of DTLA by creating Restaurant Row, which has since brought numerous new restaurants and retail shops to the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ladowntownnews.com/news/the-downtowners-of-distinction/article_1b311095-358e-5d39-ab5b-351f6dcb9c1a.html|title=The Downtowners of Distinction|first=Jon |last=Regardie|date= February 18, 2011|work=[[Los Angeles Downtown News]]|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the upper 11 floors of the Brockman Building were bought with the intention of being sold as luxury lofts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/16/business/la-fi-mo-brockman-lofts-20120413 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Roger | last=Vincent | title=New owners turning Brockman Building into apartments | date=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2000 U.S. census found that just 27,849 residents lived in the 5.84 square miles of downtown—or 4,770 people per square mile, among the lowest densities for the city of Los Angeles but about average for the county. The [[Southern California Association of Governments]] estimates that downtown's daytime population is 207,440.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/neighborhood/downtown/|title=Downtown|website=Mapping L.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population increased to 34,811 by 2008, according to city estimates.

Downtown Los Angeles is almost evenly balanced among the four major racial and ethnic groups — [[Asian Americans]] (23%), [[African Americans]] (22%), [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] (25%) and [[non-Hispanic whites]] (26%) — according to an analysis of 2010 census data made by [[Loyola Marymount University]] researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trounson|first=Rebecca|title=A multicultural moment: Downtown L.A.'s population evenly split|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/multicultural-moment-downtown-la.html|accessdate=April 13, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the 2000 census showed that downtown was the second–most diverse neighborhood in Los Angeles, its [[diversity index]] being 0.743, outrated only by [[Mid-Wilshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/diversity/neighborhood/list/#downtown] "Diversity," Mapping L.A., ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic breakdown in 2000 was [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]], 36.7%; [[African Americans|blacks]], 22.3%; [[Asian Americans|Asians]], 21.3%; [[Non-Hispanic whites|whites]], 16.2%, and others, 3.5%. Mexico (44.7%) and Korea (17%) were the most common places of birth for the 41.9% of the residents who were born abroad, about the same ratio as in the city as a whole.&lt;ref name=MappingLADowntown/&gt;

The median household income in 2008 dollars was $15,003, considered low for both the city and the county. The percentage of households earning $20,000 or less (57.4%) was the highest in Los Angeles County, followed by University Park (56.6%) and Chinatown (53.6%). The average household size of 1.6 people was relatively low. Renters occupied 93.4% of the housing units, and home or apartment owners the rest.&lt;ref name=MappingLADowntown/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/income/20-or-less/neighborhood/list] "$20,000 or less," Mapping L.A., ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, there were 2,400 military veterans living downtown, or 9.7% of the population, considered a high rate for the city but average for the county overall.&lt;ref name=MappingLADowntown/&gt;

In 2013, a study by Downtown Center Business Improvement District showed that of the 52,400 people resided in Downtown Los Angeles. The demographic breakdown was 52.7% Caucasian, 20.1% Asian, 17.0% Latino, and 6.2% African-American; 52.9% female, 47.1% male; and 74.8% of residents were between the ages of 23-44.The median age for residents was 34. The median household income was $98,700. The median household size was 1.8. In terms of educational attainment, 80.1% of residents had completed at least 4 years of college. The study was a self-selecting sample of 8,841 respondents across the DTLA area.

===Local and regional service===
[[File:Los Angeles County Metro Rail and Metro Liner map.svg|thumb|229x229px|Current [[Los Angeles Metro Rail]] map showing rail and rapid transit lines]]
Downtown Los Angeles is the center of the region's growing rail transit system, with six commuter lines operated by [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]], as well as five rapid-transit rail lines and local and regional bus service operated by [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (Metro).

Major Metro stations in the district include [[Los Angeles Union Station]], [[Civic Center/Grand Park station]], [[Pershing Square station]], [[7th Street/Metro Center station]], [[Pico station]], and [[Little Tokyo/Arts District station]].

*The first leg of the modern [[Los Angeles County Metro Rail|Los Angeles Metro Rail system]], the [[Blue Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Blue Line]] light rail, debuted in 1990, followed by the [[Red Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Red Line]] heavy-rail subway line in 1993, the [[Green Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Green Line]] light rail in 1994, the [[Gold Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Gold Line]] light rail in 2003, and the [[Expo Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Expo Line]] light rail in 2012.  
*In late 2009, the [[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Silver Line]] bus rapid transit project opened, replacing two unconnected bus rapid transit lines with through service at street level through the downtown area.
*In 2006, a portion of the Metro Red Line was rebranded by Metro as the [[Purple Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Purple Line]], a heavy-rail subway line which runs from [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]] to [[Wilshire/Western station]] in [[Koreatown, Los Angeles, California|Koreatown]]. A [[Purple Line Extension|westward extension]] of the line to [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]] is currently under construction.
*Metro operates an extensive bus network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.net/riding_metro/maps/default.htm |title=Metro Maps |publisher=Metro.net |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Metro Local, Metro Express commuter lines, and Metro Rapid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.net/projects/rapid/ |title=Metro Rapid |publisher=Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; buses with signal priority and limited stops.

==Skyline==
{{Main|List of tallest buildings in Los Angeles}}
[[File:Los Angeles Skyline.jpg|thumb|220px|The modern skyline of Los Angeles resulted from the termination of severe height restrictions in 1957]]
Despite its relative decentralization and comparatively new high-rises (until 1958, the city did not permit any structures taller than the 27-story City Hall building &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentreader.com/la-city-hall/#Building-City-Hall |title=LA City Hall - Student Reader |publisher=StudentReader.com |date=2012-10-24 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Los Angeles has one of the largest skylines in the [[United States]], and its development has continued in recent years.

The skyline has seen rapid growth due to improvements in seismic design standards, which has made certain building types highly earthquake-resistant. Many of the new skyscrapers contain a housing or hotel component.

Some current and upcoming examples of skyscraper construction include:
*705 Ninth Street, a 35-story residential tower, was completed in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://la.curbed.com/archives/2009/11/it_turns_out_that_rumor.php|title=MerueloMaddux |publisher=MerueloMaddux |date= |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building height limits: 1904-1957===
[[File:LA Eastern Columbia Building.jpg|thumb|The [[Eastern Columbia Building]]: the Entrance to the [[Historic Core, Los Angeles|Historic Core]] and the "Jewel of Downtown"]]
The first height limit ordinance in Los Angeles was enacted following the completion of the 13-story [[Continental Building]], located at the southeast corner of Fourth and Spring streets. The purpose of the height limit was to limit the density of the city. There was great hostility to skyscrapers in many cities in these years, mainly due to the congestion they could bring to the streets, and height limit ordinances were a common way of dealing with the problem. In 1911, the city passed an updated height limit ordinance, establishing a specific limit of {{convert|150|ft|m}}. Exceptions were granted for decorative towers such as those later built on the [[Eastern Columbia Building]] and United Artists Theatre, as well as the now-demolished [[Richfield Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4wilshire.com|title=The Latest On AXS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1911 ordinance was repealed in 1957. The first private building to exceed the old limit was the 18-story United California Bank Building, located at the southeast corner of Sixth and Spring streets.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Flat Roof Ordinance===
The pattern of buildings in Los Angeles to feature these "flat roofs" was the result of a 1974 fire ordinance which required all tall buildings in the city to include rooftop [[helipad]]s in response to the devastating 1974 [[Joelma Fire]] in [[Sao Paulo, Brazil]], in which helicopters were used to affect rescues from the flat rooftop of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Jeremy (January 16, 2012) [http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/columns/laws-that-shaped-la/laws-that-shaped-la-why-is-the-la-skyline-so-bland.html "Laws That Shaped L.A.: Why is the Los Angeles Skyline So Bland?"] [[KCET]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wilshire Grand Center]] was the first building granted an exception by the [[Los Angeles City Fire Department]] in 2014. However, as the building was under construction, [[Los Angeles City Council|L.A. City Council]] removed the flat roof ordinance as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Glick Kudler, Adrian (February 7, 2013) [http://la.curbed.com/archives/2013/02/new_wilshire_grand_will_be_the_west_coasts_tallest_tower.php "New Wilshire Grand Will Be the West Coast's Tallest Tower"] [[Curbed|CURBED Los Angeles]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elliot Sanger''' (March 2, 1897 – July 9, 1989) was the co-founder of [[WQXR-FM]] and an early advocate of [[FM broadcasting]].

==Biography==
Elliott Maxwell Sanger was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Manhattan]] on March 2, 1897.&lt;ref name=NYTObitElliot&gt;{{Cite web|last=  |first=  |authorlink=   |title= Elliott Sanger, a WQXR Founder And FM Radio Pioneer, Dies at 92  |publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=July 10, 1989 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/10/obituaries/elliott-sanger-a-wqxr-founder-and-fm-radio-pioneer-dies-at-92.html  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Townsend Harris High School]] and then the [[Columbia University]] School of Journalism.&lt;ref name=NYTObitElliot /&gt; During [[World War I]], he served as an ensign tasked with selling war bonds before accepting a job as a copywriter at an advertising agency and then as the director of advertising and sales at hosiery manufacturer J.R. Beaton Company.&lt;ref name=NYTObitElliot /&gt; In 1936, Sanger co-founded a small 250 watt radio station [[WQXR-FM]] (originally the Interstate Broadcasting Company) above a garage in [[Long Island City]] with [[John Vincent Lawless Hogan]] whom he shared a love for classical music with the belief that high quality, high fidelity, live music would eventually attract advertisers.&lt;ref name=NYTObitElliot /&gt; As an early advocate of the clarity and high fidelity of [[FM broadcasting]], WQXR became the first FM station in New York City and the first nationally to present a regularly scheduled FM program.&lt;ref name=NYTObitElliot /&gt; In order to maintain its semblance of decorum, the station prohibited "singing jingles and raucous sound effects."&lt;ref name=NYTObitElliot /&gt; In 1944, WQXR [[The New York Times]] bought the station.&lt;ref name=NYTObitElliot /&gt; Sanger served as executive vice president and general manager of WQXR from its founding until 1965 and chairman until 1967 when he retired.&lt;ref name=NYTObitElliot /&gt;

Sanger documented his story in the 1973 book, ''Rebel in Radio: The Story of WQXR,'' published by Hastings House.&lt;ref name=NYTObitElliot /&gt;

==Personal life==
Sanger was married to Eleanor Naumburg, grandniece of [[Elkan Naumburg]]; they had two sons, Elliott Sanger Jr. and Kenneth E.

'''Elysium Health''' is a company founded in 2014 by [[biologist]] [[Leonard Guarente]], Dan Alminana, and Eric Marcotulli to market [[dietary supplement]]s.&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt;  The next year, the company started selling a dietary supplement called Basis that packages two supplements, [[nicotinamide riboside]] (NR), a form of B vitamin found in yeast, and [[pterostilbene]], a polyphenol found in blueberries, into one capsule.&lt;ref name=Tech&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weintraub|first1=Karen|title=The anti-aging pill|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/534636/the-anti-aging-pill/|accessdate=5 February 2015|date=February 3, 2015|publisher=MIT Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company says that these two ingredients help cells make [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD) and that they stimulate [[sirtuins]].&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt;  The company is widely described as being in the [[anti-aging]] field and similar to [[Sirtris Pharmaceuticals]] which was developing [[resveratrol]].&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tech/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stipp|first1=David|title=Beyond resveratrol: the anti-aging NAD fad|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/beyond-resveratrol-the-anti-aging-nad-fad/|work=Scientific American Blog|date=March 11, 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elysium has tried to [[Product differentiation|differentiate]] the product within the dietary supplement industry as being more scientific and exclusive, by means of the product's minimalist packaging, by not selling the product in drug stores but rather only through its website, and by getting several Nobel prize winners to join its scientific advisory board.&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;&lt;ref name=criticsblast&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weintraub|first1=Karen|title=Critics blast star-studded advisory board of anti-aging company|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603199/critics-blast-star-studded-advisory-board-of-anti-aging-company/|work=MIT Technology Review|date=January 6, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clinicaltrial&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vinluan|first1=Frank|title=First clinical trial done, Elysium lands $20M for health supplements |url=https://www.xconomy.com/new-york/2016/12/06/first-clinical-trial-done-elysium-lands-20m-for-health-supplements/?single_page=true|work=Xconomy|date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has been criticized for using this advisory board to lend credibility to its product.&lt;ref name=criticsblast/&gt; Like other companies in the supplement industry, Elysium marketed the product heavily on social media.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Benjamin|title=An MIT scientist claims that this pill is the fountain of youth|url=https://www.thecut.com/2016/08/is-elysium-healths-basis-the-fountain-of-youth.html|work=New York Magazine|language=en|date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zhang|first1=Sarah|title=The weird business behind a trendy "anti-aging" pill|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/07/confused-elysiums-anti-aging-drug-yeah-fda/|work=Wired|date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elysium originally bought the ingredients in Basis from [[ChromaDex]], which as of December 2016, sold the two ingredients to other supplement companies that also marketed products containing them.&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lowe|first1=Derek|title=Subtle changes can be yours, for fifty dollars a month |url=http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/04/25/subtle-changes-can-be-yours-for-fifty-dollars-a-month|work=In the Pipeline|date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Crunch2016/&gt; The two companies had an agreement under which Elysium Health didn't have to acknowledge ChromaDex as the source of the ingredients, but then after Elysium recruited the head of business development from Chromadex and allegedly stopped paying Chromadex, Chromadex sued Elysium and the information became public.&lt;ref name=TC&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buhr|first1=Sarah|title=A new lawsuit alleges anti-aging startup Elysium Health hasn’t paid its sole supplier|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/16/a-new-lawsuit-alleges-anti-aging-startup-elysium-health-hasnt-paid-its-supplier-and-is-in-breach-of-agreement/|work=TechCrunch|date=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deathmatch/&gt; In September 2018, [[Dartmouth College]] and ChromaDex sued Elysium for infringement of two issued patents&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Nicotinamide riboside kinase compositions and methods for using the same|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US8197807B2/en|date=2006-04-20|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Nicotinamide riboside kinase compositions and methods for using the same|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US8383086B2/en|date=2012-04-12|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; exclusively licensed by ChromaDex on use of NR to increase NAD that were invented by [[Charles Brenner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/chromadex-and-dartmouth-college-file-patent-infringement-lawsuit-against-elysium-health-20180918-00254|title=ChromaDex and Dartmouth College File Patent Infringement Lawsuit Against Elysium Health - NASDAQ.com|work=NASDAQ.com|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entrepreneurship''' is the process of designing, launching and running a new business, which is often initially a [[small business]]. The people who create these businesses are called '''entrepreneurs'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=AK Yetisen|author2=LR Volpatti|author3=AF Coskun|author4=S Cho|author5=E Kamrani|author6=H Butt|author7=A Khademhos\\seini|author8=SH Yun|title=Entrepreneurship|journal=Lab Chip|volume=15|issue=18|pages=3638–3660|doi=10.1039/c5lc00577a|pmid=26245815|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/lc/c5lc00577a|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref name="moves"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Riitta|last1=Katila|first2=Eric L.|last2=Chen|first3=Henning|last3=Piezunka|title=All the right moves: How entrepreneurial firms compete effectively|journal=Strategic Entrepreneurship Jnl|date=7 June 2012|volume=6|issue=2|doi=10.1002/sej.1130|url=http://web.stanford.edu/~rkatila/new/pdf/KatilaSEJ12.pdf|accessdate=18 May 2017|pages=116–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurship has been described as the "capacity and willingness to develop, organize and manage a business venture along with any of its risks in order to make a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]".&lt;ref name="businessdictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/entrepreneurship.html#ixzz3xv9ci0nt|title=Business Dictionary definition|publisher=Business Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; While definitions of entrepreneurship typically focus on the launching and running of businesses, due to the high risks involved in launching a start-up, a significant proportion of start-up businesses have to close due to "lack of funding, bad business decisions, an economic crisis, lack of market demand—or a combination of all of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/224113|title=How to Properly Close Your Business|first=Mikal E.|last=Belicove|date=2 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broader definition of the term is sometimes used, especially in the field of [[economics]]. In this usage, an Entrepreneur is an entity which has the ability to find and act upon opportunities to translate inventions or technology into new products: "The entrepreneur is able to recognize the commercial potential of the invention and organize the capital, talent, and other resources that turn an invention into a commercially viable innovation." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Economics of Science and Technology|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|volume=27|issue=2|page=157|doi=10.1023/A:1014382532639|year=2002|last1 = Audretsch|first1 = David B.|last2=Bozeman|first2=Barry|last3=Combs|first3=Kathryn L.|last4=Feldman|first4=Maryann|last5=Link|first5=Albert N.|last6=Siegel|first6=Donald S.|last7=Stephan|first7=Paula|last8=Tassey|first8=Gregory|last9=Wessner|first9=Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the term "Entrepreneurship" also captures innovative activities on the part of established firms, in addition to similar activities on the part of new businesses.

== Elements ==
Entrepreneurship is the act of being an [[entrepreneur]], or "the owner or manager of a business enterprise who, by risk and initiative, attempts to make profits".&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|entrepreneur|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurs act as managers and oversee the launch and growth of an enterprise. Entrepreneurship is the process by which either an individual or a team identifies a business opportunity and acquires and deploys the necessary resources required for its exploitation. Early-19th-century French economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] provided a broad definition of entrepreneurship, saying that it "shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield". Entrepreneurs create something new, something different—they change or transmute values.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, P. F. (1993). ''Innovation and entrepreneurship: practice and principles''. New York: HarperBusiness.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the firm size, big or small, they can partake in entrepreneurship opportunities. The opportunity to become an entrepreneur requires four criteria. First, there must be opportunities or situations to recombine resources to generate profit. Second, entrepreneurship requires differences between people, such as preferential access to certain individuals or the ability to recognize information about opportunities. Third, taking on risk is a necessary. Fourth, the entrepreneurial process requires the organization of people and resources.&lt;ref name="Shane"&gt;Shane, S. A. (2003).

The entrepreneur is a factor in and the study of entrepreneurship reaches back to the work of [[Richard Cantillon]] and [[Adam Smith]] in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. However, entrepreneurship was largely ignored theoretically until the late 19th and early 20th centuries and empirically until a profound resurgence in business and economics since the late 1970s. In the 20th century, the understanding of entrepreneurship owes much to the work of economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other Austrian economists such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is a person who is willing and able to convert a new idea or invention into a successful innovation. Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called "the gale of creative destruction" to replace in whole or in part inferior innovations across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products including new business models. In this way, creative destruction is largely responsible for the dynamism of industries and long-run economic growth. The supposition that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in endogenous growth theory and as such is hotly debated in academic economics. An alternative description posited by Israel Kirzner suggests that the majority of innovations may be much more incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the making of drinking straws.

The exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities may include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert D.|last=Hisrich|title=Entrepreneurship|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=s01P0agnLPUC}}|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07062-017-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Developing a [[business plan]]
* Hiring the [[human resources]]
* Acquiring financial and material resources
* Providing leadership
* Being responsible for both the venture's success or failure
* [[Risk aversion]]

Economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883–1950) saw the role of the entrepreneur in the economy as "[[creative destruction]]" – launching innovations that simultaneously destroy old industries while ushering in new industries and approaches. For Schumpeter, the changes and "dynamic [[Economic equilibrium#Disequilibrium|disequilibrium]] brought on by the innovating entrepreneur [were] the norm of a healthy [[economy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/provincial/innovation/ambition.aspx|title= Entrepreneurial Ambition - Innovation Provincial Rankings - How Canada Performs|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While entrepreneurship is often associated with new, small, for-profit start-ups, entrepreneurial behavior can be seen in small-, medium- and large-sized firms, new and established firms and in for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, including voluntary-sector groups, [[charitable organization]]s and [[Civil service|government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Clifford|first1= Catherine|title= Why everyone will have to become an entrepreneur|url= https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/228176|website= entrepreneur.com|accessdate= 8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurship may operate within an [[entrepreneurship ecosystem]] which often includes:
* Government programs and services that promote entrepreneurship and support entrepreneurs and start-ups
* Non-governmental organizations such as small-business associations and organizations that offer advice and mentoring to entrepreneurs (e.g. through entrepreneurship centers or websites)
* Small-business [[advocacy organization]]s that lobby governments for increased support for entrepreneurship programs and more small business-friendly laws and regulations
* Entrepreneurship resources and facilities (e.g. [[business incubator]]s and [[seed accelerator]]s)
* Entrepreneurship education and training programs offered by schools, colleges and universities
* Financing (e.g. bank loans, [[venture capital financing]], [[angel investing]] and government and private foundation grants)&lt;ref name=VentureCapitalNY1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nvca.org/research/venture-investment/|title=Venture Investment - Regional Aggregate Data|publisher=National Venture Capital Association and PricewaterhouseCoopers|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=July 2017}}

In the 2000s, usage of the term "entrepreneurship" expanded to include how and why some individuals (or teams) identify opportunities, evaluate them as viable, and then decide to exploit them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=S.|last2=Venkatraman|first2=S.|date=2000|title=The promise of entrepreneurship as a field of research|journal=Academy of Management Review|volume=25|pages=217–226|doi=10.5465/amr.2000.2791611}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been used to discuss how people might use these opportunities to develop new products or services, launch new firms or industries, and create [[wealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brush|first1=C.|display-authors=etal|year=2003|title=Doctoral education in the field of entrepreneurship|journal=Journal of Management|volume=29|issue=3|pages=309–331|doi=10.1016/s0149-2063(03)00014-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entrepreneurial process is uncertain because opportunities can only be identified after they have been exploited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramoglou|first1=S.|last2=Tsang|first2=E.W.K.|display-authors=etal|year=2016|title=A realist perspective of entrepreneurship: Opportunities as propensities|journal=Academy of Management Review|volume=41|issue=3|pages=409–434|doi=10.5465/amr.2014.0281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurs tend exhibit positive [[biases]] towards finding new possibilities and seeing unmet market needs, and a tendency towards risk-taking that makes them more likely to exploit [[Business opportunity|business opportunities]].&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S.X.

Cantillon considered the entrepreneur to be a risk taker who deliberately allocates resources to exploit opportunities in order to maximize the financial return.&lt;ref name="Cantillon, R. 1931"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cantillon |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Cantillon |year=1755 |title=Essai sur la nature du commerce en général |location=London |publisher=MacMillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevenson |first1=H. |last2=Jarillo |first2=J. |title=A Paradigm of Entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurial Management, in |editor1-first=Álvaro |editor1-last=Cuervo|editor2-first=Domingo |editor2-last=Ribeiro|editor3-first=Salvador |editor3-last=Roig|work=Entrepreneurship: Concepts, Theory and Perspective|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2v-aWpdgoPQC |pg=5}}|date=26 May 2007|publisher=Springer Science Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-48543-8|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantillon emphasized the willingness of the entrepreneur to assume the risk and to deal with uncertainty, thus he drew attention to the function of the entrepreneur and distinguished between the function of the entrepreneur and the owner who provided the money.&lt;ref name="Cantillon, R. 1931"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Landström, H. 2005"&gt;• Landström, H. &amp; SpringerLink 2005, Pioneers in entrepreneurship and small business research, Springer Science+Business Media, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Baptiste Say also identified entrepreneurs as a driver for economic development, emphasizing their role as one of the collecting factors of production allocating resources from less to fields that are more productive. Both Say and Cantillon belonged to French school of thought and known as the physiocrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enterprise: Entrepreneurship and Innovation|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7506-6920-7|location=|pages=5|last1=Lowe|first1=Robin|last2=Marriott|first2=Sue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dating back to the time of the medieval [[guilds]] in Germany, a [[craftspeople|craftsperson]] required special permission to operate as an entrepreneur, the small proof of competence (''Kleiner Befähigungsnachweis''), which restricted training of apprentices to craftspeople who held a [[Meister]] certificate. This institution was introduced in 1908 after a period of so-called freedom of trade (''Gewerbefreiheit'', introduced in 1871) in the [[German Reich]]. However, proof of competence was not required to start a business. In 1935 and in 1953, greater proof of competence was reintroduced (''Großer Befähigungsnachweis Kuhlenbeck''), which required craftspeople to obtain a [[Meister]] apprentice-training certificate before being permitted to set up a new business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s00181-013-0773-7|title = Entry regulation and entrepreneurship: A natural experiment in German craftsmanship| journal=Empirical Economics| volume=47| issue=3| pages=1067–1101|year = 2013|last1 = Rostam-Afschar|first1 = Davud}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
In the 20th century, entrepreneurship was studied by [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other [[Austrian school|Austrian economists]] such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. While the loan from French of the word "entrepreneur" dates to the 1850, the term "entrepreneurship" was coined around the 1920s. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is willing and able to convert a new idea or [[invention]] into a successful innovation.&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1976"&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter|title=Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=6eM6YrMj46sC}}|year=1976|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-10762-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called "the gale of [[creative destruction]]" to replace in whole or in part inferior offerings across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products and new [[business model]]s, thus creative destruction is largely responsible for long-term [[economic growth]]. The idea that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in [[endogenous growth theory]]{{clarify|date=October 2013}} and as such continues to be debated in academic economics. An alternative description by [[Israel Kirzner]] suggests that the majority of innovations may be incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the construction of a drinking straw that require no special qualities.

For Schumpeter, entrepreneurship resulted in new industries and in new combinations of currently existing inputs. Schumpeter's initial example of this was the combination of a steam engine and then current wagon making technologies to produce the horseless carriage. In this case, the innovation (i.e. the car) was transformational, but did not require the development of dramatic new technology. It did not immediately replace the horse-drawn carriage, but in time incremental improvements reduced the cost and improved the technology, leading to the modern auto industry. Despite Schumpeter's early 20th-century contributions, the traditional [[microeconomic]] theory did not formally consider the entrepreneur in its theoretical frameworks (instead of assuming that resources would find each other through a price system). In this treatment, the entrepreneur was an implied but unspecified actor, consistent with the concept of the entrepreneur being the agent of [[x-efficiency]].

For Schumpeter, the entrepreneur did not bear risk: the capitalist did. Schumpeter believed that the equilibrium was imperfect. Schumpeter (1934) demonstrated that the changing environment continuously provides new information about the optimum allocation of resources to enhance profitability. Some individuals acquire the new information before others and recombine the resources to gain an entrepreneurial profit. Schumpeter was of the opinion that entrepreneurs shift the [[Production–possibility frontier|production possibility curve]] to a higher level using innovations.&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1934"&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter |authorlink=Joseph Schumpeter |title=The Theory of Economic Development: An Inquiry Into Profits, Capital, Credit, Interest, and the Business Cycle|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-OZwWcOGeOwC}}|year=1934|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-87855-698-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, economists made the first attempt to study the entrepreneurship concept in depth.&lt;ref name="Landstrom2007"&gt;{{cite book|first=H.|last=Landstrom|title=Pioneers in Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=oSjccQt5zTsC}}|date=31 December 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-23633-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred Marshall viewed the entrepreneur as a multi-tasking capitalist and observed that in the equilibrium of a completely competitive market there was no spot for "entrepreneurs" as an economic activity creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Alfred|last1=Marshall|author1-link=Alfred Marshall|first2=C.

In the 2000s, entrepreneurship has been extended from its origins in for-profit businesses to include [[social entrepreneurship]], in which business goals are sought alongside social, environmental or humanitarian goals and even the concept of the [[political entrepreneur]].{{according to whom|date=August 2013}} Entrepreneurship within an existing firm or large organization has been referred to as [[intrapreneurship]] and may include corporate ventures where large entities "spin-off" subsidiary organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Scott Andrew |last=Shane |title=A General Theory of Entrepreneurship: The Individual-opportunity Nexus|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0FxO_Wsh30kC}}|year=2000|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-78100-799-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurs are leaders willing to take risk and exercise initiative, taking advantage of market opportunities by planning, organizing and deploying resources,{{sfn|Deakins|Freel|2009}} often by innovating to create new or improving existing products or services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Johnson, D.

According to Paul Reynolds, founder of the [[Global Entrepreneurship Monitor]], "by the time they reach their retirement years, half of all working men in the United States probably have a period of self-employment of one or more years; one in four may have engaged in self-employment for six or more years. Participating in a new business creation is a common activity among U.S. workers over the course of their careers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paul D.

Entrepreneurial activities differ substantially depending on the type of organization and creativity involved. Entrepreneurship ranges in scale from solo, part-time projects to large-scale undertakings that involve a team and which may create many jobs. Many "high value" entrepreneurial ventures seek [[venture capital]] or [[angel investor|angel funding]] ([[seed money]]) in order to raise [[capital (economics)|capital]] for building and expanding the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mark Van Osnabrugge |author2=Robert J. Robinson |title=Angel Investing |year=2000 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-7879-5202-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many organizations exist to support would-be entrepreneurs, including specialized government agencies, [[business incubator]]s (which may be for-profit, non-profit, or operated by a college or university), [[science park]]s and [[non-governmental organization]]s, which include a range of organizations including not-for-profits, charities, foundations and business advocacy groups (e.g. [[Chamber of commerce|Chambers of commerce]]). Beginning in 2008, an annual "[[Global Entrepreneurship Week]]" event aimed at "exposing people to the benefits of entrepreneurship" and getting them to "participate in entrepreneurial-related activities" was launched.{{who|date=October 2013}}

=== Relationship between small business and entrepreneurship ===
The term "entrepreneur" is often conflated with the term "[[small business]]" or used interchangeably with this term. While most entrepreneurial ventures start out as a small business, not all small businesses are entrepreneurial in the strict sense of the term. Many small businesses are sole proprietor operations consisting solely of the owner—or they have a small number of employees—and many of these small businesses offer an existing product, process or service and they do not aim at growth. In contrast, entrepreneurial ventures offer an innovative product, process or service and the entrepreneur typically aims to scale up the company by adding employees, seeking international sales and so on, a process which is financed by [[venture capital]] and [[Angel investor|angel investment]]s. In this way, the term "entrepreneur" may be more closely associated with the term "[[Startup company|startup]]". Successful entrepreneurs have the ability to lead a business in a positive direction by proper planning, to adapt to changing environments and understand their own strengths and weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://www.ondernemerstest.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ICSBv5.pdf|first1=Martyn P. |last1=Driessen |first2=Peter S. |last2=Zwart|title=The role of the entrepreneur in small business success: the  Entrepreneurship Scan|year= 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of entrepreneurs==
=== Ethnic ===
The term "ethnic entrepreneurship" refers to self-employed business owners who belong to racial or [[ethnic minority]] groups in the United States and Europe. A long tradition of academic research explores the experiences and strategies of ethnic entrepreneurs as they strive to integrate economically into mainstream U.S. or European society. Classic cases include Jewish merchants and tradespeople in large U.S. cities in the 19th and early 20th centuries as well as Chinese and Japanese small business owners (restaurants, farmers, shop owners) on the West Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Out Of Print : Ethnic Enterprise in America: Business and Welfare Among Chinese, Japanese, and Blacks : Ivan Light - University of California Press|url = http://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520024854|website = www.ucpress.edu|access-date = 2016-01-16|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161020162025/http://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520024854|archivedate = 2016-10-20|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, ethnic entrepreneurship has been studied in the case of Cuban business owners in Miami, Indian motel owners of the U.S. and Chinese business owners in [[Chinatown]]s across the United States. While entrepreneurship offers these groups many opportunities for economic advancement, self-employment and business ownership in the United States remain unevenly distributed along racial/ethnic lines.&lt;ref name="Chaudhary 318–354"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Racialized Incorporation: The Effects of Race and Generational Status on Self-Employment and Industry-Sector Prestige in the United States|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/imre.12087/abstract|journal = International Migration Review|date = 2015-06-01|issn = 1747-7379|pages = 318–354|volume = 49|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/imre.12087|first = Ali R.|last = Chaudhary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous success stories of Asian entrepreneurs, a recent statistical analysis of U.S. census data shows that whites are more likely than Asians, African-Americans and Latinos to be self-employed in high prestige, lucrative industries.&lt;ref name="Chaudhary 318–354"/&gt;

=== Institutional ===
The American-born British economist [[Edith Penrose]] has highlighted the collective nature of entrepreneurship. She mentions that in modern organizations, human resources need to be combined in order to better capture and create business opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, Edith T. (1959). The Theory of the Growth of the Firm. New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist [[Paul DiMaggio]] (1988:14) has expanded this view to say that "new institutions arise when organized actors with sufficient resources [institutional entrepreneurs] see in them an opportunity to realize interests that they value highly".&lt;ref&gt;DiMaggio, P. 1988 'Interest and agency in institutional theory'.

=== Cultural ===
According to Christopher Rea and Nicolai Volland, cultural entrepreneurship is "practices of individual and collective agency characterized by mobility between cultural professions and modes of cultural production", which refers to creative industry activities and sectors. In their book ''[https://www.ubcpress.ca/the-business-of-culture The Business of Culture]'' (2015), Rea and Volland identify three types of cultural entrepreneur: "cultural personalities", defined as "individuals who buil[d] their own personal brand of creativity as a cultural authority and leverage it to create and sustain various cultural enterprises"; "tycoons", defined as "entrepreneurs who buil[d] substantial clout in the cultural sphere by forging synergies between their industrial, cultural, political, and philanthropic interests"; and "collective enterprises", organizations which may engage in cultural production for profit or not-for-profit purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Rea and Nicolai Volland, "The Business of Culture" (UBC Press, 2015), pp. 4-7. (See also pp. 9-31: "Enter the Cultural Entrepreneur")&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist===

{{Main|Social entrepreneurship}}
Social entrepreneurship is the use of the by [[Startup company|start up companies]] and other [[entrepreneur]]s to develop, fund and implement solutions to social, cultural, or environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150811030258/https://www.pbs.org/opb/thenewheroes/whatis/ ''The New Heros''], What is Social Entrepreneurship, Oregon Public Broadcasting, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This concept may be applied to a variety of organizations with different sizes, aims, and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;"The Meaning of Social Entrepreneurship," J. Gregory Dees, 1998, rev 2001 {{cite web | publisher=caseatduke.org | title=The Meaning of Social Entrepreneurship | url=http://caseatduke.org/ | accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; For-profit entrepreneurs typically measure performance using business metrics like [[Profit (economics)|profit]], [[revenues]] and increases in [[stock price]]s, but social entrepreneurs are either [[non-profit organization|non-profits]] or blend for-profit goals with generating a positive "return to society" and therefore must use different metrics. Social entrepreneurship typically attempts to further broad social, cultural, and environmental goals often associated with the [[voluntary sector]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = J.L. | year = 2002 | title = The World of the Social Entrepreneur | url = | journal = The International Journal of Public Sector Management | volume = 15 | issue = 4/5| page = 413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in areas such as poverty alleviation, [[health care]] and [[community development]]. At times, profit-making [[social enterprise]]s may be established to support the social or cultural goals of the organization but not as an end in itself. For example, an organization that aims to provide housing and employment to the [[homelessness|homeless]] may operate a [[restaurant]], both to raise money and to provide employment for the homeless people.

===Nascent===
A nascent [[entrepreneur]] is someone in the process of establishing a business venture.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, P. D. and White, S. (1997). The Entrepreneurial Process. Westport, CT: Quorum Books.&lt;/ref&gt; In this observation, the nascent entrepreneur can be seen as pursuing an [[Business opportunity|opportunity]], i.e. a possibility to introduce new services or products, serve new markets, or develop more efficient production methods in a profitable manner.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, M., 1982. The entrepreneur: An economic theory. Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shane, S. and Venkataraman, S. (2000). ‘The promise of entrepreneurship as a field of research’. Academy of Management Review, 25, 217–26.&lt;/ref&gt; But before such a venture is actually established, the opportunity is just a venture idea.&lt;ref&gt;Davidsson, P. (2006). ‘Nascent entrepreneurship: empirical studies and developments’. Foundations and Trends in Entrepreneurship, 2, 1–76.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the pursued opportunity is perceptual in nature, propped by the nascent entrepreneur's personal beliefs about the feasibility of the venturing outcomes the nascent entrepreneur seeks to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;Dimov, D. (2007b). ‘Beyond the single-person, single-insight attribution in understanding entrepreneurial opportunities’. Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 31, 713–31. ‘From opportunity insight to opportunity intention: the importance of person-situation learning match’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice|volume= 31|pages = 561–583|last = Dimov|first = Dimo|title = From Opportunity Insight to Opportunity Intention: The Importance of Person-Situation Learning Match|issue= 4|date = July 2007|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6520.2007.00188.x |ssrn=999462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, D. A., McMullen, J. S. and Jennings, P. D. (2007). ‘The formation of opportunity beliefs: overcoming ignorance and reducing doubt’. Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 1, 75–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Its prescience and value cannot be confirmed ex ante but only gradually, in the context of the actions that the nascent entrepreneur undertakes towards establishing the venture,&lt;ref&gt;Sarasvathy, S. D. (2001). ‘Causation and effectuation: toward a theoretical shift from economic inevitability to entrepreneurial contingency’. Academy of Management Review, 26, 243–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, these actions can lead to a path that the nascent entrepreneur deems no longer attractive or feasible, or result in the emergence of a (viable) business. In this sense, over time, the nascent venture can move towards being discontinued or towards emerging successfully as an operating entity.

The distinction between the novice, serial and portfolio entrepreneurs is an example of behavior-based categorization.&lt;ref&gt;Ucbasaran, D., Westhead, P. and Wright, M., 2009. The extent and nature of opportunity identification by experienced entrepreneurs. Journal of business venturing, 24(2), pp.99-115.

Journal of Business Venturing, 22(2), 236–261.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the solitary act of exploiting an opportunity. Such research will help separate entrepreneurial action into its basic sub-activities and elucidate the inter- relationships between activities, between an activity (or sequence of activities) and an individual's motivation to form an opportunity belief, and between an activity (or sequence of activities) and the knowledge needed to form an opportunity belief. With this research, scholars will be able to begin constructing a theory of the micro-foundations of entrepreneurial action.

Scholars interested in nascent entrepreneurship tend to focus less on the single act of opportunity exploitation and more on the series of actions in new venture emergence,&lt;ref name="Delmar, F 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim, P.H., Longest, K.C. and Lippmann, S., 2015. The tortoise versus the hare: Progress and business viability differences between conventional and leisure-based founders. Journal of Business Venturing, 30(2), pp.185-204.&lt;/ref&gt;,.&lt;ref name="Lichtenstein, B. B. 2007"/&gt; Indeed, nascent entrepreneurs undertake numerous [[entrepreneurial]] activities, including actions that make their businesses more concrete to themselves and others. For instance, nascent entrepreneurs often look for and purchase facilities and equipment; seek and obtain financial backing, form [[legal entities]], organize teams; and dedicate all their time and energy to their business&lt;ref&gt;Carter, N.M., Gartner, W.B. and Reynolds, P.D., 1996. Exploring start-up event sequences. Journal of business venturing, 11(3), pp.151-166.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project-based ===
Project entrepreneurs are individuals who are engaged in the repeated assembly or creation of temporary organizations.&lt;ref name="Ferriani2009"&gt;Ferriani, S., Cattani, G., C. Baden-Fuller (2009) "The Relational Antecedents of Project-Entrepreneurship: Network Centrality, Team Composition, and Project Performance", Research Policy, 2009, 38 (10): 1545–1558.[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByE7rCUuloTlM1NabFZra1RiUDg/edit?usp=sharing]&lt;/ref&gt; These are organizations that have limited lifespans which are devoted to producing a singular objective or goal and get disbanded rapidly when the project ends. Industries where project-based enterprises are widespread include: [[sound recording]], [[film production]], [[software development]], television production, [[new media]] and construction.&lt;ref name="Faulkner1987"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Faulkner | first1 = R. R. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = A. B. | year = 1987 | title = Short-term projects and emergent careers: evidence from Hollywood | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 92 | issue = 4| pages = 879–909 | doi=10.1086/228586}}&lt;/ref&gt; What makes project-entrepreneurs distinctive from a theoretical standpoint is that they have to "rewire" these temporary ventures and modify them to suit the needs of new project opportunities that emerge. A project entrepreneur who used a certain approach and team for one project may have to modify the business model or team for a subsequent project.

Project entrepreneurs are exposed repeatedly to problems and tasks typical of the entrepreneurial process.&lt;ref name="DeFillippi2004"&gt;DeFillippi, R., &amp; Spring, S. 2004 Project entrepreneurs for project-based enterprises: Extension or complement to project management competencies? Projects and Profits, 4(2): 50-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, project-entrepreneurs face two critical challenges that invariably characterize the creation of a new venture: locating the right opportunity to launch the project venture and assembling the most appropriate team to exploit that opportunity. Resolving the first challenge requires project-entrepreneurs to access an extensive range of information needed to seize new investment opportunities. Resolving the second challenge requires assembling a collaborative team that has to fit well with the particular challenges of the project and has to function almost immediately to reduce the risk that performance might be adversely affected. Another type of project entrepreneurship involves entrepreneurs working with business students to get analytical work done on their ideas.

=== Millennial ===
The term "millennial entrepreneur" refers to a business owner who is affiliated with the generation that was brought up using digital technology and mass media—the products of [[Baby Boomers]], those people born during the 1980s and early 1990s. Also known as [[Generation Y]], these business owners are well equipped with knowledge of new technology and new business models and have a strong grasp of its business applications. There have been many breakthrough businesses that have come from millennial entrepreneurs such as [[Mark Zuckerberg]], who created [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/the-richest-millennial-entrepreneurs-in-america.htm.html|title=The 10 Richest Millennial Entrepreneurs in America|last=|first=|date=December 12, 2016|work=Inc.com|access-date=June 6, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the expectation of millennial success, there have been recent studies that have proven this to not be the case.  The comparison between millennials who are self-employed and those who are not self-employed shows that the latter is higher. The reason for this is because they have grown up in a different generation and attitude than their elders. Some of the barriers to entry for entrepreneurs are the economy, debt from schooling and the challenges of regulatory compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/Millenial_IB.pdf|title=The Missing Millennial Entrepreneurs|last=Wilmouth|first=Daniel|date=|website=U.S. Small Business Administration|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entrepreneurial behaviors ==
The entrepreneur is commonly seen as an innovator—a designer of new ideas and business processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp ''Investopedia'']; Investopedia.com; access date.&lt;/ref&gt; Management skills and strong team building abilities are often perceived as essential leadership attributes for successful entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaprive/2012/12/19/top-10-qualities-that-make-a-great-leader | title=Top 10 Qualities That Make A Great Leader | first=Tanya | last=Prive | work=[[Forbes]] | date=19 December 2012 | accessdate=1 August 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020062832/https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaprive/2012/12/19/top-10-qualities-that-make-a-great-leader | archivedate = 10 October 2017 | deadurl = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political economist [[Robert Reich]] considers leadership, management ability and [[team-building]] to be essential qualities of an entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Richard | last=Cantillon | title=Essai sur la Nature du Commerce en Général | year=1755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Peter F. | last=Drucker | title=Innovation and Entrepreneurship | year=1985}} attributes the coining and defining of "entrepreneur" to Jean-Baptiste Say in his ''A Treatise on Political Economy''; (1834).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uncertainty perception and risk-taking ===

Theorists [[Frank Knight]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank Hyneman |last=Knight |authorlink=Frank H. Knight |title=Risk, Uncertainty and Profit|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-alYLsfnCXUC}}|year=2005|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=978-1-59605-242-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Drucker]] defined entrepreneurship in terms of risk-taking. The entrepreneur is willing to put his or her career and financial security on the line and take risks in the name of an idea, spending time as well as capital on an uncertain venture. However, entrepreneurs often do not believe that they have taken an enormous amount of risks because they do not perceive the level of uncertainty to be as high as other people do. Knight classified three types of uncertainty:
* [[Risk]], which is measurable statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red color ball from a jar containing five red balls and five white balls)
* [[Ambiguity]], which is hard to measure statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar containing five red balls but an unknown number of white balls)
* [[Uncertainty|True uncertainty]] or Knightian uncertainty, which is impossible to estimate or predict statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar whose contents, in terms of numbers of coloured balls, are entirely unknown)

[[File:Malala Yousafzai 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Malala Yousafzai]], a Pakistani activist, social entrepreneur and youngest-ever [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner]]
Entrepreneurship is often associated with true uncertainty, particularly when it involves the creation of a novel good or service, for a market that did not previously exist, rather than when a venture creates an incremental improvement to an existing product or service. A 2014 study at ETH Zürich found that compared with typical managers, entrepreneurs showed higher decision-making efficiency and a stronger activation in regions of frontopolar cortex (FPC) previously associated with explorative choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laureiro-Martínez|first1=Daniella|last2=Canessa|first2=Nicola|last3=Brusoni|first3=Stefano|last4=Zollo|first4=Maurizio|last5=Hare|first5=Todd|last6=Alemanno|first6=Federica|last7=Cappa|first7=Stefano F.|title=Frontopolar cortex and decision-making efficiency: comparing brain activity of experts with different professional background during an exploration-exploitation task|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=22 January 2014|volume=7|page=927|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00927|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00927/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Coachability" and advice taking ===
The ability of entrepreneurs to work closely with and take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e. their coachability) has long been considered a critical factor in entrepreneurial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Timmons|first=Jeffry A.|last2=Bygrave|first2=William D.|title=Venture capital's role in financing innovation for economic growth|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=1|issue=2|pages=161–176|doi=10.1016/0883-9026(86)90012-1|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when that advice comes from well-informed sources, because entrepreneurs possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of coachability are not actually predictive of entrepreneurial success (e.g. measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots and firm survival). This research also shows that older and larger founding teams, presumably those with more subject expertise, are less coachable than younger and smaller founding teams.

===Strategies===
Strategies that entrepreneurs may use include:
* [[Innovation]] of new products, services or processes&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Qureshi|first1=Hamid|title=Decoding Right Strategies for Entrepreneurship|url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/opinion/decoding-right-strategies-for-entrepreneurship/195820.html|accessdate=30 March 2016|work=Greater Kashmir|date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Continuous process improvement (CPI)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Exploration of new business models
* Use of technology&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Use of [[business intelligence]]
* Use of economical strategics
* Development of future products and services&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Optimized talent management&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Designing individual/opportunity nexus ===
According to Shane and Venkataraman, entrepreneurship comprises both "enterprising individuals" and "entrepreneurial opportunities", so researchers should study the nature of the individuals who identify opportunities when others do not, the opportunities themselves and the nexus between individuals and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2000.2791611 | title=THE PROMISE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A FIELD OF RESEARCH. | journal=Academy of Management Review | date=2000 | volume=25 | issue=1 | pages=217–226 | first=S. | last=Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Reynolds et al.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds PD, Hay M, Bygrave WD et al. (2002) Global Entrepreneurship Monitor: 2002 Global Executive Report. Kansas City, MO: Kauffman Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that individuals are motivated to engage in entrepreneurial endeavors driven mainly by necessity or opportunity, that is individuals pursue entrepreneurship primarily owing to survival needs, or because they identify business opportunities that satisfy their need for achievement. For example, higher economic inequality tends to increase entrepreneurship rates at the individual level, suggesting that most entrepreneurial behavior is based on necessity rather than opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Xavier-Oliveira et al. (1 July 2015). ''[http://hum.sagepub.com/content/68/7/1183.abstract What motivates entrepreneurial entry under economic inequality? The role of human and financial capital].'' Human Relations 68(7): 1183-1207, Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opportunity perception and biases===
The ability of entrepreneurs to [[Innovation|innovate]] relates to innate traits, including [[extroversion]] and a proclivity for [[risk-taking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why risk-taking is Important as an Entrepreneur|author=Mike Smith|url=http://www.bestbusinessbooks.store/entrepreneurship-business-blog/why-risk-taking-is-important-as-an-entrepreneur |publisher=Best Business Books Blog |accessdate=22 Aug 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010062710/http://www.bestbusinessbooks.store/entrepreneurship-business-blog/why-risk-taking-is-important-as-an-entrepreneur |archivedate=10 Oct 2017 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Joseph Schumpeter]], the capabilities of innovating, introducing new technologies, increasing efficiency and productivity, or generating new products or services, are characteristic qualities of entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="Dailybsness.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybsness.com/en-wiki/The_basic_characteristics_of_a_successful_entrepreneur |title=The basic characteristics of a successful entrepreneur |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010062714/http://www.dailybsness.com/en-wiki/The_basic_characteristics_of_a_successful_entrepreneur |archivedate=10 Oct 2017 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study has found that certain genes affecting personality may influence the income of self-employed people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Shane | first1=S. | last2=Nicolaou | first2=N. | year=2013 | title=The genetics of entrepreneurial performance | journal=International Small Business Journal | volume=31 | issue=5 | pages=473–495 | doi=10.1177/0266242613485767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people may be able to use{{weasel inline|date=February 2015}} "an innate ability" or [[Spiral of silence#Quasi-statistical sense|quasi-statistical sense]] to gauge [[public opinion]]&lt;ref name= "Miller 2005:278"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets| Miller | 2005 | p = 278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and market demand for new products or services. Entrepreneurs tend to have the ability to see unmet market needs and underserved markets. While some entrepreneurs assume they can sense and figure out what others are thinking, the [[mass media]] plays a crucial role in shaping views and demand.{{sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}} Ramoglou argues that entrepreneurs are not that distinctive and that it is essentially poor conceptualizations of "non-entrepreneurs" that maintain laudatory portraits of "entrepreneurs" as exceptional innovators or leaders &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ramoglou | first1=S. | year=2013 | url=http://isb.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/04/0266242611425838.abstract | title=Who is a 'non-entrepreneur'?

=== Styles===
Differences in entrepreneurial organizations often partially reflect their founders' [[heterogenous]] identities. Fauchart and Gruber have classified entrepreneurs into three main types: [[Charles Darwin|Darwinians]], [[Communitarianism|communitarians]] and [[Missionary|missionaries]]. These types of entrepreneurs diverge in fundamental ways in their self-views, social motivations and patterns of new firm creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fauchart | first1=E | last2=Gruber | first2=M. | year=2011 | title=Darwinians, Communitarians, and Missionaries: The Role of Founder Identify in Entrepreneurship | journal=Academy of Management Journal | volume=54 | issue=5 | pages=935–957 | doi=10.5465/amj.2009.0211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communication ===
Entrepreneurs need to practice effective [[communication]] both within their firm and with external partners and investors in order to launch and growth a venture and enable it to survive. An entrepreneur needs a communication system that links the staff of her firm and connects the firm to outside firms and clients. Entrepreneurs should be [[charismatic leader]]s, so they can communicate a [[vision statement|vision]] effectively to their team and help to [[team building|create a strong team]]. Communicating a vision to followers may be well the most important act of the transformational leader.&lt;ref name="HackmanJohnson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hackman|first=M.Z.|title=Leadership: A communication perspective|year=2009|publisher=Waveland|location=Long Grove, IL|edition=5th|author2=Johnson, C.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compelling visions provide employees with a sense of purpose and encourage commitment. According to Baum et al.&lt;ref name="Baum et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baum|first=Robert J.|author2=Locke, Edwin A. |author3=Kirkpatrick, Shelley A. |title=A longitudinal study of the relation of vision and vision communication to venture growth in entrepreneurial firms.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|year=1998|volume=83|issue=1|pages=43–54|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.83.1.43}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kouzes and Posner,&lt;ref name=Kouzes&gt;{{cite book|last=Kouzes|first=J.M|title=The leadership challenge: How to get extraordinary things done in organizations|year=1987|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|author2=Posner, B.Z.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the vision must be communicated through written statements and through in-person communication. Entrepreneurial leaders must speak and listen to articulate their vision to others.&lt;ref name="Locke et al."&gt;{{cite book|last=Locke|first=E.A.|title=The essence of leadership|year=1991|publisher=Lexington Books|location=New York|author2=Kirkpatrick, S. |author3=Wheeler, J.K |author4=Schneider, J |author5=Niles, K. |author6=Goldstein, H |author7=Welsh, K |author8=Chah, D.O. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication is pivotal in the role of entrepreneurship because it enables leaders to convince potential investors, partners and employees about the feasibility of a venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clarke|first=J.|author2=Cornelissen, J|title=Language, communication, and socially situated cognition in entrepreneurship.

==== Links to sea piracy ====
Research from 2014 found links between entrepreneurship and historical sea [[piracy]]. In this context, the claim is made for a non-moral approach to looking at the history of piracy as a source of inspiration for entrepreneurship education&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, D. (2014) Disruptors are just pirates on the high seas of capitalism. ''The Globe and Mail Special on Business Education'', 5 November 2014.

== Psychological makeup ==
[[File:Steve Jobs Headshot 2010-CROP.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Apple co-founder and longtime leader [[Steve Jobs]] (pictured in 2010) led the introduction of many innovations in the computer, [[smartphone]] and digital music industry]]
[[Stanford University]] economist [[Edward Lazear]] found in a 2005 study that variety in education and work experience was the most important trait that distinguished entrepreneurs from non-entrepreneurs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Lazear |first = Edward | title = Entrepreneurship | publisher = Journal of Labor Economics |volume = 23| issue =  4 | date = 2005 | accessdate = 24 February 2015 |url=http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ521/orazem/Papers/Lazear_entrepreneurship.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study by Uschi Backes-Gellner of the [[University of Zurich]] and Petra Moog of the [[University of Siegen]] in Germany found that a diverse social network was also important in distinguishing students that would go on to become entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Backes-Ge1llner |first=Uschi |last2=Moog |first2 =Petra |title=The disposition to become an entrepreneur and the jacks-of-all-trades in social and human capital |volume=47 |date=December 2013 |pages = 55–72 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535713001236 | accessdate= 24 February 2015 | doi=10.1016/j.socec.2013.08.008 | journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baer  |first=Drake |date= 19 February 2015 |accessdate= 25 February 2015|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/personality-difference-between-entrepreneurs-and-employees-2015-2#ixzz3SklQUxLd-2 |title=Scientists have discovered a personality difference between entrepreneurs and employees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that the psychological propensities for male and [[female entrepreneur]]s are more similar than different. [[Empirical studies]] suggest that female entrepreneurs possess strong negotiating skills and consensus-forming abilities.&lt;ref name= Entrepreneurship&gt;{{cite book|editor-first= Paul|editor-last= Muljadi|title=Entrepreneurship|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=eNy7hA-rvOUC}}|publisher=Paul Muljadi|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231164003/https://books.google.com/books?id=eNy7hA-rvOUC|archivedate=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asa Hansson, who looked at empirical evidence from Sweden, found that the probability of becoming self-employed decreases with age for women, but increases with age for men.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanssan|first=Asa|date=2012|title=Tax policy and entrepreneurship: empirical evidence from Sweden|url=|journal=Small Business Economics|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also found that marriage increased the probability of a person becoming an entrepreneur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Jesper Sørensen wrote that significant influences on the decision to become an entrepreneur are workplace peers and social composition. Sørensen discovered a correlation between working with former entrepreneurs and how often these individuals become entrepreneurs themselves, compared to those who did not work with entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="Sorensen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sørensen | first1=J. | last2=Nanda | first2=R. | url=http://www.edegan.com/pdfs/Nanda%20Sorensen%20(2010)%20-%20Workplace%20peers%20and%20entrepreneurship.pdf | title=Workplace Peers and Entrepreneurship | journal=Management Science | volume=56 | issue=7 | pages=1116–1126 | date=July 2010 | accessdate=30 June 2013 | doi = 10.1287/mnsc.1100.1179 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171010062717/http://www.edegan.com/pdfs/Nanda%20Sorensen%20(2010)%20-%20Workplace%20peers%20and%20entrepreneurship.pdf | archivedate = 10 October 2017 | deadurl = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social composition can influence entrepreneurialism in peers by demonstrating the possibility for success, stimulating a "He can do it, why can't I?" attitude. As Sørensen stated: "When you meet others who have gone out on their own, it doesn't seem that crazy".&lt;ref name="sorensen_interview"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/research/sorensen_peers.html | title=Peers Influence Decision to Become an Entrepreneur | publisher=Stanford Graduate School of Business; News | date=1 September 2009 | accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurs may also be driven to entrepreneurship by past experiences. If they have faced multiple work stoppages or have been unemployed in the past, the probability of them becoming an entrepreneur increases&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Per Cattell's personality framework, both personality traits and attitudes are thoroughly investigated by psychologists. However, in case of entrepreneurship research these notions are employed by academics too, but vaguely. According to Cattell, personality is a system that is related to the environment and further adds that the system seeks explanation to the complex transactions conducted by both—traits and attitudes. This is because both of them bring about change and growth in a person. Personality is that which informs what an individual will do when faced with a given situation. A person's response is triggered by his/her personality and the situation that is faced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Entrepreneurship#http://www.nyenrode.com/FacultyResearch/research/Documents/Research Paper Series/2007/07-04.pdf?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1|ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR]], Retrieved 17 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovative entrepreneurs may be more likely to experience what psychologist [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] calls "[[flow (psychology)|flow]]". "Flow" occurs when an individual forgets about the outside world due to being thoroughly engaged in a process or activity. Csikszentmihalyi suggested that breakthrough innovations tend to occur at the hands of individuals in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mihaly |last=Csikszentmihalyi|title=Flow|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=epmhVuaaoK0C}}|date=13 October 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-187672-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has concluded that a strong internal motivation is a vital ingredient for breakthrough innovation.&lt;ref name="ChristensenJohnson2008"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Clayton |last1=Christensen|first2=Curtis W. |last2=Johnson|first3=Michael B. |last3=Horn|title=Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wiBcUl44FEcC}}|date=14 May 2008|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-164174-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flow can be compared to [[Maria Montessori]]'s concept of normalization, a state that includes a child's capacity for joyful and lengthy periods of intense concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=The Absorbent Mind|year=1967|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Csikszentmihalyi acknowledged that Montessori's prepared environment offers children opportunities to achieve flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rathunde|first=Kevin|first2=Mihaly |last2=Csikszentmihalyi|title=Middle School Students' Motivation and Quality of Experience: A Comparison of Montessori and Traditional School Environments|journal=American Journal of Education|date=May 2005|volume=111|issue=3|pages=341–371|doi=10.1086/428885}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus quality and type of early education may influence entrepreneurial capability.

Research on high-risk settings such as oil platforms, investment banking, medical surgery, aircraft piloting and nuclear power plants has related distrust to failure avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conchie | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Donald | first2 = I. J. | year = 2007 | title = The functions and development of safety-specific trust and distrust | url = | journal = Safety Science | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 92–103 | doi=10.1016/j.ssci.2007.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; When non-routine strategies are needed, distrusting persons perform better while when routine strategies are needed trusting persons perform better. This research was extended to entrepreneurial firms by Gudmundsson and Lechner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gudmundsson | first1 = S.V. | last2 = Lechner | first2 = C. | year = 2013 | title = Cognitive Biases, Organization, and Entrepreneurial Firm Survival | url = | journal = European Management Journal | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 278–294 | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2013.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that in entrepreneurial firms the threat of failure is ever present resembling non-routine situations in high-risk settings. They found that the firms of distrusting entrepreneurs were more likely to survive than the firms of optimistic or overconfident entrepreneurs. The reasons were that distrusting entrepreneurs would emphasize failure avoidance through sensible task selection and more analysis. Kets de Vries has pointed out that distrusting entrepreneurs are more alert about their external environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kets de Vries | first1 = M. | year = 2003 | title = The entrepreneur on the couch | url = | journal = INSEAD Quarterly | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 17–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that distrusting entrepreneurs are less likely to discount negative events and are more likely to engage control mechanisms. Similarly, Gudmundsson and Lechner found that distrust leads to higher precaution and therefore increases chances of entrepreneurial firm survival.

Researchers Schoon and Duckworth completed a study in 2012 that could potentially help identify who may become an entrepreneur at an early age. They determined that the best measures to identify a young entrepreneur are family and social status, parental role modeling, entrepreneurial competencies at age 10, academic attainment at age 10, generalized self-efficacy, social skills, entrepreneurial intention and experience of unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoon|first1=Ingrid|last2=Duckworth|first2=Kathryn|title=Who becomes an entrepreneur? Early life experiences as predictors of entrepreneurship.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2012|volume=48|issue=6|pages=1719–1726|doi=10.1037/a0029168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic===
Some scholars have constructed an operational definition of a more specific subcategory called "Strategic Entrepreneurship". Closely tied with principles of strategic management, this form of entrepreneurship is "concerned about growth, creating value for customers and subsequently creating wealth for owners".&lt;ref name="Hitt, M. A. 2011"&gt;Hitt, M. A., Ireland, R., Sirmon, D. G., &amp; Trahms, C. A. (2011). ''Strategic Entrepreneurship: Creating Value for Individuals, Organizations, and Society''. Academy of Management Perspectives, 25(2), 57-75. {{doi|10.5465/AMP.2011.61020802}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 article for the Academy of Management provided a three-step, "Input-Process-Output" model of strategic entrepreneurship. The model's three steps entail the collection of different resources, the process of orchestrating them in the necessary manner and the subsequent creation of competitive advantage, value for customers, wealth and other benefits. Through the proper use of strategic management/leadership techniques and the implementation of risk-bearing entrepreneurial thinking, the strategic entrepreneur is therefore able to align resources to create value and wealth.&lt;ref name="Hitt, M. A. 2011"/&gt;

=== Leadership ===
Leadership in entrepreneurship can be defined as "process of social influence in which one person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chemers|first=M.|title=An integrative theory of leadership|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|isbn=978-0-8058-2679-1|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; in "one who undertakes innovations, finance and business acumen in an effort to transform innovations into economic goods".&lt;ref name="Shane"/&gt; This refers to not only the act of entrepreneurship as managing or starting a business, but how one manages to do so by these social processes, or leadership skills. Entrepreneurship in itself can be defined as "the process by which individuals, teams, or organizations identify and pursue entrepreneurial opportunities without being immediately constrained by the resources they currently control".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hitt, M. A., Ireland, R. D., Hoskisson, R. E.. (2011). ''Strategic Management''. (9th ed.). Mason, Ohio: South-Western Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; An entrepreneur typically has a mindset that seeks out potential opportunities during uncertain times.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; An entrepreneur must have leadership skills or qualities  to see potential opportunities and act upon them. At the core, an entrepreneur is a decision maker. Such decisions often affect an organization as a whole, which is representative of their leadership amongst the organization.

With the growing global market and increasing technology use throughout all industries, the core of entrepreneurship and the decision-making has become an ongoing process rather than isolated incidents. This becomes [[knowledge management]] which is "identifying and harnessing intellectual assets" for organizations to "build on past experiences and create new mechanisms for exchanging and creating knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Heaton, L. H. (2008) Knowledge Management. ''International Encyclopedia of Communication.'' Boston: Blackledge.&lt;/ref&gt; This belief draws upon a leader's past experiences that may prove useful. It is a common mantra for one to learn from their past mistakes, so leaders should take advantage of their failures for their benefit. This is how one may take their experiences as a leader for the use in the core of entrepreneurship-decision making.

=== Global leadership ===
The majority of scholarly research done on these topics have been from North America.&lt;ref&gt;Boyacigiller, N. &amp; Adler, N. J. (1991). The Parochial Dinosaur: The Organizational Sciences in Global Context. ''Academy of Management Review.''&lt;/ref&gt; Words like "leadership" and "entrepreneurship" do not always translate well into other cultures and languages. For example, in North America a leader is often thought to be charismatic, but German culture frowns on such charisma due to the charisma of Nazi leader Adolph Hitler. Other cultures, like some European countries, view the term "leader" negatively, like the French.&lt;ref&gt;Grauman, C. F. (1986). ''Changing Conceptions of Leadership.''&lt;/ref&gt; The participative leadership style that is encouraged in the United States is considered disrespectful in many other parts of the world due to the differences in power distance.&lt;ref&gt;Hofestede, G. (1991). ''Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind.''&lt;/ref&gt; Many Asian and Middle Eastern countries do not have "open door" policies for subordinates and would never informally approach their managers/bosses. For countries like that, an authoritarian approach to management and leadership is more customary.

Despite cultural differences, the successes and failures of entrepreneurs can be traced to how leaders adapt to local conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, G. (1980). Motivation, Leadership and Organization: Do American Theories Apply Abroad? ''Organizational Dynamics.''&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasingly global business environment a successful leader must be able to adapt and have insight into other cultures. To respond to the environment, corporate visions are becoming transnational in nature, to enable the organization to operate in or provide services/goods for other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, N. J. % Gundersen, A. (2008). ''International Dimensions of Organizational Behavior''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entrepreneurship training and education ==
Michelacci and Schivardi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencespo.fr/liepp/sites/sciencespo.fr.liepp/files/paper_Are_They_All_Like_Bill_Michelacci.pdf|title = Are They All Like Bill, Mark, and Steve? The Education Premium for Entrepreneurs|last = Michelacci|first = Claudio|date = 24 June 2015|journal = EIEF|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a pair of researchers who believe that identifying and comparing the relationships between an entrepreneur's earnings and education level would determine the rate and level of success. Their study focused on two education levels, college degree and post-graduate degree. While Michelacci and Schivardi do not specifically determine characteristics or traits for successful entrepreneurs, they do believe that there is a direct relationship between education and success, noting that having a college knowledge does contribute to advancement in the workforce.

Michelacci and Schivardi state there has been a rise in the number of self-employed people with a baccalaureate degree. However, their findings also show that those who are self-employed and possess a graduate degree has remained consistent throughout time at about 33 percent. They briefly mention those famous entrepreneurs like [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Mark Zuckerberg]] who were college dropouts, but they call these cases all but exceptional as it is a pattern that many entrepreneurs view formal education as costly, mainly because of the [[Opportunity cost|time that needs to be spent on it]]. Michelacci and Schivardi believe that in order for an individual to reach the full success they need to have education beyond high school. Their research shows that the higher the education level the greater the success. The reason is that college gives people additional skills that can be used within their business and to operate on a higher level than someone who only "runs" it.

== Resources and financing ==

=== Entrepreneurial resources ===
An entrepreneurial resource is any company-owned [[asset]] that has [[economic value]] creating capabilities. Economic value creating both tangible and intangible sources are considered as entrepreneurial resources. Their economic value is generating activities or services through mobilization by entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Organizing Entrepreneurship|last=Anna Grandori; Laura Gaillard Giordani|first=|last2=|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=978-0-415-57037-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurial resources can be divided into two fundamental categories: tangible and intangible resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management Theory: An Integrated Approach|last=Charles W. L. Hill; Gareth R. Jones|first=|publisher=South-Western College Pub|isbn=978-0-538-75107-0|location=|pages=|date=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tangible resources are material sources such as equipment, building, furniture, land, vehicle, machinery, stock, cash, bond and inventory that has a physical form and can be quantified. On the contrary, intangible resources are nonphysical or more challenging to identify and evaluate, and they possess more value creating capacity such as human resources including skills and experience in a particular field, organizational structure of the company, brand name, reputation, entrepreneurial networks that contribute to promotion and financial support, [[know-how]], [[intellectual property]] including both [[copyright]]s, [[trademark]]s and [[patent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Business Strategy: Concepts and Cases (Strategic Management)|last=R. Duane Ireland; Robert E. Hoskisson; Michael A. Hitt|first=|publisher=South-Western College Pub|isbn=978-0-324-57899-7|location=|pages=|date=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Strategic Management|last=Charles W. L. Hill; Gareth R. Jones|first=|publisher=South-Western College Pub|isbn=978-0-547-19432-5|location=|pages=|date=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bootstrapping ===
At least early on, entrepreneurs often "[[Leveraged buyout|bootstrap-finance]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses|last=Bhide|first=Amar|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0195170313|location=http://www.bhide.net/books/Origin%20and%20Evolution/part1.pdf|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; their start-up rather than seeking external [[investor]]s from the start. One of the reasons that some entrepreneurs prefer to "bootstrap" is that obtaining [[equity financing]] requires the entrepreneur to provide ownership shares to the investors. If the start-up becomes successful later on, these early equity financing deals could provide a windfall for the investors and a huge loss for the entrepreneur. If investors have a significant stake in the company, they may as well be able to exert influence on company strategy, [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) choice and other important decisions. This is often problematic since the investor and the founder might have different incentives regarding the long-term goal of the company. An investor will generally aim for a profitable exit and therefore promotes a high-valuation sale of the company or IPO in order to sell their shares. Whereas the entrepreneur might have philanthropic intentions as their main driving force. Soft values like this might not go well with the short-term pressure on yearly and quarterly profits that publicly traded companies often experience from their owners.

One consensus definition of bootstrapping sees it as "a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ebbena|first1=Jay|last2=Johnson|first2=Alec|title=Bootstrapping in small firms: An empirical analysis of change over time|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883902605000662|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|publicationdate=November 2006|volume=21|issue=6|pages=851–865|doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2005.06.007|accessdate=29 July 2014|quote=Bootstrapping has taken on many definitions in the literature, but there has been some recent consensus that it is a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors (Winborg and Landstrom, 2001 and Harrison and Mason, 1997).|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of businesses require less than $10,000 to launch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/trends-stats/know-small-businesses-start-10000-less/|title=Did You Know?

In addition, bootstrapping entrepreneurs often incur personal [[credit-card]] debt, but they also can utilize a wide variety of methods. While bootstrapping involves increased personal financial risk for entrepreneurs, the absence of any other [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] gives the entrepreneur more freedom to develop the company. Many successful companies, including [[Dell]] Computer and [[Facebook]], started by bootstrapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richtopia.com/effective-leadership/10-successful-companies-started-bootstrapping-case-studies|title=Ten Successful Companies That Started by Bootstrapping|work=Richtopia|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Additional financing ===

=== Effect of taxes ===
Entrepreneurs are faced with [[liquidity constraint]]s and often lack the necessary [[credit (finance)|credit]] needed to borrow large amounts of money to finance their venture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meh|first=Cesaire Assah|date=2002|title=Entrepreneurial Risk, Credit Constraints, and the Corporate Income Tax: A Quantitative Exploration|url=|journal=Bank of Canada, Working Papers 2002-21|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, many studies have been done on the effects of taxes on entrepreneurs. The studies fall into two camps: the first camp finds that taxes help and the second argues that taxes hurt entrepreneurship.

Cesaire Assah Meh found that corporate taxes create an incentive to become an entrepreneur to avoid double taxation.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Donald Bruce and John Deskins found literature suggesting that a higher corporate tax rate may reduce a state's share of entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruce|first=Donald and John Deskins|date=2012|title=Can state tax policies be used to promote entrepreneurial activity?|url=|journal=Small Business Economics|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also found that states with an inheritance or [[estate tax]] tend to have lower entrepreneurship rates when using a tax-based measure.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; However, another study found that states with a more [[Progressive taxation|progressive personal income tax]] have a higher percentage of sole proprietors in their workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asoni|first=Andrea and Tino Sanandaji|date=2012|title=Taxation and the quality of entrepreneurship|url=|journal=J Econ|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, many studies find that the effect of taxes on the probability of becoming an entrepreneur is small. Donald Bruce and Mohammed Mohsin found that it would take a 50 percentage point drop in the top tax rate to produce a one percent change in entrepreneurial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruce|first=Donald and Mohammed Mohsin|date=2006|title=Tax Policy and Entrepreneurship: New Time Series Evidence|url=|journal=Small Business Economics|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Epilepsy]]''' can affect '''[[employment]]''' for a variety of reasons. Many employers are reluctant to hire a person they know has epilepsy, even if the seizures are controlled by medication. If the employee suffers a seizure while at work, they could harm themselves (but rarely others, contrary to popular belief) depending on the nature of the work. Employers are often unwilling to bear any financial costs that may come from employing a person with epilepsy, i.e. insurance costs, paid sick leave etc. Many people whose seizures are successfully controlled by a medication suffer from a variety of side effects, most notably [[drowsiness]], which may affect [[job performance]]. Many laws prohibit or restrict people with epilepsy from performing certain duties, most notably [[epilepsy and driving|driving]] or operating dangerous machinery, thereby lowering the pool of jobs available to people with epilepsy. Epilepsy sufferers are also prohibited from joining the armed forces, though they may work in certain civilian military positions.

Employment issues are responsible for 85% of the cost of epilepsy on society.&lt;ref name="William O. Tatum page 112"&gt;Epilepsy A to Z: A Concise Encyclopedia By William O. Tatum, Peter W. Kaplan, Pierre Jallon: page 112&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], the median income for persons with epilepsy is 93% that of all persons. The unemployment rate for persons with epilepsy has been reported to be between 25% and 69%. The high school graduation rate has been reported at 64%, compared with an overall national average of 82%.&lt;ref&gt;The treatment of epilepsy: principles &amp; practice By Elaine Wyllie, Ajay Gupta, Deepak K. Lachhwani: page 1203&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
The following issues exist for people with epilepsy in their quest for and performance of employment:

===Barring from employment===
People with epilepsy may be barred from various types of employment, either by law, by company regulations, or by common sense, thereby lowering the pool of jobs available to the job seeker.&lt;ref&gt;Managing Epilepsy: A Clinical Handbook By Malcolm P. Taylor: page 114-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Those barred from driving by the laws of the land in which they reside cannot perform any jobs that involve operating a motor vehicle. Even if the patients are permitted by law to drive their own vehicle, they may be barred by local and national laws from driving a vehicle for the purpose of certain types of employment, such as getting a Commercial Driver's License or driving a school bus or being the engineer of a train (even if a person who has not had a seizure in a certain time period is not permanently banned, they may still have to be able to stay seizure-free for a year or more even without medication).&lt;ref name="Robert J. Gumnit page 174"&gt;Living Well with Epilepsy By Robert J. Gumnit: page 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries bar those who have ever had a seizure from flying an aircraft, except perhaps for a private craft, especially if the aircraft in question is a commercial or military aircraft or is any type of jet, making a career in aviation or in space extremely unlikely (again, some people who have been seizure-free without medication for a considerable time period, usually at least a year, are allowed to fly- even jets- in some cases, if they can remain seizure-free for at least a year without using anticonvulsant drugs).&lt;ref name="Robert J. Gumnit page 174"/&gt;

Jobs involving the operation of dangerous machinery may pose a problem to people with epilepsy, including [[construction]] and [[industry|industrial]] work.&lt;ref name="Robert J. Gumnit page 174"/&gt;

Many places have laws barring those with epilepsy whose seizures are not entirely controlled from working in positions that involve a high degree of responsibility to the well-being of others. This includes [[police officer]]s, [[teacher]]s, and [[health care]] workers.&lt;ref name="Robert J. Gumnit page 174"/&gt;

===Occupational hazards===
There are many hazards that people with epilepsy, including those whose seizures are fully controlled by medication, face in the workplace. Those with active seizures face the obvious risk of loss of consciousness or muscle control, and those with side effects face diminished concentration or physical strength. Some of the hazards include:&lt;ref&gt;Epilepsy A to Z: A Concise Encyclopedia By William O. Tatum, Peter W. Kaplan, Pierre Jallon: page 113&lt;/ref&gt;
*Working near a body of water, a high-voltage power line, or at extreme heights
*Working with machines, equipment, or hazardous chemicals or materials that require care in their usage
*The supervision of other persons, where any lapse in such supervision may be hazardous

===Transportation===
Even if a person with epilepsy is able to safely perform job duties him/herself, many are limited where they can work if they cannot provide their own transportation to the job site. Since some cannot drive themselves to work, they cannot travel to a place of employment.&lt;ref&gt;Living Well with Epilepsy By Robert J. Gumnit: page 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Women with epilepsy: a handbook of health and treatment issues By Martha J. Morrell, Kerry L. Flynn: page 282&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people with epilepsy who cannot drive may also be unable to safely walk, use [[public transportation]], or otherwise independently travel safely due to their seizure risk, further preventing them from reaching a place of employment. Such persons may be at risk for suffering seizures while on or waiting for a public transport vehicle or while crossing the street.&lt;ref name="William O. Tatum page 112"/&gt;

===Stigma===
[[social stigma|Stigma]] alone can make it more difficult for people with epilepsy to find jobs. Even if one's seizures are fully controlled by medication, or if the condition has been completely cured by surgery, many employers are reluctant to hire a person with epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;Epilepsy: Patient and Family Guide By Orrin Devinsky: page 45&lt;/ref&gt;

United States law does not require an applicant for a job to disclose one's condition to the employer. If an applicant voluntarily reveals one's condition, the employer is only allowed to ask whether the employee requires any special accommodations, and if so, what types.&lt;ref name="eeoc.gov"&gt;http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/epilepsy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

If an employer learns of an epileptic condition ''after'' making a decision to hire an employee, the employer is not legally permitted to withdraw the decision to hire as a result of this information ''unless'' the employee's duties will pose a risk to public safety. If this is the case, the employer is permitted to require the employee to obtain information from a physician regarding this.

Federal law in the United States requires that federal government agencies and employers receiving federal funding cannot discriminate in hiring against a prospective employee with epilepsy unless the duties one would be performing can be unsafe with a seizure disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Living Well with Epilepsy By Robert J. Gumnit: page 218&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special accommodations===
Employees who have epilepsy may require special accommodations from their employers. Although against the law, some employers may feel reluctant to provide these accommodations. Some special needs include:&lt;ref&gt;Epilepsy: Patient and Family Guide By Orrin Devinsky: page 287&lt;/ref&gt;

====Safety====
*Safety shields around pieces of equipment (which should be considered standard for ''all'' workers)
*Carpeting on concrete or other hard floors

====Hours====
*Extra [[break (work)|breaks]] for one who is often drowsy or fatigued as a result of one's condition
*Extended breaks following a seizure, should one occur
*Days off from work in the event a longer recovery is needed

==Seizures while on duty==
According to the law of the [[United States]], an employer is permitted to inquire into an employee's epileptic condition if the employee suffers one or more seizures while on duty only if they affect safety or job performance.&lt;ref name="eeoc.gov"/&gt;

The employer is permitted to require the employee to take a leave of absence or reassign the employee until the issues are resolved if the seizures pose a threat to the safety of others.

==Epilepsy as a disability==
Depending on the severity, epilepsy can be considered a disability which makes employment very difficult or even impossible for many sufferers for a variety of reasons. Those with seizures that cannot be controlled may find themselves unable to perform job duties of any type because their consciousness is constantly interrupted by the seizures. The aftermath of an often unpredictable seizure may leave a patient too fatigued to work for a period of time, or may temporarily impair the patient's memory. Seizures may pose a hazard to the employee or others in the event the employee loses consciousness while performing certain duties. Even if the seizures are completely controlled by a medication, side effects, such as drowsiness or fatigue, may make the performance of duties impossible or more difficult. 

In the [[United States]], while the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] does not fully protect persons with epilepsy from discrimination in hiring practices, the [[Social Security Administration]] only considers people with epilepsy "disabled" and thereby eligible to receive benefits if the condition severely limits one or more major life activities.&lt;ref&gt;Epilepsy: Patient and Family Guide By Orrin Devinsky: pge 283&lt;/ref&gt; Employment may be hard to find or perform for many people with epilepsy, but not all are eligible for government-sponsored disability payments.

To qualify, documentation to the [[Social Security Administration]] of an [[EEG]] detailing a typical seizure is required, though a normal diagnosis does not rule out benefits. A seizure diary, including times and dates of seizures, and the effects the seizures have had is required. A person may qualify either if the seizures themselves have debilitating effects, or if the drugs used to treat the disorder have side effects that make employment impossible or difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Epilepsy: Patient and Family Guide By Orrin Devinsky: page 308&lt;/ref&gt;

==Armed forces==
Many countries restrict people with epilepsy from joining their [[armed forces]].

In the United States, in order to enroll in military service in a combat role, one must be seizure-free since age 5 and off all medications.&lt;ref&gt;Living Well with Epilepsy By Robert J. Gumnit: pages 173-74&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]] people with epilepsy are automatically barred for life from joining the military.

'''Esther Driver du Pont, Lady Thouron''' (January 21, 1908 &amp;ndash; March 24, 1984) was an American horse breeder and [[philanthropist]] who created the [[Thouron Award]] with her husband, Sir [[John R.H. Thouron]] KBE.

==Biography==
Born in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], she was a member of the wealthy [[Du Pont family]], one of eight children born to [[Lammot du Pont II]] and Natalie Driver Wilson.

From 1928 to 1939, she was married to Campbell Weir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19391104&amp;id=MP5VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7-MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1247,1210639 |title=Daughter of DuPont Divorces Former Clerk |agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |date=November 4, 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, she married for a second time to John Rupert Hunt Thouron, a native of [[Cookham]] in [[Berkshire]], [[England]]. In 1960, they established the [[Thouron Award|Thouron Scholars Program]] of student exchanges between the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and leading universities in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1967, she received an [[Honorary Doctorate]] in Humane Letters from the University of Pennsylvania in recognition of her work.

===Thoroughbred horse racing===
Esther du Pont and her husband owned a large estate near [[Unionville, Chester County, Pennsylvania]] they called "Doe Run." Like other du Pont family members such as [[William duPont, Jr.]], [[Allaire du Pont]], [[Marion duPont Scott]], [[Jane du Pont Lunger]], and [[Alice du Pont Mills]], Esther du Pont too became a fan of [[thoroughbred]] [[horse racing]]. She bred and raced a number of horses for both [[flat racing]] and [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]] events. In 1944, her horse [[Burma Road (horse)|Burma Road]] won the most prestigious [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]] race in the United States, the [[American Grand National]] and in [[flat racing]], her colt [[Royal Vale (horse)|Royal Vale]] won the 1953 [[Massachusetts Handicap]].

Esther du Pont Thouron helped build the clinic and hospital at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine]]'s [[New Bolton Center]]. In 1966, her contribution to the industry was recognized by the [[Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association]] who awarded her its Lady's Sportsmanship Award.

===Death===
Esther du Pont Thouron died at her winter home in Florida on March 24, 1984, at age 76.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/docs/kislak/dp/1984/1984_03_26.pdf |title=Thouron Founder Dies at 76|author=Jeffrey Goldberg |work=[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]] |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]] |date=March 26, 1984 |accessdate=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federation of the European Sporting Goods Industry (FESI)''' is a [[Brussels]]-based European platform representing the interests of some 1,800 European [[sporting goods]] manufacturers before the [[European institutions|European Institutions]], Sport Governing bodies such as [[UEFA]] and  other international sport federations or associations. It is also the founder of the House of Sport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fesi-sport.org/content/house-sport|title=The House of Sport - Federation of the European Sporting Goods Industry (FESI)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which it (together with nineteen partners) - plays a crucial role in raising awareness on the benefits of sports and physical activity through cross-sectoral cooperation. Note that since 2015 FESI is also an official partner of the European Week of Sport&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/sport/week/|title=European Week of Sport 2016 #BeActive - European Commission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (EWOS).

The association aims to provide opportunities for sporting goods companies to collaborate on non-commercial pre-competitive issues of common interest, monitor legislative initiatives relating to the sporting goods industry at a European level, advocate for the sporting goods industry in Brussels, and communicate with European stakeholders about issues from trade and the [[supply chain]], the environment and  [[product safety]].

==History==

FESI was created in the early sixties with the aim of achieving [[free and fair]] trade in Europe while facilitating trade worldwide. In October 1994, FESI headquarters moved to Brussels, a strategic step which has allowed FESI to increase its [[European Union lobbying|lobbying]] and enhance its impact on European institutions.

In February 2002, during an Extraordinary General Assembly, FESI decided to allow sports manufacturers a direct voting right in its main decision bodies. Sports manufacturers can thus become FESI Regular Members in the same way as FESI's 12 National Federations.

In December 2002, following some months of consultation and negotiation, FESI and FEPI (Federation of the European Play Industry) signed a [[letter of intent]] which paved the way for a future collaboration between both organizations.

[[File:Fifth Av BMT 59 tile jeh.JPG|thumb|left|175px|Mosaics]]
[[File:5th Avenue BMT 9317.JPG|thumb|left|175px|Directional mosaics]]
The station has two tracks and two [[side platform]]s, with a [[mezzanine]] above both the western and eastern ends of the station. Replicas of [[Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation|BMT]] directional mosaics “QUEENS TRAINS” and “BROOKLYN TRAINS” are found on the western exit. Each mezzanine has one stair to each platform.  Mosaics “5”, “Fifth Ave,” and the directional signs on each platform, are fully preserved with new tiles encircling around them.

This station was overhauled in the late 1970s. The MTA fixed the station's structure and overall appearance, replacing the original wall tiles, old signs, and incandescent lighting with 1970s modern-look wall tile band and tablet mosaics, signs and fluorescent lights. It also fixed staircases and platform edges. In 2002, the station received a major overhaul. It received state-of-art repairs as well as an upgrade of the station for [[ADA compliance]] and restoration the original late 1910s tiling. The MTA repaired the staircases, re-tiling for the walls, installed new tiling on the floors, upgraded the station's lights and the public address system, and installed [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] yellow safety threads along the platform edges, new signs, and new track-beds in both directions.

Artwork here was made in 1997 by Ann Schaumburger and is called ''Urban Oasis.'' It uses glass mosaic murals to depict families of different types of animals, particularly for the nearby [[Central Park Zoo]].

===Exits===
The full-time side of the station at the north end, at 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, has three street staircases, one carved into the outer perimeter of [[Central Park]] (northwestern corner of that intersection) and the other two on either eastern corner of the intersection.&lt;ref name="MTAMaps-Midtown-2015"/&gt; The part-time side at [[Central Park South]], just by the [[Plaza Hotel]], formerly had a booth (closed in 2003) and three street staircases as well: two carved inside Central Park's perimeter, on the northern side of Central Park South, and one to the southern side, inside a building just west of the Plaza Hotel.&lt;ref name="MTAMaps-Midtown-2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/maps/neighborhoods/mn/M11_midtown_2015.pdf|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: Midtown|date=2015|website=mta.info|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metropolitan Transit Authority]]|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hobart City Centre''' (referred to as '''Town''' or '''Hobart CBD''') is a suburb surrounded by metropolitan [[Hobart]], which comprises the original settlement, the central business district, and other built-up areas. It is the oldest part of Hobart and includes many of the city's important institutions and landmarks, such as [[Parliament House, Hobart|Parliament]], the [[Supreme Court of Tasmania|Supreme Court]], [[Franklin Square (Hobart)|Franklin Square]], the [[Elizabeth Street Mall]], the [[Royal Hobart Hospital]], the [[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]], [[State Library of Tasmania|State Library]], the [[NAB Building]], the [[Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery|Museum]], and the [[Hobart Cenotaph|Cenotaph]]. The city centre is located in the local government areas of the [[City of Hobart]].

Although the city centre is one of the oldest and most developed areas of Hobart, demographically it is one of the less densely populated areas in the greater area of Hobart, due to its core being commercial. In an attempt to create a more vibrant city at night, the state government has been encouraging inner city residential development in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2010 | url = http://www.hobartcity.com.au/Publications/Strategies_and_Plans/Affordable_Housing_Strategy_2010-2012 | title = Affordable Housing Strategy 2010-2012 | publisher = [[Hobart City Council]] | accessdate = 2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2010 | url = http://macquariepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Doc-L.pdf | title = Hobart- A world class, liveable waterfront city | publisher = [[Government of Tasmania]] | accessdate = 2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the city centre was 456 in 2006.&lt;ref name="stats" /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Hobart}}
Settlement of Greater Hobart spawned from the settlement of [[Sullivans Cove]] on 21 February 1804, by order of [[David Collins (governor)|David Collins]] who was most unimpressed with the initial landing site at [[Risdon Cove]].

==Geography==
The Hobart city centre draws a sense of its identity from its location between the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|Derwent River]] and the foot hills of [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]]. The city is concentrated with [[Low-rise]] office buildings, interspersed by parks such as Franklin Square and St Davids Park and historic precincts such as [[Sullivans Cove]] and [[Salamanca Place]]. Due to street width, the majority of Hobart CBD's streets are [[One-way traffic|One-way]] with a few exceptions including [[Elizabeth Street, Hobart|Elizabeth Street]], the main north-south thoroughfare of the city centre. [[Davey Street, Hobart|Davey Street]]/[[Macquarie Street, Hobart|Macquarie]] travel parallel as a [[one-way couplet]] carrying traffic between Hobart's major highways along the CBD's southern fringe. The streets run on a slightly warped [[Street grid|grid pattern]] in the CBD, due to early planning by [[Lachlan Macquarie]].

==Governance==
Administratively, the [[Hobart]] City Centre falls under the authority of the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of the [[City of Hobart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hobartcity.com.au/Home/|title=Home|publisher=[[Hobart City Council]]|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tasmanian Government]] also has authority over some aspects of the CBD, in particular the major state controlled roads passing through and around the city.

==Commercial area==
With the exception of [[Wrest Point Hotel Casino|Wrest Point Casino]] in [[Sandy Bay, Tasmania|Sandy Bay]], the Hobart CBD contains all of [[Tasmania]]’s tallest buildings, including 39 Murray Street, 188 Collins Street and the [[Trafalgar Building, Hobart|Trafalgar Building]]. The tallest building in the city centre is [[NAB House]] at {{Convert|58|m|ft|abbr=on}}, however planning restrictions limit future developments to a height of {{Convert|42|m|ft|abbr=on}}. There have been some exceptions to this rule such as Wellington Centre standing at {{Convert|48|m|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hobartcity.com.au/files/dcac42ce-2871-4977-af21-a1d200ebd620/Central_Area_Review_Background_Report_June_2013.pdf|title=Central Area Provisions Background Report|publisher=[[Hobart City Council]]|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new [[Royal Hobart Hospital|Royal Hobart Hospital K1/K2 Twin Towers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/builders-named-for-two-new-towers-of-the-royal-hobart-hospital/story-fnj4f7k1-1226708599101|title=Builders named for two new towers of the Royal Hobart Hospital |publisher=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hobartcity.com.au/files/ceece4e2-29c2-4de3-b874-a0cb00fdc973/48_Liverpool_St_RHH_redevelopment.pdf|title=Supporting Assessment Information|publisher=[[Hobart City Council]]|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which when complete, will stand at {{Convert|48|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.

==Culture==
There is a large concentration of cultural institutions within the CBD including: the [[Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery]], the [[State Library of Tasmania]], the Playhouse Theatre, and the [[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]].

Every December, the city hosts the conclusion of the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]] while concurrently holding the [[Taste Festival]]. 
Every January the city hosts the [[Australian Wooden Boat Festival]] and the annual [[Royal Hobart Regatta]] is held during February.

Additional, the [[Salamanca Market]] is held at [[Salamanca Place]] every Saturday.

* More the data is found, more are the chances of fraud level
* Data sources are used which include intelligence for smart detection
* Prioritising investigations depending upon fraud level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/experian-india-launches-new-fraud-solution-for-banking-and-insurance/articleshow/51992468.cms|title=Experian India launches new fraud solution for banking and insurance - The Economic Times|newspaper=The Economic Times|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Closed user group (CUG)'''

Presently, [[Experian]] maintains a network of 47 banks and 15 life insurer companies as a part of the CUG, that covers 50 per cent of the retail banking applications whose data is verified timely. With increase in these numbers, it can become a more complicated and secured database.

== Methodology ==
There are various criteria based on which information is matched in the loan application from different data sources and inconsistencies after that are identified.The company has some sophisticated analytical solutions which allows it to create an advanced analytical approach, to predict and calculate some authentic score that can help banks lower their losses. A data repository has been created to collect the data of all the past customers in addition to their [[Know your customer|KYC]] norms data, on which data mining is performed to filter out the useful minute details and extrapolate the user's data. The solution has some customised rules to analyse different data sources to highlight inconsistencies and discrepancies so that it can match with the known fraud data. The results calculate the level of fraud risk and any application if found suspicious is moved into a special investigation tool to take further action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mortgagestrategy.co.uk/issues/18-february-2013/the-war-on-fraud/|title=The war on fraud - Mortgage Strategy|date=2013-02-18|newspaper=Mortgage Strategy|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Section 45 of the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, if three years duration is crossed for any reason to reject an insurance claim then it can not be rejected after that period. So, this repository would help them catch criminals before they breach the obstacles to commit fraud. Data from life insurers reveals that there is about 20 per cent rise year by year in fraudulent claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/experian-s-data-repository-to-do-micro-segment-scrutiny-to-prevent-life-insurance-frauds-115090400777_1.html|title=Experian's Hunter to detect life insurance fraud|last=Saraswathy|first=M.|date=2015-09-05|newspaper=Business Standard India|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nexus has been identified of fraudulent people who get their claims passed through their relatives in the authorities which pass the claims. Depending on the screening, businesses will be able to identify applications that have high probability of potential fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Experian-launches-credit-monitor-Hunter-Fraud-Score/articleshow/51993403.cms|title=Experian launches credit monitor Hunter Fraud Score - Times of India|newspaper=The Times of India|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Bank Account Number''' ('''IBAN''') is an internationally agreed system of identifying [[bank account]]s across national borders to facilitate the communication and processing of cross border transactions with a reduced risk of [[transcription error]]s. It was originally adopted by the [[European Committee for Banking Standards]] (ECBS), and later as an international standard under ISO 13616:1997. The current standard is ISO 13616:2007, which indicates [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication|SWIFT]] as the formal registrar. Initially developed to facilitate payments within the [[European Union]], it has been implemented by most European countries and numerous countries in the other parts of the world, mainly in the [[Middle East]] and in the [[Caribbean]]. As of February 2016, 69 countries were using the IBAN numbering system.&lt;ref name=IBANRegistry/&gt;

The IBAN consists of up to 34 alphanumeric characters comprising: a country code; two [[check digit]]s; and a number that includes the domestic bank account number, branch identifier, and potential routing information. The check digits enable a check of the bank account number to confirm its integrity before submitting a transaction.

==Background==
Before IBAN, differing national standards for bank account identification (i.e. bank, branch, routing codes, and account number) were confusing for some users. This often led to necessary routing information being missing from payments. Routing information as specified by [[ISO 9362]] (also known as Business Identifier Codes (BIC code), SWIFT ID or SWIFT code, and SWIFT-BIC) does not require a specific format for the transaction so the identification of accounts and transaction types is left to agreements of the transaction partners. It also does not contain check digits, so errors of transcription were not detectable and it was not possible for a sending bank to validate the routing information prior to submitting the payment. Routing errors caused delayed payments and incurred extra costs to the sending and receiving banks and often to intermediate routing banks.&lt;ref name=Overview_CY&gt;{{cite journal

|accessdate = 7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, to overcome these difficulties, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) published ISO 13616:1997.&lt;ref name=ISO136161997&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=21228

|date = 24 July 2003
|accessdate = 11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal had a degree of flexibility, which the [[European Committee for Banking Standards]] (ECBS) believed would make it unworkable, and they produced a "slimmed down" version of the standard which, amongst other things, permitted only upper-case letters and required that the IBAN for each country have a fixed length.&lt;ref name=SIG203/&gt; ISO 13616:1997 was subsequently withdrawn and replaced by ISO 13616:2003.&lt;ref name=ISO136161997/&gt; The standard was revised again in 2007 when it was split into two parts. ISO 13616-1:2007 "specifies the elements of an international bank account number (IBAN) used to facilitate the processing of data internationally in data interchange, in financial environments as well as within and between other industries" but "does not specify internal procedures, file organization techniques, storage media, languages, etc. to be used in its implementation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

IBAN imposes a flexible but regular format sufficient for account identification and contains validation information to avoid errors of transcription. It carries all the routing information needed to get a payment from one bank to another wherever it may be; it contains key bank account details such as country code, branch codes (known as [[sort code]]s in the UK and Ireland) and account numbers, and it contains ''check digits'' which can be validated at source according to a single standard procedure.&lt;ref name=ECBS&gt;{{cite web | title = IBAN: International Bank Account Number | work = EBS204 V3.2 | publisher = European Committee for Banking Standards | date = August 2003 | url = http://www.cnb.cz/miranda2/export/sites/www.cnb.cz/cs/platebni_styk/iban/download/EBS204.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 1 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where used, IBANs have reduced trans-national money transfer errors to under 0.1% of total payments.

==Structure==

The IBAN consists of up to 34 alphanumeric characters, as follows:

* country code using [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] – two letters, 
* [[check digit]]s – two digits, and 
* '''Basic Bank Account Number''' (BBAN) – up to 30 alphanumeric characters that are country-specific.&lt;ref name=IBANRegistry/&gt;

The check digits enable a [[Sanity testing|sanity check]] of the bank account number to confirm its integrity before submitting a transaction.

The IBAN should not contain spaces when transmitted electronically. When printed it is expressed in groups of four characters separated by a single space, the last group being of variable length as shown in the example below:&lt;ref name=IBANRegistry/&gt;

Permitted IBAN characters are the digits ''0'' to ''9'' and the 26 upper-case [[Latin alphabet|Latin alphabetic characters]] ''A'' to ''Z''.&lt;ref name=ValidationFeatures/&gt; This applies even in countries (e.g., Thailand) where these characters are not used in the national language.

===Basic Bank Account Number===
The Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN) format is decided by the national central bank or designated payment authority of each country. There is no consistency between the formats adopted. The national authority may register its BBAN format with SWIFT, but is not obliged to do so. It may adopt IBAN without registration. SWIFT also acts as the registration authority for the SWIFT system, which is used by most countries that have not adopted IBAN. A major difference between the two systems is that under SWIFT there is no requirement that BBANs used within a country be of a pre-defined length.

The BBAN must be of a fixed length for the country and comprise [[case sensitivity|case-insensitive]] alphanumeric characters. It includes the domestic bank account number, branch identifier, and potential routing information. Each country can have a different national routing/account numbering system, up to a maximum of 30 alphanumeric characters.

===Check digits===
The check digits enable the sending bank (or its customer) to perform a [[Sanity testing|sanity check]] of the routing destination and account number from a single string of data at the time of data entry.&lt;ref name=SIG203&gt;{{cite journal

Thus routing and account number errors are virtually eliminated.&lt;ref name=ValidationFeatures/&gt;

==Processing==
{{contradict|date=June 2016|about=the range of check digits. This section implies 00 to 96, the section below says 02 to 98.}}
One of the design aims of the IBAN was to enable as much validation as possible to be done at the point of data entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title = Handbook for the Standardisation and Application of Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN) and International Bank Account Number (IBAN) in Cyprus

* Country code
* Number of characters in the IBAN correspond to the number specified for the country code
* BBAN format specified for the country code
* Account number, bank code and country code combination is compatible with the check digits

The check digits are calculated using MOD-97-10 as per [[ISO 7064|ISO/IEC 7064:2003]]&lt;ref name=ValidationFeatures&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=31531 | title = ISO/IEC 7064:2003 – Information technology – Security techniques – Check character systems | publisher = International Organization for Standardization | accessdate = 31 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (abbreviated to ''mod-97'' in this article), which specifies a set of check character systems capable of protecting strings against errors which occur when people copy or key data. In particular, the standard states that the following can be detected:

* All single substitution errors (the substitution of a single character for another, for example &lt;tt&gt;4234&lt;/tt&gt; for &lt;tt&gt;1234&lt;/tt&gt;)
* All or nearly all single (local) transposition errors (the transposition of two single characters, either adjacent or with one character between them, for example &lt;tt&gt;12354&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;12543&lt;/tt&gt; for &lt;tt&gt;12345&lt;/tt&gt;)
* All or nearly all shift errors (shifts of the whole string to the left or right)
* High proportion of double substitution errors (two separate single substitution errors in the same string, for example &lt;tt&gt;7234587&lt;/tt&gt; for &lt;tt&gt;1234567&lt;/tt&gt;)
* High proportion of all other errors

The underlying rules for IBANs is that the account-servicing financial institution should issue an IBAN, as there are a number of areas where different IBANs could be generated from the same account and branch numbers that would satisfy the generic IBAN validation rules. In particular cases where &lt;tt&gt;00&lt;/tt&gt; is a valid check digit, &lt;tt&gt;97&lt;/tt&gt; will not be a valid check digit, likewise, if &lt;tt&gt;01&lt;/tt&gt; is a valid check digit, &lt;tt&gt;98&lt;/tt&gt; will not be a valid check digit, similarly with &lt;tt&gt;02&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;99&lt;/tt&gt;.

The [[UN CEFACT TBG5]] has published a free IBAN validation service in 32 languages for all 57 countries{{update inline|date=October 2016}} that have adopted the IBAN standard.&lt;ref name = IBANValidation&gt;{{cite web

===Algorithms===
{{anchor|algorithms}}

====Validating the IBAN====
An IBAN is validated by converting it into an [[integer]] and performing a basic ''mod-97'' operation (as described in [[ISO 7064]]) on it. If the IBAN is valid, the remainder equals 1.&lt;ref group='Note'&gt;In equations, the remainder of ''A'' divided by ''B'' is denoted {{nowrap|''A'' mod ''B'' or}} {{nowrap|''A'' (mod ''B'')}}, {{nowrap|e.g., 2 {{=}} 14 mod 12 .}} See [[Modular arithmetic#Remainders|Remainders]].&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm of IBAN validation is as follows:&lt;ref name=ECBS/&gt;

# Check that the total IBAN length is correct as per the country. If not, the IBAN is invalid
# Move the four initial characters to the end of the string
# Replace each letter in the string with two digits, thereby expanding the string, where A = 10, B = 11, ..., Z = 35
# Interpret the string as a decimal integer and compute the remainder of that number on division by 97

If the remainder is 1, the check digit test is passed and the IBAN might be valid.

Example (fictitious United Kingdom bank, sort code 12-34-56, account number 98765432):

:{|
|• IBAN: ||||align="right"|&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;GB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;82&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;WEST&lt;/span&gt; 1234 5698 7654 32||
|-
|• Rearrange: ||||align="right"|&lt;span style="color:green"&gt; W E S T&lt;/span&gt;12345698765432&lt;span style="color:red"&gt; G B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;82&lt;/span&gt;||
|-
|• Convert to integer: ||||align="right"|&lt;span style="color:green"&gt;32142829&lt;/span&gt;12345698765432&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;1611&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;82&lt;/span&gt;||
|-
|• Compute remainder: ||||align="right"|&lt;span style="color:green"&gt;32142829&lt;/span&gt;12345698765432&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;1611&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;82&lt;/span&gt;|| mod 97 = 1
|}

====Generating IBAN check digits====

According to the [[European Committee for Banking Standards|ECBS]] "generation of the IBAN SA1280000119608010928677 shall be the exclusive responsibility of the bank/branch servicing the account".&lt;ref name=ECBS/&gt; The ECBS document replicates part of the ISO/IEC 7064:2003 standard as a method for generating check digits in the range 02 to 98. Check digits in the ranges 00 to 96, 01 to 97, and 03 to 99 will also provide validation of an IBAN, but the standard is silent as to whether or not these ranges may be used.

The preferred algorithm is:&lt;ref name=ECBS/&gt;

# Check that the total IBAN length is correct as per the country. If not, the IBAN is invalid.
# Replace the two check digits by 00 (e.g., GB00 for the UK).
# Move the four initial characters to the end of the string.
# Replace the letters in the string with digits, expanding the string as necessary, such that A or a = 10, B or b = 11, and Z or z = 35. Each alphabetic character is therefore replaced by 2 digits&lt;!-- The range is 1 to 97, not 0 to 96, which is what generates the remainder of 1 above. --&gt;
# Convert the string to an integer (i.e. ignore leading zeroes).
# Calculate ''mod-97'' of the new number, which results in the remainder.
# Subtract the remainder from 98, and use the result for the two check digits. If the result is a single digit number, pad it with a leading 0 to make a two-digit number.

====Modulo operation on IBAN====
Any computer [[programming language]] or [[application software|software package]] that is used to compute ''D'' mod ''97'' directly must have the ability to handle [[integer]]s of more than 30 digits. In practice, this can only be done by software that either supports [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]] or that can handle 220 bit (unsigned) integers,&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The maximum length of ''D'' in (decimal) digits for the fully generic IBAN with 34 alphanumeric digits (two of which, the check digits, can, however, only be numeric) is {{nowrap|(34 − 2) × 2 + 2 × 1 {{=}} 66}}. 2&lt;sup&gt;220&lt;/sup&gt; is equal to 1.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;, from which it can be inferred that 220 bit unsigned integers can accommodate all unsigned integers of 66 digits. This is provided in [[C data types|C]] by a &lt;code&gt;long long long int&lt;/code&gt; on a typical modern computer with 32-bit &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/ref&gt; features that are often not standard. If the application software in use does not provide the ability to handle integers of this size, the [[modulo operation]] can be performed in a piece-wise manner (as is the case with the [[UN CEFACT TBG5]] Javascript program).

Piece-wise calculation {{nowrap|''D'' mod ''97''}} can be done in many ways. One such way is as follows:&lt;ref name='UKPayAdmin2007'&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.ukpayments.org.uk/files/standards/standard_48_iban_june_2007.pdf
 |title = Standard 48 – Format of the IBAN issued in the UK (International Bank Account Number)
 |publisher = UK Payments Administration
 |date = June 2016
 |accessdate = 20 August 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Starting from the leftmost digit of ''D'', construct a number using the first 9 digits and call it ''N''.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; is approximately equal to {{nowrap|2.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;}}, making it possible for any 9-digit integer to be handled using 32 bit integer arithmetic&lt;/ref&gt;
# Calculate ''N'' mod ''97''.
# Construct a new 9-digit ''N'' by concatenating above result (step 2) with the next 7 digits of ''D''. If there are fewer than 7 digits remaining in ''D'' but at least one, then construct a new ''N'', which will have less than 9 digits, from the above result (step 2) followed by the remaining digits of ''D''
# Repeat steps 2–3 until all the digits of ''D'' have been processed

The result of the final calculation in step 2 will be ''D'' mod 97 = ''N'' mod ''97''.

=====Example=====
In this example, the above algorithm for ''D'' mod 97 will be applied to ''D'' = &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;321428291&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:brown"&gt;2345698&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;7654321&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;61182&lt;/span&gt;. (The digits are colour-coded to aid the description below.) If the result is one, the IBAN corresponding to ''D'' passes the [[International Bank Account Number#Validating the IBAN|check digit test]].

# Construct ''N'' from the first 9 digits of D
#: ''N'' = &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;321428291&lt;/span&gt;
# Calculate ''N'' mod 97 = 70
# Construct a new 9-digit ''N'' from the above result (step 2) followed by the next 7 digits of ''D''. 
#:''N'' = 70&lt;span style="color:brown"&gt;2345698&lt;/span&gt;
# Calculate ''N'' mod 97 = 29
# Construct a new 9-digit ''N'' from the above result (step 4) followed by the next 7 digits of ''D''. 
#:''N'' = 29&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;7654321&lt;/span&gt;
# Calculate ''N'' mod 97 = 24
# Construct a new ''N'' from the above result (step 6) followed by the remaining 5 digits of ''D''. 
#:''N'' = 24&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;61182&lt;/span&gt;
# Calculate ''N'' mod 97 = 1

From step 8, the final result is ''D'' mod 97 = 1 and the IBAN has passed this check digit test.

International bank transactions use either an IBAN or the [[ISO 9362]] Business Identifier Code system ([[ISO 9362|BIC]] or [[SWIFT]] code) in conjunction with the BBAN (Basic Bank Account Number).

=== EEA and territories ===
The banks of most countries in [[Europe]] publish account numbers using both the IBAN format and the nationally recognised identifiers, this being mandatory within the [[European Economic Area]].&lt;ref name="924-2009"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32009R0924 | title = REGULATION (EC) No 924/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 16 September 2009 on cross-border payments in the Community and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 | publisher = [[EUR-Lex]] | accessdate = 2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day-to-day administration of banking in [[British Overseas Territories]] varies from territory to territory; some, such as [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]], have too small a population to warrant a banking system while others, such as [[Bermuda]], have a [[Bermuda Monetary Authority|thriving financial sector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Euro banknotes 2002.png|thumb|As of February 2014, the IBAN is mandatory for all banking transactions in countries that use the [[euro]].]]

====Single Euro Payments Area====
{{Main article|Single Euro Payments Area}}

The IBAN designation scheme was chosen as the foundation for electronic [[straight-through processing]] in the [[European Economic Area]]. The European Parliament mandated that a [[bank charge]] needs to be the same amount for domestic credit transfers as for cross-border credit transfers regulated in decision 2560/2001 (updated in 924/2009).&lt;ref name="924-2009" /&gt; This regulation took effect in 2003. Only payments in euro up to €12,500 to a bank account designated by its IBAN were covered by the regulation.

The Euro Payments regulation has been the foundation for the decision to create a [[Single Euro Payments Area]] (SEPA). The [[European Central Bank]] has created the [[TARGET2]] interbank network that unifies the technical infrastructure of the 26 central banks of the European Union (although Sweden and the UK have opted out). SEPA is a self-regulatory initiative by the banking sector of Europe as represented in the [[European Payments Council]] (EPC). The European Union made the scheme mandatory through the [[Payment Services Directive]] published in 2007. Since January 2008, all countries must support SEPA credit transfer, and SEPA direct debit must be supported since November 2009. The regulation on SEPA payments increases the charge cap (same price for domestic payments as for cross-border payments) to €50,000.

With a further decision of the European Parliament, the IBAN scheme for bank accounts fully replaced the domestic numbering schemes from 31 December 2012.&lt;ref name="dowjones2010"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dowjones.de/site/2010/12/frist-f%C3%BCr-umstieg-auf-sepa-produkte-deutscher-widerstand-programmiert.html | title = Frist für Umstieg auf SEPA-Produkte: Dt Widerstand programmiert | language = German | trans-title = Deadline for migration to SEPA products: Dt programmed resistance | publisher = Dow Jones Deutschland | date = 14 December 2010 | accessdate = 18 December 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101217080334/http://www.dowjones.de/site/2010/12/frist-f%C3%BCr-umstieg-auf-sepa-produkte-deutscher-widerstand-programmiert.html | archivedate = 17 December 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 December 2010, the European Commission published proposed regulations that will make IBAN support mandatory for domestic credit transfer by 2013 and for domestic direct debit by 2014 (with a 12 and 24 months transition period respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52010PC0775:EN:NOT | title = Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing technical requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euros and amending Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 | date = 16 December 2010 | publisher = the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union | accessdate = 17 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries have already replaced their traditional bank account scheme by IBAN. This includes Switzerland where IBAN was introduced for national credit transfer on 1 January 2006 and the support for the old bank account numbers has not been required from 1 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ktipp.ch/themen/beitrag/1041577/IBAN-Nummer_Noch_kein_Obligatorium | title = IBAN-Nummer: Noch kein Obligatorium |trans-title=IBAN Number: Not mandatory | date = 29 November 2009 | language = German | accessdate = 18 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a 20 December 2011 memorandum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/11/935&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en|title=Commissioner Michel Barnier welcomes agreement by Council and Parliament establishing SEPA migration end-dates|id=MEMO/11/935|date=20 December 2010|publisher=European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; the EU parliament resolved the mandatory dates for the adoption of the IBAN on 14 February 2012.&lt;ref name="iban-required"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2012-0037+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN#BKMD-9|title=European Parliament legislative resolution of 14 February 2012 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing technical requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euros and amending Regulation (EC) No 924/2009|id=P7_TA-PROV(2012)0037|date=14 February 2012|publisher=European Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1 February 2014, all national systems for credit transfer and direct debit must be abolished and replaced by an IBAN-based system.&lt;ref name="iban-required" /&gt; This will be extended to all cross-border SEPA transactions from 1 February 2016 (Article 5 Section 7).&lt;ref name="iban-required" /&gt; After these dates the IBAN will be sufficient to identify an account for home and foreign financial transactions in SEPA countries and banks will no longer be permitted to require that the customer supply the BIC for the beneficiary's bank.

In the run-up to the 1 February 2014 deadline, it became apparent that many old bank account numbers had not been allocated IBANs&amp;mdash;an issue that has to be addressed on a country-by-country basis. In Germany, for example, [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] and the [[German Banking Industry Committee]] require that all holders of German bank codes ("Bankleitzahl") publish the specifics of their IBAN generation format taking into account not only the generation of check digits but also the handling of legacy bank codes, thereby enabling third parties to generate IBANs independently of the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Non-EEA===
Banks in numerous non-European countries including most states of the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Caribbean]] have implemented the IBAN format for account identification.&lt;ref name=IBANRegistry/&gt; In some countries the IBAN is used on an ''ad hoc'' basis, an example being [[Ukraine]] where account numbers used for international transfers of four of the national banks have additional aliases that follow the IBAN format as a precursor to formal SWIFT registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The degree to which bank verifies the validity of a recipient's bank account number depends of the configuration of the transmitting bank's software&amp;mdash;many major software packages supply bank account validation as a standard function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Non-European banks usually accept IBANs for accounts in Europe, although they might not treat IBANs differently from other foreign bank account numbers. In particular, they might not check the IBAN's validity prior to sending the transfer.&lt;ref name=BankersAccuity&gt;{{cite web

Banks in the [[United States]] do not use IBAN as account numbers for U.S. accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Canadian financial institutions have not adopted IBAN and use [[routing number (Canada)|routing numbers]] issued by [[Payments Canada]] for domestic transfers, and SWIFT for international transfers. There is no formal governmental or private sector regulatory requirement in Canada for the major banks to use IBAN.

[[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] do not use IBAN. They use [[Bank State Branch]] codes for domestic transfers and SWIFT for international transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== IBAN formats by country ===
This table summarises the IBAN formats by country:&lt;ref name=IBANRegistry&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.swift.com/sites/default/files/resources/swift_standards_ibanregistry.pdf | title = IBAN registry – This registry provides detailed information about all ISO 13616-compliant national IBAN formats – Release 63 |date= February 2016 | publisher = SWIFT | accessdate = 15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ''kk'' after the two-character ISO country code represents the check digits calculated from the rest of the IBAN characters. If it is a constant for the country concerned, this will be stated in the Comments column. This happens where the BBAN has its own check digits that use the same algorithm as the IBAN check digits
* The BBAN format column shows the format of the BBAN part of an IBAN in terms of upper case alpha characters (A–Z) denoted by "a", numeric characters (0–9) denoted by "n" and mixed case alphanumeric characters (a–z, A–Z, 0–9) denoted by "c". For example, the Bulgarian BBAN (4a,6n,8c) consists of 4 alpha characters, followed by 6 numeric characters, then by 8 mixed-case alpha-numeric characters
* Descriptions in the ''Comments'' field have been standardised with country specific names in brackets. The format of the various fields can be deduced from the BBAN field
*Countries that are planning to introduce the IBAN are shown in ''italics'' with the planned date of introduction in '''bold'''

== Criticism ==

There is criticism about the length and readability of IBAN. Printed on paper the IBAN is often difficult to read. Therefore, it is popular to group the IBAN with four symbols. However, for electronic documents (e.g. PDF invoice) the copy and paste of grouped IBAN can result in errors with online banking forms. Only a few {{CitationNeeded|date=January 2016}} user friendly bank institutes allow and detect the copy and paste of both grouped and ungrouped IBAN.

==History==
[[File:Ipswich Railway Station 1865.jpg|thumb|Ipswich Railway Station in 1865|left]]

===Early history===
Prior to the arrival of European settlers, what is now called Ipswich was home to many indigenous language groups, including the Warpai tribe,&lt;ref&gt;Tom Petrie's Reminiscences of Early Queensland. St Lucia, Queensland: University of Queensland Press. 1992. p. 102. {{ISBN|0702223832}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yuggera and [[Ugarapul]] [[Indigenous Australian]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipswich150.com.au/proud_past |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706105041/http://www.ipswich150.com.au/proud_past/ |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was first explored by European colonists in 1826, when Captain [[Patrick Logan]], Commandant of the [[Moreton Bay]] penal colony, sailed up the [[Brisbane River]] and discovered large deposits of [[limestone]] and other minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Extract from Captain Patrick Logans' Journal – [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2188791 The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser (NSW : 1803–1842)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settlement===
[[File:Lands Office, Ipswich, erected 1877.jpg|left|thumb|Lands Office, erected 1877]]
The town began in 1827 as a limestone mining settlement and grew rapidly as a major inland port. Ipswich was initially named "The Limestone Hills" and later shortened to "Limestone", however in 1843 it was renamed after the town of [[Ipswich]] in England.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite QPN|16769|Ipswich|access-date=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population was 932 in 1851 and had risen to 2459 by 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knight|first=J.J.|title=Brisbane : a historical sketch of the capital of Queensland, giving an outline of old-time events, with a description of Brisbane of the present day, and a municipal retrospect|url=http://www.textqueensland.com.au/item/book/0136505eaa51dbcc3c0c68770bef1ef4|publisher=Biggs &amp; Morcom|access-date=|page=24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026111108/http://www.textqueensland.com.au/item/book/0136505eaa51dbcc3c0c68770bef1ef4|archivedate=26 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a municipality in 1858. Ipswich was a prime candidate for becoming the capital of Queensland, but Brisbane was instead chosen in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite QHR|20499|Ipswich Town Wharves|602567|access-date=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proclaimed a city in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipswich.qld.gov.au/about_council/council_history/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518194944/http://www.ipswich.qld.gov.au/about_council/council_history/index.php |archivedate=18 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city became a major coal-mining area in the early 19th Century, contributing to the development of railways in the region as a means of transport. The first recorded coal mines in the central Ipswich area started at Woodend in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipswich.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/9811/mining.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323132244/http://www.ipswich.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/9811/mining.pdf |archivedate=23 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1840s onward, Ipswich was becoming an important river port for growing local industries such as coal and wool from the [[Darling Downs]] and a regular paddlesteamer service from Brisbane Town, ''The Experiment'', was established in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;The Steamer "Experiment" – [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page540269 The Moreton Bay Courier – 20 June 1846]&lt;/ref&gt; This, and other steamer services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipswich.qld.gov.au/documents/heritage/education_kit_transport.pdf|title=Ipswich City Council – Heritage Education Kit – Transport|publisher=|access-date=3 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225124358/http://www.ipswich.qld.gov.au/documents/heritage/education_kit_transport.pdf|archivedate=25 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; remained the primary form of [[Bulk transport|mass/bulk transport]] between the two cities until 1876, when the construction of the original [[Albert Bridge, Brisbane|Albert Bridge]], spanning the Brisbane River at [[Indooroopilly]], completed the railway line begun between Ipswich and Brisbane in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.qr.com.au/stories/|title=Queensland Rail – Queensland's First Railway|publisher=|access-date=3 June 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929210335/http://www.history.qr.com.au/stories/|archivedate=29 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ipswich was proclaimed a municipality on 2 March 1860 and became a [[city of Ipswich|city]] in 1904.

He was a [[Burgess (title)|burgess]] for [[Northumberland County, Virginia|Northumberland County]] and a [[councilor]] of [[Virginia]].

==Biography==

===Early life and ancestors===
He was born in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]], sometime after May 22, 1627 and before September 21, 1631; however, no birth record has been found for him.&lt;ref name="Jones24-26"&gt;Jones, pp. 24-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merrick30"&gt;Merrick, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allerton30"&gt;Allerton, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of [[Mayflower]] [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrim]] [[Isaac Allerton|Isaac Allerton Sr.]]&lt;ref name="Jones24-26"&gt;Jones, pp. 24-26&lt;/ref&gt; and his second wife [[Fear Brewster]],&lt;ref name="Jones24-26"&gt;Jones, pp. 24-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allerton19"&gt;Allerton, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allerton29"&gt;Allerton, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merrick12"&gt;Merrick, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of Elder [[William Brewster (Pilgrim)|William Brewster]],&lt;ref name=Merrick1&gt;Merrick, 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Merrick2&gt;Merrick, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Merrick3&gt;Merrick, 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Merrick4&gt;Merrick, 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Merrick5&gt;Merrick, 5&lt;/ref&gt; the Pilgrim colonist leader and spiritual elder of the [[Plymouth Colony]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and passenger aboard the [[Mayflower]] and one of the signers of the [[Mayflower Compact]]; and [[Mary Brewster]]. Fear arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts on July 10, 1623 aboard the Anne. Fear died sometime before December 12, 1634. His father had been married first to Mary Norris who died on February 25, 1621. He had 3 half-siblings: Bartholomew, Remember and [[Mary Allerton|Mary]], the last surviving passenger of the ''[[Mayflower]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Mayflower History
|url=http://www.mayflowerhistory.com/Passengers/MaryAllerton.php# }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Fear's death, he moved to the [[New Haven Colony]], and by 1644 had remarried to his third wife, Joanna [[Swinnerton]].

Because of the general ire of the Plymouth Colony against his father, he had moved to the New Haven Colony. As a result of the upheavals of losing his mother and his father moving away, the young Allerton became a member of the extended family of his grandfather William Brewster and eventually joined the family of his uncle [[Love Brewster]].

His aunt Sarah Allerton was married to [[Degory Priest]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was a signer of the [[Mayflower Compact]], and one of the original 102 [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] who arrived on the ''[[Mayflower]]'' to [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]] in 1620. Sarah did not travel aboard the ''Mayflower''; she arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts on July 10, 1623 aboard the ''Anne''.

===Education===
He was tutored by his grandfather Brewster prior to entering college.&lt;ref name="Jones38-39"&gt;Jones, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Harvard College]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in 1650.&lt;ref name="Allerton31"&gt;Allerton, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sibley531"&gt;Sibley, p. 531&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and family===
Allerton married, as his first wife, Elizabeth (...) in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] in 1652/3.&lt;ref name="Jones38-39"&gt;Jones, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children, Elizabeth (1653–1740) and Isaac (1655-?).&lt;ref name="Allerton34"&gt;Allerton, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; When his wife Elizabeth died circa 1660, he moved his family to Northumberland County, in Virginia's [[Northern Neck]]. Initially he settled in [[Wicomico, Virginia|Wicomico]] at the far eastern end of the county on land adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay and in the vicinity of the plantation of [[Richard Lee II|Col. Richard Lee II]]. His daughter, Elizabeth, was born on September 27, 1653&lt;ref name="Allerton34"&gt;Allerton, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. She subsequently married Benjamin Starr, who was born in [[Yarmouth, Massachusetts]], the grandson of Doctor [[Comfort Starr]] of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] (who emigrated from [[Ashford, Kent]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hul.harvard.edu/huarc/charter.html Harvard Charter of 1650, Harvard University Archives, harvard.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; and founded [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and [[Harvard College]]) and nephew of Hannah Starr, the wife of [[John Cutt]] (the first President of the [[Province of New Hampshire]]). Following Starr's early death, Elizabeth married his first cousin Simon Ayers/Eyres/Eyre of New Haven.&lt;ref name="Merrick102"&gt;Merrick, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PDkPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=%22comfort+starr%22+allerton&amp;ei=wKkESZuPOpzitAOAkpm4DA A Genealogical Dictionary of the First Settlers of New England, Vol. II, James Savage, John Farmer, Orrando Perry Dexter, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1860]&lt;/ref&gt;

His son Isaac (the third of the name) was born at New Haven on June 11, 1655. He accompanied his father to Virginia when he was a child, but returned to New Haven about 1683 and lived there most of the remainder of his life.&lt;ref name="Jones38-39"&gt;Jones, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

(The following marriage and children information is no longer accepted by the General Society of Mayflower Descendants; see ''Mayflower Families Through Five Generations'' (Vol. 17: Issac Allerton) by Robert S. Wakefield and Margaret Harris Stover.) In 1663, Allerton married as his second wife the twice-widowed Elizabeth Willoughby (Overzee) Colclough.&lt;ref name="Jones38-39"&gt;Jones, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Billings112-115"&gt;Billings, pp. 112-115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allerton32-33"&gt;Allerton, pp. 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; They had three children:&lt;ref name="Allerton34"&gt;Allerton, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Willoughby&lt;ref name="Merrick103"&gt;Merrick, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; (b. ca. 1664), Frances&lt;ref name="Merrick105"&gt;Merrick, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; (b. ca. 1668), and Sarah&lt;ref name="Merrick107"&gt;Merrick, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; (1670–1731). As a tobacco planter-merchant Allerton probably constructed a wharf and warehouse (as his father had done in New Amsterdam) since financial success required both growing and transporting tobacco. Whether Allerton bought land from his neighbor Richard Lee II or acquired it over time is not known. He may have acquired the land from his marriage to Elizabeth, who would have acquired it from her previous marriages or from her parents.

In any event, Allerton's family became wealthy, with indentured servants, and owned a {{convert|2150|acre|km2|adj=on}} plantation on the south side of the [[Rappahannock River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quitt|first1=Martin H.|title=Isaac Allerton (ca. 1630–1702)|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Allerton_Isaac_ca_1630-1702|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Virginia]]|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1688, he along with Captain George Brent of [[Stafford County, Virginia]] (former [[Governor of Maryland]]) and Captain [[Lawrence Washington (1659–1698)|Lawrence Washington]] were named by their friend, [[Nicholas Spencer|Col. Nicholas Spencer Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;On record in Westmoreland County is a February 4, 1661, power-of-attorney from merchant Gabriel Reve of London to "Lawrence Washington, of Luton, County Bedford, merchant" asking for payment from Captain Nathaniel Pope's heirs for all sums due to London merchant Reve. Undoubtedly Lawrence Washington of Bedfordshire and Nicholas Spencer were known to each other in England.[https://books.google.com/books?id=uDoSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=%22nicholas+spencer%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=IgI9G5E_29&amp;sig=j45SgbLsBs0Y9mhH38Hkb30fLmo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA33,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; to serve as trustees of his estates.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Washington and Allerton had been involved in an episode in Maryland involving the Pascatoway Indians in 1675.[https://books.google.com/books?id=4SYUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=%22nicholas+spencer%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=Df4DSdekHIXWsgOcz7WdDA]&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Washington, named by Spencer as a trustee, was the younger brother of Lieutenant Colonel John Washington and was born in 1635. The trustees named by Colonel Spencer in his will received forty shillings for [[mourning ring]]s.

===Career===
In 1663 Allerton was a justice of Northumberland County. In 1667 he was a member of the "Committee of the Association of Northumberland, Westmoreland and Stafford Counties". He became a member of the Virginia militia and ultimately rose to the rank of colonel.&lt;ref name="Allerton32-33"&gt;Allerton, pp. 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; As a major in 1667, he served under Colonel [[John Washington]], the great-grandfather of president [[George Washington]],&lt;ref name="Jones38-39"&gt;Jones, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; in order to subdue Susquehannock and Doeg Indians, who were raiding settlements. Allerton served as justice of the peace and member of the House of Burgesses in 1676-77. During [[Bacon's Rebellion]] Allerton was a member of the House of Burgesses but remained loyal to the governor. Allerton's family developed a close relationship with Lee's family. Both Allerton and Lee were senior officers in the [[Virginia militia]] and both served as members of the General Court of Virginia. Records of the region indicate that Allerton and Lee participated in commerce, governmental affairs and social activities. In 1691 Allerton, Lee and John Armistead refused to take the oath recognizing [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] as England's rightful rulers.&lt;ref name="Jones38-39"&gt;Jones, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee's younger brother [[Hancock Lee|Hancock]] (1652–1709)&lt;ref name="Lee518-531"&gt;Lee, pp. 518-531&lt;/ref&gt; married Allerton's daughter Sarah (1670–1731) following the death of Hancock's first wife. They became the great-grandparents of President [[Zachary Taylor]],&lt;ref name=Jones251&gt;Jones, 251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones252&gt;Jones, 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones253&gt;Jones, 253&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/1023 Zachary Taylor] at [[Find A Grave]]&lt;/ref&gt; through their daughter Elizabeth Lee and grandson Colonel [[Richard Taylor (colonel)|Richard Taylor]], an officer in the [[Continental Army]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name="Jones38-39"&gt;Jones, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;  Another great granddaughter was Mary Willis Lee&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/33010094 Mary Willis Lee Madison] at [[Find A Grave]]&lt;/ref&gt; (1757–1798), the daughter of Hancock Lee II (1709-1762) and Mary Willis&lt;ref name="Lee518-531"&gt;Lee, pp. 518-531&lt;/ref&gt; (1716–1766). She married Ambrose Madison&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=madison&amp;GSfn=Ambrose+&amp;GSbyrel=in&amp;GSdyrel=in&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=33009991&amp; Ambrose Madison] at [[Find A Grave]]&lt;/ref&gt; (1755–1793). He was the son of [[James Madison, Sr.]], the owner of a tobacco plantation in [[Orange County, Virginia]]; and the brother of [[James Madison]]&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=M000043|title=Madison, James Jr., (1751–1836)|work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|publisher=US Congress|accessdate=2009-08-24}}, {{cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/convention/delegates/madison.html|title=James Madison Jr. |publisher=teachingamericanhistory.org|accessdate=2009-08-24}} and {{cite web|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/madison_james.html|title=Madison, James Jr.,|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (March 16, 1751&amp;nbsp;– June 28, 1836) an American [[politician]] and [[political philosopher]] who served as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|fourth]] [[President of the United States]] (1809–1817) and is considered one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].

===Death===
He died between October 25, 1702 and December 30, 1702 in Westmoreland County, Virginia.&lt;ref name="Jones38-39"&gt;Jones, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allerton32-33"&gt;Allerton, pp. 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4739">'''JetForm''' was the name of a Canadian software manufacturer created by four consultants (Wayne Hall, Bob Allum, Tom Hicks, and John Gleed) that was based out of [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] and an electronic form software product of the same name.

JetForm once had major offices in the [[United States]], various countries in Europe, [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]. It was founded in 1982, and was listed under [[NASDAQ]] as FORMF, under the [[Pacific Stock Exchange]] as JTF, and the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] as JFM.

==History==
The company was originally named Indigo Software and was solely a software consulting firm. Indigo Software did work for the [[Government of Canada|Canadian Federal Government]] and [[IBM]] (as the maintainer of an IBM CAD software product); among other clients.  One significant government project resulted in an electronic forms product being created: iFiller, iPrint, et al.

With [[Microsoft]]'s release of [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.11]], Indigo Software did a major enhancement to the forms software and re-branded it JetForm.  The JetForm forms product was very successful, and Indigo Software's consulting work also began to focus on work associated with the JetForm software. Given the popularity of the forms software, Indigo Software made a decision to rename the company JetForm.

Its [[eponym]]ous series of products directly competed against other electronic forms software, such as [[Delrina]]'s [[PerForm]], and [[FormFlow]] products.

In September, 1996, [[Symantec]], which had bought Delrina the previous year, sold their Electronic Forms Division to JetForm. JetForm continued to develop the FormFlow series of products under its own name.

Around this time, JetForm bought the [[naming rights]] to the [[Ottawa Baseball Stadium]], naming it "JetForm Park".

On September 13, 2001, JetForm changed its name to Accelio. Accelio was acquired by [[Adobe Systems]] in February 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200202/200202accelioacq.html | title=Accelio acquisition press release | accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The electronic forms products were officially retired in 2004. Adobe marketed JetForm as Adobe Central Output Server [http://www.adobe.com/products/server/outputserver/], without any major changes. Adobe's successor for the JetForm technology was released June 7, 2007, as Adobe LiveCycle Enterprise Suite (ES)[http://www.adobe.com/products/livecycle/], part of the [[Adobe LiveCycle]] suite. The product was renamed again in April 9, 2009 to Adobe Central / Central Pro Output Server and reached its end of [https://www.adobe.com/support/products/enterprise/eol/eol_matrix.html#6 Extended Support] on June 30, 2016.  

JetForm Rises Again, In 2007 two of the original founders Tom Hicks, Wayne Hall and four of the core software developers of JetForm Central came together to build a new enterprise class document designer, merge engine, presentation and delivery system. The software is called DocOrigin (a play off the Origin of Documents). DocOrigin was first released in 2009 and in 2013 version 3.0 was released.

==JetForm Software==

'''JetForm Design''' allowed for routing and tracking in workflow systems, on-screen form creation, and access to [[SQL]] and [[ODBC]]-compliant databases. '''JetForm Filler''' was used for completing on-screen forms. JetForm also developed the XML form format [https://web.archive.org/web/20091223030550/http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/xml/index_arch.html "XFA"], which was later adopted by Adobe into its PDF software.

One of the Indigo Forms software's innovations when it was introduced was its ability to have its forms installed into Laserjet font cartridges. This meant that the product only had to send forms data to the printer; since the form was already encoded in the font cartridge. Given the slow printer interfaces used at that time, this greatly reduced print times.

'''John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr.''' (November 25, 1960 – July 16, 1999), often referred to as '''JFK Jr.''' or '''John John''', was an American lawyer, journalist, and magazine publisher. He was a son of President [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Jacqueline Kennedy]], and a younger brother of former [[U.S. Ambassador to Japan|Ambassador to Japan]] [[Caroline Kennedy]]. His father [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|was assassinated]] three days before his third birthday.

From his early childhood years at the [[White House]], Kennedy was the subject of great media scrutiny, and he became a popular social figure in [[Manhattan]]. Trained as a lawyer, Kennedy worked as a New York City Assistant District Attorney for almost four years. In 1995, he launched ''[[George (magazine)|George]]'' magazine, using his political and celebrity status to publicize it. Kennedy [[John F. Kennedy Jr. plane crash|died in a plane crash]] in 1999.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Two JFKs.jpg|thumb|left|upright|JFK Jr. with [[John F. Kennedy|his father]] at the [[White House]] at age two]]
John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. was born at [[Georgetown University Hospital]] on November 25, 1960, two weeks after his father was [[United States presidential election, 1960|elected president]]. His parents had a stillborn daughter named Arabella four years before John Jr.'s birth. John Jr. had an older sister, [[Caroline Kennedy|Caroline]], and a younger brother, [[Patrick Bouvier Kennedy|Patrick]], who died two days after his premature birth in 1963. His putative nickname, "John-John", came from a reporter who misheard JFK calling him "John" twice in quick succession; the name was not used by his family.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/interactive/specials/9912/yearinreview.passages/content/politics/kennedy.html Kennedy Year in Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513233029/http://www.cnn.com/interactive/specials/9912/yearinreview.passages/content/politics/kennedy.html |date=2006-05-13 }} [[CNN]].&lt;/ref&gt;

John Jr. lived in the [[White House]] during the first three years of his life and later remained in the public spotlight up until his death. His father was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] on November 22, 1963, and the [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|state funeral]] was held three days later, on John Jr.'s third birthday. In a moment that became an iconic image of the 1960s, John Jr. stepped forward and rendered a final salute as his father's flag-draped casket was carried out from [[Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle|St. Matthew's Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="FamousPictures"&gt;{{cite web |date=2007-07-22|url = http://www.famouspictures.org/jfk-jr-salutes-jfk/|title = Famous Pictures Magazine – JFK Jr salutes JFK|publisher = Famous Pictures Magazine|accessdate = 2013-05-21 |last=Lucas|first=Dean}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family continued with their plans for a birthday party to demonstrate that the Kennedys would go on despite the death of the President.&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy attended private schools in Manhattan, starting at [[Saint David's School (New York City)|Saint David's School]] and moving to [[Collegiate School (New York)|Collegiate School]], which he attended from third through tenth grade.&lt;ref name=Heymann145146 /&gt; He completed high school at [[Phillips Academy|Phillips Academy Andover]], Massachusetts. After graduating, he went to [[Brown University]] where he majored in American studies.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, pp. 236-237.&lt;/ref&gt; There, he co-founded a student discussion group that focused on contemporary issues such as [[apartheid]] in South Africa, gun control, and civil rights. Visiting South Africa during a summer break, he was appalled by apartheid, and arranged for U.N. Ambassador [[Andrew Young]] to speak about the topic at Brown.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

By his junior year at Brown, he had moved off campus to live with several other students in a shared house,&lt;ref&gt;Landau, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; and spent time at Xenon, a club owned by [[Howard Stein]]. Kennedy was initiated into Phi Psi, a local social fraternity that had been the Rhode Island Alpha Chapter of national [[Phi Kappa Psi]] fraternity until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Robert T. Littell, ''The Men We Became: My Friendship With John F. Kennedy, Jr.'' (St. Martin's Press 2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8lfKFx22v7UC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Kennedy+%22Phi+Psi%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uCl7TvDWGeP50gHri_3kAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Phi%20Psi%22&amp;f=false passim].&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1983 with a bachelor's degree in American studies, and then took a break from work, traveling to India and spending some time at the [[University of Delhi]], where he met [[Mother Teresa]]. He also worked with some of the Kennedy special interest projects, including the East Harlem School at Exodus House and Reaching Up.

===Mother's remarriage===
After President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Mrs. Kennedy moved her family to a luxury apartment on the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] in New York City, where Kennedy Jr. grew up. In 1967, his mother took him and  Caroline on a six-week "sentimental journey" to Ireland, where they met [[President of Ireland|President]] [[Éamon de Valera]] and visited the Kennedy ancestral home in  Dunganstown.&lt;ref name=Heymann145146&gt;Heymann, pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his uncle [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert was assassinated]] in 1968, his mother took him and his sister out of the United States, saying: "If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets&amp;nbsp;... I want to get out of this country."&lt;ref name="NYT obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/19/us/john-f-kennedy-jr-heir-to-a-formidable-dynasty.html?pagewanted=all|title=John F. Kennedy Jr., Heir to a Formidable Dynasty| author = Seely, Katherine|date=July 19, 1999|work=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=November 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, she married Greek shipping tycoon [[Aristotle Onassis]], and the family went to live on his private island of [[Skorpios]]. Kennedy is said to have considered his stepfather "a joke".&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 690.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Kennedy returned to the White House with his mother and sister for the first time since the assassination. President [[Richard Nixon]]'s daughters gave Kennedy a tour that included his old bedroom, and Nixon showed him the [[Resolute desk|''Resolute'' desk]] under which his father had let him play. When Onassis died in 1975, he left Kennedy $25,000, though Jacqueline was able to renegotiate the will, and acquired $20 million for herself and her children.&lt;ref name=BaltimoreSun&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-07-18/news/9907180015_1_barlow-john-fitzgerald-kennedy-jacqueline-kennedy-onassis/2|title=A life lived in celebrity|work=Baltimore Sun|first=Scott|last=Shane|date=July 18, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Kennedy and his cousin visited an earthquake disaster zone at [[Rabinal]] in Guatemala, helping with heavy building work and distributing food. The local priest said that they "ate what the people of Rabinal ate and dressed in Guatemalan clothes and slept in tents like most of the earthquake victims", adding that the two "did more for their country's image" in Guatemala "than a roomful of ambassadors".&lt;ref name=Leigh195&gt;Leigh, pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt; On his sixteenth birthday, Kennedy's Secret Service protection ended &lt;ref name=Leigh137&gt;Leigh, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; and he spent the summer of 1978 working as a wrangler in Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before attending [[Brown University]], Kennedy accompanied his mother to Africa. On a pioneering course, he rescued his group, which had gotten lost for two days without food or water, and won points for leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the [[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum]] was dedicated, and Kennedy made his first major speech, reciting [[Stephen Spender]]'s poem "I Think Continually of Those Who Were Truly Great".&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After the 1984 Democratic Convention in San Francisco, Kennedy returned to New York and earned $20,000 a year in a position at the Office of Business Development, where his boss reflected that he worked "in the same crummy cubbyhole as everybody else. I heaped on the work and was always pleased."&lt;ref name=mgross.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mgross.com/writing/profiles/jfk1/|title=Favorite Son|date=March 20, 1989|publisher=New York Magazine|first=Michael|last=Gross}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1984 to 1986, he worked for the New York City Office of Business Development and served as deputy director of the 42nd Street Development Corporation in 1986,&lt;ref name=Bly279/&gt; conducting negotiations with developers and city agencies. In 1988, he became a summer associate at Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg &amp; Phillips, a Los Angeles law firm with strong connections to the Democratic Party. There, Kennedy worked for Charlie Manatt, his uncle [[Ted Kennedy]]'s law school roommate.&lt;ref name=mgross.com/&gt;

From 1989, Kennedy headed Reaching Up, a nonprofit group which provided educational and other opportunities for workers who helped people with disabilities. William Ebenstein, executive director of Reaching Up, said, "He was always concerned with the working poor, and his family always had an interest in helping them."

In 1989, Kennedy earned a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from the [[New York University School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heymann|first=Clemens David |title=American Legacy: The Story of John &amp; Caroline Kennedy|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2007|pages=323|isbn=0-7434-9738-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then failed the New York [[bar exam]] twice, before passing on his third try in July 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blow|first=Richard |author2=Bradley, Richard|title=American Son: A Portrait of John F. Kennedy, Jr.|publisher=Macmillan|year=2002|pages=17|isbn=0-312-98899-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failing the exam for a second time, Kennedy vowed that he would take it continuously until he was ninety-five years old or passed.&lt;ref name=desertnews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/99874/JOHN-KENNEDY-JR-FAILS-BAR-EXAM-2ND-TIME-SAYS-HELL-TAKE-IT-AGAIN.html?pg=all|title=JOHN KENNEDY JR.

In the summer of 1992, he worked as a journalist and was commissioned by ''[[The New York Times]]'' to write an article about his kayaking expedition to the Åland Archipelago, where he saved one of his friends from the water when his kayak capsized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Good Son: JFK Jr. and the Mother He Loved|first=Christopher|last=Andersen|year=2014|pages=266–267.|publisher=Gallery Books|isbn=978-1476775562}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then considered creating a magazine with his friend, public-relations magnate [[Michael J. Berman]] – a plan which his mother thought too risky. In his 2000 book ''The Day John Died'', Christopher Andersen wrote that Jacqueline had also worried that her son would die in a plane crash, and asked her longtime companion [[Maurice Tempelsman]] "to do whatever it took to keep John from becoming a pilot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=91891&amp;page=1|title=Book: JFK. Jr's Death Foretold|date=July 11, 2000 &lt;!-- year per pub date of "new" book mentioned in source --&gt;|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting===
Meanwhile, Kennedy had done a bit of acting, which was one of his passions (he had appeared in many plays while at Brown). He expressed interest in acting as a career, but his mother strongly disapproved of it as an unsuitable profession.&lt;ref name="A&amp;E Biography"&gt;A&amp;E Biography&lt;/ref&gt; On August 4, 1985, Kennedy made his New York acting debut in front of an invitation-only audience at the Irish Theater on Manhattan's West Side. Executive director of the Irish Arts Center, Nye Heron, said that Kennedy was "one of the best young actors I've seen in years".&lt;ref name=Bly279&gt;Bly, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy's director, Robin Saex, stated, "He has an earnestness that just shines through." Kennedy's largest acting role was playing a fictionalized version of himself in the season-eight episode of the sitcom ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', called "Altered States". In this episode, Kennedy visits Brown at her office, in order to promote a magazine he is publishing.

===''George'' magazine===
In 1995, Kennedy and Michael Berman founded ''[[George (magazine)|George]]'', a glossy, politics-as-lifestyle and fashion monthly, with Kennedy controlling 50 percent of the shares.&lt;ref name="A&amp;E Biography"/&gt;  Kennedy officially launched the magazine at a news conference in Manhattan on September 8, and joked that he had not seen so many reporters in one place since he failed his first bar exam.&lt;ref name=Landau117 /&gt;

Each issue of the magazine contained an editor's column and interviews written by Kennedy,&lt;ref name=Sumner&gt;{{cite book|last=Sumner|first=David E.|title=The Magazine Century: American Magazines Since 1900|publisher=Peter Lang International Academic Publishers|year=2010|pages=201|isbn=978-1433104930}}&lt;/ref&gt; who believed they could make politics "accessible by covering it in an entertaining and compelling way" which would allow "popular interest and involvement" to follow.&lt;ref name=Landau100-102 /&gt; Kennedy did interviews with [[Louis Farrakhan]], [[Billy Graham]], [[Garth Brooks]], and others.&lt;ref name=Landau100-102&gt;Landau, pp. 100-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue was criticized for its image of [[Cindy Crawford]] posing as [[George Washington]] in a powdered wig and ruffled shirt. In defense of the cover, Kennedy stated that "political magazines should look like Mirabella."&lt;ref name=Landau99&gt;Landau, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1997, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' had published a profile of Mayor of New York City [[Rudy Giuliani]] claiming that the mayor was sleeping with his press secretary (which both parties denied). Although tempted to follow up on this story, Kennedy decided against it.&lt;ref&gt;Blow, pp. 174-175.&lt;/ref&gt;
The same month, Kennedy wrote about meeting [[Mother Teresa]], declaring that the "three days I spent in her presence was the strongest evidence this struggling Catholic has ever had that God exists."&lt;ref name=Sumner/&gt;

The September 1997 issue of ''George'' centered on temptation, and featured two of Kennedy's cousins, [[Michael LeMoyne Kennedy]] and [[Joseph P. Kennedy II]]. Michael had been accused of having an affair with his children's underaged babysitter, while Joe had been accused by his ex-wife of having bullied her. John declared that both his cousins had become "poster boys for bad behaviour"  –  believed to be the first time a member of the Kennedy family had publicly attacked another Kennedy. He said he was trying to show that press coverage of the pair was unfair, due to them being Kennedys.&lt;ref name="Andersen, p. 316"&gt;Andersen, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; But Joe paraphrased John's father by stating, "Ask not what you can do for your cousin, but what you can do for his magazine."&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, pp. 322-323.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Magazine decline====
By early 1997, Kennedy and Berman found themselves locked in a power struggle, which led to screaming matches, slammed doors, and even one physical altercation. Eventually Berman sold his share of the company, and Kennedy took on Berman's responsibilities himself. Though the magazine had already begun to decline in popularity before Berman left, his departure was followed by a rapid drop in sales.&lt;ref name=Heymann438 /&gt;

[[David Pecker]], CEO of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines who were partners in ''George'', said that this was because Kennedy refused to "take risks as an editor, despite the fact that he was an extraordinary risk taker in other areas of his life." Pecker said, "He understood that the target audience for ''George'' was the eighteen-to-thirty-four-year-old demographic, yet he would routinely turn down interviews that would appeal to this age group, like [[Princess Diana]] or [[John Gotti Jr.]], to interview subjects like [[Dan Rostenkowski]] or [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]]."&lt;ref name=Heymann438&gt;Heymann, p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly before his death, Kennedy had been planning a series of online chats with the 2000 presidential candidates. [[Microsoft]] was to provide the technology and pay for it while receiving advertising in ''George''.&lt;ref name=Blow274&gt;Blow, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, the magazine was bought out by Hachette,&lt;ref name="media"&gt;Bercovici, Jeff (2001). [http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2001/jan01/jan02/5_fri/news1friday.html "Hachette delivers death ax to George"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180348/http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2001/jan01/jan02/5_fri/news1friday.html |date=2007-09-30 }}. ''[[Media Life Magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; but folded in early 2001.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0101/06/rs.00.html "Reliable Sources: 'George' Folds"]. CNN.

== Later life ==

===Family activity===
[[File:C30001-29.jpg|thumb|right|A June 24, 1985 reception for the [[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|John F. Kennedy Library Foundation]] held at Senator Ted Kennedy's McLean, Virginia residence. Pictured are Ted Kennedy, President [[Ronald Reagan]], First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]], Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, [[Ethel Kennedy]], Caroline Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr]]

Kennedy addressed the 1988 Democratic National Convention, introducing his uncle, Senator Ted Kennedy. He invoked his father's inaugural address, calling "a generation to public service", and received a two-minute standing ovation.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/19/us/john-f-kennedy-jr-heir-to-a-formidable-dynasty.html?module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3As|title=John F. Kennedy Jr., Heir To a Formidable Dynasty|date=July 19, 1999|work=New York Times|first=Katherine Q.|last=Selye}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican consultant Richard Viguerie said he did not remember a word of the speech, but remembered "a good delivery" and added, "I think it was a plus for the Democrats and the boy. He is strikingly handsome."&lt;ref name=Wadler1988&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20099904,00.html|title=The Sexiest Kennedy|first=Joyce|last=Wadler|date=September 12, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy participated in his cousin [[Patrick J. Kennedy]]'s campaign for a seat in the Rhode Island House of Representatives by visiting the district.&lt;ref&gt;Bly, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; He sat outside the polling booth and had his picture taken with "would-be" voters. The polaroid ploy worked so well in the campaign that Patrick J. Kennedy used it again in 1994.

===Relationships===
While attending [[Brown University]], Kennedy met Sally Munro, whom he dated for six years, and they visited India in 1983. While he was a student at Brown, he also met [[Brooke Shields]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/actress-model-brooke-shields-reveals-didn-lose-virginity-22-article-1.378038|title=Actress and former model Brooke Shields reveals that she didn't lose her virginity until she was 22|date=May 25, 2009|first=Liisa|last=O'Neill|publisher=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he was later linked.

Kennedy also dated models [[Cindy Crawford]] and Julie Baker, as well as actress [[Sarah Jessica Parker]],&lt;ref name=Landau9495&gt;Landau, pp. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; who said she enjoyed dating Kennedy but realized he "was a public domain kind of a guy." Parker claimed to have no idea what "real fame" was until dating Kennedy and felt that she should "apologize for dating him" since it became the "defining factor in the person" she was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/20/movies/film-bimbo-sarah-jessica-parker-begs-to-differ.html|title=FILM; Bimbo? Sarah Jessica Parker Begs to Differ|work=New York Times|date=September 20, 1992|first=Michael|last=Specter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy had known actress [[Daryl Hannah]] since their two families had vacationed together in St. Maarten in the early '80s. After meeting again at the wedding of his aunt [[Lee Radziwill]] in 1988, they dated for five and a half years, though their relationship was complicated by her feelings for singer [[Jackson Browne]], with whom she had lived for a time.

Also during this time, Kennedy dated Christina Haag. They had known each other as children, and she also attended Brown University.

===Marriage===
After his relationship with Daryl Hannah ended, Kennedy [[Cohabitation|cohabitated]] with [[Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy|Carolyn Bessette]], who worked in the fashion industry and was the youngest daughter of William J. Bessette and Ann Messina Freeman. They were engaged for a year, though Kennedy consistently denied reports of this. On September 21, 1996, they married in a private ceremony on [[Cumberland Island]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Landau|first=Elaine|title=John F. Kennedy, Jr.|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|year=2000|pages=117|isbn=0-7613-1857-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his sister, Caroline, was [[matron of honor]] and his cousin Anthony Radziwill was best man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heymann|first=Clemens David |title=American Legacy: The Story of John &amp; Caroline Kennedy|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2007|pages=458|isbn=0-7434-9738-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, Kennedy's cousin Patrick revealed that the pair had married. When they returned to their Manhattan home, a mass of reporters was on the doorstep. One of them asked Kennedy if he had enjoyed his honeymoon, to which he responded: "Very much." He added "Getting married is a big adjustment for us, and for a private citizen like Carolyn even more so. I ask you to give her all the privacy and room you can."&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, p. 463.&lt;/ref&gt;

But Carolyn was, in fact, badly disoriented by the constant attention from the paparazzi. The couple was permanently on show, both at fashionable Manhattan events, and on their travels to visit celebrities such as Mariuccia Mandelli and [[Gianni Versace]].&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; She also complained to her friend, journalist Jonathan Soroff, that she could not get a job without being accused of exploiting her fame.&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, pp. 472-473.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flying history==
Kennedy took flying lessons at the Flight Safety Academy in [[Vero Beach, Florida]].&lt;ref name="Andersen, p. 316"/&gt; In April 1998, he received his pilot's license, which he had dreamed about since he was a child.&lt;ref name=Landau117&gt;Landau, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of his cousin [[Michael LeMoyne Kennedy|Michael]] in a skiing accident brought about a change in Kennedy, making death "just seem closer and closer."&lt;ref&gt;Blow, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy felt so distressed that he took a hiatus from his piloting lessons at Flight Safety International in Florida for three months. His sister Caroline had hoped that his decision to stop taking piloting lessons would be permanent, but when he resumed, she resigned herself to the "fact that she could do little to stop him."&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, p. 478-479.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

{{Main|John F. Kennedy Jr. plane crash}}

On July 16, 1999, Kennedy departed from [[Fairfield Township, Essex County, New Jersey|Fairfield]], New Jersey at the controls of his [[Piper Saratoga]] light aircraft. He was traveling with his wife [[Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy|Carolyn]] and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette to attend the wedding of his cousin [[Rory Kennedy]] at [[Martha's Vineyard]], [[Massachusetts]]. He had purchased the plane on April 28, 1999, from Air Bound Aviation.&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Carolyn and Lauren were passengers sitting in the second row of seats.&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy had checked in with the [[control tower]] at the Martha's Vineyard Airport, but the plane was reported missing after it failed to arrive on schedule.&lt;ref name=Heymann499&gt;Heymann, p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials were not optimistic about finding survivors after aircraft debris and a black suitcase belonging to Bessette were recovered from the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt; President [[Bill Clinton]] gave his support to the [[Kennedy family]] during the search for the three missing passengers.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/jfkjr/stories/kennedy071899.htm|title=JFK Jr. Feared Dead in Plane Crash|date=July 18, 1999|work=Washington Post|first=Michael|last=Grunwald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, a Coast Guard admiral declared an end to hope that Kennedy, his wife and her sister could be found alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gellman|first=Barton|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/jfkjr/stories/kennedy071999.htm|work=Washington Post|title=No Hope of Survivors, Admiral Tells Families|date=July 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 19, the fragments of Kennedy's plane were found by the NOAA vessel Rude using side-scan sonar. The next day, Navy divers descended into the {{convert|62|F|adj=on}} water. The divers found part of the shattered plane strewn over a broad area of seabed 120 feet (37 m) below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The search ended in the late afternoon of July 21, when the three bodies were recovered from the ocean floor by Navy divers and taken by motorcade to the county medical examiner's office.&lt;ref name="washpo timeline"/&gt; The discovery was made from high-resolution images of the ocean bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-07-22/news/9907220415_1_carolyn-bessette-kennedy-bessette-family-rep-patrick-kennedy|title=Divers Found Bodies|date=July 22, 1999|work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divers found Carolyn and Lauren's bodies near the twisted and broken fuselage while Kennedy's body was still strapped into the pilot's seat.&lt;ref name=Heymann499/&gt; Admiral Richard M. Larrabee of the Coast Guard said that all three bodies were "near and under" the fuselage, still strapped in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/22/us/bodies-from-kennedy-crash-are-found.html|last=Allen|first=Mike|date=July 22, 1999|work=New York Times|title=Bodies From Kennedy Crash Are Found}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that pilot error was the probable cause of the crash: "Kennedy's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was a result of [[spatial disorientation]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/about/employment/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20001212X19354&amp;ntsbno=NYC99MA178&amp;akey=1|title=NTSB report NYC99MA178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of July 21, the bodies were autopsied at the county medical examiner's office; the findings revealed that the crash victims had died upon impact. At the same time, the Kennedy and Bessette families announced their plans for memorial services.&lt;ref name="washpo timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/jfkjr/recovery.htm|title=Crash and Search Time Line|date=July 22, 1999|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 21, the three bodies were taken from [[Hyannis, Massachusetts|Hyannis]] to [[Duxbury, Massachusetts]], where they were cremated in the Mayflower Cemetery crematorium.&lt;ref name="DuxburyClipper"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://theduxburyfile.wikispaces.com/file/view/John+F+Kennedy+Jr+Cremated+in+Duxbury,+July+1999.pdf|title=Kennedy cremated in Duxbury|last=Maxwell|first=Paula|date=July 28, 1999|work=Duxbury Clipper|accessdate=29 November 2012|location=Duxbury. MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ted Kennedy favored a public service for John while Caroline Kennedy insisted on family privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of July 22, their ashes were scattered at sea from the Navy [[destroyer]] {{USS|Briscoe|DD-977|6}} off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gellman |first=Barton|title=Kennedy, Bessettes Given Shipboard Rites |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/jfkjr/stories/kennedy072399.htm  |author2=Ferdinand, Pamela |date=1999-07-23|work=Washington Post|pages=A1| accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial service was held for Kennedy on July 23, 1999, at the [[St. Thomas More Church (New York City)|Church of St. Thomas More]], which was a parish that Kennedy had often attended with his mother and sister. The invitation-only service was attended by hundreds of mourners, including President Bill Clinton, who presented the family with photo albums of John and Carolyn on their visit to the White House from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy's last will and testament stipulated that his personal belongings, property, and holdings were to be "evenly distributed" among his sister Caroline Kennedy's three children, who were among fourteen beneficiaries in his will.&lt;ref name=Heymann499/&gt;

==Legacy==
John F. Kennedy Jr. was the first child ever born to a [[President-elect of the United States]]. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the assassination of John Jr.'s father on November 22, 1963, the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' re-ran the famous photograph of the three-year-old John Jr. saluting his father's coffin during the funeral procession. Photographer Dan Farrell, who took the photo, called it "the saddest thing I've ever seen in my whole life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/daily-news-photo-jfk-jr-s-salute-dad-haunts-article-1.1520240|title=Daily News' iconic photo of JFK Jr.'s salute to dad's coffin still haunts|date=November 17, 2013|publisher=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Reaching Up, the organization which Kennedy founded in 1989, joined with The City University of New York to establish the John F. Kennedy Jr. Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/hhs/jfkjrinstitute.html|title=JFK, JR. INSTITUTE FOR WORKER EDUCATION}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 19, 2003, the ARCO Forum at Harvard University's [[Kennedy School of Government]] was renamed to the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum of Public Affairs. An active participant in Forum events, Kennedy had also been a member of the IOP's Senior Advisory Committee for fifteen years. Kennedy's paternal uncle, Ted, said the renaming would symbolically link Kennedy and his father while his sister, Caroline, stated the renaming represented his love of discussing politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/9/22/arco-forum-at-iop-renamed-in/|title=ARCO Forum at IOP Renamed In Honor of John F.

== Personal history ==

===Early years===

Gottfried was born in 1966 in [[Brooklyn, New York]].  At or around his first birthday, Gottfried's family moved from an apartment in the [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn]] section of [[New York City]] to [[Howard Beach, Queens]] where they moved into a then newly built two-level ranch house in the [[Rockwood Park, Queens]] section of [[Howard Beach, Queens]].

Gottfried is the son of Rosalie Gottfried and the late Bertram Gottfried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bertram Gottfried |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/palmbeachpost/obituary.aspx?n=bertram-gottfried&amp;pid=152830540&amp;fhid=5124 |title=Bertram Gottfried Obituary: View Bertram Gottfried's Obituary by The Palm Beach Post |publisher=Legacy.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gottfried's mother is the daughter of immigrants from [[Çanakkale]], Turkey and a long-time resident of [[Howard Beach, Queens]]. She worked as a middle-school math teacher for the New York City Board of Education for over 40 years until her retirement in 2004; her last teaching assignment prior to her retirement was the [[Albert Shanker School Of Visual And Performing Arts]] in [[Queens, New York]].

On October 7, 2005, Gottfried's nomination was unanimously confirmed by the [[U.S. Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queenstribune.com/news/1131648874.html |accessdate=February 19, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922191802/http://www.queenstribune.com/news/1131648874.html |archivedate=September 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 2005, at a ceremony held at HUD's headquarters in Washington, D.C., the [[Robert C.

===Service as General Counsel===

As General Counsel of the HUD, Gottfried led a nationwide organization of approximately 700 employees, including close to 400 attorneys and 300 non-attorneys with headquarters in Washington, D.C., ten regional counsel offices and close to forty field counsel offices around the country.  At the time, the Office of General Counsel of HUD had an annual budget of approximately $100 million.

Gottfried served as this cabinet agency's Chief Legal Officer and was the Senior Legal Advisor to the Secretary, Deputy Secretary and other agency principal staff in the department providing advice on all aspects of Federal laws, regulations and policies applicable to public and Indian housing, community development programs, mortgage insurance programs, complex mixed financing transactions for residential development and health care facilities, fair housing enforcement and urban development programs as well as federal laws, regulations and policies governing ethics, procurement, personnel management and labor relations.

As General Counsel of HUD, Gottfried was a member of the Federal Housing Administration's Mortgagee Review Board. He also served as the Chief Legal Officer for the [[Government National Mortgage Association]] (Ginnie Mae).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novoco.com/low_income_housing/news/2006archive.php "Gottfried to Keynote Housing Conference"], August 2006, accessed 7 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure as General Counsel of HUD, Gottfried was perhaps best known{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} for his push for enhanced regulatory transparency at HUD as he pushed for HUD to adopt no-action and interpretative letter processes similar to those he had been familiar with as a securities lawyer practicing before the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]].

During Gottfried's tenure as General Counsel, HUD announced the then largest settlement of an enforcement action in the history of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.hud.gov/news/2006/pr06-002.cfm |title=HUD Archives: HUD ANNOUNCES LANDMARK $41 MILLION SETTLEMENT AGAINST ABN AMRO |publisher=Archives.hud.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
;''Winning in Emerging Markets''
In ''[[Winning in Emerging Markets (book by Tarun Khanna and Krishna Palepu)|Winning in Emerging Markets]]'', released in 2010, [[Tarun Khanna]] and Krishna Palepu outline a practical framework for developing emerging market strategies based not on broad categorical definitions like geography, but on a structural understanding of these markets. Their framework describes how “institutional voids” – the absence of intermediaries like market research firms and credit card systems to efficiently connect buyers and sellers – create daunting obstacles for companies trying to operate in emerging markets. Understanding these voids – and learning how to work with them in specific markets – is the key to success.&lt;ref name="winninin"/&gt;

The fourth edition of ''[[Business Analysis And Valuation Using Financial Statements: Text and Cases]]'', co-authored with Paul Healy, was published by Thomson Southwestern in 2007.&lt;ref name="cenpage"/&gt; Based on Krishna Palepu's research on mergers and acquisitions, finance and corporate disclosure, this textbook is widely used in college and MBA courses on business analysis and valuation.

It is accompanied by a business analysis and valuation software model published by the [[Harvard Business School|Harvard Business School Publishing Company]].&lt;ref name="hbr"/&gt; A fifth edition was published in 2013.&lt;ref name="fifth"/&gt;

==History==
Saylor started MicroStrategy in 1989 with a consulting contract from [[DuPont]], which provided Saylor with $250,000 in start-up capital and office space in Wilmington, Delaware. Saylor was soon joined by company co-founder [[Sanju Bansal]], whom he had met while the two were students at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=Glasser96&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/washtech/daily/june96/061596saylor.htm | title=From the Ground Up and Up | first=Jeff | last=Glasser |work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=July 15, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company produced software for [[data mining]] and business intelligence using [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear mathematics]],&lt;ref name=Jaffe00 /&gt; an idea inspired by a course on systems-dynamics theory that they took at MIT.&lt;ref name=Salter00&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.fastcompany.com/39401/people-and-technology-microstrategy-inc | title=People and Technology - MicroStrategy Inc. | first=Chuck | last=Salter | work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] | date= March 31, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1992, MicroStrategy gained its first major client when it signed a $10 million contract with [[McDonald's]]. It increased revenues by 100% each year between 1990 and 1996.&lt;ref name=Glasser96/&gt; In 1994, the company's offices and its 50 employees moved from Delaware to [[Tysons Corner, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=Leibovich02&gt;{{cite news | title=MicroStrategy's CEO Sped to the Brink | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2002/01/06/microstrategys-ceo-sped-to-the-brink/7a0ab40f-1d6e-42f3-8f28-b907de3c8d67/ | first=Mark | last=Leibovich | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=January 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Morgan-Bedinger-Dandridge House''' — first known as '''Poplar Grove''', then '''Rosebrake''' — is part of a group of structures affiliated with the [[Morgan's Grove]] rural historic district near [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia]].  The property was known as "Poplar Grove" until 1877.

==History==
The original building on the site was built around 1745 by settler Richard Morgan (''ca.'' 1700-1763) and became known as the "Back Building". In 1803 the house was expanded by Daniel Morgan with a two-story brick structure, known as the "Great House".  Formal gardens were added at this time.

In 1859 the present main portion of the house was built by Caroline Bedinger, widow of [[Henry Bedinger]]. During her ownership the house was occupied by Colonel [[Alexander R. Boteler]], a former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] who, at the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] became a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officer.  After the war, while Boteler was living at Poplar Grove, President [[Ulysses S. Grant|U.S. Grant]] appointed Boteler to the U. S. Centennial Commission.  Caroline's daughter, [[Danske Dandridge|Danske Bedinger Dandridge]], a noted poet, changed the name of the house to "Rosebrake" in 1877.

A [[portico]] was added to the house in 1950, removed from a house on [[Long Island]] and shipped to West Virginia.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Nomination: Morgan-Bedinger-Dandridge House|url=http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/jefferson/83003239.pdf |format=pdf|date=March 28, 1983 |author=Michael J.

An '''occupational disease''' is any chronic ailment that occurs as a result of work or occupational activity. It is an aspect of [[occupational safety and health]]. An occupational disease is typically identified when it is shown that it is more prevalent in a given body of workers than in the general population, or in other worker populations. The [[Chimney sweeps' carcinoma|first such disease to be recognised]], [[squamous-cell carcinoma]] of the [[scrotum]], was identified in [[chimney sweep]] boys by [[Percivall Pott|Sir Percival Pott]] in 1775{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}.  Occupational hazards that are of a traumatic nature (such as falls by roofers) are not considered to be occupational diseases.

Under the law of [[workers' compensation]] in many jurisdictions, there is a presumption that specific disease are caused by the worker being in the work environment and the burden is on the employer or insurer to show that the disease came about from another cause. Diseases compensated by national workers compensation authorities are often termed occupational diseases. However, many countries do not offer compensations for certain diseases like musculoskeletal disorders caused by work (e.g. in Norway). Therefore, the term work-related diseases is  utilized to describe diseases of occupational origin. This term however would then include both compensable and non-compensable diseases that have occupational origins.

==Examples==
Some well-known occupational diseases include:

===Lung diseases===
{{Main article|Occupational lung disease}}
Occupational lung diseases include [[asbestosis]] among [[asbestos]] miners and those who work with friable asbestos insulation, as well as black lung ([[coalworker's pneumoconiosis]]) among [[coal miner]]s, [[silicosis]] among miners and quarrying and tunnel operators and [[byssinosis]] among workers in parts of the cotton textile industry.

[[Occupational asthma]] has a vast number of [[Occupational asthma#Occupations at risk|occupations at risk]].

Bad [[indoor air quality]] may predispose for diseases in the lungs as well as in other parts of the body.

===Skin diseases===
{{Main article|Occupational skin diseases}}
Occupational skin diseases are ranked among the top five occupational diseases in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kanerva's Occupational Dermatology|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-3-642-02035-3|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupational skin diseases and conditions are generally caused by chemicals and having wet hands for long periods while at work. [[Eczema]] is by far the most common, but [[urticaria]], [[sunburn]] and [[skin cancer]] are also of concern.&lt;ref name=hse&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/skin/ HSE (Health and Safety Executive of Great Britain) Skin at work] Retrieved on June 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Contact dermatitis]] due to irritation is [[inflammation]] of the skin which results from a contact with an irritant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Irritant Dematitis|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-3-540-31294-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed that this type of [[dermatitis]] does not require prior sensitization of the [[immune system]]. There have been studies to support that past or present [[Atopic dermatitis|atopic]] [[Atopic dermatitis|dermatitis]] is a risk factor for this type of [[dermatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coenraads|first=P. J.|last2=Diepgen|first2=T. L.|date=1998-02-01|title=Risk for hand eczema in employees with past or present atopic dermatitis|journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health|volume=71|issue=1|pages=7–13|issn=0340-0131|pmid=9523243|doi=10.1007/s004200050243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common irritants include detergents, acids, alkalies, oils, organic solvents and reducing agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elsner|first=P.|date=1994-07-01|title=Irritant dermatitis in the workplace|journal=Dermatologic Clinics|volume=12|issue=3|pages=461–467|issn=0733-8635|pmid=7923942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acute form of this dermatitis develops on exposure of the skin to a strong irritant or caustic chemical. This exposure can occur as a result of [[accident]] at a [[workplace]]. The irritant reaction starts to increase in its intensity within minutes to hours of exposure to the irritant and reaches its peak quickly. After the reaction has reached its peak level, it starts to heal. This process is known as decrescendo phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dermatotoxicology|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-0849397738|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most frequent potent irritants leading to this type of dermatitis are acids and alkaline solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eichmann|first=A.|last2=Amgwerd|first2=D.|date=1992-05-05|title=[Toxic contact dermatitis]|journal=Schweizerische Rundschau Für Medizin Praxis = Revue Suisse De Médecine Praxis|volume=81|issue=19|pages=615–617|issn=1013-2058|pmid=1589676}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms include redness and swelling of the skin along with the formation of blisters.

The chronic form occurs as a result of repeated exposure of the skin to weak irritants over long periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=M. V.|date=1988-01-01|title=Chronic, irritant contact dermatitis: mechanisms, variables, and differentiation from other forms of contact dermatitis|journal=Advances in Dermatology|volume=3|pages=261–275|issn=0882-0880|pmid=3152823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical manifestations of the contact dermatitis are also modified by external factors such as environmental factors (mechanical pressure, temperature, and humidity) and predisposing characteristics of the individual (age, sex, ethnic origin, preexisting skin disease, atopic skin diathesis, and anatomic region exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/diseases/dermatitis.html|title=Dermatitis, Irritant Contact : OSH Answers|last=Safety|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and|website=www.ccohs.ca|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another occupational skin disease is Glove related hand urticaria. It has been reported as an occupational problem among the health care workers. This type of hand urticaria is believed to be caused by repeated wearing and removal of the gloves. The reaction is caused by the latex or the nitrile present in the gloves.&lt;ref&gt;Glove-related hand urticaria: an increasing occupational problem amongst health care workers. Hawkey S, Abdul Ghaffar S.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
[[Donald Hunter (physician)|Donald Hunter]] in his classic history of occupational diseases discusses many example of occupational diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald |last=Hunter |title=Diseases of Occupations |location= |publisher=Hodder Arnold |edition=8th rev. |year=1994 |isbn=0-340-55173-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They include:
* [[Phossy jaw]] among the [[London matchgirls strike of 1888|London matchgirls]]
* [[Radiation sickness]] among some persons who had been working in the nuclear industry
* [[Radium jaw]] among the [[Radium Girls]]
* [[Squamous cell carcinoma]] of the skin of the scrotum among chimney sweeps (see [[Chimney sweeps' carcinoma]])

==Prevention==
Prevention measures include avoidance of the irritant through its removal from the workplace or through technical shielding by the use of potent irritants in closed systems or automation, irritant replacement or removal &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Occupational Dermatology|isbn=978-3-662-07679-8 |last= |first= |publisher= |year= |location= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and personal protection of the workers.

In order to better prevent and control occupational [[disease]], most countries revise and update their related laws, most of them greatly increasing the penalties in case of breaches of the occupational disease laws. Occupational disease prevention, in general legally regulated, is part of good [[supply chain]] management and enables companies to design and ensure supply chain social compliance schemes as well as monitor their implementation to identify and prevent occupational disease hazards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2007">In United States securities law, the '''quiet period''' (or '''waiting period''') has "historically [meant], a quiet period of time extended from the time a [[company]] files a [[SEC filing|registration statement]] with the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] until SEC staff declared the registration statement effective. During that period, the [[United States securities law|federal securities laws]] limited what information a company and related parties can release to the public."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/answers/quiet.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the rules of the [[Securities Act of 1933]], as modified June 29, 2005, electronic communications, including electronic road shows and information located on or [[hyperlink]]ed to an issuer's [[website]] are also governed. The rules changes of June 29, 2005, also included various changes which "liberalize permitted offering activity and communications to allow more information" for certain qualifying organizations.

In [[business finance]], a waiting period (or quiet period) is the time in which a company making an [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] must be silent about it, so as not to [[watered stock|inflate the value of the stock artificially]]. It is also called the '''cooling-off period'''.

==Guidelines==
During a Quiet Period, a publicly listed company cannot make any announcements about anything that could cause a normal investor to change their position on the company's stock. Normally, that means the company does not discuss any of the following:
* New deals or wins signed in that current quarter. Announcements about previously sold implementations going live are allowed but must be explicitly described as such.
* Management changes
* Progress against company goals
* Major product or service announcements
* Major partnership announcements

'''Federico Ramón Puerta''' (born September 9, 1951) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Peronism|Peronist]] politician who has served as a governor, senator and national deputy and effectively acted as [[President of Argentina]] during 2001.

==Biography==

Puerta was born in [[Apóstoles]], [[Misiones Province]]. He attended the [[Universidad Católica Argentina]] in [[Buenos Aires]] and qualified as a civil engineer. However, he entered the family business of the cultivation of [[yerba maté]], and became a successful businessman and millionaire.

Puerta was elected a [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|national deputy]] for Misiones in 1987. In 1991 he was elected Governor of Misiones Province, re-elected in 1995 and served until 1999. He followed the [[neo-liberal]] economic model of President [[Carlos Menem]], including privatising the provincial bank of which his own grandfather had been a founder.

In 1999 he was re-elected to the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] and in 2001 he was elected to the [[Argentine Senate|Senate]]. In November of that year, he was elected provisory President of the [[Argentine Senate]], constitutionally third in line to the nation's presidency.

Puerta served as the acting head of the executive branch of the country for two days on December 21 and December 22, 2001. He came to that position in his capacity as [[President Pro Tempore]] of the Senate and, as there was no Vice President, he was next in line to the nation's highest office when President [[Fernando de la Rúa]] resigned amid [[December 2001 riots (Argentina)|rioting]]. A week after giving up the presidency, Puerta resigned as leader of the Senate in order to avoid retaking the presidency, following a second institutional crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1735300.stm|title= Argentina 'to cancel' elections|author= |date= December 31, 2001|publisher= BBC|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puerta stood to be Governor of Misiones in 2003, but lost to his successor, [[Carlos Rovira]]. He retired from the Senate in 2005. He ran for governor of Misiones again in 2007, and was defeated in the October election, coming in third place with 15% of the vote.

==Personal life==
Puerta is unmarried and has two children.

==Personal life==
Avery was born in [[Kent]], England.&lt;ref name=lessons&gt;{{cite news |title=Lessons from mean streets of London |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10890968 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=17 June 2013 |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending his childhood in orphanages and foster homes, he developed an interest in science at the age of 14 while living [[Homelessness|rough]] in London and finding warmth in public libraries.&lt;ref name=nzawards&gt;[http://www.nzawards.org.nz/AwardRecipients/NewZealanderbroftheYear/tabid/36008/Default.aspx New Zealander of the Year Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223212319/http://www.nzawards.org.nz/AwardRecipients/NewZealanderbroftheYear/tabid/36008/Default.aspx |date=23 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He now mentors young people, speaking regularly at schools and universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnz.co.nz/good-morning/inspiring-kiwis-ray-avery-3379511 Inspiring Kiwis: Ray Avery]. [[Television New Zealand]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was later educated at [[Wye College]], a tertiary agricultural college in Kent.&lt;ref name=determination/&gt;

He settled in New Zealand in 1973 and became a New Zealand citizen within nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Great end to glorious Christmas |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10697215 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=31 December 2010 |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Avery published his autobiography ''Rebel with a Cause'', which charts his life from childhood in English orphanages and foster homes to knighthood.&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt;&lt;ref name=determination&gt;"[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU1007/S00410/one-kiwis-determination-to-make-a-difference.htm One Kiwi's determination to make a difference]".

==Career==
After graduating, Avery worked as an analyst in laboratories, in which he eventually took a shareholding.&lt;ref name=determination/&gt; After leaving Britain and settling in New Zealand, he was a founding member of the Department of Clinical Pharmacology at the [[University of Auckland School of Medicine]]. He was then the technical director of [[Douglas Pharmaceuticals]], where he developed and commercialised pharmaceutical and nutritional products.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite news |title=NZ man aids millions with 15c water drip invention |first=Simon |last=Collins |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/poverty/news/article.cfm?c_id=286&amp;objectid=8501056 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=1 December 2004 |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Technical Director of the [[Fred Hollows Foundation]], Avery designed and commissioned two state of the art [[intraocular lens]] manufacturing facilities in [[Asmara, Eritrea]] and [[Kathmandu, Nepal]], and developed novel low cost lens manufacturing technologies, systems, and global distribution networks. The Fred Hollows Foundation laboratories now provide 13% of the world market for intraocular lenses and use technology invented and gifted by Avery.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.committeeforauckland.co.nz/component/content/article/8-news-and-publications/200-no-respect-for-the-status-quo No respect for the status quo]". Committee for Auckland.&lt;/ref&gt; The mass introduction of regulatory-approved low-cost high-quality Fred Hollows lenses collapsed the global price of lenses, making modern [[cataract surgery]] accessible to the world's poorest.

In 2003, Avery founded the international development organisation [[Medicine Mondiale]] dedicated to making quality healthcare and equipment accessible to even the poorest developing nations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.medicinemondiale.org/about-us.html About Medicine Mondiale]".

==Medicine Mondiale==

'''Medicine Mondiale''' is an independent development agency headed by Ray Avery focused on improving life for the world's poor by developing products and technologies that have applications in both the developing and developed world markets.

== Projects ==

=== Intraocular lenses ===

Between 1993 and 1997 Ray Avery designed and commissioned two state-of-the-art [[intraocular lens]] laboratories in [[Eritrea]] and in [[Nepal]]. Together these labs now supply 10% of the world market for intraocular lenses and together with the efforts of other generic lens manufacturers have collapsed the price of lenses from over US$300 in 1992 to around US$6 today.  As a result, [[cataract]] surgery is now available to the very poorest around the world.

=== Acuset IV flow controller ===

The Acuset is a small device designed to control the flow of drugs through an [[intravenous therapy|intravenous (IV) drip]]. Unlike roller-clamp device still commonly used in the developing world, the Acuset is intuitive to use, even by untrained operators.  It allows fine control and precision of flow rates, eliminating the accidental harm, and in some cases death, caused by incorrect drug doses.&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt; In 2008 the Acuset was a finalist in the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi World Changing Ideas Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://saatchi.com/en-us/news/world_changing_ideas_award_finalists_announced/ |title=World Changing Ideas award finalists announced |date=22 January 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infant nutrition ===

Medicine Mondiale has developed a range of nutritional productions for the treatment of protein-energy [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref name=Maternova&gt;{{cite web |url= http://maternova.org/health-innovations/proteinforte-predigested-protein-formulations |title=Proteinforte predigested protein formulations |date=6 August 2014 |publisher=Maternova |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are designed to combat acute [[diarrhoea]], which is the leading cause of death in infants under two years of age in the developing world.&lt;ref name="Infant nutrition"/&gt;

=== Infant incubator ===

The Lifepod infant incubator is a low cost but high end [[Incubator (neonatal)|incubator]] invented by Sir Ray Avery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hgfoundation.co.nz/Who+We+Support/Medical+Research++Innovation/Medicine+Mondiale.html |title=Medicine Mondiale |publisher=Hugh Green Foundation |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incubator is designed around performance, ease of use and simple maintenance in challenging conditions, such as in poorly resourced healthcare facilities with inconsistent power and water supplies.

Much of the incubator's features have been designed in response to shortcomings in many current incubator designs, which are not always effective or practical in challenging conditions.

By combining an innovative microbial filtration system, as well as robust electronics and mechanisms, Medicine Mondiale intend for the Liferaft infant incubator to be a 'plug and play' solution for neonatal healthcare facilities, requiring little or no maintenance.&lt;ref name="Infant incubator"/&gt;

==Books==
Avery has published two books: the best-selling Autobiography “Rebel with a Cause” &lt;ref&gt;"[http://penguin.co.nz/books/rebel-with-a-cause-9781869793913 Rebel with a Cause]" Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt; charting his life from street kid to Knighthood and “The Power of Us” &lt;ref&gt;"[http://beattiesbookblog.blogspot.co.nz/2012/11/the-power-of-us.html The Power of Us] Beattie's Book Blog&lt;/ref&gt; celebrating New Zealanders who dare to dream.

The Rothschild family has frequently been the subject of [[conspiracy theories]], many of which have [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] origins.&lt;ref name=conspiracy1/&gt;

==Overview==
The first member of the family who was known to use the name "Rothschild" was Izaak Elchanan Rothschild, born in 1577. The name is derived from the [[German language|German]] ''zum rothen Schild'' (with the old spelling "th"), meaning "at the red shield", in reference to the house where the family lived for many generations (in those days houses were designated not by numbers but by signs displaying different symbols or colours). A red shield can still be seen at the centre of the Rothschild coat of arms. The family's ascent to international prominence began in 1744, with the birth of [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]], Germany. He was the son of [[Amschel Moses Rothschild]] (born circa 1710),&lt;ref&gt;{{NDB|22|131|133|Rothschild, Mayer Amschel|Pohl, Manfred}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[money changer]] who had traded with the [[House of Hesse|Prince of Hesse]]. Born in the "[[Frankfurter Judengasse|Judengasse]]", the [[ghetto]] of [[Frankfurt]], Mayer developed a finance house and spread his empire by installing each of his five sons in the five main European financial centres to conduct [[business]]. The Rothschild coat of arms contains a clenched fist with five arrows symbolising the five dynasties established by the five sons of Mayer Rothschild, in a reference to [[Psalms|Psalm]] 127: "Like arrows in the hands of a warrior, so are the children of one's youth." The family motto appears below the shield: ''Concordia, Integritas, Industria'' (Unity, Integrity, Industry).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] writes "[T]he Rothschilds are elusive. There is no book about them that is both revealing and accurate. Libraries of nonsense have been written about them... A woman who planned to write a book entitled ''Lies about the Rothschilds'' abandoned it, saying: 'It was relatively easy to spot the lies, but it proved impossible to find out the truth.'" He writes that, unlike the [[court Jew|court factor]]s of earlier centuries, who had financed and managed European noble houses, but often lost their wealth through violence or expropriation, the new kind of international bank created by the Rothschilds was impervious to local attacks. Their assets were held in financial instruments, circulating through the world as stocks, bonds and debts. Changes made by the Rothschilds allowed them to insulate their property from local violence: "Henceforth their real wealth was beyond the reach of the mob, almost beyond the reach of greedy monarchs."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson, ''A History of the Jews'', p.317.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson argued that their fortune was generated to the greatest extent by [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] in London; however, more recent research by [[Niall Ferguson]] indicates that greater and equal profits also were realised by the other Rothschild dynasties, including [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] in Paris, [[Carl Mayer von Rothschild]] in Naples and [[Amschel Mayer Rothschild]] in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;''The House of Rothschild (Vol. 2): The World's Banker: 1849–1999'', Niall Ferguson (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another essential part of Mayer Rothschild's strategy for success was to keep control of their banks in family hands, allowing them to maintain full secrecy about the size of their fortunes. In about 1906, the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] noted: "The practice initiated by the Rothschilds of having several brothers of a firm establish branches in the different financial centres was followed by other Jewish financiers, like the [[Bischoffsheim family|Bischoffsheims]], [[Péreire brothers|Pereires]], [[Joseph Seligman|Seligmans]], [[Lazard]]s and others, and these financiers by their integrity and financial skill obtained credit not alone with their Jewish confrères, but with the banking fraternity in general. By this means, Jewish financiers obtained an increasing share of international finance during the middle and last quarter of the 19th century. The head of the whole group was the Rothschild family..." It also states: "Of more recent years, non-Jewish financiers have learned the same cosmopolitan method, and, on the whole, the control is now rather less than more in Jewish hands than formerly."&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'' c. 1906 [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=142&amp;letter=F&amp;search=Finance Finance]&lt;/ref&gt;
Mayer Rothschild successfully kept the fortune in the family with carefully [[arranged marriage]]s, often between first- or second-[[cousin marriage|cousins]] (similar to [[royal intermarriage]]). By the late 19th century, however, almost all Rothschilds had started to marry outside the family, usually into the aristocracy or other financial dynasties.&lt;ref name="Go Ahead, Kiss Your Cousin"&gt;[http://discovermagazine.com/2003/aug/featkiss Go Ahead, Kiss Your Cousin] by Richard Conniff, From the August 2003 issue, published online 1 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
His sons were:
* [[Amschel Mayer Rothschild]] (1773–1855): [[Frankfurt]], died childless as his fortune passed to the sons of Salomon and Calmann
* [[Salomon Mayer von Rothschild|Salomon Mayer Rothschild]] (1774–1855): [[Vienna]]
* [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] (1777–1836): [[London]]
* [[Carl Mayer von Rothschild|Calmann Mayer Rothschild]] (1788–1855): [[Naples]]
* [[James Mayer de Rothschild|Jakob Mayer Rothschild]] (1792–1868): [[Paris]]

The German family name "Rothschild" is pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈʁoːtʃɪlt|}} in [[German language|German]], unlike {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɒ|θ|(|s|)|tʃ|aɪ|l|d}} in [[English language|English]]. The surname "Rothschild" is rare in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verwandt.de/karten/absolut/rothschild.html Verwandt.de: ''Rothschild'']&lt;/ref&gt; The German surname "Rothschild" is not related to the Protestant surname "Rothchilds" from the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The five sons of Mayer Amschel Rothschild were elevated to the [[Austrian nobility]] by Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I of Austria]], and they were all granted the Austrian hereditary title of ''[[Freiherr]]'' ([[baron]]) on 29 September 1822.&lt;ref name="Wurzbach1874" /&gt; The [[Rothschild banking family of England|British branch of the family]] was elevated by [[Queen Victoria]], who granted the hereditary title of [[baronet]] (1847)&lt;ref&gt;''The Genealogy of the Existing British Peerage and Baronetage'', By Edmund Lodge, Hurst and Blackett, 1859, page 808&lt;/ref&gt; and later the [[hereditary peer]]age title of [[Baron Rothschild]] (1885).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=25486 |date=3 July 1885 |page=3060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted by ''GreatGameIndia Magazine'' has revealed that the Rothschild family was one of the controller families of the [[East India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=26 June 2016|title=Controller Houses Of The East India Company: EIC Series Part IV|url=http://greatgameindia.com/controller-houses-east-india-company-eic-series-part-iv/|journal=GreatGameIndia Magazine|series=East India Company Series|issue=Apr-June 2016 Issue|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rothschilds already possessed a significant fortune before the start of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803–1815), and the family had gained preeminence in the [[Precious metal#Bullion|bullion]] trade by this time.&lt;ref name="GrayOxNatBio" /&gt; From London in 1813 to 1815, [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] was instrumental in almost single-handedly financing the British war effort, organising the shipment of bullion to the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington's]] armies across Europe, as well as arranging the payment of British financial subsidies to their continental allies. In 1815 alone, the Rothschilds provided £9.8 million (in 1815 currency, about £566 million, €717 million or US$869 million today, when using the retail price index, and £6.58 billion, €8,34 billion or US$10.1 billion when using average earnings) in subsidy loans to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain's]] continental allies.&lt;ref name="Money 2008 page 78"&gt;''The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World'', (London 2008), page 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rothschild-metternichgasse.jpg|thumb|One of the smaller city houses, Vienna. A collection of far larger Viennese palaces known as [[Palais Rothschild]] were torn down during the Second World War.]]
The brothers helped coordinate Rothschild activities across the continent, and the family developed a network of agents, shippers and couriers to transport gold across war-torn Europe. The family network was also to provide Nathan Rothschild time and again with political and financial information ahead of his peers, giving him an advantage in the markets and rendering the house of Rothschild still more invaluable to the British government.

In one instance, the family network enabled Nathan to receive in London the news of Wellington's victory at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] a full day ahead of the government's official messengers.&lt;ref name="GrayOxNatBio" /&gt; Rothschild's first concern on this occasion was not to the potential financial advantage on the market which the knowledge would have given him; he and his courier immediately took the news to the government.&lt;ref name="GrayOxNatBio"&gt;Victor Gray and Melanie Aspey, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24162 "Rothschild, Nathan Mayer (1777–1836)"], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edition, May 2006. Retrieved 21 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was then repeated in later popular accounts, such as that of [[Frederic Morton|Morton]].&lt;ref name="Random Variables 1984"&gt;Victor Rothschild – "The Shadow of a Great Man" in ''Random Variables'', Collins, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferguson, Niall 1998"&gt;*Ferguson, Niall. ''The World's Banker: The History of the House of Rothschild.'' Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1998, {{ISBN|0-297-81539-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for the Rothschild's most famously profitable move was made after the news of British victory had been made public. Nathan Rothschild calculated that the future reduction in government borrowing brought about by the peace would create a bounce in British government bonds after a two-year stabilisation, which would finalise the post-war restructuring of the domestic economy.&lt;ref name="Money 2008 page 78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Random Variables 1984" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferguson, Niall 1998" /&gt; In what has been described as one of the most audacious moves in financial history, Nathan immediately bought up the government bond market, for what at the time seemed an excessively high price, before waiting two years, then selling the bonds on the crest of a short bounce in the market in 1817 for a 40% profit. Given the sheer power of leverage the Rothschild family had at their disposal, this profit was an enormous sum.&lt;ref name="Money 2008 page 78" /&gt;

Nathan Mayer Rothschild started his business in [[Manchester]] in 1806 and gradually moved it to [[London]], where in 1809 he acquired the location at 2 New Court in St. Swithin's Lane, [[City of London]],&lt;ref name="GrayOxNatBio" /&gt; where it operates today; he established [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons]] in 1811. In 1818, he arranged a £5 million (equal to £{{Inflation|UK|5|1818|r=-1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) loan to the [[Prussia]]n government, and the issuing of [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] for government [[loan]]s formed a mainstay of his bank’s business. He gained a position of such power in the [[City of London]] that by 1825–26 he was able to supply enough coin to the [[Bank of England]] to enable it to avert a [[market liquidity]] crisis.

Rothschild family banking businesses pioneered international high finance during the industrialisation of Europe and were instrumental in supporting railway systems across the world and in complex government financing for projects such as the [[Suez Canal]]. During the 19th century, the family bought up a large proportion of the property in [[Mayfair]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://family.rothschildarchive.org/estates/46-1-seamore-place|title="1, Seamore Place, London, England".

The Rothschild family was directly involved in the [[Independence of Brazil|Independence]] of [[Brazil]] from [[Portugal]] in the early 19th century.

In 1825, Nathan Rothschild raised £2,000,000, and indeed was probably discreetly involved in the earlier tranche of this loan which raised £1,000,000 in 1824.&lt;ref name="Brazil" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Major 19th-century businesses founded with Rothschild family capital include:
* Alliance Assurance (1824) (now [[Royal &amp; Sun Alliance]]);
* [[Chemin de Fer du Nord]] (1845)
* [[Rio Tinto Group|The Rio Tinto mining company]] (1873) (from the 1880s onwards, the Rothschilds had full control of Rio Tinto)&lt;ref&gt;''The Rio Tinto Company: an economic history of a leading international mining concern'', Charles E. Harvey (1981), page 188&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Eramet]] (1880)
* [[Imerys]] (1880)
* [[De Beers]] (1888)

The family funded [[Cecil Rhodes]] in the creation of the African colony of [[Southern Rhodesia|Rhodesia]]. From the late 1880s onwards, the family took over control of the Rio Tinto mining company.

The Japanese government approached the London and Paris families for funding during the [[Russo-Japanese War]].

The name of Rothschild became synonymous with extravagance and great wealth; and, the family was renowned for its art collecting, for its palaces, as well as for its philanthropy. By the end of the century, the family owned, or had built, at the lowest estimates, over 41 palaces, of a scale and luxury perhaps unparalleled even by the richest royal families.&lt;ref name="Money 2008 page 78" /&gt; The British Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Lloyd George]] claimed, in 1909, that [[Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Nathan, Lord Rothschild]] was the most powerful man in Britain.&lt;ref name="Rothschild 1999, page 481-85" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Jews'', Paul Johnson (London 2004), page 319–20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, with no male heir, the Frankfurt House closed its doors after more than a century in business. It was not until 1989 that the family returned, when N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons, the British investment arm, plus Bank Rothschild AG, the Swiss branch, set up a representative banking office in Frankfurt.

[[Hezekiah Niles|Niles']] Weekly Register, Volume 49 had the following to say about the Rothschilds influence on international high finance in 1836;

{{quote

They stretch their hand, with equal ease, from Petersburgh to Vienna, from Vienna to Paris, from Paris to London, from London to Washington.

==Hereditary titles==
In 1816, four of the five sons of Mayer Amschel Rothschild were elevated to the [[Austrian nobility]] by Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I of Austria]].&lt;ref name="Wurzbach1874"&gt;{{cite book|author=Constantin von Wurzbach|title=Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bb1gAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA120|accessdate=26 February 2018|year=1874|publisher=Zamarski|location=Vienna|language=German|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining son, [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild|Nathan]], was elevated in 1818. All of them were granted the Austrian hereditary title of ''[[Freiherr]]'' ([[baron]]) on 29 September 1822.&lt;ref name="Wurzbach1874" /&gt; As such, some members of the family used the [[nobiliary particle]] ''de'' or ''[[von]]'' before their surname to acknowledge the grant of nobility. Traditionally, a baron who received his title from the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], or (after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806) from the Austrian and later Austro-Hungarian Emperor, was known as a ''Reichsfreiherr'' ("Baron of the Empire"), although the title is usually shortened to ''Freiherr''.

In 1847, [[Sir Anthony de Rothschild, 1st Baronet|Sir Anthony de Rothschild]] was made a hereditary [[baronet]] of the United Kingdom. In 1885, [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Nathan Mayer Rothschild II]] was granted the [[hereditary peer]]age title of [[Baron Rothschild]] in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. This title is currently held by the [[Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild|4th Baron Rothschild]].

== British branch ==
{{Main article|Rothschild banking family of England}}
The Rothschild banking family of the United Kingdom was founded in 1798 by [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] (1777–1836), who first settled in [[Manchester]] but then moved to [[London]]. Nathan Mayer von Rothschild, the third son of [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]] (1744–1812), first established a [[textile]] jobbing business in Manchester and from there went on to establish [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons]] bank in London.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

During the early part of the 19th century, the Rothschild family's London bank took a leading part in managing and financing the subsidies that the British government transferred to its allies during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Through the creation of a network of agents, couriers and shippers, the bank was able to provide funds to the armies of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] in [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], therefore funding the war. The providing of other innovative and complex financing for government projects formed a mainstay of the bank's business for the better part of the century. N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons' financial strength in the [[City of London]] became such that, by 1825–26, the bank was able to supply enough coin to the [[Bank of England]] to enable it to avert a [[market liquidity|liquidity]] crisis.

Nathan Mayer's eldest son, [[Lionel de Rothschild]] (1808–1879), succeeded him as head of the London branch. Under Lionel, the bank financed the British government's 1875 purchase of [[Egypt]]'s interest in the [[Suez Canal]]. The Rothschild bank also funded [[Cecil Rhodes]] in the development of the [[British South Africa Company]]. [[Leopold de Rothschild]] (1845–1917) administered Rhodes's estate after his death in 1902 and helped to set up the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] scheme at the [[University of Oxford]]. In 1873, [[de Rothschild Frères]] in France and N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons of London joined with other investors to acquire the Spanish government's money-losing [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] copper mines. The new owners restructured the company and turned it into a profitable business. By 1905, the Rothschild interest in Rio Tinto amounted to more than 30 percent. In 1887, the French and British Rothschild banking houses loaned money to, and invested in, the [[De Beers]] diamond mines in [[South Africa]], becoming its largest shareholders.

The London banking house continued under the management of [[Lionel Nathan de Rothschild]] (1882–1942) and his brother [[Anthony Gustav de Rothschild]] (1887–1961), and then to [[Sir Evelyn de Rothschild]] (b. 1931). In 2003, following Sir Evelyn's retirement as head of N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons of London, the British and French financial firms merged under the leadership of [[David René de Rothschild]].

== French branches ==
{{Main article|Rothschild banking family of France}}
[[File:Chateau de Ferrieres.jpg|thumb|[[Château de Ferrières]], the largest château of the 19th century, was built in 1854. It is set on a {{convert|30|km²|0|abbr=on}} estate outside Paris. It was charitably donated by the family to the University of Paris in 1975.]]
There are two branches of the family connected to France.

The first was the branch of [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] (1792–1868), known as "James", who established [[de Rothschild Frères]] in Paris. Following the Napoleonic Wars, he played a major role in financing the construction of railways and the mining business that helped make France an industrial power. By 1980, the Paris business employed about 2,000 people and had an annual turnover of 26&amp;nbsp;billion francs (€4,13 billion or $5 billion in the currency rates of 1980).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1487391620070614 RPT-French banker Guy de Rothschild dies aged 98] Reuters, 14 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Paris business suffered a near death blow in 1982, when the socialist government of [[François Mitterrand]] nationalised and renamed it as Compagnie Européenne de Banque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Today, the Paris operation has 22 partners and accounts for a significant part of the global business.

Ensuing generations of the Paris Rothschild family remained involved in the family business, becoming a major force in international investment banking. The Paris Rothschilds have since led the [[Thomson Financial League Tables]] in Investment Banking Merger and Acquisition deals in the UK, France and Italy.

[[James Mayer de Rothschild]]'s other son, [[Edmond James de Rothschild]] (1845–1934), was very much engaged in philanthropy and the arts, and he was a leading proponent of [[Zionism]]. His grandson, Baron [[Edmond Adolphe de Rothschild]], founded in 1953 the [[LCF Rothschild Group]], a private bank. Since 1997, Baron [[Benjamin de Rothschild]] chairs the group. The group has €100bn of assets in 2008 and owns many wine properties in France ([[Château Clarke]], [[Château des Laurets]]), in Australia or in South Africa.

The second French branch was founded by [[Nathaniel de Rothschild]] (1812–1870). Born in London, he was the fourth child of the founder of the British branch of the family, [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] (1777–1836). In 1850 Nathaniel Rothschild moved to Paris to work with his uncle James Mayer Rothschild. In 1853 Nathaniel acquired Château Brane Mouton, a vineyard in [[Pauillac]] in the [[Gironde]] ''département''.  Nathaniel Rothschild renamed the estate [[Château Mouton Rothschild]], and it would become one of the best known labels in the world. In 1868, Nathaniel's uncle, James Mayer de Rothschild, acquired the neighbouring [[Château Lafite-Rothschild|Château Lafite]] vineyard.

Nevertheless, during the [[Second World War]] they had to surrender their bank to the [[Nazis]] and flee the country. Their [[Palais Rothschild|Rothschild palaces]], a collection of vast palaces in Vienna built and owned by the family, were confiscated, plundered and destroyed by the Nazis. The palaces were famous for their sheer size and for their huge collections of paintings, [[armour]], [[tapestries]] and [[statues]] (some of which were restored to the Rothschilds by the Austrian government in 1999). All family members escaped the [[Holocaust]], some of them moving to the [[United States]], and returning to Europe only after the war. In 1999, the government of Austria agreed to return to the Rothschild family some 250 art treasures looted by the Nazis and absorbed into state museums after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Naples branch ==
[[File:Villa Pignatelli and its garden, Naples.jpg|thumb|[[Villa Pignatelli]], Naples, with views onto Mount Vesuvius]]
{{Main article|Rothschild banking family of Naples}}
The C M de Rothschild &amp; Figli bank arranged substantial loans to the [[Papal States]] and to various Kings of Naples plus the Duchy of Parma and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. However, in the 1830s, Naples followed Spain with a gradual shift away from conventional bond issues that began to affect the bank's growth and profitability. The [[Unification of Italy]] in 1861, with the ensuing decline of the Italian aristocracy who had been the Rothschild's primary clients, eventually brought about the closure of their Naples bank, due to a forecasted decline in the sustainability of the business over the long-term. However, in the early 19th century, the Rothschild family of Naples built up close relations with the [[Holy See]], and the association between the family and the Vatican continued into the 20th century.{{fact|date=February 2018}} In 1832, when [[Pope Gregory XVI]] was seen meeting Carl von Rothschild to arrange the [[1832 Rothschild loan to the Holy See]] (for £400,000, worth €43,000,000 in 2014), observers were shocked that Rothschild was not required to kiss the Pope's feet, as was then required for all other visitors to the Pope, including monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;''The reign of the house of Rothschild'', Egon Caesar Corti (Conte), 1928, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; The 1906 ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' described the Rothschilds as "the guardians of the papal treasure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12909-rothschild "Rothschild"].  ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', 1901–1906, Vol. 2, p. 497.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jewish identity and positions on Zionism ==
Jewish solidarity in the family was not homogeneous. Many Rothschilds were supporters of [[Zionism]], while other members of the family opposed the creation of the Jewish state.  In 1917 [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild]] was the addressee of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]] to the [[Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland|Zionist Federation]],&lt;ref&gt;"Balfour Declaration."

Since the late-19th century, the family has taken a low-key public profile, donating many famous estates, as well as vast quantities of art, to charity, and generally eschewing conspicuous displays of wealth. Today, Rothschild businesses are on a smaller scale than they were throughout the 19th century, although they encompass a diverse range of fields, including: real estate, financial services, mixed farming, energy, mining, winemaking and nonprofits.&lt;ref name="The Rothschilds page 11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk" /&gt;

===The Rothschild Group===

=== Edmond de Rothschild Group ===
[[File:The Large Mansion at Gunnersbury ed.JPG|thumb|The Large Mansion at [[Gunnersbury Park]], London]]

In 1953, one Swiss member of the family, [[Edmond Adolphe de Rothschild]] (1926–1997), founded the LCF Rothschild Group (now [[Edmond de Rothschild Group]]) which is based in [[Geneva]], which today extends to 15 countries across the world. Although this Group is primarily a financial entity, specializing in asset management and private banking, its activities also cover mixed farming, luxury hotels and [[yacht racing]]. Edmond de Rothschild Group's committee is currently being chaired by [[Benjamin de Rothschild]], Baron Edmond's son.

In late 2010, [[Benjamin de Rothschild|Baron Benjamin Rothschild]] said that the family had been unaffected by the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]], due to their conservative business practices: "We came through it well, because our investment managers did not want to put money into crazy things." He added that the Rothschilds were still a small-scale, traditional family business and took greater care over their clients' investments than American companies, adding: "The client knows we will not speculate with his money".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Today, the Rothschild family owns many wine estates: their estates in France include [[Château Clarke]], Château de Malengin, [[Château Clerc-Milon]], [[Château d'Armailhac]], [[Château Duhart-Milon]], [[Château Lafite Rothschild]], Château de Laversine, [[Château des Laurets]], [[Château L'Évangile]], Château Malmaison, Château de Montvillargenne, [[Château Mouton Rothschild]], [[Château de la Muette]], [[Château Rieussec]] and Château Rothschild d'Armainvilliers. They also own wine estates across North America, South America, South Africa and Australia.

Especially, [[Château Mouton Rothschild]] and [[Château Lafite Rothschild]] are classified as '''Premier Cru Classé'''—i.e., [[First Growth]], the status referring to a classification of wines from the Bordeaux region of France.

=== Art and charity ===

In the words of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'': "This multinational banking family is a byword for wealth, power – and discretion... The Rothschild name has become synonymous with money and power to a degree that perhaps no other family has ever matched."&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Telegraph'' (London), ''The Rothschilds: They prefer to let their money do the talking'', William Langley, 25 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing of the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefeller]] and Rothschild families, [[Harry Mount]] writes: "That is what makes these two dynasties so exceptional – not just their dizzying wealth, but the fact that they have held on to it for so long: and not just the loot, but also their family companies."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/9300205/Rothschild-and-Rockefeller-their-family-fortunes.html Rothschild and Rockefeller: their family fortunes] Harry Mount, 30 May 2012, ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London)&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of the Rothschild family has been featured in a number of films. The 1934 Hollywood film titled ''[[The House of Rothschild]]'', starring [[George Arliss]] and [[Loretta Young]], recounted the life of [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]] and [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] (both played by Arliss). Excerpts from this film were incorporated into the Nazi propaganda film ''[[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|Der ewige Jude]]'' (''The Eternal Jew'') without the permission of the copyright holder. Another Nazi film, ''Die Rothschilds'' (also called ''Aktien auf Waterloo''), was directed by [[Erich Waschneck]] in 1940. A Broadway musical entitled ''[[The Rothschilds (musical)|The Rothschilds]]'', covering the history of the family up to 1818, was nominated for a [[Tony Award]] in 1971. [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Nathaniel Mayer ("Natty") Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild]] appears as a minor character in the historical-mystery novel ''[[Stone's Fall]]'', by [[Iain Pears]]. Mayer Rothschild is featured in [[Diana Gabaldon]]'s novel ''[[Voyager (novel)|Voyager]]'' as a coin seller summoned to Le Havre by Jamie Fraser to appraise coins, prior to the establishment of the Rothschild dynasty, when Mayer is in his early 20s. The Rothschild name is mentioned by [[Aldous Huxley]] in his novel ''[[Brave New World]]'', among many names of historically affluent persons, scientific innovators and others. The character, named Morgana Rothschild, played a relatively minor role in the story. The name Rothschild used as a synonym for extreme wealth inspired the song "[[If I Were a Rich Man (song)|If I Were a Rich Man]]", which is based on a song from the [[Tevye]] the Dairyman stories, written in the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] as ''Ven ikh bin Rotshild'', meaning "If I were a Rothschild".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lyricsmania.com/tradition_lyrics_fiddler_on_the_roof.html|title=Fiddler On The Roof - Tradition Lyrics|website=www.lyricsmania.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the word "Rothschild" was throughout the 19th and 20th centuries a synonym for seemingly endless wealth, neo-Gothic styles, and epicurean glamour.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rothschilds: Portrait of a Dynasty'', By Frederic Morton (1998), page 5&lt;/ref&gt; The family also has lent its name to "{{visible anchor|le [[goût Rothschild]]}}," a suffocatingly glamorous style of interior decoration whose elements include neo-Renaissance palaces, extravagant use of velvet and gilding, vast collections of armour and sculpture, a sense of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[horror vacui]], and the highest masterworks of art. Le goût Rothschild has much influenced designers such as [[Robert Denning]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Vincent Fourcade]] and others.

Discussing this and similar views, the historian [[Niall Ferguson]] wrote, {{quote|Without wars, nineteenth-century states would have little need to issue bonds. As we have seen, however, wars tended to hit the price of existing bonds by increasing the risk that a debtor state would fail to meet its interest payments in the event of defeat and losses of territory.

Now having made their money, they stood to lose more than they gained from conflict.

There was no Royal Governorship at the time of the "Protectorate", and the Governor technically answered to the Cromwellian Parliament, although Royalist sentiment was prevalent in the colony of Virginia at this time. The former Royalist governor Berkeley arrived to replace him March 13, 1660. 

==Biography==
Samuel Mathews (Jr.) was the elder son of [[Samuel Matthews]] (Sr.) (1572-1657) and Frances Grevill West Peirsey Mathews (1590-1635). He was born at his father's plantation, Mathews Manor, later known as [[Denbigh, Virginia|Denbigh]], which was located on the north side of the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] at Blunt Point, the confluence of the [[Warwick River (Virginia)|Warwick]] and the James rivers in the area which later became [[Warwick County, Virginia]] (and which is now within the city limits of [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]]).

The elder Samuel Mathews was the first of the Mathews family to emigrate from England to Virginia, arriving at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] by 1619. He eventually had several other land holdings, including one near [[Henricus]] and another at [[Old Point Comfort]]. Known as Colonel Mathews, the elder Samuel became one of the most prominent men in the colony. He was a member of the [[Governor's Council]] and was actively involved in conflicts with the [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]]. In 1635, he was one of the leaders of the popular mutiny that ousted Royal Governor Sir [[John Harvey (Virginia)|John Harvey]]. Upon returning to England, the elder Mathews was eventually cleared of any charges; upon returning to Virginia, he resumed service on the Governor's Council until 1644.&lt;ref&gt;http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/p/a/l/Jerry-M-Palmer/GENE9-0001.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Frances Grevill was one of four women who arrived at Jamestown from [[Bristol, England]] in September 1620 aboard the ship, ''Supply''. She was first married to Captain Nathaniel West, brother of Thomas West, the third [[Lord Delaware]], who had been governor of Virginia beginning in 1610. After West's death several years later, Grevill married Abraham Peirsey, a wealthy man who had purchased Sir [[George Yeardley]]'s [[Flowerdew Hundred Plantation]] after his death. Peirsey died several years later. Twice widowed, but with considerable legacies, she next married Samuel Mathews.

The younger Samuel Mathews, as an adult, was known as Lt. Colonel Samuel Mathews, reflecting his standing in the local militia. In 1652, he was named to the representative [[House of Burgesses]], which was the lower house of the legislature, on behalf of Warwick County. In 1656, he was appointed to the upper house, the [[Governor's Council]], and later that year, became the Commonwealth Governor of Virginia, a position held until his death in January 1660.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~marylove/Mathews/Mathews.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1658, mainly to signal their displeasure with [[Oliver Cromwell]], the Burgesses ceremonially dismissed him and reelected him in a single Act.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arthur |first=Timothy Shay |authorlink=Timothy Shay Arthur |title=The History of Virginia: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time |publisher=[[Lippincott, Grambo &amp; Co.]] |year=1852 |pages=14 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his loyalty, as governor, to Cromwell, he was often assumed to be a [[Puritan]] himself, although in fact he had been known as a persecutor of the Puritan sect in Virginia in the days before Cromwell.&lt;ref name="cooke"/&gt; 

In January 1660, shortly before the English Restoration, Matthews died in office, and the Burgesses at that point simply reinstated the former Royalist Governor, [[William Berkeley (governor)|William Berkeley]] by unanimous vote.&lt;ref name="Tyler48"&gt;Tyler, Lyon Gardiner, ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=UCgSAAAAYAAJ ''Encyclopedia of Virginia Biography'']. Volume 1. New York, Lewis Historical Publishing Company, 1915. {{OCLC|229136302}}. Retrieved February 16, 2013. p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the view of historian [[Robert Beverley, Jr.]] writing in 1705, Virginia colony "was the last of all the King's Dominions that submitted to the Usurpation, and afterwards the first that cast it off."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Beverley, ''The History and Present State of Virginia''&lt;/ref&gt; 

His brother Francis (1632-1673) outlived him. Governor Mathews married about 1655, but little information is known about his wife, other than some sources state she was of the Cole-Digges family. They had one son, John (b. 1659 - May 1, 1706) who married Elizabeth Tavernor on March 24, 1684. John also made his home at the Denbigh Plantation in Warwick County.

==Legacy==
Governor Samuel Mathews was an ancestor of Virginia's Brigadier General Thomas Mathews, who was the Speaker of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] for whom [[Mathews County, Virginia]] was named when it was formed by an Act of Assembly on May 1, 1791.

The site of Mathews Manor, located within the [[independent city]] of [[Newport News, Virginia]], was the subject of an archeological study led by [[Colonial Williamsburg]]'s [[Ivor Noel Hume]] in the 1960s, and was placed on the [[National Park Service]]'s [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/jamesriver/mat.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Ndashyikirwa''', formerly a [[small business]]man in [[Kirwa, Rwanda]], was convicted in [[Belgium]] on June 29, 2005 for his role in the [[Rwandan genocide]] of 1994.  Eyewitnesses testified that he had been present at [[massacre]]s in Kirwa and had been directly involved with the killings, and prosecutors argued that he and his half-brother, [[Etienne Nzabonimana]], provided [[vehicle]]s, [[weapon]]s, and [[beer]] for Rwandan soldiers committing genocide in the [[Kibungo]] region.  Both were convicted of aiding [[Hutu]] [[militia]]s in killing 50,000 [[Tutsi]]s and moderate [[Hutu]]s.  Ndashyikirwa will serve ten years in prison, while his half-brother will serve twelve.

Stratfor bills itself as a geopolitical intelligence platform, with revenues derived from individual and enterprise subscriptions to Stratfor Worldview, its online publication, and from custom advisory work for corporate clients.

Stratfor has published a daily intelligence briefing since its inception in 1996. Its rise to prominence occurred with the release of its Kosovo Crisis Center during the 1999 [[NATO]] airstrikes over [[Kosovo]], which led to publicity in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine, ''[[Texas Monthly]]'', and other publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,18728,00.html "Spies Like Us"], ''Time'', January 25, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of 1999, however, Stratfor had introduced a subscription service through which it offered the majority of its analyses. At the time of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Stratfor made its "breaking news" paragraphs, as well as some notable analyses predicting likely actions to be taken by [[al-Qaeda]] and the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration, available freely to the public.

Stratfor's publishing business includes written and multimedia analysis available online or through an API, as well as [[iPhone]] and Android mobile applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratfor.com/tour/products/ Stratfor products] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927170349/http://www.stratfor.com/tour/products/ |date=2009-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stratfor Threat Lens, an enterprise level product launched in September 2016, offers specific insight and analysis to support [[corporate security]] leaders. In April 2017, the company launched its core online publication under the name [https://worldview.stratfor.com/ Stratfor Worldview]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/multimedia-update-stratfor-launches-worldview-revolutionizes-access-geopolitical-intelligence-2212225.htm|title=Stratfor Launches Worldview, Revolutionizes Access to Geopolitical Intelligence, Analysis and Forecasting|last=|first=|date=April 26, 2017|website=Marketwired|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of Stratfor's work remains available free to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stratfor.com/free-reports|title=Stratfor's Free Intelligence Reports|publisher=Stratfor|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books and media==
Stratfor has published collections of analysis in paperback and as e-books on a variety of topics. Topics include user guides to personal security,&lt;ref name="The Wall Street Shuffle podcast'"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cofall|first1=Dan|title=The Wall Street Shuffle|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqL3UjTZ9Ws|accessdate=9 July 2014|agency=NorAm Asset Management|date=April 19, 2010|ref=http://www.thewallstreetshuffle.com/category/previous-podcasts/page/2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "devolution of jihadism," and the U.S. war in Afghanistan, according to a series of promotional videos on the company's YouTube channel. Apparently, at one point, the books were sold through a storefront on the company's website. Stratfor e-books and long form analyses are now available through a [https://store.stratfor.com/ dedicated, on-site store].

A number of the company's top analysts have published books in their own name. Notable among these are founder [[George Friedman]] and vice president for intelligence [[Fred Burton (security expert)|Fred Burton]]. Kamran Bokhari, Stratfor's former vice president for Middle East and [[South Asian]] affairs, is the author (with Farid Senzai) of ''Political Islam in the Age of Democratization'' ([[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2013). Reviewer Amani el Sehrawey called the book "an invaluable tool for those seeking to gain knowledge of the nuances of the political systems of the Muslim world from a historical perspective, as well as to understand the contemporary changes happening in the region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=El Sehrawey|first1=Amani|title=Book Review: Political Islam in the Age of Democratization by Kamran Bokhari and Farid Senzai|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2014/03/02/book-review-political-islam-in-the-age-of-democratization-by-kamran-bokhari-and-farid-senzai/#Author|website=European Politics and Policy|publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science|accessdate=9 July 2014|ref=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Barron's Magazine|Barron's]]'' once referred to Stratfor as "The Shadow CIA".&lt;ref name="Barrons"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB1002927557434087960.html |title=The Shadow CIA |last=Laing |first=Jonathan R. |publisher=Barron's magazine |date=October 15, 2001 |accessdate=December 19, 2010 }} ([http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/archive.cgi?read=13032 read complete article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601025407/http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/archive.cgi?read=13032 |date=2011-06-01 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Barrons' Jonathan Laing has called Friedman "one of our favorite experts on geopolitics," saying, "His judgments tend to be more nuanced and long-term than those of the press or Wall Street."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laing|first1=Jonathan|title=Putin's Big Miscalculation|url=http://online.barrons.com/news/articles/SB50001424053111904537004580094312032577890?mod=BOL_twm_col|accessdate=19 August 2014|publisher=Barrons|date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, ''The Atlantic'''s [[James Fallows]] referenced a Stratfor article on U.S. strategy in Iraq and Ukraine, following outbreaks of turmoil in those regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fallows|first1=James|title=Stratfor on American Grand Strategy in Iraq and Ukraine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/06/stratfor-on-american-grand-strategy-in-iraq-and-ukraine/373308/|accessdate=9 July 2014|work=National correspondent|agency=The Atlantic|date=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedman resigned from the company in 2015 to launch a new company, Geopolitical Futures.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Colin (December 3, 2015).

The '''Whitfield family''' was a prominent slave-owning [[List of United States political families|American political family]] of the [[Southern United States|Southern states]], and of the Northern United States having established https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Whitfield_House the Henry Whitfield House in 1639 in the town of Guilford, Connecticut.  Historically, it is Connecticut's oldest house. The house, with its massive stone walls, also served as a fort to protect the community Henry Whitfield, for whom the house was built, was a Puritan minister who had come from England to flee religious persecution The house was remodeled in 1868 and opened to the public in 1899 as the first museum of the State of Connecticut, the Henry Whitfield State Museum. The house was restored in 1902–04 and in the 1930s and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997. It was named a State Archeological Preserve in 2006.

In the Southern States, the Whitfields formed the American branch of the British [[Whitfield family]] - having descended from the [[British aristocracy]], particularly the [[Earls of Kilmorey]] and having established colonial residency under Sir. Thomas Whitfield, whom headed East India Trading for the British Empire. In early days of [[Colonial America]], the family [[First Families of Virginia|emigrated to Virginia]] in the seventeenth century, particularly, [[Nansemond County, Virginia]] from [[Lancashire, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Connelley|first= William Elsey|date= 1923|title= History Of Kentucky, Volume 5|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Vi8VAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=Nabu Press |page= 914|isbn=978-1273257155 |access-date=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hathaway|first= James Robert Bent|date= 1900|title=

Along with his son, he was a Director and Trustee for designing and building the town of [[Goldsboro, North Carolina|Wanesboro]]. He had 29 children&lt;ref&gt;[http://walkofhonor.com/whitfield_william_army.html Whitfield, William, Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge]&lt;/ref&gt; and forty of his descendants served in the [[confederate army]] during the American Civil war.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

This included, [[Nathan Bryan Whitfield]], William III's nephew, who became the Counselor of State for the State of North Carolina and was a State Senator. He was later commissioned to [[Major General]] rank to succeed his father for the militia. His son, Dr. Bryan Watkins Whitfield, was [[List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the President of the United States|pardoned]] by U.S. President [[Andrew Johnson]] on September 12, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67161672 Dr Bryan Watkins Whitfield] at [[Find a Grave]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaineswood]], which still stands today, was the most significant remaining examples of [[Greek Revival architecture]] in Alabama.&lt;ref name="gamble"&gt;Gamble, Robert ''Historic architecture in Alabama: a guide to styles and types, 1810-1930'', page 76.

Whitfield is known to have designed most of the house from pattern books by [[James Stuart (1713-1788)|James Stuart]], [[Minard Lafever]], [[Nicholas Revett]] and others.&lt;ref name="marengo"/&gt;  Much of the work on the house was executed by highly skilled [[artisan]] slaves.&lt;ref name="Gaineswood"/&gt; Whitfield moved from [[North Carolina]] to Marengo County, Alabama in 1834.  In 1842 Whitfield bought the {{convert|480|acre|km2|adj=on}} property from [[George Strother Gaines]], younger brother of [[Edmund P. Gaines]].

Much of the work on the house was executed by highly skilled [[artisan]] slaves.&lt;ref name="Gaineswood"/&gt; The grounds had been the site of a notable historic event while owned by George Gaines.  When Gaines was serving as the US [[Indian Agent]], he is said to have met with the famous [[Tribal chief|chief]] [[Pushmataha]], of the [[Choctaw]] Nation, under an old [[post oak]] tree on what would become the Gaineswood estate.  They were negotiating the terms of the treaty that would lead to the Choctaw [[Indian removal|removal]] to [[Indian Territory]].  The tree became known as the Pushmataha Oak.&lt;ref name="hammond"&gt;Hammond, Ralph ''Ante-bellum Mansions of Alabama'', pages 114-120.  New York: Architectural Book Publishers, 1951. {{ISBN|0-517-02075-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitfield first named the estate Marlmont in 1843; he renamed it Gaineswood in 1856 in honor of Gaines.&lt;ref name="marengo"&gt;Marengo County Heritage Book Committee: ''The heritage of Marengo County, Alabama'', page 18. Clanton, Alabama: Heritage Publishing Consultants, 2000. {{ISBN|1-891647-58-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Whitfield family tradition maintained that Gaines' original log house was the nucleus around which Whitfield had the mansion built, and that it was located at the present site of the south entrance hall and office.&lt;ref name="Gaineswood"&gt;"{{cite web|title=Gaineswood|work="Alabama Historical Commission"|url=http://www.preserveala.org/gaineswood.aspx?sm=g_i|accessdate=2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gen. Whitfield sold the house to his son, Dr. Bryan Watkins Whitfield, in 1861. The second generation of Whitfields maintained Gaineswood as a residence. Mary Foscue Whitfield inherited the nearby [[Foscue-Whitfield House]] in 1861 upon her father's death and used that as a residence as well.&lt;ref name="marengo"/&gt; For later descendants, post Civil War, the lands and plantations were sold.
