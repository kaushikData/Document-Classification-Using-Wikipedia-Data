==Life and career==
Albert Raboteau was born into a Catholic family in [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]], three months after his father, Albert Jordy Raboteau (1899–1943), was killed there by a white man. The boy was named for his late father, &lt;ref&gt;Albert J. Raboteau, ''A Sorrowful Joy: A Spiritual Journey of an African-American Man in Late Twentieth-Century America'' (Paulist Press, 2002: {{ISBN|0-8091-4093-4}}), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; who was of African and French Creole descent. His father was killed in an era of white supremacy and legal racial discrimination in the state: the man who killed his father claimed self-defense and was never prosecuted for the crime.&lt;ref name=dribilllong&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His widowed mother moved the family from Mississippi, where she was a teacher, to find a better place in the North for her children to grow up.&lt;ref name= dribilllong/&gt; She married again, to an African-American minister. They lived in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] for a period and in California. Raboteau's stepfather taught the boy [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] starting at the age of five years, and helped him to focus on church and education as he grew up. Raboteau attended Catholic parochial and high schools. At age 11 he traveled with other choir boys from St. Thomas Catholic Church of Ann Arbor to sing in an international choir festival at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://aadl.org/taxonomy/term/121563 "St. Thomas Catholic Church Choir Boys Apply For Passports To Rome, April 1954"], ''Ann Arbor News'', 3 April 1954; "Something to Sing About", ''Ann Arbor News'', April 18 April 1954; accessed 28 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

Raboteau was accepted into college at the age of sixteen. He earned his BA at [[Loyola Marymount University|Loyola University]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1964 and an MA in English from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;Wardell J. Payne (ed.), ''Directory of African American Religious Bodies: A Compendium by the Howard University School of Divinity'' (Howard University Press, 1995: {{ISBN|0-88258-184-8}}), p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Raboteau married and started a family.&lt;ref name= dribilllong /&gt;

Raboteau entered the [[Yale]] Graduate Program in Religious Studies, where he studied with American religious historian [[Sydney Ahlstrom]] and African-American historian [[John Blassingame]], receiving his PhD in 1974. Raboteau's dissertation, later revised and published as the book ''Slave Religion: The "Invisible Institution" in the Antebellum South,'' was published just as the black studies movement was gaining steam in the 1970s. It was a time of revolutionary scholarship on American slavery: Blassingame's ''Slave Community'' (1972) and ''Slave Testimony'' (1977); [[Eugene Genovese]]'s ''Roll, Jordan, Roll'' (1974), Olli Alho's ''The Religion of Slaves'' (1976), and Lawrence Levine's ''Black Culture and Black Consciousness'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Raboteau, "Afterword," ''Slave Religion,'' updated edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 [[Princeton University]] hired Raboteau, first as a visiting professor and then as full-time faculty. He is Henry W. Putnam Professor of Religion. His research and teaching focus on American Catholic history, African-American religions, and religion and immigration issues.  He chaired the Department of Religion (1987–92) and also served as dean of the Graduate School (1992–93). He received the Lifetime Service Award (Journey Award) in both 2005 and 2006. In 2005, he also received the special Achievement Award (Journey Award). In 2013 Raboteau retired but continues to teach as a professor emeritus. He is studying "the place of beauty in the history of Eastern and Western Christian Spirituality."&lt;ref name="religion"/&gt; 

In the late 20th century, Raboteau converted to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] at a time of personal crisis and divorce from his first wife.&lt;ref name= dribilllong /&gt; At the time of his conversion, he took the name ''Panteleimon'', meaning the "all merciful."&lt;ref&gt;Albert J. Raboteau, ''A Sorrowful Joy: A Spiritual Journey of an African-American Man in Late Twentieth-Century America'', Paulist Press, 2002, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; He serves as lay coordinator of Mother of God Joy of All Who Sorrow Orthodox Mission in [[Rocky Hill, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incommunion.org/articles/conferences-lectures/the-african-american-witness  Raboteau, A.

{{Culture of Bangladesh}}
{{Bengalis}} 

'''Architecture of Bangladesh''' refers to the architectural attributes and styles of [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name="bangla"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/51736/Bangladesh/277578/Visual-art-and-architecture
|title=Visual art and architecture in Bangladesh
|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica
|accessdate=6 September 2009
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture of Bangladesh has a long history and is rooted in Bangladesh's [[Culture of Bangladesh|culture]], [[Religion in Bangladesh|religion]] and [[History of Bangladesh|history]].&lt;ref name="banglapedia"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Architecture
|title=Architecture
|publisher=Banglapedia
|accessdate=6 September 2009
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It has evolved over centuries and assimilated influences from social, religious and exotic communities. The architecture of Bangladesh bears a remarkable impact on the lifestyle, tradition and cultural life of [[Bangladeshi people]]. Bangladesh has many architectural relics and monuments dating back thousands of years.

==Pala Buddhist architecture==
[[File:Naqi model.jpg|thumb|250px|left|8th-century monastery [[Somapura Mahavihara]]]] 
The [[Pala Empire]] was an early Indian empire of Bengali [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] dynasty ruling from Bengal (which included present day [[Bangladesh]]) from the 8th to the 12th centuries. The Palas created a distinctive form of Bengali architecture and art known as the "Pala School of Sculptural Art." The gigantic structures of Vikramashila Vihar, Odantpuri Vihar, and Jagaddal Vihar were masterpieces of the Palas. These mammoth structures were destroyed by the forces of the infamous [[Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad Bin Bakhtiyar Khalji|Bakhtiar Khilji]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The [[Somapura Mahavihara]], a creation of [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]], at Paharpur, Bangladesh, is the largest Buddhist Vihara in the Indian subcontinent, and has been described as a "pleasure to the eyes of the world." [[UNESCO]] made it a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1985. The Pala architectural style was followed throughout south-eastern Asia and China, Japan, and [[Tibet]]. Bengal rightfully earned the name "Mistress of the East". Dr. [[Stella Kramrisch]] says: "The art of Bihar and Bengal exercised a lasting influence on that of [[Nepal]], Burma, [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] and [[Java]]." Dhiman and Vittpala were two celebrated Pala sculptors. About Somapura Mahavihara, Mr. J.C. French says with grief: "For the research of the [[Pyramid]]s of [[Egypt]] we spend millions of dollars every year. But had we spent only one percent of that money for the excavation of Somapura Mahavihara, who knows what extraordinary discoveries could have been made".&lt;ref&gt;The Art of the Pala Empire or Bengal, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islamic and Mughal architecture ==

The Sultanate of Bengal was an era of the Central Asian origin Muslim Nawab dynasty that ruled independently of the [[Mughal Empire]] from 1342 to 1576. Most of the Muslim architecture of the period is found in the historic [[Gaur region]], today's [[Rajshahi division]] and [[Malda district]] in [[West Bengal]]. The architecture of the period is noted for the development of a uniquely local style influenced by Bengali architectural traditions. [[Bengal Sultanate|Sultanate]] architecture is exemplified in structures such as the [[Sixty Dome Mosque|Shat Gombuj Masjid]], the [[Sona Mosque|Shona Masjid]] and the [[Kusumba Mosque|Kusumba Masjid]].&lt;ref&gt; http://archnet.org/system/publications/contents/4129/original/dpt0826.pdf?1384779803&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1576, much of Bengal came under the control of the [[Mughal Empire]]. At the time, Dhaka emerged as Mughal military base. The development of townships and housing had resulted in a significant growth in population, as the town was proclaimed by [[Subahdar]] [[Islam Khan I]] as capital of [[Bengal Subah]] in 1608, during this time many mosques and forts had been built. [[Bara Katra]] was built between 1644 and 1646 CE to be the official residence of Mughal prince [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]], the second son of emperor [[Shah Jahan]].

Indian Mughal architecture in present-day Bangladesh reached its peak during the reign of [[Subedar]]
[[Shaista Khan]], who encouraged the construction of modern townships and public works in Dhaka, leading to a massive urban and economic expansion. He was a patron of the arts and encouraged the construction of majestic monuments across the province, including [[mosque]]s, [[mausoleum]]s and palaces that represented the finest in [[Mughal architecture]]. Khan greatly expanded [[Lalbagh Fort]] (also Fort Aurangabad), [[Chawk Mosque|Chowk Bazaar Mosque]], [[Saat Masjid]] and [[Choto Katra]]. He also supervised the construction of the mausoleum for his daughter Bibi Pari.

==Terracotta temple architecture==
Much of the terracotta temple architecture in Bangladesh dates to the late Islamic period and early British period during which wealthy Hindu zamindars commissioned these structures.
* Temple architecture styles:
**[[ek-bangla]], have a curved roof with two sloping sides
**[[Jor-bangla]], has a roof of the ek-bangla (or do-chala) style, with two curved segments that meet at a curved ridge
**[[ek-chala]], single-story or has a second story built into a sloping roof
**[[Do-chala]], have a curved roof with two sloping sides
**[[Char-chala]],  have a curved roof composed of four triangular segments
**[[At-chala]], base structure is similar to the four-sided char-chala temple style, but with a small replica of the base temple on top
**[[Deul]], were generally smaller and included features influenced by Islamic architecture
**[[Ek-ratna]], base structure is similar to the four-sided char-chala temple style, but the roof is quite different, flat with a tower in the centre. 
**[[Pancharatna (architecture)|Pancharatna]], has five pavilions or towers on the roof; four stand at the corners of the main level, and one above.
**[[Navaratna (architecture)|Navaratna]], incorporates two main levels, each with four spired corner pavilions, and a central pavilion above, for a total of nine spires.

== Common Bungalow Style Architecture ==
[[File:Village in Pirojpur.jpg|thumb|Village in a clearing Sundarbans, by Frederic Peter Layard, January 1839]]
The origin of the [[bungalow]] has its roots in the historical [[Bengal Presidency|Province of Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proz.com/kudoz/english/education_pedagogy/700411-bungalow.html|title=bungalow|work=proz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''baṅgalo'', meaning  "[[Bengal]]i" and used [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|elliptically]] for a "house in the [[Bengal]] style".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', "bungalow"; [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=bungalow&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Such houses were traditionally small, only one storey and detached, and had a wide [[veranda]] were adapted by the British, who used them as houses for colonial administrators in summer retreats in the Himalayas and in compounds outside Indian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/12/B0551200.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308171939/http://www.bartleby.com/61/12/B0551200.html|title=bungalow. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000.|archivedate=8 March 2008|work=bartleby.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Bungalow style houses are still very popular in the rural Bengal. In the rural areas of Bangladesh, it is often called ''Bangla Ghar'' (Bengali Style House). The main construction material used in modern time is corrugated steel sheets. Previously they had been constructed from wood, bamboo and a kind of straw called ''Khar''. Khar was used in the roof of the Bungalow house and kept the house cold during hot summer days. Another roofing material for Bungalow houses has been red clay tiles.

==Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture==
In the British colonial age predominantly representative buildings of the Indo-European style developed, from a mixture of mainly Indian, European and Central Asian (Islamic) components. Amongst the more prominent works are [[Ahsan Manzil]] in [[Dhaka]] and [[Tajhat Palace]] in [[Rangpur City]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Modern Bangladeshi Architecture==
In modern context, Bangladeshi architecture has become more diversified comprising reflections of contemporary architectural attributes, aesthetic and technologically advanced aspects. Since the [[Independence of Bangladesh|inception of Bangladesh]], economical advancement has boosted the architecture from its traditional forms to contemporary context. With the growing urbanization and modernization, the architectural form is turning into modernity covering a wide range of its heritage and tradition.&lt;ref name="banglapedia"/&gt; The architecture of Bangladesh can provide insight into the history and lives of the Bangladeshi people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladesh.com/architecture/|title=Appealing Architecture – From Ancient Treasures to Contemporary Landmarks|accessdate=28 December 2009 |publisher=Bangladesh.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100108033246/http://www.bangladesh.com/architecture/| archivedate= 8 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Buskin (PSF).jpg|thumb|Buskins]]
A '''buskin''' is a knee- or calf-length [[boot]] made of [[leather]] or [[cloth]] which laces closed, but is open across the toes. It was worn by [[Tragedy|Athenian tragic]] actors, hunters, and soldiers in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]], [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] societies.
 
The word buskin, only recorded in [[English language|English]] since 1503 meaning "half boot", is of unknown origin, perhaps from [[Old French]] ''brousequin'' (in modern [[French language|French]] ''brodequin'') or directly from its [[Middle Dutch]] model ''brosekin'' "small leather boot". Figurative senses relating to tragedy are from the word being used (since 1570) to translate [[Greek language|Greek]] '''''kothornos''''' ({{lang-el|κόθορνος}}) or Latin '''''cothurnus''''', the high, thick-soled boot worn in Athenian tragedy; contrasted with [[sock]] (from Latin '''''soccus'''''), the low shoe worn by [[Comedy (drama)|comedians]].

[[Byzantine emperor]]s were formally clad in purple buskins, embroidered in gold with [[double-headed eagle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;John Julius Norwich, ''A Short History of Byzantium'', Penguin 1998, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roman Catholic Church ==
{{main|Episcopal sandals}}
In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], buskins are ceremonial liturgical [[stocking]]s (''caligae'' in [[Latin]]) of [[silk]], sometimes interwoven with gold threads and even heavily embroidered, formerly worn by the [[Officiant|celebrant]] of a [[pontifical Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03087b.htm |title=Buskin |work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buskins can be worn over the [[episcopal sandals]], regular dress socks with regular dress shoes, or over the red [[papal shoes]] worn by the [[Pope]].

Originally liturgical buskins were worn by all priests, until about the eighth century when they were reserved for the exclusive use of [[bishop]]s as part of the [[pontificalia]], i.e. episcopal "[[regalia]]", a privilege in modern times extended to some lesser [[prelate]]s. In [[liturgical colours|liturgical colour]] they correspond to the [[chasuble]], but are never worn with black.

[[File:Lassen2.jpg|thumb|Christian Lassen. Drawing by [[Adolf Hohneck]], 1859.]]
'''Christian Lassen''' (October 22, 1800 – May 8, 1876) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]]-born [[oriental studies|orientalist]] and professor of Old Indian language and literature at the University of Bonn.

==Life==
He was born at [[Bergen, Norway]]. Having received a university education at [[Oslo]], he went to Germany and continued his studies at the [[University of Heidelberg]] and the [[University of Bonn]]. In Bonn, Lassen acquired a sound knowledge of [[Sanskrit]]. He spent three years in [[Paris, France|Paris]] and London, engaged in copying and collating manuscripts, and collecting materials for future research, especially with reference to [[Hindu]] drama and philosophy. During this period he published, jointly with [[Eugène Burnouf]], his first work, ''Essai sur le Pâli'' (Paris, 1826).

On his return to Bonn he studied [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and took the degree of Ph.D., his dissertation discussing the Arabic notices of the geography of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] (''Commentario geographica historica de Pentapotamia Indica'', Bonn, 1827). Soon after he was admitted ''[[Privatdozent]]'', and in 1830 was appointed extraordinary and in 1840 ordinary professor of Old Indian language and literature. In spite of a tempting offer from [[Copenhagen]], in 1841, Lassen remained faithful to the university of his adoption to the end of his life. He died at Bonn, having been affected with almost total blindness for many years. As early as 1864 he was allowed to give up lecturing.

==Work==
In 1829-1831 he brought out, in conjunction with [[August Wilhelm von Schlegel]], a critical annotated edition of the [[Hitopadesha|''Hitopadeśa'']]. The appearance of this edition marks the starting-point of the critical study of Sanskrit literature. At the same time Lassen assisted von Schlegel in editing and translating the first two cantos of the epic [[Ramayana|''Rāmāyana'']] (1829-1838). In 1832 he brought out the text of the first act of [[Bhavabhuti]]'s drama, [[Bhavabhuti#Malatimadhava|''Mālatīmādhava'']], and a complete edition, with a [[Latin]] translation, of the ''Sānkhya-kārikā''. In 1837 followed his edition and translation of Jayadeva's charming lyrical drama, [[Gita Govinda|''Gītagovinda'']] and his ''Institutiones linguae Pracriticae''.

[[File:Agathukleyasa Agathokles.jpg|thumb|Equivalent legends ''Agathuklayesa'' (Brahmi) and  ''Agathokles'' (Greek) on a bilingual coin of [[Agathocles of Bactria|Agathocles]], used by Lassen to decipher securely the first Brahmi letters.&lt;ref name=RHP/&gt;]]
His ''Anthologia Sanscritica'', which came out the following year, contained several hitherto unpublished texts, and did much to stimulate the study of Sanskrit in German universities. In 1846 Lassen brought out an improved edition of Schlegel's text and translation of the "[[Bhagavad Gita]]".

As well as the study of Indian languages, he was a scientific pioneer in other fields of philological inquiry. In his ''Beiträge zur Deutung der Eugubinischen Tafeln'' (1833) he prepared the way for the correct interpretation of the [[Umbria]]n inscriptions; and the ''Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes'' (7 vols., 1837-1850), started and largely conducted by him, contains, among other valuable papers from his pen, grammatical sketches of the Beluchi and Brahui languages, and an essay on the Lycian inscriptions.

Soon after the appearance of Burnouf's ''Commentaire sur le Yacna'' (1833), Lassen also directed his attention to the [[Zend language]], and to [[Iran]]ian studies generally; and in ''Die altpersischen Keilinschriften von Persepolis'' (1836) he first made known the true character of the Old Persian [[Cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] inscriptions, thereby anticipating, by one month, Burnouf's ''Mémoire'' on the same subject, while [[Sir Henry Rawlinson]]'s famous memoir on the [[Behistun Inscription]], though drawn up in Persia, independently of contemporaneous European research, at about the same time, did not reach the Royal Asiatic Society until three years later.

Subsequently, Lassen published, in the sixth volume of his journal (1845), a collection of all the Old Persian cuneiform inscriptions known up to that date. He also was the first scholar in Europe who took up, with signal success, the decipherment of the newly discovered Bactrian coins, which furnished him the materials for ''Zur Geschichte der griechischen und indoskythsschen Könige in Bakterien, Kabul, und Indien'' (1838).

The first successful attempts at deciphering Brahmi were made in 1836 by Christian Lassen, who used the bilingual Greek-Brahmi coins of [[Indo-Greek]] kings [[Agathocles of Bactria|Agathocles]] and [[Pantaleon]] to correctly identify several Brahmi letters.&lt;ref name=RHP&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ray |first1=Himanshu Prabha |title=Buddhism and Gandhara: An Archaeology of Museum Collections |date=2017 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9781351252744 |page=181 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MiBBDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT181 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task was then completed by [[James Prinsep]], who was able to identify the rest of the Brahmi characters, with the help of [[Major Cunningham]].&lt;ref name=RHP/&gt;

He contemplated bringing out a critical edition of the ''Vendidad''; but, after publishing the first five fargards (1852), he felt that his whole energies were required for the successful accomplishment of the great undertaking of his life—his ''Indische Altertumskunde''. In this work—completed in four volumes, published respectively in 1847 (2nd ed., 1867), 1849 (2nd ed., 1874), 1858 and 1861—which forms one of the greatest monuments of untiring industry and critical scholarship, everything that could be gathered from native and foreign sources, relative to the political, social and intellectual development of [[India]]. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1868.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter L|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterL.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ringwall von Burg Rekonstr.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of the circular rampart of Burg, near [[Celle]], Germany]]
A '''circular rampart''' (German: ''Ringwall'') is an embankment built in the shape of a [[circle]] that was used as part of the defences for a military fortification, [[hill fort]] or refuge, or was built for religious purposes or as a place of gathering.

The period during which these structures appeared stretches from the [[Neolithic]] to the [[Middle Ages]].

==Construction==
[[File:VarbolaRuins.jpg|thumb|[[Varbola Stronghold|Varbola]] ruins in [[Estonia]]]]
The key feature of a circular [[Rampart (fortification)|rampart]] is the [[Earthworks (engineering)#Military use|embankment]] forming the primary means of the defensive fortification. It can be constructed in various ways: as a simple earth embankment, as a wood and earth structure or as a wall. Circular ramparts usually have a [[moat]] or [[Ditch (fortification)|ditch]] in front of them; the embankment can be enhanced with a wooden [[palisade]]. Often several concentric rings were built, which produced a more effective defensive position against attackers. The interior of such sites often shows evidence of buildings such as halls, barns and other secondary structures.

==Locations==
[[File:Ringwall von Burg Mauer.jpg|thumb|External view of the Burg site]]
[[File:Ringwall von Burg Krone.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Top of the rampart at Burg]]
Circular ramparts are found in north and western Europe, for example, in [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], [[Great Britain]], Belgium and the Netherlands; in central Europe, in [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]; in southeastern Europe in [[Romania]], [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]];&lt;ref&gt;Cucuteni-Trypillian culture#Settlements&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the [[United States]]. They are often hidden in woods and discovered by aerial photography. Archaeological profiles through the defences and excavations of the interior enable analysis of the period the site was occupied, the pottery used and the type of food consumed.

The '''Columbia Amusement Company''', also called the '''Columbia Wheel''' or the '''Eastern Burlesque Wheel''', was an industry organization that arranged [[American burlesque|burlesque]] company bookings in American theaters between 1902 and 1927. The burlesque companies would travel in succession round a "wheel" of theaters, ensuring steady employment for performers and a steady supply of new shows for the participating theaters. For much of its history the Columbia Wheel advertised relatively "clean" variety shows featuring pretty girls. Eventually the wheel was forced out of business due to competition from  cinemas and from the cruder stock burlesque companies.

==Background==

The [[Theatrical Syndicate]] was formed in 1896 by the theatrical managers or booking agents [[Charles Frohman]], [[Al Hayman]], [[A. L. Erlanger]], [[Marc Klaw]], [[Samuel F. Nirdlinger]] and [[J. Fred Zimmerman, Sr.|Frederick Zimmerman]]. 
The syndicate soon dominated legitimate theater, deciding what would be shown and where.{{sfn|Cullen|Hackman|McNeilly|2004|p=252}}
The [[Vaudeville Managers Association]] was founded soon after, with similar goals, and the United Booking Office was founded to provide a single place where performers could seek engagements.{{sfn|Cullen|Hackman|McNeilly|2004|p=252}}

In 1897, the burlesque producers and theater managers incorporated the Traveling Variety Managers of America (TVMA)--with the purpose of bettering the business of traveling variety managers and for benevolent, literary and fraternal purposes. The directors were Thomas E. Miaco, Henry C. Jacobs and Thomas E. McCready. Among the incorporators were Gus Hill, Phil Sheridan, Frank D. Bryan, George W. Rice and Fred Irwin.&lt;ref&gt;Poughkeepsie Eagle-News (Poughkeepsie, NY) 'Traveling Variety Managers-New Organization' 23 Jul 1897 Page 2 Column 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was that approved shows would progress from one theater to another in succession, round a "wheel".{{sfn|Cullen|Hackman|McNeilly|2004|p=252}}The vaudeville and burlesque producer [[Gus Hill]] claimed credit for the concept.{{sfn|Cullen|Hackman|McNeilly|2004|p=510}}The theaters would not have to compete for shows, and the burlesque companies would have guaranteed work. The TVMA soon split into two wheels, one in the west and the other in the east.{{sfn|Cullen|Hackman|McNeilly|2004|p=252}}

==Formation==
[[File:ThemAsIsBecauseNY1911Scribner.jpg|thumb|1911 cartoon depicting [[Sam A. Scribner]] and the Columbia Wheel]]
Sixteen managers and producers incorporated the Columbia Amusement Company on 12 July 1902.{{sfn|Winchester|1995|p=16}}
They had left the TVMA to set up a more stable operation.
The lead was taken by [[Sam A. Scribner]]. Other principals were William S. Campbell, William S. Drew, Gus Hill, John Herbert Mack, Harry Morris, [[L. Lawrence Weber]] and A. H. Woodhill.{{sfn|Cullen|Hackman|McNeilly|2004|p=253}}
The circuit had headquarter in New York and included the larger cities east of the Missouri and north of the Ohio such as Philadelphia and Pittsburg. It included Montreal and Toronto in Canada, and Boston in the east.{{sfn|Columbia Wheel Shows, Reading Eagle 1922}}
Since the theaters were in the east, the Columbia Wheel was also called the Eastern Wheel. 
Another circuit was formed in the west, called the Empire Circuit or Western Wheel.{{sfn|Cullen|Hackman|McNeilly|2004|p=253}}

==Early years==
The Columbia organizers at first aimed to provide affordable shows that were acceptable to women and men.{{sfn|Cullen|Hackman|McNeilly|2004|p=253}}
They advertised "clean" or "refined" burlesque.{{sfn|Allen|1991|p=191-192}}
They included lines of chorus girls and slightly risqué comedians, but did not go so far as to give offense.{{sfn|Cullen|Hackman|McNeilly|2004|p=253}}
The Columbia Wheel's refined burlesque shows had multi-act vaudeville-style programs that included farces, comedians, skits and variety acts. In August 1905 [[Will Rogers]] signed up with Scribner for five one-week shows in Brooklyn, New York, Buffalo, Cleveland and Pittsburg.{{sfn|Dodge|Rogers|2000|p=183}}

Although the wheel system made the industry more stable, the shows became standardized. New costumes and acts were expensive, and when performers became better known they often left for legitimate theater.{{sfn|Briggeman|2004|p=12}}
Performers who started in burlesque included [[Joe Weber (vaudevillian)|Weber]] &amp; [[Lew Fields|Fields]], [[Bert Lahr]], [[W. C. Fields]], [[Red Skelton]], [[Sophie Tucker]] and [[Fanny Brice]]. All of them moved into musical comedy or vaudeville as soon as they could.{{sfn|Wagenknecht|1982|p=268}}
But the audiences still came to see the girls, and burlesque remained profitable.{{sfn|Briggeman|2004|p=12}}

[[File:Columbia Theatre 1920 by Anthony F. Dumas.jpg|thumb|[[Columbia Theatre (New York City)|Columbia Theatre]] at Broadway &amp; 47th in 1920, "Home of Burlesque De Luxe"]]
The Star and Garter opened in Chicago in 1908, providing "Clean Entertainment for Self-Respecting People".{{sfn|Wagenknecht|1982|p=268}}
On 10 January 1910 the Columbia Amusement Company opened the [[Columbia Theatre (New York City)|Columbia Theatre]], "Home of Burlesque De Luxe", at Broadway and 47th Street in Manhattan. The theater was designed by [[William H. McElfatrick]] and had a capacity of 1,385. The company owned and operated it.{{sfn|Columbia Theatre, MCNY}}
The Columbia theater opening was well publicized and was attended by various dignitaries.{{sfn|Wagenknecht|1982|p=268}}

==Evolution==
[[File:Mutt and Jeff in Panama 1913.jpg|thumb|Song book cover for Gus Hill's ''Mutt and Jeff in Panama''. After "cartoon theatricals" like this finished their run in vaudeville they often moved to Hill's burlesque franchises.{{sfn|Winchester|1995|p=29}}]]
The Empire pushed the legal limits with its "hot" shows.
The Columbia often lowered its standards and competed directly with the Empire.{{sfn|Allen|1991|p=191-192}}
In 1913 the Eastern and Western wheels were consolidated into the Columbia Amusement Company, headed by Samuel Scribner and [[Isidore Herk]]. The combined operation put on fairly clean shows, as had the Eastern Wheel.{{sfn|Allen|1991|p=249}}
The Columbia Wheel now had two large burlesque circuits.{{sfn|New Burlesque Circuit, NYT 1915}}
Another wheel started to compete with raunchier performances.{{sfn|Allen|1991|p=249}}
In May 1915 the company transferred its No. 2 circuit, which had forty theaters and thirty-four touring companies, to a new subsidiary corporation called the American Burlesque Association. Gus Hill was named president of the new entity.{{sfn|New Burlesque Circuit, NYT 1915}}
The American Wheel offered rawer performances, with blue humor and suggestive dancing, and drove the competition out of business.{{sfn|Allen|1991|p=249}}

In 1921 Scribner insisted that shows in the Columbia circuit include their own orchestras so they resembled the more respectable vaudeville shows, and banned smoking in the theaters. He also tried to ban the comedians from using double entendres, but with less success.{{sfn|Shteir|2004|p=72}}
A 1922 report said "the companies will come to town on the same day each week to offer what is declared to be comedies with music, musical shows with chorus girls or whatever may best describe clean, wholesome offerings that should not be confused with "burlesque" as it was presented when Dad was a young chap."{{sfn|Columbia Wheel Shows, Reading Eagle 1922}}

The Columbia Wheel avoided runways until its final years, although the subsidiary American Wheel offered cooch dancers performing on runways.{{sfn|Briggeman|2004|p=14}}
In 1922 the American Wheel was dissolved due to an argument between Scribner and Herk and replaced by the Mutual Wheel.{{sfn|Allen|1991|p=249}}
Herk headed up the Mutual.{{sfn|Shteir|2004|p=72}}
Performers for the Mutual Wheel became the first to expose their breasts.
The Mutual put on less elaborate shows with more tease, although it generally did not include stripping.{{sfn|Briggeman|2004|p=15}}
The Mutual grew fast, buying up Columbia theaters across the country.{{sfn|Shteir|2004|p=73}}

==Decline and dissolution==

In 1923 Columbia still had thirty-eight shows, and was still the largest burlesque operation in the country.
However, receipts were declining.{{sfn|Allen|1991|p=249}}
By the mid-1920s cinemas were providing shows that combined film and live entertainment with ticket prices lower than any burlesque show.{{sfn|Allen|1991|p=244}}
In the 1925 season Scribner authorized the removal of tights, and tableaux of bare-breasted women. Columbia continued to lose customers to other types of entertainment and to more explicit stock burlesque theaters.{{sfn|Allen|1991|p=249}}

Columbia and Mutual merged in 1927 to form the United Burlesque Association.{{sfn|Briggeman|2004|p=15}} Herk, President of the Mutual Wheel, became President of the new combination, with Scribner, formerly president of the Columbia Wheel, as the Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref name=BCE1928-01-15&gt;Buffalo Currier Express, January 15, 1928&lt;/ref&gt; The new organization comprised 44 theaters,&lt;ref name=BCE1928-01-15/&gt; and soon reverted to the name Mutual Burlesque Circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Brooklyn Standard Union August 2, 1929, pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philadelphia Inquirer May 19, 1929, pg 12&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1927–28 season the combined circuit was struggling financially. This was the last season where cartoon theatricals were a significant part of the burlesque shows.{{sfn|Winchester|1995|p=30}} In 1930–31 the combined wheel decided to revive clean burlesque. The experiment failed and the circuit closed.{{sfn|Allen|1991|p=249}}

{{God |representations}}

A '''creator deity''' or '''creator god''' (often called '''the Creator''') is a [[deity]] or [[god]] responsible for the creation of the [[Earth]], [[World (theology)|world]], and [[universe]] in human mythology. In [[monotheism]], the single [[God]] is often also the creator. A number of [[Monolatrism|monolatristic]] traditions separate a secondary creator from a primary [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] being, identified as a primary creator.&lt;ref name="Hindus"&gt;(2004) Sacred Books of the Hindus Volume 22 Part 2: Pt. 2, p. 67, R.B. Vidyarnava, Rai Bahadur Srisa Chandra Vidyarnava&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monotheism==
[[Zoroastrianism]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Atenism]] teach that creation is the origin of the universe by the action of [[God]].

===Atenism===
{{See also|Atenism}}
Initiated by Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] and [[Nefertiti|Queen Nefertiti]] around 1330 BCE, during New Kingdom period in ancient Egyptian history. They built an entirely new capital city ([[Akhetaten]]) for themselves and worshippers of their Sole Creator God on a wilderness. His father used to worship [[Aten]] alongside other gods of their polytheistic religion. Aten, for a longtime before his father's time, was revered as a god among the many gods and goddesses in Egypt. Atenism faded away after death of the pharaoh. Despite different views, Atenism is considered by some scholars to be one of the frontiers of monotheism in human history.

===Judaism===
{{Further|Genesis creation narrative}}
The creation narrative is made up of two stories, roughly equivalent to the two first chapters of the [[Book of Genesis]].{{sfn|Alter|1981|p=141}} (There are no chapter divisions in the original Hebrew text, see [[Chapters and verses of the Bible]].) The first account (1:1 through 2:3) employs a repetitious structure of divine fiat and fulfillment, then the statement "And there was evening and there was morning, the [''x''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;] day," for each of the six days of creation. In each of the first three days there is an act of division: day one divides the darkness from light, day two the "waters above" from the "waters below", and day three the sea from the land. In each of the next three days these divisions are populated: day four populates the darkness and light with sun, moon and stars; day five populates seas and skies with fish and fowl; and finally land-based creatures and mankind populate the land.{{sfn|Ruiten|2000|pp=9-10}}

The two stories are complementary rather than overlapping, with the first (the [[Priestly source|Priestly story]]) concerned with the cosmic plan of creation, while the second (the [[Jahwist|Yahwist story]]) focuses on man as cultivator of his environment and as a moral agent.{{sfn|Alter|1981|p=141}} There are significant parallels between the two stories, but also significant differences: the second account, in contrast to the regimented seven-day scheme of Genesis 1, uses a simple flowing narrative style that proceeds from God's forming the first man through the [[Garden of Eden]] to the creation of the first woman and the institution of marriage; in contrast to the omnipotent God of Genesis 1, creating a god-like humanity, the God of Genesis 2 can fail as well as succeed; the humanity he creates is not god-like, but is punished for acts which would lead to their becoming god-like (Genesis 3:1-24); and the order and method of creation itself differs.{{sfn|Carr|1996|p=62-64}} "Together, this combination of parallel character and contrasting profile point to the different origin of materials in Genesis 1:1 and Gen 2:4, however elegantly they have now been combined."{{sfn|Carr|1996|p=64}}

===Christianity===
{{See also|Ex nihilo|Book of Genesis|Logos (Christianity)}}
[[Ancient Near Eastern mythologies]] and classical creation myths in [[Greek mythology]] envisioned the creation of the world as resulting from the actions of a god or gods upon already-existing primeval matter, known as ''[[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]''.

An early conflation of Greek philosophy with the [[Genesis creation narrative|narratives]] in the Hebrew Bible came from [[Philo of Alexandria]] (d. AD 50), writing in the context of [[Hellenistic Judaism]]. Philo equated the Hebrew creator-deity [[Yahweh]] with [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[primum movens]]'' (First Cause)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Yonge, Charles Duke (1854) |title=Appendices A Treatise Concerning the World (1): But what can be worse than this, or more calculated to display the want of true nobility existing in the soul, than the notion of causes in general being secondary and created causes, combined with an ignorance of the one first cause, the uncreated God, the Creator of the universe, who for these and innumerable other reasons is most excellent, reasons which because of their magnitude human intellect is unable to apprehend?"

Plato Laws Book X, Public Domain-Project Gutenberg. “ATHENIAN: Then I suppose that I must repeat the singular argument of those who manufacture the soul according to their own impious notions; they affirm that which is the first cause of the generation and destruction of all things, to be not first, but last, and that which is last to be first, and hence they have fallen into error about the true nature of the Gods… Then we must say that self-motion being the origin of all motions, and the first which arises among things at rest as well as among things in motion, is the eldest and mightiest principle of change, and that which is changed by another and yet moves other is second.”&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} to prove that the Jews had held [[monotheistic]] views even before the Greeks.  However, this was still within the context of creation from pre-existing materials (i.e. "moving" or "changing" a material substratum.)

A similar theoretical proposition was demonstrated by Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Doctor of the Church]] and founder of the [[Thomism]] that linked the Aristotelian philosophy with the Christian faith, followed by the statement for which God is the First Being, the Fist Moving unmoved, and is Pure Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | translator1= Fathers of the English Dominican Province | url = https://dhspriory.org/thomas/summa/FP/FP003.html | title = On the simplicity of God, in " Summa Theologiae", Part I, Question  3. | publisher = Benziger Bros. edition | year =  1947 | website = Priory of Domenican Order | access-date = Oct 6, 2018 | quotation = Ostensum est autem supra quod Deus est primum movens immobile.

Looking at the Bible, the [[Second Book of Maccabees]] shows two relevant passages. At chapter 7, it narrows about the mother of a [[Martyr#Judaism|Jewish proto-martyr]] telling to her son: "I beseech thee, my son, look upon heaven and earth, and all that is in them: '''and consider that God made them out of nothing''', and mankind also"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Maccabees-Chapter-7_Original-1611-KJV/ | title = 1611 King James Bible.

Christianity affirms the Creation by God since its early time in the [[Apostles' Creed#Text in Latin|Apostles'Creed]] ("I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.", 1st century BC), that is symmetrical to the [[Nicene Creed#History#Comparison between creed of 325 and creed of 381|Nicene Creed]] (4th century BC).

Nowadays, theologians debate whether the Bible itself teaches if this creation by God is a creation ''ex nihilo''. Traditional interpreters&lt;ref&gt;

argue on grammatical and syntactical grounds that this is the meaning of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:1, which is commonly rendered: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." They further find support for this view in New Testament passages like [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 11:3—"By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible"—and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 4:11—"For you [God] created all things, and by your will they existed and were created."

understand creation ''ex nihilo'' as a 2nd-century theological development. According to this view, church fathers opposed notions appearing in ''pre''-Christian [[creation myth]]s and in [[Gnosticism]]—notions of creation by a [[demiurge]] out of a primordial state of matter (known in religious studies as ''[[chaos (mythology)|chaos]]'' after the Greek term used by [[Hesiod]] in his ''[[Theogony]]'').&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = Probably the idea of creation never entered the human mind apart from Revelation. Though some of the pagan philosophers attained to a relatively high conception of God as the supreme ruler of the world, they seem never to have drawn the next logical inference of His being the absolute cause of all finite existence. [...] The descendants of Sem and Abraham, of Isaac and Jacob, preserved the idea of creation clear and pure; and from the opening verse of Genesis to the closing book of the Old Testament the doctrine of creation runs unmistakably outlined and absolutely undefiled by any extraneous element. "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." In this, the first, sentence of the Bible we see the fountain-head of the stream which is carried over to the new order by the declaration of the mother of the Machabees: "Son, look upon heaven and earth, and all that is in them: and consider that God made them out of nothing" (2 Maccabees 7:28). One has only to compare the Mosaic account of the creative work with that recently discovered on the clay tablets unearthed from the ruins of Babylon to discern the immense difference between the unadulterated revealed tradition and the puerile story of the cosmogony corrupted by polytheistic myths. Between the Hebrew and the Chaldean account there is just sufficient similarity to warrant the supposition that both are versions of some antecedent record or tradition; but no one can avoid the conviction that the Biblical account represents the pure, even if incomplete, truth, while the Babylonian story is both legendary and fragmentary (Smith, "Chaldean Account of Genesis", New York, 1875).

&lt;/ref&gt; which became important to Judaism.

===Islam===
{{Main|Islamic views on evolution}}
According to [[Islam]], God, known in Arabic as [[Allah]], is the all-powerful and all-knowing Creator, Sustainer, Ordainer, and Judge of the universe. Islam puts a heavy emphasis on the conceptualization of God as strictly singular ([[tawhid]]). God is unique (''wahid'') and inherently one (''ahad''), all-merciful and omnipotent. According to tradition there are [[99 Names of God]] (al-asma al-husna lit. meaning: "The best names") each of which evoke a distinct attribute of God. All these names refer to [[Allah]], the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name. Among the 99 names of God, the most famous and most frequent of these names are "the Compassionate" (''al-rahman'') and "the Merciful" (''al-rahim'').

Creation is seen as an act of divine choice and mercy, one with a grand purpose: "And We ([[Royal we]]) did not create the heaven and earth and that between them in play."&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an [21:16], Sahih International Translation&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the purpose of humanity is to be tested: "Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving;"&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an [67:2], Muhsin Khan Translation&lt;/ref&gt; Those who pass the test are rewarded with Paradise: "Verily for the Righteous there will be a fulfilment of (the heart's) desires;"&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an [78:31], Yusuf Ali Translation&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Islamic teachings, God exists above the heavens and the creation itself. The Qur'an mentions, "He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He Istawa (rose over) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything."&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an [2:29], Muhsin Khan Translation&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, God is unlike anything in creation: "There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing."&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an [42:11], Sahih International Translation&lt;/ref&gt; and nobody can perceive God in totality: "Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives [all] vision; and He is the Subtle, the Acquainted."&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an [6:103], Sahih International Translation&lt;/ref&gt; God in Islam is not only majestic and sovereign, but also a personal God: "And indeed We have created man, and We know what his ownself whispers to him. And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein (by Our Knowledge)."&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an [50:16], Muhsin Khan Translation&lt;/ref&gt; Allah commands the believers to constantly remember Him ("O you who have believed, remember Allah with much remembrance"&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an [33:41], Sahih International Translation&lt;/ref&gt;) and to invoke Him alone ("And whoever invokes besides Allah another deity for which he has no proof - then his account is only with his Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will not succeed."&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an [23:117], Sahih International Translation&lt;/ref&gt;).

Islam teaches that God as referenced in the [[Qur'an]] is the only god and the same God worshipped by members of other [[Abrahamic religion]]s such as Christianity and Judaism.

===Sikhism===
{{Main|Sikh beliefs}}
One of the biggest responsibilities in the faith of [[Sikhism]] is to worship God as "The Creator", termed ''[[Waheguru]]'' who is shapeless, timeless, and sightless, i.e., [[Nirankar]], [[Akal]], and [[Alakh Niranjan]]. The religion only takes after the belief in "One God for All" or [[Ik Onkar]].

===Bahá'í===
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]] God is the imperishable, uncreated being who is the source of all existence.&lt;ref name="BFaith-74"&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|1985|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is described as "a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipresence|omnipresent]] and [[omnipotence|almighty]]".&lt;ref name="Psmith106"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Effendi|1944|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and inaccessible directly, his image is reflected in his creation.  The purpose of creation is for the created to have the capacity to know and love its creator.&lt;ref name="Psmith111"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monolatrism==
{{See also|Brahma}}
[[Monolatrism|Monolatristic]] traditions would separate a secondary creator from the primary [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] being, identified as a primary creator.&lt;ref name="Hindus" /&gt; According to [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]]s, [[Brahma]] is the secondary creator and not the supreme.&lt;ref&gt;Nandalal Sinha {1934} The Vedânta-sûtras of Bâdarâyaṇa, with the Commentary of Baladeva. p. 413&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vishnu]] is the primary creator. According to [[Vaishnava]] belief Vishnu creates the basic universal shell and provides all the raw materials and also places the living entities within the material world, fulfilling their own independent will. Brahma works with the materials provided by Vishnu to actually create what are believed to be planets in Puranic terminology, and he supervises the population of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krishna.com/en/node/449 |title=Secondary Creation |publisher=Krishna.com |accessdate=2009-08-06 |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126165402/http://www.krishna.com/en/node/449 |archivedate=26 November 2009 }}

==Monism==
{{Main|Monism}}
Monism is the philosophy that asserts oneness as its fundamental premise, and it contradicts the dualism-based theistic premise that there is a creator God that is eternal and separate from the rest of existence. There are two types of monism, namely spiritual monism which holds that all spiritual reality is one, and material monism which holds that everything including all material reality is one and the same thing.&lt;ref name="Anderson2015monism"&gt;{{cite book|author=Owen Anderson|title=The Declaration of Independence and God: Self-Evident Truths in American Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CW2gCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT234| year=2015| publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-40464-5|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===

===Jainism===
{{Main|Jainism and non-creationism}}
[[Jainism]] does not support belief in a creator deity. According to Jain doctrine, the [[universe]] and its constituents - soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion have always existed (a [[static universe]] similar to that of [[Epicureanism]] and [[Steady State theory|steady state cosmological model]]). All the constituents and actions are governed by [[Universal Law|universal]] [[natural laws]]. It is not possible to create matter out of nothing and hence the sum total of matter in the universe remains the same (similar to law of [[conservation of mass]]). Similarly, the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] of each living being is unique and uncreated and has existed since beginningless time.{{Ref label|A|a|none}}&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar (2005b), p.190, Gāthā 10.310&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain theory of [[Causality|causation]] holds that a cause and its effect are always identical in nature and therefore a conscious and immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Furthermore, according to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its karmas and desires, achieves liberation. A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the [[cosmos]]; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.

Through the ages, [[Jain Philosophy#Jain philosophers|Jain philosophers]] have adamantly rejected and opposed the concept of creator and omnipotent God and this has resulted in Jainism being labeled as ''[[Āstika and nāstika|nāstika darsana]]'' or [[Atheism|atheist philosophy]] by the rival [[Indian philosophy|religious philosophies]]. The theme of non-creationism and absence of omnipotent God and divine grace runs strongly in all the philosophical dimensions of Jainism, including its [[Jain cosmology|cosmology]], [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]] and its moral code of conduct. Jainism asserts a religious and virtuous life is possible without the idea of a creator god.&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite journal | last =Soni | first =Jayandra | editor =E.

==Polytheism==
In polytheistic creation, the world often comes into being organically, e.g. sprouting from a primal seed, sexually, by [[miraculous birth]] (sometimes by [[parthenogenesis]]), by [[hieros gamos]], violently, by the slaying of a [[Chaos (cosmogony)|primeval monster]], or artificially, by a divine [[demiurge]] or "craftsman". Sometimes, a god is involved, wittingly or unwittingly, in bringing about creation. Examples include:

** In Hinduism, its Vedic scriptures call the unchanging eternal reality as [[Brahman]]. The [[Nasadiya Sukta]] of the [[Rig Veda]] expresses doubt whether there is or is not any creator deity, and whether even gods know who or what created the universe.  In later [[Puranas|Puranic]] period, equate the [[Brahman]] to [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]] or [[Devi]], and each major sub-tradition of Hinduism calls them respectively as the creator deity.

===Platonic demiurge===
{{Main|Demiurge}}
{{Further|Neoplatonism and Gnosticism|Great Architect of the Universe}}
[[Plato]], in his dialogue [[Timaeus (dialogue)| ''Timaeus'']], describes a creation myth involving a being called the [[demiurge]] ({{lang|grc|δημιουργός}} "craftsman"). [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Gnosticism]] continued and developed this concept. In Neoplatonism, the demiurge represents the second cause or [[dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]], after the [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|monad]]. In Gnostic [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], the demiurge is an imperfect spirit and possibly an evil being, transcended by divine Fullness ([[Pleroma]]). Unlike the Abrahamic God, Plato's demiurge is unable to create [[ex-nihilo]].

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Hindu views on evolution}}
Hinduism is a diverse system of thought with beliefs spanning [[monotheism]], [[polytheism]], [[panentheism]], [[Hindu views on Pantheism|pantheism]], [[pandeism]], [[monism]], and [[Atheism in Hinduism|atheism]] among others;&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius J. Lipner]] (2010), Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-45677-7}}, page 8; Quote: "(...) one need not be religious in the minimal sense described to be accepted as a Hindu by Hindus, or describe oneself perfectly validly as Hindu.

Hinduism is sometimes referred to as [[henotheistic]] (i.e., involving devotion to a single god while accepting the existence of others), but any such term is an overgeneralization.&lt;ref name=heno&gt;See {{harvnb|Michaels|2004|p=xiv}} and {{cite web |url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/egyptmyth/g/henotheism.htm |title=Henotheism |accessdate=5 July 2007 |last=Gill |first=N.S |publisher=[[About.com|About, Inc]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317151629/http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/egyptmyth/g/henotheism.htm |archivedate=17 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Nasadiya Sukta]]'' (''Creation Hymn'') of the ''[[Rig Veda]]'' is one of the earliest texts{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=226}} which "demonstrates a sense of metaphysical speculation" about what created the universe, the concept of god(s) and The One, and whether even The One knows how the universe came into being.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=226}}; {{harvnb|Kramer|1986|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=3translations&gt;

The "One Truth" of Vedic literature, in modern era scholarship, has been interpreted as monotheism, monism, as well as a deified Hidden Principles behind the great happenings and processes of nature.&lt;ref&gt;'''HN Raghavendrachar''' (1944), [http://eprints.uni-mysore.ac.in/15675/1/12MONISMINTHEVEDAS.pdf Monism in the Vedas], The half-yearly journal of the Mysore University: Section A - Arts, Volume 4, Issue 2, pages 137-152;&lt;br /&gt;'''K Werner''' (1982), Men, gods and powers in the Vedic outlook, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland, Volume 114, Issue 01, pages 14-24;&lt;br /&gt;'''H Coward''' (1995), Book Review:" The Limits of Scripture: Vivekananda's Reinterpretation of the Vedas", Journal of Hindu-Christian Studies, Volume 8, Issue 1, pages 45-47, '''Quote''': "There is little doubt that the theo-monistic category is an appropriate one for viewing a wide variety of experiences in the Hindu tradition".&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Vedic texts of Hinduism offer multiple theories of [[cosmogony]], many involving [[Brahma]]. These include ''Sarga'' (primary creation of universe) and ''Visarga'' (secondary creation), ideas related to the Indian thought that there are two levels of reality, one primary that is unchanging ([[metaphysics|metaphysical]]) and other secondary that is always changing ([[empiricism|empirical]]), and that all observed reality of the latter is in an endless repeating cycle of existence, that cosmos and life we experience is continually created, evolved, dissolved and then re-created.&lt;ref name=tpinchman125&gt;Tracy Pintchman (1994), The Rise of the Goddess in the Hindu Tradition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791421123}}, pages 122-138&lt;/ref&gt; The primary creator is extensively discussed in Vedic cosmogonies with ''Brahman'' or ''[[Purusha]]'' or ''[[Devi]]'' among the terms used for the primary creator,&lt;ref name=tpinchman125/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Gonda (1969), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40457085 The Hindu Trinity], Anthropos, Bd 63/64, H 1/2, pages 213-214&lt;/ref&gt; while the Vedic and post-Vedic texts name different gods and goddesses as secondary creators (often Brahma in post-Vedic texts), and in some cases a different god or goddess is the secondary creator at the start of each cosmic cycle (''kalpa'', aeon).&lt;ref name="Stella Kramrisch 1994 pages 205-206"&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1994), The Presence of Siva, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691019307}}, pages 205-206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tpinchman125/&gt;

Brahma is a "secondary creator" as described in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and [[Puranas]], and among the most studied and described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryant|first1=ed. by Edwin F.|title=Krishna : a sourcebook|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-514891-6|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sutton|first1=Nicholas|title=Religious doctrines in the Mahābhārata|date=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|location=Delhi|isbn=81-208-1700-1|pages=182|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asian Mythologies by Yves Bonnefoy &amp; Wendy Doniger.

In other versions of creation, the creator deity is the one who is equivalent to the [[Brahman]], the metaphysical reality in Hinduism. In [[Vaishnavism]], Vishnu creates Brahma and orders him to order the rest of universe. In [[Shaivism]], Shiva may be treated as the creator. In [[Shaktism]], the [[Mahadevi|Great Goddess]] creates the Trimurti.&lt;ref name="Stella Kramrisch 1994 pages 205-206"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tpinchman125/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=64-65 |author=Arvind Sharma|title=Classical Hindu Thought: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gDmUToaeMJ0C |year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-564441-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==

===Chinese traditional cosmology===
[[Pangu]] can be interpreted as another creator deity. In the beginning there was nothing in the [[universe]] except a formless [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]. However this chaos began to coalesce into a [[world egg|cosmic egg]] for eighteen thousand years. Within it, the perfectly opposed principles of [[yin and yang]] became balanced and Pangu emerged (or woke up) from the egg. Pangu is usually depicted as a primitive, hairy [[giant (mythology)|giant]] with horns on his head (like the Greek [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]) and clad in furs. Pangu set about the task of creating the world: he separated Yin from Yang with a swing of his giant axe, creating the [[Earth]] (murky ''Yin'') and the [[Sky]] (clear ''Yang''). To keep them separated, Pangu stood between them and pushed up the Sky. This task took eighteen thousand years, with each day the sky grew ten feet higher, the Earth ten feet wider, and Pangu ten feet taller. In some versions of the story, Pangu is aided in this task by the four most prominent beasts, namely the [[Turtle]], the [[Qilin]], the [[Chinese phoenix|Phoenix]], and the [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]].

After eighteen thousand years&lt;ref&gt;(Note: In ancient China, 18,000 does not exactly mean eighteen thousand, it is meant to be "many", or "a number that could not be counted").&lt;/ref&gt; had elapsed, Pangu was laid to rest. His breath became the [[wind]]; his voice the [[thunder]]; left eye the [[sun]] and right eye the [[moon]]; his body became the [[mountain]]s and extremes of the world; his blood formed rivers; his muscles the fertile lands; his facial hair the stars and milky way; his fur the bushes and forests; his bones the valuable minerals; his bone marrows sacred diamonds; his sweat fell as rain; and the fleas on his fur carried by the wind became [[human being]]s all over the world.

The first writer to record the myth of Pangu was [[Xu Zheng (Eastern Wu)|Xu Zheng]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.

[[Shangdi]] is another creator deity, possibly prior to Pangu; sharing concepts similar to Abrahamic faiths.

===Kazakh===
According to [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] folk tales, Jasagnan is the creator of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinesefolklore.org.cn/blog/?uid-2072-action-viewspace-itemid-10038 人类起源神话：西北地区民族（04）：哈萨克族2-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15189">'''Democratic globalisation''' is a [[social movement]] towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]].  This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate [[oligopolies]], ideological [[Non-governmental organisation|NGO]]s, cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the [[United Kingdom|British]] political thinker [[David Held]].  In the last decade he published a dozen books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of [[global governance]] that encapsulates the entire world. For some, '''democratic [[mundialisation]]''' is a variant of democratic globalisation stressing the need for the direct election of world leaders and members of global institutions by citizens worldwide; for others, it is just another name for democratic globalisation.

These proponents state that democratic globalisation's purpose is to:
* Expand [[globalisation]] and make people closer and more united. This expansion should differ from economic globalization and "make people closer, more united and protected"; because of a variety of opinions and proposals it is still unclear what this would mean in practice and how it could be realized.
* Have it reach all fields of activity and knowledge, including governmental and economic, since the economic one is crucial to develop the well-being of world citizens; and
* Give [[world citizen]]s democratic access and a say in those global activities. For example, presidential voting for [[United Nations Secretary-General]] by citizens and [[direct election]] of members of a [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]].

Supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the '[[anti-globalization]]' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters.  Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions.
Some proponents in the "anti-globalization movement" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, [[George Monbiot]], normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term [[Global Justice Movement]]) in his work ''Age of Consent'' has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies, and suggests a form of "world government."

== Background ==
Democratic globalization supports the extension of political democratization to economic and [[Global financial system|financial globalization]]. It is based upon an idea that free international transactions benefit the global society as a whole. They believe in financially
open economies, where the government and [[central bank]] must be transparent in order to retain the confidence of the markets, since transparency spells doom for [[autocratic regime]]s. They promote democracy that makes leaders more accountable to the citizenry through the removal of restrictions on such transactions.

== Social movements ==
The democratic globalization movement started to get public attention when New York Times reported its demonstration to contest a [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in Seattle, Washington, November 1999. This gathering was to criticize unfair trade and undemocratic globalization of the WTO, [[World Bank]], [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF), the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Its primary tactics were public rallies, street theater and [[civil disobedience]].

Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic global institutions and changing [[international organization]]s (which are currently [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by world citizens.  The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged democratic world government.

===Global democracy===
Thus, it supports the [[International Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, direct election of United Nations (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide.

==Difference to anti-globalization==
Some supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the '[[anti-globalization]]' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters although, in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two camps.  Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions and direct vote for world presidents (see [[presidentialism]]).

Some supporters of the "[[anti-globalization movement]]" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, [[George Monbiot]], normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term [[Global Justice Movement]]) in his work ''Age of Consent'' has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies by citizens, and suggests a form of "[[federal world government]]".

==Procedure==
Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic [[global institution]]s and changing international organizations (which are currently intergovernmental institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by voting by the citizens.  The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged [[democratic world government]].

They propose the creation of world services for citizens, like world [[civil protection]] and [[hazard prevention|prevention]] (from [[natural hazard]]s) services.

==Proponents==
The concept of democratic globalization has supporters from all fields. Many of the campaigns and initiatives for global democracy, such as the UNPA campaign, list quotes by and names of their supporters on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;
UNPA Campaign "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/quotes/index.php Quotes]" and "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/appeal/support/ini_all_0.php list of featured supporters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903154706/http://en.unpacampaign.org/appeal/support/ini_all_0.php |date=2010-09-03 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academics===
Some of the most prolific proponents are the [[United Kingdom|British]] political thinker [[David Held]] and the Italian political theorist [[Daniele Archibugi]].  In the last decade they published several books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of [[global governance]] that encapsulates the entire planet. [[Richard Falk]] has developed the idea from an international law perspective, [[Ulrich Beck]] from a sociological approach and [[Jürgen Habermas]] has elaborate the normative principles.

===Politicians===
*In 2003 Bob Brown, the leader of the Australian Green Party, has tabled a move for global democracy in the Australian Senate: "I move: That the Senate supports global democracy based on the principle of `one person, one vote, one value'; and supports the vision of a global parliament which empowers all the world's people equally to decide on matters of international significance."&lt;ref&gt;
The Senate of Australia "[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F2003-06-16%2F0073%22 GLOBAL DEMOCRACY AND GLOBAL PARLIAMENT]".&lt;/ref&gt;
*The current President of Bolivia [[Evo Morales]] and the Bolivian UN Ambassador [[Pablo Solón Romero]] have demanded a democratisation of the UN on many occasions. For example, Evo Morales at the United Nations, May 7, 2010: “The response to global warming is global democracy for life and for the Mother Earth.. … we have two paths: to save capitalism, or to save life and Mother Earth.”&lt;ref&gt;
Evo Morales "[http://climateandcapitalism.com/2010/05/11/2438/ United, the developing countries can save the world]".&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Graham Watson]] (Former member of the European Parliament and former leader of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]]) and [[Jo Leinen]] (Member of the European Parliament) are strong supporter of global democracy. They were among those presenting the “Brussels Declaration on Global Democracy” on February 23, 2010, at an event inside the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;
KDUN "[http://www.kdun.org/782/brussels-declaration-on-global-democracy/ Brussels Declaration on Global Democracy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606082234/http://www.kdun.org/782/brussels-declaration-on-global-democracy/ |date=2010-06-06 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;
*The appeals of the campaign for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly has already been endorsed by more than 700 parliamentarians from more than 90 countries.&lt;ref&gt;
UNPA Campaign "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/support/index.php Overview support]".&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Garry Davis]] (Peace activist who created the first "World Passport)
:[[Albert Einstein]] ("The moral authority of the UN would be considerable enhanced if the delegates were elected directly by the people.")
:[[George Monbiot]] ("A world parliament allows the poor to speak for themselves")&lt;ref&gt;

===Grassroot movements===
Jim Stark has initiated a process for a Democratic World Parliament through a Global Referendum.  As of August 20, 2013, 22,126 people have voted. So far, the votes are 95.3% in favor of creating a democratic world parliament. Portable voting booths are available at http://voteworldparliament.org/shadowbox/getballot.html. Online voting at Mr. Stark's website is at voteworldparliament.org. Mr. Stark has published a companion book to the online referendum entitled "Rescue Plan for Planet Earth".

[[File:HawawishRockTombs.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rock tombs at El Hawawish]]
'''El Hawawish''' ({{lang-ar|الحواويش}}) is the name given to the site of the ancient [[necropolis]] (cemetery) for the city of [[Akhmim]] in the [[Sohag Governorate]], [[Egypt]].

The cemetery was excavated extensively by an [[Australia]]n archaeological and epigraphic expedition under the auspices of the [[Australian Centre for Egyptology]] and [[Macquarie University]] and the direction of Professor [[Naguib Kanawati]].

'''Geόrgii Chόrnyi''' ('''{{lang-uk|Чорний Георгій Петрович}}'''; born 	September 14, 1937 in [[Ukraine]]) is a Ukrainian [[scientist|aeronautical engineer]] who was awarded a State Prize of Ukraine in Science and Technology in 2018. He  has also written a history of early Ukraine, and received the Mykhailo Chabanivskyi Ukrainian literary Prize in 2015.

== Early life ==
Geόrgii Chόrnyi (''[[:uk:Чорний Георгій Петрович]]'') was born in a peasant family on September 14, 1937 in the Dubόvi Hriády village, on territory of the former Orilian palanka (''[[:uk:Орільська паланка]]'') -  one of 10 regions of the Сossack State of Zaporizhzhya. Evidently, his nearest ancestors were [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], among which the last name Chόrnyi was most common.&lt;ref&gt;''Aрхів Коша Нової Запорізької Січі. Корпус документів. 1734 -1775.

==Engineering and scientific activity==
Since 1965, he has worked at the State Kyiv design bureau "Luch" (''[[:uk:Луч (конструкторське бюро)]]),'' and has written a book about it.&lt;ref&gt;Чорний, Георгій (2011). ''Нариси з історії конструкторського бюро'' [Chornyi, Georgii (2011).

At the same time, he was associate professor in the [[National Aviation University]] (2002-2012), and published  a textbook ''Автоматизовані системи контролю літальних апаратів'', &lt;ref&gt;Чорний, Георгій (2008). ''Автоматизовані системи контролю літальних апаратів'' [Chornyi, Georgii. Automatic systems for avionics testing], National Aviation University, Kyiv. - 160p. &lt;small&gt;(Ukrainian)&lt;/small&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt; with the recommendation of Department of Education and Science of Ukraine.  
== Literary and public activity ==
He has at the same time studied sources on the [[language]], [[genetics]], [[history]], and [[culture]] of [[Ukrainians]]. The results of his research on linguistic-historical themes were printed in newspapers: "[[Holos Ukrayiny]]",&lt;ref&gt;Чорний, Георгій. "Вулкан державної двомовності" [Chornii, Georgii.

Goa is visited by large numbers of international and domestic tourists each year for its white sand beaches, nightlife, places of worship and [[Old Goa|World Heritage-listed architecture]]. It has rich flora and fauna, owing to its location on the [[Western Ghats]] range, a [[biodiversity]] hotspot.

[[File:Kadamba.PNG|thumb|Gold coins issued by the Kadamba king of Goa, Shivachitta Paramadideva. ''Circa'' 1147–1187 AD.]]
Early Goan society underwent radical change when [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] and [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] migrants amalgamated with the aboriginal locals, forming the base of early Goan culture.&lt;ref name=dhume2&gt;{{cite book|last=Dhume|first=Anant Ramkrishna|title=The cultural history of Goa from 10000 BC – 1352 AD|year=1986|publisher=Ramesh Anant S.

In the 3rd century BC, Goa was part of the [[Maurya Empire]], ruled by the Buddhist emperor, [[Ashoka]] of [[Magadha]]. Buddhist monks laid the foundation of Buddhism in Goa. Between the 2nd century BC and the 6th century AD, Goa was ruled by the [[Bhojas of Goa]]. [[Chutu]]s of [[Karwar]] also ruled some parts as feudatories of the [[Satavahana]]s of [[Kolhapur]] (2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD), [[Western Kshatrapas]] (around 150 AD), the [[Abhira]]s of Western Maharashtra, Bhojas of the [[Yadav caste|Yadav]] clans of [[Gujarat]], and the Konkan Mauryas as feudatories of the [[Kalachuri]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|De Souza|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dwYDPnEjTb4C&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=bhojas+goa&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=bhojas%20goa&amp;f=false 9]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule later passed to the Chalukyas of [[Badami]], who controlled it between 578 and 753, and later the [[Rashtrakuta]]s of [[Malkhed]] from 753 to 963. From 765 to 1015, the Southern [[Silhara]]s of [[Konkan]] ruled Goa as the feudatories of the Chalukyas and the Rashtrakutas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|De Souza|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dwYDPnEjTb4C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=bhojas+goa&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=bhojas%20goa&amp;f=false 10]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few centuries, Goa was successively ruled by the [[Kadambas of Goa|Kadambas]] as the feudatories of the [[Western Chalukya Empire|Chalukyas of Kalyani]]. They patronised [[Jainism in Goa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|De Souza|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dwYDPnEjTb4C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=bhojas+goa&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=bhojas%20goa&amp;f=false 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1312, Goa came under the governance of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. The kingdom's grip on the region was weak, and by 1370 it was forced to surrender it to [[Harihara I]] of the [[Vijayanagara empire]]. The Vijayanagara monarchs held on to the territory until 1469, when it was appropriated by the [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmani sultans]] of [[Gulbarga]]. After that dynasty crumbled, the area fell into the hands of the [[Adil Shahi]]s of [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]], who established as their auxiliary capital the city known under the Portuguese as [[Velha Goa]] (or Old Goa).&lt;ref name=dobbie&gt;{{cite book|last=Dobbie|first=Aline|title=India: The Elephant's Blessing|year=2006|publisher=Melrose Press|pages=253 pages (see page 220)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mahadev Temple, Tambdi Surla (12th century).jpg|thumb|The Mahadeva Temple, attributed to the Kadamba period.]]
In 1510, the Portuguese defeated the ruling Bijapur sultan [[Yusuf Adil Shah]] with the help of a local ally, [[Timayya]]. They set up a permanent settlement in Velha Goa. This was the beginning of Portuguese rule in Goa that would last for four and a half centuries, until its [[Annexation of Goa|annexation in 1961]]. The [[Goa Inquisition]], a formal tribunal, was established in 1560, and was finally abolished in 1812.&lt;ref name="Priolkar1961"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anant Kakba Priolkar|title=The Goa Inquisition: Being a Quatercentenary Commemoration Study of the Inquisition in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=toz9yHz5XikC|year=1961|publisher=Bombay University Press|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843 the Portuguese moved the capital to [[Panaji]] from Velha Goa. By the mid-18th century, Portuguese Goa had expanded to most of the present-day state limits. Simultaneously the Portuguese lost other possessions in India until their borders stabilised and formed the [[Portuguese India|Estado da Índia Portuguesa]] or ''State of Portuguese India'', of which Goa was the largest territory.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

After [[Indian independence movement|India gained independence]] from the British in 1947, India requested that Portuguese territories on the Indian subcontinent be ceded to India. Portugal refused to negotiate on the sovereignty of its Indian enclaves. On 19 December 1961, the Indian Army invaded with [[1961 Indian annexation of Goa|Operation Vijay]] resulting in the annexation of Goa, and of [[Daman and Diu]] islands into the Indian union. Goa, along with Daman and Diu, was organised as a centrally administered [[union territory]] of India. On 30 May 1987, the union territory was split, and Goa was made India's twenty-fifth state, with Daman and Diu remaining a union territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=peOqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA454&amp;lpg=PA454&amp;dq=Goa+was+made+India's+twenty-fifth+state#v=onepage&amp;q=Goa%20was%20made%20India's%20twenty-fifth%20state&amp;f=false|title=Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures - Continental Europe and its Empires|last=Poddar|first=Prem|date=2008-07-02|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748630271|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography and climate==

=== Geography ===
[[File:Donna Paula, Goa.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Goa coastline at [[Dona Paula]]]]
Goa encompasses an area of {{convert|3702|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It lies between the latitudes 14°53′54″ N and 15°40′00″ N and longitudes 73°40′33″ E and 74°20′13″ E.

Goa is a part of the coastal country known as the [[Konkan]], which is an escarpment rising up to the Western Ghats range of mountains, which separate it from the [[Deccan Plateau]]. The highest point is the [[Sonsogor]], with an altitude of {{convert|1167|m|ft}}. Goa has a coastline of {{convert|101|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

Goa's seven major rivers are the [[Zuari River|Zuari]], [[Mandovi River|Mandovi]], [[Terekhol River|Terekhol]], [[Chapora River|Chapora]], Galgibag, Kumbarjua canal, Talpona and the [[Sal River (India)|Sal]].&lt;ref name="Hiremath"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recent advances in environmental science|last=Hiremath|first=K. G.|publisher=Discovery Pub. House|year=2003|isbn=9788171416790|pages=401|oclc=56390521}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zuari and the Mandovi are the most important rivers, interspaced by the Kumbarjua canal, forming a major estuarine complex.&lt;ref name="Hiremath" /&gt; These rivers are fed by the Southwest monsoon rain and their basin covers 69% of the state's geographical area.&lt;ref name="Hiremath" /&gt; These rivers are some of the busiest in India. Goa has more than 40 estuarine, eight marine, and about 90 riverine islands. The total navigable length of Goa's rivers is {{convert|253|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Goa has more than 300 ancient water-tanks built during the rule of the Kadamba dynasty and over 100 medicinal springs.

The Mormugao harbour on the mouth of the [[River Zuari]] is one of the best natural harbours in South Asia.

Most of Goa's soil cover is made up of [[laterite]]s rich in ferric-aluminium oxides and reddish in colour. Further inland and along the riverbanks, the soil is mostly [[alluvial]] and [[loam]]y. The soil is rich in minerals and humus, thus conducive to agriculture. Some of the oldest rocks in the Indian subcontinent are found in Goa between [[Molem]] and [[Anmod]] on Goa's border with [[Karnataka]]. The rocks are classified as [[Gneiss|Trondjemeitic Gneiss]] estimated to be 3,600 million years old, dated by rubidium isotope dating. A specimen of the rock is exhibited at [[Goa University]].

=== Climate ===
[[File:Dudhsagar Falls Triplet.jpg|thumb|left|Dudhsagar Falls on the Goa-Karnataka border.]]
Goa features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Goa, being in the tropical zone and near the Arabian Sea, has a hot and humid climate for most of the year. The month of May is usually the hottest, seeing daytime temperatures of over {{convert|35|°C|°F|abbr=on}} coupled with high humidity. The state's three seasons are: Southwest monsoon period (June – September), post-monsoon period (October – January) and fair weather period (February – May).&lt;ref name="Hiremath" /&gt; Over 90% of the average annual rainfall (120 inches) is received during the monsoon season.&lt;ref name="Hiremath" /&gt;

{{Main|Districts of Goa}}
{{See also|List of cities and towns in Goa}}

The state is divided into two [[List of Indian districts|districts]]: [[North Goa]] and [[South Goa]]. Each district is administered by a district collector, appointed by the Indian government.

[[Panaji]] is the headquarters of North Goa district and is also the capital of Goa.

North Goa is further divided into three subdivisions&amp;nbsp;– Panaji, [[Mapusa]], and [[Bicholim]]; and five [[taluk]]s – [[Tiswadi|Ilhas de Goa (Tiswadi)]], [[Bardez]] ([[Mapusa]]), [[Pernem]], [[Bicholim]], and [[Sattari]] ([[Valpoi]]),

[[Margao|Margão]] is the headquarters of South Goa district.

South Goa is further divided into five subdivisions – [[Ponda, Goa|Ponda]], [[Mormugao]] ([[Vasco da Gama, Goa|Vasco da Gama]]), Margao, [[Quepem]], and [[Dharbandora]]; and seven ''taluks'' – [[Ponda taluk|Ponda]], [[Mormugao]], [[Salcete]] ([[Margao]]), [[Quepem]], and [[Canacona]] ([[Chaudi]]), [[Sanguem]], and [[Dharbandora]]. (Ponda Taluka shifted from North Goa to South Goa in January 2015).

Goa's major cities include [[Panaji]], [[Margao]], [[Vasco da Gama, Goa|Vasco da Gama]], [[Mapusa]], [[Ponda, Goa|Ponda]] and [[Valpoi]].

[[Panaji]] has the only Municipal Corporation in Goa.

There are thirteen Municipal Councils: Margao, Mormugao (including Vasco da Gama), Pernem, Mapusa, Bicholim, [[Sanquelim]], Valpoi, Ponda, [[Cuncolim]], Quepem, [[Curchorem]], Sanguem, and Canacona. Goa has a total number of 334 villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goadpse.gov.in/Goa%20Economy%20in%20Figures%202017.pdf|title=DIRECTORATE OF PLANNING, STATISTICS &amp; EVALUATION|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404073156/http://www.goadpse.gov.in/Goa%20Economy%20in%20Figures%202017.pdf#|archive-date=4 April 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Government of Goa}}
[[File:India Goa Assembly.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Goa Assembly]]
The politics of Goa are a result of the uniqueness of this region due to 450 years of Portuguese rule, in comparison to three centuries of British colonialism experienced by the rest of India. The [[Indian National Congress]] was unable to achieve electoral success in the first two decades after the State's incorporation into India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38918113|title=The construction of a political community : integration and identity in Goa|last=Rubinoff|first=Arthur G.,|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Sage Publications|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=18|oclc=38918113|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the state was dominated by the regional political parties like [[Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party]] and the [[United Goans Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38918113|title=The construction of a political community : integration and identity in Goa|last=Rubinoff|first=Arthur G.,|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Sage Publications|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=19|oclc=38918113|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Government&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;br&gt;
In the [[Parliament of India]], Goa has two seats in the Lok Sabha (House of the People), one representing each district, and one seat in the Rajya Sabha (Council of the States).

Goa's administrative capital is Panaji in English, Pangim in Portuguese, and Ponjê in the local language. It lies on the left bank of the Mandovi. The seat of the [[Goa Legislative Assembly]] is in [[Porvorim]], across the Mandovi from Panaji. As the state comes under the [[Bombay High Court]], Panaji has a bench of it. Unlike other states, which follow the British Indian model of civil laws framed for individual religions, the Portuguese [[Goa civil code|Goa Civil Code]], a uniform code based on the [[Napoleonic code]], has been retained in Goa.

Goa has a unicameral [[legislature]] of 40 members, headed by a speaker. The Chief Minister heads the executive, which is made up from the party or coalition elected with a majority in the legislature. The Governor, the head of the state, is appointed by the President of India. After having stable governance for nearly thirty years up to 1990, Goa is now notorious for its political instability having seen fourteen governments in the span of the fifteen years between 1990 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2005/01/31/stories/2005013104051100.htm Odds stacked against Parrikar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313090814/http://www.hindu.com/2005/01/31/stories/2005013104051100.htm# |date=13 March 2007 }}, Anil Sastry, ''[[The Hindu]]'', 31 January 2005, verified 2 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005 the assembly was dissolved by the Governor and [[President's Rule]] was declared, which suspended the legislature. A by-election in June 2005 saw the Indian National Congress coming back to power after winning three of the five seats that went to polls. The [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) are the two largest parties in the state. In the assembly poll of 2007, the INC-led coalition won and formed the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sanjay |last=Banerjee |title=Congress set to rule Goa again. |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2101667.cms |work=indiatimes.com |publisher=Times Internet Limited |date=6 June 2007 |accessdate=5 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114130238/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2101667.cms# |archive-date=14 January 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2012 Vidhan Sabha Elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party along with the [[Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party]] won a clear majority, forming the new government with Manohar Parrikar as the Chief Minister.

Government owned forest is estimated at {{convert|1224.38|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=on}} whilst private is given as {{convert|200|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=on}}. Most of the forests in the state are located in the interior eastern regions of the state. The [[Western Ghats]], which form most of eastern Goa, have been internationally recognised as one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. In the February 1999 issue of ''National Geographic Magazine'', Goa was compared with the Amazon and the Congo basins for its rich tropical biodiversity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Goa's wildlife sanctuaries boast of more than 1512 documented species of plants, over 275 species of birds, over 48 kinds of animals and over 60 genera of reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goahub.com/wildlife-sanctuaries-in-goa/index.html |title=Wildlife Sanctuaries in Goa |accessdate=18 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720010519/http://www.goahub.com/wildlife-sanctuaries-in-goa/index.html |archivedate=20 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goa is also known for its coconut cultivation. The coconut tree has been reclassified by the government as a palm (like a grass), enabling farmers and real estate developers to clear land with fewer restrictions.

Rice is the main food crop, and pulses (legume), ''Ragi'' (Finger Millet) and other food crops are also grown. Main cash crops are coconut, cashewnut, arecanut, sugarcane and fruits like pineapple, mango and banana.&lt;ref name="nic1" /&gt; Goa's state animal is the [[Gaur]], the state bird is the Ruby Throated Yellow Bulbul, which is a variation of [[Black-crested Bulbul]], and the state tree is the [[Terminalia tomentosa|Matti(Asna)]].

The important forests products are bamboo canes, [[Maratha]] barks, chillar barks and the [[bhirand]]. Coconut trees are ubiquitous and are present in almost all areas of Goa barring the elevated regions. A large number of [[deciduous]] trees, such as teak, Sal tree, cashew and mango trees are present. Fruits include jackfruit, mango, pineapple and "black-berry" ("podkoam" in Konkani language). Goa's forests are rich with medicinal plants.[[File:Goa Fields.JPG|thumb|left|[[Paddy field|Rice paddies]] are common in rural Goa.]]Foxes, wild boar and migratory birds are found in the jungles of Goa. The avifauna (bird species) includes kingfisher, ''myna'' and parrot. Numerous types of fish are also caught off the coast of Goa and in its rivers. Crab, lobster, shrimp, jellyfish, oysters and catfish are the basis of the marine fishery. Goa also has a high snake population. Goa has many famous "National Parks", including the renowned [[Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary]] on the island of [[Chorão (Island)|Chorão]]. Other wildlife sanctuaries include the [[Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Molem Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Madei Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary]], and [[Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary]].

Goa has more than 33% of its geographic area under government forests (1224.38&amp;nbsp;km²) of which about 62% has been brought under Protected Areas (PA) of Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Park. Since there is a substantial area under private forests and a large tract under cashew, mango, coconut, etc. plantations, the total forest and tree cover constitutes 56.6% of the geographic area.

Goa's state domestic product for 2017 is estimated at $11&amp;nbsp;billion at current prices. Goa is India's richest state with the highest GDP per capita&amp;nbsp;– two and a half times that of the country&amp;nbsp;– with one of its fastest growth rates: 8.23% (yearly average 1990–2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mohan |first=Vibhor |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Chandigarhs_per_capita_income_highest_in_India/articleshow/3487128.cms |title=Chandigarh's per capita income is highest in India |publisher=The Times of India |date=16 September 2008 |accessdate=16 December 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/684W8KCgm?url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-09-16/chandigarh/27901061_1_capita-income-constant-prices-industrial-growth# |archive-date=31 May 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tourism is Goa's primary industry: it gets 12%&lt;ref&gt;[http://goenkar.com/book/print/112 Economy of Goa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050329161315/http://goenkar.com/book/print/112# |date=29 March 2005 }}, from [http://goenkar.com/ goenkar.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050402083621/http://www.goenkar.com/# |date=2 April 2005 }} verified 2 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; of foreign tourist arrivals in India. Goa has two main tourist seasons: winter and summer. In winter, tourists from abroad (mainly Europe) come, and summer (which, in Goa, is the rainy season) sees tourists from across India. Goa's [[State Domestic Product|net state domestic product]] (NSDP) was around US$7.24 billion in 2015–16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibef.org/states/goa.aspx#login-box|title=About Goa: Tourism, Industries, Economy, Growth &amp; Geography Information|website=www.ibef.org|access-date=2018-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129122956/http://www.ibef.org/states/goa.aspx#login-box#login-box|archive-date=29 November 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land away from the coast is rich in minerals and ores, and mining forms the second largest industry. Iron, bauxite, manganese, clays, limestone and silica are mined. The [[Mormugao]] port handled 31.69 million tonnes of cargo last year, which was 39% of India's total iron ore exports. [[Sesa Goa]] (now owned by Vedanta Resources) and Dempo are the lead miners. Rampant mining has been depleting the forest cover as well as posing a health hazard to the local population. Corporations are also mining illegally in some areas. During 2015–16, the total traffic handled by Mormugao port was recorded to be 20.78 million tones.

Agriculture, while of shrinking importance to the economy over the past four decades, offers part-time employment to a sizeable portion of the populace. Rice is the main agricultural crop, followed by areca, cashew and coconut. Fishing employs about 40,000 people, though recent official figures indicate a decline of the importance of this sector and also a fall in catch, due perhaps, to traditional fishing giving way to large-scale mechanised trawling.

Medium scale industries include the manufacturing of pesticides, fertilisers, tyres, tubes, footwear, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, wheat products, steel rolling, fruits and fish canning, cashew nuts, textiles, brewery products.

Currently there are 16 planned SEZs in Goa. The Goa government has recently decided to not allow any more [[Special Economic Zone|special economic zones]] (SEZs) in Goa after strong opposition to them by political parties and the powerful Goa Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=goasez&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Business/India_Business/Goa_not_to_have_any_more_SEZs_Digamber_Kamat/rssarticleshow/2538932.cms|title=Goa not to have any more SEZs|accessdate=13 November 2007|work=The Times of India|date=13 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011132502/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Business/India_Business/Goa_not_to_have_any_more_SEZs_Digamber_Kamat/rssarticleshow/2538932.cms#|archive-date=11 October 2008|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goa is also notable for its low priced beer, wine and spirits prices due to its very low excise duty on alcohol. Another main source of cash inflow to the state is remittance, from many of its citizens who work abroad, to their families. It is said to have some of the largest bank savings in the country.

Goa is the second state in India to achieve a 100 per cent automatic telephone system with a solid network of telephone exchanges. As of September 2017, Goa had a total installed power generation capacity of 547.88 MW. Goa is also one of the few states in India to achieve 100 per cent rural electrification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goa.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Budget-Speech-2017.pdf|title=Goa Budget 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206190344/https://www.goa.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Budget-Speech-2017.pdf#|archive-date=6 February 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population has a growth rate of 8.23% per decade. There are 394 people for each square kilometre of land which is higher than national average 382 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Goa is the state with highest proportion of urban population with 62.17% of the population living in urban areas. The [[sex ratio]] is 973 females to 1,000 males.

The Goa, Daman and Diu Official Language Act, 1987 makes [[Konkani language|Konkani]] in the [[Devanagari]] script the sole official language of Goa, but provides that [[Marathi language|Marathi]] may also be used "for all or any of the official purposes". [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] was the sole official language during [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colonial rule]]. It is now, however, mostly spoken by only the elderly Portuguese-educated populations and is no longer an official language{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=June 2017}}.The Government also has a policy of replying in Marathi to correspondence received in Marathi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Commissioner Linguistic Minorities |title=42nd report: July 2003&amp;nbsp;– June 2004 |page=para 11.3 |url=http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/35.htm |accessdate =6 June 2007 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071008113359/http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/35.htm |archivedate = 8 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst there have been demands for according [[Konkani in the Roman script]] official status in the state, there is widespread support for keeping Konkani as the sole official language of Goa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navhindtimes.com/story.php?story=2008083147|title=Solving the Language Imbroglio|publisher=[[Navhind Times]]|accessdate=15 October 2008|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65CYoDDnd?url=http://www.navhindtimes.com/story.php?story=2008083147#|archive-date=4 February 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is however notable to mention that the entire liturgy and communication of the Catholic church in Goa is done solely in the Roman script of Konkani.

Konkani is spoken as a native language by about 66.11% of the people in the state but almost all Goans can speak and understand Konkani. Other linguistic minorities in the state as per the 2011 census are speakers of [[Marathi language|Marathi]] (10.89%), [[Hindi language|Hindi]] (10.29%),[[Kannada language|Kannada]] (4.66%) and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] (2.83%).&lt;ref name="demographics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement3.htm|title=Census of India – DISTRIBUTION OF 10,000 PERSONS BY LANGUAGE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|work=censusindia.gov.in|access-date=17 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011050151/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement3.htm#|archive-date=11 October 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1987, Konkani was neither the official nor administrative language used by the various rulers of the State. Under the Kadambas (c. 960 – 1310) the court language was [[Kannada language|Kannada]], a Dravidian language, and when under Muslim rule (1312-1370 and 1469-1510), the official and cultural language was [[Persian language|Persian]]; various stones in the Goa Archaeological Museum from the period are inscribed in Kannada and Persian.&lt;ref name="Thomaz 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomaz |first1=Luís Filipe F.

According to the 2011 census, in a population of 1,458,545 people, 66.1% were [[Hindu]], 25.1% were [[Christian]], and 8.3% were [[Muslim]]. Smaller minorities of about 0.1% each followed [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]], or [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name="census2011" /&gt;

Due to the economic decline of the [[Estado da India]] from the eighteenth century, there was a large scale migration of Goan Catholics. The local Indian Christians were called "indiacatos" and the mixed population, [[mestizos#East Timor, Macau, Goa|mestiços]] by the Portuguese. The population moved from 64.5% Christians and 35% Hindus in 1851 to 50% Christians and 50% Hindus in 1900, with a steady increase in the Hindu proportion from then onwards.&lt;ref&gt;

Over 450 years of Portuguese rule and the influence of the Portuguese culture presents to visitors to Goa a cultural environment that is not found elsewhere in India. Goa is often described as a fusion between Eastern and Western culture with Portuguese culture having a dominant position in the state be it in its architectural, cultural or social settings. The state of Goa is famous for its excellent beaches, churches, and temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://travelfiver.com/5-best-beaches-in-goa/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406163934/http://travelfiver.com/5-best-beaches-in-goa/# |archive-date=6 April 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bom Jesus Cathedral, Fort Aguada and a new wax museum on Indian history, culture and heritage in Old Goa are other tourism destinations.

=== Historic sites and neighbourhoods ===
Goa has two [[World Heritage Sites]]: the [[Bom Jesus Basilica]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goajesuits.in/bomjesus |title=Basilica of Bom Jesus, Old Goa &amp;#124; Parish Ministry &amp;#124; Goa Jesuits |publisher=www.goajesuits.in |accessdate=18 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140615151313/http://goajesuits.in/bomjesus/ |archivedate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Old Goa|churches and convents of Old Goa]]. The basilica holds the mortal remains of [[St. Francis Xavier]], regarded by many Catholics as the [[patron saint]] of Goa (the patron of the [[Archdiocese of Goa]] is actually Saint [[Joseph Vaz]]). These are both Portuguese-era monuments and reflect a strong European character. The relics are taken down for veneration and for public viewing, as per the prerogative of the Church in Goa, not every ten or twelve years as popularly thought and propagated. The last exposition was held in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30160195 |title=Pilgrims flock to Goa to see Saint Francis Xavier remains |publisher=www.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=22 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141124192921/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30160195# |archive-date=24 November 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Jagor", the traditional folk dance-drama, is performed by the Hindu Kunbi and Christian Gauda community of Goa, to seek the Devine Grace for protection and prosperity of the crop. Literal meaning of Jagor is "jagran" or wakeful nights. The strong belief is that the night long performance, awakens the deities once a year and they continue to remain awake throughout the year guarding the village.

Perni Jagor is the ancient mask dance – drama of Goa, performed by Perni families, using well crafted and painted wooden masks, depicting various animals, birds, super natural power, deities, demons and social characters.

Gauda Jagor, is an impression of social life, that displays all the existing moods and modes of human characters. It is predominantly based on three main characters, Gharasher, Nikhandar and Parpati wearing shining dress and headgears. The performance is accompanied by vibrant tunes of Goan folk instruments like Nagara/Dobe, Ghumat, Madale and Kansale.

In some places, Jagor performances are held with participation of both Hindus and Christian community, whereby, characters are played by Hindus and musical support is provided by Christian artistes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=135726|title=17 States and Six Central Ministries to Showcase their Tableaux in Republic Day Parade – 2016|publisher=|access-date=25 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531171642/http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=135726#|archive-date=31 May 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tiatr (Teatro)'' and its artists play a major role in keeping the Konkani language &amp; music alive. Tiatr's are conducted solely in the Roman script of Konkani as it is primarily a Christian community based act. They are played in scenes with music at regular intervals, the scenes are portrayals of daily life and are known to depict social and cultural scenarios. Tiatrs are regularly held especially on weekends mainly at Kala Academy, Panaji, Pai Tiatrist Hall at Ravindra Bhavan, Margao and most recent shows have also started at the new Ravindra Bhavan, Baina, Vasco. Western Musical Instruments such as Drums, bass, Keyboards, Trumpets etc. are part of the show and most of them are played acoustically.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} It is one of Goa's few art forms that is renowned across the world with performances popular among Goans in the Middle-East, Americas and Europe.

=== Food ===
{{Main|Goan cuisine}}[[File:Goan Fish Curry.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional native Goan Fish Curry]]
Rice with fish [[curry]] (''xit koddi'' in [[Konkani language|Konkani]]) is the staple diet in Goa. [[Goan cuisine]] is famous for its rich variety of fish dishes cooked with elaborate recipes. [[Coconut]] and [[coconut oil]] are widely used in Goan cooking along with [[chili pepper]]s, [[spice]]s, and [[vinegar]] is used in the Catholic cuisine, giving the food a unique flavour. The Goan cuisine is heavily influenced by [[Portuguese cuisine]].

Goan food may be divided into Goan Catholic and Goan Hindu cuisine with each showing very distinct tastes, characteristics, and cooking styles. [[Pork]] dishes such as [[Vindaloo|Vindalho]], [[Xacuti]], [[chouriço]], and [[Sorpotel]] are cooked for major occasions among the [[Goan Catholics]]. An exotic Goan vegetable stew, known as [[Khatkhate]], is a very popular dish during the celebrations of festivals, Hindu and Christian alike. Khatkhate contains at least five vegetables, fresh coconut, and special Goan spices that add to the aroma.

[[Sanna (rice cakes)|Sannas]], ''Hitt'', are variants of [[idli]] and ''Polle'', ''Amboli'', and ''Kailoleo'' are variants of [[dosa]]; all are native to Goa. A rich [[egg (food)|egg]]-based, multi-layered sweet dish known as [[bebinca]] is a favourite at Christmas.

There are some places in Goa which are famous for Goa's traditional &amp; special cuisines. [[Ros omelette|Ros omelette]] is one of the most popular snacks and street foods in Goa, it is traditionally sold on food carts on streets.

The most popular alcoholic beverage in Goa is [[Feni (liquor)|feni]]; cashew feni is made from the fermentation of the fruit of the cashew tree, while coconut feni is made from the sap of toddy palms. Urrak is another local liquor prepared from Cashew fruit. In fact the bar culture is one of the unique aspects of the Goan villages where a local bar serves as a meeting point for villagers to unwind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rise of Cashew Feni|url=http://goastreets.com/goa-news/the-heady-rise-of-cashew-feni/|work=goastreets.com|publisher=Goa Streets|accessdate=2 June 2013|author=Joseph Zuzarte|date=14 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601053345/http://goastreets.com/goa-news/the-heady-rise-of-cashew-feni/#|archive-date=1 June 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goa also has a rich wine culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Date With Port|url=http://www.verveonline.com/110/life/scapes-wine.shtml|work=verveonline.com|publisher=[[Verve (magazine)|Verve]]|accessdate=2 June 2013|author=Sheetal Wadhwa Munshaw|date=July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708160840/http://verveonline.com/110/life/scapes-wine.shtml#|archive-date=8 July 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wine and dine in Goa|url=http://www.thewineclub.in/special_feature/1211/wine-and-dine-in-Goa|work=thewineclub.in|publisher=The Wine Club|accessdate=2 June 2013|author=Ashiqa Salvan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515022437/http://www.thewineclub.in/special_feature/1211/Wine-and-dine-in-Goa#|archive-date=15 May 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Costa Residence Margao.jpg|thumb|The House of the Seven Gables in [[Margao]]]]

=== Architecture ===
The architecture of Goa is a combination of Goan, [[Islamic architecture|Ottoman]] and [[Portuguese architecture|Portuguese]] styles. Since the Portuguese ruled and governed for four centuries, many churches and houses bear a striking element of the Portuguese style of architecture. Goan Hindu houses do not show any Portuguese influence, though the modern temple architecture is an amalgam of original Goan temple style with [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian]], [[Hemadpanthi]], Islamic, and Portuguese architecture.&lt;ref name=tempgoa&gt;{{cite book|last=Mankekar|first=Kamla|title=Temples of Goa|year=2004|publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Govt. of India,|isbn= 9788123011615|pages=99 pages(see pages 1–17)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Goan temple architecture fell into disuse as the temples were demolished by the Portuguese and the ''[[Sthapati]]'' known as ''Thavayi'' in Konkani were converted to Christianity though the wooden work and the ''[[Kaavi art|Kavi]]'' murals can still be seen.&lt;ref name=kavi&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamat|first=Krishnanand|title=Konkanyali Kavikala|publisher=Goa Konkani Akademi|location=Panaji}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see:Goa:Hindu temples and deities by Rui Gomes Pereira).

A number of Goans have represented India in football and six of them, namely [[Samir Subash Naik|Samir Naik]], [[Climax Lawrence]], [[Brahmanand Sankhwalkar]], [[Bruno Coutinho]], [[Mauricio Afonso]] and Roberto Fernandes have all captained the national team. Goa has its own [[Goa football team|state football team]] and league, the [[Goa Professional League]]. It is probably the only state in India where cricket is not considered the most important of all sports.

Goa also has its own [[Goa cricket team|cricket team]]. [[Dilip Sardesai]] remains the only Goan to date to play international cricket for [[Indian cricket team|India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mail-archive.com/goanet@lists.goanet.org/msg15601.html |title=[Goanet&amp;#93; Goa Govt. institutes award in memory of Dilip Sardesai |publisher=Mail-archive.com |date=8 August 2007 |accessdate=18 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513065907/http://www.mail-archive.com/goanet@lists.goanet.org/msg15601.html# |archive-date=13 May 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Goa}}
{{See also|List of institutions of higher education in Goa}}
[[File:Goa University, Goa.jpg|thumb|left|[[Goa University]]]]
Goa had India's earliest educational institutions built with European support. The Portuguese set up seminaries for religious education and parish schools for elementary education. Founded circa 1542 by saint Francis Xavier, [[Saint Paul's College, Goa]] was a Jesuit school in Old Goa, which later became a college. St Paul's was once the main Jesuit institution in the whole of Asia. It housed the first printing press in India and published the first books in 1556.

Medical education began in 1801 with the offering of regular medical courses at the Royal and Military Hospital in the old City of Goa. Built in 1842 as the Escola Médico-Cirúrgica de (Nova) Goa (Medical-Surgical School of Goa), [[Goa Medical College]] is one of Asia's oldest medical colleges and has one of the oldest medical libraries (since 1845).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MEDICALEDUCATION CELL-GMC- BAMBOLIM GOA.|url = http://www.gmcmec.gov.in/|website = www.gmcmec.gov.in|accessdate = 1 December 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160109164022/http://gmcmec.gov.in/#|archive-date = 9 January 2016|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It houses the largest hospital in Goa and continues to provide medical training to this day.

According to the 2011 census, Goa has a [[literacy rate]] of 87%, with 90% of males and 84% of females being literate.&lt;ref name="LitRate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://educationforallinindia.com/page157.html |title=District-specific Literates and Literacy Rates, 2001 |accessdate=18 July 2007 |publisher=Education for all in India |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709081028/http://www.educationforallinindia.com/page157.html# |archive-date=9 July 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each taluka is made up of villages, each having a school run by the government. Private schools are preferred over government run schools. All schools come under the [[Goa Board of Secondary &amp; Higher Secondary Education]], whose syllabus is prescribed by the state education department. There are also a few schools that subscribe to the all-India [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|ICSE]] syllabus or the [[National Institute of Open Schooling|NIOS]] syllabus. Most students in Goa complete their high school with English as the medium of instruction. Most primary schools, however, use Konkani and Marathi (in private, but government-aided schools). As is the case in most of India, enrolment for vernacular media has seen a fall in numbers in favour of English medium education. As per a report published in ''[[The Times of India]]'', 84% of Goan primary schools run without an administrative head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Cities/84-Goa-schools-without-heads/articleshow/4363801.cms |title=No Administrative head |accessdate=6 April 2009 |publisher=Times of India |first1=Gauree |last1=Malkarnekar |date=6 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902072435/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Cities/84-Goa-schools-without-heads/articleshow/4363801.cms# |archive-date=2 September 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable schools in Goa include [[Sharada Mandir]] School in [[Miramar, Panaji|Miramar]], [[Loyola High School (Goa)|Loyola High School]] in Margao and [[The King's School, Goa|The King's School]] in [[São José de Areal]]. After ten years of schooling, students join a Higher Secondary school, which offers courses in popular streams such as [[Science]], [[Liberal Arts|Arts]], [[Law]] and [[Commerce]]. A student may also opt for a course in vocational studies. Additionally, they may join three-year [[diploma]] courses. Two years of college is followed by a [[professional degree]] programme. [[Goa University]], the sole [[university]] in Goa, is located in [[Taleigão]] and most Goan colleges are affiliated to it.

There are six [[engineering]] colleges in the state. [[Goa Engineering College]] and [[National Institute of Technology Goa]] are government funded colleges whereas the private engineering colleges include Don Bosco College of Engineering at Fatorda, Shree Rayeshwar Institute of Engineering and Information Technology at Shiroda, Agnel Institute of Technology and Design (AITD), Assagao, Bardez and [[Padre Conceicao College of Engineering]] at Verna. In 2004, [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science|BITS Pilani]] one of the premier institutes in India, inaugurated its second campus, the [[Birla Institute of Technology &amp; Science, Pilani&amp;nbsp;– Goa Campus|BITS Pilani Goa Campus]], at Zuarinagar near [[Dabolim]]. The Indian Institute of Technology Goa (IIT Goa) began functioning from its temporary campus, located in Goa Engineering College since 2016. The site for permanent campus was finalized in Cotarli, [[Sanguem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cotarli-land-for-iit-goa-gets-centres-approval/articleshow/64725207.cms|title=Cotarli land for IIT Goa gets Centre’s approval - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-08-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720134236/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cotarli-land-for-iit-goa-gets-centres-approval/articleshow/64725207.cms#|archive-date=20 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are colleges offering [[pharmacy]], [[architecture]] and [[dentistry]] along with numerous private colleges offering [[law]], [[liberal arts|arts]], [[commerce]] and [[science]]. There are also two National Oceanographic Science related centres: the [[National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research]] in Vasco da Gama and the [[National Institute of Oceanography, India|National Institute of Oceanography]] in [[Dona Paula]].

[[Goa Institute of Management]] located at Sanquelim, near Panaji is one of India's premier business schools.

In addition to the engineering colleges, there are government polytechnic institutions in [[Government Polytechnic, Panaji|Panaji]], [[Bicholim]] and [[Curchorem]], and aided institutions like Father Agnel Polytechnic in Verna and the Institute of Shipbuilding Technology in Vasco da Gama which impart technical and vocational training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dtegoa.gov.in/diploma.html |title=Diploma institutes and courses |accessdate=4 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118223125/http://dtegoa.gov.in/diploma.html |archivedate=18 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==

=== Air ===
[[File:Goa-Vasco 03-2016 12 Dabolim Airport.jpg|thumb|Goa International Airport, new terminal building]]
[[Goa International Airport]], is a [[civil enclave]] at [[INS Hansa]], a Naval airfield located at [[Dabolim]] near [[Vasco da Gama, Goa|Vasco da Gama]]. The airport caters to scheduled domestic and international air services. Goa has scheduled international connections to [[Doha]], [[Dubai]], [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]] and [[Kuwait]] in the [[Middle East]] by airlines like [[Air Arabia]], [[Air India]], [[GoAir]], [[Indigo]], [[Oman Air]], [[SpiceJet]], [[Jet Airways]], JetKonnect and [[Qatar Airways]]. The proposed greenfield [[Mopa Airport]] will be built at [[Mopa, Goa|Mopa]] in [[Pernem]] taluka.

=== Road ===
[[File:Welcome to Tivim Goa.jpg|thumb|Most of Goa is well connected by roads.]]
[[File:Kadamba Tata Marcopolo Starbus Ultra Ac Deluxe.jpg|thumb|left|Government-run Kadamba buses at a bus station in Goa]]

Goa's [[public transport]] largely consists of privately operated buses linking the major towns to rural areas. Government-run buses, maintained by the [[Kadamba Transport Corporation]], link major routes (like the Panaji–Margao route) and some remote parts of the state. The Corporation owns 15 bus stands, 4 depots and one Central workshop at Porvorim and a Head Office at Porvorim.&lt;ref name="ES"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goa.gov.in/pdf/goa-esurvey-2010-2011.pdf |title=Economic Survey 2011–2012 |publisher=Government of Goa |accessdate=21 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525135649/http://www.goa.gov.in/pdf/goa-esurvey-2010-2011.pdf# |archive-date=25 May 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In large towns such as Panajiand Margao, intra-city buses operate. However, public transport in Goa is less developed, and residents depend heavily on their own transportation, usually motorised two-wheelers and small family cars.

[[File:Goa Pilot Vehicle.JPG|thumb|Motorcycle Taxi or "Pilots"]]
Goa has four [[National Highway (India)|National Highways]] passing through it. NH-66 (ex [[National Highway 17 (India)(old numbering)|NH-17]]) runs along India's west coast and links Goa to [[Mumbai]] in the north and [[Mangalore]] to the south. [[National Highway 4A (India)|NH-4A]] running across the state connects the capital Panaji to [[Belgaum]] in east, linking Goa to cities in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The NH-366 (ex [[National Highway 17A (India)|NH-17A]]) connects NH-66 to [[Mormugao]] Port from Cortalim. The new NH-566 (ex NH-17B) is a four-lane highway connecting Mormugao Port to NH-66 at Verna via [[Dabolim Airport]], primarily built to ease pressure on the NH-366 for traffic to Dabolim Airport and Vasco da Gama. NH-768 (ex NH-4A) links Panaji and Ponda to Belgaum and NH-4. Goa has a total of {{convert|224|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} of national highways, {{Convert|232|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} of state highway and {{convert|815|km|abbr=off}} of district highway. National Highways in Goa are among the narrowest in the country and will remain so for the foreseeable future, as the state government has received an exemption that allows narrow national highways. In Kerala, highways are {{convert|45|m|abbr=off}} wide. In other states National Highways are grade separated highways {{convert|60|m|abbr=off}} wide with a minimum of four lanes, as well as 6 or 8 lane access-controlled expressways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalgoa.com/ca_disp.php?id=1428 Goa, Goa Breaking News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304100727/http://www.digitalgoa.com/ca_disp.php?id=1428 |date=4 March 2014 }}.

Hired forms of transport include unmetered taxis and, in urban areas, [[auto rickshaws]]. Another form of transportation in Goa is the [[motorcycle taxi]], operated by drivers who are locally called "pilots". These vehicles transport a single [[pillion]] rider, at fares that are usually negotiated. Other than buses, "pilots" tend to be the cheapest mode of transport.&lt;ref name="Abram2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Abram|title=The Rough Guide to Goa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GGZRtj4OnccC&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=16 December 2012|edition=5|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-081-7|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; River crossings in Goa are serviced by flat-bottomed [[ferry]] boats, operated by the river navigation department.

=== Rail ===
[[File:Margao railwaystation.JPG|thumb|left|Margao railway station]]
Goa has two [[Rail transport|rail lines]] – one run by the South Western Railway and the other by the [[Konkan Railway]]. The line run by the [[South Western Railway zone|South Western Railway]] was built during the colonial era linking the port town of [[Vasco da Gama, Goa]] with [[Belgaum]], [[Hubli]], [[Karnataka]] via [[Margao]]. The Konkan Railway line, which was built during the 1990s, runs parallel to the coast connecting major cities on the western coast.

=== Sea ===
The Mormugao harbour near the city of Vasco handles mineral ore, petroleum, coal, and international containers. Much of the shipments consist of minerals and ores from Goa's hinterland. Panaji, which is on the banks of the Mandovi, has a minor port, which used to handle passenger [[Steamboat|steamers]] between Goa and Mumbai till the late 1980s. There was also a short-lived catamaran service linking Mumbai and Panaji operated by Damania Shipping in the 1990s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15468">'''Hiraṇyagarbha''' ([[Sanskrit]]: हिरण्यगर्भः ; literally the 'golden womb' or 'golden egg', poetically translated as 'universal germ') is the source of the creation of [[universe]] or the manifested [[cosmos]] in [[Vedic philosophy]], as well as an avatar of Vishnu in the [[Bhagavata Purana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266775/Hiranyagarbha Hiranyagarbha] [[britannica.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; It finds mention in one hymn of the [[Rigveda]] ([[Mandala 10|RV 10]].121), known as the '''Hiraṇyagarbha Sūkta''', suggesting a single creator deity (verse 8: ''{{IAST|yo deveṣv ādhi devā eka āsīt}}'', Griffith: "He is the God of gods, and none beside him."), identified in the hymn as [[Prajapati|Prajāpati]]. The concept of the "golden womb" is again mentioned in the [[Vishvakarman]] Sūkta (RV 10.82).

The [[Upanishads|Upanishad]] calls it the Soul of the Universe or [[Brahman]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophy of the Upanishads'', by Paul Deussen, Alfred Shenington Geden. Published by T. &amp; T. Clark, 1906. ''Page 198''.&lt;/ref&gt; and elaborates that Hiraṇyagarbha floated around in emptiness and the darkness of the non-existence for about a year, and then broke into two halves which formed the ''[[Svarga]]'' and the ''[[Prithvi|Pṛthvi]]''.

In classical [[Puranic|Purāṇic]] Hinduism, Hiraṇyagarbha is the term used in the Vedanta for the "creator". Hiraṇyagarbha is also [[Brahma|Brahmā]], so called because he was born from a golden egg ([[Manusmrti|Manu Smṛti]] 1.9), while the [[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]] calls it the Manifest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12c002.htm The Mahābhārata, Book 12: Santi Parva. Kisari Mohan Ganguli, tr. ''Section CCCIII''] ''[[The Mahabharata]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiraṇyagarbha is also a sacrifice, where it is known as Hiraṇyagarbha Yagna. This sacrifice was performed by the founder of the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]], [[Dantidurga]], to confer Kshatriyahood on himself, as he was not born a [[Kshatriya]] but wanted to overthrow his [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] overlord to set up the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakuta]] empire, and in olden days, the [[Caste System in India]] was very prevalent and he was not accepted by the people as their King, until he conferred Kshatriyahood upon himself.

Some classical yoga traditions consider Hiraṇyagarbha as the originator of [[yoga]], though this may also be a name for Rishi [[Kapila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Feuerstein |first= Georg |title= The Yoga Tradition: Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice |year= 2001 |publisher=  Hohm Press|location= Arizona, USA |isbn= 978-1890772185 |page= Kindle Locations 7299–7300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Aranya |first= Swami Hariharananda |authorlink= Swami Hariharananda Aranya |title= Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali with Bhasvati |year= 2000 |publisher= University of Calcutta |location= Calcutta, India |isbn= 81-87594-00-4|page=xxiii-xxiv | chapter = Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
{{Hindu philosophy}}
[[Matsya Purana|Matsya Purāṇa]] (2.25-30) gives an account of initial creation. After [[Mahapralaya|Mahāprālaya]], the great dissolution of the Universe, there was darkness everywhere. Everything was in a state of sleep. There was nothing, either moving or static. Then [[Svayambhu]], self-manifested Being arose, which is a form beyond senses. It created the primordial waters first and established the seed of creation into it. The seed turned into a golden womb, Hiraṇyagarbha. Then [[Svayambhu]] entered in the egg.

The [[Narayana sukta|Nārāyaṇa Sūkta]] exclaims that everything that is, visible or invisible, all this is pervaded by [[Narayana|Nārāyaṇa]] within and without.

The [[Ishavasya Upanishad|Īśvara Upaniṣad]] says that the universe is pervaded by [[Ishvara|Īśvara]] (God), who is both within and without it. He is the moving and the unmoving, He is far and near, He is within all these and without all these.

The [[Vedanta Sutra|Vedānta Sūtra]] further states that Brahman is That from Whom this Universe proceeds, in Whom it subsists, and to Whom, in the end, it returns.

The [[Samkhya|Saṃkhya]] school holds that there are only two primary principles, [[Purusha|Puruṣa]] and [[Prakriti|Prākṛti]], and creation is only a manifestation or evolution of the constituents of [[Prakriti|Prākṛti]] due to the action of [[Purusha|Puruṣa]]'s Consciousness.

The [[Bhagavata]] states that [[Narayana|Nārāyaṇa]] alone was in the beginning, who was the pious of principles of creation, sustenance, and dissolution (also known as the Hindu Trinity of [[Brahma|Brahmā]], [[Vishnu|Viṣṇu]] and [[Shiva]]) - the Supreme [[Hari]], multi-headed, multi-eyed, multi-footed, multi-armed, multi-limbed. This was the Supreme Seed of all creation, subtler than the subtlest, greater than the greatest, larger than the largest, and more magnificent than even the best of all things, more powerful, than even the wind and all the gods, more resplendent than the Sun and the Moon, and more internal than even the mind and the intellect. He is the Creator, the Supreme. The term can also mean as He who, having become first the Creator, has come to be considered as the womb of all objects.

==Hiraṇyagarbha Sūkta==

The Hiraṇyagarbha Sūkta of the [[Rigveda]] declares that God manifested Himself in the beginning as the Creator of the Universe, encompassing all things, including everything within Himself, the collective totality, as it were, of the whole of creation, animating it as the Supreme Intelligence.

===Translation in English===
In the beginning was the Divinity in his [[:wikt:splendour|splendour]], manifested as the sole Lord of land, skies, water, space and that beneath and He upheld the earth and the heavens.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

It is that who bestows soul-force and vigor, whose guidance all men invoke, the Devas invoke whose shadow is immortal life and death.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

It is that who by His greatness became the One King of the breathing and the seeing, who is the Lord of man and bird and beast.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

It is that through whose glory the snow-clad mountains rose, and the ocean spread with the river, they say. His arms are the quarters of the sky.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings ?

It is that through whom the heaven is strong and the earth firm, who has steadied the light and the sky's vault, and measured out the sphere of clouds in the mid-region.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offering?

It is that to whom heaven and earth, placed in the light by his grace, look up, radiant with the mind while over them the sun, rising, brightly shines.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

When the mighty waters came, carrying the universal germ, producing the flame of life, then dwelt there in harmony the One Spirit of the Devas.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

It is that who in its might surveyed the waters, conferring skill and creating worship - That, the God of gods, the One and only One.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

Mother of the world - may that not destroy us who with Truth as his Law made the heavens and produced waters, vast and beautiful.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

Lord of creation! No one other than thee pervades all these that have come into being.

May that be ours, for which our prayers rise, may we be masters of many treasures!

-- ([[Mandala 10|RV 10]]:121)   '''[[Ralph T. H. Griffith]]
'''


1. HIRANYAGARBHA was present at the beginning ;
when born, he was the sole lord of created beings; he
upheld this earth and heaven,

-let us offer worship with
an oblation to the divine KA.

2. (To him) who is the giver of soul, the giver of strength,
Whose commands all (beings), even the gods obey, Whose
shadow is immortality, whose (shadow) is death,

-let us offer worship with an oblation to the divine KA.

3. (To him) who, by his greatness, has verily become
the sole king of the breathing and seeing world, who rules
over this aggregate of two-footed and four-footed beings,-

let us offer Worship with an oblation to the divine KA.

4. Through whose greatness these snow-clad (moun-
tains exist), whose property men call the ocean with the
rivers, whose are these quarters of space, whose are the
two arms,

--let us offer worship with an oblation to the
divine KA.

5. By whom the sky was made profound and the earth
solid, by Whom heaven and the solar sphere were fixed,
who was the measure of the water in the firmament,-

let us offer worship with an oblation to the divine KA.

6. Whom heaven and earth established by his pro-
tection, and, shining brightly, regarded with their mind,
in whom the risen sun shines forth,

-let us offer worship
with an oblation to the divine KA.

7. When the vast waters overspread the universe
containing the germ and giving birth to AGNI, then was
produced the one breath of the gods,

-let us offer worship
with an oblation to the divine KA.

8. He who by his might beheld the waters all around
containing the creative power and giving birth to sacrifice,
he who among the gods was the one supreme god,-

let us offer worship with an oblation to the divine KA.

9. May he do us no harm who is the parent of the
-earth, or who the unerring support (of the world) begat
the heaven, and who generated the vast and delightful
waters,

-let us offer worship with an oblation to the
divine KA.

10. No other than thou, PRAJAPATI, hast given existence to all these beings ; may that object of our desires
for which we sacrifice to thee be ours, may we be the
possessors of riches.

The '''Holocaust Educational Trust''' ('''HET''') is a [[United Kingdom|British]] charity, based in London, whose aim is to "educate young people of every background about the [[Holocaust]] and the important lessons to be learned for today."&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.het.org.uk/content.php?page_id=5| title = About the Holocaust Educational Trust| date = | publisher = Holocaust Educational Trust| accessdate = 24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by the Labour MP [[Greville Janner, Baron Janner of Braunstone|Greville Janner]] and the former Labour Home Secretary [[Merlyn Rees]] in 1988, and is a registered charity in England &amp; Wales&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1092892}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC042996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current chief executive is Karen Pollock, who was awarded an [[MBE]] for her services to Holocaust education in 2012.

Its chairman is Paul Phillips and its president is [[Stephen Rubin]]. Its honorary patrons include [[Lord Carey]], [[Navnit Dholakia, Baron Dholakia|Lord Dholakia]], [[James Mackay, Baron Mackay of Clashfern|Lord Mackay of Clashfern]] and [[Elie Wiesel]].&lt;ref name="report06"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.het.org.uk/docs/annual_report_2006_0.pdf| format =pdf| title = Annual Report 2006|year = 2006| publisher = Holocaust Educational Trust| accessdate = 24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|28}}

One of the Trust's main achievements was ensuring that the Holocaust formed part of the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] for [[history]], as it continues to do so.

The charity changed its logo in 2008. It celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2013.

==Work==
Under its Outreach Programme, the HET arranges visits to schools by Holocaust survivors, often accompanied by one of its own educators.&lt;ref name="report06" /&gt;{{Rp|6}} The trust helps several hundred teachers a year to teach more effectively about the Holocaust, including both [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education|PGCE]] students and practising teachers.&lt;ref name="report06" /&gt;{{Rp|7}} The trust organises an annual intensive ten-day course in [[Israel]] for teachers, in partnership with the International School for Holocaust Studies at [[Yad Vashem]].&lt;ref name="report06" /&gt;{{Rp|15–17}}

===''Lessons from Auschwitz'' Project===
The Trust arranges visits to [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]], by UK region, for two [[sixth-form]] students from participating schools and colleges. Around 150 students take part in one project at any time. A ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' reporter who accompanied such a visit in 1999 wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Trust members knew from experience, both personal and from the teachers' trip to Auschwitz earlier this year, that this visit would be tough... Seeing one horrendous exhibit after another was relentless and exhausting – many of us ended up numb, stunned, freezing cold. Then we felt awful – how dare we find it too much after a few hours?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author = Emily Moore|title = Lessons in death|url = https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,3927499,00.html|work = [[The Guardian]]|page =|date=9 November 1999|accessdate = 24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2006, more than 400 students made such visits.&lt;ref name="report06" /&gt;{{Rp|8–9}} This project is supported by a £1.5 million grant from the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]], enabling two students from every secondary school and further education college in Britain to visit Auschwitz each year. 
The project involves four stages:
* An Outreach seminar, where participants hear a first-hand testimony of a Holocaust survivor
* A one-day trip to the former concentration and death camp, Auschwitz
* A Follow-Up seminar, where participants reflect on their experience at the camp and begin to plan the final stage of the project
* The Next Steps Project, whereby the two participants create their own project to share with their school or local community to pass on the lessons they have learned from visiting Auschwitz.

On 18 October 2012, the Holocaust Educational Trust marked its 100th ''Lessons from Auschwitz'' project trip. Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]] was among those in attendance.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.het.org.uk/index.php/component/content/article/11-cat-news-cat-news/223-news-lfa-100 "Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg accompanies students on Holocaust Educational Trust's 100th Lessons from Auschwitz visit"], Holocaust Educational Trust. Retrieved 23 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2013, the Scottish government announced that it will provide £510,000 of additional funding for the ''Lessons from Auschwitz'' project over the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22384585 "Holocaust Educational Trust gets £500,00 for Auschwitz visits"], ''[[BBC News Online|BBC News]].

===HET Ambassador Programme===
[[File:HET Ambassador Conference 2013 Logo.jpg|thumb|402x402px|HET Ambassador Conference 2013 Logo]]
On 8 July 2013, a groundbreaking seminar for over 500 young people was held in the [[Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre]] in London to mark the launch of the new Ambassador Programme.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;"[http://het.org.uk/index.php/component/content/article/11-cat-news-cat-news/272-news-amcon2013 Hundreds of young people gather to launch Ambassador Programme]" Holocaust Educational Trust.

''Retrieved on 1 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust's Chief Executive, Karen Pollock, describes HET Ambassadors as "young people that have shown a commitment to enabling as many people as possible to benefit from what they have learnt."&lt;ref&gt;[http://het.org.uk/index.php/lessons-from-auschwitz-general/ambassadors "Who Are Ambassadors?"] Holocaust Educational Trust. Retrieved 1 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The 500 young Ambassadors - who have all participated in the Trust's ''Lessons from Auschwitz'' Project - bore witness to speakers including world-renowned historians, Professors [[Yehuda Bauer]] and [[David Cesarani]], [[BBC]] Political Editor, [[Nick Robinson (journalist)|Nick Robinson]] and Director of [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]], [[Shami Chakrabarti]] [[CBE]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As part of the Ambassador Programme, a cohort of 25 Regional Ambassadors (coinciding with the charity's 25th anniversary) were appointed to help strengthen the now 20,000 strong Ambassador community by providing an Ambassador representative for each region in addition to the Trust's Ambassador Outreach Officer. This has secured a visible presence of HET Ambassadors all across the United Kingdom, covering the regions of England (South West, South East, London and Thames Valley Chilterns, Eastern, Yorkshire and Humber and North West, East Midlands, North East, West Midlands), Scotland and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://het.org.uk/index.php/lessons-from-auschwitz-general/ambassadors/regional-ambassadors "Regional Ambassadors"] Holocaust Educational Trust. Retrieved 1 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of 8 July 2013, after the Ambassador Conference, Regional Ambassadors attended a reception in Speaker's House in the [[Palace of Westminster]], along with MPs, Peers and Supporters of the Trust, to celebrate the launch of the Ambassador Programme. Attendees heard from [[John Bercow|the Rt. Hon John Bercow MP]] and [[Lord Browne of Madingley]], the former Chief Executive of [[BP]] and head of the Ambassador Programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/galleries/the-guest-list/john-bercow-hosts-het-ambassadors "John Bercow hosts HET ambassadors"], ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]''. Retrieved on 1 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Browne also chaired a steering group with Regional Ambassadors on 9 July 2013 along with [[Doreen Lawrence]] [[OBE]], Prof. [[Yehuda Bauer]] and Holocaust survivor, [[Kitty Hart-Moxon]], discussing "why and how we remember the Holocaust and how we can communicate its relevance in contemporary British society."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Between 18 and 26 July 2013, for the first time, a select team of young people belonging to the HET Ambassador community, attended a seminar in Holocaust Studies at the [[International School for Holocaust Studies]] at [[Yad Vashem]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/the-holocaust-ambassadors-asked-to-ensure-that-the-crime-is-never-forgotten-8735611.html "The Holocaust ambassadors asked to ensure that the crime is never forgotten"], ''[[The Independent]].'' Retrieved 1 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Hero of the Holocaust award===
From 2008, the Trust campaigned to have British people such as [[Frank Foley]], who had assisted in the rescue of Holocaust victims, posthumously recognised with official British Honours. The Government created the [[British Hero of the Holocaust]] medal, awarding it in March 2010 to 25 people posthumously, as well as to Sir [[Nicholas Winton]] and [[Denis Avey]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph9Mar2010&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/britain-at-war/7407251/Unsung-British-heroes-of-the-Holocaust-awarded-medals.html |title=Unsung British heroes of the Holocaust awarded medals |work =[[Daily Telegraph]]  |accessdate=26 January 2013| author= Blake, Heidi |date=10 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Garcilaso de la Vega''' (12 April 1539 – 23 April 1616), born '''Gómez Suárez de Figueroa''' and known as '''El Inca''' or '''Inca Garcilaso de la Vega''', was a [[chronicler]] and writer born in the [[Spanish Empire]]'s [[Viceroyalty of Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;"A los indios, mestizos y criollos de los reinos y provincias del grande y riquíssimo imperio del Perú, el Inca Garcilasso de la Vega, su hermano, compatriota y paisano, salud y felicidad." (To the Indians, mestizos and natives of the kingdoms and provinces of the large and riquíssimo empire of Peru, the Inca Garcilasso de la Vega, their brother, compatriot and fellow countryman, wishes health and happiness.) Prólogo a ''la Historia General del Perú''&lt;/ref&gt; Sailing to Spain at 21, he was educated informally there, where he lived and worked the rest of his life. The natural son of a Spanish [[conquistador]] and an [[Inca]] noblewoman born in the early years of the conquest, he is recognized primarily for his chronicles of [[Inca]] history, culture, and society. His work was widely read in Europe, influential and well received. It was the first literature by an author born in the Americas to enter the western canon.&lt;ref&gt;Noble David Cook, "Garcilaso de la Vega, el Inca" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 3, pp.32-33. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his father's death in 1559, Vega moved to Spain in 1561, seeking official acknowledgement as his father's son. His paternal uncle became a protector, and he lived in Spain for the rest of his life, where he wrote his histories of the Inca culture and Spanish conquest, as well as an account of [[Hernando de Soto|de Soto]]'s expedition in Florida.

==Early life==
Born '''Gómez Suárez de Figueroa,''' in [[Cuzco, Peru]], in 1539, he was the natural son of a Spanish conqueror and [[encomienda|encomendero]] and a royal Inca mother.&lt;ref name=PCOLLibrosperuanos&gt;[http://www.librosperuanos.com/autores/garcilaso_de_la_vega.html Libros Peruanos. "Inca Garcilaso de la Vega."]&lt;/ref&gt; He was born during the early years of the Spanish conquest. His father was Spanish captain and [[conquistador]] [[Sebastián Garcilaso de la Vega y Vargas]] (d. 1559).&lt;ref name=PCOLLibrosperuanos /&gt; His mother was an Inca princess, [[Palla Chimpu Ocllo]], who was baptized after the fall of Cuzco as [[Isabel Suárez Chimpu Ocllo]]. She was descended from Inca nobility, a daughter of [[Túpac Huallpa]] and a granddaughter (not a niece) of the powerful Inca [[Tupac Yupanqui]].&lt;ref name=PCOLLibrosperuanos /&gt; Because his parents were not married in the Catholic Church, he was illegitimate and the boy was given only his mother's surname. Under the Spanish system of caste that developed, he would have been classified as a [[criollo people|criollo]] (for being of Spanish descent, born in South America) and [[mestizo]] (for his mixed parents).

When Gómez was young, his father abandoned his mother and married a much younger Spanish woman. As such, Gómez lived with his mother, her husband [[Juan de Pedroche]], her Inca family and had two daughters, De la Vega's half-sisters Ana Ruíz, who went on to marry Martín de Bustinza, and Luisa de Herrera, who married Pedro Márquez de Galeoto (one of their children was [[Alonso Márquez de Figueroa]]){{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. His first language was [[Quechua language|Quecha]], but he also learned [[Spanish language|Spanish]] from early boyhood.&lt;ref name=PCOLJose&gt;[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/bib_autor/garcilaso/index.shtml "Inca Garcilaso de la Vega" by José Carlos Rovira and Remedios Mataix.], Cervantes Virtual website&lt;/ref&gt; He lived with his mother's family for the first ten years of his life before his father took the boy into his household and gave him an education. Garcilaso received an inheritance when his father died in 1559. The next year, at the age of 21, he left Peru for Spain.&lt;ref name=PCOLJose /&gt;

==Travel to Spain==
Suárez de Figueroa reached Spain in 1561 while there was still fighting in his native country under the conquest. The Spanish did not achieve their final victory until 1572. He traveled to [[Montilla]], where he met his father's brother, Alonso de Vargas, who acted as the young man's protector and helped him make his way.&lt;ref name=PCOLJose /&gt; The younger man soon traveled to Madrid to seek official acknowledgement as his father's son from the Crown, and he was allowed to take the name of Garcilaso de la Vega.&lt;ref name=PCOLJose /&gt; Also referred to as ''"El Inca"'' or "Inca Garcilaso de la Vega", he received an informal education in Spain. Together with his uncle's support, gaining his father's name helped him integrate into Spanish society.

==Later life==
He remained in Spain and did not return to his native country, now [[Peru]]. As warfare continued in the conquest, he was at political and even physical risk there because of his royal Inca lineage. It is recorded that he died in Córdoba on 23 April 1616, but it could have been up to two days earlier because of the inaccuracy of the existing documents.

==Personal life==
He had at least two sons, born of relationships with different servants. One son was recorded as being born in 1570; he might have died at a very young age. With another servant, Garcilaso had a second son, Diego de Vargas, born in 1590, who helped his father copy the ''Royal Commentaries'' and survived him until at least 1651.

It is possible that his eldest son was the 'Admiral' Lope de Vega, who commanded a ship in the fleet of [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira|Álvaro de Mendaña]], on his 1595 expedition to the [[Solomon Islands]]. Lope de Vega was lost at sea when his ship parted from Mendaña's fleet in a fog.&lt;ref&gt;This claim was inferred by Australian historian [[Lawrence Hargrave]] in a paper to the Royal Society of NSW in 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
De la Vega entered Spanish military service in 1570 and fought in the [[Alpujarras]] against the [[Moors]] after the [[Morisco Revolt]]. He received the rank of captain for his services to the Crown.

==Writings==
[[File:Garcilaso de la Vega La Florida Del Ynca title page 1605.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''La Florida del Ynca'' (1605)]]
[[File:Garcilaso de la Vega Commentarios Reales 1609.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Comentarios Reales de los Incas'' (1609)]]
He received a first-rate but informal European education in Spain after he moved there at age 21. His works are considered to have great literary value and are not simple historical chronicles. He wrote from an important perspective, as his maternal family were the ruling Inca. He portrays the Inca as benevolent rulers who governed a country where everybody was well-fed and happy before the Spanish came. Having learned first-hand about daily Inca life from his maternal relatives, he was able to convey that in his writings. As an adult, he also gained the perspective to describe accurately the political system of tribute and labor enforced by the Incas from the subsidiary tribes in their empire.

Baptized and reared as Christian, he portrayed [[Incan religion]] and the expansion of its empire from a viewpoint influenced by his upbringing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} He did not acknowledge or discuss the human sacrifices that are now known to have been part of Inca practice. It is unknown whether that was an effort to portray his Inca ancestors in a more positive light to a Spanish audience or his ignorance of the practice having lived most of his life in Spain.

===''Historia de la Florida''===
De la Vega's first work was ''La Florida del Inca'', an account of [[Hernando de Soto]]'s expedition and journey in Florida. The work was published in [[Lisbon]] in 1605 and became popular. It describes the expedition according to its own records and information Garcilaso gathered during the years. He defended the legitimacy of imposing the Spanish sovereignty in conquered territories and submitting them to Christian jurisdiction. At the same time, he expresses and defends the dignity, the courage, and the rationality of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. It was translated and published in English in 1951.

Historians have identified problems with using ''La Florida'' as an historical account. [[Jerald T. Milanich]] and [[Charles M. Hudson]] warn against relying on Garcilaso, noting serious problems with the sequence of events and location of towns in his narrative. They say that "some historians regard Garcilaso's ''La Florida'' to be more a work of literature than a work of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Milanich|first1=Jerald T.|last2=Hudson|first2=Charles|title=Hernando de Soto and the Indians of Florida|year=1993|page=6|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-1170-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lankford characterizes Garcilaso's ''La Florida'' as a collection of "[[legend|legend narratives]],"  derived from a much-retold oral tradition of the survivors of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lankford|first=George E.|title=The Expedition of Hernando de Soto West of the Mississippi 1541–1543|year=1993|page=175|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|location=Fayetteville, Arkansas|isbn=1-55728-580-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIt0uRRwPPMC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=reliability+Garcilaso&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Zv3OsOtOeY&amp;sig=p8ZFG-aCXG6-1q7c2_bwMS7DIWo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZreHUpKCCKHJygGzzYCAAw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=reliability%20Garcilaso&amp;f=false|editor=Young, Gloria A |editor2=Michael P. Hoffman|accessdate=16 November 2013|chapter=Legends of the Adelantado}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, DC, has these two volumes online, scanned from an historic French-language edition published long before English editions.

===''Comentarios Reales de los Incas''===
While in Spain, Garcilaso wrote his best-known work, ''[[Comentarios Reales de los Incas]]'', published in Lisbon in 1609. It was based on stories and oral histories told by his Inca relatives when he was a child in Cusco. The ''Comentarios'' have two sections and volumes. The first was primarily about Inca life. The second, about the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]], was published in 1617. It was first published in English in London in 1685, translated by Sir Paul Rycaut and titled ''The Royal Commentaries of Peru.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

More than a century and a half later, in 1758 when the uprising against colonial oppression led by [[Tupac Amaru II]] gained momentum, [[Charles III of Spain]] banned the ''Comentarios'' from being published in the [[Quechua language]] in [[Lima]] or distributed there on account of its "dangerous" content.

The book was not printed again in the Americas until 1918, but copies continued to be circulated secretly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europalatina.fr/site/index.php?lang=fr&amp;selectedid=2122 Video Inca Garcilaso y Tupac Amaru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227120632/http://www.europalatina.fr/site/index.php?lang=fr |date=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated and printed in English in 1961 in the United States as ''The Incas,'' and in another edition in 1965 as ''Royal Commentaries of the Incas''.

[[File:PSM V31 D010 James Fergusson.png|thumb|James Fergusson]]
'''James Fergusson''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (22 January 1808&amp;nbsp;– 9 January 1886) was a Scottish architectural historian, mainly remembered for his interest in Indian historical architecture and antiquities. He was an important figure in the 19th century rediscovery of ancient India. He was originally a businessman, and though not formally trained as an architect, designed some buildings and decorative schemes.

==Life==
Fergusson was born at [[Ayr]], the son of [[William Fergusson (physician)|William Fergusson]] (1773–1846) an army surgeon. After being educated first at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], Edinburgh, and then at a private school in [[Hounslow]], he went to [[Calcutta]] as a partner in a mercantile house. Here he became interested in the remains of the ancient architecture of India, little known or understood at that time.  The successful conduct of an [[indigo]] factory, as he states in his own account, enabled him to retire from business after about ten years and settle in London. His observations on [[Indian architecture]] were first published in his book on ''The Rock-cut Temples of India'', published in 1845.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

The task of analysing the historic and [[aesthetic]] relations of this type of ancient buildings led him further to undertake a historical and critical comparative survey of the whole subject of architecture in ''The Illustrated Handbook of Architecture, being a Concise and Popular Account of the different Styles of Architecture prevailing in all Ages and Countries'', a work which first appeared in 1855 in two volumes. It was followed in 1862 by one entitled ''A History of the Modern Styles of Architecture'', being a sequel to the ''Handbook of Architecture''.

The 1855 work was reissued ten years later in a much more extended form in three volumes, under the title of ''A History of Architecture in all Countries from the Earliest Times to the Present Day.''{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}
[[File:James Ferguson architect.jpg|thumb|left]]
The chapters on [[Indian architecture]], which had been considered at rather disproportionate length in the Handbook, were removed from the general History, and the whole of this subject treated more fully in a separate volume, ''The History of Indian and Eastern Architecture'', which appeared in 1876, as the fourth volume to ''The History of Architecture''. The 1876 work was later revised with additions by James Burgess and [[Richard Phené Spiers]] in 1910 and published in two volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dames|first=M. Longworth|title=''History of Indian and Eastern Architecture'' by James Fergusson; James Burgess; R. Phené Spiers|journal=[[The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]]|date=April 1913|pages=470–474|jstor=25189005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fergusson was the first clearly to point out and characterise the essential difference between this and the spontaneously evolved architecture of preceding ages. His 1849 ''Historical Inquiry into the True Principles of Beauty in Art: More Especially with Reference to Architecture'' is a most thoughtful metaphysical study. Some of his essays on special points in archaeology, such as the treatise on ''The Mode in which Light was introduced into Greek Temples'', included theories on [[Greek temple]]s which have not received general acceptance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

Like many of his contemporaries, Fergusson was concerned about British preparedness to resist a French invasion and he published ''An Essay on a Proposed New System of Fortification: with Hints for its Application to our National Defences'' (1849), ''The Peril of Portsmouth; or, French Fleets and English Forts'' (1852) and ''Portsmouth Protected: a Sequel to the Peril of Portsmouth'' (1856). In 1859, he was the only civilian appointed to the [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;Ramaswami Iyengar, Professor M S and others (1922), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7yQv_AkyG_wC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22james+fergusson%22+portsmouth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=soU6VcWiAoLoaMXEgOAL&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22james%20fergusson%22%20portsmouth&amp;f=false ''Eminent Orientalists: Indian, European, American''], G A Natesan &amp; Co, Madras (pp. 87–88)&lt;/ref&gt; which subsequently recommended a huge programme of coastal fortifications that became known as "[[Palmerston's Follies]]".

He received the gold medal of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in 1871. Among his works, besides those already mentioned, are: ''Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis restored'' (1851), ''Mausoleum at Halicarnassus restored'' (1862), ''Tree and Serpent Worship'' (1868), ''Rude Stone Monuments in all Countries'' (1872), and ''The Temples of the Jews and the other Buildings in the Haram Area at Jerusalem'' (1878). The sessional papers of the [[Institute of British Architects]] include papers by him on ''The History of the Pointed Arch'', ''Architecture of Southern India'', ''Architectural Splendour of the City of Beeja pore'', on the ''Erechtheum'' and on the ''Temple of Diana at Ephesus''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

Although not a prolific practising architect, a small number of examples of Fergusson's architecture remain in existence, the most notable of which are the parliament building of [[Jamaica]],{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} and the [[Marianne North]] Gallery in [[Kew Gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv |origyear=2002 |date=30 November 2004 |title=The Marianne North Gallery |url=http://www.kew.org/heritage/places/mariannenorth.html |publisher=Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120132610/http://www.kew.org/heritage/places/mariannenorth.html |archivedate=20 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fergusson was adviser with [[Austen Henry Layard]] in the scheme of decoration for the [[Assyria]]n court at [[The Crystal Palace]], and in 1856 assumed the duties of general manager to the Crystal Palace Company, a post which he held for two years. In 1866 he was a member of a committee to advise Henry Scott on design aspects of the [[Royal Albert Hall]], along with architects [[William Tite]] and [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]], and the engineers [[John Hawkshaw]] and [[John Fowler (engineer)|John Fowler]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

In 1847 Fergusson published an Essay on the ''Ancient Topography of Jerusalem'', in which he contended that the [[Mosque of Omar]] was the identical church built by [[Constantine the Great]] over the tomb of our Lord at Jerusalem, and that it, and not the present church of the [[Holy Sepulchre]], was the genuine burial-place of Jesus. The burden of this contention was further explained by the publication in 1860 of his ''Notes on the Site of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem''; and ''The Temples of the Jews and the other Buildings in the Haram Area at Jerusalem'', published in 1878, which was a further elaboration of these theories, which are said to have been the origin of the establishment of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

Fergusson died in London on 9 January 1886.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

'''Jim Marrs''', born '''James Farrell Marrs Jr.''' (December 5, 1943&amp;nbsp;– August 2, 2017), was an American newspaper journalist and ''[[New York Times]]'' best-selling author of books and articles on a wide range of alleged cover-ups and [[List of political conspiracies|conspiracies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The truth is way out there |publisher=[[Dallas Observer]] |date=July 6, 2000 |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/issues/2000-07-06/feature.html/page1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000823222702/http://www.dallasobserver.com/issues/2000-07-06/feature.html/page1.html|archivedate=August 23, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marrs was a prominent figure in the [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|JFK assassination conspiracy theories]] community and his book ''Crossfire'' was a source for [[Oliver Stone]]'s film ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]''. He wrote books asserting the existence of government conspiracies regarding [[UFO conspiracy theory|aliens]], [[9/11 conspiracy theories|9/11]], [[telepathy]], and secret societies. He began his career as a news reporter in the [[Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metroplex]] and taught a class on the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] at [[University of Texas at Arlington]] for 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marrs |first=Jim |date=2013|title= Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy - Revised and Updated Edition|location= |publisher= Basic Books|page= Back cover|nopp=y|isbn=978-0-465-03180-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marrs was a member of the [[9/11 Truth movement#Scholars for 9/11 Truth|Scholars for 9/11 Truth]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Atkins (Editor), ''The 9/11 Encyclopedia'', page 125 (ABC-CLIO, LLC, Second Edition, 2011). {{ISBN|978-1-59884-921-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
A native of [[Fort Worth, Texas]], Marrs earned a [[B.A.]] in journalism from the [[University of North Texas]] in 1966 and completed graduate work at [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas]] from 1967 to 1968. Beginning in college, he worked as a reporter, cartoonist, and photographer for several Texas newspapers, including the ''[[Denton Record-Chronicle]]'', ''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]'', and ''Lubbock Sentinel''. In 1968, he took a position with the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'', where he served as police reporter and general assignment reporter covering stories locally, in Europe, and in the Middle East. From 1969 to 1970, he concurrently served in a stateside [[United States Army Reserve]] intelligence unit (under the aegis of the Fourth Army) as a translator of French and German periodicals; when the Army offered to remedy a longstanding shoulder ailment prior to his scheduled mobilization or release him from his service obligation, he accepted the latter option.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kenrahn.com/JFK/The_critics/Marrs/Truth_is_out_there.html&lt;/ref&gt; He later became the newspaper's military and aerospace writer and an [[Investigative journalism|investigative reporter]]. After leaving the ''Star-Telegram'' to take a position with Jerre R. Todd and Associates (a [[public relations]] firm in [[Arlington, Texas]]) in 1972, he returned to the newspaper in 1974 before leaving again in 1980.

==Later media career==
For the remainder of his career, Marrs was a [[Freelancer|freelance writer]], author, and public relations professional based in [[exurban]] [[Springtown, Texas]]. From 1983 to 1984, he published a weekly newspaper (the ''Springtown Current'') in his hometown along with a monthly tourism tabloid (''Cowtown Trails''). Previously, he produced a cable television show (''Texas Roundup'') from 1982 to 1983. He also served as communications director for the First Bank and Trust of Springtown from 1985 to 1995.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/marrs-jim-1943&lt;/ref&gt;

Marrs appeared on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]], [[CNN]], [[C-SPAN]], [[Discovery Channel|The Discovery Channel]], [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]], [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]],  ''[[Alex Jones Show]]'', ''This Morning America''&lt;!--Good Morning America?--&gt;, ''[[Geraldo Rivera|Geraldo]]'', ''[[The Montel Williams Show]]'', ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'', ''[[TechTV]]'', ''[[Larry King]]'', ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' (with [[George Noory]] and [[Art Bell]]) radio programs, as well as numerous national and regional radio and TV shows.

==Opinions==
===Assassination of JFK===
In 1989, Marrs' book, ''Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy'', was published and reached ''[[The New York Times]]'' Paperback Non-Fiction Best Seller list in mid-February 1992.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/23/books/paperback-best-sellers-february-23-1992.html New York Times Archive]'', Paperback Best Sellers February 23, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; It became a basis for the [[Oliver Stone]] film [[JFK (film)|JFK]], released in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Lambert, ''False Witness: The Real Story of Jim Garrison's Investigation and Oliver Stone's Film JFK'', footnote, page 212: "Jim Marrs' ''Crossfire'', an encyclopedia of assassination theories ... enabled Stone to draw on a wealth of information without spending more money on rights to other books." (M. Evans &amp; Company, Inc., 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-87131-920-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Stephen E. Ambrose]] in an essay generally critical of conspiracy theorists, Marrs wrote in ''Crossfire'' that motives for the murder of Kennedy were "Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s attack on [[organized crime]] ([[American Mafia|Mafia]] motive); President Kennedy's failure to support the Cuban exiles at the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] (Cuban and [[Central Intelligence Agency|C.I.A.]] motive); the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|1963 Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty]] ([[military–industrial complex]], or M.I.C. motive); Kennedy's plan to withdraw from Vietnam before the end of 1965 ([[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and M.I.C. motive); Kennedy's talk about taking away the oil-depletion allowance (Texas oil men motive); Kennedy's monetary policies (international bankers motive); Kennedy's decision to drop Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] from the ticket in 1964 (L.B.J. motive) and Kennedy's active civil rights policy (Texas racist billionaires motive)."&lt;ref name="Ambrose"&gt;{{cite news |title=Writers on the Grassy Knoll: A Reader's Guide |first=Stephen E. |last=Ambrose |authorlink=Stephen E. Ambrose |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/22/specials/ambrose-knoll.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York |date=February 2, 1992 |page= |accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sylvia Meagher is a critic of the [[Warren Commission]] and author of ''Master Index to the JFK Assassination'' and ''Accessories After the Fact''.  In April 1987, Meagher received the manuscript of Marrs' ''Crossfire.''  She was asked to evaluate the book by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], which was considering publishing it.  Meagher concluded, "The accuracy of the manuscript in dealing with a vast body of complex evidence is nearly impeccable&amp;nbsp;... the manuscript is, in my opinion, a fine and admirable work." Despite this glowing recommendation, Simon &amp; Schuster became one of about 25 major U.S. publishers to turn down the book.  It was finally published in 1989 by [[Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers]].&lt;ref name="Kelin"&gt;{{cite book |title=Praise from a Future Generation |first=John |last=Kelin |authorlink=John Kelin  |location=San Antonio, TX |year=2007 |page= 467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1976, Marrs taught continuing education classes on the Kennedy assassination as an [[adjunct professor]] at the University of Texas at Arlington. He added a [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] course in 2000 before retiring from teaching in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/community/fort-worth/article165508532.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/marrs-jim-1943&lt;/ref&gt;

===UFOs and other topics===
From 1992 to 1995, Marrs researched and completed a non-fiction book on a top-secret government program called the [[Stargate Project]] involving the [[Parapsychology|psychic phenomenon]] known as [[remote viewing]], only to have the program canceled as the book was going to press in the summer of 1995.

In May 1997, Marrs' investigation of UFOs, ''Alien Agenda'', was published by [[HarperCollins]] Publishers. The paperback edition was released in mid-1998. It has been translated into several foreign languages and became the top-selling UFO book in the world. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marrs shows little discrimination, overemphasizing dubious phenomena like remote viewing and crop circles, and giving nearly equal weight to ludicrous pretenders like [[Billy Meier]] (who claimed close encounter with [[Nordic aliens|Pleiadians]]) and sophisticated commentators like [[Jacques Vallée]]. Marrs even devotes a chapter to theories that the moon may be a UFO, and he refuses to rule out obvious frauds like the alien autopsy tapes. But if rigorous analysis escapes Marrs, little else does; this is the most entertaining and complete overview of flying saucers and their crew in years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-018642-5 "Alien Agenda", ''Publishers Weekly'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In early 2000, HarperCollins published ''Rule by Secrecy'', which claimed to trace a hidden history connecting modern [[Secret society|secret societies]] to ancient and medieval times. This book also reached ''The New York Times'' Best Seller list. In 2003, his book ''The War on Freedom'' probed the alleged conspiracies of the [[September 11 attacks]] and their aftermath. It was released in 2006 under the title ''The Terror Conspiracy''.&lt;ref&gt;'"The Terror Conspiracy"', 2006, The Disinformation Company, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marrs was a featured speaker at a number of national conferences including the annual [[International UFO Congress]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufocongress.com/speakers.html UFO Congress: Speakers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501032653/http://www.ufocongress.com/speakers.html |date=May 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2013}} and the annual Gulf Breeze UFO Conference,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martiansgohome.com/smear/v45/ss980425.htm#conf Saucer Smear: ''Another Gulf Breeze UFO Congress''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415213313/http://www.martiansgohome.com/smear/v45/ss980425.htm |date=April 15, 2007 }}, James W. Moseley, April 25, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; but he also spoke at local conferences, such as [[Conspiracy Con]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://conspiracycon.com/audiotapes.html Conspiracy Con: Video &amp; Audio] (past speakers)&lt;/ref&gt; and The Bay Area UFO Expo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davesjfk.com/ufoexpo.html |title=The Bay Area UFO Expo |publisher=Davesjfk.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last years==
In October 2011, Marrs started his own radio program, ''The View from Marrs'', on the [[Jeff Rense]] Radio network. The program aired on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 3&amp;nbsp;p.m. Central time. Marrs had on his show a wide variety of guests and dedicated the entire month of November to the latest information regarding the JFK assassination. He also explored UFO research, [[survivalism]], and other topics.

With a friend, Michael H. Price, Marrs wrote and illustrated a comic book (''Oswald's Confession &amp; Other Tales from the War'') that was published by Cremo Studios, Inc., in 2012. In February 2013, Marrs' ''Our Occulted History: Do the Global Elite Conceal Ancient Aliens?'' was published by HarperCollins. Marrs usually also held a book signing at Brave New Books in [[Austin, Texas]] at least once a year.

==Private life, Illness and death==
Marrs's avocations included [[American Civil War reenactment]], collecting Civil War memorabilia and researching the history of [[World War II]]. However, according to his wife, Carol, who met him on a [[blind date]] while they were students at the University of North Texas, "[H]e was almost a pacifist. He didn't believe we should be in a war unless you were defending your home."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/community/fort-worth/article165508532.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, an announcement was made on Marrs' official Facebook page about an unspecified illness that caused him to cancel appearances at two upcoming events, the 5th annual Out of this World UFO Conference in [[Edinburg, Texas]], and the Free Your Mind Conference in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], both in April.

In June 2017, additional announcements were made about health issues Marrs was experiencing, including being on [[kidney dialysis]] at home, and problems with his remaining good eye.

Marrs died on August 2, 2017, from a heart attack at age 73.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wcmessenger.com/2017/breaking/jim-marrs-author-and-conspiracy-theorist-dies/|title=Jim Marrs, author and conspiracy theorist, dies|last=Burden|first=Racey|date=|website=WCMessenger|access-date=2 Aug 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Morris''' "'''J. M.'''" '''Roberts''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (14 April 1928 – 30 May 2003) was a British [[historian]], with significant published works. From 1979 to 1985 he was [[vice chancellor]] of the [[University of Southampton]], and from 1985 to 1994, Warden of [[Merton College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. He was also well known as the author and presenter of the [[BBC]] TV series ''The Triumph of the West'' (1985).

==Biography==
Roberts was born in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]],&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20100831035654/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/j-m-roberts-548254.html&lt;/ref&gt; the son of a department store worker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1432378/J-M-Roberts.html|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and educated at [[Taunton School]]. He won a scholarship to [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]], Oxford, and took a first in [[Modern History]] in 1948. After [[National Service]], he was elected a prize fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], Oxford, where he completed a doctoral thesis on [[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|the Italian republic set up during the time of Napoleon Bonaparte]].

''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' described Roberts as "master of the broad brush-stroke".
In 1953 Roberts was elected a fellow and tutor in Modern History at Merton College, Oxford, and in the same year went as a [[Commonwealth Fund]] fellow to [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Yale]], where his interests broadened beyond European history. He returned to America three times as a visiting professor in the 1960s. From 1979 to 1985 Roberts was vice-chancellor of the [[University of Southampton]] where he felt obliged to make unpopular cuts ([[Classics]] and [[Theology]]). In 1985 Roberts wrote and presented the thirteen-part BBC series ''The Triumph of the West'', and was later historical advisor to the series ''[[People's Century]]''. From 1985 to 1994 Roberts was [[Warden of Merton College, Oxford]] until his retirement, whereupon he returned to his native Somerset.

In 1996, Roberts was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] for his 'services to education and history' and made a Cavalier of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1432378/J-M-Roberts.html|website=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Roberts died in 2003, at [[Roadwater]], [[Somerset]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/j-m-roberts-548254.html|title=J. M. Roberts  Influential historian with a taste for academic leadership|last=Gildea|first=Robert|date=3 June 2003|work=The Independent|accessdate=2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; shortly after completing the fourth revised edition of his ''The New History of the World''.

==Legacy==
The John Roberts Memorial Fund was established in his honour at Merton College in 2003, with the aim of increasing the financial support available to [[undergraduate]] and [[graduate student]]s.  The college hoped that the first recipient would be a history graduate.

When Roberts' ''The Mythology of the Secret Societies'' was republished in 2008, the back cover contained the following message: "We are living at a time when [[conspiracy theories]] are rife and the notion of secret plans for world domination under the guise of religious [[cults]] or secret societies is perhaps considered more seriously than ever."

==Personal life==
On 10 September 1960, at [[Milton Abbas]], Roberts married (Mariabella) Rosalind Gardiner. The marriage was dissolved in 1964. At Oxford on 29 August 1964 Roberts married Judith Cecilia Mary Armitage, a schoolteacher, and they had one son and two daughters.&lt;ref name = "ODNB"&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/89999 Colin Lucas: ''Roberts, John Morris (1928–2003)'', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Jan 2007, online edn, Oct 2009, accessed 14 Aug 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dr. Juan Álvarez, por Erminio Blotta.jpg|thumb|150px|Bust of the founder, by [[Erminio Blotta]], at the secondary entrance (Garden Library) [[Rosario, Argentina]]]]

'''Juan Álvarez''' (3 September 1878 &amp;ndash; 8 April 1954) was a judge and historian born in [[Gualeguaychú, Entre Ríos|Gualeguaychú]], {{province|Entre Ríos|Argentina}}.

==Biography==

Álvarez was born at a time of massive [[immigration]] in Argentina. His father, Serafín Álvarez, was an exiled Republican [[Spain|Spaniard]]; within the family, discussions about society, politics and religion were common.  He studied at the Faculty of Law in [[Buenos Aires]], where the ruling class of the time was raised. His doctoral thesis was evaluated by [[Bartolomé Mitre]].

Since 1902, he worked at the Tribunals of [[Rosario]], as a secretary, attorney, prosecutor and judge. He lived most of his life in this dynamic and rapidly growing city of the province of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], and made friends within the professional and business elite, as well as firm links with other Argentine intellectuals. He was of a liberal mindset, opposed to [[nationalism]] and the tendency to worship tradition.

His first books argued that the roots of a nationality should not be sought in the old times, but in the future. This topic was especially relevant due to the wave of nationalistic pride sweeping Argentina near the centennial of its liberation from Spain (the [[May Revolution]] of 1810). In his ''Essay on the history of Santa Fe'' he went as far as claiming that Argentine history is nonexistent before 1853 (year of the framing of [[Constitution of Argentina|Constitution]]).

[[Image:Biblioteca Argentina Rosario 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The main entrance of the ''Biblioteca Argentina'' on Presidente Roca St., Rosario.]]

In 1913, Álvarez founded a public library in Rosario. This library, which is the largest in the city, carries at present the name of ''[[Biblioteca Argentina Dr. Juan Álvarez]]''.

In 1914, Álvarez wrote about the civil wars of Argentina from an economic point of view, and explicitly looking to prevent similar wars in the future. [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] affected his liberal mindset, which led him to write a criticism of liberalism and its limitations. Similar crises came after the [[Sáenz Peña Law]] of secret and compulsory suffrage and the [[Década Infame|conservative revolution of 1930]]. Álvarez turned towards conservatism, unsure about the new developments in the relationship between citizens, institutions and the state.

In 1943, he wrote ''Historia de Rosario (1689&amp;ndash;1939)'' ("History of Rosario"), which, like other works that deal with the interaction of geography, economy and politics, is considered a seminal work, which introduces the concept of the city as a subject matter, starting from its local identity, without a forced reference to national matters.  His thesis about the asymmetric relationships between his adopted home town, Rosario, and the capital city of Santa Fe, opposes the dynamism of the former (devoid of a colonial past or an aristocratic class) and the bureaucratic tradition of the latter. This idea is still considered valid and continues to re-emerge in popular and intellectual discourse today.

Álvarez was the Attorney General of the Nation between 1935 and 1946. He died in Rosario in 1954.

'''''Laden VS USA''''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 本·拉登世紀大挑戰：Laden VS USA; [[pinyin]]: ''Běn Lādēng shìjì dàtiǎozhàn''; lit. ''Bin Laden's Challenge of the Century'') is a [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[handheld electronic game]] supposedly created by Chinese company Panyu Gaming Electronic Co. Ltd.. It is unknown if the company actually manufactured the game due to mass counterfeiting in China. ''Laden VS USA'' was also released in two different designs. The game is based on the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] and features pictures of the actual wreckage on the packaging. ''Laden VS USA'' also bears the marks of "Made in China" and "Ages 5 and Up" on the packaging.

''Laden VS USA'' has received negative reviews and is very controversial. The game has also been banned from two stores; one in Warrington, Cheshire, England and the other in Brooklyn, New York, United States.

==Gameplay==
The player controls a submarine travelling across the bottom of the screen shooting at fighter jets flying by. The game is divided into 20 levels and automatically levels you up to the next. When a level is completed the game plays a pinging version of "[[Deck the Halls]]". The higher the level, the more difficult the game becomes. ''Laden VS USA'' is based on the [[9/11]] incident in 2001 all superimposed over a 9/11 photograph.&lt;ref name="FAILToy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadlinelive.info/2009/12/22/fail-video-game-bin-laden-vs-usa-hand-held-toy-review-by-mike-mozart-of-jeepersmedia/ |title=Fail Video Game Bin Laden VS USA Hand Held Toy Review by Mike Mozart of JeepersMedia |date=December 22, 2009 |publisher=DeadlineLIVE |accessdate=December 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SunTzu"&gt;{{cite book |last=Halter |first=Ed |title=From Sun Tzu to Xbox: War and Video Games |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cp3p6rfKdK0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |accessdate=September 27, 2009 |edition=1 |date=June 2006 |origyear=2006 |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |location=245 West 17th Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10011 |isbn=1-56025-681-8 |oclc=68918463 |id=cp3p6rfKdK0C |chapter=Part 4: The Dream War |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=cp3p6rfKdK0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the game is about the 9/11 attacks, the instructions on the back of the packaging appear to have been lifted word for word from the blurb of a boxing game,&lt;ref name="911game"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/106138/911-video-game-upsets-otherwise-docile-residents-of-brooklyn-chelsea |title=9/11 Video Game Upsets Otherwise Docile Residents Of Brooklyn, Chelsea |author=Jessica |date=June 2, 2005 |publisher=Gawker |accessdate=December 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006021311/http://gawker.com/106138/911-video-game-upsets-otherwise-docile-residents-of-brooklyn-chelsea |archivedate=October  6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the gameplay is seemingly unrelated.

==History==
[[File:Laden VS USA 2.jpg|110px|left|thumb|The second model of ''Laden VS USA'']]
The game is supposedly manufactured by Chinese company Panyu Gaming Electronic Co. Ltd. located in [[Guangzhou, China]].&lt;ref name="SunTzu" /&gt; Panyu Gaming Electronic used technology almost two decades old when creating the game.&lt;ref name="SunTzu" /&gt; Due to mass counterfeiting in China it is not certain whether the company actually created the game. The video game is the first to use the September 11 attacks as a main plot device. The game was released in two models, the first being GM-026A-3 and the second GM-028A-3. The first model can come with yellow or white buttons.&lt;ref name="PakistaniToys"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.life.com/image/1725084 |title=Pakistani Toys Feature Osama Bin Laden |first=Syed |last=Zargham |date=January 14, 2003 |work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |publisher=See Your World L.L.C. |location= |accessdate=December 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/GF03Ae01.html |title=Cashing in on Osama |first=Richard S. |last=Ehrilch |date=June 3, 2003 |work=Asia Times |publisher=Asia Times Online, Ltd. |location=Unit B, 16/F, Li Dong Building, No. 9 Li Yuen Street East, Central, Hong Kong |accessdate=December 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was also released with pictures of actual 9/11 wreckage on the packaging and pictures of [[George W. Bush]] and Osama bin Laden on the console.&lt;ref name="FAILToy" /&gt; The packaging also bears the marks "Made in China" on the packaging, and is recommended for "Ages 5 and Up".&lt;ref name="SunTzu" /&gt; Upon the game's release it was unrated by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB).

''Laden VS USA'' is also an example of the growing political and cultural impact of video games. The game can be compared to other controversial video games such as ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' or ''[[Ghost Recon]]''. ''Laden VS USA'' also presents an unusual challenge to journalists, scholars and historians for its inherent value as classic war [[propaganda]]. ''Laden VS USA'' also provides an interesting example as a non-American cash in to contemporary conflicts, similar to the game ''Final Battle Afghanistan X-Tank''.&lt;ref name="SunTzu" /&gt; The game is also notably very rare but can sometimes be found on [[eBay]].&lt;ref name="FAILToy" /&gt;

''Laden VS USA'' has become popular among Pakistani children.&lt;ref name="PakistaniToys" /&gt; Despite this the game is very controversial and has even been banned from the shelves of a discount store in Warrington, Cheshire, England after several protests from religious leaders. Teenager Hannah Birchall stated about the incident, "The images on the box bring back all the memories of September 11", and that she thinks that "it will desensitise children to what happened".&lt;ref name="Twintowersgame"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/jan/17/games.september112001 |title=Shop bars twin towers game |first=Helen |last=Carter |author2=Shaukat Rashid |author3=Michael Finlay |author4=Imran Sodawala |author5=Hannah Birchall |author6=Kim Walmsley  |date=January 17, 2005 &lt;!-- 00:24 GMT --&gt;  |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |location=Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU |accessdate=December 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has also created controversy in the town of Brooklyn, Chelsea, USA where pedestrians were outraged over the presence of the game in the local store named Oakdale Dairy.&lt;ref name="911game" /&gt; [[YouTube]] toy reviewer [[Mike Mozart]] of JeepersMedia considered ''Laden VS USA'' "the worst concept for a game in history" and said that "it boggles the mind that it was actually manufactured and sent to the United States".&lt;ref name="FAILToy" /&gt;

'''Luigi Firpo''' (1915 in [[Turin]] &amp;ndash; 1989 in Turin) was an Italian historian and politician.

He taught history of political thought at the [[University of Turin]]. He has been credited as "an excellent editor and lucky finder of texts" which were particularly influential in the study of [[Tommaso Campanella]].&lt;ref name="Garin2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garin|first=Eugenio|title=History of Italian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVP3vBmDktQC&amp;pg=PA1232|accessdate=30 November 2012|year=2008|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9789042023215|pages=1232–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcia Crosby''' is [[Tsimshian]]-[[Haida people|Haida]] writer, art historian, and educator from [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vancouverartinthesixties.com/people/21|title=Marcia Crosby|first=Belkin|last=Gallery|website=vancouverartinthesixties.com|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Crosby is of ancestry, originating from the Maxxtakxaata ([[Metlakatla, Alaska]]), and Gisbutwaada (Killer Whale clan), and House of Gitlan.&lt;ref name="grunt.ca"&gt;http://www.grunt.ca/indianacts/crosby.swf&lt;/ref&gt; Born and raised in her maternal grandmother's territory, Marcia grew up on what is now [[Prince Rupert]].  She has a Bachelor of Arts in Fine Arts and English (1990), a Master of Arts, "Indian Art/Aboriginal Title" in Cultural History (1993), and a Doctorate of Philosophy in Art History, all from the University of British Columbia.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  Her MA thesis focused on the tension between representations of Aboriginal cultures and peoples in the public sphere, the work of Indigenous art and artists, and representations of Aboriginal title in British Columbia.&lt;ref name="contemporaryartgallery.ca1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporaryartgallery.ca/events/feedback-talk-marcia-crosby/|title=Feedback Talk - Marcia Crosby - Vancouver Contemporary Art Gallery|website=contemporaryartgallery.ca|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby's PhD dissertation is on, ‘self-identifying modern Indian artists.’&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Crosby started teaching English literature and First Nations Studies at [[Vancouver Island University]] in 1996 (previously Malaspina College).&lt;ref name="grunt.ca"/&gt; Crosby has worked as a researcher, reviewing Aboriginal programs in public institutions.&lt;ref name="contemporaryartgallery.ca1"/&gt; Crosby's works in literature and curatorial practices have continually interrogated mainstream representations and the historical narratives of First Nations peoples and cultures.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Curatorial practice ==  
Crosby was a guest curator and writer for the Contemporary Art Gallery's exhibition "Nations in Urban Landscape" (1994).&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; This exhibit toured to Oboro, Montreal in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporaryartgallery.ca/shop/publications/nations-in-urban-landscapes/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214010002/http://www.contemporaryartgallery.ca/shop/publications/nations-in-urban-landscapes/ |archivedate=2014-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shelly Niro]], [[Faye HeavyShield]] and Eric Robertson are some of the artists referenced in her, "Nations in Urban Landscape" exhibition catalogue.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In "Nations in Urban Landscape" Crosby investigates the geo-political discourse between Canadian and First Nations governments over the land issues that have shaped cultural practices in museums and galleries.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Starting in 2008, Crosby began participating in the web project, "Ruins in Progress: Vancouver Art in the Sixties" in association with the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery.&lt;ref name="contemporaryartgallery.ca1"/&gt;  Included on this site is an essay by Crosby titled, "Making Indian Art ‘Modern’" where Crosby writes, "What complicates any exploration of this historical stage is the situation in which artists and others struggled to become modern.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vancouverartinthesixties.com/essays/making-indian-art-modern|title=Making Indian Art "Modern"|first=Belkin|last=Gallery|website=vancouverartinthesixties.com|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the mid1960s, there was no sustained economic or/and institutional or private support from patrons (including collectors of contemporary aboriginal art), nor an established intellectual discourse to create value for ‘modern Indian’ art."&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Crosby writes about [[George Clutesi]], Henry Speck, [[David Neel]] and others and their vision to be modern integrated artists during the sixties.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Crosby explains that because of their art practices there was an invocation of upward social mobility which succeeded in integrating the formalist discourse of Northwest coast ‘fine art’ into both museum and art galleries, which paradoxically eclipsed many these early artists and their histories.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Crosby's work for this website was the first step in framing her PhD dissertation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  Since 2001, Crosby has written on contemporary art history topics as diverse as the myth of [[Bill Reid]], the sculptural works of Dina Gomez, an Argentinian artist living and working in Vancouver, and aboriginal performance art, which included two published essays on the multi-media works of [[Rebecca Belmore]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 2012, Crosby acted as a co-curated with Karen Duffek at the Vancouver Belkin and Satellite Gallery's show, "The Paintings of Henry Speck: Udz’stalis."&lt;ref name="contemporaryartgallery.ca1"/&gt; Henry Speck (1908-1971) is a kwakwaka’waka artist who became a "newly discovered phenomenon" in 1964, when his paintings of masked dancers, coastal creatures, and sea monsters were shown at Vancouver's New Design Gallery.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satellitegallery.ca/projections.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215002224/http://www.satellitegallery.ca/projections.html |archivedate=2014-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marcia Crosby is introduced in the exhibition excerpt as a writer, scholar, and PhD candidate, UBC Department of Art History, Visual Art, and Theory).&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; In the exhibition catalogue "Projections: The Paintings of Henry Speck, Udzi’stalis" Karen Duffek, and Marcia Crosby have a formal dialogue where they discuss Specks place in "Indian art" history.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satellitegallery.ca/download/MOA-Satellite_Projections.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215001948/http://www.satellitegallery.ca/download/MOA-Satellite_Projections.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby states, "I don’t think Speck and his work ‘slipped away’ so much as the genealogy of ‘modern art’ by Aboriginal artists cannot account for such qualities as their traditional, metaphysical referents, or their seemingly positivist focus on form."&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

In July 2013, Crosby held a "Feedback" talk for the [[Contemporary Art Gallery (Vancouver)]] in response to Itee Pootoogook's exhibit "Buildings and Lands".&lt;ref name="contemporaryartgallery.ca1"/&gt; Pootogook's exhibition included a series of large-scale graphite and coloured pencil drawings depicting images of modern northern life distinctly different from the accustomed historical images seen in Inuit work.&lt;ref name="contemporaryartgallery.ca2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporaryartgallery.ca/exhibitions/itee-pootoogook-buildings-and-land/|title=Itee Pootoogook - Buildings and Land - Vancouver Contemporary Art Gallery|website=contemporaryartgallery.ca|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of traditional subjects such as igloos and parka-clad hunters, Pootogook shows her audience everyday works, one made up of recognizable contemporary accouterments including snowmobiles, boats, soft drinks, and television sets.&lt;ref name="contemporaryartgallery.ca2"/&gt;  Crosby's formal discussion on the Pootogook's exhibit heavily reflected upon some of the aspects researched and developed in her PhD.&lt;ref name="contemporaryartgallery.ca1"/&gt; Crosby writes in her thesis, "Setting up cultural institution in the heroic position of saviors of First Nations cultures bypasses the more important issue of addressing how that ‘need’ was created in the first place.  Certainly, it can be stated that many First Nations individuals and communities today recognize that accessing the information recorded by ethnographers, anthropologists, archeologists, political scientists, art historians and curators is very important to filling in the historical gaps in local knowledge- which exist because of the many colonialist projects for assimilation and cultural genocide...Who benefits from whom is a historically specific and complex question."&lt;ref&gt;[https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/id/14080/ubc_1994-0400.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby’s Feedback at the Contemporary Art Gallery included a focus on the formation of Aboriginal cultural production in urban spaces in Vancouver, B.C., for Native and non-Native publics.&lt;ref name="contemporaryartgallery.ca1"/&gt; More specifically, Crosby focuses on the diverse forms of performativity, the display and sale of Aboriginally produced objects, and urban community supports by well-known First Nations artists through their association with new Aboriginal social organizations.&lt;ref name="contemporaryartgallery.ca1"/&gt;

== Construction of the Imaginary Indian ==
An important work by Marcia Crosby is her "Construction of the Imaginary Indian" an essay included in Janet Giltrow book, "Academic Reading, second edition: Reading and Writing Across the Disciplines." In the text, Crosby makes clear her goal to analyze the current state and recent phenomenon in the arts and social sciences where an embracing of ‘difference’ is taking place.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby 2002, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby makes transparent her experiences at university and the importance of the trials and tribulations she faced.  She writes, "At the time, I felt only the discomfort of being wedged between the limits of who my professor thought I was and what that person was capable of accomplishing.  As I continued studying the Euro-Canadian interaction with First Nations people, both in the visual arts and in literature, I saw a composite, singular ‘Imaginary Indian’ who functioned as a peripheral but necessary component of Europeans’ history in North America- the negative space of the ‘positive’ force of colonialist hegemony."&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Crosby 2002, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; The ‘Imaginary Indian’ is a fictionalization of past and present cultures by the west and Crosby elaborates on this throughout her essay.  Crosby shapes an argument focused on the precautions about western historizing indigenous people as illusory and an inscribing in past cultures a need to be saved through colonization and civilization.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; However, "Construction of the Imaginary Indian" does not take a primarily negative stance.  In fact, Crosby writes about how the interest in aboriginal culture, in turn, created a space for native people to enter the art arena, which has in part provided a forum for many First Nations people to speak to current social and political issues.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Crosby 2002, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; During her four years at university, Crosby studied and researched individuals who supposedly presented positive images of native people including: [[Paul Kane]], [[Emily Carr]], and [[Bill Reid]].&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

As one of the less than one per cent of First Nations students who attend post-secondary institutions,&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; Crosby found a collection of artists whose work prompted images of past cultures.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;  [[Emily Carr]] and her retrospective at the National Gallery of Canada in the summer of 1990 is a major focus in "Construction of the Imaginary Indian."&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;Crosby 2002, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;  Crosby points out that Carr paints the remaining traces of Indian culture such as totem poles and canoes.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby 2002, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; This artistic decision on Carr's behalf speaks to what Crosby interprets as an ambition to record others.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;Crosby 2002, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;  In her text, Crosby questions this further by interrogating the subjects in Emily Carr's paintings. Crosby writes, "Carr paid a tribute to the Indians she ‘loved’" but who were they?"&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;Crosby 2002, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; "The Construction of the Imaginary Indian" argues Carr's paintings can be seen as a recording of relics or ethnographic depictions.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;  In Crosby's eyes, Carr was searching for a Canadian identity and also recognition for acting honorably.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt; Crosby writes, "At this time, when the struggles of First Nations people for aboriginal rights and self-identity are being widely publicized, it is inappropriate, I think, for an art historian to describe Carr’s remarks as a ‘statement of high moral purpose.’"&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;  Carr is not alone is being perceived by art historians this way, Paul Kane’s work and reception by the public is also unpacked in Crosby’s essay.

In "Construction of the Imaginary Indian" Crosby writes that [[Paul Kane]]’s texts and images reflect nineteenth-century philosophical, religious and political views about indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; Crosby adds, Kane’s ‘historical documents’ have transcended time with a message that is still embraced by some art historians and government officials.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; However, Kane's work today can be read as a detriment of First Nations people because his work became a rationale for denying aboriginal rights, because according to Kane being Indian meant being a savage.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; Clearly, Crosby finds Kane's claims of authenticity problematic.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; Paul Kane was committed to making journals in the hopes that they would become intrinsic or essential in value for historians.&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;Crosby 2002, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby states that when a culture is represented as going through fatal changes, the natural thing to do is salvage or save it.&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt; "Construction of the Imaginary Indian" sheds light on the fact that Kane's’ success depended on the inevitable death of a primitive people and industrial's fascination with such individuals.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; Bill Reid's work moves slightly away from acting like a recording or documenting, when compared to Kane's journals.&lt;ref name="auto11"&gt;Crosby 2002, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Reid]] is introduced in Crosby's text as a central figure in this revival of Indian art.&lt;ref name="auto12"&gt;Crosby 2002, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby introduces Bill Reed as a Haida artist who took part in the so-called renaissance of Northwest Coast Indian art.&lt;ref name="auto11"/&gt; Crosby writes, "In this vein, others besides Reid have been cited as saviors of native culture."&lt;ref name="auto12"/&gt; In "Construction of the Imaginary Indian" the media's response to marginalized cultures within the postwar context is made central.&lt;ref name="auto12"/&gt; In reciprocation to the publicizing of the apparent hardships of a culture there is a general global cry for decolonization and independence for non-Western nations (280). Reid has stated he: "wants to be taken on his own, engaged in the making of art, not Indian art."&lt;ref&gt;Crosby 2002, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; In her text, Crosby responds to this by commenting on political meaning behind his supposed autonomous art practice. Crosby writes, "Reid has actively supported the myth of the imminent death of the Indian, by identifying himself as hero and cultural saviour."&lt;ref&gt;Crosby 2002, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Reid's work follows a rubric that promotes the dominant culture's assumption that is not only their obligation but their right to assume the responsibility of caring for a dying culture, that within the museum setting, becomes a homogeneous collection of Indian artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby 2002, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby writes, "The Indian was neatly contained within the institutional glass case, carefully locked away as a repository for the unthinkable or unspeakable parts of those who created it."&lt;ref name="auto11"/&gt; Reid's work like Carr and Kane reinforces the myth of the artist while also underlining a culture's apparent helplessness.

It is important to note that in "Construction of the Imaginary Indian" Crosby includes a list of the individuals who have contributed to her conclusions on the ‘Imaginary Indian.’  Crosby writes, "However, the critical and protesting voices of [[Linda Nochlin]], Heather Dawkins, [[Edward Said]], Terry Goldie, [[Trinh T. Minh-ha]], Marnie Fleming, James Clifford, Virgina Dominguez and many others confirmed the legitimacy of my discomfort at the disparity between what was imagined, written or said, and what was implied &lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; In "Manifest Matters", [[Gerald Vizenor]] writes, "The postindian warriors hover at last over the ruins of tribal representations and surmount the scriptures of manifest manners with new stories; these warriors counter the surveillance and literature of dominance with their own simulations of survivance."&lt;ref&gt;Vizenor 1994, p. 1978&lt;/ref&gt;  Crosby does more than ‘collect and display Indians as objects’ as human specimens rather her writing speaks to a personal experience and personal connection with past and present cultures with a sensitivity that is supported by dedicating years to building upon an education.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby 2002, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;  Included in [[Wendy Stewart]], Audrey Huntley and Fay Blaney's, "The Implication of Restorative Justice for Aboriginal Women"(2001) is a quotation by Marcia Crosby:&lt;ref name="dal.ca"&gt;[http://dalspace.library.dal.ca/bitstream/handle/10222/10285/AWAN%20Research%20RJ%20and%20Aboriginal%20Women%20EN.pdf?sequence=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

"I can hardly speak your words because I think you might not forgive me for telling the story you wanted kept a secret.  Yes, some of out leaders, some of our old people and others on our communities want us to be quiet about life on our social and geographical reserves.  They want us to be silent and if we are not we are not family.  But your silence deadened me gram.  This is about love and anger.  This is about sadness and joy. About strength and total collapse of the spirit."&lt;ref name="dal.ca"/&gt;

This quotation included in "The Implication of Restorative Justice for Aboriginal Women" is reinforcement for how dedicated Crosby is in making works that offers a spirit, honor and resistance.&lt;ref name="dal.ca"/&gt;

[[Image:Martin von Troppau.PNG|266px|thumb|Martin of Opava, O.P., depicted as the  Archbishop of Gniezno, (in an [[illuminated manuscript]] from sometime before 1535)]]
'''Martin of Opava''', O.P. (died 1278) also known as '''Martin of Poland''', was a 13th-century [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]], [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] and [[chronicler]].

==Life==
Known in [[Latin language|Latin]] as ''Frater Martinus Ordinis Praedicatorum'' (Brother Martin of the [[Dominican Order|Order of Preachers]]), he is believed to have been born, at an unknown date, in the [[Czech Silesia|Silesia]]n town of [[Opava]] (German: Troppau), at that time part of the [[Margraviate of Moravia]]. Thus in [[German language|German]] he appears as ''Martin von Troppau'' and in [[Czech language|Czech]] as ''Martin z Opavy''.

From the middle of the 13th century, Martin was active in [[Rome]] as [[confessor]] and [[chaplain]] for [[Pope Alexander IV]] and his successors, [[Pope Urban IV]], [[Pope Clement IV]], [[Gregory X|Pope Gregory]], [[Pope Innocent V]], [[Pope Adrian V]] and [[Pope John XXI]] (d. 1277), the last pope to appear in his chronicles. On 22 June 1278, [[Pope Nicholas III]], while in [[Viterbo]], appointed him [[Archbishop of Gniezno]].

While en route to his new [[episcopal see]], Martin died in [[Bologna]], where he was buried at the [[Basilica of San Domenico|Basilica of St. Dominic]], near the tomb of the founder of his Order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel de La Roche]]: ''Memoirs of Literature: Containing a Large Account of Many Valuable Books'' ... , 1722 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CcIOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA386&amp;dq=%2Bmartinus+%2B1278+%2Bchronicle&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Martin's Latin chronicle, the ''Chronicon pontificum et imperatorum'', was intended for the school-room. It is mostly derivative in content and is therefore of limited value to modern historians. However, its importance is in the way the material is presented, which is a quantum leap forward in didactic method. The genius lies in its layout; each double page covers fifty years with fifty lines per page. The left-hand pages give the history of the [[papacy]], with one line per year, and the right-hand pages give the history of [[emperor]]s, the two accounts being kept strictly parallel. This was a revolutionary approach in [[graphic design]], which was not appreciated by all his contemporaries: many manuscripts simply copy the text without retaining the page layout, which results in a rather chaotic chronology. The chronicle was enormously influential; over 400 manuscripts are known, and the influence on many dozens of later chroniclers is palpable. Translations were made into many medieval vernaculars, including Middle English, as well as an Old French translation by Sébastien Mamerot. Martin's ''Chronicon'' is the most influential source for the legend of "[[Pope Joan]]". Other of his works include the ''Promptuarium Exemplorum''.

'''Max Kohnstamm''' (22 May 1914 – 20 October 2010) was a Dutch historian and diplomat.

Max Kohnstamm was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands, the son of [[Philip Kohnstamm]], a physicist, philosopher and pedagogue of Jewish-German origin. His father was married to one of the daughters of [[Jean Baptiste August Kessler]], who helped create the company now known as [[Royal Dutch Shell]]; one of his uncles was [[Geldolph Adriaan Kessler]], who helped create the Dutch steel industry. During World War II, Kohnstamm and Kessler were both held hostage by the Germans along with other prominent Dutchmen at camp [[Gymnasium Beekvliet|Beekvliet]] in [[Sint-Michielsgestel]]; they became quite close there despite the difference in age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Clercq|2010|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the founding fathers of the European Union and played a major part in the 1950s in the development European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and then of the European Economic Communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/18/max-kohnstamm-obituary|title=Max Kohnstamm obituary|first=John|last=Palmer|date=18 November 2010|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at [[University of Amsterdam|Amsterdam University]], where he studied Modern History, before taking up a fellowship at [[American University]], [[Washington, D.C.]]. During 1938 and 1939 he travelled through the United States as part of his studies. His correspondence with his father during this period discussed his impressions of the United States and his concerns with the looming war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kohnstamm | first = Dolph (Editor) | title = Still No War: Correspondence Between Two Dutchmen - son Max and father, Philip Kohnstamm | publisher = Athena Press | year = 2003 | location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was private secretary to [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] from 1945 to 1948, then served with the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)|Netherlands Foreign Office]] from 1948 to 1952.  During this time he was head of its German Bureau and Director of European Affairs.  He was Vice President of the Netherlands' [[Schuman Declaration|Schuman Plan]] delegation in 1950, serving as Secretary to the [[High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community]] from 1952 to 1956.  He was Vice President of the Action Committee for the United States of Europe from 1956.  He was President of the [[European University Institute]] in [[Florence]].  He was Chairman of the [[Trilateral Commission]] in Europe.

He was a member of the [[Club of Rome]] global think-tank, being one of the six member "inner group" at the time its influential work the ''Limits to Growth'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Mediology''' (French: ''médiologie''), broadly indicates a wide-ranging method for the analysis of [[cultural transmission]] in society and across societies, a method which challenges the conventional idea that 'technology is not culture'. The mediological method pays specific attention to the role of organisations and technical innovations, and the ways in which these can ensure the potency of cultural transmission - and thus the transformation of ideas into a civilisational worldview capable of sustained action.

==Overview==
The term was first coined and introduced in French as "médiologie" by the French intellectual [[Régis Debray]] in the "Teachers, Writers, Celebrities" section of his book ''Le pouvoir intellectuel en France'', (Editions Ramsay, 1979). The English form of the term became more widely known and respected in the English-speaking world with the publication of the key text on mediology in English, Debray's ''Transmitting Culture'' (University of Columbia Press, 2004). Mediology was taught for the first time in the Sorbonne (Paris) in 2007.

The practice of mediology is not a science, and thus is able to range across academic disciplines. The main areas involved are those of longitudinal history (the history of technologies, the history of the book, the histories and theories of aesthetics) and also research in communications and information theory.

Mediology is not a narrow specialist area of contemporary academic knowledge (as [[media sociology]] is), nor does it aspire to be a precise science of signs (as [[semiotics]] does). It differs from the models put forward by [[communication studies]], in that its focus is not isolated individuals and a fleeting few moments of communication. Instead mediologists study the cultural transmission of [[religion]]s, ideologies, the arts and political ideas in society, and across societies, over a time period that is usually to be measured in months, decades or millennia. Debray argues that mediology "would like to bring to light the function of [[Media (communication)|medium]] in all its forms, over a long time span - since the birth of writing. And without becoming obsessed by today's media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1999/08/DEBRAY/12314|title=Qu'est-ce que la médiologie ?, par Régis Debray (Le Monde diplomatique, août 1999)|publisher=Monde-diplomatique.fr|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mediology must thus closely examine the methods used for the memorising, transmission, and displacement of cultural knowledge in any [[milieu]]. But it must balance its understanding of these with an equally close study of our individual modes of belief, thoughts, and competing social organisations. Mediology must further understand that such transmission is not simply happening within a lofty [[linguistic]] or textual discourse, but that transmission takes an equally valid concrete form in which "material technologies and symbolic forms"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1999/08/DEBRAY/12314|title=Qu'est-ce que la médiologie ?, par Régis Debray (Le Monde diplomatique, août 1999)|publisher=Monde-diplomatique.fr|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; combine to produce things such as [[rituals]], [[architecture]], [[flags]], special sites, customs, [[typefaces]] and [[book binding]]s, smells and sounds, [[body language|bodily gestures and postures]], all of which have a potent anchoring role in cultural transmission among ordinary people.

Debray further points to the need to consider the role in transmission of all manner of non-media technical-cultural inventions, especially those of new forms of transportation. He gives the historical example of the [[bicycle]], which he suggests was historically associated with: the rise of a democratic rational individualism; a new role for women in advanced societies; and the new kinetic ideas expressed in early [[modernist]] art and cinema.

A mediologist might thus make an examination "within a system" (e.g. of systems of book production, of authors and publishers), or of "the interaction between systems" (e.g. how [[painting]] and [[early photography]] influenced each other), or even of "the interactions across systems" (e.g. the ways in which symbolic transmission of systematic knowledge is brought to intersect with the material history of actual transportation - such as desert trading routes and ancient religion, [[telegraph]] and railroad, the radio and airplanes, television and satellites, mobile phones and cars).

Debray is generally critical of some of the ideas of [[Marshall McLuhan]] (whom he sees as being overly [[Technological determinism|technologically determinist]]), and of the French [[sociologist]] [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. He also tries to step beyond [[Antonio Gramsci]], in that he suggests that an ideology cannot be comprehended in ideological terms alone.

==Criticisms==
Criticisms of mediology in English so far have been found in two short book reviews and one article.  The first, by the screenwriter [[Yvette Biro|Yvette Bíró]] (''Wide Angle'' magazine, Vol.18, No.1, January 1996), was a four-page book review of Debray's ''Vie et Mort de l'Image'', in which she claimed to have discerned "traces of a strong, vulgar [[Marxist]] school of thought".

The second review, by [[Pramod Nayor]] of the University of Hyderabad (''Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory'', Vol.8, No.1, Winter 2006) was a review of the English translation of ''Transmitting Culture'' (2004).  In concluding the review Nayor notes the similarities of some aspects and directions of mediology to [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies|Birmingham School cultural studies]] ranging from "[[Raymond Williams]] through [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]". Nayor also notes that recent philosophers and historians of science - he cites [[Bruno Latour]], [[Eugene Thacker]] and [[Dwight Atkinson]] - have also examined science in relation to "intersecting cultural, ethnic, economic and iconographic 'bases' of the transmission of culture"

An article by Steven Maris in ''Fibreculture'' No.12 [http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue12/issue12_maras.html] similarly suggests that Debray is too firmly embedded in "the French academic scene" and that thus "Debray's explicit engagement with other national scholarly traditions of media, communications and cultural studies in the works mentioned above is minimal". Maris also notes that mediology "predates much of the [current academic] interest in networked cultures and new media".

Physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] have criticized Debray's work for using [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]] as a metaphor without understanding its basic ideas, in their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]''. Debray engaged in dialogue with Bricmont in a 2003 book titled "À l'ombre des lumières : Débat entre un philosophe et un scientifique", which so far has not been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alencon.fr/alencon/Main;jsessionid=DCNAOEIEBKEB?ISUM_ID=center&amp;ISUM_SCR=nwExternalServiceScr&amp;ISUM_CIPH=T9aJnOHAgwQV8T2hIQ5D3Du3v4I5zbXVbG3CxvkJy7s_&amp;ISUM_URL=rtE--JVQ7nRU10QjZURxmHAxjLLIW3DXPzmc29-XDq1dc8FTO2YT0563J3xcF8aK |accessdate=August 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816160928/http://www.alencon.fr/alencon/Main |archivedate=August 16, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such criticisms, the six-volume ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' (2004) wrote of Debray that "His achievement is to have synthesized these earlier arguments into a practice with a powerful political project ahead of it." (Vol.4, page 1394).

'''Michelle Murphy''' (born 1969)&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt; is a Canadian [[academic]]. She is a Professor of History and Women and Gender Studies at the [[University of Toronto]] and Director of the Technoscience Research Unit.&lt;ref name="UofT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Michelle Murphy|url=http://history.utoronto.ca/michelle-murphy|website=University of Toronto|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy is well known for her work on regimes of imperceptibility, the ways in which different forms of knowledge become visible or invisible in the scientific community and broader society. Murphy has published several books, including ''Sick Building Syndrome and the Problem of Uncertainty: Environmental Politics, Technoscience, and Women Workers'' (2006) which won the [[Ludwik Fleck Prize]] from the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]],&lt;ref name="FISCHER"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleck"/&gt; ''Seizing the Means of Reproduction: Entanglements of Feminism, Health, and Technoscience'' (2012), and ''The Economization of Life'' (2017).

==Early life and education==
Claudette Michelle Murphy was born in 1969&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt; and grew up in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]. Her family background includes [[Métis|Metis]]&lt;ref name="Modell"/&gt; and [[French people|French]] heritage.&lt;ref name="Technopolitics"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Michelle|title=Michelle Murphy|url=https://technopolitics.wordpress.com/|website=Technopolitics Blog|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy was inspired by the work of feminists in science in the mid-eighties, including [[Donna Haraway]] and [[Ruth Hubbard]].&lt;ref name="Modell"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Modell|first1=Amanda|title=Feminists in Science and Science Studies, Profile: Michelle Murphy|url=http://fri.ucdavis.edu/news/2016/profile-michelle-murphy.html|website=The Feminist Research Institute, UC Davis|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned a bachelor's degree in Biology and History and Philosophy of Science and Technology from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1992. She earned a Ph.D. from [[Harvard University]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="CSUS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Michelle Murphy  Professor, Department of History and Women and Gender Studies Institute Affiliated Faculty, CSUS|url=http://munkschool.utoronto.ca/profile/murphy-michelle/|website=Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her experience at Harvard led her to incorporate analysis of whiteness explicitly into her work on science.&lt;ref name="Modell"/&gt;

In the 1990s, Murphy worked with [[Evelyn Hammond]] and her working group on race and science at [[MIT]]. From 1996-2007, she edited RaceSci, a website on anti-racist studies in science, medicine, and technology. With Adele Clarke and others at the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]], she organized panels on race and science.&lt;ref name="Modell"/&gt;

==Career==

Murphy is interested in asking the question "What can feminist technoscience be?"&lt;ref name="Modell"/&gt; She studies the recent history of science and technology with particular attention to [[economics]], [[capitalism]], the [[Natural environment|environment]], and [[Sexual reproduction|reproduction]], with an awareness of [[colonialism]], [[feminism]], [[gender]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and [[queer theory]].&lt;ref name="Modell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Aryn|last2=Myers|first2=Natasha|last3=Viseu|first3=Ana|title=The politics of care in technoscience|journal=Social Studies of Science|date=September 28, 2015|volume=45|issue=5|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0306312715602073|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She focuses on [[Canada]],&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=Michelle|title=Distributed Reproduction, Chemical Violence, and Latency|journal=S&amp;F Online|date=Summer 2013|volume=11|issue=3|url=http://sfonline.barnard.edu/life-un-ltd-feminism-bioscience-race/distributed-reproduction-chemical-violence-and-latency/|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MurphyEH"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=Michelle|title=Chemical Regimes of Living|journal=Environmental History|date=October 2008|volume=13|issue=4|pages=695–703|jstor=25473297}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States]], [[Bangladesh]], and issues around [[Toxicity|chemical exposure]], [[environmental justice]], and [[reproductive justice]].&lt;ref name="Modell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevens|first1=Lindsay M.|title=Environmental Contaminants and Reproductive Bodies|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|date=December 2016|volume=57|issue=4|pages=471–485|doi=10.1177/0022146516671569|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022146516671569|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Landscapes of Exposure: Knowledge and Illness in Modern Environments'', which she co-edited with Gregg Mitman and Chris Sellers in 2004, has been called  "a foundational volume in bringing historical and social science perspectives to bear on the intersection of place and disease."&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Benjamin|title=Sick Building Syndrome and the Problem of Uncertainty: Author Michelle Murphy Discusses|url=http://scienceblogs.com/worldsfair/2008/09/08/sick-building-syndrome-and-the/|website=Science Blogs|accessdate=September 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy is known for the concept of[regimes of imperceptibility, a framework for examining the ways in which different forms of knowledge become visible or invisible within scientific communities and society.&lt;ref name="Cloatre"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cloatre|first1=Emilie|last2=Pickersgill|first2=Martyn|title=Knowledge, technology and law : at the intersection of socio-legal and science &amp; technology studies|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=9780415628624|pages=191–193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xiiDBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... by analyzing "regimes of perceptibility", she reveals how the politics of knowledge production and the process of materialization involve obscuring awareness of certain things in order to make others more pronounced, known, and thus controllable.... Murphy demonstrates how the power-laden raced/classed/gendered regimes of perceptibility also create "domains of imperceptibility" that may be acted upon as an inventive space.&lt;ref name="Garrison"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garrison|first1=Laura|title=Human Capital and its Maximization Knowledge, Resistance and Labor|url=https://anthrobiopolitics.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/knowledge-resistance-and-labor/|website=The Anthropology of Biopolitics A blog about Knowledge, Power, and the Individual in Society Today|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She develops these ideas in ''Sick Building Syndrome and the Problem of Uncertainty: Environmental Politics, Technoscience, and Women Workers'' (2006). She traces the history of [[sick building syndrome]] (SBS), a diagnosis applied to mass health complaints by office workers for which no cause can be identified.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;  She closely examines the ways in which the identification of a new disease was affected by "a congeries of unlikely forces" including both scientific and social factors.&lt;ref name="Isenberg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Isenberg|first1=Andrew C.|title=The Oxford handbook of environmental history|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195324907|page=91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=26xOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identification and acceptance of SBS, an inherently uncertain diagnosis, involves gender, race, and power dynamics within "normal science."&lt;ref name="Garrison"/&gt; This raises the question "How do we come to presence the effects of capitalism in our lives, and how are those effects invisibilized?"&lt;ref name="Modell"/&gt;  She also looks at the presentation of information in ways that drew on traditions from the labor and feminist movements.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; The framework she introduces can be used by anthropological researchers for complex biopolitical analysis.&lt;ref name="Garrison"/&gt; She received the [[Ludwik Fleck Prize]] (2008) from the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]] for this book.&lt;ref name="FISCHER"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleck"/&gt;

Murphy is also the author of ''Seizing the Means of Reproduction: Entanglements of Feminism, Health, and Technoscience'' (2012). Her starting point is the work of radical feminists in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, who advocated for alternative health techniques and [[Feminist health centers|feminist clinics]]. She goes on to place these developments in a broader framework, examining relationships between feminism, [[imperialism]], capitalism, [[population control]], and [[neoliberalism]].&lt;ref name="Sethna"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sethna|first1=C.|title=Michelle Murphy, Seizing the Means of Reproduction: Entanglements of Feminism, Health, and Technoscience|journal=Social History of Medicine|date=22 May 2014|volume=27|issue=3|pages=609–610|doi=10.1093/shm/hku022|url=http://shm.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/05/21/shm.hku022|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is applauded for identifying critical junctures that were previously overlooked, and for its elegant examination of how the "economy of reproduction" operates in both developed and developing worlds.&lt;ref name="Tunc"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tunc|first1=Tanfer Emin|title=Seizing the Means of Reproduction: Entanglements of Feminism, Health, and Technoscience by Michelle Murphy|journal=American Studies|date=2014|volume=53|issue=1|pages=248–249|doi=10.1353/ams.2014.0024|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/545763|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy has said:

{{quote|sign=|source=|I've been really interested in reproductive justice as you might normally think of it in terms of questions of reproductive health, birth, family planning, and population control, but I've also been very interested in asking the question, "Why do we think we know what reproduction is? Why do we think we know where it begins and ends?" In fact there's a wonderful rich world of thinking about the relations of reproduction, in which the idea that reproduction happens in your body is actually quite new. The idea of reproduction as confined to the body dates to the 1980s. Before that reproduction was always something that happened in the aggregate or the relation.&lt;ref name="Modell"/&gt;}}

Murphy continues to work on "Distributed Reproduction," a theorization of reproduction that would extend beyond the individual.&lt;ref name="UofT"/&gt;

Her book ''The Economization of Life'' (2017) explores the 20th century rise of techniques to value life based on economic and biopolitical concerns. Murphy examines the techniques and epistemologies that have been used to describe and connect ideas of populations and economics in the United States and Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="Duke2017"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Economization of Life Michelle Murphy|journal=Books and Journals, Spring 2017 |publisher=Duke University Press|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/pr/dup_cat_1478714087_DUP_S17cat.pdf|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy is also working on "Alterlife in the Ongoing Aftermaths of Industrial Chemicals," an examination of the transgenerational effects of environmental damage from industrial chemicals in the [[Great Lakes region]].&lt;ref name="UofT"/&gt;

'''Neill Lochery''' (born 1965) is a Scottish author and leading historian on the modern history of Europe and the Mediterranean Middle East.  He is a frequent contributor to newspapers and journal publications around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Neill Lochery, list of published journalism and journal articles: http://www.neill-lochery.co.uk/journalism.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Lochery is Professor of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean Studies at [[University College London]].

== Author ==
He is the author of a series of critically acclaimed books. A number of his latest books focus on World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wilson, Wall Street Journal – review of Lisbon, War in the Shadows of the City of Light - https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204531404577052460171553838&lt;/ref&gt;

His international bestseller, ''Lisbon: War in the Shadows in the City of Light, 1939-1945'', recounts the pivotal role the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, played during World War II and how the small European country, guided by its authoritarian leader, [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], survived the war not only physically intact but also significantly wealthier. The book is set within the context of a country that was frantically trying to hold on to its self-proclaimed wartime neutrality, but it was increasingly caught in the middle of the economic, and naval, wars between the Allies and the Axis.

In ''Brazil: The Fortunes of War, World War II and the Making of Modern Brazil'', Lochery reveals a long-buried chapter of World War II, showing how the cunning statecraft and [[economic opportunism]] of Brazil's leaders, under the dictatorship of [[Getúlio Vargas]], transformed it into a regional superpower and uncovers the little-known origins of one of the world’s emerging economic powerhouses.
In 2013, he completed the first volume of a major work on the modern history of Portugal; ''Outside Looking In, 1933-1974''. It tells the stories of the colourful array of international personalities who came to Lisbon during the one of the most controversial periods in its modern history, the period of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portuguese Estado Novo]]. In his book ''Out of the Shadows'', Neill Lochery provides an engaging and insightful account of Portugal's first 40 years of democracy that started from the Carnation Revolution in 1974.

Lochery has additionally produced a series of books on the Middle East: ''The Resistible Rise of [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'' (2016), ''Loaded Dice'' (2007), ''The View from the Fence'' (2005), ''Why Blame Israel'' (2004), ''The Difficult Road to Peace'' (1999) and ''The Israeli Labour Party'' (1997).

[[Image:Nikolay Danilevski.jpg|right|thumb|Nikolay Yakovlevich Danilevsky]]
'''Nikolay Yakovlevich Danilevsky''' ({{lang-ru|Никола́й Я́ковлевич Даниле́вский}}; 28 November 1822 – 7 November 1885) was a Russian Empire [[natural history|naturalist]], [[economics|economist]], [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[history|historian]] and ideologue of [[Pan-Slavism]] and the [[Slavophile]] movement. He expounded a [[eternal return|circular]] view of world history.

He is remembered also for his opposition to [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] and for his theory of historical-cultural types.

==Life==
Danilevsky was born in the village of [[Izmalkovsky District|Oberets]] in [[Oryol Governorate]].  As a member of a noble family, he was educated at the [[Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum]]. After graduation, he went on to an appointment with the Military Ministry Office. Dissatisfied with the prospect of a military career, he began to attend the [[University of St Petersburg]], where he studied [[physics]] and [[mathematics]].

Having passed his master's exams, Danilevsky prepared to defend his thesis on the flora of the [[Black Sea]] area of [[Europe]]an Russia but in 1849 he was arrested there for his membership in the [[Petrashevsky Circle]], which studied the work of French [[socialism|socialists]] and included [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]. Its most active members were sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment. Danilevsky was imprisoned for 100 days in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] and then was sent to live under police surveillance in [[Vologda]], where he worked in provincial administration.

In 1852, he was appointed to an expedition, led by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]], to assess the condition of the fishing industry on the [[Volga]] and the [[Caspian Sea]]. The expedition lasted four years, and Danilevsky was then reassigned to the Agricultural Department of the State Property Ministry. For over 20 years, he was responsible for expeditions to the [[White Sea]], the Black Sea, the [[Azov Sea]], the Caspian Sea and the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The expertise that he gained from the expeditions led to the publication of his 1872 book, ''Examination of Fishery Conditions in Russia''.

Aside from his work on fisheries and the seal trade, he was the head of the commission setting the rules for the use of running water in [[Crimea]] from 1872 to 1879. He ran the [[Nikitsky Botanical Gardens]] from 1879 to 1880, and he was part of a commission appointed to deal with the [[phylloxera]] epidemic in the 1880s. His papers on Russian [[climatology]], [[geology]], [[geography]], and [[ethnology]] earned him a gold medal from the [[Russian Geographical Society]].

Danilevsky died in [[Tbilisi]], [[Tiflis Governorate]], and was buried at his estate, in Mshanka.

==Work==
=== Natural theology and rejection of Darwinism===
Danilevsky's ''Darwinism: Critical research,'' which brings together more than 1200 pages of arguments against Darwin's theory, mostly assembled from the literature that already existed at the time, was published in 1885. It was meant to be the first volume of a longer work, the second volume containing Danilevsky's own theories, which he characterised as "[[natural theology]]", but it was unfinished at his death. When it was published posthumously, it contained only preliminary studies.

Danilevsky had been influenced by the work of von Baer, who had developed his own [[Teleology|teleological]] theory of evolution and gone on to criticise Darwin's work in the 1870s. Danilevsky took from von Baer's theory the notion of ''[[Zielstrebigkeit]]''. The [[German language|German]] word means "singleness of purpose" but Danilevsky imbued it with a religious aspect and argued that evolution, as well as the original creation of the world, has a rational purpose and follows the will of a divine creator.

===Theory of historical-cultural types===
Danilevsky first published ''Russia and Europe: A Look at the Cultural and Political Relations of the Slavic World to the Romano-German World'' in the journal ''[[Zarya]]'' in 1869. Later republished as a [[monograph]], it brought him international fame.

He pioneered the use of biological and morphological metaphors in the comparison of cultures. Danilevsky compared cultures and nations to biological species, denied their commonality and argued that each nation or civilisation is united by its language and culture, which it cannot pass on to any other nation. He thus characterised [[Peter the Great]]'s reforms in Russia as doomed to failure, as they had attempted to impose alien values on the Slavic world.

Danilevsky distinguished four categories of historical-cultural activity:

# religious
# political
# sociopolitical
# cultural

They gave rise to ten historical-cultural types:&lt;ref&gt;

Арийская группа языков подразделяется, как известно, на семь главных лингвистических семейств: санскритское, иранское, эллинское, латинское, кельтическое, германское и славянское. Из племен, соответствующих этим семи семействам языков, пять - индийское, персидское, греческое, римское, или древнеиталийское, и германское - представляли или представляют самобытные культурно-исторические типы, развившиеся в самобытные цивилизации.[...] Вне семитических и арийских племен, два другие самобытные племени, хамитское, или египетское, и китайское, тоже образовали своеобразные культурно-исторические типы.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

# Chaldean
# Hebrew
# Arab
# Indian
# Persian
# Greek
# Roman or ancient Italian
# Germanic
# Hamitic or Egyptian
# Chinese

Danilevsky applied his teleological theory of evolution by stating that each type went through various predetermined stages of youth, adulthood, and old age, the last being the end of that type. He characterised the Slavic type as being at the youth stage, and he developed a socio-political plan for its development, involving unification of the Slavic world, with its future capital at [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]), ruled by an Orthodox emperor. While other cultures would degenerate in their blind struggle for existence, the Slavic world should be viewed as a [[Messiah]] among them. Danilevsky, however, believed that there is no genuine or absolute progress, as history is circular.

Aspects of Danilevsky's book prefigured some of the theories in [[Oswald Spengler]]'s ''[[The Decline of the West]]''. [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] mentions them in ''[[A Study of History]]''. The Danilevsky hypothesis became the subject of much controversy and polarised its readers. On one hand, [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] praised it, but on the other hand, [[Westernizer|Occidentalist]]s, such as [[Nikolai Kareev]], [[Pavel Milyukov]] (1859-1943) and [[Nikolai Mikhailovsky]] (1842-1904), strongly opposed it.

An '''Oil sketch''' or '''oil study''' is an artwork made primarily in [[oil paint]] in preparation for a larger, finished work. Originally these were created as preparatory studies or '''[[modello|modelli]]''', especially so as to gain approval for the design of a larger commissioned painting. They were also used as designs for specialists in other media, such as [[printmaking]] or [[tapestry]], to follow. Later they were produced as independent works, often with no thought of being expanded into a full-size painting.

The [[sketch (drawing)|usual medium]] for ''modelli'' was the [[drawing]], but an oil sketch, even if done in a limited range of colours, could better suggest the tone of the projected work. It is also possible to more fully convey the flow and energy of a composition in paint. For a painter with exceptional technique, the production of an oil sketch may be as rapid as that of a drawing, and many practitioners had superb brush skills. In its rapidity of execution the oil sketch may be used not only to express movement and transient effects of light and color, its gestural nature may even represent a mimetic parallel to the action of the subject.

One of the earliest artists to produce oil sketches was [[Polidoro da Caravaggio]], a fine draftsman and pupil of [[Raphael]], but not one who had passed through the traditional Florentine training, with its emphasis on drawing.  His are all apparently related to works later done on a larger scale, and are themselves relatively large and on [[panel painting|panel]], with examples in the [[National Gallery, London]][https://web.archive.org/web/20070303121519/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG6594] and [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] being 75 and 65&amp;nbsp;cm tall respectively.  Sometimes a number of sketches for the same composition have survived.
[[Image:Théodore Géricault nu masculino.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Oil study of a male nude by [[Géricault]]]]
In the early 17th century the oil sketch became widely used, as it was suited to conveying the drama of [[Baroque painting|Baroque art]].  [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] made great use of them, as working studies, and as ''modelli'' for clients, his own assistants, engravers and tapestry-makers.  Their degree of finish varies accordingly.  Rubens' working practices influenced others, such as [[Anthony van Dyck]], who did not normally use oil sketches for the portraits that were the bulk of his output, but did for his [[old master print|print]] series the ''Iconographie'', and for other works such as a projected series of tapestries and some religious paintings. The ''[[Magistrate of Brussels]]'', recognised in England in 2013, may be a Van Dyck portrait oil sketch. 

Perhaps the first to produce oil sketches as independent works was [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], an amazingly fecund generator of compositions on a relatively small range of subjects.  He grew up and trained in [[Genoa]], and apparently had contact with both Rubens and Van Dyck during their stays there.  He produced a large number of small works, mostly on paper, in a mixture of mediums - drawings or [[gouache]]s finished in oil, oils with pen details - in fact, most possible permutations.  Detail is typically restricted to a few key points, with much of the subject conveyed in impressionistic fashion.  By this time a collectors' market for studies in drawing was well developed, and there was appreciation of their energy and freedom. Castiglione's sketches to some extent seem to trade off this appreciation, and look more unfinished and offhand than they actually are - a concept with a great future. 

A systematic producer of small ''modelli'' sketches on canvas with a high degree of finish was the 18th century [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], whose superb technique is often shown at its best in reducing a huge [[altarpiece]] to a lively but precise rendering at this small scale. At roughly the same time [[Jean Fragonard]] was producing a series of virtuosic ''Figures de fantaisie'', half-length portraits of imaginary subjects, purporting to have been painted in an hour.&lt;ref&gt;Brettell, Richard R.: ''Impression: Painting Quickly in France'', pages 31–2. Yale University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:John Constable 025.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[John Constable]], 1827, 22 × 31 cm]]

By the 19th century oil sketches, often referred to as "oil studies" if from this period, had become very common, both as preparatory works, and for their own sake. The popularity of the oil sketch engendered the need to formulate distinctions. The ''esquisse'', or oil sketch, tended to be inspirational or imaginative, often originating in literature or art; the ''etude'', or study, tended to represent an observation of nature, painted from life. In academic painting the oil sketch took the form of the ''croquis'', a small and gestural compositional study, and the ''ébauche'', a dynamic laying-in of paint on the full-scale canvas, a temporary stage of the painting eventually leading to greater elaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Brettell, pages 31–9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[John Constable]] made extensive use of sketches for his landscapes, both of intimate scale, often in a [[sketchbook]] on paper, and in full-scale sketches for his largest "six-footers", which he used to refine his compositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/constable/ Tate Britain exhibition showing Constable's large landscapes along with their full-size oil sketches]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:Composition study for the portrait of professor gross thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Eakins]], Sketch for [[The Gross Clinic]].]][[image:Study for swimming thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|left|Thomas Eakins, 1884 ''Swimming Hole sketch'', [[oil paint|oil]] on [[fiberboard]] mounted on fiberboard, 22.1 × 27 cm., 8{{fraction|3|4}} × 10{{fraction|3|4}} inches, [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], [[Washington, D.C..]]]][[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Géricault]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] and [[Degas]] are other artists who often used them. For some oil sketches Degas painted in ''essence'', a technique by which the oil had been all but removed from the pigment, so that the artist was virtually drawing with pure paint. [[Seurat]] made many careful small oil sketches for his larger works. However, with the advent of [[Impressionism]], and then [[Modernism]], the practice of preparatory drawing and painting tended to decline. The abandonment by many artists of a high level of detail and finish in favor of a more [[painterly]] and spontaneous approach, reduced the distinction between a detailed sketch and a finished painting.  Sketches by Rubens or Tiepolo, for example, are at least as highly finished as many 20th century oil paintings.  Many artists, especially those working in more traditional styles, still use oil sketches today.  [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] is an example of an artist who called many of his most important, and largest, finished works "studies": examples are his [[Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion]] [[Tate Britain]], or his ''Study from Pope Innocent X'', auctioned in 2007 for $52.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0516/baconf.html RTE story &amp; picture]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Olaus Schmidt (1865 - 1969) (23776173442).jpg|thumb|Portrait of Olaus Dons Schmidt]]

'''Olaus Dons Schmidt''' (8 November 1895 – 28 April 1969) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] genealogist.

He was born in [[Trondheim|Trondhjem]] as a son of trader Johan Christian Ludvig Schmidt (1850–1919) and Inga Cecilie Broström (1858–1919). In 1925 he married engineer's daughter Hildur Synnøve Strøm from [[Hamar]].&lt;ref name=hvem&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1948|title=Schmidt, Olaus Dons|encyclopedia=[[Hvem er hvem?]]|editor=Steenstrup, Bjørn|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|url=http://runeberg.org/hvemerhvem/1948/0468.html|pages=468|language=Norwegian|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took middle school, started training in the postal service in 1913 and spent his entire career as a postal clerk in Trondhjem. On the side, however, he was a productive genealogical and historical writer. His main genealogical work was ''Familien Schive'' in 1917. He contributed extensively to the journals ''Slektshistorisk Tidsskrift'' and ''Personalhistorisk Tidsskrift'' and to the [[biographical dictionary]] ''[[Norsk Biografisk Leksikon]]''. From 1944 he was a fellow of the [[Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters]].&lt;ref name=hvem/&gt; He also wrote tens of historical books on companies and institutions in the Trondhjem region, beginning with the 100-year-history of Trondhjem Stock Exchange in 1919 and ending with some posthumous releases where other authors built upon his work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ask.bibsys.no/ask/action/result?cql=forfatter+%3D+%22schmidt%2C+olaus%22&amp;aktivKilde=biblio&amp;sortering=sortdate-&amp;treffPrSide=50&amp;side=1&amp;kilde=biblio List of publications] in [[BIBSYS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He chaired the Trondhjems Historical Association and the gentlemen's club [[Klubbselskapet Harmonien]], and was a board member of [[Selskabet for Trondhjems Bys Vel]].&lt;ref name=hvem/&gt; He died in April 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1973|title=Fortegnelse over personer som siste gang er omtalt i utgaven 1968 med angivelse av deres dødsdatum|encyclopedia=[[Hvem er hvem?]]|editor=Steenstrup, Bjørn|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|url=http://runeberg.org/hvemerhvem/1973/0630.html|page=630|language=Norwegian|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Kenneth Baillie Reynolds''', [[CBE]] (1896 – 1973) was a British classical scholar and archaeologist who studied specialised Roman troops such as the ''[[frumentarii]]'' and the ''[[vigiles]]''.

He was the son of Louis Baillie Reynolds, a stockbroker, and novelist [[Gertrude Minnie Robins]]. He studied at [[Hertford College]], Oxford between 1915–1919, his studies being interrupted by World War I. He served in the [[Royal Artillery]].&lt;ref name=kanovium&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |title=The Excavations on the Site of The Roman Fort Kanovium at Caerhun 1926-9 By P.K Baillie Reynolds OBE, CBE. |work=KANOVIUM PROJECT | url=http://www.betws31.freeserve.co.uk/Bath-house/Caerhun_Excavation_/caerhun_excavation_.html | accessdate= 6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1921, he had become a [[Pelham student]] at the [[British School in Rome]]. While Rome he wrote books and articles for which he is well remembered (e.g., ''The Troops Quartered in the Castra Peregrina'' JRS 13 1923, pages 168–87; ''The Vigiles of Imperial Rome'', Oxford 1926). Baillie Reynolds extensively researched the remains of ancient Rome's aqueducts. He stayed at Rome until 1923.&lt;ref name=kanovium /&gt;

In 1924, Baillie Reynolds became a lecturer on Ancient history at [[Aberystwyth University]]. While at Aberystwyth, he also directed the excavations of [[Canovium|Kanovium]], the Roman fort at [[Caerhun]], North Wales, over a period of four summers from 1926. He published a series of reports on these excavations in [[Archaeologia Cambrensis]], which were published as a collection in 1938; they are considered a classic study of their type. At this time he also published numerous books and reports on archaeological sites in Britain and beyond. He is best known for his book, "The Vigiles of Imperial Rome" (1926). In 1934 he became an [[Inspector of Ancient Monuments]], England, and Chief Inspector from 1954 to 1961. As an Inspector, he wrote guide books for some of the many sites under Government care, some of which remained in print for over twenty years (e.g., "[[Chysauster]]" Cornwall, HMSO Guides, London 1960).&lt;ref name=kanovium /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last=| first=| title=Read a book Visit a Museum: Kanovium Project Book Reviews| url=http://www.betws31.freeserve.co.uk/Books_about_Caerhun_Fort/books_about_caerhun_fort.html| accessdate=28 October 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511214942/http://www.betws31.freeserve.co.uk/Books_about_Caerhun_Fort/books_about_caerhun_fort.html| archivedate=11 May 2008| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last significant task was to oversee repairs to the [[Aqua Claudia]] aqueduct in Rome, which ran through the grounds of the British Embassy. A report of this work was published in the journal [[Archaeologia (London)|Archaeologia]] Volume 100, 1966. It was his last publication, and he died in 1973.&lt;ref name=kanovium /&gt;

Baillie Reynolds had a distinguished career, recognised by his honours, firstly becoming an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] and subsequently made a Commander of the Order.&lt;ref name=kanovium /&gt;

During World War II, Baillie-Reynolds was one of the founding members of the [[Monuments Men]] (M.F.A.A.), who sought to protect European art treasures during and after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= | first=  | title=The Monuments Men | url=http://www.monumentsmen.com/the-monuments-men/monuments-men-roster | accessdate=6 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pak Noja''' (born '''Vladimir Tikhonov''' on February 5,&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.nec.go.kr/electioninfo/candidate_detail_basicInfo.xhtml?electionId=0020120411&amp;huboId=100102891 중앙선거관리위원회 선거통계시스템|후보자상세정보|기본정보]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1973) is a [[Russia]]n-born [[South Korea]]n academic of [[Korean studies]], and columnist.

==Biography==
Pak Noja was born to a Jewish family in [[Leningrad]], [[Soviet Union]]. His Russian name is Vladimir Tikhonov ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Владимир Тихонов),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=1999111919000301 |script-title=ko:제2회 한중일 천태학술대회 外 |publisher=Munhwa.com |date=1999-11-19 |language=Korean |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after immigrating to South Korea in 1997, he changed his name into a Korean name, Pak Noja and became naturalized as a South Korean citizen in 2001.&lt;ref name="newscham" /&gt;
 
Fascinated by Korean movies and classical literature during his high school days, he decided to study Korean history.&lt;ref name="newscham" /&gt; In his 16th year, he entered the department of Korean studies at St. Petersburg National University of Russia, and he made his first visit to Korea as an exchange student in 1991 and stayed in Seoul for about 3 months.&lt;ref name="newscham" /&gt;

After his bachelor's degree, Pak kept studying Korean history and was granted a doctorate from [[Moscow State University]] with his thesis about [[Gaya Confederacy|Gaya]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=1999010220000801 |script-title=ko:옛 소련 사학자가 쓴 ‘…고대불교사’ 譯刊 |publisher=Munhwa.com |date=1999-01-02 |language=Korean |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; a combination of city states which lasted until the 6th century in southern part of Korea.
 
While working on his degree, in 1992, Pak met a Korean violinist, Paik Myong-jong (백명정, 1971- ) who was at that time studying at the Leningrad University of Russia; they married in 1995.
 
Pak worked on translating Korean literature into Russian and wrote several liberal arts and sociology books about Korean culture and politics, including his best-selling book, ‘your Korea (당신들의 대한민국)’. His writings made him known as one of Korea’s influential progressive intellectuals, and brought on many controversial issues within Korea by sharp criticism.&lt;ref name="sisa-issue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sisa-issue.inews24.com/php/news_view.php?g_menu=050500&amp;g_serial=91264|date=2003-05-21|publisher=Sisa-issue.inews24.com|language=Korean|script-title=ko:(온라인 인기 도서) 5월 둘째주(종합, 비즈니스와 경제)|accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pak has taught Russian at [[Kyunghee University]] of Korea, and is currently teaching Korean studies as a professor at the Department of Culture Studies and Oriental Languages, [[University of Oslo]] in [[Norway]].&lt;ref name="newscham" /&gt;

==Statements on China==
In 2009, he made the remark that the "[[economy of South Korea|Korean economy]] will be annexed by the Chinese economic zone within 5&amp;ndash;10 years". The Korean left responded critically to this claim, but Pak went on to clarify his thesis. According to his column, "it is not ''proper'', I just said ''inescapable''".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redian.org/news/articleView.html?idxno=12500{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, he supported the Chinese government with respect to [[Liu Xiaobo]]'s [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Pak criticized [[Liu Xiaobo]] as a "follower of Western countries" and "a supporter of colonialism in China". According to Pak, "the process of democratization in China is not only elite, but also working-class".

Pak suggests that Liu's support in his [[Charter 08]] of 'legislative democracy' and the 'protection of private property' raises doubts on whether "Liu Xiaobo wants a 'non-communist, dictatorial China' or a 'worker-friendly China'". Pak claims that "true reform must be undertaken by the working class".&lt;ref&gt;노벨 평화상 유감 - 유효파 선생, 서구의 화려함에 넋을 잃으셨나요? {{cite web |url=http://www.redian.org/news/articleView.html?idxno=20183 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928131347/http://www.redian.org/news/articleView.html?idxno=20183 |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Llosas family has traditionally been active in the Catalan textile industry as cotton [[Weaving|weavers]]; in the 19th century they established themselves in middle-low range of the local [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Paternal grandfather of Pedro, [[Juan Llosas Pujol]], originated from [[Olot]] ([[Girona Province|Girona province]]), located in the comarca of [[Garrotxa|Alt Garrotxa]] at the [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] foothills.&lt;ref&gt;Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; His son and Pedro’s father, [[Juan Llosas Tenas]] (died 1872), in early years left his native region for [[Albacete]], for over 20 years assisting his uncle in running a textile business.&lt;ref&gt;Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; When the shop was inherited by his cousin, Albert Escubós Llosas, he returned to Olot and married Rosa Badía Trull (died 1896),&lt;ref&gt;''Eco de la montaña'' 31.05.96, available [http://www.bibgirona.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000133235&amp;page=4 here], ''L’Olotí'' 31.05.96, available [http://www.bibgirona.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000223649&amp;page=16 here]&lt;/ref&gt; a native of [[Sallent]] ([[Barcelona province]]).&lt;ref&gt;Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The couple possessed land properties in the neighboring [[Santa Pau]] and [[Mieres, Girona|Mieres]].&lt;ref&gt;Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Pedro was the only child of the couple.&lt;ref&gt;Rosa Badia's certificate of death, available [http://s16.postimg.org/jv15ehv9x/dbc6794d_b07a_4a6b_a5d8_0a57760d7254.jpg here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Except that he was very early orphaned by his father, next to nothing is known about Pedro’s early childhood in Olot, a town that became a headquarters of Carlism during the [[Third Carlist War]]. In 1882 he entered the nearby Seminario-Colegio de Santa María del Collell, originally an ecclesiastic seminary in 1876 merged with Instituto de Segunda Enseñanza de Girona; the establishment allowed pursuing religious path but offered also commercial studies.&lt;ref&gt;''Bulleti del Santuari S.

Llosas graduated in 1890, his dissertation dedicated to the [[Tiberius Gracchus|Gracchus]] land reforms in the [[ancient Rome]] and acknowledged with excellent marks.&lt;ref&gt;Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued scientific path later on, already when he served as deputy in [[Madrid]]; in 1915 he graduated in Madrid in history,&lt;ref&gt;some scholars suspect he might have intended to obtain PhD laurels, Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; his thesis titled ''Renaixement de Catalunya, època del rei Martí l'Humà'';&lt;ref&gt;''El Deber'' 04.12.15, referred after ''¡Arriba España!'' 04.12.65, available [http://www.bibgirona.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000287197&amp;page=5 here]&lt;/ref&gt; also later he remained particularly interested in [[archeology]].&lt;ref&gt;„aficionat a l’arqueologia”, Josep Burch i Rius et al.

In the late 19th century Olot was among Catalan Carlist strongholds. Painting activity of [[Olot school|Escuela de Olot]] and literary works of Marian Vayreda y Vila made it cultural centre of regional Traditionalism and conservative Catalanism.&lt;ref&gt;there is massive literature on Vayreda, covering his paintings, his literary works, his political activity and his ideology; on the latter, see e.g. Rafael Botella García-Lastra, ''El carlismo en la novela'', [in:] Miguel Ayuso (ed.), ''A los 175 años del carlismo'', Madrid, 2011, {{ISBN|978-8493678777}}, pp. 401–434 Narcís Selles, ''Entre un món residual i un món emergent'', [in:] ''Esposició antologica de Marian Vayreda i Vila (1853 - 1903)'', Olot 2003, pp. 25–31, Narcís Selles, ''Marian Vayreda: idealització i conflicte davant d'una realitat canviant'', [in:] ''Revista de Girona'' 220 (2003), pp. 30–35, Edgar Illas, ''Marià Vayreda.

His parliamentarian activity – vibrant especially during earlier terms&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in 1907 he spoke 20 times, Artagan 1912, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; - was marked mostly by defense of Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;in recognition of his merits, in 1914 he was awarded Pro Ecclesia et Pontífice, a papal medal conferred upon those distinguished in their service to the Church, Moret i Llosas 1994, pp. 58-9&lt;/ref&gt; and by his modest Catalanism,&lt;ref&gt;Moret i Llosas 1994, pp. 56-7&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in confronting the government sponsored [[:es:Ley del Candado|Ley del Candado]].&lt;ref&gt;compare ''El Kulturkamf Español.

==Bewildered==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|left|Carlist standard]]
In the late 1910s the Catalan Carlism was undergoing rapid fragmentation, marked by at least three not necessarily overlapping division lines: between supporters of the key party theorist [[Juan Vázquez de Mella|Vázquez de Mella]] versus supporters of the [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|claimant]], between those approaching nascent Catalanism with sympathy versus those viewing it with caution, and between a faction favoring wide conservative alliances versus a faction sticking to stand-alone intransigence.&lt;ref&gt;other division lines were between Carlists who viewed their movement as „party of order” versus young urban militants with penchant for violence, see Colin M. Winston, ''Workers and the Right in Spain, 1900-1936, Princeton 2014'', {{ISBN|9781400858095}}, p. 85, and differences over personal issues, e.g. in case of Llerida province, see Conxita Mir, ''Lleida (1890-1936): caciquisme polític i lluita electoral'', Barcelona 1985, {{ISBN|9788472027169}}, pp. 308-310&lt;/ref&gt; Though a 1912 Carlist propaganda publication hailed his „acrisolada lealtad a los ideales Católico-Monárquicos”,&lt;ref&gt;Artagan 1912, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Llosas was not immune to growing confusion.

In Girona the key division line was about the Catalan question.&lt;ref&gt;some areas of the Olot district adopted "un posicionament proper al regionalisme i encetaren un acostament a la Lliga", while in the Girona generally the mood was rather against the Catalanists, Costa Fernández 1994, pp. 32-3&lt;/ref&gt; Llosas, unlike other key Carlist from the province [[Dalmacio Iglesias García|Dalmacio Iglesias]], tended to demonstrate more attraction for Catalanism than the official party executive would allow. In 1917 he took part in [[:es:Asamblea de Parlamentarios|Parliamentary Assembly]], a gathering of some 70 senators and deputies mostly from Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;''El Pais'' 08.07.17, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002539658&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Called in the wake of growing social tension, the congregation declared the Restoration political system defunct and assumed a potentially revolutionary shape, pursuing also a highly regionalist model of state.&lt;ref&gt;Llosas and others were "baluarte monarquico ante las amenazas militares y civiles"; some sources claimed that Llosas himself co-drafted an autonomy proposal, later supported by the regionalists and others, Maximiliano Fuentes Codera, ''España en la Primera Guerra Mundial: Una movilización cultural'', Madrid 2014, {{ISBN|9788446040262}}, page unavailable, accessible [https://books.google.ru/books?id=4rsABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT162 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Carlists decided to abstain, Llosas joined the initiative on his own; some authors claim that he broke with the party,&lt;ref&gt;Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; but others underline that proposals of the Assembly were later supported by the Carlists.&lt;ref&gt;other authors claim the autonomist proposals of the assembly were supported by the Jaimists, see Fuentes Codera 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish general election, 1918|1918 electoral campaign]] produced total bewilderment. Despite Llosas’ taking part in the pro-Catalanist Assembly, La Lliga terminated the truce with the Carlists and fielded his counter-candidate in Olot. The Carlists themselves were divided into 3 factions led by [[:es:Miguel Junyent|Junyent]], Iglesias and Llosas, the latter turned against La Lliga running as an ultra-Right anti-regionalist hopeful.&lt;ref&gt;Junyent concluded alliances with La Lliga and the Maurists, while Llosas, Iglesias and Trias were presenting themselves as ultra-Right anti-regionalists candidates, supported by the anti-regionalist ''El Norte'', Xavier Tornafoch, ''Política, eleccions i caciquisme a Vic'' [PhD thesis Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona], Barcelona 2003, p. 199, also Costa Fernández 1994 p. 34, Balcells, Culla, Mir 1982, pp. 249, 256, 263&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his differences with party executive, he was widely referred to as "carlí", "jaumí"&lt;ref&gt;Balcells, Culla, Mir 1982, pp. 256, 571, also ''ABC'' 25.02.18, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1918/02/25/010.html here], ''El Sol'' 12.02.18, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000184647&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; or "tradicionalista".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Balcells, Enric Pujol, Jordi Sabater, ''La Mancomunitat de Catalunya i L'Autonomia'', Barcelona 1996, {{ISBN|9788472833296}} p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; By a narrow margin he seemed to have lost to his Lliguero rival.&lt;ref&gt;having gained 45,37% of the votes; his victorious counter-candidate, a Lliguero candidate, obtained 53,97% of the votes (abstention 16,99%), Balcells, Culla, Mir 1982, p.571. In the early campaigns, when in open accord with La Lliga, Llosas enjoyed absolute majority among the electorate, but over time his domination decreased. In 1907 he was supported by 75% of those eligible to vote, in 1910 by 65%, in 1914 by 37%. For 1916 - as he had no counter-candidate - no number-crunching is possible. In 1918 he was supported by 38% of the electorate, but his Lliguero rival attracted 45% of those eligible, data Balcells, Culla, Mir 1982&lt;/ref&gt; He protested, pressing charges of corruption; investigations and backstage haggling continued until he was finally declared defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:HUU.12.21.12.jpg|thumbnail|Llosas with bishops, Colegio de Santa María del Collell, 1919]]
When the internal Carlist conflict between de Mella and [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Don Jaime]] exploded in 1919 Llosas seemed posed to join the [[Mellismo|rebels]]. In the Cortes under the influence of the former&lt;ref&gt;in 1912 formed part of grupo parlamentario africanista, co-led by Vázquez de Mella. ''El Siglo Futuro'' 24.12.12, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000309817&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and sharing his penchant for grand conservative alliances,&lt;ref&gt;Molas 2009, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; initially he tended to stand against the claimant.&lt;ref&gt;in Catalonia Carlism fragmented into 3 groupings: firstly the majoritarian one headed by Junyent, Trias and Roma, organized around Correo Catalan, pro-League and loyal to Don Jaime; secondly the minoritarian one led by Pedro Vives and centred around Ateneu Tradicionalista and thirdly another one, led by Dalmacio Iglesias and dominating in Girona province, the latter ones sided with the Mellistas, Balcells, Culla, Mir 1982, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually he declared himself neutral;&lt;ref&gt;Molas 2009, p. 10; the provincial Girona jefatura of the Mellistas went to Joaquim de Solà Morales&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, after the breakup he was listed neither among the breakaway Mellistas&lt;ref&gt;Llosas is not a single time mentioned in scholarly monograph on the Mellista movement, see Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, ''El cisma mellista. Historia de una ambición política'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|9788487863820}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor the loyal Jaimistas. Instead, he neared the right wing of disintegrating [[Conservative Party (Spain)|Conservatives]], the [[Antonio Maura|Mauristas]];&lt;ref&gt;Molas 2009, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Spanish general election, 1919|1919 electoral campaign]] he unsuccessfully ran for the [[Senate (Spain)|Senate]] as a governmental candidate,&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 07.06.19, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000363280&amp;page=3 here], ''El Pais'' 14.06.19, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002572909&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; defeated for the upper chamber also in [[Spanish general election, 1920|1921]] with only 16% of the votes gathered;&lt;ref&gt;Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; some kept referring to him as "jaimista".&lt;ref&gt;''El Sol'' 14.06.19, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000210440&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Llosas’s affair with the Mauristas continued; in October 1921 Maura, prime minister at that time, appointed him [[:es:Gobernador civil|civil governor]] of the [[Baleares (province)|Balearic Islands]]. Little is known about his tenure; according to present-day scholar, he demonstrated rather heavy hand and acted along "lógica dins un sistema caciquista basat en la venjanca",&lt;ref&gt;Isabel Peñarrubia i Marquès, ''Els partits polítics davant el caciquisme i la qüestió nacional a Mallorca (1917-1923)'', Barcelona 1991, {{ISBN|9788478262724}}, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; having been firm element of the [[:es:Caciquismo (España)|caciquismo]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;Peñarrubia i Marquès 1991, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons which are not clear he resigned from the governor post in April 1922 and returned to Olot.&lt;ref&gt;Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Llosas welcomed the 1923 coup of general [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]] and already in 1924 he was busy setting up provincial structures of nascent [[Patriotic Union (Spain)|Unión Patriótica]]; he emerged heading the Olot branch,&lt;ref&gt;Costa Fernández 1994, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; though he did not enter the provincial Girona executive.&lt;ref&gt;Costa Fernández 1994, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Also 1924 he was nominated to two Catalan self-government bodies, provincial and regional ones, normally elected but its members appointed under the new dictatorial regime. One was Diputación Provincial of Girona,&lt;ref&gt;Costa Fernández 1994, pp. 185-6&lt;/ref&gt; whose members elected him president of the body.&lt;ref&gt;with 18 votes in favor and 1 abstaining, Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Another was Permanent Council of [[Commonwealth of Catalonia|Mancomunitat de Catalunya]];&lt;ref&gt;Costa Fernández 1994, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; he briefly served as Conseller de Ferrocarrils i Obres Hidràuliques and member of Consell de Pedagogia, before becoming member of Consell de Cultura.&lt;ref&gt;Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; At the latter post he shielded [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans]] from growing [[Spanish nationalism|españolismo]],&lt;ref&gt;viewed with sincere hostility by the government, Costa Fernández 1994, p. 285. Llosas vehemently opposed attempts to merge the Institute with the University, Costa Fernández 1994, p. 287-8; he also helped to develop new activities of the Institute, like library, meteorological, historic-archeologic and especially philology services, establishing as a newly created section, „Servicio de Investigaciones Filológicas” - Costa Fernández 1994, pp. 286-9&lt;/ref&gt; advocated introduction of Catalan to schools&lt;ref&gt;Costa Fernández 1994, pp. 285-6&lt;/ref&gt; and developed local libraries.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 24.10.24, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1935/02/21/pagina-6/33269071/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 the Girona diputación addressed Primo with a Llosas-inspired document, which opposed centralization designs of Catalan capitán [[:es:Emilio Barrera|general Barrera]]&lt;ref&gt;other author claims that Llosas was not in favor of abolishing Mancomunitat, Costa Fernández 1994, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; and advanced a highly regionalist vision of state in general and Catalonia in particular.&lt;ref&gt;"posicionament regionalista de Llosas", Costa Fernández 1994, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; The paper proposed a province-centred organization of Catalonia modeled on the [[Names of the Basque Country (in Spanish)|Vascongadas]].&lt;ref&gt;"amb una actitud propera a la manifestada antigament per carlins i jaumins, que propagaven una solució semblant a les diputacions basques, és a dir, implantar el régim provincial de les provincies bascongades", Costa Fernández 1994, p. 196; opposing centralist views were sponsored presided by general Barrera and Frederic Bassols&lt;/ref&gt; It suggested that on the regional level Mancomunitat, itself deemed artificial, is replaced by a new body, Diputación Regional, its members delegated from provincial chambers, themselves elected on universal, corporative and municipal basis.&lt;ref&gt;Costa Fernández 1994, pp. 191-2&lt;/ref&gt; However, the new [[:es:Estatuto Provincial de 1925|primoderiverista Estatuto Provincial]] potentially led to dissolution of regional bodies;&lt;ref&gt;the new Provincial Stature it did not necessarily mean dissolving Mancomunitat, Costa Fernández 1994, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; anxious to retain some regional co-ordination,&lt;ref&gt;Costa Fernández 1994, pp. 198-9; Llosas was anxious that lack of regional coordination would produce a downturn in some areas, especially public works, Costa Fernández 1994, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Llosas failed to convince other members of the Girona diputation,&lt;ref&gt;bowing to the pressure of provincial civil governor Urquía&lt;/ref&gt; who effectively buried the idea of Mancomunitat.&lt;ref&gt;Costa Fernández 1994, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging defeat Llosas resigned as head of Girona self-government.&lt;ref&gt;some refer to the event as „fi de la carrera política de Llosas a Girona”. Costa Fernández 1994, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he took part in works of Comissió Gestora entrusted with phasing out Mancomunitat until the body ceased to exist in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite differences with the military, Llosas by no means could have been considered in opposition to Primo;&lt;ref&gt;„vinculat al poder de Madrid”, Jordi Pujiula, ''Dictadura, República i Guerra Civil'', Olot 2005, {{ISBN|9788493262457}}, pp. 13&lt;/ref&gt; his stance during tenure in Diputación Provincial and Mancomunitat should rather be viewed as efforts to find a compromise within framework of the regime.

Llosas enjoyed excellent financial standing; apart from family properties, he held managerial posts in the Olot branch of [[:es:Banco Hispano Americano|Banco Hispano Americano]],&lt;ref&gt;Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 55. In the 1920s the Spanish financial market was subject to consolidation, with 5 major banks dominating the industry - Banco Hispano Americano, Banco Español de Credito, Banco Central, Banco de Bilbao and Banco de Vizcaya, Moisés Llordén Miñambres, Manuel-Jesús González, ''De empresas y empresarios en la España contemporanea'', Oviedo 1995, {{ISBN|9788474688191}}, p. 96. One of the most aggressive players, Banco Hispano Americano, pursued a growth strategy consisting of taking over smalle banks and convering them into own branches – from 6 (1914) to 20 (1919), 50 (1923) and 87 (1926) Llordén, González 1995, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; the giant which took over Banco Llosas Escubós in the mid-1920s;&lt;ref&gt;BHE entered merger talks with Banco Llosas Escubós in 1920 Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 55, also ''El Financiero'' 20.08.20, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0025435348&amp;page=6 here], completing the process in 1923, Muñoz García Muñoz, ''El Fracaso de la Burguesía Financiera Catalana: La Crisis Del Banco de Barcelona'', Barcelona 1988, {{ISBN|9788477310099}}, p. 308; Llosas grew also to vice-president of Asociación de Banqueros de Barcelona - Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; he was referred to as "banquer",&lt;ref&gt;Molas 2009, p. 19, Balcells, Culla, Mir 1982, p. 430, also "ex-banquer", Costa Fernández 1994, pp. 185-6&lt;/ref&gt; "propietario",&lt;ref&gt;Molas 2009, p. 13, Balcells, Culla, Mir 1982, p. 430&lt;/ref&gt; "comerciante" and "haciendista".&lt;ref&gt;Artagan 1912, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; He basked in prestige of key Girona politician,&lt;ref&gt;Pujiula 2005, pp. 13, 22, 185&lt;/ref&gt; a charismatic figure&lt;ref&gt;Costa Fernández 1994, p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; and local patricio, his house continuously visited by applicants seeking support.&lt;ref&gt;for a picturesque account see ''¡Arriba España''! 03.04.48, available [http://www.bibgirona.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000273326&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Llosas’ position changed dramatically upon advent of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]]: as a former dictatorship tycoon, a monarchist and a Traditionalist reactionary he found himself politically sidetracked. A street in Santa Pau, named after him in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 01.05.30, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1929/05/15/pagina-6/33217585/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; was immediately renamed to Via de la República in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 26.09.31, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1933/11/09/pagina-21/33174239/pdf.html here]; the street was restored as Calle Pedro Llosas in the Francoist era, ''Revista de Girona'' 01.01.70, available [http://www.bibgirona.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000490788&amp;page=22 here]. Currently it is named Avenida Olot – Bañolas, Salvador Reixach, ''Santa Pau'', Girona 1998, {{ISBN|8486812917}}, p, 63, available [http://www.bibgirona.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000365431&amp;page=63 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Llosas focused on religious activity: in the early 1930s he took part in Catholic initiatives like Pro Ecclesia et Patria weeks, contributed to confessional periodicals&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 21.02.35, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1935/02/21/pagina-17/33141889/pdf.html here], ''La Vanguardia'' 26.09.34, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1928/07/26/pagina-17/33153563/pdf.html here], ''La Vanguardia'' 05.10.34, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1928/07/26/pagina-20/33154812/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1933 led a large group of Catalans visiting [[Vatican City|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 13.09.33, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1933/09/13/029.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; He resumed contacts with Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;which renewed as Comunión Tradicionalista re-admitted also the former primoderiverista officials. Llosas was not listed as member of Junta Provincial de Girona, Josep Clara, ''La Comunió Tradicionalista a Girona (1931-1936)'', [in:] ''El Carlisme entra Dues Guerres, 1876-1936, Revista de Girona'' 1991, p. 84-5. He is known to have supported the Carlist daily ''El Siglo Futuro'' financially, see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 21.12.35, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000569038&amp;page=7 here]. Some authors claim that Llosas stance during the dictatorship contributed to demise of Carlism in the province, which at the advent of the Republic was in "punt més baix de la seva história, com una relíquia del passat" and looked dead - "també semhiaven morís, pero no pas enterráis, els carlins. Pocs i mal avinguts. resten un poc pertot i especialment a la Garrotxa, alguns contumacos que no s'acaben de decidirá desaparéixer. A la capilal, una dotzena mal comptada completa aquesta fauna que sembla destinada a esvair-se en un futur molt próxim", Clara 1991, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; During run-up to the [[Spanish general election, 1933|1933 electoral campaign]] he was initially reported as standing in candidatura de derecha agraría, neighboring with frontline Carlist activists like [[María Rosa Urraca Pastor|Urraca Pastor]] and defined as "tradicionalista";&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 09.11.33, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1929/05/15/pagina-19/33188294/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; eventually he declared the news not authorized.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 11.11.33, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1933/11/09/pagina-17/33188360/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; He kept supplying historical and religious articles to Traditionalist periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;in Catalan, e.g. ''A proposit de les festes de Corpus'', published in'' Tradició Catalana'' 02.06.34, available [http://www.bibgirona.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000258535&amp;page=7 here]; Llosas kept pursuing his historical and archeological interest throughout all his life, publishing also in the 1910s and 1920s, see booklets ''Olot en temps d’Alfons V el Mangánim'' (1913), ''La Reyna Empordanesa. D Sibila de Fortcá'' (1923), ''Jaime I el Conquistador'' (1929), and articles, e.g. ''El diplomatari del Comitat del Besalú'', [in:]'' Renovació: fulles populars de la Joventut Nacionalista'' 31.01.18, pp. 61-64, ''Viva nueva... resurrección'', [in:] ''Vida Parroquial'' 2 (1929), pp. 3-7&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1936 Llosas together with other Catalan Carlists&lt;ref&gt;like Miguel Junyent, [[Joaquín Bau]], [[:es:Bartolomé Trías|Bartolomé Trias]] or Luis Argemi&lt;/ref&gt; took part in broad monarchist gatherings led by [[Calvo Sotelo]],&lt;ref&gt;''Correo de Tortosa'' 21.01.36&lt;/ref&gt; though his relations with Carlism remained loose.&lt;ref&gt;Llosas is not a single time mentioned either in history of Carlism during the Republic in Spain, see Martin Blinkhorn, ''Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939'', Cambridge 2008, {{ISBN|9780521207294}}, or in Catalonia, see Robert Vallverdú i Martí, ''El Carlisme Català Durant La Segona República Espanyola 1931-1936'', Barcelona 2008, {{ISBN|9788478260805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Llosas welcomed the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|coup of July 1936]] though there is no information on him having been involved.&lt;ref&gt;Moret i Llosas 1994, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Spanish Civil War|outbreak of hostilities]] Olot was overtaken by Republican militias, who raided estates belonging to individuals deemed sympathetic towards the Right; according to one version the Llosas’ Mas Quintana mansion in Santa Pau was ransacked, with all movable items robbed and the immovable ones&lt;ref&gt;like massive stone altar in family chapel in Santa Pau&lt;/ref&gt; destroyed;&lt;ref&gt;Alber Planas i Serra, ''Guerra civil i repressió franquista a Santa Pau'', [in:] ''Ebre'' 38/4 (2010), p. 107, available [http://www.raco.cat/index.php/ebre/article/viewFile/216264/287036 here]; also Alber Planas i Serra, ''Joan Pinsach i Solé, L’alcalde de Santa Pau afusellat per franquisme'', Barcelona 2009, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; according to another, it was expropriated in an orderly manner.&lt;ref&gt;on September 6, 1936, Planas i Serra 2009, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Though his age did not save from execution,&lt;ref&gt;among others, also an individual aged 65 was executed by Republican militia in Santa Pau, Planas i Serra 2010, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; he survived the outburst of revolutionary zeal. None of the sources consulted provides information on his whereabouts during the Civil War. Immediately following [[Catalonia Offensive|Nationalist seizure of Catalonia]], in February 1939 Llosas rushed to offer his services to the new Presidente de la Diputación,&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia Española'' 17.02.39, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1939/02/07/pagina-5/33121223/pdf.html here]; the first Nationalist troops, the Navarrese Carlist [[requeté]] units, entered Santa Pau on February 8, 1939&lt;/ref&gt; March 1939 entrusted with gathering trade and industry managers of Girona province to proceed with the post-war reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia Española'' 03.03.39, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1939/02/07/pagina-5/33121841/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; However, apart from the very early months of Francoism in Catalonia he was no longer reported as engaged in any official activities.
[[File:FrancoenReus.jpg|thumbnail|[[Francoism]] in Catalonia, 1940s]]
There is almost no information on Llosas’ public activity in the 1940s and later.&lt;ref&gt;Llosas is not a single time mentioned in post-civil war history of Catalan Carlism, Robert Vallverdú i Martí, ''La metamorfosi del carlisme català: del "Déu, Pàtria i Rei" a l'Assamblea de Catalunya (1936-1975)'', Barcelona 2014, {{ISBN|9788498837261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its key thread was engagement in numerous religious initiatives,&lt;ref&gt;Acctión Católica, Conferencias de San Vicente de Paúl, Junta de la Minerva or Venerable Orden Tercera del Carmen, ''Acció Católica'' 13.01.51,''¡Arriba España!'' 03.12.55, available [http://www.bibgirona.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000277710&amp;page=10 here]&lt;/ref&gt; reported as late as the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia Española'' 04.09.42, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1992/02/16/pagina-7/33104587/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Another was culture; apart from sporadic public appearances&lt;ref&gt;like delivering public lecture on Vayreda, ''¡Arriba España!'' 25.05.43, available [http://www.bibgirona.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000271232&amp;page=18 here]&lt;/ref&gt; he was supplying historical pieces, usually related to religious topics, to the press, mostly to the Girona edition of ''[[:es:Arriba España (periódico)|¡Arriba España!]]'';&lt;ref&gt;the first one identified published in ''¡Arriba España!'' of 11.11.39, available [http://www.bibgirona.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000269776&amp;page=2 here], the last one in ''¡Arriba España!'' 14.07.51, available [http://www.bibgirona.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000274401&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; the periodical referred to him as "respectable y querido amigo".&lt;ref&gt;''¡Arriba España!'' 13.05.45, available [http://www.bibgirona.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000272123&amp;page=6 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 he became a great-grandfather,&lt;ref&gt;''¡Arriba España!'' 22.02.47, available [http://www.bibgirona.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000273238&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; but since 1949 he remained seriously disabled.&lt;ref&gt;''¡Arriba España!'' 12.03.49, available [http://www.bibgirona.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000273333&amp;page=5 here]&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral was attended by president of Diputación Provincial, alcalde of Olot, leaders of provincial [[Movimiento Nacional|Movimiento]] and representatives of Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia Española'' 01.12.55, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1935/02/21/pagina-30/32785682/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; His obituary in ''¡Arriba España!'' claimed he had always been a Traditionalist.&lt;ref&gt;''¡Arriba España!'' 03.12.55, available [http://www.bibgirona.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000277710&amp;page=8 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

During and following the [[Korean War]], prostitutes in [[South Korea]] were frequently used by the [[U.S. military]].

Until the early 1990s, the term Prostitutes (comfort women) was used to include people who were prostitutes to soldiers. Today, there is a debate about whether it is appropriate to express comfort women as comfort women by saying comfort women as a means of forced mobilization to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=유승희 "박정희 시절'미군위안부'관리, 대통령 친필 결재 서류 존재" |url=https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=101&amp;oid=022&amp;aid=0002594444 |website=news.naver.com |accessdate=8 August 2018 |language=ko |date=6 November 2013 |trans-title=Yoo Seung-hee "When Park Chung Hee was in charge of" US military comfort women "}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Strand Frisian''' was a dialect of the [[North Frisian language]] which was originally spoken on [[Strand (island)|Strand island]], [[Duchy of Schleswig]]. Strand was destroyed in the [[Burchardi flood]] of 1634 with its remnants forming the islands [[Pellworm]] and [[Nordstrand, Germany|Nordstrand]] which are now part of Germany. Strand Frisian is counted among the mainland group of North Frisian dialects.

==History==
The Frisian language became extinct on Nordstrand in the 17th century while it was spoken on Pellworm until the 18th century. After the 1634 flood, refugees from Strand brought their dialect to [[Wyk auf Föhr]] where it was spoken until the 19th century. Like the now extinct Wyk dialect, the [[Halligen Frisian]] can be seen as a continuation of the former Strand Frisian.

==Notable works==
The most notable piece of literature in Strand Frisian is a translation of [[Martin Luther]]'s ''[[Luther's Small Catechism|Small Catechism]]'' from the time before 1634.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Walther |last=Ziesemer |title=Nordfriesischer Katechismus in Strander und Föhringer Mundart |journal=Niederdeutsches Jahrbuch |language=German |volume=48 |year=1922 |pages=53–74}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Other works include the "Yn Miren-Söngh" [A Morning Song] and "Yn Een-Söngh" [An Evening Song] by preacher Anton Heimreich (1626–1685) from Nordstrand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ommo |last=Wilts |chapter=Die nordfriesische Literatur |editor-first=Horst Haider |editor-last=Munske |title=Handbuch des Friesischen – Handbook of Frisian Studies |publisher=Niemeyer |location=Tübingen |year=2001 |language=German, English |isbn=3-484-73048-X |page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''M.

Tondern, 1819, erster Theil, p. 27–30&lt;/ref&gt; Knudt Andreas Frerks (1815–1899), a pastor from Wyk, wrote a translation of the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] in the Wyk North Frisian dialect.

{{Nihongo|'''Takuya Iwasaki'''|岩崎 卓也|Iwasaki Takuya|July 9, 1929 – February 4, 2018}} was a Japanese archaeologist.

==Biography==
He was an expert in the Neolithic and early period of the Middle East and has conducted much research into sites in countries like Syria and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Iwasaki|first=Takuya|author2=恵子·石田|title=Tell Mastuma: An Iron Age Settlement in Northwest Syria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qu4kYAAACAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Ancient Orient Museum|isbn=978-4-906127-03-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MatthewsNashli2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthews|first1=Roger|last2=Nashli|first2=Hassan Fazeli|title=The Neolithisation of Iran|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SuM7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA201|date=11 December 2013|publisher=Oxbow Books|isbn=978-1-78297-191-7|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iwasaki was a Professor at the [[University of Tsukuba]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2845">The '''Three Eras''' is a [[Judeo-Christian]] scheme of periods in [[historiography]], called also  ''Vaticinium Eliae'' (prophecy of Elijah or Elias). A three-period division of time appears in the [[Babylonian Talmud]]: the period before the giving of the law (''[[Torah]]''); the period subject to the law; and the period of the [[Messiah]]. This scheme was later adapted to Christian use, with three periods corresponding to the persons of the [[Trinity]]. In that form it was taken up by [[Joachim of Fiore]];&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd S. Kramer, Lloyd Kramer, Sarah C. Maza, Sarah Maza, ''A Companion to Western Historical Thought'' (2006), p. 83; [https://books.google.com/books?id=zpPWwBS1C60C&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=%22Vaticinium+Eliae%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UqhK5s6Ndy&amp;sig=onhTbaluQG_TMhEyp6-d4oQPA-k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8Ul7TsfEKoy98gP6qLwf&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Vaticinium%20Eliae%22&amp;f=false Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; it had been held in a similar form a little earlier by the [[Amalricians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Amalricians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Protestant Reformation]] the scheme of the "prophecy of Elias" was popularised by [[Philip Melanchthon]] and his [[Lutheran]] collaborators, using ''[[Carion's Chronicle]]'' as a vehicle, heavily edited into due form. The three periods were 'without the law', 'under law', and 'under grace'.&lt;ref&gt;G. J. R. Parry, ''A Protestant Vision: William Harrison and the Reformation of Elizabethan England'' (2002), p. 97; [https://books.google.com/books?id=u8BlfZeqCO0C&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=%22three+periods%22+%22Jean+Bodin%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M9TwGxVpPj&amp;sig=v8i0c9O1hxPxVSLeuWPL1DPtGE4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ilt7To2FK4q18QPJ560P&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22three%20periods%22%20%22Jean%20Bodin%22&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; With each period attributed a length of two millennia, the scheme was applied to predict the end of time (or at least the commencement of a final seventh millennium). This was done by [[Johann Heinrich Alsted]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Hotson, ''Paradise Postponed: Johann Heinrich Alsted and the birth of Calvinist millenarianism'' (2000), p. 52; [https://books.google.com/books?id=mcKjRVM4CuIC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=%22prophecy+of+Elias%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=96-fH9vtw3&amp;sig=rJcP4-Wq1xL7cDQW3az4FJ96vBc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SVx7TqlmjMDxA_CN8Tw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22prophecy%20of%20Elias%22&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was widely influential in its tripartite structure, seen also in the chronology of [[Achilles Pirmin Gasser]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Westman, ''The Copernican Question: Prognostication, Skepticism, and Celestial Order'', pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

The types shown are (clockwise from top) cordate, ficron, and ovate.]]'''Use-wear analysis''' is a method in [[archaeology]] to identify the functions of [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] tools by closely examining their working surfaces and edges. It is mainly used on [[stone tools]], and is sometimes referred to as "traceological analysis" (from the neologism ''traceology'').

In studying the wear on a [[Lithic analysis|lithics]], different techniques are often used. A distinction is often made between use-wear and microwear analysis. Use-wear uses an approach of low magnification study while micro-wear employs high magnification; this raises contentions as to which approach is more useful.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keeley|first=Lawrence H.|date=1980|title=Experimental Determination of Stone Tool Uses: A Microwear Analysis.|url=|journal=University of Chicago Pres|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, use-wear studies regularly employ magnification up to 50x, while magnification beyond 50x is relegated to microwear analysis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aoyama|first=Kazuo|date=2007|title=Elite artists and craft producers in Classic Maya society: lithic evidence from Aguateca, Guatemala|url=|journal=Latin American Antiquity|volume=18|pages=3–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamminga|first=B|date=1982|title=Over the edge: functional analysis of Australian stone tools|url=|journal=Occasional Papers in Archaeology|volume=12|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the two groups of magnification in which researchers align themselves, a third group examines evidence of use by attempting to identify organic residues present on a lithic.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banning|first=E. B.|date=2000|title=The archaeologist’s laboratory: the analysis of archaeological data|url=|journal=Springer US|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organic residues are analyzed in order to understand the activities the lithics were used for such as butchering, or other tasks which can leave behind traces of working with wood, ceramics, or plant remains.

Tool edge damage and polish are two major sources for information about the use of a tool. Variations of polish type are formed depending on how a tool edge is used functionally, on the type(s) of material, and duration of use.

The type of edge damage also varies among different tools. But a distinction is necessary between the intended use, what the tool maker designed the tool for, and actual use. This is an important distinction to note as tools can be used for more than its intended function or designed for several purposes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; An often noted example from modern culture are screwdrivers which are designed for driving screws but are regularly used to open cans of paint. This type of multi-purpose tool is noted in lithic assemblages by ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological studies.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=J. P.|date=1967|title=Ethnoarchaeology in New Guinea: two examples|url=|journal=Mankind|volume=6|pages=409–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basic edge damage types include step fractures, snap fractures, micro-flake scars, and edge rounding. Fractures are differentiated by looking at both fracture initiation and propagation. Fracture initiation is defined as where and how the fracture of an edge begins. Fracture propagation is defined by the path a crack follows, and the degree of the crack’s growth. Fractures are often used to note how tools are created but also used in wear studies. For example, fracturing can help note whether a tool was used in an outward bending action rather than a downward force which can cause a flake to detach and create damage.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cotterell|first=B|date=1990|title=Mechanics of pre-industrial technology|url=|journal=Cambridge University Press|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to flake scars, abrasion, edge rounding, and striations occurring after tool use, one must be careful to note whether this was from actual use or from handling after excavation/collection. Alterations to a tool’s edge or surface can result from improper handling or storage. For example, two artifacts within the same bag can cause wear marks from constant interaction, also the bags themselves have been noted to cause wear on artifacts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Experimental archaeology]] can be employed to test hypotheses on tool function by replicating different activities with freshly made tools. The reliability of experimental archaeology as an information source for use-wear analysis has been tested through multiple blind tests. These tests judge the ability to identify tool motion and contact material. One study done at the University of California Davis found that tool action was correctly identified 84 percent of the time, while tool material was correctly identified 74 percent of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Haten, N. "The reliability of microscopic use-wear analysis on Monterey chert tools." SCA Proceedings 24 (2010): 1-6. Downloadable from: http://www.scahome.org/publications/proceedings/Proceedings.24Hanten.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliability of experimental archaeology has made it a popular method for analyzing use-wear.The reliability of experimental archaeology has made it a popular method for assisting in the analysis of use-wear. With a microscope and proper training, use-wear analysis can be a useful resource. Although experimental analysis of use-wear may be used for its relatively cheap price, it can be a time consuming endeavor. This may require flint-knapping a tool comparable to the artifact under analysis, which can be long process dependent on personal ability, or buying such a tool. Also, the replication of tool use requires comparable source material (for tool creation) as well as access to the material the tool was used on. Additionally, the experiments must last an acceptable  amount of time; slicing an object once will not suffice and requires countless attempts per tool and per material used upon. One example notes how Méry conducted use-wear analysis and experimental archaeology to examine 7 flint blades from a pottery workshop of Nausharo site in Pakistan, which reveals that these blades were used to trim clay on a turning wheel.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Méry, S., Anderson, P., Inizan, M. L., Lechevallier, M., &amp; Pelegrin, J. (2007). A pottery workshop with flint tools on blades knapped with copper at Nausharo (Indus civilisation, ca. 2500 BC).

==Biography==
Wang Kangle showed his brilliance in art at a young age and was recruited by the Shanghai Commercial Press at age 18. Wang Kangle worked as a designer in the Images Department of the Shanghai Commercial Press from 1924 to 1932. He later studied landscape painting under the guidance of [[Zhang Daqian]], [[Huang Binhong]] and [[Zheng Wuchang]]. Throughout the prime of his life, he contented himself with consulting jade manufacturers and teaching art as the Communist Revolution strongly frowned upon prominent artists.

After the Revolution, he traveled across China and began to develop the style that he is known for today. In 1952, he began to lecture at the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House and the Shanghai Fine Arts College. He held solo exhibitions in Hong Kong, Singapore and New York. He served as a member of Shanghai Research Institute of Culture and History, member of Shanghai Artists' Association, advisor to Huang BinHong Research Society, vice-chairman of Calligraphy and Painting Society of Shanghai and Hong Kong DeFeng Studio.

Today, his artworks can be found in Wang Kangle Art Museum (王康乐艺术馆) located in City of [[Ningbo]], [[Zhejiang]] province at the Xikou Yan Creek River. The 王康乐艺术馆  covers a total area of 12,000 square meters, building area of 3000 square meters. Ground was broken in 1996, the entire project totals and investment of more than 400 million yuan of which Mr. Wang Kangle invested 650,000 yuan and 300 pieces of his fine art. Today, the venue serves exhibition, creative, artistic research, as well as hospitality functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2469">'''Western Film Exchange''' was founded in [[Milwaukee]] in July 1906 by John R. Freuler and Harry E. Aitken for the purpose of mass-producing and distributing [[Western film]]s to movie theaters throughout the American midwest. One of over 100 such "exchanges," Western Film proved to be more successful than most, opening branch offices in several midwestern cities, including [[Chicago]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], and [[Joplin, Missouri]]. Exchanges would negotiate with film studios for the rights to a completed film production, and would distribute the product to [[nickelodeon movie theater]]s.

This business model came to an end in 1908 when the [[Motion Picture Patents Company]] (MPPC; commonly known as the Edison Trust) sued independent film studios on grounds of patent infringement. Most studios did not have the means to stand against the Trust and were forced out of operation. With fewer films being produced, Freuler and Aitken were soon faced with financial difficulties. In order to keep Western Film afloat, they formed a succession of independent studios expressly for the purpose of keeping Western Film supplied with new pictures. The first of these studios was the [[American Film Manufacturing Company]], founded in 1910, which was soon joined by [[Majestic Film]]. Both Western Film and its various affiliated studios were targeted by the MPPC to little avail: so successful were Freuler and Aitken's ventures that, in 1912, they partnered with the Shallenberger brothers (Wilbert E. and William Edgar), Crawford Livingston, and Charles J. Hite to found a new company, [[Mutual Film Corporation]], which eventually came to replace the Western Film Exchange.
