{{distinguish|algebraic representation}}
In [[abstract algebra]], a '''representation of an [[associative algebra]]''' is a [[module (mathematics)|module]] for that algebra. Here an associative algebra is a (not necessarily [[unital algebra|unital]]) [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. If the algebra is not unital, it may be made so in a standard way (see the [[adjoint functors]] page); there is no essential difference between modules for the resulting unital ring, in which the identity acts by the identity mapping, and representations of the algebra.

== Examples ==
=== Linear complex structure ===
{{main|Linear complex structure}}
One of the simplest non-trivial examples is a [[linear complex structure]], which is a representation of the [[complex number]]s '''C''', thought of as an associative algebra over the [[real number]]s '''R'''. This algebra is realized concretely as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = \mathbb{R}[i]/(i^2+1),&lt;/math&gt; which corresponds to {{math|1={{mvar|i}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1 }}. Then a representation of '''C''' is a real vector space ''V'', together with an action of '''C''' on ''V'' (a map &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} \to \mathrm{End}(V)&lt;/math&gt;). Concretely, this is just an action of {{mvar|i}} , as this generates the algebra, and the operator representing {{mvar|i}} (the image of ''i'' in End(''V'')) is denoted ''J'' to avoid confusion with the identity matrix ''I'').

=== Polynomial algebras ===
Another important basic class of examples are representations of [[polynomial algebra]]s, the free commutative algebras – these form a central object of study in [[commutative algebra]] and its geometric counterpart, [[algebraic geometry]]. A representation of a polynomial algebra in {{mvar|k}} variables over the field ''K'' is concretely a ''K''-vector space with {{mvar|k}} commuting operators, and is often denoted &lt;math&gt;K[T_1,\dots,T_k],&lt;/math&gt; meaning the representation of the abstract algebra &lt;math&gt;K[x_1,\dots,x_k]&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_i \mapsto T_i.&lt;/math&gt;

A basic result about such representations is that, over an algebraically closed field, the representing matrices are [[Triangular matrix#Simultaneous triangularisability|simultaneously triangularisable]].

Even the case of representations of the polynomial algebra in a single variable are of interest – this is denoted by &lt;math&gt;K[T]&lt;/math&gt; and is used in understanding the structure of a single linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space. Specifically, applying the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]] to this algebra yields as [[Structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain#Corollaries|corollaries]] the various canonical forms of matrices, such as [[Jordan canonical form]].

In some approaches to [[noncommutative geometry]], the free noncommutative algebra (polynomials in non-commuting variables) plays a similar role, but the analysis is much more difficult.

==Weights==
{{main|Weight (representation theory)}}
[[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors]] can be generalized to algebra representations.

The generalization of an [[eigenvalue]] of an algebra representation is, rather than a single scalar, a one-dimensional representation &lt;math&gt;\lambda\colon\ A \to R&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., an algebra homomorphism from the algebra to its underlying ring: a [[linear functional]] that is also multiplicative).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Note that for a field, the endomorphism algebra of a one-dimensional vector space (a line) is canonically equal to the underlying field: End(''L'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''K''', since all endomorphisms are scalar multiplication; there is thus no loss in restricting to concrete maps to the base field, rather than to abstract 1-dimensional representations. For rings there are also maps to quotients rings, which need not factor through maps to the ring itself, but again abstract 1-dimensional modules are not needed.&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as a [[Weight (representation theory)|weight]], and the analog of an eigenvector and eigenspace are called ''weight vector'' and ''weight space''.

The case of the eigenvalue of a single operator corresponds to the algebra &lt;math&gt;R[T],&lt;/math&gt; and a map of algebras &lt;math&gt;R[T] \to R&lt;/math&gt; is determined by which scalar it maps the generator ''T'' to. A weight vector for an algebra representation is a vector such that any element of the algebra maps this vector to a multiple of itself – a one-dimensional submodule (subrepresentation). As the pairing &lt;math&gt;A \times M \to M&lt;/math&gt; is bilinear, "which multiple" is an ''A''-linear functional of ''A'' (an algebra map ''A'' → ''R''), namely the weight. In symbols, a weight vector is a vector &lt;math&gt;m \in M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;am = \lambda(a)m&lt;/math&gt; for all elements &lt;math&gt;a \in A,&lt;/math&gt; for some linear functional &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; – note that on the left, multiplication is the algebra action, while on the right, multiplication is scalar multiplication.

Because a weight is a map to a commutative ring, the map factors through the abelianization of the algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; – equivalently, it vanishes on the [[derived algebra]] – in terms of matrices, if &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is a common eigenvector of operators &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T U v = U T v&lt;/math&gt; (because in both cases it is just multiplication by scalars), so common eigenvectors of an algebra must be in the set on which the algebra acts commutatively (which is annihilated by the derived algebra). Thus of central interest are the free commutative algebras, namely the [[polynomial algebra]]s. In this particularly simple and important case of the polynomial algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}[T_1,\dots,T_k]&lt;/math&gt; in a set of commuting matrices, a weight vector of this algebra is a [[simultaneous eigenvector]] of the matrices, while a weight of this algebra is simply a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-tuple of scalars &lt;math&gt; \lambda = (\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_k)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the eigenvalue of each matrix, and hence geometrically to a point in &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-space. These weights – in particularly their geometry – are of central importance in understanding the [[representation theory of Lie algebras]], specifically the [[Lie algebra representation#Finite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras|finite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras]].

As an application of this geometry, given an algebra that is a quotient of a polynomial algebra on &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; generators, it corresponds geometrically to an [[algebraic variety]] in &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional space, and the weight must fall on the variety – i.e., it satisfies defining equations for the variety. This generalizes the fact that eigenvalues satisfy the characteristic polynomial of a matrix in one variable.

In mathematics, the '''amoeba order''' is the [[partial order]] of open subsets of 2&lt;sup&gt;''ω''&lt;/sup&gt; of measure less than 1/2, ordered by reverse inclusion. Amoeba forcing is [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] with the amoeba order; it adds a measure 1 set of random reals. 

There are several variations, where 2&lt;sup&gt;''ω''&lt;/sup&gt; is replaced by the real numbers or a real vector space or the unit interval, and the number 1/2 is replaced by some positive number&amp;nbsp;''ε''.

The name "amoeba order" come from the fact that a subset in the amoeba order can "engulf" a measure zero set by extending a "[[pseudopod]]" to form a larger subset in the order containing this measure zero set, which is analogous to the way an [[amoeba]] eats food.

The amoeba order satisfies the [[countable chain condition]].

==Biography==
Fiat earned his Ph.D. in 1987 from the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] under the supervision of [[Adi Shamir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=19320}}&lt;/ref&gt; After postdoctoral studies with [[Richard Karp]] and [[Manuel Blum]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], he returned to Israel, taking a faculty position at Tel Aviv University.

==Research==
Many of Fiat's most highly cited publications concern cryptography, including his work with Adi Shamir on [[digital signature]]s (leading to the [[Fiat–Shamir heuristic]] for turning interactive identification protocols into signature schemes).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

With Shamir and [[Uriel Feige]] in 1988, Fiat invented the [[Feige–Fiat–Shamir identification scheme]], a method for using [[public-key cryptography]] to provide [[challenge-response authentication]].

With [[Gerhard Woeginger]], Fiat organized a series of [[Dagstuhl]] workshops on [[Competitive analysis (online algorithm)|competitive analysis]] of [[online algorithm]]s, and together with Woeginger he edited the book ''Online Algorithms: The State of the Art'' (Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1442, Springer-Verlag, 1998). His research papers include methods for applying competitive analysis to [[paging]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1237">In [[algebra]], an '''augmentation''' of an [[associative algebra]] ''A'' over a [[commutative ring]] ''k'' is a ''k''-[[algebra homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;A \to k&lt;/math&gt;, typically denoted by ε. An algebra together with an augmentation is called an '''augmented algebra'''. The kernel of the augmentation is a two-sided ideal called the [[augmentation ideal]] of ''A''.

For example, if &lt;math&gt;A =k[G]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[group algebra]] of a group ''G'', then
:&lt;math&gt;A \to k, \, \sum a_i x_i \mapsto \sum a_i&lt;/math&gt;
is an augmentation. 

If ''A'' is a [[graded algebra]] which is connected, i.e. &lt;math&gt;A_0=k&lt;/math&gt;, then the homomorphism &lt;math&gt;A\to k&lt;/math&gt; which maps an element to its homogeneous component of degree 0 is an augmentation. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;k[x]\to k, \sum a_ix^i \mapsto a_0&lt;/math&gt;
is an augmentation on the [[polynomial ring]] &lt;math&gt;k[x]&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], '''Bochner's formula''' is a statement relating [[harmonic functions]] on a [[Riemannian manifold]] &lt;math&gt; (M, g) &lt;/math&gt; to the [[Ricci curvature]].  The formula is named after the [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] [[Salomon Bochner]].

==Formal statement==
If &lt;math&gt; u \colon M \rightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; is a smooth function, then
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \bigg( \frac{|\nabla u|^2}{2} \bigg) = \langle\nabla\Delta u,\nabla u\rangle + |\nabla^2 u|^2 + \mbox{Ric}(\nabla u, \nabla u)
&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; \nabla u &lt;/math&gt; is the [[gradient]] of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt; g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mbox{Ric} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Ricci curvature|Ricci curvature tensor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \frac{1}{2}|\nabla u| ^2 = |\nabla^2 u|^2 + \mbox{Ric}(\nabla u, \nabla u)
&lt;/math&gt;.
Bochner used this formula to prove the [[Bochner vanishing theorem]].

As a corollary, if &lt;math&gt; (M, g) &lt;/math&gt; is a Riemannian manifold without boundary and &lt;math&gt; u \colon M \rightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; is a smooth, compactly supported function, then
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_M (\Delta u)^2 \, d\mbox{vol} = \int_M \Big( |\nabla^2 u|^2 + \mbox{Ric}(\nabla u, \nabla u) \Big) \, d\mbox{vol}
&lt;/math&gt;.
This immediately follows from the first identity, observing that the integral of the left-hand side vanishes (by the [[divergence theorem]]) and integrating by parts the first term on the right-hand side.

'''Bruce E. Sagan''' (born March 29, 1954, Chicago, Illinois) is a Professor of Mathematics at [[Michigan State University]].  He specializes in enumerative, algebraic, and topological [[combinatorics]].  He is also known as a musician, playing music from [[Scandinavia]] and the [[The Balkans|Balkans]].

==Early life==

Bruce Eli Sagan is the son of Eugene Benjamin Sagan and [[Arlene Kaufmann Sagan]].  He grew up in [[Berkeley, California]].  He started playing classical violin at a young age under the influence of his mother who was a music teacher and conductor.  He received his B.S. in mathematics (1974) from [[California State University, East Bay]] (then called California State University, Hayward).  He received his Ph.D. in mathematics (1979) from [[M.I.T.]] His doctoral thesis "Partially Ordered Sets with Hooklengths - an Algorithmic Approach" was supervised by [[Richard P. Stanley]].  He was Stanley's third doctoral student.  During his graduate school years he also joined and became music director of the [[Mandala folk dance ensemble|Mandala Folkdance Ensemble]].

==Mathematical career==

Sagan held postdoctoral positions at [[Université Louis Pasteur]] (1979–1980), the [[University of Michigan]] (1980–1983), [[University College of Wales, Aberystwyth]], [[Middlebury College]] (1984–1985), the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Université du Québec à Montréal]] (Fall, 1985), before becoming a faculty member at MSU in the Spring of 1986.  He has held visiting positions at the [[Institute for Mathematics and its Applications]] (Spring, 1988), [[UCSD]] (Spring, 1991),  the [[Royal Institute of Technology]]  (1993–1994), [[MSRI]] (Winter, 1997), the [[Isaac Newton Institute]] (Winter, 2001), [[Mittag-Leffler Institute]] (Spring, 2005), and [[DIMACS]] (2005–2006).  He was also a rotating Program Officer at the [[National Science Foundation]] (2007–2010).&lt;ref name=cv&gt;Bruce Sagan, [http://www.math.msu.edu/~sagan/Memos/vitae.pdf professional CV]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan has published almost 100 research papers.  He has given over 200 talks in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.  These have included keynote addresses at the Conference on Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (2006) and the British Combinatorial Conference (2011).  He has graduated 9 Ph.D. students.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; During his time at Michigan State University, he has won two awards for teaching excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The J.S.

==Musical career==

Sagan plays music from the Scandinavian countries and the Balkans on fiddle and native instruments.  These include the Swedish [[nyckelharpa]], the Norwegian [[hardingfele]], and the Bulgarian [[gadulka]].  In 1985 he and his then wife, Judy Barlas, founded the music and dance camp Scandinavian Week at Buffalo Gap (now known as Nordic Fiddles and Feet).  He is currently a regular staff member at Northern Week at Ashokan run by [[Jay Ungar]] and [[Molly Mason]].  In 1994 he was awarded the [[Zorn Medal]] in Bronze for his playing in front of a jury of Swedish musicians.  He has performed and given workshops in North America, Europe, and Australia.  He plays Swedish music as a duo with Brad Battey and also with lydia ievins.  His trio Veselba, with Nan Nelson and Chris Rietz, performs music from Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=SingOut1&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Sing Out!]] | title = Bruce Sagan &amp; Lydia Ievens: Northlands |

In [[quantum error correction]], '''CSS codes''', named after their inventors, [[Robert Calderbank]], [[Peter Shor]] and [[Andrew Steane]], are a special type of [[Stabilizer code]]s constructed from classical codes with some special properties.

== Construction ==

Let &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; be two (classical) &lt;math&gt; [n,k_1]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; [n,k_2]&lt;/math&gt; codes such, that &lt;math&gt; C_2 \subset C_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; C_1 , C_2^\perp&lt;/math&gt; both have [[Block code|minimal distance]] &lt;math&gt; \geq 2t+1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; C_2^\perp&lt;/math&gt; is the code [[Dual code|dual]] to &lt;math&gt; C_2&lt;/math&gt;. Then define &lt;math&gt; \text{CSS}(C_1,C_2)&lt;/math&gt;, the CSS code of &lt;math&gt; C_1&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt; C_2&lt;/math&gt; as an &lt;math&gt; [n,k_1 - k_2, d]&lt;/math&gt; code, with &lt;math&gt; d \geq 2t+1 &lt;/math&gt; as follows: 

Define for &lt;math&gt; x \in C_1 : {{|}} x + C_2 \rangle  := &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; 1 / \sqrt{ {{|}} C_2 {{|}} } &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \sum_{y \in C_2} {{|}} x + y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; + &lt;/math&gt; is bitwise addition modulo 2. Then &lt;math&gt; \text{CSS}(C_1,C_2) &lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt; \{ {{|}} x + C_2 \rangle \mid x \in C_1 \} &lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2221">In [[probability theory]], '''Chernoff's distribution''', named after [[Herman Chernoff]], is the [[probability distribution]] of the [[random variable]]

: &lt;math&gt; Z =\underset{s \in \mathbf{R}}{\operatorname{argmax}}\ (W(s) - s^2), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is a "two-sided" [[Wiener process]] (or two-sided "[[Brownian motion]]") satisfying ''W''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  
If

: &lt;math&gt; V(a,c) = \underset{s \in \mathbf{R}}{\operatorname{argmax}} \ (W(s) - c(s-a)^2), &lt;/math&gt;

then ''V''(0,&amp;nbsp;''c'') has density

\text{ as }z \rightarrow \infty
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tilde{a}_1 \approx -2.3381&lt;/math&gt; is the largest zero of the Airy function Ai and where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ai}' (\tilde{a}_1 ) \approx 0.7022&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4612">The '''circulation problem''' and its variants are a generalisation of [[flow network|network flow]] problems, with the added constraint of a lower bound on edge flows, and with '''flow conservation''' also being required for the source and sink (i.e. there are no special nodes). In variants of the problem, there are multiple commodities flowing through the network, and a cost on the flow.

== Definition ==
Given flow network &lt;math&gt;G(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; with:

:&lt;math&gt;l(v,w)&lt;/math&gt;, lower bound on flow from node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to node &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;u(v,w)&lt;/math&gt;, upper bound on flow from node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to node &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;c(v,w)&lt;/math&gt;, cost of a unit of flow on &lt;math&gt;(v,w)&lt;/math&gt;

and the constraints:

:&lt;math&gt;l(v,w) \leq f(v,w) \leq u(v,w)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{w \in V} f(u,w) = 0&lt;/math&gt; (flow cannot appear or disappear in nodes).

Finding a flow assignment satisfying the constraints gives a solution to the given circulation problem. 

In the minimum cost variant of the problem, minimize

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{(v,w) \in E} c(v,w) \cdot f(v,w).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Multi-commodity circulation ===
In a multi-commodity circulation problem, you also need to keep track of the flow of the individual commodities:

:{|
| &lt;math&gt;\,f_i(v,w)&lt;/math&gt; || The flow of commodity &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\,f(v,w) = \sum_i f_i(v,w)&lt;/math&gt; || The total flow.
|}

There is also a lower bound on each flow of commodity.

:{|
| &lt;math&gt;\,l_i(v,w) \leq f_i(v,w)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The conservation constraint must be upheld individually for the commodities: 

:&lt;math&gt;\ \sum_{w \in V} f_i(u,w) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

== Solution ==
For the circulation problem, many polynomial algorithms have been developed (e.g., [[Edmonds-Karp algorithm|Edmonds and Karp algorithm]], 1972; Tarjan 1987-1988). Tardos found the first strongly polynomial algorithm.&lt;ref name="Ta85"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Éva Tardos | title = A strongly polynomial minimum cost circulation algorithm | journal = Combinatorica | volume = 5 | pages = 247–255 | doi = 10.1007/BF02579369}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;!-- which articles? --&gt;

For the case of multiple commodities, the problem is [[NP-complete]] for integer flows.&lt;ref name="EIS76"&gt;{{cite journal | author = S. Even and A. Itai and A. Shamir | title = On the complexity of time table and multi-commodity flow problems | publisher = SIAM | year = 1976 | journal = SIAM Journal on Computing | volume = 5 | pages = 691–703 | url = http://link.aip.org/link/?SMJ/5/691/1 | doi = 10.1137/0205048 | issue = 4 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130112133748/http://link.aip.org/link/?SMJ/5/691/1 | archivedate = 2013-01-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For fractional flows, it is solvable in [[polynomial time]], as one can formulate the problem as a [[linear programming|linear program]].

* Minimum cost circulation problem - Use a single commodity
* Multi-commodity circulation - Solve without optimising cost.
* Simple circulation - Just use one commodity, and no cost.

Let &lt;math&gt;l_i(u,v)=0&lt;/math&gt; for all other edges.
* [[Minimum cost multi-commodity flow problem]] - As above, but minimize the cost.
* [[Minimum cost flow problem]] - As above, with 1 commodity.
* [[Maximum flow problem]] - Set all costs to 0, and add an edge from the sink &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to the source &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;l(t,s)=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u(t,s)=&lt;/math&gt;∞ and &lt;math&gt;c(t,s)=-1&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Minimum cost maximum flow problem]] - First find the maximum flow amount &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. Then solve with &lt;math&gt;l(t,s)=u(t,s)=m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c(t,s)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Shortest path problem|Single-source shortest path]] - Let &lt;math&gt;l(u,v)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c(u,v)=1&lt;/math&gt; for all edges in the graph, and add an edge &lt;math&gt;(t,s)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;l(t,s)=c(t,s)=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a(t,s)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Shortest path problem|All-pairs shortest path]] - Let all capacities be unlimited, and find a flow of 1 for &lt;math&gt;v(v-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; commodities, one for each pair of nodes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5899">In [[mathematics]], a '''Colombeau algebra''' is an [[associative algebra|algebra]] of a certain kind containing the space of [[distribution (mathematics)|Schwartz distributions]]. While in classical distribution theory a general multiplication of distributions is not possible, Colombeau algebras provide a rigorous framework for this.

Such a multiplication of distributions has long been believed to be impossible because of L. Schwartz' impossibility result, which basically states that there cannot be a differential algebra containing the space of distributions and preserving the product of continuous functions. However, if one only wants to preserve the product of smooth functions instead such a construction becomes possible, as demonstrated first by Colombeau.

As a mathematical tool, Colombeau algebras can be said to combine a treatment of singularities, differentiation and nonlinear operations in one framework, lifting the limitations of distribution theory. These algebras have found numerous applications in the fields of partial differential equations, geophysics, microlocal analysis and general relativity so far.

== Schwartz' impossibility result ==

Attempting to embed the space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; of distributions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; into an associative algebra &lt;math&gt;(A(\mathbb{R}), \circ, +)&lt;/math&gt;, the following requirements seem to be natural:

# &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; is linearly embedded into &lt;math&gt;A(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; such that the constant function &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; becomes the unity in &lt;math&gt;A(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;,
# There is a partial derivative operator &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;A(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; which is linear and satisfies the Leibniz rule,
# the restriction of &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the usual partial derivative,
# the restriction of &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{R}) \times C(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the pointwise product.

However, L. Schwartz' result&lt;ref&gt;L. Schwartz, 1954, "Sur l'impossibilité de la multiplication des distributions", ''Comptes Rendus de L'Académie des Sciences'' 239, pp. 847–848 [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3191m/f847.image.langFR]&lt;/ref&gt; implies that these requirements cannot hold simultaneously. The same is true even if, in 4., one replaces &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;C^k(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;, the space of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; times continuously differentiable functions. While this result has often been interpreted as saying that a general multiplication of distributions is not possible, in fact it only states that one cannot unrestrictedly combine differentiation, multiplication of continuous functions and the presence of singular objects like the Dirac delta.

Colombeau algebras are constructed to satisfy conditions 1.–3. and a condition like 4., but with &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{R}) \times C(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; replaced by &lt;math&gt;C^\infty(\mathbb{R}) \times C^\infty(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., they preserve the product of smooth (infinitely differentiable) functions only.

== Basic idea ==

It is defined as a [[quotient algebra]]

:&lt;math&gt;C^\infty_M(\mathbb{R}^n)/C^\infty_N(\mathbb{R}^n).&lt;/math&gt;

Here the ''moderate functions'' on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; are defined as

:&lt;math&gt;C^\infty_M(\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt;

which are families (''f&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;'') of [[smooth function]]s on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;{f:} \mathbb{R}_+ \to C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt;

(where '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(0,∞)) is the set of "[[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]]" indices, and for all compact subsets ''K'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and [[multiindices]] α we have ''N'' &gt; 0 such that

:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{x\in K}\left|\frac{\partial^{|\alpha|}}{(\partial x_1)^{\alpha_1}\cdots(\partial x_n)^{\alpha_n}}f_\varepsilon(x)\right| = O(\varepsilon^{-N})\qquad(\varepsilon\to 0).&lt;/math&gt;

The [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] 
&lt;math&gt;C^\infty_N(\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt;
of ''negligible functions'' is defined in the same way but with the partial derivatives instead bounded by O(''ε&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;'') for '''all''' ''N'' &gt; 0.

An introduction to Colombeau Algebras is given in here 
&lt;ref&gt;Gratus J., Colombeau Algebra: A pedagogical introduction 
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0257 arXiv:1308.0257]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Embedding of distributions ==
The space(s) of [[Schwartz distribution]]s can be embedded into this ''simplified'' algebra by (component-wise) [[convolution]] with any element of the algebra having as representative a ''[[e-net (probability theory)|&amp;delta;-net]]'', i.e. such that &lt;math&gt;\phi_\varepsilon\to\delta&lt;/math&gt; in '' D' '' as ε→0.

This embedding is non-canonical, because it depends on the choice of the δ-net. However, there are versions of Colombeau algebras (so called ''full'' algebras) which allow for canonical embeddings of distributions. A well known ''full'' version is obtained by adding the mollifiers as second indexing set.

'''Configurable modularity''' is a term coined by Raoul de Campo of [[IBM Research]] and later expanded on by [[Nate Edwards]] of the same organization, denoting the ability to reuse independent components by changing their interconnections, but not their internals.&lt;ref&gt;N.P. Edwards, ''On the Architectural Requirements of an Engineered System'', IBM Research Report, RC 6688 (#28797), T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, 8/18/1977&lt;/ref&gt;  In Edwards' view this characterizes all successful reuse systems, and indeed all systems which can be described as "engineered".

D-Wave is the world's first company to sell computers which exploit quantum effects in their operation.&lt;ref name=ExTech2011&gt;{{cite web|title=First Ever Commercial Quantum Computer Now Available for $10 Million|url=http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,2385665,00.asp|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Whether these qualify as "[[quantum computers]]" in the sense generally understood is hotly disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1400|title=D-Wave: Truth finally starts to emerge}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The D-Wave One was built on early prototypes such as D-Wave's Orion Quantum Computer. The prototype was a 16-[[qubit]] [[quantum annealing]] processor, demonstrated on February 13, 2007, at the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]].&lt;ref name=announcement /&gt; D-Wave demonstrated what they claimed to be a 28-qubit quantum annealing processor on November 12, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwavesys.com/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=9&amp;cntnt01origid=15&amp;cntnt01returnid=21|title=D-Wave Systems News|work=dwavesys.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chip was fabricated at the NASA [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] Microdevices Lab in Pasadena, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwave.wordpress.com/2007/11/09/a-picture-of-the-demo-chip/|title=A picture of the demo chip|work=Hack The Multiverse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying ideas for the D-Wave approach arose from experimental results in [[condensed matter physics]], and in particular work on quantum annealing in magnets performed by Dr. Gabriel Aeppli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brooke |first1=J. |title=Quantum Annealing of a Disordered Magnet |journal=Science |date=30 April 1999 |volume=284 |issue=5415 |pages=779–781 |doi=10.1126/science.284.5415.779|bibcode=1999Sci...284..779B |arxiv=cond-mat/0105238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas were later recast in the language of quantum computation by MIT physicists Ed Farhi, Seth Lloyd, Terry Orlando and Bill Kaminsky, whose publications in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=quant-ph/0001106|last1=Farhi|first1=Edward|title=Quantum Computation by Adiabatic Evolution|last2=Goldstone|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Gutmann|first3=Sam|last4=Sipser|first4=Michael|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=quant-ph/0403090|last1=Kaminsky|first1=William M|title=Scalable Superconducting Architecture for Adiabatic Quantum Computation|last2=Lloyd|first2=Seth|last3=Orlando|first3=Terry P|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided both a theoretical model for quantum computation that fit with the earlier work in quantum magnetism (specifically the adiabatic quantum computing model and quantum annealing, its finite temperature variant), and a specific enablement of that idea using superconducting flux qubits which is a close cousin to the designs D-Wave produced. In order to understand the origins of much of the controversy around the D-Wave approach, it is important to note that the origins of the D-Wave approach to quantum computation arose not from the conventional quantum information field, but from experimental condensed matter physics.

On May 11, 2011, D-Wave Systems announced [[D-Wave One]], described as "the world's first commercially available quantum computer", operating on a 128-[[qubit]] [[chipset]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=M.

== History ==
D-Wave was founded by Haig Farris (former chair of board), Geordie Rose (CTO and former CEO), Bob Wiens (former CFO), and Alexandre Zagoskin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/physics/staff/dr-alexandre-zagoskin.html|title=Department staff - Dr Alexandre Zagoskin - Physics - Loughborough University|work=lboro.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; (former VP Research and Chief Scientist). Farris taught a business course at the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC), where Rose obtained his [[Ph.D.]], and Zagoskin was a [[postdoctoral fellow]]. The company name refers to their first qubit designs, which used [[high-temperature superconductor|d-wave]] superconductors.

D-Wave operated as an offshoot from UBC, while maintaining ties with the Department of Physics and Astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.ubc.ca|title=UBC Physics &amp; Astronomy -|work=ubc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; It funded academic research in [[quantum computing]], thus building a collaborative network of research scientists. The company collaborated with several universities and institutions, including [[UBC]], [[IPHT Jena]], [[Université de Sherbrooke]], [[University of Toronto]], [[University of Twente]], [[Chalmers University of Technology]], [[University of Erlangen]], and [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]. These partnerships were listed on D-Wave's website until 2005.&lt;ref name="WayBackMachine2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwavesys.com/ |title=D-Wave Systems at the Way Back Machine|date=2002-11-23|accessdate=2007-02-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20021123181006/http://dwavesys.com/ |archivedate = 2002-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WayBackMachine2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwavesys.com/ |title=D-Wave Systems at the Way Back Machine|date=2005-03-24|accessdate=2007-02-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050324003119/http://dwavesys.com/ |archivedate = 2005-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, D-Wave announced a new quantum applications ecosystem with computational finance firm [[1QB Information Technologies (1QBit)]] and cancer research group DNA-SEQ to focus on solving real-world problems with quantum hardware.&lt;ref name="Quantum Applications Ecosystem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwavesys.com/press-releases/d-wave-systems-building-quantum-application-ecosystem-announces-partnerships-dna-seq|title=D-Wave Systems Building Quantum Application Ecosystem, Announces Partnerships with DNA-SEQ Alliance and 1QBit|accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D-Wave operated from various locations in Vancouver, British Columbia, and laboratory spaces at UBC before moving to its current location in the neighboring suburb of Burnaby. D-Wave also has offices in Palo Alto and Vienna, USA.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

=== Orion prototype ===
On February 13, 2007, D-Wave demonstrated the Orion system, running three different applications at the [[Computer History Museum|Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California]]. This marked the first public demonstration of, supposedly, a quantum computer and associated service.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The first application, an example of [[pattern matching]], performed a search for a similar compound to a known drug within a database of [[molecules]]. The next application computed a seating arrangement for an event subject to compatibilities and incompatibilities between guests. The last involved solving a [[Sudoku]] puzzle.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The processors at the heart of D-Wave's "Orion quantum computing system" are designed for use as [[hardware acceleration|hardware accelerator]] processors rather than general-purpose computer [[microprocessor]]s. The system is designed to solve a particular [[NP-complete]] problem related to the two dimensional [[Ising model]] in a [[magnetic field]].&lt;ref name=announcement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwave.wordpress.com/2007/01/19/quantum-computing-demo-announcement/|title=Quantum Computing Demo Announcement|date=2007-01-19|accessdate=2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; D-Wave terms the device a 16-[[qubit]] [[superconducting]] [[Adiabatic process (quantum mechanics)|adiabatic]] [[quantum computer]] processor.&lt;ref name=adiabatic&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Scalable Architecture for Adiabatic Quantum Computing of NP-Hard Problems|author2 = William M.

According to the company, a conventional front end running an application that requires the solution of an NP-complete problem, such as pattern matching, passes the problem to the Orion system.

According to Geordie Rose, founder and Chief Technology Officer of D-Wave, NP-complete problems "are probably not exactly solvable, no matter how big, fast or advanced computers get"; the adiabatic quantum computer used by the Orion system is intended to quickly compute an approximate solution.&lt;ref name=NP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwave.wordpress.com/2006/08/27/yeah-but-how-fast-is-it-part-3-or-some-thoughts-about-adiabatic-qc/ |title=Yeah but how fast is it?

==== 2009 Google demonstration ====
On December 8, 2009, at the Neural Information Processing Systems ([[Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems|NIPS]]) conference, a Google research team led by [[Hartmut Neven]] used D-Wave's processor to train a binary image classifier.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

=== D-Wave One ===
On May 11, 2011, D-Wave Systems announced the D-Wave One, an integrated quantum computer system running on a 128-qubit processor. The processor used in the D-Wave One code-named "Rainier", performs a single mathematical operation, [[discrete optimization]]. Rainier uses quantum annealing to solve optimization problems. The D-Wave One is claimed to be the world's first commercially available quantum computer system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning to program the D-Wave One|url=http://dwave.wordpress.com/2011/05/11/learning-to-program-the-d-wave-one/|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The price is approximately [[US$]]10,000,000.&lt;ref name=ExTech2011 /&gt;

A research team led by Matthias Troyer and [[Daniel Lidar]] found that, while there is evidence of quantum annealing in D-Wave One, they saw no speed increase compared to classical computers. They implemented an optimized classical algorithm to solve the same particular problem as the D-Wave One.&lt;ref name="aaronson-truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature2014Troyer"&gt;{{Cite journal|date={{date|2013-04-16}} |title=Quantum annealing with more than one hundred qubits |journal=Nature Physics |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=218–224 |arxiv=1304.4595|last1=Boixo |first1=Sergio |last2= Rønnow |first2=Troels F. |last3= Isakov |first3=Sergei V. |last4=Wang |first4=Zhihui |last5=Wecker |first5=David |last6= Lidar |first6=Daniel A. |last7= Martinis |first7=John M. |last8=Troyer |first8=Matthias |doi=10.1038/nphys2900 |bibcode=2014NatPh..10..218B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lockheed Martin and D-Wave collaboration ====
On May 25, 2011, [[Lockheed Martin]] signed a multi-year contract with D-Wave Systems to realize the benefits based upon a quantum annealing processor applied to some of Lockheed's most challenging computation problems. The contract included purchase of the D-Wave One quantum computer, maintenance, and associated professional services.&lt;ref name="Lockheed Martin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lockheed Martin Signs Contract with D-Wave Systems|url=http://www.nanotech-now.com/news.cgi?story_id=42543}}Retrieved 2011-05-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Optimization problem-solving in protein structure determination ====
In August 2012, a team of Harvard University researchers presented results of the largest protein-folding problem solved to date using a quantum computer. The researchers solved instances of a lattice protein folding model, known as the [[Miyazawa–Jernigan model]], on a D-Wave One quantum computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/08/d-wave-quantum-computer-solves-protein-folding-problem.html|title=D-Wave quantum computer solves protein folding problem|work=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2012-08-d-wave-quantum-method-protein-problem.html|title=D-Wave uses quantum method to solve protein folding problem|work=phys.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== D-Wave Two ===
{{Main|D-Wave Two}}
In early 2012, D-Wave Systems revealed a 512-qubit quantum computer, code-named ''Vesuvius'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/02/dwave-quantum-cloud/all/1|title=D-Wave Defies World of Critics With 'First Quantum Cloud' - WIRED|date=22 February 2012|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was launched as a production processor in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/canada-competes/the-black-box-that-could-change-the-world/article5327613/?page=1|title=The black box that could change the world|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, [[Catherine McGeoch]], a consultant for D-Wave, published the first comparison of the technology against regular top-end desktop computers running an optimization algorithm. Using a configuration with 439 qubits, the system performed 3,600 times as fast as [[CPLEX]], the best algorithm on the conventional machine, solving problems with 100 or more variables in half a second compared with half an hour. The results are presented at the Computing Frontiers 2013 conference.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013 several groups of researchers at the Adiabatic Quantum Computing workshop at the [[Institute of Physics]] in London produced evidence, though only indirect, of [[quantum entanglement]] in the D-Wave chips.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 it was announced that a collaboration between NASA, Google and the USRA launched a Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division at [[Ames Research Center]] in California, using a 512-qubit D-Wave Two that would be used for research into machine learning, among other fields of study.&lt;ref name=MITreview /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bits_GoogleBuysQuanum&gt;{{cite web|last=Hardy|first=Quentin|title=Google Buys a Quantum Computer|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/google-buys-a-quantum-computer/|work=Bits|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== D-Wave 2X and D-Wave 2000Q ===
On August 20, 2015, D-Wave released general availability of their D-Wave 2X computer, with 1,000 qubits in a [[Chimera graph]] architecture (although, due to magnetic offsets and manufacturing variability inherent in the superconductor circuit fabrication fewer than 1,152 qubits are functional and available for use. The exact number of qubits yielded will vary with each specific processor manufactured.) This was accompanied by a report comparing speeds with high-end single threaded CPUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1508.05087|last1=King|first1=James|title=Benchmarking a quantum annealing processor with the time-to-target metric|last2=Yarkoni|first2=Sheir|last3=Nevisi|first3=Mayssam M|last4=Hilton|first4=Jeremy P|last5=McGeoch|first5=Catherine C|class=quant-ph|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous reports, this one explicitly stated that question of quantum speedup was not something they were trying to address, and focused on constant-factor performance gains over classical hardware. For general-purpose problems, a speedup of 15x was reported, but it is worth noting that these classical algorithms benefit efficiently from parallelization—so that the computer would be performing on par with, perhaps, 30 high-end single-threaded cores.

The D-Wave 2X processor is based on a 2,048-qubit chip with half of the qubits disabled; these were activated in the D-Wave 2000Q.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=Zdd88aC0VwA|title=The Future Of Quantum Computing: Vern Brownell, D-Wave CEO @ Compute Midwest}} 4 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nextbigfuture.com/2014/10/dwave-systems-shows-off-quantum-chip.html|title=Next Big Future: Dwave Systems shows off quantum chip with 2048 physical qubits|author=brian wang|work=nextbigfuture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In 2007 [[Umesh Vazirani]], a professor at [[University of California]] (UC) [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], made the following criticism:&lt;ref name="Aaronson-and-Vazirani-on-Orion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=225|title=Shtetl-Optimized: D-Wave Easter Spectacular|date=2007-04-07|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text="Their claimed speedup over classical algorithms appears to be based on a misunderstanding of a paper my colleagues van Dam, [[Michele Mosca|Mosca]] and I wrote on "The power of adiabatic quantum computing." That speed up unfortunately does not hold in the setting at hand, and therefore D-Wave's "quantum computer" even if it turns out to be a true quantum computer, and even if it can be scaled to thousands of qubits, would likely not be more powerful than a cell phone."}}

Wim van Dam, a professor at UC [[University of California, Santa Barbara|Santa Barbara]], summarized his opinion as of 2008 in the journal ''Nature Physics'':&lt;ref name="van-Dam-Nature"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Dam |first1=Wim |title=In the 'death zone'? |journal=Nature Physics |date=1 April 2007 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=220–221 |doi=10.1038/nphys585 |bibcode=2007NatPh...3..220V}}&lt;/ref&gt; "At the moment it is impossible to say if D-Wave's quantum computer is intrinsically equivalent to a classical computer or not. So until more is known about their error rates, ''caveat emptor'' is the least one can say".

An article in the May 12, 2011, edition of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' gives details which critical academics say proves that the company's chips do have some of the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] properties needed for quantum computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=M.

Former [[MIT]] professor [[Scott Aaronson]], who has described himself as "Chief D-Wave Skeptic", said that D-Wave's 2007 demonstration did not prove anything about the workings of the Orion computer, and that its marketing claims were deceptive.&lt;ref name="Aaronson-Orion-Anti-Hype-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=198|title=Shtetl-Optimized: The Orion Quantum Computer Anti-Hype FAQ|date=2007-02-09|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 he said that he was "retiring as Chief D-Wave Skeptic",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=639|title=Shtetl-Optimized|work=scottaaronson.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reporting his "skeptical but positive" views based on a visit to D-Wave in February 2012. Aaronson said that one of the most important reasons for his new position on D-Wave was the 2011 Nature article.&lt;ref name="sandwich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Latest-Criticisms-from-Aaronson-to-D-Wave"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=291#comments|title=Shtetl-Optimized: Thanksgiving Special: D-Wave at MIT|date=2007-11-22|accessdate=2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="In-Defence-Of-D-Wave"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pontiff/2009/12/in_defense_of_d-wave.php|title = In Defence of D-Wave}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 16, 2013 he resumed his skeptic post. He criticizes D-Wave for blowing results out of proportion on press releases that claim speedups of three orders of magnitude, in light of a paper&lt;ref name="Nature2014Troyer" /&gt; by scientists from [[ETH Zurich]] reporting a 128-qubit D-Wave computer being outperformed by a factor of 15 using regular digital computers and applying classical [[metaheuristics]] (particularly [[simulated annealing]]) to the problem that D-Wave's computer was specifically designed to solve.&lt;ref name="aaronson-truth"&gt;{{cite web |author=Scott Aaronson |date={{date|2013-05-16}} |title=D-Wave: Truth finally starts to emerge |url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1400 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 2013, NASA and Google, together with a consortium of universities, announced a partnership with D-Wave to investigate how D-Wave's computers could be used in the creation of artificial intelligence. Prior to announcing this partnership, NASA, Google, and Universities Space Research Association put a D-Wave computer through a series of benchmark and acceptance tests, which it passed.&lt;ref name=MITreview /&gt; Independent researchers found that D-Wave's computers could solve some problems as much as 3,600 times faster than particular software packages running on conventional digital computers.&lt;ref name=MITreview /&gt; Other independent researchers found that different software packages running on a single core of a desktop computer can solve those same problems as fast or faster than D-Wave's computers (at least 12,000 times faster for [[quadratic assignment problem]]s, and between 1 and 50 times faster for [[quadratic unconstrained binary optimization]] problems).&lt;ref name="D-Wave-comment-on-comparison-with-classical-computers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archduke.org/stuff/d-wave-comment-on-comparison-with-classical-computers|title=D-Wave: comment on comparison with classical computers|date=2013-06-10|accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, researchers at UC Berkeley and [[IBM]] published a classical model reproducing the D-Wave machine's observed behavior, suggesting that it may not be a quantum computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|last=Shin|first=Seung Woo|title=How 'Quantum' is the D-Wave Machine?|eprint=1401.7087 |author2=Graeme Smith |author3=John A. Smolin |author4=Umesh Vazirani|date=28 January 2014|class=quant-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, researchers at [[University College London]] and the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) published a paper comparing data obtained from a D-Wave Two computer with three possible explanations from classical physics and one quantum model. They found that their quantum model was a better fit to the experimental data than the Shin–Smith–Smolin–Vazirani classical model, and a much better fit than any of the other classical models. The authors conclude that "This suggests that an open system quantum dynamical description of the D-Wave device is well-justified even in the presence of relevant thermal excitations and fast single-qubit decoherence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1403.4228|last1=Albash|first1=Tameem|title=Consistency Tests of Classical and Quantum Models for a Quantum Annealer|journal=Physical Review A|volume=91|issue=4|last2=Vinci|first2=Walter|last3=Mishra|first3=Anurag|last4=Warburton|first4=Paul A|last5=Lidar|first5=Daniel A|year=2014|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.91.042314|bibcode=2015PhRvA..91d2314A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, researchers at D-Wave, Google, USC, [[Simon Fraser University]], and National Research [[Tomsk Polytechnic University]] published a paper containing experimental results that demonstrated the presence of entanglement among D-Wave qubits. Qubit tunneling spectroscopy was used to measure the energy [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors#Eigenspace and spectrum|eigenspectrum]] of two and eight-qubit systems, demonstrating their coherence during a critical portion of the quantum annealing procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://journals.aps.org/prx/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.021041|title=Verification Required|volume=4|issue=2|work=aps.org|doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.4.021041|year=2014|last1=Lanting|first1=T.|last2=Przybysz|first2=A.

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; described as "likely the most thorough and precise study that has been done on the performance of the D-Wave machine"&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Katzgraber, quoted in {{Harv|Cho|2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the fairest comparison yet",{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} attempted to define and measure quantum speedup. Several definitions were put forward as some may be unverifiable by empirical tests, while others, though falsified, would nonetheless allow for the existence of performance advantages. The researchers, led by Matthias Troyer at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich]], said that they found "no quantum speedup" across the entire range of their tests, and only inconclusive results when looking at subsets of the tests. Further work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1503.04216|last1=Amin|first1=Mohammad|title=Searching for quantum speedup in quasistatic quantum annealers|journal=Physical Review A|volume=92|issue=5|year=2015|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.92.052323|bibcode=2015PhRvA..92e2323A}}&lt;/ref&gt; has advanced understanding of these test metrics and their reliance on equilibrated systems.
There remain open questions regarding quantum speedup. The ETH reference in the previous section is just for one class of benchmark problems. Potentially
there may be other classes of problems where quantum speedup might occur. Researchers at Google, NASA, LANL, USC, Texas

Suter attended a number of different colleges, not graduating from any of them.&lt;ref name=Lyman /&gt;  Drafted into the [[U.S. Army|Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]], he spent his deployment in [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name=Lyman /&gt; t
Upon returning to the U.S., Suter got work at ''The Washington Post'' as an illustrator, for a while working as a [[courtroom artist]] during the [[Watergate scandal]] trials.&lt;ref name=Jenkins1 /&gt;

Suter was awarded a [[Michigan Journalism Fellowship]] in 1977, where he spent a year studying fine art, philosophy, and history&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mjfellows.org/fellows/1978.html "Past Fellows: 1977–1978,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028152543/http://www.mjfellows.org/fellows/1978.html |date=2015-10-28 }} Knight-Wallace Fellows at Michigan website. Accessed Dec. 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Michigan]]. Upon completion of the fellowship, in 1978, Suter moved to New York City to pursue editorial illustration full-time. He quickly become sought-after by such publications as ''The New York Times'' (both on the [[op-ed page]] and [[The New York Times Book Review|the book review]]), ''Time'' magazine (for whom he did a number of covers), ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name=3x3 /&gt;

In a mid-1980s magazine profile, Suter described his work this way:
{{cquote|I don't think of them as puns. I like to think of them as equations. Every story suggests a certain number of images. And then there are other images, the visual clichés that are in everybody's mind and sort of make up their mental scenery, like [[the Pentagon]], the [[Statue of Liberty]], or the [[Christian cross|Cross]]. My mind is like a [[slot machine]]: You pull the lever and eventually one of the images from the article comes to rest next to a cliché that looks something like it. . . . It's a little like [[algebra]]. I try to combine the two images through a process of finding similarities and canceling out dissimilar aspects.&lt;ref name=People /&gt;}}

For many years, Suter has been working on creating a full-length animation of the complete text of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''.&lt;ref name=Lyman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kraus&gt;Kraus, Jerelle. ''All the Art That's Fit to Print (And Some That Wasn't): Inside The New York Times Op-Ed Page'' (Columbia University Press, 2013), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 2000s he retired from editorial illustration to work full-time on his painting and sculpture practices.

In [[geometry]], a striking feature of [[projective plane]]s is the [[symmetry]] of the roles played by [[Point (geometry)|points]] and [[Line (geometry)|lines]] in the definitions and theorems, and ([[plane (geometry)|plane]]) '''duality''' is the formalization of this concept. There are two approaches to the subject of duality, one through language ({{section link||Principle of duality}}) and the other a more functional approach through special [[Map (mathematics)|mappings]]. These are completely equivalent and either treatment has as its starting point the [[axiomatic]] version of the geometries under consideration. In the functional approach there is a map between related geometries that is called a '''''duality'''''. Such a map can be constructed in many ways. The concept of plane duality readily extends to space duality and beyond that to duality in any finite-dimensional [[projective geometry]].

== Principle of duality ==
A [[projective plane]] {{math|''C''}} may be defined axiomatically as an [[incidence structure]], in terms of a set {{math|''P''}} of ''points'', a set {{math|''L''}} of ''lines'', and an [[incidence relation]] {{math|I}} that determines which points lie on which lines. These sets can be used to define a '''plane dual structure'''.

Interchange the role of "points" and "lines" in  
:{{math|1=''C'' = (''P'', ''L'', I)}}
to obtain the ''dual structure''
:{{math|1=''C''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; = (''L'', ''P'', I&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;)}},
where {{math|I&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the [[inverse relation]] of {{math|I}}. {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is also a projective plane, called the '''dual plane''' of {{math|''C''}}.

If {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} are isomorphic, then {{math|''C''}} is called '''''self-dual'''''. The projective planes {{math|PG(2, ''K'')}} for any field (or, more generally, for every [[division ring]](skewfield) isomorphic to its dual) {{math|''K''}} are self-dual. In particular, Desarguesian planes of finite order are always self-dual. However, there are [[non-Desarguesian plane]]s which are not self-dual, such as the Hall planes and some that are, such as the [[Hughes plane]]s.

In a projective plane a statement involving points, lines and incidence between them that is obtained from another such statement by interchanging the words "point" and "line" and making whatever grammatical adjustments that are necessary, is called the '''plane dual statement''' of the first. The plane dual statement of "Two points are on a unique line" is "Two lines meet at a unique point". Forming the plane dual of a statement is known as ''dualizing'' the statement.

If a statement is true in a projective plane {{math|''C''}}, then the plane dual of that statement must be true in the dual plane {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This follows since dualizing each statement in the proof "in {{math|''C''}}" gives a corresponding statement of the proof "in {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}".

The '''''principle of plane duality''''' says that dualizing any theorem in a self-dual projective plane {{math|''C''}} produces another theorem valid in {{math|''C''}}.&lt;ref name=Cox25&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1964|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above concepts can be generalized to talk about space duality, where the terms "points" and "planes" are interchanged (and lines remain lines). This leads to the ''principle of space duality''.&lt;ref name=Cox25 /&gt;

These principles provide a good reason for preferring to use a "symmetric" term for the incidence relation. Thus instead of saying "a point lies on a line" one should say "a point is incident with a line" since dualizing the latter only involves interchanging point and line ("a line is incident with a point").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of the principle of plane duality follows from the axiomatic definition of a projective plane. The three axioms of this definition can be written so that they are self-dual statements implying that the dual of a projective plane is also a projective plane. The dual of a true statement in a projective plane is therefore a true statement in the dual projective plane and the implication is that for self-dual planes, the dual of a true statement in that plane is also a true statement in that plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|page=419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dual theorems===
As the [[real projective plane]], {{math|PG(2, '''R''')}}, is self-dual there are a number of pairs of well known results that are duals of each other. Some of these are:

* [[Desargues' theorem]] ⇔ [[Desargues' theorem|Converse of Desargues' theorem]]
* [[Pascal's theorem]] ⇔ [[Brianchon's theorem]]
* [[Menelaus' theorem]] ⇔ [[Ceva's theorem]]

===Dual configurations===
[[File:Dualquads.svg|thumb|350px|Dual configurations]]
Not only statements, but also systems of points and lines can be dualized.

A set of {{math|''m''}} points and {{math|''n''}} lines is called an {{math|(''m''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} ''[[Configuration (geometry)|configuration]]'' if {{math|''c''}} of the {{math|''n''}} lines pass through each point and {{math|''d''}} of the {{math|''m''}} points lie on each line. The dual of an {{math|(''m''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} configuration, is an {{math|(''n''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} configuration. Thus, the dual of a quadrangle, a (4&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 6&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) configuration of four points and six lines, is a quadrilateral, a (6&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 4&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) configuration of six points and four lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1964|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of all points on a line, called a [[projective range]] has as its dual a [[pencil (mathematics)|pencil of lines]], the set of all lines on a point.

==Duality as a mapping==

===Plane dualities===

A '''plane duality''' is a map from a [[projective plane]] {{math|1=''C'' = (''P'', ''L'', I)}} to its ''dual plane'' {{math|1=''C''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; = (''L'', ''P'', I&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;)}} (see {{section link||Principle of duality}} above) which preserves [[Incidence relation|incidence]]. That is, a plane duality {{math|''σ''}} will map points to lines and lines to points ({{math|1=''P''&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''L''}} and {{math|1=''L''&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''P''}}) in such a way that if a point {{math|''Q''}} is on a line {{math|''m''}} (denoted by {{math|''Q'' I ''m''}}) then {{math|''Q'' I ''m'' ⇔ ''m''&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt; I&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''Q''&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A plane duality which is an isomorphism is called a ''[[Correlation (projective geometry)|correlation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dembowski|1968|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of a correlation means that the projective plane {{math|''C''}} is ''self-dual''.

The projective plane {{math|''C''}} in this definition need not be a [[Desarguesian plane]]. However, if it is, that is, {{math|1=''C'' = PG(2, ''K'')}} with {{math|''K''}} a [[division ring]] (skewfield), then a duality, as defined below for general [[projective space]]s, gives a plane duality on {{math|''C''}} that satisfies the above definition.
&lt;!--
In the special case that the projective plane is of the [[Projective space|PG(2, ''K'')]] type, with ''K'' a division ring, a duality is called a '''reciprocity'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casse|2006|loc=p. 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the [[Fundamental theorem of projective geometry]] a reciprocity is the composition of an [[automorphic function]] of ''K'' and a [[homography]]. If the automorphism involved is the identity, then the reciprocity is called a '''projective correlation'''.

A correlation of order two (an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]) is called a '''polarity'''. If a correlation ''φ'' is not a polarity then ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a nontrivial collineation.

This duality mapping concept can also be extended to higher-dimensional spaces so the modifier "(plane)" can be dropped in those situations.
--&gt;

===In general projective spaces===

A duality {{math|''δ''}} of a [[projective space]] is a [[permutation]] of the subspaces of {{math|PG(''n'', ''K'')}} (also denoted by {{math|''K'''''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} with {{math|''K''}} a [[field (mathematics)|field]] (or more generally a skewfield ([[division ring]])) that reverses inclusion,&lt;ref&gt;Some authors use the term "correlation" for duality, while others, as shall we, use correlation for a certain type of duality.&lt;/ref&gt; that is:
: {{math|''S'' ⊆ ''T''}} implies {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;''δ''&lt;/sup&gt; ⊇ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''δ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for all subspaces {{math|''S'', ''T''}} of {{math|PG(''n'', ''K'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dembowski|1968|page=41}} Dembowski uses the term "correlation" for duality.&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, a duality interchanges objects of dimension {{math|''r''}} with objects of dimension {{math|''n'' − 1 − ''r''}} ( = [[codimension]] {{math|''r'' + 1}}). That is, in a projective space of dimension {{math|''n''}}, the points (dimension 0) correspond to [[hyperplane]]s (codimension 1), the lines joining two points (dimension 1) correspond to the intersection of two hyperplanes (codimension 2), and so on.

====Classification of dualities====
{{hatnote|In this section the traditional geometric terminology of "right (left) vector spaces over skewfields" is used instead of the algebraic terms "[[R-module]]s over a [[division ring]]".}}

The ''dual'' {{math|''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} of a finite-dimensional (right) vector space {{math|''V''}} over a skewfield {{math|''K''}} can be regarded as a (right) vector space of the same dimension over the [[Opposite ring|opposite skewfield]] {{math|''K''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;}}. There is thus an inclusion-reversing bijection between the projective spaces {{math|PG(''n'', ''K'')}} and {{math|PG(''n'', ''K''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. If {{math|''K''}} and {{math|''K''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;}} are isomorphic then there exists a duality on {{math|PG(''n'', ''K'')}}. Conversely, if {{math|PG(''n'', ''K'')}} admits a duality for {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}, then {{math|''K''}} and {{math|''K''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;}} are isomorphic.

Let {{pi}} be a duality of {{math|PG(''n'', ''K'')}} for {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}. If {{pi}} is composed with the natural isomorphism between {{math|PG(''n'', ''K'')}} and {{math|PG(''n'', ''K''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, the composition {{math|''θ''}} is an incidence preserving bijection between {{math|PG(''n'', ''K'')}} and {{math|PG(''n'', ''K''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. By the [[Fundamental theorem of projective geometry]] {{math|''θ''}} is induced by a [[semilinear map]] {{math|''T'': ''V'' → ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} with associated isomorphism {{math|''σ'': ''K'' → ''K''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which can be viewed as an [[antiautomorphism]] of {{math|''K''}}. In the classical literature, {{pi}} would be called a '''reciprocity''' in general, and if {{math|1=''σ'' = id}} it would be called a '''correlation''' (and {{math|''K''}} would necessarily be a [[field (mathematics)|field]]). Some authors suppress the role of the natural isomorphism and call {{math|''θ''}} a duality.&lt;ref&gt;for instance {{harvnb|Hirschfeld|1979|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this is done, a duality may be thought of as a [[collineation]] between a pair of specially related projective spaces and called a reciprocity. If this collineation is a [[projectivity]] then it is called a correlation.

Let {{math|1=''T''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''T''(''w'')}} denote the [[Linear functionals|linear functional]] of {{math|''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} associated with the vector {{math|''w''}} in {{math|''V''}}. Define the form {{math|''φ'': ''V'' × ''V'' → ''K''}} by:
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi (v,w) = T_w (v).&lt;/math&gt;
{{math|''φ''}} is a nondegenerate [[Sesquilinear form#Over arbitrary rings|sesquilinear form]] with companion antiautomorphism {{math|''σ''}}.

Any duality of {{math|PG(''n'', ''K'')}} for {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}} is induced by a nondegenerate sesquilinear form on the underlying vector space (with a companion antiautomorphism) and conversely.

==Homogeneous coordinate formulation==

[[Homogeneous coordinates]] may be used to give an algebraic description of dualities. To simplify this discussion we shall assume that {{math|''K''}} is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], but everything can be done in the same way when {{math|''K''}} is a skewfield as long as attention is paid to the fact that multiplication need not be a [[Commutative property|commutative]] operation.

The points of {{math|PG(''n'', ''K'')}} can be taken to be the nonzero vectors in the ({{math|''n'' + 1}})-dimensional [[vector space]] over {{math|''K''}}, where we identify two vectors which differ by a scalar factor. Another way to put it is that the points of {{math|''n''}}-dimensional projective space are the 1-dimensional vector [[Linear subspace|subspaces]], which may be visualized as the lines through the origin in {{math|''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;Dimension is being used here in two different senses. When referring to a projective space, the term is used in the common geometric way where lines are 1-dimensional and planes are 2-dimensional objects. However, when applied to a vector space, dimension means the number of vectors in a basis, and a basis for a vector subspace, thought of as a line, has two vectors in it, while a basis for a vector space, thought of as a plane, has three vectors in it. If the meaning is not clear from the context, the terms ''projective'' or ''geometric'' are applied to the projective space concept while ''algebraic'' or ''vector'' are applied to the vector space one. The relation between the two is simply: algebraic dimension = geometric dimension + 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Also the {{math|''n''}}- (vector) dimensional subspaces of {{math|''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}} represent the ({{math|''n'' − 1}})- (geometric) dimensional hyperplanes of projective {{math|''n''}}-space over {{math|''K''}}, i.e., {{math|PG(''n'', ''K'')}}.

A nonzero vector {{math|1='''u''' = (''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''u&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}  in {{math|''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}} also determines an {{math|(''n'' − 1)}} - geometric dimensional subspace (hyperplane) {{math|H&lt;sub&gt;'''u'''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, by 
:{{math|1=H&lt;sub&gt;'''u'''&lt;/sub&gt; = {(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') : ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''u&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0} }}.
When a vector {{math|'''u'''}} is used to define a hyperplane in this way it shall be denoted by {{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;}}, while if it is designating a point we will use {{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;}}. They are referred to as ''point coordinates'' or ''hyperplane coordinates'' respectively (in the important two-dimensional case, hyperplane coordinates are called ''line coordinates''). Some authors distinguish how a vector is to be interpreted by writing hyperplane coordinates as horizontal (row) vectors while point coordinates are written as vertical (column) vectors. Thus, if {{math|'''u'''}} is a column vector we would have {{math|1='''u'''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = '''u'''}} while {{math|1='''u'''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = '''u'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In terms of the usual [[dot product]], {{math|1=H&lt;sub&gt;'''u'''&lt;/sub&gt; = {'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; : '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = 0} }}. Since {{math|''K''}} is a field, the dot product is symmetrical, meaning {{math|1='''u'''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''u&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;u&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

===A fundamental example===
A simple reciprocity (actually a correlation) can be given by {{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; ↔ '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;}} between points and hyperplanes. This extends to a reciprocity between the line generated by two points and the intersection of two such hyperplanes, and so forth.

Specifically, in the [[projective plane]], {{math|PG(2, ''K'')}}, with {{math|''K''}} a field, we have the correlation given by: points in [[homogeneous coordinates]] {{math|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') ↔}} lines with equations {{math|1=''ax'' + ''by'' + ''cz'' = ''0''}}. In a projective space, {{math|PG(3, ''K'')}}, a correlation is given by: points in homogeneous coordinates {{math|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'') ↔}} planes with equations {{math|1=''ax'' + ''by'' + ''cz'' + ''dw'' = 0}}. This correlation would also map a line determined by two points {{math|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} to the line which is the intersection of the two planes with equations {{math|1=''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x'' + ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''y'' + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''z'' + ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''w'' = 0}} and {{math|1=''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''x'' + ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''y'' + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''z'' + ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''w'' = 0}}.

The associated sesquilinear form for this correlation is:
: {{math|1= ''φ''('''u''', '''x''') = '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''u&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}},
where the companion antiautomorphism {{math|1=''σ'' = id}}. This is therefore a [[bilinear form]] (note that {{math|''K''}} must be a field). This can be written in matrix form (with respect to the standard basis) as:
: {{math|1= ''φ''('''u''', '''x''') = '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; ''G'' '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;}},
where {{math|''G''}} is the {{math|(''n'' + 1) × (''n'' + 1)}} [[identity matrix]], using the convention that {{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a row vector and {{math|'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a column vector.

The correlation is given by:
: &lt;math&gt; \pi ( \mathbf{x}_P) =  (G \mathbf{x}_P)^{\mathsf{T}} = (\mathbf{x}_P)^{\mathsf{T}} = \mathbf{x}_H.&lt;/math&gt;

====Geometric interpretation in the real projective plane====

This correlation in the case of {{math|PG(2, '''R''')}} can be described geometrically using the [[mathematical model|model]] of the [[real projective plane]]  which is a "unit sphere with antipodes&lt;ref&gt;the points of a sphere at opposite ends of a diameter are called ''antipodal points''.&lt;/ref&gt; identified", or equivalently, the model of lines and planes through the origin of the vector space {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Associate to any line through the origin  the unique plane through the origin which is perpendicular (orthogonal) to the line. When, in the model, these lines are considered to be the points and the planes the lines of the projective plane {{math|PG(2, '''R''')}}, this association becomes a correlation (actually a polarity) of the projective plane. The sphere model is obtained by intersecting the lines and planes through the origin with a unit sphere centered at the origin. The lines meet the sphere in antipodal points which must then be identified to obtain a point of the projective plane, and the planes meet the sphere in [[great circle]]s which are thus the lines of the projective plane.

That this association "preserves" incidence is most easily seen from the lines and planes model. A point incident with a line in the projective plane corresponds to a line through the origin lying in a plane through the origin in the model. Applying the association, the plane becomes a line through the origin perpendicular to the plane it is associated with. This image line is perpendicular to every line of the plane which passes through the origin, in particular the original line (point of the projective plane). All lines that are perpendicular to the original line at the origin lie in the unique plane which is orthogonal to the original line, that is, the image plane under the association. Thus, the image line lies in the image plane and the association preserves incidence.

===Matrix form===

As in the above example, [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] can be used to represent dualities. Let {{pi}} be a duality of {{math|PG(''n'', ''K'')}} for {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}} and let {{math|''φ''}} be the associated sesquilinear form (with companion antiautomorphism {{math|''σ''}}) on the underlying ({{math|''n'' + 1}})-dimensional vector space {{math|''V''}}. Given a basis {{math|{ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; } }} of {{math|''V''}}, we may represent this form by:
:&lt;math&gt; \varphi(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{u}^{\mathsf{T}} G (\mathbf{x}^{\sigma}),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''G''}} is a nonsingular {{math|(''n'' + 1) × (''n'' + 1)}} matrix over {{math|''K''}} and the vectors are written as column vectors. The notation {{math|'''x'''&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} means that the antiautomorphism {{math|''σ''}} is applied to each coordinate of the vector {{math|'''x'''}}.

Now define the duality in terms of point coordinates by:
:&lt;math&gt; \pi ( \mathbf{x}) =  (G (\mathbf{x}^{\sigma}))^{\mathsf{T}}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--
==Three dimensions==

In a polarity of real projective 3-space, PG(3, '''R'''), points correspond to planes, and lines correspond to lines.  By restriction the [[dual polyhedron|duality of polyhedra]] in [[solid geometry]] is obtained, where points are dual to faces, and sides are dual to sides, so that the [[icosahedron]] is dual to the [[dodecahedron]], and the [[cube]] is dual to the [[octahedron]].
--&gt;

==Polarity==

A duality that is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] (has order two) is called a '''polarity'''. It is necessary to distinguish between polarities of general projective spaces and those that arise from the slightly more general definition of plane duality. It is also possible to give more precise statements in the case of a [[finite geometry]], so we shall emphasize the results in finite projective planes.

===Polarities of general projective spaces===
If {{pi}} is a duality of {{math|PG(''n'', ''K'')}}, with {{math|''K''}} a skewfield, then a common notation is defined by {{math|1={{pi}}(''S'') = ''S''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;}} for a subspace {{math|''S''}} of {{math|PG(''n'', ''K'')}}. Hence, a polarity is a duality for which {{math|1=''S''&lt;sup&gt;⊥⊥&lt;/sup&gt; = ''S''}} for every subspace {{math|''S''}} of {{math|PG(''n'', ''K'')}}. It is also common to bypass mentioning the dual space and write, in terms of the associated sesquilinear form:
: &lt;math&gt;S^{\bot} = \{\mathbf{u} \text{ in }V \colon \varphi (\mathbf{u},\mathbf{x}) =0 \text{ for all }\mathbf{x} \text{ in } S \}.&lt;/math&gt;

A sesquilinear form {{math|''φ''}} is ''reflexive'' if {{math|1=''φ''('''u''', '''x''') = 0}} implies {{math|1=''φ''('''x''', '''u''') = 0}}.

A duality is a polarity if and only if the (nondegenerate) sesquilinear form defining it is reflexive.&lt;ref name=Demb42&gt;{{harvnb|Dembowski|1968|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polarities have been classified, a result of {{harvtxt|Birkhoff|von Neumann|1936}} that has been reproven several times.&lt;ref name=Demb42 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baer|2005|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Artin|1957|pages=112–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let {{math|''V''}} be a (left) vector space over the skewfield {{math|''K''}} and {{math|''φ''}} be a reflexive nondegenerate sesquilinear form on {{math|''V''}} with companion anti-automorphism {{math|''σ''}}. If {{math|''φ''}} is the sesquilinear form associated with a polarity then either:
# {{math|1=''σ'' = id}} (hence, {{math|''K''}} is a field) and {{math|1=''φ''('''u''', '''x''') = ''φ''('''x''', '''u''')}} for all {{math|'''u''', '''x'''}} in {{math|''V''}}, that is, {{math|''φ''}} is a bilinear form. In this case, the polarity is called '''orthogonal''' (or '''ordinary'''). If the characteristic of the field {{math|''K''}} is two, then to be in this case there must exist a vector {{math|'''z'''}} with {{math|''φ''('''z''', '''z''') ≠ 0}}, and the polarity is called a '''pseudo polarity'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hirschfeld|1976|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{math|1=''σ'' = id}} (hence, {{math|''K''}} is a field) and {{math|1=''φ''('''u''', '''u''') = 0 }} for all {{math|'''u'''}} in {{math|''V''}}. The polarity is called a '''null polarity''' (or a '''symplectic polarity''') and can only exist when the projective dimension {{math|''n''}} is odd.
# {{math|1=''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = id ≠ ''σ''}} (here {{math|''K''}} need not be a field) and {{math|1=''φ''('''u''', '''x''') = ''φ''('''x''', '''u''')&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for all {{math|'''u''', '''x'''}} in {{math|''V''}}. Such a polarity is called a '''unitary polarity''' (or a '''Hermitian polarity''').

A point {{math|''P''}} of {{math|PG(''n'', ''K'')}} is an '''absolute point''' (self-conjugate point) with respect to polarity {{math|⊥}} if {{math|1=''P'' I ''P''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Similarly, a [[hyperplane]] {{math|''H''}} is an '''absolute hyperplane''' (self-conjugate hyperplane) if {{math|1=''H''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; I ''H''}}. Expressed in other terms, a point {{math|'''x'''}} is an absolute point of polarity {{pi}} with associated sesquilinear form {{math|''φ''}} if {{math|1= ''φ''('''x''', '''x''') = 0}} and if {{math|''φ''}} is written in terms of matrix {{math|''G''}}, {{math|1= '''x'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; ''G'' '''x'''&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt; = 0}}.

The set of absolute points of each type of polarity can be described. We again restrict the discussion to the case that {{math|''K''}} is a field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barwick|Ebert|2008|pages=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# If {{math|''K''}} is a field whose characteristic is not two, the set of absolute points of an orthogonal polarity form a nonsingular [[Quadric (projective geometry)|quadric]] (if {{math|''K''}} is infinite, this might be empty). If the characteristic is two, the absolute points of a pseudo polarity form a hyperplane.
# All the points of the space {{math|PG(2''s'' + 1, ''K'')}} are absolute points of a null polarity.
# The absolute points of a Hermitian polarity form a [[Hermitian variety]], which may be empty if {{math|''K''}} is infinite.

When composed with itself, the correlation {{math|1=''φ''('''x'''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;}} (in any dimension) produces the [[identity function]], so it is a polarity. The set of absolute points of this polarity would be the points whose homogeneous coordinates satisfy the equation:
:{{math|1='''x'''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0}}.
Which points are in this point set depends on the field {{math|''K''}}. If {{math|1=''K'' = '''R'''}} then the set is empty, there are no absolute points (and no absolute hyperplanes). On the other hand, if {{math|1=''K'' = '''C'''}} the set of absolute points form a nondegenerate [[quadric]] (a [[conic section|conic]] in two-dimensional space). If {{math|''K''}} is a [[finite field]] of odd [[characteristic (field)|characteristic]] the absolute points also form a quadric, but if the characteristic is even the absolute points form a hyperplane (this is an example of a pseudo polarity).

Under any duality, the point {{math|''P''}} is called the '''pole''' of the hyperplane {{math|''P''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and this hyperplane is called the '''polar''' of the point {{math|''P''}}. Using this terminology, the absolute points of a polarity are the points that are incident with their polars and the absolute hyperplanes are the hyperplanes that are incident with their poles.

===Polarities in finite projective planes===

By [[Wedderburn's little theorem|Wedderburn's theorem]] every finite skewfield is a field and an automorphism of order two (other than the identity) can only exist in a finite field whose order is a square. These facts help to simplify the general situation for finite [[Desarguesian plane]]s. We have:&lt;ref name="Dembowski 1968 page=153"&gt;{{harvnb|Dembowski|1968|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If {{pi}} is a polarity of the finite Desarguesian projective plane {{math|PG(2, ''q'')}} where {{math|1=''q'' = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''e''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for some prime {{math|''p''}}, then the number of absolute points of {{pi}} is {{math|''q'' + 1}} if {{pi}} is orthogonal or {{math|''q''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}} if {{pi}} is unitary. In the orthogonal case, the absolute points lie on a [[Conic section|conic]] if {{math|''p''}} is odd or form a line if {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}. The unitary case can only occur if {{math|''q''}} is a square; the absolute points and absolute lines form a [[Unital (geometry)|unital]].

In the general projective plane case where duality means ''plane duality'', the definitions of polarity, absolute elements, pole and polar remain the same.

Let {{math|'''P'''}} denote a projective plane of order {{math|''n''}}. Counting arguments can establish that for a polarity {{pi}} of {{math|'''P'''}}:&lt;ref name="Dembowski 1968 page=153"/&gt;

The number of non-absolute points (lines) incident with a non-absolute line (point) is even.

Furthermore,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=R.|last=Baer|title=Polarities in finite projective planes|journal= Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|year=1946|volume=52|pages=77–93|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1946-08506-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The polarity {{pi}} has at least {{math|''n'' + 1}} absolute points and if {{math|''n''}} is not a square, exactly {{math|''n'' + 1}} absolute points. If {{pi}} has exactly {{math|''n'' + 1}} absolute points then;
# if {{math|''n''}} is odd, the absolute points form an [[Oval (projective plane)|oval]] whose tangents are the absolute lines; or
# if {{math|''n''}} is even, the absolute points are [[collinear]] on a non-absolute line.

An upper bound on the number of absolute points in the case that {{math|''n''}} is a square was given by Seib&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=M.|last=Seib|title=Unitäre Polaritäten endlicher projectiver Ebenen|journal=Archiv der Mathematik|year=1970|volume=21|pages=103–112|doi=10.1007/bf01220887}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a purely combinatorial argument can establish:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Piper|1973|pages=245–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A polarity {{pi}} in a projective plane of square order {{math|1=''n'' = ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} has at most {{math|''s''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}} absolute points. Furthermore, if the number of absolute points is {{math|''s''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}}, then the absolute points and absolute lines form a [[Unital (geometry)|unital]] (i.e., every line of the plane meets this set of absolute points in either {{math|1}} or {{math|''s'' + 1}} points).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barwick|Ebert|2008|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poles and polars==
{{Main|Pole and polar}}
[[File:Reciprocation.svg|thumb|right|Pole and polar with respect to circle ''C''. ''P'' and ''Q'' are inverse points, ''p'' is the polar of ''P'', ''P'' is the pole of ''p''.]]

===Reciprocation in the Euclidean plane===

A method that can be used to construct a polarity of the real projective plane has, as its starting point, a construction of a partial duality in the [[Euclidean plane]].

In the Euclidean plane, fix a circle {{math|''C''}} with center {{math|''O''}} and radius {{math|''r''}}. For each point {{math|''P''}} other than {{math|''O''}} define an image point {{math|''Q''}} so that {{math|1=''OP'' ⋅ ''OQ'' = ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The mapping defined by {{math|''P'' → ''Q''}} is called '''[[Inversive geometry|inversion]]''' with respect to circle {{math|''C''}}. The line {{math|''p''}} through {{math|''Q''}} which is perpendicular to the line {{math|''OP''}} is called the '''polar'''&lt;ref name=comment1&gt;Although no duality has yet been defined these terms are being used in anticipation of the existence of one.&lt;/ref&gt; of the point {{math|''P''}} with respect to circle {{math|''C''}}.

Let {{math|''q''}} be a line not passing through {{math|''O''}}. Drop a perpendicular from {{math|''O''}} to {{math|''q''}}, meeting {{math|''q''}} at the point {{math|''P''}} (this is the point of {{math|''q''}} that is closest to {{math|''O''}}). The image {{math|''Q''}} of {{math|''P''}} under inversion with respect to {{math|''C''}} is called the '''pole'''&lt;ref name=comment1 /&gt; of {{math|''q''}}. If a point {{math|''M''}} is on a line {{math|''q''}} (not passing through {{math|''O''}}) then the pole of {{math|''q''}} lies on the polar of {{math|''M''}} and vice versa. The incidence preserving process, in which points and lines are transformed into their polars and poles with respect to {{math|''C''}} is called '''reciprocation'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter and Greitzer|1967|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to turn this process into a correlation, the Euclidean plane (which is not a projective plane) needs to be expanded to the [[Projective plane|extended euclidean plane]] by adding a [[line at infinity]] and [[points at infinity]] which lie on this line. In this expanded plane, we define the polar of the point {{math|''O''}} to be the line at infinity (and {{math|''O''}} is the pole of the line at infinity), and the poles of the lines through {{math|''O''}} are the points of infinity where, if a line has [[slope]] {{math|''s'' (≠ 0)}} its pole is the infinite point associated to the parallel class of lines with slope {{math|−1/''s''}}. The pole of the {{math|''x''}}-axis is the point of infinity of the vertical lines and the pole of the {{math|''y''}}-axis is the point of infinity of the horizontal lines.

The construction of a correlation based on inversion in a circle given above can be generalized by using inversion in a conic section (in the extended real plane). The correlations constructed in this manner are of order two, that is, polarities.

====Algebraic formulation====

[[File:ProjectiveDuality.PNG|thumb|left|Three pairs of dual points and lines: one red pair, one yellow pair, and one blue pair.]]

We shall describe this polarity algebraically by following the above construction in the case that {{math|''C''}} is the unit circle (i.e., {{math|1=''r'' = 1}}) centered at the origin.

An affine point {{math|''P''}}, other than the origin, with Cartesian coordinates {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} has as its inverse in the unit circle the point {{math|''Q''}} with coordinates,
:&lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{a}{a^2 + b^2}, \frac{b}{a^2 + b^2} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
The line passing through {{math|''Q''}} that is perpendicular to the line {{overbar|{{math|''OP''}}}} has equation {{math|1= ''ax'' + ''by'' = 1}}.

Switching to homogeneous coordinates using the embedding {{math|(''a'', ''b'') ↦ (''a'', ''b'', 1)}}, the extension to the real projective plane is obtained by permitting the last coordinate to be 0. Recalling that point coordinates are written as column vectors and line coordinates as row vectors, we may express this polarity by:

:&lt;math&gt; \pi : \mathbb{R}P^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}P^2 &lt;/math&gt;
such that
:&lt;math&gt; \pi \left ( (x,y,z)^{\mathsf{T}} \right ) = (x, y, -z).&lt;/math&gt;

Or, using the alternate notation, {{math|1={{pi}}((''x'', ''y'', ''z'')&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''x'', ''y'', −''z'')&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The matrix of the associated sesquilinear form (with respect to the standard basis) is:

:&lt;math&gt; G = \left (\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{matrix} \right ). &lt;/math&gt;

The absolute points of this polarity are given by the solutions of:

:&lt;math&gt; 0 = P^{\mathsf{T}} G P = x^2 + y^2 - z^2, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''''P'''''}}&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;{{math|1= = (''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}. Note that restricted to the Euclidean plane (that is, set {{math|1=''z'' = 1}}) this is just the unit circle, the circle of inversion.

===Synthetic approach===
[[File:conicpolediag.svg|thumb|Diagonal triangle {{math|''P'', ''Q'', ''R''}} of quadrangle {{math|''A'', ''B'', ''J'', ''K''}} on conic. Polars of diagonal points are colored the same as the points.]]
The theory of poles and polars of a conic in a projective plane can be developed without the use of coordinates and other metric concepts.

Let {{math|''C''}} be a conic in {{math|PG(2, ''F'')}} where {{math|''F''}} is a field not of characteristic two, and let {{math|''P''}} be a point of this plane not on {{math|''C''}}. Two distinct secant lines to the conic, say {{overline|{{math|''AB''}}}} and {{overline|{{math|''JK''}}}} determine four points on the conic ({{math|''A'', ''B'', ''J'', ''K''}}) that form a [[Complete quadrangle|quadrangle]]. The point {{math|''P''}} is a vertex of the diagonal triangle of this quadrangle. The ''polar'' of {{math|''P''}} with respect to {{math|''C''}} is the side of the diagonal triangle opposite {{math|''P''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1964|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of [[harmonic conjugate]]s of points on a line can also be used to define this relationship. Using the same notation as above;

If a variable line through the point {{math|''P''}} is a secant of the conic {{math|''C''}}, the harmonic conjugates of {{math|''P''}} with respect to the two points of {{math|''C''}} on the secant all lie on the ''polar'' of {{math|''P''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Properties===

There are several properties that polarities in a projective plane have.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1964|pages=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given a polarity {{pi}}, a point {{math|''P''}} lies on line {{math|''q''}}, the polar of point {{math|''Q''}} if and only if {{math|''Q''}} lies on {{math|''p''}}, the polar of {{math|''P''}}.

Points {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''Q''}} that are in this relation are called '''conjugate''' points with respect to {{pi}}. Absolute points are called '''self-conjugate''' in keeping with this definition since they are incident with their own polars. Conjugate lines are defined dually.

The line joining two self-conjugate points cannot be a self-conjugate line.

A line cannot contain more than two self-conjugate points.

A polarity induces an involution of conjugate points on any line that is not self-conjugate.

A triangle in which each vertex is the pole of the opposite side is called a '''self-polar''' triangle.

A correlation that maps the three vertices of a triangle to their opposite sides respectively is a polarity and this triangle is self-polar with respect to this polarity.

==Mapping the sphere onto the plane==
The unit sphere modulo &amp;minus;1 model of the projective plane is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (w.r.t. incidence properties) to the planar model: the affine plane extended with a projective line at infinity.

To map a point on the sphere to a point on the plane, let the plane be tangent to the sphere at some point which shall be the origin of the plane's coordinate system (2-D origin).  Then construct a line passing through the center of the sphere (3-D origin) and the point on the sphere.  This line intersects the plane at a point which is the projection of the point on the sphere onto the plane (or vice versa).

This projection can be used to define a one-to-one onto mapping
:&lt;math&gt; f:[0,\pi/2] \times [0,2 \pi] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}P^2. &lt;/math&gt;
If points in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}P^2 &lt;/math&gt; are expressed in [[homogeneous coordinates]], then
:&lt;math&gt; f:(\theta, \phi) \mapsto [\cos \phi : \sin \phi : \cot \theta], &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; f^{-1} : [x : y : z] \mapsto \left( \arctan \sqrt{\left({x \over z}\right)^2 + \left({y\over z}\right)^2}, \arctan_2 (y,x) \right). &lt;/math&gt;

Also, lines in the planar model are projections of great circles of the sphere.  This is so because through any line in the plane pass an infinitude of different planes: one of these planes passes through the 3-D origin, but a plane passing through the 3-D origin intersects the sphere along a great circle.

As we have seen, any great circle in the unit sphere has a projective point perpendicular to it, which can be defined as its dual.  But this point is a pair of antipodal points on the unit sphere, through both of which passes a unique 3-D line, and this line extended past the unit sphere intersects the tangent plane at a point, which means that there is a geometric way to associate a unique point on the plane to every line on the plane, such that the point is the dual of the line.

The principle of duality is due to [[Joseph Diaz Gergonne]] (1771−1859) a champion of the then emerging field of [[Analytic geometry]] and founder and editor of the first journal devoted entirely to mathematics, ''[[Annales de mathématiques pures et appliquées]]''. Gergonne and [[Charles Julien Brianchon]] (1785−1864) developed the concept of plane duality. Gergonne coined the terms "duality" and "polar" (but "pole" is due to [[Francois-Joseph Servois|F.-J. Servois]]) and adopted the style of writing dual statements side-by-side in his journal.

[[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] (1788−1867) author of the first text on [[projective geometry]], ''Traité des propriétés projectives des figures'', was a [[synthetic geometry|synthetic geometer]] who systematically developed the theory of poles and polars with respect to a conic. Poncelet maintained that the principle of duality was a consequence of the theory of poles and polars.

[[Julius Plücker]] (1801−1868) is credited with extending the concept of duality to three and higher dimensional projective spaces.

Poncelet and Gergonne started out as earnest but friendly rivals presenting their different points of view and techniques in papers appearing in ''[[Annales de Gergonne]]''. Antagonism grew over the issue of priority in claiming the principle of duality as their own. A young Plücker was caught up in this feud when a paper he had submitted to Gergonne was so heavily edited by the time it was published that Poncelet was misled into believing that Plücker had plagiarized him. The vitriolic attack by Poncelet was countered by Plücker with the support of Gergonne and ultimately the onus was placed on Gergonne.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|2004|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this feud, Pierre Samuel&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Samuel|1988|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; has quipped that since both men were in the French army and Poncelet was a general while Gergonne a mere captain, Poncelet's view prevailed, at least among their French contemporaries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1932">In [[operator algebras]], the '''enveloping von Neumann algebra''' of a [[C*-algebra]] is a [[von Neumann algebra]] that contains all the operator-algebraic information about the given C*-algebra. This may also be called the '''''universal'' enveloping von Neumann algebra''', since it is given by a [[universal property]]; and (as always with von Neumann algebras) the term ''W*-algebra'' may be used in place of ''von Neumann algebra''.

== Definition ==

Let ''A'' be a [[C*-algebra]] and ''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; be its [[GNS construction|universal representation]], acting on Hilbert space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt;. The image of ''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''), is a C*-subalgebra of bounded operators on ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt;. The '''enveloping von Neumann algebra''' of ''A'' is the closure of ''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') in the weak operator topology. It is sometimes denoted by ''A''&amp;prime;&amp;prime;.

== Properties ==

The universal representation ''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&amp;prime;&amp;prime; satisfies the following [[universal property]]: for any representation ''&amp;pi;'', there is a unique *-homomorphism

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi: \pi_U(A)'' \rightarrow \pi(A)'' &lt;/math&gt;
 
that is continuous in the weak operator topology and the restriction of &amp;Phi; to ''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') is ''&amp;pi;''.

As a particular case, one can consider the [[continuous functional calculus]], whose unique extension gives a canonical [[Borel functional calculus]].
 
By the [[Sherman–Takeda theorem]], the double dual of a C*-algebra ''A'', ''A''**, can be identified with ''A''&amp;prime;&amp;prime;, as [[Banach space]]s.

Every representation of ''A'' uniquely determines a central projection (i.e. a projection in the center of the algebra) in ''A''&amp;prime;&amp;prime;; it is called the '''central cover''' of that projection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2840">[[File:Equichordal-center.svg|thumb|Curve (red) with two chords (black), intersecting in the equichordal point.]]
In [[geometry]], an '''equichordal point''' is a point defined relative to a [[Convex set|convex]] plane curve such that all [[Chord (geometry)|chords]] passing through the point are equal in length. Two common figures with equichordal points are the [[circle]] and the [[limaçon]].  It is impossible for a curve to have more than one equichordal point.

A curve is called equichordal when it has an equichordal point.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In 1916 Fujiwara proposed the question of whether a curve could have two equichordal points (offering in the same paper a proof that three or more is impossible). Independently, a year later, Blaschke, Rothe and Weitzenböck posed the same question.&lt;ref&gt;W. Blaschke, W. Rothe, and R. Weitztenböck. Aufgabe 552. Arch. Math. Phys., 27:82, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem remained unsolved until it was finally proven impossible in 1996 by [[Marek Rychlik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In [[physics]], '''fractional quantum mechanics''' is a generalization of standard [[quantum mechanics]], which naturally comes out when the Brownian-like quantum paths substitute with the Lévy-like ones in the [[Feynman path integral]]. It has been discovered by [[Nick Laskin]] who coined the term ''fractional quantum mechanics''.&lt;ref&gt;N. Laskin, (2000), [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0375-9601(00)00201-2 Fractional Quantum Mechanics and Lévy Path Integrals. ''Physics Letters'' 268A, 298-304].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals==
Standard quantum mechanics can be approached in three different ways: the [[matrix mechanics]], the [[Schrödinger equation]] and the [[Feynman path integral]].

The [[Feynman path integral]]&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Feynman and A. R. Hibbs, Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals ~McGraw-Hill, New York, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; is the path integral over Brownian-like quantum-mechanical paths. Fractional quantum mechanics has been discovered by [[Nick Laskin]] (1999) as a result of expanding the [[Feynman path integral]], from the Brownian-like to the Lévy-like quantum mechanical paths. A path integral over the Lévy-like quantum-mechanical paths results in a generalization of [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Laskin, (2000), [http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v62/i3/p3135_1 Fractional Quantum Mechanics, ''Physical Review'' E62, 3135-3145]. '' (also available online: https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1769)&lt;/ref&gt; If the [[Feynman path integral]] leads to the well known [[Schrödinger equation]], then the path integral over [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Lévy]] trajectories leads to the [[fractional Schrödinger equation]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Laskin, (2002), [http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v66/i5/e056108 Fractional Schrödinger equation, ''Physical Review'' E66, 056108 7 pages]. '' (also available online: https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206098)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lévy process]] is characterized
by the Lévy index ''α'', 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''α''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;2. At the special case when ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 the [[Lévy process]] becomes the process of [[Brownian motion]]. The fractional Schrödinger equation includes a space [[derivative]] of fractional order ''α'' instead of the second order (''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2) space derivative in the standard Schrödinger equation. Thus, the fractional Schrödinger equation is a [[fractional differential equation]] in accordance with modern terminology.&lt;ref&gt;S. G. Samko, A. A. Kilbas, and O. I. Marichev, Fractional
Integrals and Derivatives, Theory and Applications ~Gordon
and Breach, Amsterdam, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; This is the key point to launch the term [[fractional Schrödinger equation]] and more general term ''fractional quantum mechanics''. As mentioned above, at ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 the Lévy motion becomes [[Brownian motion]]. Thus, fractional quantum mechanics includes standard quantum mechanics as a particular case at ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. The quantum-mechanical path integral over the Lévy paths at ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 becomes the well-known [[Feynman path integral]] and the [[fractional Schrödinger equation]] becomes the well-known [[Schrödinger equation]].

=== Fractional Schrödinger equation ===

The [[fractional Schrödinger equation]] discovered by [[Nick Laskin]] has the following form (see, Refs.[1,3,4])

: &lt;math&gt;i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi (\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t}=D_\alpha (-\hbar
^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2}\psi (\mathbf{r},t)+V(\mathbf{r},t)\psi (\mathbf{r},t)\, &lt;/math&gt;

using the standard definitions:
*'''r''' is the 3-dimensional [[position vector]], 
*''ħ'' is the reduced [[Planck constant]], 
*''ψ''('''r''', ''t'') is the [[wavefunction]], which is the quantum mechanical function that determines the probability amplitude for the particle to have a given position '''r''' at any given time ''t'', 
*''V''('''r''', ''t'') is a [[potential energy]], 
*Δ = &amp;part;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&amp;part;'''r'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[Laplace operator]].

Further,
*''D&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a scale constant with [[dimensional analysis|physical dimension]] [D&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;] = [energy]&lt;sup&gt;1 − ''α''&lt;/sup&gt;·[length]&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;[time]&lt;sup&gt;−''α''&lt;/sup&gt;, at ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; =1/2''m'', where ''m'' is a particle mass,
*the operator (−''ħ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Δ)&lt;sup&gt;''α''/2&lt;/sup&gt; is the 3-dimensional fractional quantum Riesz derivative defined by (see, Refs.[3, 4]);

::&lt;math&gt;
(-\hbar ^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2}\psi (\mathbf{r},t)=\frac 1{(2\pi \hbar
)^3}\int d^3pe^{i \mathbf{p}\cdot \mathbf{r}/\hbar}|\mathbf{p}|^\alpha \varphi (
\mathbf{p},t),
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the wave functions in the [[position and momentum space]]s; &lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \varphi (\mathbf{p},t)&lt;/math&gt; are related each other by the 3-dimensional [[Fourier transform]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi (\mathbf{r},t)=\frac 1{(2\pi \hbar )^3}\int d^3pe^{i \mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}/\hbar}\varphi (\mathbf{p},t),\qquad \varphi (\mathbf{p},t)=\int d^3re^{-i
\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}/\hbar }\psi (\mathbf{r},t).
&lt;/math&gt;

The index ''α'' in the fractional Schrödinger equation is the Lévy index, 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''α''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;2.

=== Fractional quantum mechanics in solid state systems ===
The effective mass of states in solid state systems can depend on the wave vector k, i.e. formally one considers m=m(k). Polariton Bose-Einstein condensate modes are examples of states in solid state systems with mass sensitive to variations and locally in k fractional quantum mechanics is experimentally feasible.

The [[rough set]]s can be used to induce three-way classification decisions. The positive negative and boundary regions can be interpreted as regions of acceptance, rejection and deferment decisions, respectively. The probabilistic rough set model extends the conventional rough sets by providing more effective way for classifying objects. A main result of probabilistic rough sets is the interpretation of three-way decisions using a pair of probabilistic thresholds. The game-theoretic rough set model determine and interprets the required thresholds by utilizing a game-theoretic environment for analyzing strategic situations between cooperative or conflicting decision making criteria. The essential idea is to implement a [[Game theory|game]] for investigating how the probabilistic thresholds may change in order to improve the rough set based [[decision making]].&lt;ref&gt;N.

'''Hassler Whitney''' (March 23, 1907 – May 10, 1989) was an American [[mathematician]]. He was one of the founders of [[singularity theory]], and did foundational work in [[manifold]]s, [[embedding]]s, [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]]s, [[characteristic class]]es, and [[geometric integration theory]].

==Biography==

===Life===
Hassler Whitney was born on March 23, 1907, in New York City, where his father [[Edward Baldwin Whitney]] was the First District [[New York Supreme Court]] judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Thom|1990|p=474}} and {{harvtxt|Chern|1994|p=465}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Josepha (Newcomb) Whitney, was an artist and active in politics.&lt;ref name="Chernp465"&gt;{{harvtxt|Chern|1994|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandfather was [[William Dwight Whitney]], professor of Ancient Languages at [[Yale University]], linguist, and [[Sanskrit]] scholar.&lt;ref name="Chernp465" /&gt; Whitney was the great grandson of Connecticut Governor and US Senator [[Roger Sherman Baldwin]], and the great-great-grandson of American founding father [[Roger Sherman]]. His maternal grandparents were astronomer and mathematician [[Simon Newcomb]] (1835-1909), a [[Steeves]] descendant, and Mary Hassler Newcomb, granddaughter of the first superintendent of the Coast Survey [[Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler]]. His great uncle [[Josiah Whitney]] was the first to survey [[Mount Whitney]].&lt;ref&gt;According to {{harvtxt|Chern|1994|p=465}} and {{harvtxt|Thom|1990|p=474}}: Thom cites Josiah Whitney explicitly while Chern simply states that:-"''... a great uncle was the first to survey Mount Whitney''".&lt;/ref&gt;

He married three times: his first wife was Margaret R. Howell, married on the 30 May 1930. They had three children, James Newcomb, Carol and Marian. After his first divorce, on January 16, 1955 he married Mary Barnett Garfield. He and Mary had two daughters, Sarah Newcomb and Emily Baldwin. Finally, Whitney divorced his second wife and married Barbara Floyd Osterman on 8 February 1986.

Whitney and his first wife Margaret made an innovative decision in 1939 that influenced the history of modern architecture in New England, when they commissioned the architect Edwin B. Goodell, Jr. to design a new residence for their family in Weston, Massachusetts. They purchased a rocky hillside site on a historic road, next door to another International Style house by Goodell from several years earlier, designed for Richard and Caroline Field.

Distinctively featuring flat roofs, flush wood siding, and corner windows—all of which were unusual architectural elements at the time—the Whitney House was also a creative response to its site, in that it placed the main living spaces one floor above ground level, with large banks of windows opening to the south sun and to views of the beautiful property. The Whitney House survives today, along with the Field House, more than 75 years following its original construction; both are contributing structures in the historic Sudbury Road Area.

Throughout his life he pursued two particular hobbies with excitement: music and mountain-climbing. An accomplished player of the violin and the viola, Whitney played with the Princeton Musical Amateurs. He would run outside, 6 to 12 miles every other day. As an undergraduate, with his cousin Bradley Gilman, Whitney made the first ascent of the Whitney–Gilman ridge on [[Cannon Mountain (New Hampshire)|Cannon Mountain]], New Hampshire in 1929. It was the hardest and most famous rock climb in the East. He was a member of the Swiss Alpine Society and the Yale Mountaineering Society (the precursor to the Yale Outdoors Club) and climbed most of the mountain peaks in Switzerland.{{sfnp|Fowler|1989}}

====Death====
Three years after his third marriage, on 10 May 1989, Whitney died in Princeton,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kendig|2013|p=18}} clarifies Princeton, NJ as his correct death place.&lt;/ref&gt; after suffering a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;According to {{harvtxt|Kendig|2013|p=18}}. Kendig writes also that being him apparently in good health, the physicians attributed the cause of the stroke to the treatments for prostate cancer he was undergoing.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with his wish, Hassler Whitney ashes rest atop [[mountain]] [[Dents Blanches]] in Switzerland where Oscar Burlet, another mathematician and member of the [[Swiss Alpine Club]], placed them on August 20, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;The story on his resting place story is reported by {{harvtxt|Chern|1994|p=467}}: see also {{harvtxt|Kendig|2013|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic career===
Whitney attended [[Yale University]] where he received baccalaureate degrees in physics and in music, respectively in 1928 and in 1929.&lt;ref name="Chernp465" /&gt; Later, in 1932, he earned a [[PhD]] in mathematics at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="Chernp465" /&gt; His doctoral dissertation was ''The Coloring of Graphs'', written under the supervision of [[George David Birkhoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=JJ and E F Robertson|title=Hassler Whitney|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Whitney.html|accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Kendig|2013|pp=8–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
At Harvard, Birkhoff also got him a job as Instructor of Mathematics for the years 1930–31,&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Kendig|2013|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and an Assistant Professorship for the years 1934–35.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Kendig|2013|pp=9–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on he held the following working positions: NRC Fellow, Mathematics, 1931–33; Assistant Professor, 1935–40; Associate Professor, 1940–46, Professor, 1946–52; Professor Instructor, [[Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Princeton University]], 1952–77; Professor Emeritus, 1977–89; Chairman of the Mathematics Panel, [[National Science Foundation]], 1953–56; Exchange Professor, [[Collège de France]], 1957; Memorial Committee, Support of Research in Mathematical Sciences, National Research Council, 1966–67; President, International Commission of Mathematical Instruction, 1979–82; Research Mathematician, [[National Defense Research Committee]], 1943–45; Construction of the School of Mathematics.

He was a member of the [[National Academy of Science]]; Colloquium Lecturer, [[American Mathematical Society]], 1946; Vice President, 1948–50 and Editor, American Journal of Mathematics, 1944–49; Editor, [[Mathematical Reviews]], 1949–54; Chairman of the Committee vis. lectureship, 1946–51; Committee Summer Instructor, 1953–54;, [[American Mathematical Society]]; American National Council Teachers of Mathematics, [[London Mathematical Society]] (Honorary), Swiss Mathematics Society (Honorary), [[Académie des Sciences|Académie des Sciences de Paris]] (Foreign Associate); [[New York Academy of Sciences]].

===Honors===
In 1947 he was elected member of the [[American Philosophical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Chern|1994|p=465}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1969 he was awarded the [[Lester R. Ford Award]] for the paper in two parts "''The mathematics of Physical quantities''" ([[#{{harvid|Whitney|1968a}}|1968a]], [[#{{harvid|Whitney|1968b}}|1968b]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Whitney|1992a|p=xi}} and {{harvtxt|Whitney|1992b|p=xi}}, section, "''Academic Appointments and Awards''".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 he was awarded the National Medal of Science. In 1980 he was elected honorary member of the [[London Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;See the official list of honorary members redacted by {{harvtxt|Fisher|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 he received the Wolf Prize from the [[Wolf Foundation]], and finally, in 1985, he was awarded the [[Steele Prize]] from the American Mathematical Society.

==Work==

===Research===
Whitney's earliest work, from 1930 to 1933, was on [[graph theory]].  Many of his contributions were to the graph-coloring, and the ultimate computer-assisted solution to the [[four-color problem]] relied on some of his results. His work in graph theory culminated in a 1933 paper,{{sfnp|Whitney|1933}} where he laid the foundations for [[matroids]], a fundamental notion in modern [[combinatorics]] and [[representation theory]] independently introduced by him and [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden]] in the mid 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;According to {{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Will|title=Matroids|url=http://www.math.washington.edu/~morrow/336_09/papers/Will.pdf|accessdate=5 February 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this paper Whitney proved several theorems about [[Matroid#Matroids from graph theory|the matroid of a graph]] {{math|M(G)}}: one such theorem, now called Whitney's 2-Isomorphism Theorem, states: Given {{math|G}} and {{math|H}} are graphs with no isolated vertices. Then {{math|M(G)}} and {{math|M(H)}} are [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] if and only if {{math|G}} and {{math|H}} are 2-isomorphic.&lt;ref&gt;According to {{harvtxt|Oxley|1992|pp=147–153}}. Recall that two graphs {{math|G}} and {{math|G'}} are 2-isomorphic if one can be transformed into the other by applying operations of the following types:
*[[Edge contraction#Vertex identification|Vertex identification]] 
*[[Edge contraction#Vertex Cleaving|Vertex cleaving]] 
*Twisting.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitney's lifelong interest in geometric properties of functions also began around this time.  His earliest work in this subject was on the possibility of extending a function defined on a closed subset of ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to a function on all of ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with certain smoothness properties. A complete solution to this problem was found only in 2005 by [[Charles Fefferman]].

In a 1936 paper, Whitney gave a definition of a [[smooth manifold]] of class ''{{math|C}}'' &lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;, and proved that, for high enough values of ''r'', a smooth manifold of dimension ''n'' may be [[embedding|embedded]] in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersed]] in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  (In 1944 he managed to reduce the dimension of the ambient space by 1, provided that ''n'' &gt; 2, by a technique that has come to be known as the "[[Whitney trick]]".) This basic result shows that manifolds may be treated intrinsically or extrinsically, as we wish. The intrinsic definition had been published only a few years earlier in the work of [[Oswald Veblen]] and [[J. H. C. Whitehead]]. These theorems opened the way for much more refined studies: of embedding, immersion and also of smoothing: that is, the possibility of having various [[smooth structure]]s on a given [[topological manifold]].

He was one of the major developers of [[cohomology theory]], and [[characteristic class]]es, as these concepts emerged in the late 1930s, and his work on algebraic topology continued into the 40s. He also returned to the study of functions in the 1940s, continuing his work on the extension problems formulated a decade earlier, and answering a question of [[Laurent Schwartz]] in a 1948 paper ''On Ideals of Differentiable Functions''.

Whitney had, throughout the 1950s, an almost unique interest in the topology of singular spaces and in singularities of smooth maps. An old idea, implicit even in the notion of a simplicial complex, was to study a singular space by decomposing it into smooth pieces (nowadays called "strata"). Whitney was the first to see  any subtlety in this definition, and pointed out that a good "stratification" should satisfy conditions he termed "A" and "B", now referred to as [[Whitney conditions]]. The work of [[René Thom]] and [[John Mather (mathematician)|John Mather]] in the 1960s showed that these conditions give a very robust definition of stratified space.
The singularities in low dimension of smooth mappings, later to come to prominence in the work of René Thom, were also first studied by Whitney.

In his book ''Geometric Integration Theory'' he gives a theoretical basis for [[Stokes' theorem]] applied with singularities on the boundary:&lt;ref&gt;See [[#{{harvid|Federer|1958}}|Federer's review (1958]]).&lt;/ref&gt; later, his work on such topics inspired the researches of [[Jenny Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

These aspects of Whitney's work have looked more unified, in retrospect and with the general development of singularity theory. Whitney's purely topological work ([[Stiefel–Whitney class]], basic results on [[vector bundle]]s) entered the mainstream more quickly.

===Teaching activity===

====Teaching the youth====
In 1967, he became involved full-time in educational problems, especially at the elementary school level.
He spent many years in classrooms, both teaching mathematics and observing how it is taught.&lt;ref&gt;Hechinger, Fred. "Learning Math by Thinking".June 10, 1986. http://rationalmathed.blogspot.com/2009/04/learning-math-by-thinking-hassler.html#!/2009/04/learning-math-by-thinking-hassler.html.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent four months teaching pre-algebra mathematics to a classroom of seventh graders and conducted summer courses for teachers. He traveled widely to lecture on the subject in the United States and abroad. He worked toward removing the ''mathematics anxiety,'' which he felt leads young pupils to avoid mathematics. Whitney spread the ideas of teaching mathematics to students in ways that relate the content to their own lives as opposed to teaching them rote memorization.

==Selected publications==

Hassler Whitney published 82 works:&lt;ref&gt;Complete bibliography in {{harvtxt|Whitney|1992a|pp=xii–xiv}} and {{harvtxt|Whitney|1992b|pp=xii–xiv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; all his published articles, included the ones listed in this section and the preface of the book {{harvtxt|Whitney|1957}}, are collected in the two volumes {{harvtxt|Whitney|1992a|pp=xii–xiv}} and {{harvtxt|Whitney|1992b|pp=xii–xiv}}.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Hill equation''' or '''Hill differential equation''' is the second-order linear [[ordinary differential equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + f(t) y = 0, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''f(t)'' is a [[periodic function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magnus|first=W.|last2=Winkler|first2=S.|title=Hill's equation|year=2013|publisher=Courier|isbn=9780486150291}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[George William Hill]], who introduced it in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02417081|authorlink=George William Hill|first=G.W.|last=Hill|title=On the Part of the Motion of Lunar Perigee Which is a Function of the Mean Motions of the Sun and Moon|journal=Acta Math.|volume=8|issue=1|pages=1–36|year=1886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can always rescale ''t'' so that the period of ''f''(''t'') equals ''π''; then the Hill equation can be rewritten using the [[Fourier series]] of ''f''(''t''):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}+\left(\theta_0+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty \theta_n \cos(2nt)+\sum_{m=1}^\infty \phi_m \sin(2mt) \right ) y=0. &lt;/math&gt;

Important special cases of Hill's equation include the [[Mathieu_function#Mathieu_equation|Mathieu equation]] (in which only the terms corresponding to ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1 are included) and the [[Meissner equation]].

Hill's equation is an important example in the understanding of periodic differential equations. Depending on the exact shape of ''f''(''t''), solutions may stay bounded for all time, or the amplitude of the oscillations in solutions may grow exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Aside from its original application to lunar stability, the Hill equation appears in many settings including the modeling of a [[quadrupole mass spectrometer]], as the one-dimensional [[Schrödinger equation]] of an electron in a crystal, [[quantum optics]] of two-level systems, and in [[Accelerator_physics#Beam_dynamics|accelerator physics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4005">In [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], the '''Hrushovski construction''' generalizes the [[Age (model theory)|Fraïssé limit]] by working with a notion of ''strong substructure'' &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt;.  It can be thought of as a kind of "model-theoretic forcing", where a (usually) stable structure is created, called the ''generic'' or ''rich'' &lt;ref name=Wagner&gt;[http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~wagner/nijmegen.pdf Slides on Hrushovski construction from Frank Wagner]&lt;/ref&gt; model.  The specifics of &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; determine various properties of the generic, with its geometric properties being of particular interest.  It was initially used by [[Ehud Hrushovski]] to generate a stable structure with an "exotic" geometry, thereby refuting Zil'ber's Conjecture.

== Three conjectures ==
The initial applications of the Hrushovski construction refuted two conjectures and answered a third question in the negative.  Specifically, we have:

* '''Lachlan's Conjecture''' Any stable &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;-categorical theory is totally transcendental.&lt;ref name=pseudoplane&gt;E. Hrushovski.  A stable &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;-categorical pseudoplane.  ''Preprint, 1988''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Zil'ber's Conjecture''' Any uncountably categorical theory is either locally modular or interprets an algebraically closed field.&lt;ref name=sminimal&gt;E. Hrushovski. A new strongly minimal set. ''Annals of Pure and Applied Logic'', 52:147&amp;ndash;166, ''1993''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cherlin's Question''' Is there a maximal (with respect to expansions) strongly minimal set?

== The construction ==

Let ''L'' be a finite relational language.  Fix '''C''' a class of ''finite'' ''L''-structures which are closed under isomorphisms and
substructures.  We want to strengthen the notion of substructure; let
&lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; be a relation on pairs from '''C''' satisfying:

* &lt;math&gt;A \leq B&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \leq C&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;A \leq B&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\varnothing \leq A&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;A \in \C&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;A \leq B&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;A \cap C \leq B \cap C&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;C \in \C&lt;/math&gt;. 
* If &lt;math&gt;f:  A \rightarrow A'&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism and &lt;math&gt;A \leq B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; extends to an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;B \rightarrow B'&lt;/math&gt; for some superset of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A' \leq B'&lt;/math&gt;.

An embedding &lt;math&gt;f: A \hookrightarrow D&lt;/math&gt; is ''strong'' if &lt;math&gt;f(A) \leq D&lt;/math&gt;.

We also want the pair ('''C''', &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;) to satisfy the  ''amalgamation property'':  if &lt;math&gt;A \leq B_1, A \leq B_2&lt;/math&gt; then there is a &lt;math&gt;D \in \C&lt;/math&gt;
so that each &lt;math&gt;B_i&lt;/math&gt; embeds strongly into &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; with the same image for
&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

For infinite &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A \in \C&lt;/math&gt;, we say &lt;math&gt;A \leq D&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;A \leq X&lt;/math&gt; for
&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq X \subseteq D&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;X \in \C&lt;/math&gt;.  For any &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq D&lt;/math&gt;, the
''closure'' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cl}_D(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest superset of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;
satisfying &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cl}(A) \leq D&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition '''A countable structure &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a ('''C''', &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;)-generic if:
* For &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq_\omega G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A \in \C&lt;/math&gt;.
* For &lt;math&gt;A \leq G&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;A \leq B&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; there is a strong embedding of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has finite closures:  for every &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq_\omega G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cl}_G(A)&lt;/math&gt; is finite.

'''Theorem ''' If ('''C''', &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;) has the amalgamation property, then there is a unique ('''C''', &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;)-generic.

The existence proof proceeds in imitation of the existence proof for
Fraïssé limits.  The uniqueness proof comes from an easy back and forth
argument.

In [[computer science]], '''incremental learning''' is a method of [[machine learning]], in which input data is continuously used to extend the existing model's knowledge i.e. to further train the model. It represents a dynamic technique of [[supervised learning]] and [[unsupervised learning]] that can be applied when training data becomes available gradually over time or its size is out of system memory limits. Algorithms that can facilitate incremental learning are known as incremental machine learning algorithms.

Many traditional machine learning algorithms inherently support incremental learning, other algorithms can be adapted to facilitate this. Examples of incremental algorithms include

The aim of incremental learning is for the learning model to adapt to new data without forgetting its existing knowledge, it does not retrain the model.  Some incremental learners have built-in some parameter or assumption that controls the relevancy of old data, while others, called stable incremental machine learning algorithms, learn representations of the training data that are not even partially forgotten over time. Fuzzy ART&lt;ref name="Fuzzy ART"&gt;Carpenter, G.A., Grossberg, S., &amp; Rosen, D.B., [http://dcommon.bu.edu/bitstream/handle/2144/2070/91.015.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Fuzzy ART: Fast stable learning and categorization of analog patterns by an adaptive resonance system], Neural Networks, 4(6): 759-771, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and TopoART&lt;ref name="TopoART" /&gt; are two examples for this second approach.

Incremental algorithms are frequently applied to [[data stream]]s or [[big data]], addressing issues in data availability and resource scarcity respectively. Stock trend prediction and user profiling are some examples of data streams where new data becomes continuously available.  Applying incremental learning to big data aims to produce faster [[statistical classification|classification]] or [[forecasting]] times.

'''James Eells''' (October 25, 1926, [[Cleveland, Ohio]] &amp;ndash; February 14, 2007, [[Cambridge]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]) was an American [[mathematician]], who specialized in [[mathematical analysis]].

==Biography==
Eells studied mathematics at [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Maine]] and earned his undergraduate degree in 1947. After graduation he spent one year teaching mathematics at [[Robert College]] in [[Istanbul]] and starting in 1948 was for two years an instructor at [[Amherst College]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]]. Next he undertook graduate study at [[Harvard University]], where in 1954 he received his [[Ph.D]] under [[Hassler Whitney]] with thesis ''Geometric Aspects of Integration Theory''. 

In the academic year 1955–1956 he was at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (and subsequently in 1962–1963, 1972–1973 and 1977). He taught at [[Columbia University]] for several years. In 1964 he became a full professor at [[Cornell University]]. In 1963 and in 1966–1967 he was at the [[University of Cambridge]], and after a visit to the new mathematics department developed by [[Erik Christopher Zeeman]] at the [[University of Warwick]] Eells became a professor of mathematical analysis there in 1969. Eells organized many of the University of Warwick Symposia in mathematics. 

In 1986 he became the first director of the mathematics section of the [[Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] in [[Trieste]]; for six years he served as director in addition to his appointment at the University of Warwick. In 1992 he retired and lived in [[Cambridge]].

Eells did research on global analysis, especially, [[harmonic map]]s on [[Riemannian manifold]]s, which are important in the theory of [[minimal surface]]s and [[theoretical physics]].  His doctoral students included [[John C. Wood]].

In 1970 he was an invited speaker at the [[International Mathematical Congress]] in [[Nice]] (''On Fredholm manifolds'' with K. D. Elworthy).

He was co-editor of the collected works of [[Hassler Whitney]]. Eells's doctoral students include [[Peter Štefan]] (1941 - 1978), Giorgio Valli (1960 - 1999) and {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre de la Harpe|de}}. Eells was married since 1950 and had a son and three daughters.

In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[calculus]], '''L'Hôpital's rule''' or '''L'Hospital's rule''' ({{IPA-fr|lopital|lang}}) uses [[derivative]]s to help evaluate [[limit of a function|limits]] involving [[indeterminate form]]s.  Application (or repeated application) of the rule often converts an indeterminate form to an expression that can be evaluated by substitution, allowing easier evaluation of the limit. The rule is named after the 17th-century [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] [[Guillaume de l'Hôpital]]. Although the contribution of the rule is often attributed to L'Hôpital, the theorem was first introduced to L'Hôpital in 1694 by the Swiss mathematician [[Johann Bernoulli]].

L'Hôpital's rule states that for functions {{math|{{var|f}}}} and {{math|{{var|g}}}} which are [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] on an open [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|{{var|I}}}} except possibly at a point {{math|{{var|c}}}} contained in {{math|{{var|I}}}}, if
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=\lim_{x\to c}g(x)=0 \text{ or } \pm\infty,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;g'(x)\ne 0&lt;/math&gt; for all {{math|{{var|x}}}} in {{math|{{var|I}}}} with {{math|1={{var|x}} ≠ {{var|c}}}}, and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}&lt;/math&gt; exists, then
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x\to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The differentiation of the numerator and denominator often simplifies the quotient or converts it to a limit that can be evaluated directly.

== History ==

[[Guillaume de l'Hôpital]] (also written l'Hospital{{efn|In the 17th and 18th centuries, the name was commonly spelled "l'Hospital", and he himself spelled his name that way. However, French spellings have [[Académie française|been altered]]: the silent 's' has been removed and replaced with the [[circumflex]] over the preceding vowel. The former spelling is still used in English where there is no circumflex.}}) published this rule in his 1696 book ''[[Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes]]'' (literal translation: ''Analysis of the Infinitely Small for the Understanding of Curved Lines''), the first textbook on [[differential calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/De_L'Hopital.html|title=De L'Hopital biography|first=John J.|last=O'Connor|author2=Robertson, Edmund F |work=The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews|location=Scotland|accessdate=21 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|1="Proposition I.

== General form ==
The general form of L'Hôpital's rule covers many cases. Let {{math|''c''}} and {{math|''L''}} be [[Extended real number line|extended real numbers]] (i.e., real numbers, positive infinity, or negative infinity). Let {{math|''I''}} be an [[open interval]] containing {{math|''c''}} (for a two-sided limit) or an open interval with endpoint {{math|''c''}} (for a [[one-sided limit]], or a [[limit at infinity]] if {{math|''c''}} is infinite). The real valued functions {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are assumed to be [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] on {{math|''I''}} except possibly at {{math|''c''}}, and additionally &lt;math&gt;g'(x)\ne 0&lt;/math&gt; on {{math|''I''}} except possibly at {{math|''c''}}. It is also assumed that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L.&lt;/math&gt; Thus the rule applies to situations in which the ratio of the derivatives has a finite or infinite limit, but not to situations in which that ratio fluctuates permanently as {{math|''x''}} gets closer and closer to {{math|''c''}}.

If either
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}f(x) = \lim_{x\to c}g(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}|f(x)| = \lim_{x\to c}|g(x)| = \infty,&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=L.&lt;/math&gt;
Although we have written ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr; ''c'' throughout, the limits may also be one-sided limits (''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr; ''c''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr; ''c''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;), when {{math|''c''}} is a finite endpoint of {{math|''I''}}.

In the second case, the hypothesis that {{math|''f''}} [[Divergent series|diverges]] to infinity is not used in the proof (see note at the end of the proof section); thus, while the conditions of the rule are normally stated as above, the second sufficient condition for the rule's procedure to be valid can be more briefly stated as &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}|g(x)| = \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The hypothesis that &lt;math&gt;g'(x)\ne 0&lt;/math&gt; appears most commonly in the literature, but some authors sidestep this hypothesis by adding other hypotheses elsewhere. One method&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Chatterjee|2005|loc=p. 291}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to define the limit of a function with the additional requirement that the limiting function is defined everywhere on the relevant interval {{math|''I''}} except possibly at {{math|''c''}}.{{efn|The functional analysis definition of the limit of a function does not require the existence of such an interval.}} Another method&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Krantz|2004|loc=p.79}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to require that both {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} be differentiable everywhere on an interval containing {{math|''c''}}.

== Requirement that the limit exist ==
The requirement that the limit

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

must exist is essential. Without this condition, &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;g'&lt;/math&gt; may exhibit undampened oscillations as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, in which case L'Hôpital's rule does not apply. For example, if &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x+\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g(x)=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c=\pm\infty&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}=\frac{1+\cos(x)}{1};&lt;/math&gt;

this expression does not approach a limit as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; goes to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, since the cosine function oscillates between {{math|1}} and {{math|−1}}. But working with the original functions, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; can be shown to exist:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{\sin(x)}{x}\right) = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

In a case such as this, all that can be concluded is that

: &lt;math&gt; \liminf_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \leq \liminf_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \leq \limsup_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \leq \limsup_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} ,&lt;/math&gt;

so that if the limit of ''f''/''g'' exists, then it must lie between the inferior and superior limits of ''f''&amp;prime;/''g''&amp;prime;.  (In the example above, this is true, since 1 indeed lies between 0 and 2.)

  \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x^2+x} &amp;= \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\frac{d}{dx}(e^x - 1)}{\frac{d}{dx}(x^2+x)} \\
  &amp;= \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{e^x}{2x+1} \\
  &amp;= 1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

* This is a more elaborate example involving {{sfrac|0|0}}. Applying L'Hôpital's rule a single time still results in an indeterminate form. In this case, the limit may be evaluated by applying the rule three times:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{2\sin(x)-\sin(2x)}{x-\sin(x)}}
&amp; =\lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{2\cos(x)-2\cos(2x)}{1-\cos(x)}} \\
&amp; = \lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{-2\sin(x)+4\sin(2x)}{\sin(x)}} \\
&amp; = \lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{-2\cos(x)+8\cos(2x)}{\cos(x)}} \\
&amp; ={\frac{-2+8}{1}} \\
&amp; =6.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

* Here is an example involving {{sfrac|∞|∞}}:

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}x^n\cdot e^{-x}
=\lim_{x\to\infty}{\frac{x^n}{e^x}}
=\lim_{x\to\infty}{\frac{nx^{n-1}}{e^x}}
=n\cdot \lim_{x\to\infty}{\frac{x^{n-1}}{e^x}}.&lt;/math&gt;

:Repeatedly apply L'Hôpital's rule until the exponent is zero (if {{mvar|n}} is an integer) or negative (if {{mvar|n}} is fractional) to conclude that the limit is zero.

* Here is an example involving the indeterminate form {{math|0 · ∞}} (see below), which is rewritten as the form {{sfrac|∞|∞}}:

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0^+}x \ln x =\lim_{x\to 0^+} \frac{\ln x}{\frac{1}{x}}
  = \lim_{x\to 0^+} \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{-\frac{1}{x^2}}
  = \lim_{x\to 0^+} -x = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

*Here is an example involving the [[Mortgage calculator#Monthly payment formula|Mortgage repayment formula]] and {{sfrac|0|0}}. Let {{math|''P''}} be the principal (loan amount), {{math|''r''}} the interest rate per period and {{math|''n''}} the number of periods.  When {{math|''r''}} is zero, the repayment amount per period is &lt;math&gt;\frac{P}{n}&lt;/math&gt; (since only principal is being repaid); this is consistent with the formula for non-zero interest rates:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\lim_{r\to 0}\frac{Pr(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n-1}
&amp; = P \lim_{r\to 0} \frac{(1+r)^n+rn(1+r)^{n-1}}{n(1+r)^{n-1}} \\
&amp; = \frac{P}{n}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

* One can also use L'Hôpital's rule to prove the following theorem. If {{math|''f''}} is differentiable in a neighborhood of {{math|''x''}}, and twice-differentiable at {{math|''x''}}, then

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)+f(x-h)-2f(x)}{h^2}
    &amp;= \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f'(x+h)-f'(x-h)}{2h} \\
    &amp;= \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f''(x+h) + f''(x-h)}{2} \\
    &amp;= f''(x).
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

*Sometimes L'Hôpital's rule is invoked in a tricky way: suppose {{math|''f''(''x'') + ''f''′(''x'')}} converges as {{math|''x'' → ∞}} and that &lt;math&gt;e^x\cdot f(x)&lt;/math&gt; converges to positive or negative infinity. Then:
::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x) = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{e^x\cdot f(x)}{e^x} = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{e^x\bigl(f(x)+f'(x)\bigr)}{e^x} = \lim_{x\to\infty}\bigl(f(x)+f'(x)\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;
:and so, &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; exists and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}f'(x) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
:The result remains true without the added hypothesis that &lt;math&gt;e^x\cdot f(x)&lt;/math&gt; converges to positive or negative infinity, but the justification is then incomplete.

== Complications ==
Sometimes L'Hôpital's rule does not lead to an answer in a finite number of steps unless some additional steps are applied. Examples include the following:

* Two applications can lead to a return to the original expression that was to be evaluated:

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}} = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} = \cdots .&lt;/math&gt;

:This situation can be dealt with by substituting &lt;math&gt;y=e^x&lt;/math&gt; and noting that {{math|''y''}} goes to infinity as {{math|''x''}} goes to infinity; with this substitution, this problem can be solved with a single application of the rule:

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} = \lim_{y\to\infty}\frac{y+y^{-1}}{y-y^{-1}} = \lim_{y\to\infty}\frac{1-y^{-2}}{1+y^{-2}} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

:Alternatively, the numerator and denominator can both be multiplied by &lt;math&gt;e^x,&lt;/math&gt; at which point L'Hôpital's rule can immediately be applied successfully:

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}} = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{e^{2x} + 1}{e^{2x} - 1} = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{2e^{2x}}{2e^{2x}} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

*An arbitrarily large number of applications may never lead to an answer even without repeating:

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{x^\frac1{2}+x^{-\frac1{2}}}{x^\frac1{2}-x^{-\frac1{2}}} = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\frac1{2}x^{-\frac1{2}}-\frac{1}{2}x^{-\frac3{2}}}{\frac1{2}x^{-\frac1{2}}+\frac1{2}x^{-\frac3{2}}} = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{-\frac1{4}x^{-\frac3{2}}+\frac3{4}x^{-\frac5{2}}}{-\frac1{4}x^{-\frac3{2}}-\frac3{4}x^{-\frac5{2}}} = \cdots .&lt;/math&gt;

:This situation too can be dealt with by a transformation of variables, in this case &lt;math&gt;y = \sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{x^\frac1{2}+x^{-\frac1{2}}}{x^\frac1{2}-x^{-\frac1{2}}} = \lim_{y\to\infty}\frac{y+y^{-1}}{y-y^{-1}} = \lim_{y\to\infty} \frac{1-y^{-2}}{1+y^{-2}} = \frac1{1} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

:Again, an alternative approach is to multiply numerator and denominator by &lt;math&gt;x^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; before applying L'Hôpital's rule:

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{x^\frac{1}{2}+x^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{x^\frac{1}{2}-x^{-\frac{1}{2}}} = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{x+1}{x-1} = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{1}{1} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

A common pitfall is using L'Hôpital's rule with some [[circular reasoning]] to compute a derivative via a [[Derivative#Definition via difference quotients|difference quotient]]. For example, consider the task of proving the derivative formula for [[Derivative#Computing the derivative|powers of ''x'']]:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{(x+h)^n-x^n}{h}=nx^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Applying L'Hôpital's rule and finding the derivatives with respect to {{math|''h''}} of the numerator and the denominator yields 
{{math|''n x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} as expected. However, differentiating the numerator required the use of the very fact that is being proven.  This is an example of [[begging the question]], since one may not assume the fact to be proven during the course of the proof.

== Counterexamples when the derivative of the denominator is zero ==
The necessity of the condition &lt;math&gt;g'(x)\ne 0&lt;/math&gt; can be seen by a counterexample due to [[Otto Stolz]]:&lt;ref name="stolz"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stolz |first=Otto |author-link=Otto Stolz |year=1879 |title=Ueber die Grenzwerthe der Quotienten |trans-title=About the limits of quotients |url=http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/img/?PID=GDZPPN002245159&amp;physid=phys570 |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] |language=German |volume=15 |pages=556–559 |doi=10.1007/bf02086277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choosing &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x+\sin x \cos x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g(x)=f(x)e^{\sin x}&lt;/math&gt;, there is no limit for &lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;. However, 
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = \frac{2\cos^2 x}{2\cos^2 x e^{\sin x} + (x+\sin x \cos x)\cos x e^{\sin x}} = \frac{2\cos x}{2 \cos x +x+\sin x \cos x} e^{-\sin x}, 
&lt;/math&gt;
which tends to 0 as &lt;math&gt;x\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Further examples of this type were found by [[Ralph P. Boas Jr.]]&lt;ref name="boas"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Boas Jr. |first=Ralph P.  |author-link=Ralph P. Boas Jr. |title=Counterexamples to L'Hopital's Rule |date=1986|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=93 |issue=8 |pages=644–645 |jstor=2322330 |doi=10.1080/00029890.1986.11971912 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other indeterminate forms ==
Other indeterminate forms, such as {{math|1&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|∞&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|0 · ∞}}, and {{math|∞ − ∞}}, can sometimes be evaluated using L'Hôpital's rule. For example, to evaluate a limit involving {{math|∞ − ∞}}, convert the difference of two functions to a quotient:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\lim_{x\to 1}\left(\frac{x}{x-1}-\frac1{\ln x}\right)
&amp; = \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x\cdot\ln x -x+1}{(x-1)\cdot\ln x} &amp; \quad (1) \\[6pt]
&amp; = \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{\ln x}{\frac{x-1}{x}+\ln x} &amp; \quad (2) \\[6pt]
&amp; = \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x\cdot\ln x}{x-1+x\cdot\ln x}     &amp; \quad (3) \\[6pt]
&amp; = \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{1+\ln x}{1+1+\ln x}     &amp; \quad (4) \\[6pt]
&amp; = \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{1+\ln x}{2+\ln x} \\[6pt]
&amp; = \frac{1}{2},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where L'Hôpital's rule is applied when going from (1) to (2) and again when going from (3) to (4).

L'Hôpital's rule can be used on indeterminate forms involving [[Exponentiation|exponents]] by using [[logarithm]]s to "move the exponent down". Here is an example involving the indeterminate form {{math|0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}:

:&lt;math&gt;
\lim_{x\to 0^+}x^x
= \lim_{x\to 0^+}e^{\ln (x^x)}
= \lim_{x\to 0^+}e^{x\cdot\ln x}
= e^{\lim\limits_{x\to 0^+}(x\cdot\ln x)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

It is valid to move the limit inside the [[exponential function]] because the exponential function is [[continuous function|continuous]]. Now the exponent &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has been "moved down". The limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0^+}x\cdot\ln x&lt;/math&gt; is of the indeterminate form {{math|0 · ∞}}, but as shown in an example above, l'Hôpital's rule may be used to determine that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0^+}x\cdot\ln x = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0^+}x^x = e^0 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

== Stolz–Cesàro theorem ==
{{Main article|Stolz–Cesàro theorem}}

The Stolz–Cesàro theorem is a similar result involving limits of sequences, but it uses finite [[difference operator]]s rather than [[derivative]]s.

== Geometric interpretation ==
Consider the curve in the plane whose {{math|''x''}}-coordinate is given by {{math|''g''(''t'')}} and whose {{math|''y''}}-coordinate is given by {{math|''f''(''t'')}}, with both functions continuous, i.e., the [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points of the form {{math|[''g''(''t''), ''f''(''t'')]}}. Suppose {{math|1=''f''(''c'') = ''g''(''c'') = 0}}. The limit of the ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''f''(''t'')|''g''(''t'')}}}} as {{math|''t'' → ''c''}} is the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point {{math|1=[''g''(''c''), ''f''(''c'')] = [0,0]}}. The tangent to the curve at the point {{math|[''g''(''t''), ''f''(''t'')]}} is given by {{math|[''g''′(''t''), ''f''′(''t'')]}}. L'Hôpital's rule then states that the slope of the curve when {{math|1=''t'' = ''c''}} is the limit of the slope of the tangent to the curve as the curve approaches the origin, provided that this is defined.

== Proof of L'Hôpital's rule ==

===Special case===
The proof of L'Hôpital's rule is simple in the case where {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are [[continuously differentiable]] at the point {{math|''c''}} and where a finite limit is found after the first round of differentiation. It is not a proof of the general L'Hôpital's rule because it is stricter in its definition, requiring both differentiability and that ''c'' be a real number. Since many common functions have continuous derivatives (e.g. [[polynomial]]s, [[sine]] and [[cosine]], [[exponential function]]s), it is a special case worthy of attention.

Suppose that {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are continuously differentiable at a real number {{math|''c''}}, that &lt;math&gt;f(c)=g(c)=0&lt;/math&gt;, and that &lt;math&gt;g'(c)\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)-0}{g(x)-0} = \lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{g(x)-g(c)} \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \lim_{x\to c}\frac{\left(\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}\right)}{\left(\frac{g(x)-g(c)}{x-c} \right)} = \frac{\lim\limits_{x\to c}\left(\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}\right)}{\lim\limits_{x\to c} \left(\frac{g(x)-g(c)}{x-c}\right)}= \frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)} = \lim_{x\to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This follows from the difference-quotient definition of the derivative. The last equality follows from the continuity of the derivatives at {{math|''c''}}. The limit in the conclusion is not indeterminate because &lt;math&gt;g'(c)\ne 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The proof of a more general version of L'Hôpital's rule is given below.

===General proof===
The following proof is due to {{harvtxt|Taylor|1952}}, where a unified proof for the {{sfrac|0|0}} and {{sfrac|±∞|±∞}} indeterminate forms is given. Taylor notes that different proofs may be found in {{harvtxt|Lettenmeyer|1936}} and {{harvtxt|Wazewski|1949}}.

Let ''f'' and ''g'' be functions satisfying the hypotheses in the [[L'hopital's rule#General form|General form]] section. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; be the open interval in the hypothesis with endpoint ''c''. Considering that &lt;math&gt;g'(x)\ne 0&lt;/math&gt; on this interval and ''g'' is continuous, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; can be chosen smaller so that ''g'' is nonzero on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;.{{efn|1=Since ''g' '' is nonzero and ''g'' is continuous on the interval, it is impossible for ''g'' to be zero more than once on the interval. If it had two zeros, the [[mean value theorem]] would assert the existence of a point ''p'' in the interval between the zeros such that ''g' ''(''p'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. So either ''g'' is already nonzero on the interval, or else the interval can be reduced in size so as not to contain the single zero of ''g''.}}

For each ''x'' in the interval, define &lt;math&gt;m(x)=\inf\frac{f'(\xi)}{g'(\xi)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M(x)=\sup\frac{f'(\xi)}{g'(\xi)}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; ranges over all values between ''x'' and ''c''. (The symbols inf and sup denote the [[infimum]] and [[supremum]].)

From the differentiability of ''f'' and ''g'' on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;, [[Cauchy's mean value theorem]] ensures that for any two distinct points ''x'' and ''y'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; there exists a &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; between ''x'' and ''y'' such that &lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)}=\frac{f'(\xi)}{g'(\xi)}&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, &lt;math&gt;m(x)\leq \frac{f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)} \leq M(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all choices of distinct ''x'' and ''y'' in the interval. The value ''g''(''x'')-''g''(''y'') is always nonzero for distinct ''x'' and ''y'' in the interval, for if it was not, the [[mean value theorem]] would imply the existence of a ''p'' between ''x'' and ''y'' such that ''g' ''(''p'')=0.

The definition of ''m''(''x'') and ''M''(''x'') will result in an extended real number, and so it is possible for them to take on the values ±∞.  In the following two cases, ''m''(''x'') and ''M''(''x'') will establish bounds on the ratio {{sfrac|''f''|''g''}}.

'''Case 1:''' &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=\lim_{x\to c}g(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;

For any ''x'' in the interval &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;, and point ''y'' between ''x'' and ''c'',
:&lt;math&gt;m(x)\le \frac{f(x)-f(y)}{g(x)-g(y)}=\frac{\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}-\frac{f(y)}{g(x)}}{1-\frac{g(y)}{g(x)}}\le M(x)&lt;/math&gt;
and therefore as ''y'' approaches ''c'', &lt;math&gt;\frac{f(y)}{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{g(y)}{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; become zero, and so
:&lt;math&gt;m(x)\leq\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\leq M(x).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Case 2:''' &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}|g(x)|=\infty&lt;/math&gt;

For every ''x'' in the interval &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;S_x=\{y\mid y \text{ is between } x \text{ and } c\}&lt;/math&gt;. For every point ''y'' between ''x'' and ''c'',
: &lt;math&gt;m(x)\le \frac{f(y)-f(x)}{g(y)-g(x)}=\frac{\frac{f(y)}{g(y)}-\frac{f(x)}{g(y)}}{1-\frac{g(x)}{g(y)}} \le M(x).&lt;/math&gt;

As ''y'' approaches ''c'', both &lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x)}{g(y)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{g(x)}{g(y)}&lt;/math&gt; become zero, and therefore
: &lt;math&gt;m(x)\le \liminf_{y\in S_x} \frac{f(y)}{g(y)} \le \limsup_{y\in S_x} \frac{f(y)}{g(y)} \le M(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The [[limit superior]] and [[limit inferior]] are necessary since the existence of the limit of {{sfrac|''f''|''g''}} has not yet been established.

It is also the case that 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}m(x)=\lim_{x\to c}M(x)=\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}=L.&lt;/math&gt;
{{efn|
The limits &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}m(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}M(x)&lt;/math&gt; both exist as they feature nondecreasing and nonincreasing functions of ''x'', respectively.

Consider a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_i\to c&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\lim_i m(x_i) \le \lim_i \frac{f'(x_i)}{g'(x_i)} \le \lim_i M(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;, as the inequality holds for each ''i''; this yields the inequalities &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}m(x) \le \lim_{x\to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \le \lim_{x\to c}M(x)&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to show &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}M(x) \le \lim_{x\to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, fix a sequence of numbers &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \lim_i \varepsilon_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_i\to c &lt;/math&gt;. For each ''i'',  choose &lt;math&gt;x_i &lt; y_i &lt; c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\frac{f'(y_i)}{g'(y_i)} + \varepsilon_i \ge \sup_{x_i &lt; \xi &lt; c}\frac{f'(\xi)}{g'(\xi)}&lt;/math&gt;, by the definition of &lt;math&gt;\sup&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;\lim_i M(x_i) \le \lim_i \frac{f'(y_i)}{g'(y_i)} + \varepsilon_i = \lim_i \frac{f'(y_i)}{g'(y_i)} + \lim_i \varepsilon_i = \lim_i \frac{f'(y_i)}{g'(y_i)}&lt;/math&gt; as desired.

The argument that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}m(x) \ge \lim_{x\to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}&lt;/math&gt; is similar.
}}
and
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\left(\liminf_{y\in S_x}\frac{f(y)}{g(y)}\right)=\liminf_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\left(\limsup_{y\in S_x} \frac{f(y)}{g(y)}\right)=\limsup_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}. &lt;/math&gt;

In case 1, the [[squeeze theorem]] establishes that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; exists and is equal to ''L''. In the case 2, and the squeeze theorem again asserts that &lt;math&gt;\liminf_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\limsup_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=L&lt;/math&gt;, and so the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; exists and is equal to ''L''. This is the result that was to be proven.

In case 2 the assumption that ''f''(''x'') diverges to infinity was not used within the proof. This means that if |''g''(''x'')| diverges to infinity as ''x'' approaches ''c'' and both ''f'' and ''g'' satisfy the hypotheses of L'Hôpital's rule, then no additional assumption is needed about the limit of ''f''(''x''): It could even be the case that the limit of ''f''(''x'') does not exist. In this case, L'Hopital's theorem is actually a consequence of Cesàro–Stolz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.imomath.com/index.php?options=686|website=IMOmath|publisher=[[International Mathematical Olympiad]]|title=L’Hopital’s Theorem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case when |''g''(''x'')| diverges to infinity as ''x'' approaches ''c'' and ''f''(''x'') converges to a finite limit at ''c'', then L'Hôpital's rule would be applicable, but not absolutely necessary, since basic limit calculus will show that the limit of ''f''(''x'')/''g''(''x'') as ''x'' approaches ''c'' must be zero.

== Corollary ==
A simple but very useful consequence of L'Hopital's rule is a well-known criterion for differentiability. It states the following:
suppose that ''f'' is continuous at ''a'', and that &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; exists for all ''x'' in some open interval containing ''a'', except perhaps for &lt;math&gt;x = a&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose, moreover, that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to a}f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; exists. Then &lt;math&gt;f'(a)&lt;/math&gt; also exists and
:&lt;math&gt;f'(a) = \lim_{x\to a}f'(x).&lt;/math&gt;
In particular, ''f''' is also continuous at ''a''.

===Proof===
Consider the functions &lt;math&gt;h(x) = f(x)-f(a)&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;g(x) = x-a&lt;/math&gt;. The continuity of ''f'' at ''a'' tells us that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to a}h(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to a}g(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; since a polynomial function is always continuous everywhere. Applying L'Hopital's rule shows that &lt;math&gt;f'(a) := \lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} = \lim_{x\to a}\frac{h(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x\to a}f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;!-- ==Conversion==
Informally L'Hôpital's rule states that if derivatives of functions are comparable, then functions themselves are also comparable. Conversion it not true for arbitrary functions, unless it is true in [[Hardy field]].--&gt;

Brouwer''' but known to his friends as '''Bertus''', was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]], who worked in [[topology]], [[set theory]], [[measure theory]] and [[complex analysis]].&lt;ref name="mathgene"&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=19467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Brouwer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=brouwer |title=Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer |last=Atten |first=Mark van}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder of the mathematical philosophy of [[intuitionism]].

==Biography==
Early in his career, Brouwer proved a number of theorems in the emerging field of topology. The most important were his [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem|fixed point theorem]], the topological invariance of degree, and the [[Invariance of domain|topological invariance of dimension]]. Among mathematicians generally, the best known is the first one, usually referred to now as the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem. It is a simple corollary to the second, concerning the topological invariance of degree, which is the best known among algebraic topologists. The third theorem is perhaps the hardest.

Brouwer also proved the [[simplicial approximation theorem]] in the foundations of [[algebraic topology]], which justifies the reduction to combinatorial terms, after sufficient subdivision of [[simplicial complex]]es, of the treatment of general continuous mappings. In 1912, at age 31, he was elected a member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00004406 |title=Luitzen E.J. Brouwer (1881 - 1966) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1908 at Rome&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, L. E. J. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858027749682;view=1up;seq=593 "Die mögliche Mächtigkeiten."] Atti IV Congr. Intern. Mat. Roma 3 (1908): 569–571.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1912 at Cambridge, UK.&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, L. E. J. (1912). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b90a/89587ec4436cb0a7d03124fea2430b7e8bdc.pdf Sur la notion de «Classe» de transformations d'une multiplicité]. Proc. 5th Intern. Math. Congr. Cambridge, 2, 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brouwer founded [[intuitionism]], a philosophy of mathematics that challenged the then-prevailing [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] of [[David Hilbert]] and his collaborators, who included [[Paul Bernays]], [[Wilhelm Ackermann]], and [[John von Neumann]] (cf. Kleene (1952), p.&amp;nbsp;46–59). A variety of [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]], intuitionism is a philosophy of the [[foundations of mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=L. E. J. Brouwer (trans. by Arnold Dresden)|title=Intuitionism and Formalism|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1913|volume=20|issue=2|pages=81–96|mr=1559427|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1913-02440-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes and rather simplistically characterized by saying that its adherents refuse to use the [[law of excluded middle]] in mathematical reasoning.

Brouwer was a member of the [[Significs Group]]. It formed part of the early history of [[semiotics]]—the study of symbols—around [[Victoria, Lady Welby]] in particular. The original meaning of his intuitionism probably can not be completely disentangled from the intellectual milieu of that group.

In 1905, at the age of 24, Brouwer expressed his philosophy of life in a short tract ''Life, Art and Mysticism'', which has been described by the mathematician [[Martin Davis]] as "drenched in romantic pessimism" (Davis (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;94). [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] had a formative influence on Brouwer, not least because he insisted that all concepts be fundamentally based on sense intuitions.&lt;ref&gt;"...Brouwer and Schopenhauer are in many respects two of a kind." Teun Koetsier, ''Mathematics and the Divine'', Chapter 30, "Arthur Schopenhauer and L.E.J. Brouwer: A Comparison," p. 584.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer wrote that "the original interpretation of the continuum of Kant and Schopenhauer as pure ''a priori'' intuition can in essence be upheld." (Quoted in Vladimir Tasić's ''Mathematics and the roots of postmodernist thought'', § 4.1, p. 36)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Brouwer’s debt to Schopenhauer is fully manifest. For both, Will is prior to Intellect." [see T. Koetsier. “Arthur Schopenhauer and L.E.J. Brouwer, a comparison,” Combined Proceedings for the Sixth and Seventh Midwest History of Mathematics Conferences, pages 272–290. Department of Mathematics, University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, La Crosse, 1998.]. (Mark van Atten and Robert Tragesser, “Mysticism and mathematics: Brouwer, Gödel, and the common core thesis,” Published in W. Deppert and M. Rahnfeld (eds.), Klarheit in Religionsdingen, Leipzig: Leipziger Universitätsverlag 2003, pp.145–160)&lt;/ref&gt; Brouwer then "embarked on a self-righteous campaign to reconstruct mathematical practice from the ground up so as to satisfy his philosophical convictions"; indeed his thesis advisor refused to accept his Chapter II "as it stands, ... all interwoven with some kind of pessimism and mystical attitude to life which is not mathematics, nor has anything to do with the foundations of mathematics" (Davis, p.&amp;nbsp;94 quoting van Stigt, p.&amp;nbsp;41). Nevertheless, in 1908:
: "... Brouwer, in a paper entitled 'The untrustworthiness of the principles of logic', challenged the belief that the rules of the classical logic, which have come down to us essentially from Aristotle (384--322 B.C.) have an absolute validity, independent of the subject matter to which they are applied" (Kleene (1952), p. 46).

"After completing his dissertation, Brouwer made a conscious decision to temporarily keep his contentious ideas under wraps and to concentrate on demonstrating his mathematical prowess" (Davis (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;95); by 1910 he had published a number of important papers, in particular the Fixed Point Theorem. Hilbert—the formalist with whom the intuitionist Brouwer would ultimately spend years in conflict—admired the young man and helped him receive a regular academic appointment (1912) at the University of Amsterdam (Davis, p.&amp;nbsp;96). It was then that "Brouwer felt free to return to his revolutionary project which he was now calling ''intuitionism'' " (ibid).

He was combative as a young man. He was involved in a very public and eventually demeaning controversy in the later 1920s with Hilbert over editorial policy at ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'', at that time a leading [[learned journal]]. He became relatively isolated; the development of intuitionism at its source was taken up by his student [[Arend Heyting]].

Dutch mathematician and historian of mathematics, [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden]] attended lectures given by Brouwer in later years, and commented: "Even though his most important research contributions were in topology, Brouwer never gave courses in topology, but always on—and only on—the foundations of his intuitionism. It seemed that he was no longer convinced of his results in topology because they were not correct from the point of view of intuitionism, and he judged everything he had done before, his greatest output, false according to his philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199703/interview.pdf|title=Interview with B L van der Waerden, reprinted in AMS March 1997 |publisher=American Mathematical Society |date= |accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About his last years, Davis (2002) remarks:
: "...he felt more and more isolated, and spent his last years under the spell of 'totally unfounded financial worries and a paranoid fear of bankruptcy, persecution and illness.' He was killed in 1966 at the age of 85, struck by a vehicle while crossing the street in front of his house." (Davis, p. 100 quoting van Stigt. p. 110.)

** 1925. [[A. N. Kolmogorov]]: "On the principle of excluded middle", pp.&amp;nbsp;414–437. Kolmogorov supports most of Brouwer's results but disputes a few; he discusses the ramifications of intuitionism with respect to "transfinite judgements", e.g. transfinite induction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3035">In [[mathematics]], the '''Marcinkiewicz&amp;ndash;Zygmund inequality''', named after [[Józef Marcinkiewicz]] and [[Antoni Zygmund]], gives relations between [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] of a collection of [[independent random variables]]. It is a generalization of the rule for the sum of [[variance]]s of independent random variables to moments of arbitrary order.

==Statement of the inequality==

'''Theorem''' &lt;ref name="Marcinkiewicz-1937-FI"&gt;J. Marcinkiewicz and A. Zygmund. Sur les foncions independantes. ''Fund. Math.'', 28:60&amp;ndash;90, 1937. Reprinted in Józef Marcinkiewicz, ''Collected papers'', edited by Antoni Zygmund, Panstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, Warsaw, 1964, pp. 233&amp;ndash;259.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chow-1988-PT"&gt;Yuan Shih Chow and Henry Teicher. ''Probability theory. Independence, interchangeability, martingales''. Springer-Verlag, New York, second edition, 1988.

&lt;/ref&gt; If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle i=1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;, are independent random variables such that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle E\left( X_{i}\right)  =0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle E\left(  \left\vert X_{i}\right\vert ^{p}\right) &lt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 1\leq p&lt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt; A_{p}E\left(  \left(  \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left\vert X_{i}\right\vert ^{2}\right) _{{}}^{p/2}\right)  \leq E\left(  \left\vert \sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right\vert ^{p}\right)  \leq B_{p}E\left(  \left(  \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left\vert X_{i}\right\vert ^{2}\right)  _{{}}^{p/2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A_{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B_{p}&lt;/math&gt; are positive constants, which depend only on &lt;math&gt;\textstyle p&lt;/math&gt;.

==The second-order case==

In the case &lt;math&gt;\textstyle p=2&lt;/math&gt;, the inequality holds with &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A_{2}=B_{2}=1&lt;/math&gt;, and it reduces to the rule for the sum of variances of independent random variables with zero mean, known from elementary statistics: If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle E\left( X_{i}\right)  =0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle E\left(  \left\vert X_{i}\right\vert ^{2}\right) &lt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Var}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)=E\left(  \left\vert \sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right\vert ^{2}\right)  =\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}E\left( X_{i}\overline{X}_{j}\right)  =\sum_{i=1}^{n}E\left(  \left\vert X_{i}\right\vert ^{2}\right)  =\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathrm{Var}\left(X_{i}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

Several similar moment inequalities are known as [[Khintchine inequality]] and [[Rosenthal inequalities]], and there are also extensions to more general symmetric [[statistic]]s of independent random variables.&lt;ref name="Ibragimov-1999-AKM"&gt;R.

Paterson is an expert on [[theoretical computer science]] with more than 100 publications, especially the design and analysis of [[algorithm]]s and [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]]. Paterson's distinguished career was recognised with the [[EATCS Award]] in 2006 and a workshop in honour of his 66th birthday in 2008, including contributions of several [[Turing Award]] and [[Gödel Prize]] laureates. For his work on [[distributed computing]] with [[Michael J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8550">'''Misorientation''' is the difference in [[Crystallography|crystallographic]] orientation between two [[Crystallite|crystallites]] in a polycrystalline material.

In crystalline materials, the orientation of a crystallite is defined by a transformation from a sample reference frame (i.e. defined by the direction of a rolling or extrusion process and two orthogonal directions) to the local reference frame of the crystalline lattice, as defined by the basis of the [[unit cell]].  In the same way, misorientation is the transformation necessary to move from one local crystal frame to some other crystal frame.  That is, it is the distance in orientation space between two distinct orientations.  If the orientations are specified in terms of matrices of direction cosines g&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and g&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, then the misorientation operator ∆g&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt; going from A to B can be defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{B}=\Delta g_{AB} g_{A}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_{AB}=g_{B}g_{A}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where the term g&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is the reverse operation of g&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, that is, transformation from crystal frame A back to the sample frame.  This provides an alternate description of misorientation as the successive operation of transforming from the first crystal frame (A) back to the sample frame and subsequently to the new crystal frame (B).

Various methods can be used to represent this transformation operation, such as: [[Euler angles]], Rodrigues vectors, [[axis angle|axis/angle]] (where the axis is specified as a crystallographic direction), or [[Quaternions and spatial rotation|unit quaternions]].

== Symmetry and misorientation ==
The effect of [[crystal symmetry]] on misorientations is to reduce the fraction of the full orientation space necessary to uniquely represent all possible misorientation relationships.  For example, cubic crystals (i.e. FCC) have 24 symmetrically related orientations.  Each of these orientations is physically indistinguishable, though mathematically distinct.  Therefore, the size of orientation space is reduced by a factor of 24.  This defines the '''fundamental zone''' (FZ) for cubic symmetries.  For the misorientation between two cubic crystallites, each possesses its 24 inherent symmetries.  In addition, there exists a switching symmetry, defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_{AB}=\Delta g_{BA}&lt;/math&gt;
which recognizes the invariance of misorientation to direction; A→B or B→A.  The fraction of the total orientation space in the cubic-cubic fundamental zone for misorientation is then given by:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{24\cdot24\cdot2}=\frac{1}{1152}&lt;/math&gt;
or 1/48 the volume of the cubic fundamental zone.  This also has the effect of limiting the maximum unique misorientation angle to 62.8°&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Disorientation''' describes the misorientation with the smallest possible rotation angle out of all symmetrically equivalent misorientations that fall within the FZ (usually specified as having an axis in the standard stereographic triangle for cubics).  Calculation of these variants involves application of crystal symmetry operators to each of the orientations during the calculation of misorientation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_{AB}=O_{B}^{crys}g_{B}(O_{A}^{crys}g_{A})^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
where O&lt;sup&gt;crys&lt;/sup&gt; denotes one of the symmetry operators for the material.

== Misorientation distribution ==
[[Image:MDF rodrigues AA5083.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Example MDF shown in Rodrigues space for a sample of AA5083 plate]]

The misorientation distribution (MD) is analogous to the [[Orientation distribution function|ODF]] used in characterizing texture.  The MD describes the probability of the misorientation between any two grains falling into a range &lt;math&gt;d \Delta g&lt;/math&gt; around a given misorientation &lt;math&gt;\Delta g&lt;/math&gt;.  While similar to a probability density, the MD is not mathematically the same due to the normalization.  The intensity in a MD is given as "multiples of random density" (MRD) with respect to the distribution expected in a material with uniformly distributed misorientations.  The MD can be calculated by either series expansion, typically using generalized [[spherical harmonics]], or by a discrete binning scheme, where each data point is assigned to a bin and accumulated.

== Graphical representation ==
[[Image:Mackenzie plot.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Distribution of misorientation angles for a randomly texture polycrystal, from Mackenzie(1958)]]

Discrete misorientations or the misorientation distribution can be fully described as plots in the Euler angle, axis/angle, or Rodrigues vector space.  Unit quaternions, while computationally convenient, do not lend themselves to graphical representation because of their four-dimensional nature.  For any of the representations, plots are usually constructed as sections through the fundamental zone; along φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in Euler angles, at increments of rotation angle for axis/angle, and at constant ρ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (parallel to &lt;001&gt;) for Rodrigues.   Due to the irregular shape of the cubic-cubic FZ, the plots are typically given as sections through the cubic FZ with the more restrictive boundaries overlaid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mackenzie plots are a one-dimensional representation of the MD plotting the relative frequency of the misorientation angle, irrespective of the axis.  Mackenzie determined the misorientation distribution for a cubic sample with a random texture.

== Example of calculating misorientation ==
The following is an example of the algorithm for determining the axis/angle representation of misorientation between two texture components given as Euler angles:
:Copper [90,35,45]
:S3 [59,37,63]
The first step is converting the Euler angle representation to an orientation matrix ''g'' by:
&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
c\phi_{1}c\phi_{2}-s\phi_{1}s\phi_{2}c\Phi &amp; s\phi_{1}c\phi_{2}+c\phi_{1}s\phi_{2}c\Phi  &amp; s\phi_{2}s\Phi\\ 
-c\phi_{1}s\phi_{2}-s\phi_{1}c\phi_{2}c\Phi &amp; -s\phi_{1}s\phi_{2}+c\phi_{1}c\phi_{2}c\Phi &amp; c\phi_{2}s\Phi\\ 
s\phi_{1}s\Phi &amp; -c\phi_{1}s\Phi &amp; c\Phi 
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''''c''''' and '''''s''''' represent ''cosine'' and ''sine'', respectively.  This yields the following orientation matrices:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_{copper}=\begin{bmatrix}
-0.579 &amp; 0.707 &amp; 0.406 \\
-0.579 &amp; -0.707 &amp; 0.406 \\
0.574 &amp; 0 &amp; 0.819 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_{S3}=\begin{bmatrix}
-0.376 &amp; 0.756 &amp; 0.536 \\
-0.770 &amp; -0.577 &amp; 0.273 \\
0.516 &amp; -0.310 &amp; 0.799 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
The misorientation is then:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_{AB}=g_{copper}g_{S3}^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}
0.970 &amp; 0.149 &amp; -0.194 \\
-0.099 &amp; 0.965 &amp; 0.244 \\
0.224 &amp; -0.218 &amp; 0.950 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
The axis/angle description (with the axis as a unit vector) is related to the misorientation matrix by:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;cos\Theta=(g_{11}+g_{22}+g_{33}-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_{1}=(g_{23}-g_{32})/(2sin\Theta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_{2}=(g_{31}-g_{13})/(2sin\Theta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_{3}=(g_{12}-g_{21})/(2sin\Theta)&lt;/math&gt;
(There are errors in the similar formulae for the components of 'r' given in the book by Randle and Engler (see refs.), which will be corrected in the next edition of their book. The above are the correct versions, note a different form for these equations has to be used if Theta = 180 degrees.)

For the copper—S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; misorientation given by Δg&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;, the axis/angle description is 19.5° about [0.689,0.623,0.369], which is only 2.3° from &lt;221&gt;.  This result is only one of the 1152 symmetrically related possibilities but does specify the disorientation.  This can be verified by considering all possible combinations of orientation symmetry (including switching symmetry).

In [[game theory]], an '''open-loop model''' is the one where players cannot observe the play of their opponents, as opposed to a closed-loop model, where all past play is [[common knowledge]]. The solution to an open-loop model is called "open-loop equilibrium".

Open loop models are more tractable, which is why they are sometimes preferred to closed-loop models even when the latter is a better description of reality.

In [[mathematics]], a '''partial derivative''' of a [[function (mathematics)#MULTIVARIATE FUNCTION|function of several variables]] is its [[derivative]] with respect to one of those variables, with the others held constant (as opposed to the [[total derivative]], in which all variables are allowed to vary). Partial derivatives are used in [[vector calculus]] and [[differential geometry]].

The partial derivative of a function &lt;math&gt;f(x, y, \dots)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is variously denoted by

: &lt;math&gt;f'_x, f_x, \partial_x f,\ D_xf, D_1f, \frac{\partial}{\partial x}f, \text{ or } \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes, for &lt;math&gt;z=f(x, y, \ldots),&lt;/math&gt; the partial derivative of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is denoted as &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial z}{\partial x}.&lt;/math&gt; Since a partial derivative generally has the same arguments as the original function, its functional dependence is sometimes explicitly signified by the notation, such as in:

:&lt;math&gt;f_x(x, y, \ldots), \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} (x, y, \ldots).&lt;/math&gt;

The symbol used to denote partial derivatives is [[∂]]. One of the first known uses of this symbol in mathematics is by [[Marquis de Condorcet]] from 1770, who used it for partial differences. The modern partial derivative notation was created by [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] (1786), though he later abandoned it; [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]] reintroduced the symbol again in 1841.&lt;ref name="jeff_earliest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/calculus.html|title=Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus| first=Jeff| last=Miller|date=2009-06-14|work=Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols|accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Suppose that ''f'' is a function of more than one variable. For instance,

:&lt;math&gt;z = f(x,y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.&lt;/math&gt;

{{multiple image
 | align  = right
 | direction = vertical
 | width  = 250

 | image1 = Partial func eg.svg
 | caption1 = A graph of {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''xy'' + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. For the partial derivative at {{nowrap|(1, 1)}} that leaves ''y'' constant, the corresponding [[tangent]] line is parallel to the ''xz''-plane.

 | image2 = X2+X+1.svg
 | caption2 = A slice of the graph above showing the function in the ''xz''-plane at {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} 1}}. Note that the two axes are shown here with different scales. The slope of the tangent line is 3.
}}

The [[graph of a function|graph]] of this function defines a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] in [[Euclidean space]]. To every point on this surface, there are an infinite number of [[tangent line]]s. Partial differentiation is the act of choosing one of these lines and finding its [[slope]]. Usually, the lines of most interest are those that are parallel to the &lt;math&gt;xz&lt;/math&gt;-plane, and those that are parallel to the ''yz''-plane (which result from holding either ''y'' or ''x'' constant, respectively.)

To find the slope of the line tangent to the function at &lt;math&gt;P(1, 1)&lt;/math&gt; and parallel to the &lt;math&gt;xz&lt;/math&gt;-plane, we treat &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as a constant. The graph and this plane are shown on the right. Below, we see how the function looks on the plane &lt;math&gt;y=1&lt;/math&gt; . By finding the [[derivative]] of the equation while assuming that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, we find that the slope of ''&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;'' at the point &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; is:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = 2x+y.&lt;/math&gt;

So at &lt;math&gt;(1, 1)&lt;/math&gt;, by substitution, the slope is 3. Therefore,

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = 3&lt;/math&gt;

at the point &lt;math&gt;(1, 1)&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the partial derivative of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;(1, 1)&lt;/math&gt; is 3, as shown in the graph.

==Definition==

=== Basic definition ===
The function ''f'' can be reinterpreted as a family of functions of one variable indexed by the other variables:

: &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = f_y(x) = x^2 + xy + y^2.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, every value of ''y'' defines a function, denoted ''f&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' , which is a function of one variable ''x''.{{efn|This can also be expressed as the [[adjoint functors|adjointness]] between the [[product topology|product space]] and [[function space]] constructions.}} That is,

: &lt;math&gt;f_y(x) = x^2 + xy + y^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in this section the subscript notation ''f&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes a function contingent on a fixed value of ''y'', and not a partial derivative.

Once a value of ''y'' is chosen, say ''a'', then ''f''(''x'',''y'') determines a function ''f&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' which traces a curve ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''ax'' + ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on the &lt;math&gt;xz&lt;/math&gt;-plane:

: &lt;math&gt;f_a(x) = x^2 + ax + a^2. &lt;/math&gt;

In this expression, ''a'' is a ''constant'', not a ''variable'', so ''f&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a function of only one real variable, that being ''x''. Consequently, the definition of the derivative for a function of one variable applies:

: &lt;math&gt;f_a'(x) = 2x + a.&lt;/math&gt;

The above procedure can be performed for any choice of ''a''. Assembling the derivatives together into a function gives a function which describes the variation of ''f'' in the ''x'' direction:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y) = 2x + y.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the partial derivative of ''f'' with respect to ''x''. Here ∂ is a rounded ''d'' called the '''partial derivative symbol'''. To distinguish it from the letter ''d'', ∂ is sometimes pronounced "tho" or "partial".

In general, the '''partial derivative''' of an [[Arity|n-ary]] function ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in the direction ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' at the point (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') is defined to be:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(a_1, \ldots, a_i+h,\ldots,a_n) - f(a_1,\ldots, a_i, \dots,a_n)}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the above difference quotient, all the variables except ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are held fixed. That choice of fixed values determines a function of one variable

:&lt;math&gt;f_{a_1,\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\ldots,a_n}(x_i) = f(a_1,\ldots,a_{i-1},x_i,a_{i+1},\ldots,a_n),&lt;/math&gt;

and by definition,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{df_{a_1,\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\ldots,a_n}}{dx_i}(a_i) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(a_1,\ldots,a_n).&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the different choices of ''a'' index a family of one-variable functions just as in the example above. This expression also shows that the computation of partial derivatives reduces to the computation of one-variable derivatives.

An important example of a function of several variables is the case of a [[scalar-valued function]] ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') on a domain in Euclidean space &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; (e.g., on &lt;math&gt;\R^2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\R^3&lt;/math&gt;). In this case ''f'' has a partial derivative ∂''f''/∂''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' with respect to each variable ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. At the point ''a'', these partial derivatives define the vector

: &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(a) = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}(a), \ldots, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}(a)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This vector is called the '''[[gradient]]''' of ''f'' at ''a''. If ''f'' is differentiable at every point in some domain, then the gradient is a vector-valued function ∇''f'' which takes the point ''a'' to the vector ∇''f''(''a''). Consequently, the gradient produces a [[vector field]].

A common [[abuse of notation]] is to define the [[del operator]] (∇) as follows in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\R^3&lt;/math&gt; with [[unit vectors]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{i}}, \hat{\mathbf{j}}, \hat{\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\nabla = \left[{\frac{\partial}{\partial x}} \right] \hat{\mathbf{i}} + \left[{\frac{\partial}{\partial y}} \right] \hat{\mathbf{j}} + \left[{\frac{\partial}{\partial z}}\right] \hat{\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt;

Or, more generally, for ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; with coordinates &lt;math&gt;x_1, \ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt; and unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{e}}_1, \ldots, \hat{\mathbf{e}}_n&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\nabla = \sum_{j=1}^n \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \right] \hat{\mathbf{e}}_j = \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1} \right] \hat{\mathbf{e}}_1 + \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x_2} \right] \hat{\mathbf{e}}_2 + \ldots + \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n} \right] \hat{\mathbf{e}}_n&lt;/math&gt;

===Formal definition===
Like ordinary derivatives, the partial derivative is defined as a [[limit of a function|limit]]. Let ''U'' be an [[open set|open subset]] of &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f:U\to\R&lt;/math&gt; a function. The partial derivative of ''f'' at the point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}=(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \in U&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the ''i''-th variable ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial }{\partial x_i }f(\mathbf{a}) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a_1, \ldots , a_{i-1}, a_i+h, a_{i+1}, \ldots ,a_n) -
f(a_1, \ldots, a_i, \dots ,a_n)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

Even if all partial derivatives ∂''f''/∂''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'') exist at a given point ''a'', the function need not be [[continuous function|continuous]] there. However, if all partial derivatives exist in a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of ''a'' and are continuous there, then ''f'' is [[total derivative|totally differentiable]] in that neighborhood and the total derivative is continuous. In this case, it is said that ''f'' is a C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; function. This can be used to generalize for vector valued functions, &lt;math&gt;f:U \to \R^m,&lt;/math&gt; by carefully using a componentwise argument.

The partial derivative &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt; can be seen as another function defined on ''U'' and can again be partially differentiated. If all mixed second order partial derivatives are continuous at a point (or on a set), ''f'' is termed a C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; function at that point (or on that set); in this case, the partial derivatives can be exchanged by [[Symmetry of second derivatives#Clairaut.27s theorem|Clairaut's theorem]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} = \frac{\partial^2f} {\partial x_j \partial x_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

===Geometry===
[[Image:Cone 3d.png|thumb|The volume of a cone depends on height and radius]]
The [[volume]] ''V'' of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]] depends on the cone's [[height]] ''h'' and its [[radius]] ''r'' according to the formula

:&lt;math&gt;V(r, h) = \frac{\pi r^2 h}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

The partial derivative of ''V'' with respect to ''r'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \partial V}{\partial r} = \frac{ 2 \pi r h}{3},&lt;/math&gt;

which represents the rate with which a cone's volume changes if its radius is varied and its height is kept constant. The partial derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi r^2}{3},&lt;/math&gt; which represents the rate with which the volume changes if its height is varied and its radius is kept constant.

By contrast, the [[total derivative|''total'' derivative]] of ''V'' with respect to ''r'' and ''h'' are respectively

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dV}{dr} = \overbrace{\frac{2 \pi r h}{3}}^\frac{ \partial V}{\partial r} + \overbrace{\frac{\pi r^2}{3}}^\frac{ \partial V}{\partial h}\frac{dh}{dr}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dV}{dh} = \overbrace{\frac{\pi r^2}{3}}^\frac{\partial V}{\partial h} + \overbrace{\frac{2 \pi r h}{3}}^\frac{ \partial V}{\partial r}\frac{dr}{dh}&lt;/math&gt;

The difference between the total and partial derivative is the elimination of indirect dependencies between variables in partial derivatives.

If (for some arbitrary reason) the cone's proportions have to stay the same, and the height and radius are in a fixed ratio ''k'',

:&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{h}{r} = \frac{dh}{dr}.&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the total derivative with respect to ''r'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dV}{dr} = \frac{2 \pi r h}{3} + \frac{\pi r^2}{3}k&lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dV}{dr} = k \pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the total derivative with respect to ''h'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dV}{dh} = \pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;

The total derivative with respect to ''both'' r and h of the volume intended as scalar function of these two variables is given by the [[gradient]] vector 

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla V = \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial r},\frac{\partial V}{\partial h}\right) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\pi rh, \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Optimization===

Partial derivatives appear in any calculus-based [[optimization]] problem with more than one choice variable. For example, in [[economics]] a firm may wish to maximize [[profit (economics)|profit]] π(''x'', ''y'') with respect to the choice of the quantities ''x'' and ''y'' of two different types of output. The [[first order condition]]s for this optimization are π&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 = π&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;. Since both partial derivatives π&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and π&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; will generally themselves be functions of both arguments ''x'' and ''y'', these two first order conditions form a [[System of equations|system of two equations in two unknowns]].

===Thermodynamics and mathematical physics===

Partial derivatives appear in thermodynamic equations like [[Gibbs-Duhem equation]] as well in other equations from [[mathematical physics]]. Here the variables being held constant in partial derivatives can be ratio of simple variables like [[mole fraction]]s ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the following example involving the Gibbs energies in a ternary mixture system:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{G_2}= G + (1-x_2) \left(\frac{{\partial G}}{{\partial x_2}}\right)_{\frac{x_1}{x_3}} &lt;/math&gt;

Express [[mole fraction]]s of a component as functions of other components mole fraction and binary mole ratios:

:&lt;math&gt;x_1 = \frac{1-x_2}{1+\frac{x_3}{x_1}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_3 = \frac{1-x_2}{1+\frac{x_1}{x_3}}&lt;/math&gt;

Differential quotients can be formed at constant ratios like those above:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial x_1}{\partial x_2}\right)_{\frac{x_1}{x_3}} = - \frac{x_1}{1-x_2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial x_3}{\partial x_2}\right)_{\frac{x_1}{x_3}} = - \frac{x_3}{1-x_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Ratios X, Y, Z of mole fractions can be written for ternary and multicomponent systems:

:&lt;math&gt;X = \frac{x_3}{x_1 + x_3}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y = \frac{x_3}{x_2 + x_3}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{x_2}{x_1 + x_2}&lt;/math&gt;

which can be used for solving [[partial differential equation]]s like:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial \mu_2}{\partial n_1}\right)_{n_2, n_3} = \left(\frac{\partial \mu_1}{\partial n_2}\right)_{n_1, n_3}&lt;/math&gt;

This equality can be rearranged to have differential quotient of mole fractions on one side.

===Image resizing===

Partial derivatives are key to target-aware image resizing algorithms. Widely known as [[seam carving]], these algorithms require each [[pixel]] in an image to be assigned a numerical 'energy' to describe their dissimilarity against orthogonal adjacent pixels. The [[algorithm]] then progressively removes rows or columns with the lowest energy. The formula established to determine a pixel's energy (magnitude of [[gradient]] at a pixel) depends heavily on the constructs of partial derivatives.

===Economics===

Partial derivatives play a prominent role in [[economics]], in which most functions describing economic behaviour posit that the behaviour depends on more than one variable. For example, a societal [[consumption function]] may describe the amount spent on consumer goods as depending on both income and wealth; the [[marginal propensity to consume]] is then the partial derivative of the consumption function with respect to income.

==Notation==
For the following examples, let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a function in &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.

First-order partial derivatives:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \partial f}{ \partial x} = f_x = \partial_x f.&lt;/math&gt;

Second-order partial derivatives:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \partial^2 f}{ \partial x^2} = f_{xx} = \partial_{xx} f = \partial_x^2 f.&lt;/math&gt;

Second-order [[mixed derivatives]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \right) = (f_{x})_{y} = f_{xy} = \partial_{yx} f = \partial_y \partial_x f.&lt;/math&gt;

Higher-order partial and mixed derivatives:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^{i+j+k} f}{\partial x^i \partial y^j \partial z^k } = f^{(i, j, k)} = \partial_x^i \partial_y^j \partial_z^k f.&lt;/math&gt;

When dealing with functions of multiple variables, some of these variables may be related to each other, thus it may be necessary to specify explicitly which variables are being held constant to avoid ambiguity. In fields such as [[statistical mechanics]], the partial derivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, holding &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; constant, is often expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \right)_{y,z}.&lt;/math&gt;

Conventionally, for clarity and simplicity of notation, the partial derivative ''function'' and the ''value'' of the function at a specific point are [[Abuse of notation|conflated]] by including the function arguments when the partial derivative symbol (Leibniz notation) is used. Thus, an expression like 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f(x,y,z)}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt; 

is used for the function, while 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f(u,v,w)}{\partial u}&lt;/math&gt; 

might be used for the value of the function at the point &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)=(u,v,w)&lt;/math&gt;. However, this convention breaks down when we want to evaluate the partial derivative at a point like &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)=(17, u+v, v^2)&lt;/math&gt;. In such a case, evaluation of the function must be expressed in an unwieldy manner as 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f(x,y,z)}{\partial x}(17, u+v, v^2)&lt;/math&gt; 

or 

:&lt;math&gt;\left. \frac{\partial f(x,y,z)}{\partial x}\right |_{(x,y,z)=(17, u+v, v^2)}&lt;/math&gt; 

in order to use the Leibniz notation. Thus, in these cases, it may be preferable to use the Euler differential operator notation with &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; as the partial derivative symbol with respect to the ''i''th variable. For instance, one would write &lt;math&gt;D_1 f(17, u+v, v^2)&lt;/math&gt; for the example described above, while the expression &lt;math&gt;D_1 f&lt;/math&gt; represents the partial derivative ''function'' with respect to the 1st variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/SpivakM.CalculusOnManifoldsPerseus2006Reprint| title=Calculus on Manifolds| last=Spivak| first=M.| publisher=W. A. Benjamin, Inc.|year=1965|isbn=9780805390216|location=New York|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For higher order partial derivatives, the partial derivative (function) of &lt;math&gt;D_i f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the ''j''th variable is denoted &lt;math&gt;D_j(D_i f)=D_{i,j} f&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;D_j\circ D_i =D_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;, so that the variables are listed in the order in which the derivatives are taken, and thus, in reverse order of how the composition of operators is usually notated. Of course, [[Clairaut's theorem on equality of mixed partials|Clairaut's theorem]] implies that &lt;math&gt;D_{i,j}=D_{j,i}&lt;/math&gt; as long as comparatively mild regularity conditions on ''f'' are satisfied.

==Antiderivative analogue==
There is a concept for partial derivatives that is analogous to [[antiderivative]]s for regular derivatives. Given a partial derivative, it allows for the partial recovery of the original function.

Consider the example of 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = 2x+y.&lt;/math&gt;

The "partial" integral can be taken with respect to ''x'' (treating ''y'' as constant, in a similar manner to partial differentiation):

:&lt;math&gt;z = \int \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \,dx = x^2 + xy + g(y)&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the [[Constant of integration|"constant" of integration]] is no longer a constant, but instead a function of all the variables of the original function except ''x''. The reason for this is that all the other variables are treated as constant when taking the partial derivative, so any function which does not involve &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will disappear when taking the partial derivative, and we have to account for this when we take the antiderivative. The most general way to represent this is to have the "constant" represent an unknown function of all the other variables.

Thus the set of functions &lt;math&gt;x^2 + xy + g(y)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''g'' is any one-argument function, represents the entire set of functions in variables ''x'',''y'' that could have produced the ''x''-partial derivative &lt;math&gt;2x + y&lt;/math&gt;.

If all the partial derivatives of a function are known (for example, with the [[gradient]]), then the antiderivatives can be matched via the above process to reconstruct the original function up to a constant. Unlike in the single-variable case, however, not every set of functions can be the set of all (first) partial derivatives of a single function. In other words, not every vector field is [[Conservative vector field|conservative]].

==Higher order partial derivatives==

Second and higher order partial derivatives are defined analogously to the higher order derivatives of univariate functions. For the function &lt;math&gt;f(x, y, ...)&lt;/math&gt; the "own" second partial derivative with respect to ''x'' is simply the partial derivative of the partial derivative (both with respect to ''x''):&lt;ref&gt;[[Alpha Chiang|Chiang, Alpha C.]] ''Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics'', McGraw-Hill, third edition, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|316–318}}

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x^2} \equiv \partial \frac{{\partial f / \partial x}}{{\partial x}} \equiv \frac{{\partial f_x }}{{\partial x }} \equiv f_{xx}.&lt;/math&gt;

The cross partial derivative with respect to ''x'' and ''y'' is obtained by taking the partial derivative of ''f'' with respect to ''x'', and then taking the partial derivative of the result with respect to ''y'', to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 f}}{{\partial y\, \partial x}} \equiv \partial \frac{{\partial f / \partial x}}{{\partial y}} \equiv \frac{{\partial f_x}}{{\partial y}} \equiv f_{{xy}}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Schwarz theorem|Schwarz's theorem]] states that if the second derivatives are continuous the expression for the cross partial derivative is unaffected by which variable the partial derivative is taken with respect to first and which is taken second. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {{\partial ^2 f}}{{\partial x\, \partial y}} = \frac{{\partial ^2 f}}{{\partial y\, \partial x}}&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently &lt;math&gt;f_{{xy}}=f_{{yx}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Own and cross partial derivatives appear in the [[Hessian matrix]] which is used in the [[second order condition]]s in [[optimization]] problems.

In [[mathematics]], a '''plane''' is a flat, two-[[dimension]]al [[surface (topology)|surface]] that extends infinitely far. A plane is the [[two-dimensional space|two-dimensional analogue]] of a [[point (geometry)|point]] (zero dimensions), a [[line (geometry)|line]] (one dimension) and [[three-dimensional space]]. Planes can arise as subspaces of some higher-dimensional space, as with a room's walls extended infinitely far, or they may enjoy an independent existence in their own right, as in the setting of [[Euclidean geometry]].

When working exclusively in two-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], the definite article is used, so, ''the'' plane refers to the whole space. Many fundamental tasks in mathematics, [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], [[graph theory]], and [[graph of a function|graphing]] are performed in a two-dimensional space, or, in other words, in the plane.

==Euclidean geometry==
{{Main|Euclidean geometry}}

[[Euclid]] set forth the first great landmark of mathematical thought, an axiomatic treatment of geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc= pg. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He selected a small core of undefined terms (called ''common notions'') and postulates (or [[axiom]]s) which he then used to prove various geometrical statements. Although the plane in its modern sense is not directly given a definition anywhere in the ''Elements'', it may be thought of as part of the common notions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|accessdate= 8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid never used numbers to measure length, angle, or area. In this way the Euclidean plane is not quite the same as the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] plane.
&lt;!--In higher-dimensional Euclidean space, a plane inside this space can be uniquely determined by any of the following sets of objects:

*three [[non-collinear points]] (i.e. not lying on the same [[line (mathematics)|line]])
*a line and a point not on the line
*two distinct intersecting lines --&gt;

[[File:Planes parallel.svg|thumb|right|150px|Three parallel planes.]]
&lt;!--In 3 dimensional Euclidean space, planes, like [[line (geometry)|line]]s, can be [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] or intersecting. Lines drawn on two parallel planes will either be parallel or [[skew lines|skew]] but will not intersect. Intersecting planes may be [[perpendicular]] or may form any number of other angles. In Euclidean spaces of more than 3 dimensions, it is possible to have two planes that intersect in a single point.--&gt;

A plane is a [[ruled surface]].

==Planes embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space==
This section is solely concerned with planes embedded in three dimensions: specifically, in [[Cartesian product|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]].

===Determination by contained points and lines===
In a Euclidean space of any number of dimensions, a plane is uniquely determined by any of the following:
*Three non-[[collinear]] points (points not on a single line).
*A line and a point not on that line.
*Two distinct but intersecting lines.
*Two [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines.

===Properties===
The following statements hold in three-dimensional Euclidean space but not in higher dimensions, though they have higher-dimensional analogues:

*Two distinct planes are either parallel or they intersect in a [[line (geometry)|line]].
*A line is either parallel to a plane, intersects it at a single point, or is contained in the plane.
*Two distinct lines [[perpendicular]] to the same plane must be parallel to each other.
*Two distinct planes perpendicular to the same line must be parallel to each other.

===Point-normal form and general form of the equation of a plane===
In a manner analogous to the way lines in a two-dimensional space are described using a point-slope form for their equations, planes in a three dimensional space have a natural description using a point in the plane and a vector orthogonal to it (the [[normal vector]]) to indicate its "inclination".

Specifically, let {{math|'''''r'''''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the position vector of some point {{math|1=''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and let {{math|1='''''n''''' = (''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}} be a nonzero vector. The plane determined by the point {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the vector {{mvar|'''n'''}} consists of those points {{math|''P''}}, with position vector {{mvar|'''r'''}}, such that the vector drawn from {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''P''}} is perpendicular to {{mvar|'''n'''}}. Recalling that two vectors are perpendicular if and only if their dot product is zero, it follows that the desired plane can be described as the set of all points {{mvar|'''r'''}} such that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_0)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
(The dot here means a [[dot product|dot (scalar) product]].)
Expanded this becomes
:&lt;math&gt; a (x-x_0)+ b(y-y_0)+ c(z-z_0)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
which is the ''point-normal'' form of the equation of a plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anton|1994|loc=p. 155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is just a [[linear equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; ax + by + cz + d = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; d = -(ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0).&lt;/math&gt;
Conversely, it is easily shown that if {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} and {{math|''d''}} are constants and {{math|''a'', ''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} are not all zero, then the graph of the equation
::&lt;math&gt; ax + by + cz + d = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
is a plane having the vector {{math|1='''''n''''' = (''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}} as a normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anton|1994|loc=p. 156}}&lt;/ref&gt; This familiar equation for a plane is called the ''general form'' of the equation of the plane.&lt;ref name=Weisstein2009&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus for example a [[regression equation]] of the form {{math|1=''y'' = ''d'' + ''ax'' + ''cz''}} (with {{math|1=''b'' = −1}}) establishes a best-fit plane in three-dimensional space when there are two explanatory variables.

===Describing a plane with a point and two vectors lying on it===
Alternatively, a plane may be described parametrically as the set of all points of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = \mathbf {r}_0 + s \mathbf{v} + t \mathbf{w},&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:PlaneR.jpg|thumb|Vector description of a plane]]
where ''s'' and ''t'' range over all real numbers, '''{{math|v}}''' and {{math|'''w'''}} are given [[linear independence|linearly independent]] [[vector (geometry)|vectors]] defining the plane, and {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the vector representing the position of an arbitrary (but fixed) point on the plane. The vectors '''{{math|v}}''' and {{math|'''w'''}} can be visualized as vectors starting at {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and pointing in different directions along the plane. Note that '''{{math|v}}''' and {{math|'''w'''}} can be [[perpendicular]], but cannot be parallel.

===Describing a plane through three points===
Let {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}}(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}}(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}}(x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, z&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be non-collinear points.

====Method 1====
The plane passing through {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be described as the set of all points (x,y,z) that satisfy the following [[determinant]] equations:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
x - x_1 &amp; y - y_1 &amp; z - z_1 \\
x_2 - x_1 &amp; y_2 - y_1&amp; z_2 - z_1 \\
x_3 - x_1 &amp; y_3 - y_1 &amp; z_3 - z_1
\end{vmatrix} =\begin{vmatrix}
x - x_1 &amp; y - y_1 &amp; z - z_1 \\
x - x_2 &amp; y - y_2 &amp; z - z_2 \\
x - x_3 &amp; y - y_3 &amp; z - z_3
\end{vmatrix} = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

====Method 2====
To describe the plane by an equation of the form &lt;math&gt; ax + by + cz + d = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, solve the following system of equations:
:&lt;math&gt;\, ax_1 + by_1 + cz_1 + d = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\, ax_2 + by_2 + cz_2 + d = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\, ax_3 + by_3 + cz_3 + d = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This system can be solved using [[Cramer's rule]] and basic matrix manipulations. Let
: &lt;math&gt;D = \begin{vmatrix}
x_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; z_1 \\
x_2 &amp; y_2 &amp; z_2 \\
x_3 &amp; y_3 &amp; z_3
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

If ''D'' is non-zero (so for planes not through the origin) the values for ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' can be calculated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{-d}{D} \begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; y_1 &amp; z_1 \\
1 &amp; y_2 &amp; z_2 \\
1 &amp; y_3 &amp; z_3
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{-d}{D} \begin{vmatrix}
x_1 &amp; 1 &amp; z_1 \\
x_2 &amp; 1 &amp; z_2 \\
x_3 &amp; 1 &amp; z_3
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c = \frac{-d}{D} \begin{vmatrix}
x_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; 1 \\
x_2 &amp; y_2 &amp; 1 \\
x_3 &amp; y_3 &amp; 1
\end{vmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

These equations are parametric in ''d''. Setting ''d'' equal to any non-zero number and substituting it into these equations will yield one solution set.

====Method 3====
This plane can also be described by the "[[plane_(geometry)#Point-normal_form_and_general_form_of_the_equation_of_a_plane|point and a normal vector]]" prescription above. A suitable normal vector is given by the [[cross product]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf n = ( \mathbf p_2 - \mathbf p_1 ) \times ( \mathbf p_3 - \mathbf p_1 ), &lt;/math&gt;
and the point {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be taken to be any of the given points {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}},{{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;ref name=PaulsPlanes&gt;{{citation
|last= Dawkins
|first= Paul
|title= Calculus III
|chapter= Equations of Planes
|chapterurl= http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/EqnsOfPlanes.aspx
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or any other point in the plane).

===Distance from a point to a plane===
{{Main|Distance from a point to a plane}}
For a plane &lt;math&gt;\Pi : ax + by + cz + d = 0&lt;/math&gt; and a point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_1 = (x_1,y_1,z_1) &lt;/math&gt; not necessarily lying on the plane, the shortest distance from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_1&lt;/math&gt; to the plane is
:&lt;math&gt; D = \frac{\left | a x_1 + b y_1 + c z_1+d \right |}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

It follows that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_1&lt;/math&gt; lies in the plane [[if and only if]] ''D=0''.

If &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}=1&lt;/math&gt; meaning that ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are normalized&lt;ref&gt;To normalize arbitrary coefficients, divide each of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}&lt;/math&gt; (which can not be 0). The "new" coefficients are now normalized and the following formula is valid for the "new" coefficients.&lt;/ref&gt; then the equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt; D = \ | a x_1 + b y_1 + c z_1+d |.&lt;/math&gt;

Another vector form for the equation of a plane, known as the [[Hesse normal form]] relies on the parameter ''D''. This form is:&lt;ref name=Weisstein2009/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{r} - D_0 = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit normal vector to the plane, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; a position vector of a point of the plane and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the distance of the plane from the origin.

The general formula for higher dimensions can be quickly arrived at using [[vector notation]]. Let the [[hyperplane]] have equation &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, where the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[normal vector]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_0 = (x_{10},x_{20},\dots,x_{N0})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[position vector]] to a point in the [[hyperplane]]. We desire the perpendicular distance to the point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1 = (x_{11},x_{21},\dots,x_{N1})&lt;/math&gt;. The [[hyperplane]] may also be represented by the scalar equation &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^N a_i x_i = -a_0&lt;/math&gt;, for constants &lt;math&gt;\{a_i\}&lt;/math&gt;. Likewise, a corresponding &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; may be represented as &lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2, \dots, a_N)&lt;/math&gt;. We desire the [[scalar projection]] of the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_0&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Noting that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{r}_0 = \mathbf{r}_0 \cdot \mathbf{n} = -a_0&lt;/math&gt; (as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_0&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the equation of the [[hyperplane]]) we have
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
D &amp;= \frac{|(\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_0) \cdot \mathbf{n}|}{|\mathbf{n}|} \\
&amp;= \frac{|\mathbf{r}_1\cdot \mathbf{n} - \mathbf{r}_0 \cdot \mathbf{n}|}{|\mathbf{n}|} \\
&amp;= \frac{|\mathbf{r}_1\cdot \mathbf{n} + a_0|}{|\mathbf{n}|} \\
&amp;= \frac{|a_1x_{11} + a_2x_{21} + \dots + a_Nx_{N1} + a_0|}{\sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_N^2}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.

===Line of intersection between two planes===
The line of intersection between two planes &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1 : \mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf r = h_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi_2 : \mathbf {n}_2 \cdot \mathbf r = h_2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {n}_i&lt;/math&gt; are normalized is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {r} = (c_1 \mathbf {n}_1 + c_2 \mathbf {n}_2) + \lambda (\mathbf {n}_1 \times \mathbf {n}_2) &lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt; c_1 = \frac{ h_1 - h_2(\mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf {n}_2) }{ 1 - (\mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf {n}_2)^2 } &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; c_2 = \frac{ h_2 - h_1(\mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf {n}_2) }{ 1 - (\mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf {n}_2)^2 }.&lt;/math&gt;

This is found by noticing that the line must be perpendicular to both plane normals, and so parallel to their cross product &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {n}_1 \times \mathbf {n}_2&lt;/math&gt; (this cross product is zero if and only if the planes are parallel, and are therefore non-intersecting or entirely coincident).

The remainder of the expression is arrived at by finding an arbitrary point on the line. To do so, consider that any point in space may be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = c_1\mathbf {n}_1 + c_2\mathbf {n}_2 + \lambda(\mathbf {n}_1 \times \mathbf {n}_2)&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathbf {n}_1, \mathbf {n}_2, (\mathbf {n}_1 \times \mathbf {n}_2) \}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. We wish to find a point which is on both planes (i.e. on their intersection), so insert this equation into each of the equations of the planes to get two simultaneous equations which can be solved for &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;.

If we further assume that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {n}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {n}_2&lt;/math&gt; are [[orthonormal]] then the closest point on the line of intersection to the origin is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r_0 = h_1\mathbf {n}_1 + h_2\mathbf {n}_2&lt;/math&gt;. If that is not the case, then a more complex procedure must be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Plane-PlaneIntersection.html Plane-Plane Intersection - from Wolfram MathWorld].

===Dihedral angle===
{{See also|Dihedral angle}}
Given two intersecting planes described by &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1 : a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z + d_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi_2 : a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z + d_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the [[dihedral angle]] between them is defined to be the angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; between their normal directions:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\alpha = \frac{\hat n_1\cdot \hat n_2}{|\hat n_1||\hat n_2|} = \frac{a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2 + c_1 c_2}{\sqrt{a_1^2+b_1^2+c_1^2}\sqrt{a_2^2+b_2^2+c_2^2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Planes in various areas of mathematics==
In addition to its familiar [[geometric]] structure, with [[isomorphism]]s that are [[isometry|isometries]] with respect to the usual inner product, the plane may be viewed at various other levels of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]]. Each level of abstraction corresponds to a specific [[category (mathematics)|category]].

At one extreme, all geometrical and [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] concepts may be dropped to leave the [[topological]] plane, which may be thought of as an idealized [[homotopy|homotopically]] trivial infinite rubber sheet, which retains a notion of proximity, but has no distances. The topological plane has a concept of a linear path, but no concept of a straight line. The topological plane, or its equivalent the open disc, is the basic topological neighborhood used to construct [[surface (topology)|surface]]s (or 2-manifolds) classified in [[low-dimensional topology]]. Isomorphisms of the topological plane are all [[continuous function|continuous]] [[bijection]]s. The topological plane is the natural context for the branch of [[graph theory]] that deals with [[planar graphs]], and results such as the [[four color theorem]].

The plane may also be viewed as an [[affine space]], whose isomorphisms are combinations of translations and non-singular linear maps. From this viewpoint there are no distances, but [[collinearity]] and ratios of distances on any line are preserved.

[[Differential geometry]] views a plane as a 2-dimensional real [[manifold]], a topological plane which is provided with a [[differential structure]]. Again in this case, there is no notion of distance, but there is now a concept of smoothness of maps, for example a [[differentiable function|differentiable]] or [[smooth function|smooth]] path (depending on the type of differential structure applied). The isomorphisms in this case are bijections with the chosen degree of differentiability.

In the opposite direction of abstraction, we may apply a compatible field structure to the geometric plane, giving rise to the [[complex plane]] and the major area of [[complex analysis]]. The complex field has only two isomorphisms that leave the real line fixed, the identity and [[complex conjugation|conjugation]].

In the same way as in the real case, the plane may also be viewed as the simplest, one-dimensional (over the complex numbers) [[complex manifold]], sometimes called the complex line. However, this viewpoint contrasts sharply with the case of the plane as a 2-dimensional real manifold. The isomorphisms are all [[conformal map|conformal]] bijections of the complex plane, but the only possibilities are maps that correspond to the composition of a multiplication by a complex number and a translation.

In addition, the Euclidean geometry (which has zero [[curvature]] everywhere) is not the only geometry that the plane may have. The plane may be given a [[spherical geometry]] by using the [[stereographic projection]]. This can be thought of as placing a sphere on the plane (just like a ball on the floor), removing the top point, and projecting the sphere onto the plane from this point). This is one of the projections that may be used in making a flat map of part of the Earth's surface. The resulting geometry has constant positive curvature.

Alternatively, the plane can also be given a metric which gives it constant negative curvature giving the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]]. The latter possibility finds an application in the theory of [[special relativity]] in the simplified case where there are two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. (The hyperbolic plane is a [[timelike]] [[hypersurface]] in three-dimensional [[Minkowski space]].)

==Topological and differential geometric notions==
The [[one-point compactification]] of the plane is homeomorphic to a [[sphere]] (see [[stereographic projection]]); the open disk is homeomorphic to a sphere with the "north pole" missing; adding that point completes the (compact) sphere. The result of this compactification is a [[manifold]] referred to as the [[Riemann sphere]] or the [[complex numbers|complex]] [[projective line]]. The projection from the Euclidean plane to a sphere without a point is a [[diffeomorphism]] and even a [[conformal map]].

The plane itself is homeomorphic (and diffeomorphic) to an open [[disk (mathematics)|disk]]. For the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] such diffeomorphism is conformal, but for the Euclidean plane it is not.

'''PottersWheel''' is a [[MATLAB]] toolbox for mathematical modeling of time-dependent [[dynamical system]]s that can be expressed as [[chemical reaction network]]s or [[ordinary differential equations]] (ODEs).&lt;ref&gt;T. Maiwald and J. Timmer (2008) "Dynamical Modeling and Multi-Experiment Fitting with PottersWheel", ''Bioinformatics'' 24(18):2037–2043&lt;/ref&gt; It allows the automatic calibration of model parameters by fitting the model to experimental measurements. CPU-intensive functions are written or – in case of model dependent functions – dynamically generated in C. Modeling can be done interactively using graphical user interfaces or based on MATLAB scripts using the PottersWheel function library. The software is intended to support the work of a mathematical modeler as a real [[potter's wheel]] eases the modeling of pottery.

== Seven modeling phases ==

The basic use of PottersWheel covers seven phases from model creation to the prediction of new
experiments.

=== Model creation ===

[[File:Formalization-of-Jak-Stat-Pathway.png]]

The dynamical system is formalized into a set of reactions or differential equations using a visual model designer or a text editor. The model is stored as a MATLAB *.m ASCII file. Modifications can therefore be tracked using a version control system like [[subversion]] or [[Git (software)|git]]. Model import and export is supported for [[SBML]]. Custom import-templates may be used to import custom model structures. [[Rule-based modeling]] is also supported, where a pattern represents a set of automatically generated reactions.

Example for a simple model definition file for a reaction network A → B → C → A with observed species A and C:

&lt;source lang=matlab&gt;
function m = getModel();

% Starting with an empty model
m = pwGetEmtptyModel();

% Adding reactions
m = pwAddR(m, 'A', 'B');
m = pwAddR(m, 'B', 'C');
m = pwAddR(m, 'C', 'A');

% Adding observables
m = pwAddY(m, 'A');
m = pwAddY(m, 'C');
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Data import ===

External data saved in *.xls or *.txt files can be added to a model creating a ''model-data-couple''. A mapping dialog allows to connect data column names to observed species names. Meta information in the data files comprise information about the experimental setting. Measurement errors are either stored in the data files, will be calculated using an error model, or are estimated automatically.

=== Parameter calibration ===

To fit a model to one or more data sets, the corresponding model-data-couples are combined into a ''fitting-assembly''. Parameters like initial values, rate constants, and scaling factors can be fitted in an experiment-wise or global fashion. The user may select from several numerical integrators, optimization algorithms, and calibration strategies like fitting in normal or logarithmic parameter space.

=== Interpretation of the goodness-of-fit ===

[[File:Fitting-data-with-PottersWheel.png]]

The quality of a fit is characterized by its ''chi-squared'' value.  As a rule of thumb, for
''N'' fitted data points and ''p'' calibrated parameters, the chi-squared value should have a similar value
as ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'' or at least&amp;nbsp;''N''. Statistically, this is expressed using a [[chi-squared test]] resulting in a [[p-value]] above a significance threshold of e.g.&amp;nbsp;0.05. For lower p-values, the model is

* either not able to explain the data and has to be refined,
* the standard deviation of the data points is actually larger than specified,
* or the used fitting strategy was not successful and the fit was trapped in a local minimum.

Apart from further chi-squared based characteristics like [[Akaike information criterion|AIC]] and [[Bayesian information criterion|BIC]], data-model-residual analyses exist, e.g. to investigate whether the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] follow a [[Gaussian distribution]]. Finally, parameter [[confidence intervals]] may be estimated using either the [[Fisher information matrix]] approximation or based on the [[profile-likelihood function]], if parameters are not unambiguously identifiable.

If the fit is not acceptable, the model has to be refined and the procedure continues with step 2. Else, the dynamic model properties can be examined and predictions calculated.

=== Model refinement ===

If the model structure is not able to explain the experimental measurements, a set of physiologically reasonable alternative models should be created. In order to avoid redundant model paragraphs and copy-and-paste errors, this can be done using a common core-model which is the same for all variants.  Then, ''daughter''-models are created and fitted to the data, preferably using batch processing strategies based on MATLAB scripts. As a starting point to envision suitable model variants, the PottersWheel ''equalizer'' may be used to understand the dynamic behavior of the original system.

=== Model analysis and prediction ===

A mathematical model may serve to display the concentration time-profile of unobserved species, to determine sensitive parameters representing potential targets within a clinical setting, or to calculate model characteristics like the half-life of a species.

Each analysis step may be stored into a modeling report, which may be exported as a Latex-based PDF.

=== Experimental design ===

An experimental setting corresponds to specific characteristics of ''driving input functions'' and
initial concentrations. In a signal transduction pathway model the concentration of a ligand
like EGF may be controlled experimentally.  The driving input designer allows investigating the effect of a continuous, ramp, or pulse stimulation in combination with varying initial concentrations using the equalizer.  In order to discriminate competing model hypotheses, the designed experiment should have as different observable time-profiles as possible.

== Parameter identifiability ==

Many dynamical systems can only be observed partially, i.e. not all system species are accessible experimentally. For biological applications the amount and quality of experimental data is often limited. In this setting parameters can be structurally or practically non-identifiable. Then, parameters may compensate each other and fitted parameter values strongly depend on initial guesses. In PottersWheel non-identifiability can be detected using the [[Profile Likelihood Approach]].&lt;ref&gt;''Structural and practical identifiability analysis of partially observed dynamical models by exploiting the profile likelihood'', A. Raue, C. Kreutz, T. Maiwald, J. Bachmann, M. Schilling, U. Klingmüller and J. Timmer, Bioinformatics 2009
&lt;/ref&gt; For characterizing functional relationships between the non-identifiable parameters PottersWheel applies random and systematic fit sequences.&lt;ref&gt;''Data-based identifiability analysis of non-linear dynamical models'', S. Hengl, C. Kreutz, J. Timmer and T. Maiwald, Bioinformatics 2007 23(19):2612–2618&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[computer science]] and [[operations research]],
many [[combinatorial optimization]] problems are computationally [[intractability (complexity)|intractable]] to solve exactly (to optimality).
Many such problems do admit fast ([[polynomial time]]) [[approximation algorithms]]—that is, algorithms that are guaranteed to return an approximately optimal solution given any input.

'''Randomized rounding'''
{{harv|Raghavan|Tompson|1987}}
is a widely used approach for designing and analyzing such [[approximation algorithms]].&lt;ref name="MotwaniRaghavan1995"&gt;

The basic idea is to use the [[probabilistic method]]
to convert an optimal solution of a [[linear programming relaxation|relaxation]]
of the problem into an approximately optimal solution to the original problem.

== Overview ==
The basic approach has three steps:
# Formulate the problem to be solved as an [[integer linear program]] (ILP).
# Compute an optimal fractional solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the [[linear programming relaxation]] (LP) of the ILP.
# Round the fractional solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the LP to an integer solution &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; of the ILP.

(Although the approach is most commonly applied with linear programs,
other kinds of relaxations are sometimes used.
For example, see Goeman's and Williamson's [[semi-definite programming]]-based
[[Semi-definite_programming#Example_3_.28Goemans-Williamson_MAX_CUT_approximation_algorithm.29|Max-Cut approximation algorithm]].)

The challenge in the first step is to choose a suitable integer linear program.
Familiarity with linear programming is required, in particular, familiarity with
how to model problems using linear programs and integer linear programs.
But, for many problems, there is a natural integer linear program that works well,
such as in the Set Cover example below.  (The integer linear program should have a small
[[Linear_programming_relaxation#Approximation_and_integrality_gap|integrality gap]];
indeed randomized rounding is often used to prove bounds on integrality gaps.)

In the second step, the optimal fractional solution can typically  be computed
in [[Polynomial_time#Polynomial_time|polynomial time]]
using any standard [[linear programming]] algorithm.

In the third step, the fractional solution must be converted into an integer solution
(and thus a solution to the original problem).
This is called ''rounding'' the fractional solution.
The resulting integer solution should (provably) have cost
not much larger than the cost of the fractional solution.
This will ensure that the cost of the integer solution
is not much larger than the cost of the optimal integer solution.

The main technique used to do the third step (rounding) is to use randomization,
and then to use probabilistic arguments to bound the increase in cost due to the rounding
(following the [[probabilistic method]] from combinatorics).
There, probabilistic arguments are used to show the existence of discrete structures with
desired properties.  In this context, one uses such arguments to show the following:
: ''Given any fractional solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the LP, with positive probability the randomized rounding process produces an integer solution &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; that approximates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;'' according to some desired criterion.

Finally, to make the third step computationally efficient,
one either shows that &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; approximates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
with high probability (so that the step can remain randomized)
or one [[Derandomization|derandomizes]] the rounding step,
typically using the [[method of conditional probabilities]].
The latter method converts the randomized rounding process
into an efficient deterministic process that is guaranteed
to reach a good outcome.

== Comparison to other applications of the probabilistic method ==
The randomized rounding step differs from most applications of the [[probabilistic method]] in two respects:
# The [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] of the rounding step is important.  It should be implementable by a fast (e.g. [[polynomial time]]) [[algorithm]].
# The probability distribution underlying the random experiment is a function of the solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of a [[linear programming relaxation|relaxation]] of the problem instance.  This fact is crucial to proving the [[Approximation_algorithm#Performance_guarantees|performance guarantee]] of the approximation algorithm --- that is, that for any problem instance, the algorithm returns a solution that approximates the ''optimal solution for that specific instance''.  In comparison, [[Probabilistic method|applications of the probabilistic method in combinatorics]] typically show the existence of structures whose features depend on other parameters of the input.  For example, consider [[Turán's theorem]], which can be stated as "any [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices of average degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; must have an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] of size at least &lt;math&gt;n/(d+1)&lt;/math&gt;.   (See  [[Method_of_conditional_probabilities#Turán.27s_theorem|this for a probabilistic proof of Turán's theorem]].) While there are graphs for which this bound is tight, there are also graphs which have independent sets much larger than &lt;math&gt;n/(d+1)&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the size of the independent set shown to exist by Turán's theorem in a graph may, in general, be much smaller than the maximum independent set for that graph.

== Set cover example ==
The following example illustrates how randomized rounding can be used to design an approximation algorithm for the [[Set Cover]] problem.

Fix any instance &lt;math&gt;\langle c, \mathcal S\rangle&lt;/math&gt; of set cover over a universe &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt;.

For step 1, let IP be the [[set cover#Integer linear program formulation|standard integer linear program for set cover]] for this instance.

For step 2, let LP be the [[linear programming relaxation]] of IP,
and compute an optimal solution &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; to LP
using any standard [[linear programming]] algorithm.
(This takes time polynomial in the input size.)

(The feasible solutions to LP are the vectors &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
that assign each set &lt;math&gt;s \in\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt;
a non-negative weight &lt;math&gt;x_s&lt;/math&gt;,
such that, for each element &lt;math&gt;e\in\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; ''covers'' &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;
-- the total weight assigned to the sets containing &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;
is at least 1, that is,
:: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{s\ni e} x_s \ge 1.&lt;/math&gt;
The optimal solution &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;
is a feasible solution whose cost
::  &lt;math&gt;\sum_{s\in\mathcal S} c(S)x^*_s&lt;/math&gt;
is as small as possible.)

----
Note that any set cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt;
gives a feasible solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
(where &lt;math&gt;x_s=1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;s\in\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;x_s=0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise).
The cost of this &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; equals the cost of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, that is,
::  &lt;math&gt;\sum_{s\in\mathcal C} c(s) = \sum_{s\in\mathcal S} c(s) x_s.&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, the linear program LP is a [[linear programming relaxation|relaxation]]
of the given set-cover problem.

Since &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; has minimum cost among feasible solutions to the LP,
''the cost of &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; is a lower bound on the cost of the optimal set cover''.

=== Step 3: The randomized rounding step ===
Here is a description of the third step—the rounding step,
which must convert the minimum-cost fractional set cover &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;
into a feasible integer solution &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; (corresponding to a true set cover).

The rounding step should produce an &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; that, with positive probability,
has cost  within a small factor of the cost of &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;.
Then (since the cost of &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; is a lower bound on the cost of the optimal set cover),
the cost of &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; will be within a small factor of the optimal cost.

As a starting point, consider the most natural rounding scheme:
:: ''For each set &lt;math&gt;s\in\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; in turn, take &lt;math&gt;x'_s = 1&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\min(1,x^*_s)&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise take &lt;math&gt;x'_s = 0&lt;/math&gt;.''

With this rounding scheme,
the expected cost of the chosen sets is at most &lt;math&gt;\sum_s c(s) x^*_s&lt;/math&gt;,
the cost of the fractional cover.
This is good.  Unfortunately the coverage is not good.
When the variables &lt;math&gt;x^*_s&lt;/math&gt; are small,
the probability that an element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is not covered is about

:  &lt;math&gt;
\prod_{s\ni e} 1-x^*_s
\approx
\prod_{s\ni e} \exp(-x^*_s)
=
\exp\Big(-\sum_{s\ni e}x^*_s\Big)
\approx \exp(-1).
&lt;/math&gt;

So only a constant fraction of the elements will be covered in expectation.

To make &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; cover every element with high probability,
the standard rounding scheme
first ''scales up'' the rounding probabilities
by an appropriate factor &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;.
Here is the standard rounding scheme:
::  ''Fix a parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;.  For each set &lt;math&gt;s\in\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; in turn,''
::  ''take &lt;math&gt;x'_s = 1&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\min(\lambda x^*_s, 1)&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise take &lt;math&gt;x'_s = 0&lt;/math&gt;.''

Scaling the probabilities up by &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
increases the expected cost by &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;,
but makes coverage of all elements likely.
The idea is to choose &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; as small
as possible so that all elements are provably
covered with non-zero probability.
Here is a detailed analysis.

----

==== Lemma (approximation guarantee for rounding scheme) ====
:: ''Fix &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \ln (2|\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt;.  With positive probability, the rounding scheme returns a set cover &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; of cost at most &lt;math&gt;2\ln(2|\mathcal U|) c\cdot x^*&lt;/math&gt; (and thus of cost &lt;math&gt;O(\log |\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt; times the cost of the optimal set cover).''

(Note: with care the  &lt;math&gt;O(\log |\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt;
can be reduced to &lt;math&gt;\ln(|\mathcal U|)+O(\log\log|\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt;.)

==== Proof ====
The output &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; of the random rounding scheme has the desired properties
as long as none of the following "bad" events occur:
# the cost &lt;math&gt;c\cdot x'&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; exceeds &lt;math&gt;2\lambda c\cdot x^*&lt;/math&gt;, or
# for some element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; fails to cover &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;.

The expectation of each  &lt;math&gt;x'_s&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt;\lambda x_s^*&lt;/math&gt;.
By [[Expected_value#Linearity|linearity of expectation]],
the expectation of  &lt;math&gt;c\cdot x'&lt;/math&gt;
is at most &lt;math&gt;\sum_s c(s)\lambda x_s^*=\lambda c\cdot x^*&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, by [[Markov's inequality]], the probability of the first bad event
above is at most &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;.

For the remaining bad events (one for each element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;), note that,
since &lt;math&gt;\sum_{s\ni e} x^*_s \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; for any given element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;,
the probability that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is not covered is

:  &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\prod_{s\ni e} \big(1-\min(\lambda x^*_s,1) \big)
&amp; &lt; \prod_{s\ni e} \exp({-}\lambda x^*_s)
= \exp\Big({-}\lambda \sum_{s\ni e} x^*_s \Big)
\\ 
&amp; \le \exp({-}\lambda)
= 1/(2|\mathcal U|).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

(This uses the inequality &lt;math&gt;1+z\le e^z&lt;/math&gt;,
which is strict for &lt;math&gt;z \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;.)

Thus, for each of the &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal U|&lt;/math&gt; elements,
the probability that the element is not covered is less than &lt;math&gt;1/(2\mathcal U)&lt;/math&gt;.

By the [[naive union bound]],
the probability that one of the &lt;math&gt;1+|\mathcal U|&lt;/math&gt; bad events happens
is less than &lt;math&gt;1/2 + |\mathcal U|/(2\mathcal U)=1&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, with positive probability there are no bad events
and &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; is a set cover of cost at most &lt;math&gt;2\lambda c\cdot x^*&lt;/math&gt;.
QED

=== Derandomization using the method of conditional probabilities ===
&lt;!-- Note: this subsection is linked to from [[method_of_conditional_probabilities]].  
     If you change the title here, please update that link --&gt;

The lemma above shows the ''existence'' of a set cover
of cost &lt;math&gt;O(\log(|\mathcal U|)c\cdot x^*&lt;/math&gt;).
In this context our goal is an efficient approximation algorithm,
not just an existence proof, so we are not done.

One approach would be to increase &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
a little bit, then show that the probability of success is at least, say, 1/4.
With this modification, repeating the random rounding step a few times
is enough to ensure a successful outcome with high probability.

That approach weakens the approximation ratio.
We next describe a different approach that yields
a deterministic algorithm that is guaranteed to
match the approximation ratio of the existence proof above.
The approach is called the [[method of conditional probabilities]].

The deterministic algorithm emulates the randomized rounding scheme:
it considers each set &lt;math&gt;s\in\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; in turn,
and chooses &lt;math&gt;x'_s \in\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
But instead of making each choice ''randomly'' based on &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;,
it makes the choice ''deterministically'', so as to
''keep the conditional probability of failure, given the choices so far, below 1''.

==== Bounding the conditional probability of failure ====
We want to be able to set each variable &lt;math&gt;x'_s&lt;/math&gt; in turn
so as to keep the conditional probability of failure below 1.
To do this, we need a good bound on the conditional probability of failure.
The bound will come by refining the original existence proof.
That proof implicitly bounds the probability of failure
by the expectation of the random variable
:  &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{c\cdot x'}{2\lambda c\cdot x^*} + |\mathcal U^{(m)}|&lt;/math&gt;, 
where
:  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U^{(m)}= \Big\{ e  : \prod_{s\ni e} (1-x'_s) = 1\Big\}&lt;/math&gt;
is the set of elements left uncovered at the end.

The random variable &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; may appear a bit mysterious,
but it mirrors the probabilistic proof in a systematic way.
The first term in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; comes from applying [[Markov's inequality]]
to bound the probability of the first bad event (the cost is too high).
It contributes at least 1 to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; if the cost of &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; is too high.
The second term
counts the number of bad events of the second kind (uncovered elements).
It contributes at least 1 to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; leaves any element uncovered.
Thus, in any outcome where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is less than 1,
&lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; must cover all the elements
and have cost meeting the desired bound from the lemma.
In short, if the rounding step fails, then &lt;math&gt;F \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;.
This implies (by [[Markov's inequality]]) that
''&lt;math&gt;E[F]&lt;/math&gt; is an upper bound on the probability of failure.''
Note that the argument above is implicit already in the proof of the lemma,
which also shows by calculation that &lt;math&gt;E[F] &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

To apply the method of conditional probabilities,
we need to extend the argument to bound the ''conditional'' probability of failure
as the rounding step proceeds.
Usually, this can be done in a systematic way,
although it can be technically tedious.

So, what about the ''conditional'' probability of failure as the rounding step iterates through the sets?
Since &lt;math&gt;F \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; in any outcome where the rounding step fails,
by [[Markov's inequality]], the ''conditional'' probability of failure
is at most the ''conditional'' expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

Next we calculate the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;,
much as we calculated the unconditioned expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; in the original proof.
Consider the state of the rounding process at the end of some iteration &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;S^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt; denote the sets considered so far
(the first &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; sets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt;).
Let &lt;math&gt;x^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt; denote the (partially assigned) vector &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;
(so &lt;math&gt;x^{(t)}_s&lt;/math&gt; is determined only if &lt;math&gt;s\in S^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt;).
For each set &lt;math&gt;s\not\in S^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt;,
let &lt;math&gt;p_s = \min(\lambda x^*_s, 1)&lt;/math&gt;
denote the probability with which &lt;math&gt;x'_s&lt;/math&gt; will be set to 1.
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt; contain the not-yet-covered elements.
Then the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;,
given the choices made so far, that is, given &lt;math&gt;x^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, is

: &lt;math&gt;
E[F | x^{(t)}]
~=~
\frac{\sum_{s\in S^{(t)}} c(s) x'_s 
+ \sum_{s\not\in S^{(t)}} c(s) p_s}{2\lambda c\cdot x^*}
~+~
\sum_{e\in \mathcal U^{(t)}}\prod_{s\not\in S^{(t)}, s\ni e} (1-p_s).
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;E[F | x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt; is determined only after iteration &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Keeping the conditional probability of failure below 1 ====
To keep the conditional probability of failure below 1,
it suffices to keep the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; below 1.
To do this, it suffices to keep the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; from increasing.
This is what the algorithm will do.
It will set &lt;math&gt;x'_s&lt;/math&gt; in each iteration to ensure that
:: &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(m)}] \le E[F|x^{(m-1)}] \le \cdots \le E[F|x^{(1)}] \le E[F|x^{(0)}] &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;
(where &lt;math&gt;m=|\mathcal S|&lt;/math&gt;).

In the &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;th iteration,
how can the algorithm set &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;
to ensure that &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(t)}] \le E[F|S^{(t-1)}]&lt;/math&gt;?
It turns out that it can simply set &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;
so as to ''minimize'' the resulting value of &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt;.

To see why, focus on the point in time when iteration &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; starts.
At that time, &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(t-1)}]&lt;/math&gt; is determined,
but &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt; is not yet determined
--- it can take two possible values depending on how &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;
is set in iteration &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;E^{(t-1)}&lt;/math&gt; denote the value of &lt;math&gt;E[F|x'^{(t-1)}]&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;E^{(t)}_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^{(t)}_1&lt;/math&gt;,
denote the two possible values of  &lt;math&gt;E[F|x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt;,
depending on whether &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt; is set to 0, or 1, respectively.
By the definition of conditional expectation,
:: &lt;math&gt;
E^{(t-1)} ~=~ 
\Pr[x'_{s'}=0] E^{(t)}_0
+
\Pr[x'_{s'}=1] E^{(t)}_1.
&lt;/math&gt;
Since a weighted average of two quantities
is always at least the minimum of those two quantities,
it follows that
:: &lt;math&gt;
E^{(t-1)} ~\ge~ \min( E^{(t)}_0, E^{(t)}_1 ).
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, setting &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;
so as to minimize the resulting value of
&lt;math&gt;E[F | x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt;
will guarantee that
&lt;math&gt;E[F | x^{(t)}] \le E[F | x^{(t-1)}]&lt;/math&gt;.
This is what the algorithm will do.

In detail, what does this mean?
Considered as a function of &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;
(with all other quantities fixed)
&lt;math&gt;E[F | x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt;
is a linear function of &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt;,
and the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt; in that function is
:   &lt;math&gt;\frac{c_{s'}}{2\lambda c\cdot x^*}
~-~
\sum_{e\in s'\cap \mathcal U_{t-1}}\prod_{s\not\in S^{(t)}, s\ni e} (1-p_s).
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the algorithm should set &lt;math&gt;x'_{s'}&lt;/math&gt; to 0 if this expression is positive,
and 1 otherwise.  This gives the following algorithm.

=== Randomized-rounding algorithm for set cover ===

# Let &lt;math&gt;\lambda \leftarrow \ln(2|\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;p_s \leftarrow \min(\lambda x^*_{s},1)&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;s\in\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt;.
# For each &lt;math&gt;s'\in\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; do:
## Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S \leftarrow \mathcal S - \{s'\}&lt;/math&gt;.  &amp;nbsp; (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal S&lt;/math&gt; contains the not-yet-decided sets.)

&lt;/math&gt;

##:  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt; contains the not-yet-covered elements.)
# Return &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;.

==== lemma (approximation guarantee for algorithm) ====

:: ''The algorithm above returns a set cover &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; of cost at most &lt;math&gt;2\ln(2|\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt; times the minimum cost of any (fractional) set cover.''

==== proof ====
----
The algorithm ensures that the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;E[F \,|\, x^{(t)}]&lt;/math&gt;, does not increase at each iteration.
Since this conditional expectation is initially less than 1 (as shown previously),
the algorithm ensures that the conditional expectation stays below 1.
Since the conditional probability of failure
is at most the conditional expectation of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;,
in this way the algorithm
ensures that the conditional probability of failure stays below 1.
Thus, at the end, when all choices are determined,
the algorithm reaches a successful outcome.
That is, the algorithm above returns a set cover &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;
of cost at most &lt;math&gt;2\ln(2|\mathcal U|)&lt;/math&gt; times
the minimum cost of any (fractional) set cover.

=== Remarks ===
In the example above, the algorithm was guided by the conditional expectation of a random variable &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.
In some cases, instead of an exact conditional expectation,
an ''upper bound'' (or sometimes a lower bound)
on some conditional expectation is used instead.
This is called a [[pessimistic estimator]].

'''Reverse mathematics''' is a program in [[mathematical logic]] that seeks to determine which axioms are required to prove theorems of mathematics.  Its defining method can briefly be described as "going backwards from the [[theorem]]s to the [[axiom]]s", in contrast to the ordinary mathematical practice of deriving theorems from axioms. It can be conceptualized as sculpting out [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary]] conditions from [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]] ones.

The reverse mathematics program was foreshadowed by results in set theory such as the classical theorem that the [[axiom of choice]] and [[Zorn's lemma]] are equivalent over [[ZF set theory]]. The goal of reverse mathematics, however, is to study possible axioms of ordinary theorems of mathematics rather than possible axioms for set theory.

Reverse mathematics is usually carried out using subsystems of [[second-order arithmetic]], where many of its definitions and methods are inspired by previous work in [[constructive analysis]] and [[proof theory]]. The use of second-order arithmetic also allows many techniques from [[recursion theory]] to be employed; many results in reverse mathematics have corresponding results in [[computable analysis]].

The program was founded by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Harvey Friedman|first=Harvey|last= Friedman|year1=1975|year2=1976}} and brought forward by [[Steve Simpson (mathematician)|Steve Simpson]].  A standard reference for the subject is {{harv|Simpson|2009}}, while an introduction for non-specialists is {{harv|Stillwell|2018}}.

== General principles ==
In reverse mathematics, one starts with a framework language and a base theory—a core axiom system—that is too weak to prove most of the theorems one might be interested in, but still powerful enough to develop the definitions necessary to state these theorems.  For example, to study the theorem “Every bounded sequence of [[real number]]s has a [[supremum]]” it is necessary to use a base system which can speak of real numbers and sequences of real numbers.

For each theorem that can be stated in the base system but is not provable in the base system, the goal is to determine the particular axiom system (stronger than the base system) that is necessary to prove that theorem. To show that a system ''S'' is required to prove a theorem ''T'', two proofs are required. The first proof shows ''T'' is provable from ''S''; this is an ordinary mathematical proof along with a justification that it can be carried out in the system ''S''. The second proof, known as a '''reversal''', shows that ''T'' itself implies ''S''; this proof is carried out in the base system. The reversal establishes that no axiom system ''S&amp;prime;'' that extends the base system can be weaker than ''S'' while still proving&amp;nbsp;''T''.

=== Use of second-order arithmetic ===

Most reverse mathematics research focuses on subsystems of [[second-order arithmetic]]. The body of research in reverse mathematics has established that weak subsystems of second-order arithmetic suffice to formalize almost all undergraduate-level mathematics. In second-order arithmetic, all objects can be represented as either [[natural number]]s or sets of natural numbers.  For example, in order to prove theorems about real numbers, the real numbers can be represented as [[Cauchy sequence]]s of [[rational number]]s, each of which can be represented as a set of natural numbers.

The axiom systems most often considered in reverse mathematics are defined using [[axiom scheme]]s called '''comprehension schemes'''.  Such a scheme states that any set of natural numbers definable by a formula of a given complexity exists. In this context, the complexity of formulas is measured using the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] and [[analytical hierarchy]].

The reason that reverse mathematics is not carried out using set theory as a base system is that the language of set theory is too expressive.  Extremely complex sets of natural numbers can be defined by simple formulas in the language of set theory (which can quantify over arbitrary sets). In the context of second-order arithmetic, results such as [[Post's theorem]] establish a close link between the complexity of a formula and the (non)computability of the set it defines.

Another effect of using second-order arithmetic is the need to restrict general mathematical theorems to forms that can be expressed within arithmetic. For example, second-order arithmetic can express the principle "Every countable [[vector space]] has a basis" but it cannot express the principle "Every vector space has a basis". In practical terms, this means that theorems of algebra and combinatorics are restricted to countable structures, while theorems of analysis and topology are restricted to [[separable space]]s. Many principles that imply the [[axiom of choice]] in their general form (such as "Every vector space has a basis") become provable in weak subsystems of second-order arithmetic when they are restricted. For example, "every field has an algebraic closure" is not provable in ZF set theory, but the restricted form "every countable field has an algebraic closure" is provable in RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the weakest system typically employed in reverse mathematics.

=== Use of higher-order arithmetic ===

A recent strand of ''higher-order'' reverse mathematics research, initiated by [[Ulrich Kohlenbach]], focuses on subsystems of [[higher-order arithmetic]] ({{harvtxt|Kohlenbach|2005}}). 
Due to the richer language of higher-order arithmetic, the use of representations (aka 'codes') common in second-order arithmetic, is greatly reduced.  
For example, a continuous function on the [[Cantor space]] is just a function that maps binary sequences to binary sequences, and that also satisfies the usual 'epsilon-delta'-definition of continuity. 

Higher-order reverse mathematics includes higher-order versions of (second-order) comprehension schemes.  Such an higher-order axiom states the existence of a functional that decides the truth or falsity of formulas of a given complexity. In this context, the complexity of formulas is also measured using the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] and [[analytical hierarchy]].  The higher-order counterparts of the major subsystems of second-order arithmetic generally prove the same second-order sentences (or a large subset) as the original second-order systems (see {{harvtxt|Kohlenbach|2005}} and {{harvtxt|Hunter|2008}}).  For instance, the base theory of higher-order reverse mathematics, called RCA&lt;sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, proves the same sentences as RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, up to language.  

As noted in the previous paragraph, second-order comprehension axioms easily generalize to the higher-order framework.  However, theorems expressing the ''[[compactness]]'' of basic spaces behave quite differently in second- and higher-order arithmetic: on one hand, when restricted to countable covers/the language of second-order arithmetic, the compactness of the unit interval is provable in WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; from the next section.  On the other hand, given uncountable covers/the language of higher-order arithmetic, the compactness of the unit interval is only provable from (full) second-order arithmetic ({{harvtxt|Normann-Sanders|2017}}).  Other covering lemmas (e.g. due to [[Lindelöf]], [[Vitali]], [[Besicovitch]], etc) exhibit the same behavior, and many basic properties of the [[gauge integral]] are equivalent to the compactness of the underlying space.

== The big five subsystems of second-order arithmetic ==

[[Second-order arithmetic]] is a formal theory of the natural numbers and sets of natural numbers.  Many mathematical objects, such as [[countable set|countable]] [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[group (mathematics)|groups]], and [[field (mathematics)|fields]], as well as points in [[effective Polish space]]s, can be represented as sets of natural numbers, and modulo this representation can be studied in second-order arithmetic.

Reverse mathematics makes use of several subsystems of second-order arithmetic. A typical reverse mathematics theorem shows that a particular mathematical theorem ''T'' is equivalent to a particular subsystem ''S'' of second-order arithmetic over a weaker subsystem ''B''. This weaker system ''B'' is known as the '''base system''' for the result; in order for the reverse mathematics result to have
meaning, this system must not itself be able to prove the mathematical theorem ''T''.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

{{harvtxt|Simpson|2009}} describes five particular subsystems of second-order arithmetic, which he calls the '''Big Five''', that occur frequently in reverse mathematics. In order of increasing strength, these systems are named by the initialisms RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ATR&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and
Π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

The subscript &lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in these names means that the induction scheme has been restricted from the full second-order induction scheme {{harv|Simpson|2009|loc=p. 6}}. For example, ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; includes the induction axiom (0&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;∀''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''))&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∀''n''&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;X. This together with the full comprehension axiom of second-order arithmetic  implies the full second-order induction scheme given by the universal closure of (φ(0) ∧ ∀n(φ(n) → φ(n+1))) → ∀n φ(n) for any second-order formula φ. However ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; does not have the full comprehension axiom, and the subscript &lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a reminder that it does not have the full second-order induction scheme either.  This restriction is important: systems with restricted induction have significantly lower proof-theoretical ordinals than systems with the full second-order induction scheme.

=== The base system RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;===

RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the fragment of second-order arithmetic whose axioms are the axioms of [[Robinson arithmetic]], induction for &amp;Sigma;{{su|p=0|b=1}} formulas, and comprehension for &amp;Delta;{{su|p=0|b=1}} formulas.

The subsystem RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the one most commonly used as a base system for reverse mathematics. The initials "RCA" stand for "recursive comprehension axiom", where "recursive" means "computable", as in [[computable function|recursive function]].  This name is used because RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds informally to "computable mathematics". In particular, any set of natural numbers that can be proven to exist in RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is computable, and thus any theorem which implies that noncomputable sets exist is not provable in RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. To this extent, RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a constructive system, although it does not meet the requirements of the program of [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]] because it is a theory in classical logic including the law of excluded middle.

Despite its seeming weakness (of not proving any noncomputable sets exist), RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is sufficient to prove a number of classical theorems which, therefore, require only minimal logical strength. These theorems are, in a sense, below the reach of the reverse mathematics enterprise because they are already provable in the base system. The classical theorems provable in RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; include:
* Basic properties of the natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers (for example, that the latter form an [[ordered field]]).
* Basic properties of the real numbers (the real numbers are an [[Archimedean property|Archimedean]] ordered field; any [[nested sequence of closed intervals]] whose lengths tend to zero has a single point in its intersection; the real numbers are not countable).
* The [[Baire category theorem]] for a [[complete metric space|complete]] [[separable space|separable]] [[metric space]] (the separability condition is necessary to even state the theorem in the language of second-order arithmetic).
* The [[intermediate value theorem]] on continuous real functions.
* The [[Banach–Steinhaus theorem]] for a sequence of continuous linear operators on separable Banach spaces.
* A weak version of [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] (for a set of sentences, in a countable language, that is already closed under consequence).
* The existence of an [[algebraic closure]] for a countable field (but not its uniqueness).
* The existence and uniqueness of the [[Real closed field|real closure]] of a countable ordered field.

The first-order part of RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the theorems of the system that do not involve any set variables) is the set of theorems of first-order Peano arithmetic with induction limited to Σ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; formulas.  It is provably consistent, as is RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, in full first-order Peano arithmetic.

=== Weak Kőnig's lemma WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;===

The subsystem WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; consists of RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; plus a weak form of [[Kőnig's lemma]], namely the statement that every infinite subtree of the full binary tree (the tree of all finite sequences of 0's and 1's) has an infinite path. This proposition, which is known as ''weak Kőnig's lemma'', is easy to state in the language of second-order arithmetic. WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can also be defined as the principle of Σ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; separation (given two Σ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; formulas of a free variable ''n'' which are exclusive, there is a class containing all ''n'' satisfying the one and no ''n'' satisfying the other).

The following remark on terminology is in order.  The term “weak Kőnig's lemma” refers to the sentence which says that any infinite subtree of the binary tree has an infinite path.  When this axiom is added to RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the resulting subsystem is called WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. A similar distinction between particular axioms, on the one hand, and subsystems including the basic axioms and induction, on the other hand, is made for the stronger subsystems described below.

In a sense, weak Kőnig's lemma is a form of the [[axiom of choice]] (although, as stated, it can be proven in classical Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice).  It is not constructively valid in some senses of the word constructive.

To show that WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is actually stronger than (not provable in) RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, it is sufficient to exhibit a theorem of WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; which implies that noncomputable sets exist. This is not difficult; WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; implies the existence of separating sets for effectively inseparable recursively enumerable sets.

It turns out that RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; have the same first-order part, meaning that they prove the same first-order sentences.  WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can prove a good number of classical mathematical results which do not follow from RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, however.  These results are not expressible as first-order statements but can be expressed as second-order statements.

The following results are equivalent to weak Kőnig's lemma and thus to WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; over RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:

* The [[Heine–Borel theorem]] for the closed unit real interval, in the following sense: every covering by a sequence of open intervals has a finite subcovering.
* The Heine–Borel theorem for complete totally bounded separable metric spaces (where covering is by a sequence of open balls).
* A continuous real function on the closed unit interval (or on any compact separable metric space, as above) is bounded (or: bounded and reaches its bounds).
* A continuous real function on the closed unit interval can be uniformly approximated by polynomials (with rational coefficients).
* A continuous real function on the closed unit interval is uniformly continuous.
* A continuous real function on the closed unit interval is [[Riemann integral|Riemann]] integrable.
* The [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]] (for continuous functions on a finite product of copies of the closed unit interval).
* The separable [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] in the form: a bounded linear form on a subspace of a separable Banach space extends to a bounded linear form on the whole space.
* The [[Jordan curve theorem]]
* Gödel's completeness theorem (for a countable language).
* Determinacy for open (or even clopen) games on {0,1} of length ω.
* Every countable [[commutative ring]] has a [[prime ideal]].
* Every countable formally real field is orderable.
* Uniqueness of algebraic closure (for a countable field).

=== Arithmetical comprehension ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;===

ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; plus the comprehension scheme for arithmetical formulas (which is sometimes called the "arithmetical comprehension axiom"). That is, ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; allows us to form the set of natural numbers satisfying an arbitrary arithmetical formula (one with no bound set variables, although possibly containing set parameters). Actually, it suffices to add to RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the comprehension scheme for Σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; formulas in order to obtain full arithmetical comprehension.

The first-order part of ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is exactly first-order Peano arithmetic; ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a ''conservative'' extension of first-order Peano arithmetic.  The two systems are provably (in a weak system) equiconsistent.  ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be thought of as a framework of [[Impredicativity|predicative]] mathematics, although there are predicatively provable theorems that are not provable in ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Most of the fundamental results about the natural numbers, and many other mathematical theorems, can be proven in this system.

One way of seeing that ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is stronger than WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is to exhibit a model of WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; that doesn't contain all arithmetical sets. In fact, it is possible to build a model of WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; consisting entirely of [[Low (computability)|low sets]] using the [[low basis theorem]], since low sets relative to low sets are low.

The following assertions are equivalent to ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
over RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:
* The sequential completeness of the real numbers (every bounded increasing sequence of real numbers has a limit).
* The [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]].
* [[Ascoli's theorem]]: every bounded equicontinuous sequence of real functions on the unit interval has a uniformly convergent subsequence.
* Every countable commutative ring has a [[maximal ideal]].
* Every countable vector space over the rationals (or over any countable field) has a basis.
* Every countable field has a [[transcendence basis]].
* Kőnig's lemma (for arbitrary finitely branching trees, as opposed to the weak version described above).
* Various theorems in combinatorics, such as certain forms of [[Ramsey's theorem]].

=== Arithmetical transfinite recursion ATR&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;===

The system ATR&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; adds to ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; an axiom which states, informally, that any arithmetical functional (meaning any arithmetical formula with a free number variable ''n'' and a free class variable ''X'', seen as the operator taking ''X'' to the set of ''n'' satisfying the formula) can be iterated transfinitely along any countable [[well ordering]] starting with any set.  ATR&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent over ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to the principle of Σ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; separation. ATR&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is impredicative, and has the proof-theoretic ordinal &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_0&lt;/math&gt;, the supremum of that of predicative systems.

ATR&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; proves the consistency of ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]] it is strictly stronger.

The following assertions are equivalent to
ATR&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; over RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:
* Any two countable well orderings are comparable. That is, they are isomorphic or one is isomorphic to a proper initial segment of the other.
* [[Ulm's theorem]] for countable reduced Abelian groups.
* The [[perfect set property|perfect set theorem]], which states that every uncountable closed subset of a complete separable metric space contains a perfect closed set.
* [[Lusin's separation theorem]] (essentially Σ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; separation).
* [[Determinacy]] for [[open set]]s in the [[Baire space]].

=== Π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; comprehension Π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;===

Π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is stronger than arithmetical transfinite recursion and is fully impredicative. It consists of RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; plus the comprehension scheme for Π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; formulas.

In a sense, Π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; comprehension is to arithmetical transfinite recursion (Σ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; separation) as ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is to weak Kőnig's lemma (Σ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; separation).   It is equivalent to several statements of descriptive set theory whose proofs make use of strongly impredicative arguments; this equivalence shows that these impredicative arguments cannot be removed.

The following theorems are equivalent to Π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  over RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:
* The [[Cantor–Bendixson theorem]] (every closed set of reals is the union of a perfect set and a countable set).
* Every countable abelian group is the direct sum of a divisible group and a reduced group.

== Additional systems ==

* Weaker systems than recursive comprehension can be defined.  The weak system RCA{{su|p=*|b=0}} consists of [[elementary function arithmetic]] EFA (the basic axioms plus Δ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; induction in the enriched language with an exponential operation) plus Δ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; comprehension. Over RCA{{su|p=*|b=0}},  recursive comprehension as defined earlier (that is, with Σ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; induction) is equivalent to the statement that a polynomial (over a countable field) has only finitely many roots and to the classification theorem for finitely generated Abelian groups. The system RCA{{su|p=*|b=0}} has the same proof theoretic ordinal &amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; as EFA and is conservative over EFA for &amp;Pi;{{su|p=0|b=2}} sentences.
* Weak Weak Kőnig's Lemma is the statement that a subtree of the infinite binary tree having no infinite paths has an asymptotically vanishing proportion of the leaves at length ''n'' (with a uniform estimate as to how many leaves of length ''n'' exist).   An equivalent formulation is that any subset of Cantor space that has positive measure is nonempty (this is not provable in RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). WWKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is obtained by adjoining this axiom to RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is equivalent to the statement that if the unit real interval is covered by a sequence of intervals then the sum of their lengths is at least one.  The model theory of WWKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is closely connected to the theory of [[algorithmically random sequence]]s.  In particular, an ω-model of RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies weak weak Kőnig's lemma if and only if for every set ''X'' there is a set ''Y'' which is 1-random relative to ''X''.
* DNR (short for "diagonally non-recursive") adds to RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; an axiom asserting the existence of a [[Kleene's recursion theorem#Fixed point free functions|diagonally non-recursive]] function relative to every set. That is, DNR states that, for any set ''A'', there exists a total function ''f'' such that for all ''e'' the ''e''th partial recursive function with oracle ''A'' is not equal to ''f''. DNR is strictly weaker than WWKL (Lempp ''et al.'', 2004).
* Δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-comprehension is in certain ways analogous to arithmetical transfinite recursion as recursive comprehension is to weak Kőnig's lemma.  It has the hyperarithmetical sets as minimal ω-model.  Arithmetical transfinite recursion proves Δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-comprehension but not the other way around.
* Σ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-choice is the statement that if η(''n'',''X'') is a Σ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; formula such that for each ''n'' there exists an ''X'' satisfying η then there is a sequence of sets ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that η(''n'',''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') holds for each ''n''.  Σ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-choice also has the hyperarithmetical sets as minimal ω-model.  Arithmetical transfinite recursion proves Σ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-choice but not the other way around.
* HBU (short for "uncountable Heine-Borel") expresses the (open-cover) [[compactness]] of the unit interval, involving ''uncountable covers''.  The latter aspect of HBU makes it only expressible in the language of ''third-order'' arithmetic.  [[Cousin's theorem]] (1895) implies HBU, and these theorems use the same notion of cover due to [[Cousin]] and [[Lindelöf]].  HBU is ''hard'' to prove: in terms of the usual hierarchy of comprehension axioms, a proof of HBU requires full second-order arithmetic ({{harvtxt|Normann-Sanders|2018}}).

==&amp;omega;-models and &amp;beta;-models==

The &amp;omega; in &amp;omega;-model stands for the set of non-negative integers (or finite ordinals). An &amp;omega;-model is a model for a fragment of second-order arithmetic  whose first-order part is the standard model of Peano arithmetic, but whose second-order part may be non-standard. More precisely, an &amp;omega;-model is given by a choice ''S''&amp;sube;2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt; of subsets of &amp;omega;. The first-order variables are interpreted in the usual way as elements of &amp;omega;, and +, &amp;times; have their usual meanings, while second-order variables are interpreted as elements of ''S''.  There is a standard &amp;omega; model where one just takes ''S'' to consist of all subsets of the integers. However, there are also other &amp;omega;-models; for example, RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; has a minimal &amp;omega;-model where ''S'' consists of the recursive subsets of &amp;omega;.

A &amp;beta; model is an &amp;omega; model that is equivalent to the standard &amp;omega;-model for &amp;Pi;{{su|p=1|b=1}} and &amp;Sigma;{{su|p=1|b=1}} sentences (with parameters).

Non-&amp;omega; models are also useful, especially in the proofs of conservation theorems.

The '''SRM Engine Suite''' is an engineering software tool used for simulating [[fuel]]s, [[combustion]] and [[exhaust gas]] emissions in [[internal combustion engine]] (IC engine) applications. It is used worldwide by leading IC engine development organisations and fuel companies. The software is developed, maintained and supported by CMCL Innovations,&lt;ref name="cmcl innovations" /&gt; Cambridge, U.K..

== Applications ==

# [[Exhaust gas]] emissions: Through the implementation of detailed [[chemical kinetics|chemical kinetic]] in both the gas &lt;ref name="load-speed"/&gt; and solid [[particulate]] &lt;ref name="Ethera2"/&gt; phases, all conventional automotive and [[Non-road engine|non-road]] [[exhaust gas]] emissions are simulated in detail.

== The model ==
The software is based on the [[stochastic]] reactor [[Computer model|model]] (SRM),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraft|first1=Markus|title=Stochastic Modeling of Turbulent Reacting Flow in Chemical Engineering|date=1998|publisher=VDI-Verlag|isbn=978-3-18-339106-6|edition=Fortschritt-Berichte, 391}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is stated in terms of a weighted stochastic particle ensemble. SRM is particular useful in the context of engine modelling &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraft|first1=M|last2=Maigaard|first2=P|last3=Mauss|first3=F|last4=Christensen|first4=M|last5=Johansson|first5=B|title=Investigation of combustion emissions in a homogeneous charge compression injection engine: Measurements and a new computational model|journal=Proceedings of the Combustion Institute|date=2000|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1195–1201|doi=10.1016/S0082-0784(00)80330-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
as the dynamics of the particle ensemble includes detailed [[chemical kinetics]]  whilst accounting for inhomogeneity in composition and [[temperature]] space arising from on-going [[fuel injection]], [[heat transfer]] and [[turbulence]] mixing events.  Through this coupling, heat release profiles and in particular the associated [[exhaust gas]] emissions ([[Particulates]], [[NOx]], [[Carbon monoxide]], [[uHCs|Unburned hydrocarbon]] ''etc''.) can be predicted more accurately than if using the more conventional approaches of standard homogenous and multi-zone reactor methods.&lt;ref name="Coble" /&gt;

==Coupling with third party software tools ==

The software can be coupled as a plug-in into 1D engine cycle software tools,&lt;ref name="Coble" /&gt; are capable of simulating the combustion and emissions during closed volume period of the cycle ([[combustion]], TDC and negative valve overlap).

An advanced [[Application programming interface]] enables for the model to be coupled with a user-defined codes such as 3D-CFD &lt;ref name="Char"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Cao| year = 2009 | title = Influence of Injection Timing and Piston Bowl Geometry on PCCI Combustion and Emissions | journal = SAE Technical Paper  | volume = 2 | pages = 1019–1033 | id = SAE 2009-01-1102 | doi= 10.4271/2009-01-1102| url = http://papers.sae.org/2009-01-1102/|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; or control &lt;ref name="h2" /&gt; software.

'''Squaring the square''' is the problem of [[tessellation|tiling]] an integral square using only other integral squares. (An '''integral square''' is a [[square (geometry)|square]] whose sides have [[integer]] length.) The name was coined in a humorous analogy with [[squaring the circle]]. Squaring the square is an easy task unless additional conditions are set.  The most studied restriction is that the squaring be '''perfect''', meaning that the sizes of the smaller squares are all different. A related problem is '''squaring the plane''', which can be done even with the restriction that each natural number occurs exactly once as a size of a square in the tiling. The order of a squared square is its number of constituent squares.

== Perfect squared squares ==

[[File:Smith diagram.png|right|thumb|300px|Smith diagram of a rectangle]]

A "perfect" squared square is a square such that each of the smaller squares has a different size.

It is first recorded as being studied by  [[R. Leonard Brooks|R. L. Brooks]], [[Cedric Smith (statistician)|C. A. B. Smith]], [[Arthur Harold Stone|A. H. Stone]] and [[W. T. Tutte]] at Cambridge University between 1936 and 1938.
They transformed the square tiling into an equivalent [[electrical circuit]] — they called it "Smith diagram" — by considering the squares as [[resistor]]s that connected to their neighbors at their top and bottom edges, and then applied [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] and [[circuit decomposition]] techniques to that circuit.  The first perfect squared squares they found were of order 69.

The first perfect squared square to be published, a compound one of side 4205 and order 55, was found by [[Roland Sprague]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-games5 |title=5. Towards a theory for combinatorial games |website=[[American Mathematical Society]] |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Gardner]] published an extensive article written by [[W. T. Tutte]] about the early history of squaring the square in his [[List of Martin Gardner Mathematical Games columns|mathematical games column]] in November 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.squaring.net/history_theory/brooks_smith_stone_tutte_II.html|title=Brooks, Smith, Stone and Tutte, II|author=|date=|website=www.squaring.net|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Squaring the square.svg|right|thumb|Lowest-order perfect squared square]]

== Simple squared squares ==

A "simple" squared square is one where no subset of the squares forms a rectangle or square, otherwise it is "compound".

In 1978, A. J. W. Duijvestijn discovered a simple perfect squared square of side 112 with the smallest number of squares using a computer search. His tiling uses 21 squares, and has been proved to be minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PerfectSquareDissection.html|title=Perfect Square Dissection|first=Weisstein, Eric|last=W.|date=|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This squared square forms the logo of the [[Trinity Mathematical Society]].

Duijvestijn also found 2 simple perfect squared squares of sides 110 but each comprising 22 squares. T.H. Willcocks found another. In 1999, I. Gambini proved that these 3 are the smallest perfect squared squares in terms of side length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Squared Squares; Perfect Simples, Perfect Compounds and Imperfect Simples|url=http://squaring.net/sq/ss/ss.html|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perfect compound squared square with the fewest squares was discovered by T.H. Willcocks in 1946 and has 24 squares; however, it was not until 1982 that Duijvestijn, [[Pasquale Joseph Federico]] and P. Leeuw mathematically proved it to be the lowest-order example.&lt;ref&gt;"Compound Perfect Squares", By A. J. W. Duijvestijn, P. J. Federico, and P. Leeuw,  Published in [http://www.maa.org/pubs/monthly.html American Mathematical Monthly] Volume 89 (1982) pp 15-32&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mrs. Perkins's quilt ==

When the constraint of all the squares being different sizes is relaxed, a squared square such that the side lengths of the smaller squares do not have a common divisor larger than 1 is called a "Mrs. Perkins's quilt".  In other words, the [[greatest common divisor]] of all the smaller side lengths should be 1.

The '''Mrs. Perkins's quilt problem''' is to find a Mrs. Perkins's quilt with the fewest pieces for a given {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} square.

It can be shown that aside from 2,3, and 5, every positive integer is cute.&lt;ref name="JBPJ"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry, JB|author2=Taylor, PJ|title=Challenge! 1999 - 2006 Book 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGwGvV4yZVMC&amp;pg=PA84|publisher=Australian Mathematics Trust|isbn=978-1-876420-23-9|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Squaring the plane ==

[[File:squaring_the_plane.svg|thumb|200px|Tiling the plane with different integral squares using the Fibonacci series
&lt;div style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em"&gt;1. Tiling with squares with Fibonacci-number sides is almost perfect except for 2 squares of side 1.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em"&gt;2. Duijvestijn found a 110-square tiled with 22 different integer squares.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em"&gt;3. Scaling the Fibonacci tiling by 110 times and replacing one of the 110-squares with Duijvestijn's perfects the tiling.&lt;/div&gt;]]
In 1975, [[Solomon Golomb]] raised the question whether the whole plane can be tiled by squares, one of each integer edge-length, which he called the '''heterogeneous tiling conjecture'''. This problem was later publicized by Martin Gardner in his [[Scientific American]] column and appeared in several books, but it defied solution for over 30 years.

In ''Tilings and Patterns'', published in 1987, [[Branko Grünbaum]] and G. C. Shephard stated that in all perfect integral tilings of the plane known at that time, the sizes of the squares [[exponential growth|grew exponentially]]. For example, the plane can be tiled with different integral squares, but not for every integer, by recursively taking any perfect squared square and enlarging it so that the formerly smallest tile now has the size of the original squared square, then replacing this tile with a copy of the original squared square.

In 2008 James Henle and Frederick Henle proved that this, in fact, can be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henle | first1 = Frederick V. | last2 = Henle | first2 = James M. | year = 2008 | title = Squaring the plane | journal = American Mathematical Monthly | volume = 115 | issue = | pages = 3–12 | jstor=27642387}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their proof is constructive and proceeds by "puffing up" an L-shaped region formed by two side-by-side and horizontally flush squares of different sizes to a perfect tiling of a larger rectangular region, then adjoining the square of the smallest size not yet used to get another, larger L-shaped region. The squares added during the puffing up procedure have sizes that have not yet appeared in the construction and the procedure is set up so that the resulting rectangular regions are expanding in all four directions, which leads to a tiling of the whole plane.

== Cubing the cube ==

'''Cubing the cube''' is the analogue in three dimensions of squaring the square: that is, given a [[cube]] ''C'', the problem of dividing it into finitely many smaller cubes, no two congruent.

Unlike the case of squaring the square, a hard yet solvable problem, there is no perfect cubed cube and, more generally, no dissection of a [[Cuboid#Rectangular cuboid|rectangular cuboid]] ''C'' into a finite number of unequal cubes.

Suppose that there is such a dissection. Make a face of ''C'' its horizontal base. The base is divided into a perfect squared rectangle ''R'' by the cubes which rest on it. Each corner square of ''R'' has a smaller adjacent edge square, and ''R'''s smallest edge square is adjacent to smaller squares not on the edge. Therefore, the smallest square ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in ''R'' is surrounded by ''larger'', and therefore ''higher'', cubes on all four sides. Hence the upper face of the cube on ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is divided into a perfect squared square by the cubes which rest on it. Let ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be the smallest square in this dissection. The sequence of squares ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... is infinite and the corresponding cubes are infinite in number. This contradicts our original supposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brooks |first1=R. L.|last2=Smith|first2=C. A. B. |last3=Stone |first3=A. H. |last4=Tutte |first4=W.

&lt;/ref&gt;

If a 4-dimensional [[hypercube]] could be perfectly hypercubed then its 'faces' would be perfect cubed cubes; this is impossible. Similarly, there is no solution for all cubes of higher dimensions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4056">'''Stein's lemma''',&lt;ref&gt;Ingersoll, J., ''Theory of Financial Decision Making'', Rowman and Littlefield, 1987: 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; named in honor of [[Charles Stein (statistician)|Charles Stein]], is a [[theorem]] of [[probability theory]] that is of interest primarily because of its applications to [[statistical inference]] &amp;mdash; in particular, to [[James–Stein estimation]] and [[empirical Bayes method]]s &amp;mdash; and its applications to [[modern portfolio theory|portfolio choice theory]]. The theorem gives a formula for the [[covariance]] of one [[random variable]] with the value of a function of another, when the two random variables are [[joint normal distribution|jointly normally distributed]].

==Statement of the lemma==
Suppose ''X'' is a [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] [[random variable]] with [[expected value|expectation]] μ and [[variance]] σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Further suppose ''g'' is a function for which the two expectations E(''g''(''X'') (''X'' &amp;minus; μ) ) and E( ''g'' &amp;prime;(''X'') ) both exist (the existence of the expectation of any random variable is equivalent to the finiteness of the expectation of its [[absolute value]]).  Then

:&lt;math&gt;E\bigl(g(X)(X-\mu)\bigr)=\sigma^2 E\bigl(g'(X)\bigr).&lt;/math&gt;

In general, suppose ''X'' and ''Y'' are jointly normally distributed. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(g(X),Y)= \operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)E(g'(X)).&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
{{Main|Proof of Stein's example#Sketched proof}}

In order to prove the univariate version of this lemma, recall that the [[probability density function]] for the normal distribution with expectation 0 and variance 1 is

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)={1 \over \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-x^2/2}&lt;/math&gt;

and that for a normal distribution with expectation μ and variance σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over\sigma}\varphi\left({x-\mu \over \sigma}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Then use [[integration by parts]].

==More general statement==
Suppose ''X'' is in an [[exponential family]], that is, ''X'' has the density

:&lt;math&gt;f_\eta(x)=\exp(\eta'T(x) - \Psi(\eta))h(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose this density has support &lt;math&gt;(a,b) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; a,b &lt;/math&gt; could be &lt;math&gt; -\infty ,\infty&lt;/math&gt; and as  &lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow a\text{ or }b&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; \exp (\eta'T(x))h(x) g(x) \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;  is any differentiable function such that &lt;math&gt;E|g'(X)|&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; or  &lt;math&gt;  \exp (\eta'T(x))h(x) \rightarrow 0 &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; a,b &lt;/math&gt; finite. Then 

:&lt;math&gt;E((h'(X)/h(X) + \sum \eta_i T_i'(X))g(X)) = -Eg'(X). &lt;/math&gt;

The derivation is same as the special case, namely, integration by parts.

If we only know &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; has support  &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;, then it could be the case that &lt;math&gt; E|g(X)| &lt;\infty \text{ and } E|g'(X)| &lt;\infty &lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} f_\eta(x) g(x) \not= 0&lt;/math&gt;. To see this, simply put &lt;math&gt;g(x)=1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f_\eta(x) &lt;/math&gt; with infinitely spikes towards infinity but still integrable. One such example could be adapted from &lt;math&gt; f(x) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; x \in [n, n + 2^{-n}) \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; is smooth. 

Extensions to elliptically-contoured distributions also exist.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Technical drawing''', '''drafting''' or '''drawing''', is the act and [[Academic discipline|discipline]] of composing [[Plan (drawing)|drawings]] that [[Visual communication|visually communicate]] how something functions or is constructed.

Technical drawing is essential for communicating ideas in [[industry]] and [[engineering]].
To make the drawings easier to understand, people use familiar [[symbols]], [[Perspective (graphical)|perspectives]], [[units of measurement]], [[notation]] systems, visual styles, and [[page layout]]. Together, such [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] constitute a [[visual language]] and help to ensure that the drawing is [[unambiguous]] and relatively easy to understand. Many of the symbols and principles of technical drawing are codified in an [[international standard]] called [[ISO 128]].

The need for precise communication in the preparation of a functional document distinguishes technical drawing from the expressive drawing of the [[visual arts]]. Artistic drawings are subjectively interpreted; their meanings are multiply determined. Technical drawings are understood to have one intended meaning.&lt;ref name="g2000p3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Technical Drawing |edition=Fourth |last=Goetsch |first=David L. |last2=Chalk |first2=William S. |last3=Nelson |first3=John A. |year=2000 |publisher=Delmar Learning |series=Delmar Technical Graphics Series |location=[[Albany, New York|Albany]] |isbn=978-0-7668-0531-6 |oclc=39756434 |page=3 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[drafter]]'', ''draftsperson'', or ''draughtsman'' is a person who makes a [[drawing]] (technical or expressive). A professional drafter who makes technical drawings is sometimes called a ''drafting technician''.

==Methods==
===Sketching===
[[File:Architekturskizze Verwaltungsgebäude Biel.jpg|thumb|210px|right|[[Sketch (drawing)|Sketch]] for a government building]]

A [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]] is a quickly executed, freehand drawing that is usually not intended as a finished work. In general, sketching is a quick way to record an idea for later use. Architect's sketches primarily serve as a way to try out different ideas and establish a composition before  a more finished work, especially when the finished work is expensive and time-consuming.

Architectural sketches, for example, are a kind of [[diagram]]s.&lt;ref name="BoCo04"&gt;Richard Boland and Fred Collopy (2004). ''Managing as designing''. Stanford University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-8047-4674-5}}, p.69.&lt;/ref&gt; These sketches, like [[metaphor]]s, are used by architects as a means of communication in aiding design collaboration. This tool helps architects to abstract attributes of hypothetical provisional design solutions and summarize their complex patterns, hereby enhancing the design process.&lt;ref name="BoCo04"/&gt;

===Manual or by instrument===
[[File:Zeichenmaschine.jpg|thumb|left|A drafting table]]
[[File:Technical drawing instruments 1.jpg|thumb|right|Old-fashioned technical drawing instruments]]
[[File:Stencils01.jpg|thumb|right|Stencils for lettering technical drawings to DIN standards]]
The basic drafting procedure is to place a piece of paper (or other material) on a smooth surface with right-angle corners and straight sides—typically a [[drawing board]]. A sliding [[straightedge]] known as a ''[[T-square]]'' is then placed on one of the sides, allowing it to be slid across the side of the table, and over the surface of the paper.

"Parallel lines" can be drawn simply by moving the T-square and running a pencil or [[technical pen]] along the T-square's edge. The T-square is used to hold other devices such as [[set square]]s or triangles. In this case, the drafter places one or more triangles of known angles on the T-square—which is itself at right angles to the edge of the table—and can then draw lines at any chosen angle to others on the page. Modern drafting tables come equipped with a [[drafting machine]] that is supported on both sides of the table to slide over a large piece of paper. Because it is secured on both sides, lines drawn along the edge are guaranteed to be parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhatt|first=N.D|title=Machine Drawing|publisher=Charotar Publication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the drafter uses several [[technical drawing tools]] to draw curves and circles. Primary among these are the [[Compass (drafting)|compasses]], used for drawing simple arcs and circles, and the [[French curve]], for drawing curves. A [[Flat spline|spline]] is a rubber coated articulated metal that can be manually bent to most curves.

Drafting templates assist the drafter with creating recurring objects in a drawing without having to reproduce the object from scratch every time. This is especially useful when using common symbols; i.e. in the context of [[stagecraft]], a lighting designer will draw from the [[USITT]] standard library of lighting fixture symbols to indicate the position of a common fixture across multiple positions. Templates are sold commercially by a number of vendors, usually customized to a specific task, but it is also not uncommon for a drafter to create his own templates.

This basic drafting system requires an accurate table and constant attention to the positioning of the tools. A common error is to allow the triangles to push the top of the T-square down slightly, thereby throwing off all angles. Even tasks as simple as drawing two angled lines meeting at a point require a number of moves of the T-square and triangles, and in general, drafting can be a time-consuming process.

A solution to these problems was the introduction of the mechanical "drafting machine", an application of the [[pantograph]] (sometimes referred to incorrectly as a "pentagraph" in these situations) which allowed the drafter to have an accurate right angle at any point on the page quite quickly. These machines often included the ability to change the angle, thereby removing the need for the triangles as well.

In addition to the mastery of the mechanics of drawing lines, arcs and circles (and text) onto a piece of paper—with respect to the detailing of physical objects—the drafting effort requires a thorough understanding of geometry, trigonometry and spatial comprehension, and in all cases demands precision and accuracy, and attention to detail of high order.

Although drafting is sometimes accomplished by a project engineer, architect, or shop personnel (such as a [[machinist]]), skilled drafters (and/or designers) usually accomplish the task, and are always in demand to some degree.

===Computer aided design===
{{Main article|Computer-aided design}}

Today, the mechanics of the drafting task have largely been automated and accelerated through the use of [[computer-aided design]] systems (CAD).

There are two types of computer-aided design systems used for the production
of technical drawings" [[2D computer graphics|two dimensions]] ("2D") and [[3D computer graphics|three dimensions]] ("3D").

2D CAD systems such as [[AutoCAD]] or [[MicroStation]] replace the paper drawing discipline. The lines, circles, arcs, and curves are created within the software. It is down to the technical drawing skill of the user to produce the drawing. There is still much scope for error in the drawing when producing first and third angle orthographic projections, auxiliary projections and cross sections. A 2D CAD system is merely an electronic drawing board. Its greatest strength over direct to paper technical drawing is in the making of revisions. Whereas in a conventional hand drawn technical drawing, if a mistake is found, or a modification is required, a new drawing must be made from scratch, the 2D CAD system allows a copy of the original to be modified, saving considerable time. 2D CAD systems can be used to create plans for large projects such as buildings and aircraft but provide no way to check the various components will fit together.

A 3D CAD system (such as [[KeyCreator]], [[Autodesk Inventor]], or [[SolidWorks]]) first produces the geometry of the part; the technical drawing comes from user defined views of that geometry. Any orthographic, projected or sectioned view is created by the software. There is no scope for error in the production of these views. The main scope for error comes in setting the parameter of first or third angle projection and displaying the relevant symbol on the technical drawing. 3D CAD allows individual parts to be assembled together to represent the final product. Buildings, aircraft, ships, and cars are modeled, assembled, and checked in 3D before technical drawings are released for manufacture.

Both 2D and 3D CAD systems can be used to produce technical drawings for any discipline. The various disciplines (electrical, electronic, pneumatic, hydraulic, etc.) have industry recognized symbols to represent common components.

BS and ISO produce standards to show recommended practices but it is up to individuals to produce the drawings. There is no definitive standard for layout or style. The only standard across engineering workshop drawings is in the creation of orthographic projections and [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|cross section]] views.

Drafting can represent [[2D computer graphics|two dimensions]] ("2D") and [[3D computer graphics|three dimensions]] ("3D") although the representation itself is always created in 2D (cf. [[Architectural model]]). Drafting is the integral communication of technical or engineering drawings and is the [[industrial arts]] sub-discipline that underlies all involved technical endeavors.

In representing complex, three-dimensional objects in two-dimensional drawings, the objects can be described by at least one view plus material thickness note, 2, 3 or as many views and sections that are required to show all features of object.

{{Main article|Architectural drawing}}

The art and design that goes into making buildings is known as "architecture". To communicate all aspects of the shape or design, detail drawings are used. In this field, the term ''[[Plan (drawing)|plan]]'' is often used when referring to the full section view of these drawings as viewed from three feet above finished floor to show the locations of doorways, windows, stairwells, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferis, Alan; Madsen, David (2005), Architectural Drafting and Design (5th ed.), Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Cengage Learning, {{ISBN|1-4018-6715-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Architectural drawings describe and document an architect's design.&lt;ref&gt;Goetsch et al. (2000) p. 792&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering===
{{Main article|Engineering drawing}}
{{See also|Mechanical engineering}}

Engineering can be a very broad term. It stems from the Latin ''ingenerare'', meaning "to create".&lt;ref&gt;Lieu, Dennis K; Sorby, Sheryl (2009), ''Visualization, Modeling, and Graphics for Engineering Design'' (1st ed.), Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Cengage Learning, {{ISBN|1-4018-4249-6}}, p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  Because this could apply to everything that humans create, it is given a narrower definition in the context of technical drawing. Engineering drawings generally deal with mechanical engineered items, such as manufactured parts and equipment.

[[File:DIN 69893 hsk 63a drawing.png|thumb|210px|left|[[Engineering drawing]] of a [[machine tool]] part]]
Engineering drawings are usually created in accordance with standardized conventions for layout, nomenclature, interpretation, appearance (such as [[typeface]]s and line styles), size, etc.

Its purpose is to accurately and unambiguously capture all the geometric features of a product or a component. The end goal of an engineering drawing is to convey all the required information that will allow a manufacturer to produce that component.

[[File:Drum set.svg|thumb|210px|[[Technical illustration|Illustration]] of a drum set]]

{{Main article|Technical illustration}}

''Technical illustration'' is the use of [[illustration]] to visually communicate information of a technical nature. Technical illustrations can be component technical drawings or [[diagram]]s. The aim of technical illustration is "to generate expressive [[image]]s that effectively convey certain [[information]] via the visual channel to the human observer".&lt;ref name="ViGr05"&gt;Ivan Viola and Meister E. Gröller (2005). "Smart Visibility in Visualization". In: ''Computational Aesthetics in Graphics, Visualization and Imaging''. L. Neumann et al. (Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The main purpose of technical illustration is to describe or explain these items to a more or less nontechnical audience. The visual image should be accurate in terms of dimensions and proportions, and should provide "an overall impression of what an object is or does, to enhance the viewer’s interest and understanding".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industriegrafik.com/TIE1.htm www.industriegrafik.com The Role of the Technical Illustrator in Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814125052/http://www.industriegrafik.com/TIE1.htm |date=14 August 2009 }} webarticle, Last modified: Juni 15, 2002. Accessed 15 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Viola (2005), "illustrative techniques are often designed in a way that even a person with no technical understanding clearly understands the piece of art. The use of varying line widths to emphasize mass, proximity, and scale helped to make a simple line drawing more understandable to the lay person. Cross hatching, stippling, and other low abstraction techniques gave greater depth and dimension to the subject matter".&lt;ref name="ViGr05"/&gt;

====Cutaway drawing====
[[File:1942 Nash Ambassador X-ray.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Cutaway drawing]] of the [[Nash 600]], an American car of the 1940s]]
{{Main article|Cutaway drawing}}

A ''cutaway drawing'' is a technical illustration, in which part of the surface of a three-dimensional model is removed in order to show some of the model's interior in relation to its exterior.

The purpose of a cutaway drawing is to "allow the viewer to have a look into an otherwise solid opaque object. Instead of letting the inner object shine through the surrounding surface, parts of outside object are simply removed. This produces a visual appearance as if someone had cutout a piece of the object or sliced it into parts. Cutaway illustrations avoid ambiguities with respect to spatial ordering, provide a sharp contrast between foreground and background objects, and facilitate a good understanding of spatial ordering".&lt;ref name="DWE03"&gt;J. Diepstraten, D. Weiskopf &amp; T. Ertl (2003). [http://www.vis.uni-stuttgart.de/~weiskopf/publications/eg2003.pdf "Interactive Cutaway Illustrations"]. in: ''Eurographics 2003''. P. Brunet and D. Fellner (ed). Vol 22 (2003), Nr 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical drawings==

===Types===
The two types of technical drawings are based on [[graphical projection]].&lt;ref name="g2000p3"/&gt;  This is used to create an image of a three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional surface.

====Two-dimensional representation====
Two-dimensional representation uses [[orthographic projection]] to create an image where only two of the three dimensions of the object are seen.

====Three-dimensional representation====
In a three-dimensional representation, also referred to as a pictorial, all three dimensions of an object are visible.

===Views===

====Multiview====
{{Main article|Multiview orthographic projection}}
Multiview is a type of [[orthographic projection]]. There are two conventions for using multiview, first-angle and third-angle. In both cases, the front or main side of the object is the same. First-angle is drawing the object sides based on where they land. Example, looking at the front side, rotate the object 90&amp;nbsp;degrees to the right. What is seen will be drawn to the right of the front side. Third-angle is drawing the object sides based on where they are. Example, looking at the front side, rotate the object 90&amp;nbsp;degrees to the right. What is seen is actually the left side of the object and will be drawn to the left of the front side

====Section====
While multiview relates to external surfaces of an object, section views show an imaginary plane cut through an object. This is often useful to show voids in an object.

====Auxiliary====
Auxiliary views utilize an additional projection plane other than the common planes in a multiview. Since the features of an object need to show the true shape and size of the object, the projection plane must be parallel to the object surface. Therefore, any surface that is not in line with the three major axis needs its own projection plane to show the features correctly.

====Pattern====
Patterns, sometimes called developments, show the size and shape of a flat piece of material needed for later bending or folding into a three-dimensional shape.&lt;ref&gt;Goetsch et al. (2000), p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exploded====
{{Main article|Exploded-view drawing}}
[[Image:Gear pump exploded.png|thumb|210px|[[Exploded-view drawing]] of a [[gear pump]]]]

An ''exploded-view drawing'' is a technical drawing of an object that shows the relationship or order of [[manufacturing|assembly]] of the various parts.&lt;ref name="US PTO05"&gt;[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (2005), [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/#drawing General Information Concerning Patents § 1.84 Standards for drawings] (Revised January 2005). Accessed 13 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the components of an object slightly separated by distance or suspended in surrounding space in the case of a three-[[dimension]]al exploded diagram. An object is represented as if there had been a small controlled [[explosion]] emanating from the middle of the object, causing the object's parts to be separated relative distances away from their original locations.

An exploded view drawing (EVD) can show the intended assembly of mechanical or other parts. In mechanical systems usually the component closest to the center is assembled first or is the main part in which the other parts get assembled. This drawing can also help to represent disassembly of parts, where the parts on the outside normally get removed first.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Brumbach, Jeffrey A. Clade (2003). ''Industrial Maintenance''. Cengage Learning, 2003
{{ISBN|0-7668-2695-3}}, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standards and conventions===

====Basic drafting paper sizes====
{{Main article|Paper size}}

There have been many standard sizes of [[paper]] at different times and in different countries, but today most of the world uses the international standard (A4 and its siblings). North America uses its own sizes.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Patent drawing===
[[File:Wright brothers patent plans 1908.jpg|thumb|210px|The [[Wright brothers]]' [[patent drawing]]s for their aeroplane (1908)]]
{{Main article|Patent drawing}}

The applicant for a [[patent]] will be required by [[law]] to furnish a [[drawing]] of the [[invention]] if or when the nature of the case requires a drawing to understand the invention with the job. This drawing must be filed with the application. This includes practically all inventions except [[wikt:composition|composition]]s of matter or [[Industrial process|process]]es, but a drawing may also be useful in the case of many processes.&lt;ref name="US PTO05"/&gt;

The drawing must show every feature of the invention [[specification|specified]] in the claims and is required by the [[patent office]] rules to be in a particular form. The Office specifies the size of the sheet on which the drawing is made, the type of paper, the margins, and other details relating to the making of the drawing. The reason for specifying the standards in detail is that the drawings are printed and published in a uniform style when the patent issues and the drawings must also be such that they can be readily understood by persons using the patent descriptions.&lt;ref name="US PTO05"/&gt;

===Sets of technical drawings===

====Working drawings for production====
[[Working drawing]]s are the set of technical drawings used during the manufacturing phase of a product.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph W. Liebing (1999). ''Architectural working drawings''. John Wiley and Sons, 1999. {{ISBN|0-471-34876-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In architecture, these include [[civil drawing]]s, [[architectural drawing]]s, [[structural drawing]]s, [[mechanical systems drawing]]s, [[electrical drawing]]s, and [[plumbing drawing]]s.

====Assembly drawings====
Assembly drawings show how different parts go together, identify those parts by number, and have a parts list, often referred to as a bill of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Goetsch et al. (2000), p. 613&lt;/ref&gt;  In a technical service manual, this type of drawing may be referred to as an [[exploded view drawing]] or diagram.
These parts may be used in engineering.

====As-fitted drawings====
Also called ''As-Built drawings'' or ''As-made drawings''. '''As-fitted drawings''' represent a record of the completed works, literally 'as fitted'. These are based upon the ''working drawings'' and updated to reflect any changes or alterations undertaken during construction or manufacture.&lt;ref name="BusinessDictionary.com 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=as-built drawings| website=BusinessDictionary.com | date=2017-12-26 | url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/as-built-drawings.html | access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''wait/walk dilemma''' occurs when waiting for a [[bus]] at a [[bus stop]], when the duration of the wait may exceed the time needed to arrive at a destination by another means, especially walking. 
Some work on this problem was featured in the 2008 "Year in Ideas" issue of ''The New York Times Magazine''.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite web

|class=math.HO}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1990, writer Tom Parker had made the observation that "walking is faster than waiting for a bus, if you're going less than a mile".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/79230732/ Excerpts from the book "Never Trust a Calm Dog and Other Rules of Thumb", as reproduced in the Gatesway Messenger]. May 22, 1996. Retrieved 9 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard]] mathematics major Scott D. Kominers first began fixating on the problem while walking from [[MIT]] to [[Harvard]],&lt;ref name=Bierman/&gt; which are more than a mile apart in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] along [[Key MBTA bus routes|MBTA bus route 1]]. He enlisted the help of [[Caltech]] physics major Justin G. Chen and [[Harvard]] statistics major Robert W. Sinnott to perform the analysis.&lt;ref name=Bierman/&gt;

Their paper concludes that it is usually mathematically quicker to wait for the bus{{Dubious|Dubious conclusion|date=July 2018}}, at least for a little while. But once made, the decision to walk should be final, as opposed to waiting again at subsequent stops.&lt;ref name=Bierman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;

The corresponding problem in interstellar travel is called the [[wait calculation]], which tries to determine the optimal time to wait for technological progress to improve spaceship speeds, before committing to the journey.
