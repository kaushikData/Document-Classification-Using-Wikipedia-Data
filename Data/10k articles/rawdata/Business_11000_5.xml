'''55 Water Street''' is a {{convert|687|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[skyscraper]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]], on the [[East River]]. The 53-story, {{convert|3.5|e6sqft|m2|sigfig=3|adj=on}} structure was completed in 1972. [[Emery Roth &amp; Sons]] designed the building, which is tied with [[277 Park Avenue]] as the 40th-tallest building in New York City. When it was completed it was the largest office building in the world, and is still the largest in New York by floor area. In an arrangement with the Office of Lower Manhattan Development, it was built on a [[city block#Superblock|superblock]] created from four adjoining city blocks, suppressing the western part of Front Street.

Its closest competitors in square footage are the [[Met Life Building]] at {{convert|3140000|sqft}} and [[111 Eighth Avenue]] at {{convert|2900000|sqft}}. [[One World Trade Center]] has roughly the same square footage (3.5 million square feet).  The now-destroyed [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] was bigger when it opened in 1973.

==Description==

On the north side of the tower is a 15-story wing with a sloping facade and terraces facing the river. The largest terrace forms a [[privately owned public space]] known as the "Elevated Acre", about 30 feet above street level and accessible via escalator and stairs from the sidewalk on Water Street. The creation of public space allowed the developers to increase the total square footage of 55 Water Street beyond what zoning regulations would otherwise have allowed on the site. The Elevated Acre was originally planned as part of a series of high-level public spaces along East River, to be connected with walkways running above the street level. The Elevated Acre is available for rental as a venue for special events and weddings and during the summer months occasionally hosts free movie screenings open to the community. The original {{convert|4800|m2|sqft|adj=on}} plaza was designed by [[M. Paul Friedberg]] &amp; Associates, and had the same red brick tiles as his Jeannette Park to the south of the tower. In early 2001, [[Goldman Sachs]] briefly considered leasing space in 55 Water Street and proposed building a 13-story, 240-foot addition on the plaza site which would have included seven large trading floors. The plan also proposed adding 35 feet to the north tower. To compensate for the loss of public space, Goldman Sachs proposed paying for various improvements of public space nearby. The plans were quickly dropped and Goldman Sachs cited economic conditions as the reason although some neighborhood residents had begun to voice opposition.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} The building, its plazas and Jeannette Park have been renovated and redesigned by [[Lee Jablin|Lee S. Jablin]] of Harman Jablin Architects. The Elevated Acre was renovated in 2005 by Rogers Marvel Architects and Ken Smith Landscape Architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Dunlap | first= David W. | title= Putting a Shine on a Memorial Long Forlorn | publisher= The New York Times| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/24/nyregion/commercial-real-estate-putting-shine-memorial-long-forlorn-project-will-reshape.html?pagewanted=all |date= May 24, 2000 |accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first= David W. |last= Dunlap |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/28/nyregion/commercial-real-estate-a-plaza-few-use-but-everyone-wants.html |title=Commercial Real Estate; A Plaza Few Use But Everyone Wants |publisher=The New York Times |date=February 28, 2001 |accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David W.|last= Dunlap |date=March 7, 2001 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/07/nyregion/goldman-sachs-drops-plans-for-new-tower-at-plaza-site.html |title=Goldman Sachs Drops Plans For New Tower at Plaza Site |publisher= The New York Times |accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_128/7millionplazareachingahigh.html |title=$7 million plaza reaching a higher level reopens |publisher=DowntownExpress.com |accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

55 Water Street was the last major building built by [[Uris Buildings Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.emporis.com/company/uris-brothers-new-york-city-ny-usa |title=Uris Brothers &amp;#124; Companies |publisher=Emporis |date= |accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

From 1973 to 1983, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] maintained a branch museum in the building; space was rented for a token fee and the operating cost was paid for by several [[Wall Street]] corporations.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Since 1993, the building has been owned by [[Retirement Systems of Alabama]] who acquired it from [[Olympia &amp; York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date= October 10, 1993 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/realestate/postings-55-water-street-new-start-for-a-troubled-building.html |title=55 Water Street: New Start for a Troubled Building |publisher= The New York Times |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 29, 2012, the building was among many along the Lower Manhattan waterfront that sustained [[Effects of Hurricane Sandy in New York|damage related to Hurricane Sandy]] when over {{convert |32|e6USgal|kl}} of water flooded three underground levels and rose to waist-high in the lobby.  On November 23, 2012, while repairs were being conducted a fire caused injuries to 27 people—mostly those working on the lower levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NYC high-rise fire leaves 27 with smoke inhalation|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-nyc-high-rise-fire-leaves-27-with-smoke-inhalation-2012nov23-story.html|work=The San-Diego Union Tribune|agency=The Associated Press|date=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To prepare for future storms the building's owner plans to relocate electrical equipment from the basement to the third floor starting in late 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Steve Cuozzo|Cuozzo]] |first=Steve |url= https://nypost.com/2012/12/04/waiting-for-water-street/ |title=Waiting for Water Street |publisher=New York Post |date=2012-12-04 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A flood control infrastructure was also installed around the perimeter of the building to mitigate any flooding should a storm of similar magnitude effect the location in the future.

'''Alexander Yevgenievich Lebedev''' ({{lang-rus|Алекса́ндр Евге́ньевич Ле́бедев|p=ɐlʲɪˈksandr jɪvˈɡʲenʲjɪvʲɪtɕ ˈlʲebʲɪdʲɪf}}; born 16 December 1959) is a [[Russians|Russian]] [[businessman]], referred to as one of the [[Russian oligarchs]].

In early 2008, he was one of the golden 100 top Russian billionaires listed as the 39th richest Russian worth an estimated [[United States dollar|US$]]3.1 billion by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, but by October 2008 he was worth only $300 million.&lt;ref name=Guardian081024&gt;{{cite news | last = Harding | first = Luke | title = Twilight of the oligarchs: Communism's collapse made them multi-billionaires, but now Russian capitalism is in trouble.

His fortune has since declined, and he is no longer considered to be a billionaire.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/alexander-lebedev/ |title=Alexander Lebedev |website=Forbes.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is part owner of the Russian newspaper ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]''&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elliott|first1=John|last2=Ungoed-Thomas|first2=Jon|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tycoon-linked-with-litvinenko-survived-poisoning-cpklclqbfn7|title=Tycoon linked with Litvinenko 'survived poisoning'|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=7 January 2007|accessdate=12 June 2018}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and owner of two UK newspapers with son [[Evgeny Lebedev]]: the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]''.

== Early life and education ==
Alexander Lebedev was born in [[Moscow]]. His parents were part of the Moscow [[intelligentsia]]. His father, Yevgeny Nikolaevich Lebedev, was an elite athlete–a member of the Soviet national [[water polo]] team, and later a professor at the [[Moscow State Technical University|Bauman Moscow State Technical University]], Moscow's highest technical school. After graduating from Moscow Pedagogic Institute, Alexander's mother, Maria Sergeyevna, worked in a rural [[Sakhalin]] school and later taught English in a Moscow tertiary school.&lt;ref name=Pers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alebedev.ru/biograph/index.htm |title=Archived item |accessdate=13 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006123109/http://www.alebedev.ru/biograph/index.htm |archivedate=6 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Alexander Lebedev entered the Department of Economics at [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]]. After he graduated in 1982, Lebedev started work at the Institute of Economics of the World Socialist System doing research for his [[Kandidat]] (between master's degree and doctorate) dissertation, ''The problems of debt and the challenges of globalization''. He transferred to the [[First Chief Directorate]] (Foreign Intelligence) of [[KGB]]. According to ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', as a KGB spy, he was based at the Russian embassy in London during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; He worked for the KGB's successor, the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Foreign Intelligence Service]], until 1992.&lt;ref name=Pers/&gt; Lebedev had the diplomatic cover of an economics [[attaché]]. According to his personal website, Lebedev's assignments included fighting [[capital flight]] from the Russian Federation.&lt;ref name=Pers/&gt;

==Business career==
[[File:Vladimir Putin 7 May 2002-4.jpg|thumb|right|Lebedev with [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] on 7 May 2002]]
Upon leaving the Russian intelligence community, Lebedev set up his first company, the Russian Investment-Finance Company. In 1995 this bought the [[National Reserve Bank (Russia)|National Reserve Bank]], a small Russian bank which was in trouble at the time. The bank subsequently grew rapidly to become one of Russia's largest banks. It and the [[Alfa-Bank]] were the only two out of the ten biggest Russian banks to survive the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harding |first=Luke |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/11/alexander-lebedev-russia-oligarch | 
title=Alexander Lebedev: an oligarch we could learn to love |work=[[The Observer]]|date=11 January 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the bank's assets are:
* 11% of the main Russian national airline [[Aeroflot]]&lt;ref name="Leb_BNE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bne.eu/story4206/Alexander_Lebedev_cashing_out_of_Russia |title=Archived item |accessdate=22 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111102042/http://www.bne.eu/story4206/Alexander_Lebedev_cashing_out_of_Russia |archivedate=11 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 44% of the [[Ilyushin]] Finance Co, that owns a significant share of Russian aircraft-building industry
* significant parts of [[Sberbank]], [[Gazprom]], [[RAO UES]]
The bank is the core of the group of companies holding National Reserve Corporation, that according to Lebedev's personal site owns around US$2 billion of assets.&lt;ref name=Pers/&gt; In March 2006, ''Forbes'' estimates Lebedev's fortune as high as US$3.5 billion,&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; but as of July 2013 he dropped out of the billionaires list and is no longer considered to be a billionaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/eiif45gddj/alexander-lebedev-2/ |title=Alexander Lebedev|page=9 |work=Forbes|date= |accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Reserve Corporation included the National Land Company (the biggest potato producer in Russia), National Housing Corporation (construction of affordable houses), National Mortgage Company (Национальная Ипотечная Компания), as well as interests in [[textiles]], [[telecommunications]], [[tram]]s and [[trolleybus]]es, [[electrical power industry|electrical power]], [[chemical industry|chemical]] and [[tourist industry|tourist]] industries owning a large hotel network in [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] and plan to create the National Reserve Park that will manage diverse tourist enterprises in Russia, Ukraine and [[France]].

Lebedev used to own the ''[[Moskovski Korrespondent]]'', but according to [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' programme, Lebedev closed it down "for political reasons after it published a spurious article about Vladimir Putin having an affair with an Olympic gymnast half his age".&lt;ref&gt;Jon Ungoed-Thomas and Marie Woolf [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6936282.ece "Oligarchs hire ‘do-nothing’ peers to boost their prestige",] ''The Sunday Times'', 29 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 January 2009, Lebedev and his company [[Evening Press Corporation (UK)]], part of Lebedev Holdings, bought approximately a 75.1% of share in the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'' newspaper for £1. The previous owners, the [[Daily Mail and General Trust]], continue to hold 24.9% in the company in the new firm, named [[Evening Standard Ltd]]. Lebedev promised to not interfere with the editorial running of the paper. Lebedev commented that during his time as a spy in London, he used the ''Evening Standard'' to find information.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7841891.stm|title=Ex-KGB spy buys UK paper for £1|work=[[BBC News]]|date=21 January 2009|accessdate=21 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Dacre]], the editor-in-chief of the ''Evening Standard'' at the time of the sale said: "It's a very sad day for the paper, it's a very sad day for the [[Viscount Rothermere|Rothermeres]].

In 2009 he entered into exclusive negotiations with [[Independent News &amp; Media]] to buy the company's British national newspapers, ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''Independent on Sunday''. Before the purchase was completed, his representatives offered the editorship of ''The Independent'' to [[Rod Liddle]], former editor of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|''Today'' Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sweney|first1=Mark|last2=Brook|first2=Stephen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/08/rod-liddle-edit-independent|title=Rod Liddle lined up to edit ''Independent''|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=8 January 2010|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offer was withdrawn after Liddle's putative appointment was opposed by the newspaper's staff and by a campaign online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenslade|first=Roy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2010/jan/11/theindependent-simon-kelner|title=Independent faces revolt from staff and readers if Liddle becomes editor|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=11 January 2010|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brook|first=Stephen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2010/feb/19/rod-liddle-independent|title=Rod Liddle no longer in running for Independent editor|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=19 February 2010|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March 2010, Lebedev bought ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''Independent on Sunday'' for £1.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8587469.stm|title=The Independent bought by Lebedev for £1|publisher=BBC News|date=25 March 2010|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, National Reserve Bank (NRB) faced difficulties: corporate deposits decreased by 2.2bn rubles, retail deposits by 1.2bn rubles. 20% of the bank's liabilities had run off by the end of January 2012. In March 2012, two top managers left the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://top.rbc.ru/economics/12/03/2012/641345.shtml |title=НРБ продолжают покидать высокопоставленные сотрудники :: Экономика :: РБК |website=Top.rbc.ru |date=22 December 2016 |accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2012, Lebedev announced he would close all the regional offices of the National Reserve Bank and sell off the real estate as well as 75% of the bank's loan portfolio, worth 16.8bn rubles ($542m). Also in November 2012, Lebedev announced that he is selling off his assets in Russia.&lt;ref name="Leb_BNE" /&gt;

In September 2011 while appearing on a Russian television programme, he punched a fellow guest, billionaire property developer [[Sergei Polonsky]] ([[:ru:Полонский, Сергей Юрьевич|Сергей Юрьевич Полонский]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|0UUwb9aXmVQ|''Alexandre Lebedev punches another CEO on Live Russian TV''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebedev claimed afterwards that he had reacted to Polonsky's threat of violence towards him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Siddique |first=Haroon |title=Alexander Lebedev in Russian TV punch-up |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/18/alexander-lebedev-russian-tv-punchup |accessdate=5 May 2015 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_Sergei-Polonsky_7C0B.html | work=Forbes | title=#962 Sergei Polonsky | date=5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebedev was later charged with [[hooliganism]] and sentenced to [[community service]] for that incident.&lt;ref name="Leb_BNE" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19732368|title=Russian tycoon Alexander Lebedev charged over punch-up|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==

In 2003, Lebedev stood as a candidate for elections to the Mayoralty of Moscow and the [[State Duma]]. He received 13% in the Mayoral elections, losing to [[Yuriy Luzhkov]], but won a seat in the State Duma on the [[Rodina (political party)|Rodina]] party list (he was actually number one on the Moscow regional list of the party). He remained in the Duma until 2007, when new elections were held. In the Duma, he initially moved from nationalist Rodina to the pro-Government [[United Russia]] fraction,&lt;ref name=Pers/&gt; but after Rodina was merged into the larger social-democratic coalition [[Fair Russia]], he made his return.

Lebedev was formerly the Vice Chairman of Duma's committee on the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], the coordinator of Duma's group on interactions with [[Verkhovna Rada]] of [[Ukraine]], and the coordinator of the State Duma group dealing with the city.&lt;ref name=Pers/&gt;

Lebedev, together with the former President of the [[Soviet Union]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], is the owner of 49% of ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'', one of the most vocal newspapers critical of the current Russian Government.&lt;ref name=WPNG&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/07/AR2006060701166_pf.html Peter Finn "Gorbachëv Invests in Newspaper",] ''[[Washington Post]]'', 8 June 2006, p.A17&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Anna Politkovskaya assassination|assassination]] of a prominent ''Novaya Gazeta'' journalist [[Anna Politkovskaya]], Lebedev praised in print the talents of Politkovskaya and suggested her assassins were actually trying to target the good names of her opponents.&lt;ref name=LebedevPoitkovskaya&gt;[http://2006.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2006/77n/n77n-s46.shtml Alexander Lebedev "Shooting Anna Polikovskaya They Targeted Her Opponents",] ''Novaya Gazeta'', 9 October 2006  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707140438/http://2006.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2006/77n/n77n-s46.shtml |date=7 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He pledged 25 million [[Russian ruble]]s (around US$1 million) for the information leading to the arrest of the assassins.&lt;ref name=LebedevPoitkovskaya/&gt;

Lebedev is a founder and the President of the National Investment Council, a non-political and non-government organization working to improve the investment sentiments in Russia, protecting interests of the Russian business abroad, and fighting the [[Anti-Russian sentiment|negative sentiments]] towards Russian business.&lt;ref name=Pers/&gt;

In September 2008, Russian politician [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced he was going to make a comeback to Russian politics along with Lebedev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blomfield |first=Adrian |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/3104623/Mikhail-Gorbachev-returns-to-Russian-politics.html |title=Mikhail Gorbachev returns to Russian politics |publisher=Telegraph |date=29 September 2008 |accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their party was called the [[Independent Democratic Party of Russia]].

In March 2009, Lebedev announced that he would be running for mayor of [[Sochi]], host of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/more/03/16/sochi.mayor.ap/index.html Lebedev Running For Sochi Mayor] SI.com, 16 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but a court ruling declared his candidacy invalid on 13 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/13/court-disqualifies-lebedev-sochi-mayor-race Alexander Lebedev disqualified from Sochi mayoral race] ''The Guardian'' (London), 13 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruling was a result of a complaint by another candidate, Vladimir Turukhanovsky, that Lebedev's campaign received three donations from minors that is forbidden by Russian electoral law. According to the chief of Lebedev's electoral campaign, Artyom Artyomov, the three teenagers were led to [[Sberbank]] by a staff member of the Sochi council, given 500 [[ruble]]s each (approximately $20), and told to donate the money to Lebedev's campaign. His campaigners sent the money back the same day, it was received but still it was found sufficient to disqualify his candidacy. Lebedev said that he intended to appeal the court's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1155244|script-title=ru:Александра Лебедева отослали переводом|last=Тирмастэ|first=Мария-Луиза|date=14 April 2009|work=[[Kommersant]] N66 (4121)|language=Russian|accessdate=14 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity==
Lebedev has a long history of supporting culture and charity, and created an organization named Charitable Reserve Fund (Благотворительный Резервный Фонд, BRF) to bring order to these activities. Among the organizations and projects he (or BRF) have sponsored are:&lt;ref name=Pers/&gt;

'''Antonio Marcegaglia''' (born in [[Mantua]] on 12 December 1963) is an [[Italians|Italian]] [[managing director]], Chairman and CEO of [[Marcegaglia]]; the leading industrial group in steel manufacturing.

==Biography==
Antonio Marcegaglia obtained an honours degree in business studies from Milan’s Luigi Bocconi University in 1987 and joined the [[Marcegaglia]] full-time a few days later. He forged an indissoluble bond between his personal career and the growth of this fine mid-sized Italian company of those days, later transforming it into today’s major global player.

Led by Antonio Marcegaglia, the diversification of the group was then extended with the establishment of Bioindustrie Mantovane and the acquisition of Oskar of Osteria Grande (Bologna), Nuova Omec, Ennepi of Lugo di Romagna (Ravenna) and Imat of Fontanafredda (Pordenone) in 1988 and of CCT of Gallarate (Varese) and Elet.Ca of Capalle (Florence) in 1989, as well as the foundation in 1989 of Marcegaglia Impianti of Saronno (Varese).  In the same year, Marcegaglia acquired holdings in Fergallo of Motteggiana (Mantua), SIM of Sant'Atto (Teramo) and Elletre of Montebello Vicentino (Vicenza). In 1991 the Group acquired Resco Tubi of Cusago (Milan) and OMF of Fiume Veneto (Pordenone). In 1994 it acquired Brollo Profilati of Desio (Milan), later moved to the “former Breda” area just outside Milan, on a site totalling 8 [[hectare]]s purchased in 1996, and then in 1995 ETA Euro Tubi Acciaio of Milan, followed by a stake in Allu's of Sesto al Reghena (Pordenone).

The new business and production constellation enabled the group to have a presence also in the sectors of metal household items, electrostatic paint for metals and metal components for the electrical appliance industry. Meanwhile, its metallurgical sector grew with the production of fine stainless steel tubes and cold-rolled profiles.

In 1996, the Euro Energy Group was also established in order to create plants for the production of energy from renewable sources. In January 1997 Nuova Forsidera Spa,&lt;ref&gt;Corriere della Sera [http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1997/febbraio/06/Marcegaglia_rileva_Forsidera_co_0_9702068052.shtml Marcegaglia rileva Forsidera]&lt;/ref&gt; specialising in steel cold rolling and galvanising processes, was acquired with its plants in Corsico (Milan) and Albignasego (Padua).

The group’s energy division was expanded in 1997 under the guidance of Antonio Marcegaglia with the establishment of Green Power, for the development of strategies and systems for energy generation through the gasification of waste and biomass. Further expansion came in 1998, with the creation of Boiler Expertise to design and construct the industrial and power boilers.

In that same year came the acquisition of Astra of Mezzolara, Budrio (Bologna), and the Siderplating establishment was also acquired, under the name of Marcegaglia San Giorgio of Nogaro (Udine), producing rolling mill plates.

Antonio Marcegaglia’s corporate development programme continued in 1999 with the acquisition of Morteo Nord of Pozzolo Formigaro (Alessandria),&lt;ref&gt;La Stampa [http://archivio.lastampa.it/LaStampaArchivio/main/History/tmpl_viewObj.jsp?objid=2340439 Marcegaglia: rilancio della Morteo in 3 anni] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722041446/http://archivio.lastampa.it/LaStampaArchivio/main/History/tmpl_viewObj.jsp?objid=2340439 |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ponteggi Dalmine of Milan, Graffignana (Lodi) and Potenza.

This was followed in 2001 by the acquisition, in the tourism sector, of the holiday resort of Pugnochiuso, situated on the Gargano promontory in Apulia.

In December 2001, following an investment of over 500 million euros over very few years, a large new centre of production was opened in Ravenna, the second largest iron and steel centre in Italy. And in 2002, in the former Belleli area in Taranto, its second largest production plant in the South, after the one in Potenza, entered into operation

In 2003, the sector of products for the household electrical appliance industry expanded further with the acquisition of BVB of San Lorenzo in Campo (Pesaro). While in 2004 the group took a fundamental step in the development of its activities in the tourism sector by acquiring, with Banca Intesa and the Ifil group, 49% of Sviluppo Italia Turismo

In 2007 Antonio Marcegaglia acquired the stake in Gabetti Property Solutions and upgraded the Ravenna plant with a further investment of 300 million euros. The Group continued its expansion in the energy sector where, with its subsidiary Arendi, began production of photovoltaic panels.  Likewise, its presence in tourism grew further with the acquisition of the management of Forte Village of Santa Margherita di Pula, in Sardinia, the largest hotel complex in Italy and Europe. This was followed soon after by the “Le Tonnare” holiday resort in Stintino, in the province of Sassari. In 2007 the production plant at Boltiere (Bergamo) was also enlarged. In 2008 the Group acquired the holiday location at Castel Monastero di Castelnuovo Berardenga (Siena) and the "Former Arsenale" property complex at La Maddalena (Sassari).

Since 2017, following the assignment of the Ilva Group to AM Investco (the joint-venture consisting of ArcelorMittal and [[Marcegaglia]]), Antonio Marcegaglia has been promoting the relaunch of this great European steelworks asset. The objective is to strengthen its position as a market leader and to increase the company’s market share in the European and World iron and steel works industry.

== Internationalisation of the Group ==
In 1989, Antonio Marcegaglia launched the Marcegaglia Group’s internationalisation policy which has strengthened its direct presence in the international markets.

Marcegaglia Deutschland of Düsseldorf was established in 1989 for the distribution of the Group’s own products on the German market and in Scandinavia.  United Stainless Steel was also created in the UK near London, followed by Marcegaglia U.K., for the production of welded tubes from hot and cold rolled strip, and then by Marcegaglia UK at Dudley, West Midlands.

In 1991 Antonio Marcegaglia launched the project which would see the group enter into the transatlantic markets. In the second half of the year The New Bishop Tube of Philadelphia was acquired in the US, and, in February 1992, Damascus of Greenville. Two major production units which then led to the creation of Damascus-Bishop Tube Company, specialising in the production of stainless steel.

In 1993 Antonio Marcegaglia acquired the Belgian Cotubel group, a distributor of stainless steel products and tubes in France and Benelux, and founded the trading company Central Bright Steel for the distribution of welded tubes in the UK; it also began production of these same products near Birmingham in 1997.

In the summer of 1998, a large industrial area in Munhall, near Pittsburgh, was acquired to accommodate the new Marcegaglia USA, which would also incorporate the Damascus-Bishop Tube Company.

During the same period, two other companies were formed in the United States, as subsidiaries of the parent companies in Italy: Oskar Usa in Birmingham (Alabama) and Oto Mills Usa in Wheaton (Illinois).

In 1999 Antonio Marcegaglia’s efforts led to the incorporation of Marcegaglia Iberica, Marcegaglia Ireland, Marcegaglia France, Marcegaglia Austria and Marcegaglia do Brasil, the latter tripling its turnover by 2005, extending its plant and taking the number of its employees to 1000. Meanwhile in Bremen, in joint venture with the Arbed Group, the first Marcegaglia company to produce quality steel was formed.

In 2000, the Group acquired Earcanal of Leioa, Spain. Following the joint venture with Arbed, in 2004 the Marcegaglia Group signed an agreement with the Corus group for the 10-year co-management of its British steelworks on Teesside, guaranteeing the supply at cost price of one million tonnes per year of slabs for the production of coils and sheets. Oto Mills do Brasil was founded in San Paolo in the same year.

In 2005 the Group proceeded with the expansion of Marcegaglia do Brasil, and in June Antonio Marcegaglia opened its fourth overseas production plant in Praszka (Poland), to manufacture tubes for refrigeration, panels and corrugated steel sheets. One year later, 20 kilometres away, the plant at Kluczbork was added, for the production of tubes and drawn products. Marcegaglia established Marcegaglia Gulf at Doha, Qatar in 2007. The expansion of its industrial activities continued in 2008 with its entry into China, where, in [[Yangzhou]], 350&amp;nbsp;km north-west of Shanghai,&lt;ref&gt;Agichina24 - [http://www.agichina24.it/repository/canali/norme-e-tributi/notizie/200803130200-rt2-ss20080313027aaa-art.html Marcegaglia investe a Shanghai]&lt;/ref&gt; it created its first Asian plant for the production of stainless steel tubes and high-precision carbon steel, with the establishment of Marcegaglia Romania at [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], and with the start of work on the new production plant at [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], Russia.

On June 3, 1919, Ava married [[Thomas Lister, 4th Baron Ribblesdale]] at [[St Mary's, Bryanston Square]] in [[London]] and she was known as Lady Ribblesdale.

In financial analysis, a '''channel check''' is third-party research on a company's business based on collecting information from the [[Distribution (business)|distribution channels]] of the company. It may be conducted in order to [[Valuation (finance)|value]] the company, to perform [[due diligence]] in various contexts, and the like. Industries where channel checks are more often conducted include retail, technology, commodities, etc.

It is a practice performed by third party researchers and financial analysts in order to collect information about a company’s business. The Channel Check process includes interviewing people within other organizations connected to the company’s [[supply chain|supply]] and distribution channels. These interviews usually occur without the target company’s knowledge. For example, a channel check could include one or multiple conversations with a store manager to understand their targeted customer. Analysts generally look for top products, customer buying patterns and past performance.

Analysts could also contact one or several suppliers or vendors to obtain information about the targeted company. In these interviews analysts are looking for quantity of materials being demanded and prices. Suppliers could also help Analysts to see the “Bigger Picture” of a company’s production plans, new products and more. Suppliers may also give an indication of the raw material availability, finished product inventory levels, promotion plans to the Analysts.

Channel checks can give insights complementary to [[balance sheet]] analysis, such as distributor and retailer attitudes towards a product and its competitors, [[seasonality|seasonal]] and geographic variation, [[inventory]] levels (notably [[channel stuffing]]), and so on.

National and regional competition authorities across the world have formed international support and enforcement networks.

Modern competition law has historically evolved on a country level to promote and maintain fair competition in markets principally within the territorial boundaries of [[nation-states]]. National competition law usually does not cover activity beyond territorial borders unless it has significant effects at nation-state level.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2006 1"/&gt; Countries may allow for [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]] in competition cases based on so-called effects doctrine.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2006 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JG Castel, 'The Extraterritorial Effects of Antitrust Laws' (1983) 179 Recueil des Cours 9&lt;/ref&gt; The protection of international competition is governed by international competition agreements. In 1945, during the negotiations preceding the adoption of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) in 1947, limited international competition obligations were proposed within the ''Charter for an International Trade Organisation''. These obligations were not included in GATT, but in 1994, with the conclusion of the [[Uruguay Round]] of GATT Multilateral Negotiations, the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) was created. The ''Agreement Establishing the WTO'' included a range of limited provisions on various cross-border competition issues on a sector specific basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Taylor| first = Martyn D.| title = International competition law: a new dimension for the WTO?| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| page = 2| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=wTsfwxMvz_MC&amp;dq=competition+law&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-86389-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
Competition law, or antitrust law, has three main elements:
* prohibiting agreements or practices that restrict free trading and competition between business. This includes in particular the repression of free trade caused by [[cartel]]s.
* banning abusive behavior by a firm dominating a market, or anti-competitive practices that tend to lead to such a dominant position. Practices controlled in this way may include [[predatory pricing]], [[Tying (commerce)|tying]], [[price gouging]], [[refusal to deal]], and many others.
* supervising the [[mergers and acquisitions]] of large corporations, including some [[joint venture]]s. Transactions that are considered to threaten the competitive process can be prohibited altogether, or approved subject to "remedies" such as an obligation to divest part of the merged business or to offer licenses or access to facilities to enable other businesses to continue competing.

Substance and practice of competition law varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Protecting the interests of consumers ([[welfare economics|consumer welfare]]) and ensuring that entrepreneurs have an opportunity to compete in the [[market economy]] are often treated as important objectives. Competition law is closely connected with law on deregulation of access to markets, state aids and subsidies, the [[privatization]] of state owned assets and the establishment of independent sector regulators, among other market-oriented supply-side policies. In recent decades, competition law has been viewed as a way to provide better [[public services]].&lt;ref&gt;see, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]'s [http://www.oecd.org/department/0,3355,en_2649_34753_1_1_1_1_1,00.html Regulation and Sectors] page.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bork]] argued that competition laws can produce adverse effects when they reduce competition by protecting inefficient competitors and when costs of legal intervention are greater than benefits for the consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Bork (1993), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of competition law}}

===Roman legislation===
An early example was enacted during the [[Roman Republic]] around 50&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;This is Julius Caesar's time according to Babled in ''De La Cure Annone chez le Romains''.&lt;/ref&gt; To protect the grain trade, heavy fines were imposed on anyone directly, deliberately, and insidiously stopping supply ships.&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p. 20"&gt;Wilberforce (1966) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Diocletian]] in 301 A.D., an [[Edict on Maximum Prices|edict]] imposed the death penalty for anyone violating a tariff system, for example by buying up, concealing, or contriving the scarcity of everyday goods.&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p. 20"/&gt; More legislation came under the constitution of [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] of 483 A.D., which can be traced into Florentine municipal laws of 1322 and 1325.&lt;ref&gt;Wilberforce (1966) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; This provided for confiscation of property and banishment for any trade combination or joint action of monopolies private ''or'' granted by the Emperor. Zeno rescinded all previously granted exclusive rights.&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p. 21"&gt;Wilberforce (1966) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justinian I]] subsequently introduced legislation to pay officials to manage state monopolies.&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p. 21"/&gt;

===Middle Ages===
Legislation in England to control monopolies and restrictive practices was in force well before the [[Norman Conquest]].&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p. 21"/&gt; The [[Domesday Book]] recorded that "[[Engrossing (law)|foresteel]]" (i.e. forestalling, the practice of buying up goods before they reach market and then inflating the prices) was one of three [[Asset forfeiture|forfeitures]] that [[King Edward the Confessor]] could carry out through England.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Pollock]] and [[Frederic William Maitland|Maitland]], ''History of English Law'' Vol. II, 453&lt;/ref&gt; But concern for fair prices also led to attempts to directly regulate the market. Under [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] an act was passed in 1266&lt;ref&gt;51 &amp; 52 Hen. 3, Stat. 1&lt;/ref&gt; to fix bread and ale prices in correspondence with grain prices laid down by the [[assize]]s. Penalties for breach included [[amercement]]s, [[pillory]] and [[cucking stool|tumbrel]].&lt;ref&gt;51 &amp; 52 Hen. 3, Stat. 6&lt;/ref&gt; A 14th century statute labelled forestallers as "oppressors of the poor and the community at large and enemies of the whole country".&lt;ref&gt;Wilberforce (1966) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]] the [[Statute of Labourers 1351|Statute of Labourers]] of 1349&lt;ref&gt;23 Edw. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; fixed wages of artificers and workmen and decreed that foodstuffs should be sold at reasonable prices. On top of existing penalties, the statute stated that overcharging merchants must pay the injured party double the sum he received, an idea that has been replicated in [[Punitive damages|punitive]] [[treble damages]] under [[US antitrust law]]. Also under Edward III, the following statutory provision outlawed trade combination.&lt;ref&gt;27 Edw. 3, Stat. 2, c. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;we have ordained and established, that no merchant or other shall make Confederacy, Conspiracy, Coin, Imagination, or Murmur, or Evil Device in any point that may turn to the Impeachment, Disturbance, Defeating or Decay of the said Staples, or of anything that to them pertaineth, or may pertain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In continental Europe, competition principles developed in ''[[lex mercatoria]]''. Examples of legislation enshrining competition principles include the ''constitutiones juris metallici'' by [[Wenceslaus II]] of [[Bohemia]] between 1283 and 1305, condemning combination of ore traders increasing prices; the Municipal Statutes of Florence in 1322 and 1325 followed [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]]'s legislation against state monopolies; and under [[Emperor Charles V]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] a law was passed "to prevent losses resulting from monopolies and improper contracts which many merchants and artisans made in the Netherlands". In 1553, [[Henry VIII of England]] reintroduced tariffs for foodstuffs, designed to stabilize prices, in the face of fluctuations in supply from overseas. So the legislation read here that whereas,

&lt;blockquote&gt;it is very hard and difficult to put certain prices to any such things&amp;nbsp;... [it is necessary because] prices of such victuals be many times enhanced and raised by the Greedy Covetousness and Appetites of the Owners of such Victuals, by occasion of ingrossing and regrating the same, more than upon any reasonable or just ground or cause, to the great damage and impoverishing of the King's subjects.&lt;ref&gt;25 Hen. 8, c. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Around this time organizations representing various tradesmen and handicrafts people, known as [[guild]]s had been developing, and enjoyed many concessions and exemptions from the laws against monopolies. The privileges conferred were not abolished until the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.

===Early competition law in Europe===
[[File:Edward coke.jpg|thumb|Judge [[Edward Coke|Coke]] in the 17th century thought that general restraints on trade were unreasonable.]]
The English common law of [[restraint of trade]] is the direct predecessor to modern competition law later developed in the US.&lt;ref&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;the modern common law of England [has] passed directly into the legislation and thereafter into the judge-made law of the United States." Wilberforce (1966) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the prohibition of agreements that ran counter to public policy, unless the [[Reasonable person|reasonableness]] of an agreement could be shown. It effectively prohibited agreements designed to restrain another's trade. The 1414 ''Dyer's'' is the first known restrictive trade agreement to be examined under English common law. A dyer had given a bond not to exercise his trade in the same town as the plaintiff for six months but the plaintiff had promised nothing in return. On hearing the plaintiff's attempt to enforce this restraint, Hull J exclaimed, "per Dieu, if the plaintiff were here, he should go to prison until he had paid a fine to the King". The court denied the collection of a bond for the dyer's breach of agreement because the agreement was held to be a restriction on trade.&lt;ref&gt;(1414) 2 Hen. 5, 5 Pl. 26&lt;/ref&gt; English courts subsequently decided a range of cases which gradually developed competition related case law, which eventually were transformed into [[statute law]].&lt;ref name="Papadopoulos 2010 7"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| page = 7 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth I (Armada Portrait).jpg|thumb|left|Elizabeth I assured monopolies would not be abused in the early era of [[globalization]].]]
Europe around the 16th century was changing quickly. The [[new world]] had just been opened up, overseas trade and plunder was pouring wealth through the international economy and attitudes among businessmen were shifting. In 1561 a system of Industrial Monopoly Licenses, similar to modern [[patent]]s had been introduced into England. But by the reign of [[Queen Elizabeth I]], the system was reputedly much abused and used merely to preserve privileges, encouraging nothing new in the way of innovation or manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;according to [[William Searle Holdsworth]], 4 Holdsworth, 3rd ed., Chap. 4 p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; In response English courts developed case law on restrictive business practices. The statute followed the unanimous decision in ''Darcy v. Allein'' 1602, also known as the [[Case of Monopolies]],&lt;ref&gt;(1602) 11 Co. Rep. 84b&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[King's bench]] to declare void the sole right that Queen Elizabeth I had granted to Darcy to import playing cards into England.&lt;ref name="Papadopoulos 2010 7"/&gt;  Darcy, an officer of the Queen's household, claimed damages for the defendant's infringement of this right. The court found the grant void and that three characteristics of [[monopoly]] were (1) price increases, (2) quality decrease, (3) the tendency to reduce artificers to idleness and beggary. This put an end to granted monopolies until [[James I of England|King James I]] began to grant them again. In 1623 Parliament passed the [[Statute of Monopolies]], which for the most part excluded [[patent]] rights from its prohibitions, as well as guilds. From [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], through the civil war and to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], monopolies continued, especially useful for raising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;For example one John Manley paid p.a. from 1654 to the Crown for a tender on the "postage of letters both inland and foreign" Wilberforce (1966) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1684, in ''East India Company v. Sandys'' it was decided that exclusive rights to trade only outside the realm were legitimate, on the grounds that only large and powerful concerns could trade in the conditions prevailing overseas.&lt;ref&gt;(1685) 10 St. Tr. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of early competition law in England and Europe progressed with the diffusion of writings such as ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' by [[Adam Smith]], who first established the concept of the ''[[market economy]]''. At the same time [[industrialisation]] replaced the individual [[artisan]], or group of artisans, with paid labourers and machine-based production. Commercial success increasingly dependent on maximising production while minimising cost. Therefore, the size of a company became increasingly important, and a number of European countries responded by enacting laws to regulate large companies which restricted trade. Following the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 the law of 14–17 June 1791 declared agreements by members of the same trade that fixed the price of an industry or labour as void, unconstitutional, and hostile to liberty. Similarly the Austrian Penal Code of 1852 established that "agreements ... to raise the price of a commodity ... to the disadvantage of the public should be punished as misdemeanours". Austria passed a law in 1870 abolishing the penalties, though such agreements remained void. However, in Germany laws clearly validated agreements between firms to raise prices. Throughout the 18th and 19th century, ideas that dominant private companies or legal monopolies could excessively restrict trade were further developed in Europe. However, as in the late 19th century, a depression spread through Europe, known as the [[Panic of 1873]], ideas of competition lost favour, and it was felt that companies had to co-operate by forming [[cartels]] to withstand huge pressures on prices and profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| pages =8–9 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern competition law==
While the development of competition law stalled in Europe during the late 19th century, in 1889 [[Canada]] enacted what is considered the first competition statute of modern times. The ''Act for the Prevention and Suppression of Combinations formed in restraint of Trade'' was passed one year before the United States enacted the most famous legal statute on competition law, the [[Sherman Act]] of 1890. It was named after [[Senator John Sherman]] who argued that the Act "does not announce a new principle of law, but applies old and well recognised principles of common law."&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| pages =9–10 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States antitrust===
{{Main article|United States antitrust law}}
[[File:Senatorial Round House by Thomas Nast 1886.jpg|thumb|left|Senatorial Round House by [[Thomas Nast]], 1886]]
The [[Sherman Act]] of 1890 attempted to outlaw the restriction of competition by large companies, who co-operated with rivals to fix outputs, prices and market shares, initially through ''pools'' and later through ''trusts''. Trusts first appeared in the US railroads, where the capital requirement of railroad construction precluded competitive services in then scarcely settled territories. This trust allowed railroads to discriminate on rates imposed and services provided to consumers and businesses and to destroy potential competitors. Different trusts could be dominant in different industries. The [[Standard Oil Company]] trust in the 1880s controlled a number of markets, including the market in [[fuel oil]], [[lead]] and [[whiskey]].&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; Vast numbers of citizens became sufficiently aware and publicly concerned about how the trusts negatively impacted them that the Act became a priority for both major parties. A primary concern of this act is that competitive markets themselves should provide the primary regulation of prices, outputs, interests and profits. Instead, the Act outlawed anticompetitive practices, codifying the common law restraint of trade doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| page =11 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof Rudolph Peritz has argued that competition law in the United States has evolved around two sometimes conflicting concepts of competition: first that of individual liberty, free of government intervention, and second a fair competitive environment free of excessive economic power. Since the enactment of the Sherman Act enforcement of competition law has been based on various economic theories adopted by Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| page =12 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 1 of the Sherman Act declared illegal "every contract, in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations." Section 2 prohibits [[monopolies]], or attempts and conspiracies to monopolize. Following the enactment in 1890 US court applies these principles to business and markets. Courts applied the Act without consistent economic analysis until 1914, when it was complemented by the [[Clayton Act]] which specifically prohibited exclusive dealing agreements, particularly tying agreements and interlocking directorates, and mergers achieved by purchasing stock. From 1915 onwards the ''[[rule of reason]]'' analysis was frequently applied by courts to competition cases. However, the period was characterized by the lack of competition law enforcement. From 1936 to 1972 courts' application of anti-trust law was dominated by the ''[[Industrial organization#Structure, conduct, performance|structure-conduct-performance]]'' paradigm of the Harvard School. From 1973 to 1991, the enforcement of anti-trust law was based on efficiency explanations as the Chicago School became dominant, and through legal writings such as Judge [[Robert Bork]]'s book ''[[The Antitrust Paradox]]''. Since 1992 [[game theory]] has frequently been used in anti-trust cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| pages =11–12 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union law===
{{Main article|European Union competition law}}
Competition law gained new recognition in Europe in the inter-war years, with Germany enacting its first anti-cartel law in 1923 and Sweden and Norway adopting similar laws in 1925 and 1926 respectively. However, with the [[Great Depression]] of 1929 competition law disappeared from Europe and was revived following the [[Second World War]] when the United Kingdom and Germany, following pressure from the United States, became the first European countries to adopt fully fledged competition laws. At a regional level [[EU competition law]] has its origins in the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) agreement between France, [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]] and Germany in 1951 following the Second World War. The agreement aimed to prevent Germany from re-establishing dominance in the production of [[coal]] and [[steel]] as it was felt that this dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war. Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| pages =12–13 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a [[plurilateral]] regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957 competition rules were included in the [[Treaty of Rome]], also known as the EC Treaty, which established the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC). The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the "institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted." The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position. The treaty also established principles on competition law for member states, with article 90 covering public undertakings, and article 92 making provisions on state aid. Regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| page =14 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] prohibits anti-competitive agreements in Article 101(1), including [[price fixing]]. According to Article 101(2) any such agreements are automatically void. Article 101(3) establishes exemptions, if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation, gives consumers a "fair share" of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints that risk eliminating competition anywhere (or compliant with the [[general principle of European Union law]] of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]]). Article 102 prohibits the abuse of [[dominance (economics)|dominant position]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vandenborre|first1=Ingrid|last2=Goetz|first2=Thorsten|last3=Dionnet|first3=Stephane|title=EU Nonmerger Antitrust Enforcement Gets Stricter|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/eu-nonmerger-antitrust-enforcement-gets-stricter|publisher=Transaction Advisors|ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing. Article 102 allows the [[European Council]] [[European Union regulation|regulations]] to govern mergers between firms (the current regulation is the [[European Union merger law|Regulation 139/2004/EC]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0139:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 32004R0139 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general test is whether a concentration (i.e. merger or acquisition) with a community dimension (i.e. affects a number of EU member states) might significantly impede [[effective competition]]. Articles 106 and 107 provide that member state's right to deliver public services may not be obstructed, but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies. Article 107 lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidize private parties in distortion of free competition and provides exemptions for [[charities]], regional development objectives and in the event of a [[natural disaster]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The history of competition law in India dates back to the 1960s when the first competition law, namely the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act (MRTP) was enacted in 1969. But after the economic reforms in 1991, this legislation was found to be obsolete in many aspects and as a result, a new competition law in the form of [[the Competition Act, 2002]] was enacted in 2003. The [[Competition Commission of India]], is the quasi judicial body established for enforcing provisions of the Competition Act.&lt;ref name="CCI formation"&gt;{{cite web|title=CCI formation|url=http://www.cci.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18|publisher=CCI|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International expansion===
By 2008 111 countries had enacted competition laws, which is more than 50 percent of countries with a population exceeding 80,000 people. 81 of the 111 countries had adopted their competition laws in the past 20 years, signaling the spread of competition law following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and the expansion of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Papadopoulos| first = Anestis S| title = The International Dimension of EU Competition Law and Policy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2010| page =15 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BpCqNMPNxeoC&amp;dq=eu+competition+law| isbn = 978-0-521-19646-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently [[Competition Authority (disambiguation)|competition authorities]] of many states closely co-operate, on everyday basis, with foreign counterparts in their enforcement efforts, also in such key area as information / evidence sharing.&lt;ref&gt;Marek Martyniszyn, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2436467 Inter-Agency Evidence Sharing in Competition Law Enforcement], 19(1) International Journal of Evidence and Proof 11 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WTO members and observers.svg|right|thumb|There is considerable controversy among [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] members, in green, whether competition law should form part of the agreements]]
At a national level competition law is enforced through competition authorities, as well as private enforcement. The [[United States Supreme Court]] explained:&lt;ref&gt;''Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of California'', {{ussc|405|251|1972}}, 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the free-enterprise system envisaged by Congress. This system depends on strong competition for its health and vigor, and strong competition depends, in turn, on compliance with antitrust legislation. In enacting these laws, Congress had many means at its disposal to penalize violators. It could have, for example, required violators to compensate federal, state, and local governments for the estimated damage to their respective economies caused by the violations. But, this remedy was not selected. Instead, Congress chose to permit all persons to sue to recover three times their actual damages every time they were injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[European Union]], the Modernisation Regulation 1/2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R0001:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 32003R0001 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; means that the [[European Commission]] is no longer the only body capable of public enforcement of [[European Union competition law]]. This was done to facilitate quicker resolution of competition-related inquiries. In 2005 the Commission issued a [[Green Paper]] on ''Damages actions for the breach of the EC antitrust rules'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0672:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 52005DC0672 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggested ways of making private damages claims against cartels easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/05/489&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - European Commission Green Paper on damages actions for breach of EC Treaty anti-trust rules – frequently asked questions|last=|first=|date=|website=europa.eu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some EU Member States enforce their competition laws with criminal sanctions. As analysed by [[Peter Whelan (lawyer)|Professor Whelan]], these types of sanctions engender a number of significant theoretical, legal and practical challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Peter Whelan, [http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199670062.do The Criminalization of European Cartel Enforcement: Theoretical, Legal and Practical Challenges], Oxford University Press, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Antitrust administration and legislation can be seen as a balance between:
* guidelines which are clear and specific to the courts, regulators and business but leave little room for discretion that prevents the application of laws from resulting in unintended consequences.
* guidelines which are broad, hence allowing administrators to sway between improving economic outcomes versus succumbing to political policies to redistribute wealth.&lt;ref&gt;

Chapter 5 of the post war [[Havana Charter]] contained an Antitrust code&lt;ref&gt;see a speech by Wood, ''The Internationalisation of Antitrust Law: Options for the Future'' 3 February 1995, at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/speeches/future.txt&lt;/ref&gt; but this was never incorporated into the WTO's forerunner, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] 1947. [[Office of Fair Trading]] Director and Professor Richard Whish wrote sceptically that it "seems unlikely at the current stage of its development that the WTO will metamorphose into a global competition authority."&lt;ref&gt;Whish (2003) p. 448&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, at the ongoing [[Doha round]] of trade talks for the [[World Trade Organization]], discussion includes the prospect of competition law enforcement moving up to a global level. While it is incapable of enforcement itself, the newly established [[International Competition Network]]&lt;ref&gt;see, http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (ICN) is a way for national authorities to coordinate their own enforcement activities.

==Theory==
{{Main article|Competition law theory}}

===Classical perspective===
{{See also|Classical economics}}

Under the doctrine of [[laissez-faire]], antitrust is seen as unnecessary as competition is viewed as a long-term dynamic process where firms compete against each other for market dominance. In some markets a firm may successfully dominate, but it is because of superior skill or innovativeness. However, according to laissez-faire theorists, when it tries to raise prices to take advantage of its monopoly position it creates profitable opportunities for others to compete. A process of [[creative destruction]] begins which erodes the monopoly. Therefore, government should not try to break up monopoly but should allow the market to work.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell R. McConnell, Stanley L. Brue. Economics: Principles, Problems, and Policies. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2005. pp. 601–02&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John-stuart-mill-sized.jpg|right|thumb|[[John Stuart Mill]] believed the [[restraint of trade]] doctrine was justified to preserve [[liberty]] and [[competition]].]]
The classical perspective on competition was that certain agreements and business practice could be an unreasonable restraint on the [[individual liberty]] of tradespeople to carry on their livelihoods. Restraints were judged as permissible or not by courts as new cases appeared and in the light of changing business circumstances. Hence the courts found specific categories of agreement, specific clauses, to fall foul of their doctrine on economic fairness, and they did not contrive an overarching conception of market power. Earlier theorists like Adam Smith rejected any monopoly power on this basis.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A monopoly granted either to an individual or to a trading company has the same effect as a secret in trade or manufactures. The monopolists, by keeping the market constantly under-stocked, by never fully supplying the effectual demand, sell their commodities much above the natural price, and raise their emoluments, whether they consist in wages or profit, greatly above their natural rate.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1776) Book I, Chapter 7, para 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) [[Adam Smith]] also pointed out the cartel problem, but did not advocate specific legal measures to combat them.

&lt;blockquote&gt;People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary.&lt;ref name="Book I, Chapter 10"&gt;Smith (1776) Book I, Chapter 10, para 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the latter half of the 19th century it had become clear that large firms had become a fact of the market economy. [[John Stuart Mill]]'s approach was laid down in his treatise ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Again, trade is a social act. Whoever undertakes to sell any description of goods to the public, does what affects the interest of other persons, and of society in general; and thus his conduct, in principle, comes within the jurisdiction of society... both the cheapness and the good quality of commodities are most effectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly free, under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplying themselves elsewhere. This is the so-called doctrine of Free Trade, which rests on grounds different from, though equally solid with, the principle of individual liberty asserted in this Essay. Restrictions on trade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints; and all restraint, qua restraint, is an evil...&lt;ref&gt;Mill (1859) Chapter V, para 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Neo-classical synthesis===
{{See also|Neoclassical synthesis}}
[[File:Paul Samuelson.gif|right|thumb|[[Paul Samuelson]], author of the 20th century's most successful economics text, combined mathematical models and [[Keynesian]] macroeconomic intervention. He advocated the general success of the market but backed the American government's antitrust policies.]]
After Mill, there was a shift in economic theory, which emphasized a more precise and theoretical model of competition. A simple neo-classical model of free markets holds that production and distribution of goods and services in competitive free markets maximizes [[social welfare]]. This model assumes that new firms can freely enter markets and compete with existing firms, or to use legal language, there are no [[barriers to entry]]. By this term economists mean something very specific, that competitive free markets deliver [[allocative efficiency|allocative]], [[productive efficiency|productive]] and dynamic efficiency. Allocative efficiency is also known as [[Pareto efficiency]] after the Italian economist [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and means that resources in an economy over the [[long run]] will go precisely to those who are [[Consumerism|willing]] and [[Poverty|able]] to pay for them. Because rational producers will keep producing and selling, and buyers will keep buying up to the last [[Marginalism|marginal unit]] of possible output – or alternatively rational producers will be reduce their output to the margin at which buyers will buy the same amount as produced – there is no waste, the greatest number wants of the greatest number of people become satisfied and [[Utilitarianism|utility]] is perfected because resources can no longer be reallocated to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off; society has achieved allocative efficiency. Productive efficiency simply means that society is making as much as it can. Free markets are meant to reward those who [[Protestant work ethic|work hard]], and therefore those who will put society's resources towards the [[Production possibility frontier|frontier of its possible production]].&lt;ref&gt;for one of the opposite views, see [[Kenneth Galbraith]], ''[[The New Industrial State]]'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic efficiency refers to the idea that business which constantly competes must research, create and innovate to keep its share of consumers. This traces to Austrian-American political scientist [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s notion that a "perennial gale of creative destruction" is ever sweeping through [[capitalism|capitalist]] economies, driving enterprise at the market's mercy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Schumpeter]], ''The Process of Creative Destruction'' (1942)&lt;/ref&gt; This led Schumpeter to argue that monopolies did not need to be broken up (as with [[Standard Oil]]) because the next gale of economic innovation would do the same.

Contrasting with the allocatively, productively and dynamically efficient market model are monopolies, oligopolies, and cartels. When only one or a few firms exist in the market, and there is no credible threat of the entry of competing firms, prices rise above the competitive level, to either a monopolistic or oligopolistic equilibrium price. Production is also decreased, further decreasing [[social welfare]] by creating a [[deadweight loss]]. Sources of this market power are said{{By whom|date=October 2009}} to include the existence of [[externalities]], [[barriers to entry]] of the market, and the [[free rider problem]]. Markets may [[market failure|fail]] to be efficient for a variety of reasons, so the exception of competition law's intervention to the rule of ''[[laissez faire]]'' is justified if [[government failure]] can be avoided. Orthodox economists fully acknowledge that [[perfect competition]] is seldom observed in the real world, and so aim for what is called "[[workable competition]]."&lt;ref&gt;Whish (2003), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=John M. |year=1940 |month= |title=Towards a Concept of Workable Competition |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=241–56 |jstor=1807048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This follows the theory that if one cannot achieve the ideal, then go for the second best option&lt;ref&gt;c.f. {{cite journal |last=Lipsey |first=R.

===Chicago School===
[[File:Robert Bork.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Bork]]]]
{{See also|Chicago school of economics|Neoclassical economics}}
A group of economists and lawyers, who are largely associated with the [[University of Chicago]], advocate an approach to competition law guided by the proposition that some actions that were originally considered to be anticompetitive could actually promote competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hovenkamp |first=Herbert |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1985 |month= |title=Antitrust Policy after Chicago |journal=Michigan Law Review |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=213–84 |doi=10.2307/1289065|publisher=The Michigan Law Review Association |jstor=1289065}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] has used the Chicago School approach in several recent cases.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.]]'', {{ussc|433|36|1977}}; ''[[Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|441|1|1979}}; ''[[National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v.

Trinko]]'', {{ussc|540|398|2004}}; ''[[Leegin Creative Leather Products Inc. v. PSKS Inc.]]'', 551 U.S. ___ (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; One view of the Chicago School approach to antitrust is found in United States Circuit Court of Appeals Judge [[Richard Posner]]'s books ''Antitrust Law''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Antitrust Law |last=Posner |first=R. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |edition=2nd |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-67576-9 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Economic Analysis of Law''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Economic Analysis of Law |last=Posner |first=R. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |edition=7th |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business |location=Austin, TX |isbn=978-0-7355-6354-4 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Bork]] was highly critical of court decisions on United States antitrust law in a series of law review articles and his book ''[[The Antitrust Paradox]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Antitrust Paradox |last=Bork |first=Robert H. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1978 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |isbn=0-465-00369-9 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bork argued that both the original intention of antitrust laws and economic efficiency was the pursuit ''only'' of consumer welfare, the protection of competition rather than competitors.&lt;ref name="Bork1978p405"&gt;Bork (1978), p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, only a few acts should be prohibited, namely cartels that fix prices and divide markets, mergers that create monopolies, and dominant firms pricing predatorily, while allowing such practices as vertical agreements and price discrimination on the grounds that it did not harm consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Bork (1978), p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; Running through the different critiques of US antitrust policy is the common theme that government interference in the operation of free markets does more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Easterbrook |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Easterbrook |coauthors= |year=1984 |month= |title=The Limits of Antitrust |journal=Texas Law Review |volume=63 |issue= |page=1 |issn=0040-4411 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The only cure for bad theory," writes Bork, "is better theory."&lt;ref name="Bork1978p405" /&gt; The late [[Harvard Law School]] Professor [[Philip Areeda]], who favours more aggressive antitrust policy, in at least one Supreme Court case challenged Robert Bork's preference for non-intervention.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brooke Group v.

===Collusion and cartels===
{{Main article|Collusion|Cartel}}
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|right|thumb|[[Scottish Enlightenment]] philosopher [[Adam Smith]] was an early enemy of cartels.]]

===Dominance and monopoly===
{{Main article|Dominance (economics)|Monopoly}}
[[File:Monopoly-surpluses.svg|thumb|right|The economist's depiction of [[deadweight loss]] to efficiency that monopolies cause]]
When firms hold large market shares, consumers risk paying higher prices and getting lower quality products than compared to competitive markets. However, the existence of a very high market share does not always mean consumers are paying excessive prices since the threat of new entrants to the market can restrain a high-market-share firm's price increases. Competition law does not make merely having a monopoly illegal, but rather abusing the power that a monopoly may confer, for instance through exclusionary practices.

First it is necessary to determine whether a firm is dominant, or whether it behaves "to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors, customers and ultimately of its consumer."&lt;ref&gt;C-27/76 ''United Brands Continental BV v. Commission'' [1978] ECR 207&lt;/ref&gt; Under EU law, very large market shares raise a presumption that a firm is dominant,&lt;ref&gt;C-85/76 ''Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co AG v. Commission'' [1979] ECR 461&lt;/ref&gt; which may be rebuttable.&lt;ref&gt;''AKZO'' [1991]&lt;/ref&gt; If a firm has a dominant position, then there is "a special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair competition on the common market."&lt;ref&gt;''Michelin'' [1983]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly as with collusive conduct, market shares are determined with reference to the particular market in which the firm and product in question is sold. Then although the lists are seldom closed,&lt;ref&gt;''Continental Can'' [1973]&lt;/ref&gt; certain categories of abusive conduct are usually prohibited under the country's legislation. For instance, limiting production at a shipping port by refusing to raise expenditure and update technology could be abusive.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 82 (b) ''Porto di Genova'' [1991]&lt;/ref&gt; Tying one product into the sale of another can be considered abuse too, being restrictive of consumer choice and depriving competitors of outlets. This was the alleged case in ''Microsoft v. Commission''&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62004B0201(02):EN:NOT Case T-201/04] ''Microsoft v. Commission'' Order, 22 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; leading to an eventual fine of  million for including its [[Windows Media Player]] with the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform. A refusal to supply a facility which is essential for all businesses attempting to compete to use can constitute an abuse. One example was in a case involving a medical company named ''[[Commercial Solvents]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Commercial Solvents]]'' [1974]&lt;/ref&gt; When it set up its own rival in the [[tuberculosis]] drugs market, Commercial Solvents were forced to continue supplying a company named Zoja with the raw materials for the drug. Zoja was the only market competitor, so without the court forcing supply, all competition would have been eliminated.

Forms of abuse relating directly to pricing include price exploitation. It is difficult to prove at what point a dominant firm's prices become "exploitative" and this category of abuse is rarely found. In one case however, a French funeral service was found to have demanded exploitative prices, and this was justified on the basis that prices of funeral services outside the region could be compared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;numdoc=61987J0030&amp;lg=en C-30/87] ''Corinne Bodson v. SA Pompes funèbres des régions libérées'' [1987] ECR 2479&lt;/ref&gt; A more tricky issue is [[predatory pricing]]. This is the practice of dropping prices of a product so much that one's smaller competitors cannot cover their costs and fall out of business. The [[Chicago School (economics)]] considers predatory pricing to be unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g. Posner (1998) p. 332; "While it is possible to imagine cases in which predatory pricing would be a rational stragy, it should be apparent by now why confirmed cases of it are rare."&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''France Telecom SA v. Commission''&lt;ref&gt;Case T-340/03 ''France Telecom SA v. Commission''&lt;/ref&gt; a broadband internet company was forced to pay $13.9 million for dropping its prices below its own production costs. It had "no interest in applying such prices except that of eliminating competitors"&lt;ref&gt;''AKZO'' [1991] para 71&lt;/ref&gt; and was being cross-subsidized to capture the lion's share of a booming market. One last category of pricing abuse is [[price discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;in the EU under Article 82(2)c)&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this could be offering rebates to industrial customers who export your company's sugar, but not to customers who are selling their goods in the same market as you are in.&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Sugar'' [1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mergers and acquisitions===
{{Main article|Mergers and acquisitions}}
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Aoltw.jpg|thumb|The world's biggest ever [[merger]], valued at $165,747,000,000 was between [[AOL]] and [[Time Warner]] in 2000]] --&gt;
A merger or acquisition involves, from a competition law perspective, the concentration of economic power in the hands of fewer than before.&lt;ref&gt;Under EC law, a concentration is where a "change of control on a lasting basis results from (a) the merger of two or more previously independent undertakings... (b) the acquisition... if direct or indirect control of the whole or parts of one or more other undertakings." Art. 3(1), Regulation 139/2004, the [[European Community Merger Regulation]]&lt;/ref&gt; This usually means that one firm buys out the [[share (finance)|shares]] of another. The reasons for oversight of economic concentrations by the state are the same as the reasons to restrict firms who abuse a position of dominance, only that regulation of mergers and acquisitions attempts to deal with the problem before it arises, ''ex ante'' prevention of market dominance.&lt;ref&gt;In the case of [T-102/96] ''Gencor Ltd v. Commission'' [1999] ECR II-753 the EU [[Court of First Instance]] wrote merger control is there "to avoid the establishment of market structures which may create or strengthen a dominant position and not need to control directly possible abuses of dominant positions"&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States merger regulation began under the Clayton Act, and in the European Union, under the Merger Regulation 139/2004 (known as the "ECMR").&lt;ref&gt;The authority for the Commission to pass this regulation is found under Art. 83 TEC&lt;/ref&gt; Competition law requires that firms proposing to merge gain authorization from the relevant government authority. The theory behind mergers is that transaction costs can be reduced compared to operating on an open market through bilateral contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coase |first=Ronald H.|authorlink=Ronald H. Coase |date=November 1937 |title=The Nature of the Firm |journal=Economica |volume=4 |issue=16|pages=386–405 |url=http://www.cerna.ensmp.fr/Enseignement/CoursEcoIndus/SupportsdeCours/COASE.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-02-10 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070113063048/http://www.cerna.ensmp.fr/Enseignement/CoursEcoIndus/SupportsdeCours/COASE.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 13 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations can increase [[economies of scale]] and scope. However often firms take advantage of their increase in market power, their increased market share and decreased number of competitors, which can adversely affect the deal that consumers get. Merger control is about predicting what the market might be like, not knowing and making a judgment. Hence the central provision under EU law asks whether a concentration ''would'', if it went ahead, "significantly impede effective competition... in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening off a dominant position..."&lt;ref&gt;Art. 2(3) Reg. 129/2005&lt;/ref&gt; and the corresponding provision under US antitrust states similarly,

&lt;blockquote&gt;No person shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital... of the assets of one or more persons engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce, where... the effect of such acquisition, of such stocks or assets, or of the use of such stock by the voting or granting of proxies or otherwise, may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton Act Section 7, codified at {{usc|15|18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What amounts to a substantial lessening of, or significant impediment to competition is usually answered through empirical study. The market shares of the merging companies can be assessed and added, although this kind of analysis only gives rise to presumptions, not conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;see, for instance para 17, ''Guidelines on the assessment of horizontal mergers'' (2004/C 31/03)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Herfindahl index|Herfindahl-Hirschman Index]] is used to calculate the "density" of the market, or what concentration exists. Aside from the maths, it is important to consider the product in question and the rate of technical innovation in the market.&lt;ref&gt;C-68/94 ''France v. Commission'' [1998] ECR I-1375, para. 219&lt;/ref&gt; A further problem of collective dominance, or [[oligopoly]] through "economic links"&lt;ref&gt;''Italian Flat Glass'' [1992] ECR ii-1403&lt;/ref&gt; can arise, whereby the new market becomes more conducive to [[collusion]]. It is relevant how transparent a market is, because a more concentrated structure could mean firms can coordinate their behavior more easily, whether firms can deploy deterrents and whether firms are safe from a reaction by their competitors and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;T-342/99 ''Airtours plc v. Commission'' [2002] ECR II-2585, para 62&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of new firms to the market, and any barriers that they might encounter should be considered.&lt;ref&gt;''Mannesmann, Vallourec and Ilva'' [1994] CMLR 529, OJ L102 21 April 1994&lt;/ref&gt; If firms are shown to be creating an uncompetitive concentration, in the US they can still argue that they create efficiencies enough to outweigh any detriment, and similar reference to "technical and economic progress" is mentioned in Art. 2 of the ECMR.&lt;ref&gt;see the argument put forth in Hovenkamp H (1999) ''Federal Antitrust Policy: The Law of Competition and Its Practice'', 2nd Ed, West Group, St. Paul, Minnesota. Unlike the authorities however, the courts take a dim view of the efficiencies defense.&lt;/ref&gt; Another defense might be that a firm which is being taken over is about to fail or go insolvent, and taking it over leaves a no less competitive state than what would happen anyway.&lt;ref&gt;''Kali und Salz AG v. Commission'' [1975] ECR 499&lt;/ref&gt; Mergers vertically in the market are rarely of concern, although in ''AOL/Time Warner''&lt;ref&gt;''Time Warner/AOL'' [2002] 4 CMLR 454, OJ L268&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Commission]] required that a joint venture with a competitor [[Bertelsmann]] be ceased beforehand. The EU authorities have also focused lately on the effect of [[conglomerate merger]]s, where companies acquire a large portfolio of related products, though without necessarily dominant shares in any individual market.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Guinness/Grand Metropolitan'' [1997] 5 CMLR 760, OJ L288; Many in the US disapprove of this approach, see W. J. Kolasky, ''Conglomerate Mergers and Range Effects: It's a long way from Chicago to Brussels'' 9 November 2001, Address before George Mason University Symposium Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual property, innovation and competition===
Competition law has become increasingly intertwined with [[intellectual property]], such as [[copyright]], [[trademark]]s, [[patent]]s, [[industrial design right]]s and in some jurisdictions [[trade secret]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/hearings/ip/222655.pdf |title=Antitrust Enforcement and Intellectual Property Rights: Promoting Innovation and Competition |date=April 2007 |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that promotion of [[innovation]] through enforcement of intellectual property rights may promote as well as limit competitiveness. The question rests on whether it is legal to acquire monopoly through accumulation of intellectual property rights. In which case, the judgment needs to decide between giving preference to intellectual property rights or to competitiveness:
* Should antitrust laws accord special treatment to intellectual property.
* Should intellectual rights be revoked or not granted when antitrust laws are violated.

Concerns also arise over anti-competitive effects and consequences due to:
* Intellectual properties that are collaboratively designed with consequence of violating antitrust laws (intentionally or otherwise).
* The further effects on competition when such properties are accepted into industry standards.
* Cross-licensing of intellectual property.
* Bundling of intellectual property rights to long term business transactions or agreements to extend the market exclusiveness of intellectual property rights beyond their statutory duration.
* [[Trade secrets]], if they remain a secret, having an eternal length of life.

Some scholars suggest that a prize instead of patent would solve the problem of deadweight loss, when innovators got their reward from the prize, provided by the government or non-profit organization, rather than directly selling to the market, see [[Millennium Prize Problems]]. However innovators may accept the prize only when it is at least as much as how much they earn from patent, which is a question difficult to determine.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Scotchmer: "Innovation and Incentives" the MIT press, 2004 (Chapter 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12899">'''Industrial dynamics''' is the study of the means and processes through which industries change over time, through their own processes of evolution – as first analyzed by [[Joseph Schumpeter]].  It is the complementary study to that of an industry’s comparative statics, which still dominates economic analysis.  Industrial dynamics, as studied by scholars such as Carlsson and Eliasson,&lt;ref&gt;Carlsson, B. 1997. Technological systems and industrial dynamics. Springer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlsson, B. and G. Eliasson 2003. Industrial dynamics and endogenous growth, Industry and Innovation, 10 (4): 435-455.&lt;/ref&gt; reveal the basic underlying forces driving industry evolution.  Some industries, particularly those with rapid product turnover or high levels of capital expenditure, reveal special dynamics moving through intrinsic upturns and downturns that are not necessarily related to the wider economic fluctuations.  These are known as '''cyclical industrial dynamics'''. They have recently come under investigation in the specialized literature.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, H., &amp; Mathews, J. A. In Press.{{Update after|2018|3}} Identification and analysis of industry cycles.  Journal of Business Research. {{doi|10.1016/j.jbusres.2009.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tan, H., &amp; Mathews, J. A. In Press.{{Update after|2018|3}}  Cyclical Industrial Dynamics: The case of the global semiconductor industry. Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change. {{doi|10.1016/j.techfore.2009.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence of industry cycles==
Almost all industries exhibit cyclicality to some extent. Below are some examples where industry cycles have been particularly examined.

===Commodities===
The research by [[John Sterman]] finds that the so-called commodity cycles arise in many commodity markets.&lt;ref&gt;Sterman, John D. 2000. Business Dynamics. Boston: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, price and production cycles in markets of hog, cattle and copper span 4 years, 10–12 years and 8–10 years each in average respectively. Margret Slade estimates that cycles in prices of metals including aluminum, copper, iron, lead, silver, tin, and zinc are about 10–14 years in duration, which is twice as long as the investment periods.&lt;ref&gt;Slade, Margret E. 1982. Cycles in Natural-Resource Commodity Prices: An Analysis of the Frequency Domain. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management 9:138-148.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study by Thomas Stanback indicates a persistent cycle of approximately two years duration in the textile industry in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Stanback, Thomas M. 1958. The textile cycle: Characteristics and contributing factors. Southern Economic Journal 25 (2):174-188.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alajoutsijärvi and colleagues report that the cycle in the German paper industry has shortened in duration since 1990, and is now about two or three years in length.&lt;ref&gt;Alajoutsijärvi, K., M. B. Klint, and H. Tikkanen. 2001. Customer Relationship Strategies and the Smoothing of Industry-Specific Business Cycles: The Case of the Global Fine Paper Industry. Industrial Marketing Management 30:487-497&lt;/ref&gt;

===Durable goods===
Based on his observations of the explicit cyclical movement in the shipbuilding industry, Nobel Prize-winning economist [[Jan Tinbergen]] believes the so-called ‘durable goods cycle’ is a result of the lag of the upstream industries such as shipbuilding in response to the cycles in end users markets such as that in freight rates.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, Jan, and J. J. Polak. 1950. The dynamics of business cycles : a study in economic fluctuations. London: Routledge &amp; K. Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;  He further suggests that the cycle length of the upstream industry is four times the lag, and is about 17 years in the shipbuilding industry.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, J. 1981. Kondratiev cycles and so-called long waves: The early research. Futures 13 (4):258-263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides the traditional industries, many new industries such as semiconductors, flat panel displays, computers and telecommunications also exhibit strong cyclicality.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Noam, E. M. 2006. Fundamental instability: Why telecom is becoming a cyclical and oligopolistic industry. Information Economics and Policy 18:272-284; 2005. Liu, W.-H. Determinants of the semiconductor industry cycles. Journal of Policy Modeling 27:853-866; Mathews, J. A. 2005. Strategy and the Crystal Cycle. California Management Review 47 (2):6-32; McClean, B. 2001. 2001 IC industry at the crossroads. Semiconductor International 24 (1):73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Services===
In the service sector, for example, Choi and colleagues date the industry cycles of the US hotel industry and restaurant industry.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, J.-G. 1999. The Restaurant Industry: Business Cycles, Strategic Financial Practices, Economic Indicators, and Forecasting. Doctoral Dissertation, Department of Hospitality and Tourism Management, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia; and Choi, J.-G., M. D. Olsen, F. A. Kwansa, and E. C.-Y. Tse. 1999. Forecasting industry turning points: the US hotel industry cycle model. Hospitality Management 18:159-170.&lt;/ref&gt;  They establish the mean duration of the business cycle, measured with aggregate activities in absolute level, as about 7.3 years for the U.S. hotel industry; and for the U.S. restaurant industry, as about 8 years.

==Industry cycles versus business cycles==
Cyclical dynamics at the level of individual industries may present rather different patterns from those of the general business cycles. For example, while the fluctuations of many industries correlate with those in the aggregate economy, there were also many industries that are not sensitive to business cycles — such as the pharmaceutical, educational service, insurance carriers and public service industries; some other industries such as the health service industry even enjoy higher growth during recessions.&lt;ref&gt;Berman J, Pfleeger J. 1997. Which industries are sensitive to business cycles. Monthly Labor Review 120(2): 19-26&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, it was estimated that "in any one recession [during the 1980s and the 1990s] only 60% of all industrial sectors were actually in a downturn."&lt;ref&gt;‘How was it for you?’ The Economist, 2001, Vol. 362: 4-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The timing, duration and amplitude of industry cycles can vary widely. Durable goods industries in the US are approximately three times more cyclical than nondurable-goods industries.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, B., and S. Strongin. 1996. Why are some industries more cyclical than others? Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics 14 (2):189-198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification and measurement of industry cycles==
Industry cycles have been identified using either the ‘classical cycle’ approach or the ‘growth cycle’ approach. The former approach uses time series in levels of economic activities to define cycles; and only absolute decline in the activities qualifies as a ‘downturn’.&lt;ref&gt;Zarnowitz, V., and A. Ozyildirim. 2002. Time series decomposition and measurement of business cycles, trend and growth cycles. In NBER Working Paper 8736. Cambridge, Massachusetts: National Bureau of Economic Research&lt;/ref&gt;

While this approach is consistent with the approach used by the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER) to identify business cycles in the US, cycles at the industry level are usually concealed by strong industry trends which dominate industrial series. Therefore industry cycles are more commonly identified using the ‘growth cycle’ approach, by separating the cyclical component of a time series from the underlying trend.

Combining the growth cycle approach and other econometric techniques such as the [[Hodrick-Prescott filter]], the industry cycles in the global semiconductor, PCs and flat panel display industries in the past decades are identified.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Hao 2007. Cyclical Industrial Dynamics: Identification and Analysis of Cyclical Bebaviour in Three IT Industries. Doctoral Dissertation, Macquarie Graduate School of Management, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry cycles can be further measured using techniques such as the [[Fourier analysis]]. For example, three most powerful cycles of the global semiconductor shipment data in the frequency domain are identified, with an average period of 4 years, 2.29 years, and 1.03 years accordingly (reverting to the original time domain).&lt;ref&gt;Tan, H., &amp; Mathews, J. A. In Press. Identification and analysis of industry cycles.Journal of Business Research. {{doi|10.1016/j.jbusres.2009.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drivers of industry cycles==
Three main mechanisms are suggested to be responsible for industry cycles, namely industry cycles caused by business cycles; industry cycles caused by mismatch and delay between different market dynamics including investment, capacity, price and sales; and industry cycles caused by the dynamics of innovation.

Many industries boom when the aggregate economy is prosperous and bust when the economy is in recession. In other words, industry cycles of many industries in a given country are correlated with the business cycles of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Kandil, M. 1997. What differentiates industrial business cycles? A cross-country investigation. Applied Economics 29:197-212.&lt;/ref&gt;  For other industries, mismatch and delay between different dynamics in markets is another important mechanism causing industry cycles. The [[Bullwhip effect]] at firm-level &lt;ref&gt;See Forrester, J. W. 1961. Industrial Dynamics. MIT Press; and Senge, P. M. 1990. The Fifth Discipline. The Art &amp; Practise of The Learning Organization. London: Century Business&lt;/ref&gt; and game-like competition at industry-level &lt;ref&gt;See theory at Tirole, J. 1988. The theory of industrial organization. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press; see applications at, for example, Dearden, J. A., G. L. Lilien, and E. Yoon. 1999. Marketing and production capacity strategy for non-differentiated products: Winning and losing at the capacity cycle game. International Journal of Research in Marketing 16:57-74&lt;/ref&gt; can cause the sequential boom-bust movement in price, sales, capacity and investment in many industries. Finally, uneven pace of technology change appears to be another main driver of industry cycles as sales in an industry are likely to peak after a ‘dominant design’ has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;see Anderson, P., and [[M. L. Tushman]]. 1990. Technological discontinuities and dominant designs: A cyclical model of technological change. Administrative Science Quarterly 35:604-633; and [[Tushman, M. L.]], and P. Anderson. 1986. Technological discontinuities and organizational environments. Administrative Science Quarterly 31 (3):439-465.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic implications of industry cycles==
Some industrial dynamics can be better understood through the lens of industry cycles. For example, it has been found that industries become more concentrated during the industry cycle downturns.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, H., &amp; Mathews, J. A. In Press. Cyclical Industrial Dynamics: The case of the global semiconductor industry. Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change. {{doi|10.1016/j.techfore.2009.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon is consistent with the theory of [[Joseph Schumpeter]] which views downturns as providing a mechanism of ‘cleansing’ which allocates the resources to stronger competitors in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, J. A. 1939. Business Cycles: A theoretical, historical and Statistical Analysis of the Capitalist Process. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyclical industrial dynamics constitute a key strategic setting for firms and thus bring many important implications to strategy-making of firms. For example, in the highly cyclical oil-well drilling industry, it has been suggested that, first, companies did adjust their strategic activities such as capital expenditure and asset allocation according to the stage of the cycle, and second, ‘optimal’ strategies varied across cycle stages.&lt;ref&gt;Mascarenhas, B., and D. A. Aaker. 1989. Strategy over the business cycle. Strategic Management Journal 10:199-210.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the highly cyclical flat panel display industry, where there have been five upturns and downturns since the industry began in 1990, John Mathews demonstrated that there is a striking pattern in firms’ entry behavior, where not a single successful entry was engineered during an industry upturn.&lt;ref&gt;Mathews, J. A. 2005. Strategy and the Crystal Cycle. California Management Review 47 (2):6-32.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the marketing literature, the pattern where firms are found to utilize recessions as times to enhance the standing of their brand, has also been noted.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Srinivasan R, Rangaswamy A, Lilien GL. 2005. Turning adversity into advantage: Does proactive marketing during a recession pay off? International Journal of Research in Marketing 22: 109-125&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[member states of the European Union]] are bound to decrease their [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. For example, the EU [[climate and energy]] package requires member states to improve their energy efficiency by 20%, increase -renewable energy production by 20% and reduce their emissions by 20%. With about 40% of CO2 emissions heating, cooling and hot water production in buildings is one of the largest greenhouse gas producers.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Norbert. Heating, cooling, lighting: Sustainable design methods for architects. John wiley &amp; sons, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the building sector has the largest potential for energy savings. In their effort to lead a change towards greater energy efficiency and a reduction of greenhouse gas, many companies, cities and municipalities are in the process of developing [[low carbon]] action plans.&lt;ref&gt;Baeumler, Axel, Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez, and Shomik Mehndiratta, eds.

Global Environmental Change 23.1 (2013): 92-102.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the costs for developing optimal action plans and their continuous monitoring and optimization are very high, thus, often hindered by the tense financial situation, especially of cities and municipalities. With significant economic and environmental downsides; the consequences are additional costs due to the non-compliance to the national and EU emission goals and untapped energy saving potential.

ECOCITIES is an energy optimization system for building portfolios combining and extending the benefits of [[Energy Management Software]] (EMS), [[Computer-aided facility management|Computer-aided Facility Management]] (CAFM) software and building portfolio management software. It integrates building administration and monitoring, energy accounting and building portfolio optimization. Thereby, it supports the definition of low carbon action plans in terms of environmental impact (e.g., [[carbon footprint]], [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]) and financial impact (e.g., investment costs, running, costs). The system considers the following options for each building and the resulting (inter-) dependencies:
* energy-efficient building configurations (e.g., the compatibility of building components and its contribution to the energy efficiency level), 
* energy used at the production and distribution of building components (i.e., gray energy),
* [[environmental impact]] (e.g., [[CO2 emissions]]),
* financial constraints, such as (governmental) funding and limited long term loans,
* legal constraints, e.g., [[building codes]], national and international standards,
* energy consumption for the operation of buildings, i.e., heating, ventilation, and air conditioning ([[HVAC]]) as well as the electricity demand,
* energy production, storage and load shifting between buildings in combination with [[renewable energy production]] ([[solar PV]] and thermal, [[Micro combined heat and power]]) and conversion.
* energy flows between a building’s on-site networks (Heating/Cooling and low voltage networks), the micro networks on neighborhood level and the city-wide energy networks ([[district heating]] and [[district cooling]] networks, mid-voltage distribution networks), 
* local typology (position of buildings, energy networks).

ECOCITIES calculates all energy- and cost-efficient development scenarios, visualizes them on the screen and allows decision makers to interactively explore the consequences of their actions (e.g., what are the citywide costs and the corresponding CO2 reductions of introducing a neighborhood-scale combined heat and power plant). ECOCITIES is an enabler for the realization of energy goals and provides synergies with existing endeavors of achieving national and European energy goals. On an operational level, ECOCITIES supports the following processes:
* Administration and integrated optimization of the entire building portfolio.
* Energy accounting and monitoring for all buildings.
* Identification, evaluation and definition of energy efficiency strategies (low carbon action plans).
* Continuous monitoring, review and optimization of energy efficiency strategies (low carbon action plans).
* Ensure the alignment of individual initiatives with the overall energy strategy of the company/city, e.g., planning the cost- and energy efficient integration of new or refurbished single buildings, groups of buildings or entire neighborhoods into a new or existing energy efficiency strategy.
* Continuous monitoring of the performance related to the contribution to national and European energy goals.

An '''enrober''' is a machine used in the [[confectionery]] industry to coat a food item with a coating medium, typically [[chocolate]]. Foods that are coated by enrobers include nuts, ice cream, toffee, [[biscuit]]s and [[cookie]]s. Enrobing with chocolate extends a confection's [[shelf life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Yiu H.

The process of enrobing involves placing the items on the enrober's feed band, which may consist of a wire mesh or containers in which the confection to be enrobed are placed, with each container having drain holes to recover excess chocolate. The enrober maintains the coating medium at a controlled constant temperature and pumps the medium into a flow pan. The medium flows from the flow pan in a continuous curtain and bottoming bed that the food items pass through, completely coating them. A wire mesh conveyor belt then transports the coated confection to a cooling area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=MD Ranken |author2=RC Kill |title=Food Industries Manual |publisher=Springer |year=1997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iG3wx9Wh5N4C&amp;pg=PA439 |page=439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eric Magnus Campbell Tigerstedt''' (August 14, 1887 &amp;ndash; April 20, 1925) was one of the most significant inventors in Finland at the beginning of the 20th century and has been called the "[[Thomas Edison]] of Finland". He was a pioneer of [[sound film|sound-on-film]] technology and made significant improvements to the amplification capacity of the [[vacuum tube|vacuum valve]]. Having seen a showing of the [[Lumière brothers]]' new motion picture technology as a 9-year-old boy in Helsinki in 1896, he was inspired to bring sound to silent pictures.

Many years later, in 1914, his demonstration film ''Word and Picture'' was presented to a gathering of scientific dignitaries in [[Berlin]], but his invention was never commercialised. In addition to improving the triode vacuum valve, he developed directional loudspeakers. Tigerstedt also predicted such future inventions as television and the mobile phone, and in 1917 he filed a patent for what he described as a "pocket-size folding telephone with a very thin carbon microphone". Tigerstedt was awarded a total of 71 patents in several countries between the years 1912 and 1924.

== Life ==

===Early interest in technology===
Tigerstedt was born in [[Helsinki]] and started to show a particular interest in all things technical at an early age. He studied his father’s scientific books with great interest, and at age 11 he built a simple [[photographic]] device. At age 13, he began experimenting with other technical devices and machines, and he built his own version of an [[electric motor]] and electrical [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]]. After a falling out with his father, he left home at the age of 15, supporting himself by working as a handyman and [[technician]] in mechanical workshops and shipyards in Helsinki. He later worked as a technician in the [[telephone]] industry, which was rapidly becoming a major business in Helsinki at that time.

===Studies in Germany===
In 1908, Tigerstedt moved to Germany to continue his studies. He completed his high school education and began studies in [[electrical engineering]] at the [[Friedrichs Polytechnikum]] in [[Köthen (Anhalt)|Köthen]]. After completing his studies there in 1911, he moved back to Finland with his fiancée Marjatta Nybom, whom he had met and fallen in love with while in Köthen. She had been studying the violin in Switzerland and met Tigersted through her brother Albert Nybom, who was also studying in Köthen and was a classmate of Tigerstedt. However, the engagement between Tigerstedt and Marjatta Nybom was broken off in 1912.

===Sound-on-film prototype===
After returning to Finland, he continued his experiments and succeeded in building a prototype of [[sound-on-film]] technology ("talking movies"). Tigerstedt then returned to Germany in 1913 and founded a company with the Swedish merchant [[Axel Wahlstedt]] and the Swedish engineer [[Hugo Swartling]]. This was the first in a series of unsuccessful business ventures. Although Tigerstedt was able to complete his work with the sound-on-film technology, the partners' [[laboratory]] was eventually confiscated due to unpaid rent. They managed to reclaim their laboratory, but it was then destroyed in a fire. The cooperation between Wahlstedt and Tigerstedt became strained and in January 1914 they dissolved their company. After breaking off their commercial partnership, Wahlstedt returned to Sweden, while Tigerstedt stayed behind in Berlin, more or less broke.

===Demonstration of sound-on-film===
Tigerstedt continued working on his sound-on-film technology and made progress in solving a major technical problem, that of how to amplify film audio sufficiently to fill a large theatre or hall. He did this by making major improvements to the vacuum tube design of [[Lee de Forest]], increasing the [[amplifier|amplification]] capacity substantially. In February–March 1914, Tigerstedt demonstrated his sound-on-film technology to a small group of scientists, using his own film ''Word and Picture''.

===1914-1917===
After being expelled from Germany in July 1914, Tigerstedt returned to Finland, but he moved to [[Sweden]] a few months later and then to [[Denmark]] in 1915. After another unsuccessful business venture, Tigerstedt once more returned to Finland. In 1917, he moved back to Denmark and founded yet another company, which was then sold. After that, he participated in the founding of the Norwegian company A/S Anod, in which he held a 45% stake.

===Finnish Civil War of 1918===
As a Finnish citizen, Tigerstedt was called back to take part in the [[Finnish civil war]] of 1918, and on 14 February 1918 he was on his way back to Finland. After the cessation of hostilities, he participated in the victory parade on 16 May 1918, but then returned to Denmark, where he married Ingrid Lignell in 1919. Their son Carl Axel Waldemar was born in 1921. However, their marriage soon began to deteriorate, and they separated not long after the birth of their son.

===Loss of German patents===
During [[World War I]], Germany invalidated all of Tigerstedt's patents. After the war, he received compensation from the German government, but the sum quickly became worthless due to the [[hyperinflation]] in Germany during 1921 to 1923. In 1922, Tigerstedt moved his laboratory to Finland and founded a new company called “Tigerstedts patenter”, which however also failed.

===Move to America===
In 1923, Tigerstedt moved to America where he founded his last company, the Tiger Manufacturing Co., to produce small [[Receiver (radio)|radio receivers]] and [[Cryptography|cryptographic devices]]. The Mexican government purchased two of the cryptographic devices, and the radio receivers also sold relatively well. Tigerstedt had the opportunity to meet with the great American inventor [[Thomas Alva Edison]], who wrote a letter of recommendation for Tigerstedt to the director of the [[Department of Commerce]].

=== Death ===
When it finally seemed that Tigerstedt was on the verge of commercial success, he was involved in an ultimately fatal car accident on April 20, 1924, when another car unexpectedly turned in front of the car Tigerstedt was travelling in. There were persistent rumours that a competitor had arranged for the accident, but there was never any proof of this.

Exactly one year later, on April 20, 1925, he succumbed to [[tuberculosis]] at the New York [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] Hospital, possibly due to side effects from his injuries in the car accident. He wrote his last letter to his brother Göran, in which he described the state of his company, explained the structure of a new [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|membrane]] that he was developing,&lt;ref&gt;Item ''a'' in [http://www.fsfl.se/voxbilder/filmhist/tigerstedt_2.jpg Image labelled "Zu der Patentschrift 309535"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsfl.se/backspegel/tigerstedt.html described as "membran" in its caption] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012532/http://www.fsfl.se/backspegel/tigerstedt.html |date=2007-09-27 }}, appears suitable to function as an [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|acoustic diaphragm]].&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that he was about to undergo a [[kidney]] operation due to the spreading tuberculosis. Unfortunately, medical science was not advanced enough to be able to save his life. After his death, his brother travelled to America and brought his ashes home for burial in Helsinki. As with many inventors, Tigerstedt's inventions were never fully appreciated during his own lifetime.

== Inventions ==
Tigerstedt experimented in many areas. He developed a new version of the [[shotgun]] that could be fired using the thumbs and that counted the number of shots fired. Unfortunately, he was perennially short of funds, and he did not have enough financial standing to file for a [[patent]].

===Sound-on-film technology===
Tigerstedt's greatest interest was in the field of sound recording. He had developed a prototype for recording sound on a metal wire as early as 1912 and was convinced that he could find a way to record sound directly on motion picture film. He started his first experiments in [[Helsinki]] using very primitive equipment. The sentence he attempted to record was in [[German language|German]]: "Grau ist alle Theorie. Grün ist nur des Lebens Baum". Finally, he succeeded and he called his invention the "photomagnetophone". Unfortunately, his achievements did not gain any recognition, nor did he reap any financial gains from his invention, so he had to maintain a day job in order to earn a modest living and could only continue his experiments in the evenings and into the nights, sometimes working all through the night without any sleep.
After meeting his former schoolmate Alfred Nybom in Berlin, he succeeded in using Nybom's connections to gain access to a [[research]] laboratory and employment as an inventor. Film with audio was recognised as a commercially promising field of endeavour, but Tigerstedt's invention needed further development before it could be commercialised. There was as yet no technology available to electronically amplify the audio signal sufficiently to fill a large movie theatre. Tigerstedt also enlarged his vision of [[video]] [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] in the future. He wrote: "There will come a time when people can sit at home and follow events in the world through a device I now call the 'electronic eye'. When people get used to film with sound, they will soon adopt the electric eye, or electrophtalmoscope". When his father learned of his thinking, he tried to persuade him to not let his imagination carry him away, " ... otherwise you will surely end your days in the [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] in [[Lapinlahti]]."

Tigerstedt returned to Germany in 1913 and continued developing the photomagnetophone, but there was still no solution to the problem of amplification. He experimented with early versions of the vacuum tube and eventually was able to amplify the sound, but with disappointing results.

Tigerstedt also continued developing the electrophtalmoscope. The prototype consisted of vibrating mirrors in both the sending and receiving apparatus, using the photoelectric properties of a [[selenium]] element at the sender and a [[light]] source at the receiving end which was [[modulation|modulated]] using a [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]] device. The received picture was supposed to be displayed on a movie [[Projection screen|screen]]. Two electrophtalmoscopes were built and an experiment was conducted using an electrical cable running from London to Berlin. Tigerstedt arranged several demonstrations and gained a reputation as a knowledgeable scientist.

===Improving on Lee de Forest's vacuum tube===
Tigerstedt stubbornly continued to grapple with the problems of the early vacuum tubes, which were inefficient, expensive and prone to breaking. His German colleagues told him that the vacuum tubes could not be developed further and that there could be no solution to the problem with the weakness of amplification. Tigerstedt, however, continued to experiment and eventually succeeded in substantially improving on the design of [[Lee De Forest]], achieving much greater amplification than that of the original valves. Tigerstedt also patented his improvement of the [[triode]] vacuum valve, which consisted of improving the amplification by rearranging the [[electrodes]] cylindrically in the tube, changing the [[glass]] mold to prevent [[vacuum]] loss and using steel mirrors inside the tubes to prevent electrostatic [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]]. He had finally solved the most difficult practical problems of talking movies. It is worth noting that his achievement was purely experimental, as there were no prior experiments or mathematical models that he could have followed.

===Patent for sound-on-film technology and expulsion from Germany===
This was a major step forward for Tigerstedt, and he was soon able to show a film with sound which was electronically amplified and reproduced through a speaker system. Beginning in 1919, de Forest created his own sound-on-film system, which he called [[Phonofilm]] and which used some of Tigerstedt's concepts, along with some of the [[Tri-Ergon]] group and of inventor [[Theodore Case]]. Tigerstedt was awarded a German patent (number 309,536) on July 28, 1914 for his [[sound-on-film]] process.

One month later, Tigerstedt was summoned by the German authorities, told that he had been declared an unwanted Russian citizen, and given three days to leave the country. [[World War I]] had started and Finland was at that time part of the Russian empire, having been ceded to Russia after the [[Finnish War|1808-1809 war between Sweden and Russia]]. As another consequence of the declaration of war between Russia and Germany, the German government invalidated all German patents held by citizens of enemy nations.

===Ultrasound experiments===
Tigerstedt moved to Denmark, where he continued working on film sound recording devices at the Petersen &amp; Poulsen company. He befriended the Danish inventor [[Valdemar Poulsen]] (1869–1942), who was the inventor of the [[telegraphone]] steel wire magnetic recorder. Tigerstedt, too, had experimented with recording sound on a steel wire. He attempted to transmit speech across the [[Jutland]] straits using 30 [[Hertz|kHz]] ultrasound, but the results were not promising. He also experimented with transmitting sound underwater, which was more successful, and he was eventually granted a patent for this process.

===Communication device===
A [[Aviator|pilot]] suggested to Tigerstedt that he should develop a device to facilitate communication between two pilots while seated one behind the other in an open [[biplane]]. Tigerstedt invented a device which had a very small earpiece that could be plugged into the ear. Tigerstedt spent considerable time on designing the earpiece. The device was also found to be helpful to people who were hard of hearing, offering a possible alternative to the large ear trumpets then in use as hearing aids.

'''Ernesto Igel''' (November 27, 1893 – January 24, 1966) was an Austrian entrepreneur and founder of the company Empresa Brasileira de Gáz a Domilicio Ltda, the first Brazilian gas distribution network of fuel for cooking equipment (LPG).&lt;ref name=UOL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1994/1/11/dinheiro/18.html|title=Casa centro negocia participação na Ultralar |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, the company changed its name to [[Ultragaz]] S.A.&lt;ref name=UOL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1994/1/11/dinheiro/18.html|title=Casa centro negocia participação na Ultralar |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HistóriadeEmpresas"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://historiadeempresas.wordpress.com/2012/07/01/ultralar-uma-das-pioneiras-no-setor-de-grandes-magazines/|title=Ultralar, uma das pioneiras no setor de grandes magazinas |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Exame&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exame.abril.com.br/negocios/melhores-e-maiores/empresas/ficha/ultragaz/2012|title= Maiores empresas do Brasil de 2012 |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IPEM&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ipemsp.wordpress.com/botijao-de-gas/|title= Botijão de Gás como tudo começou |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through Ultragaz's growth and the creation of new companies, Ernesto Igel founded [[Ultra - Company|Ultra]], also known as Ultrapar.

==Early life==

Born to a family of merchants in Vienna, Austria, Igel was the eldest of five children. At 15, he got his first job at an import-export company. At 21, he was drafted to the Austrian army to fight in [[World War I]]. He was sent to [[Romania]], where he served as a management assistant.&lt;ref name=RevendadeGLPBlog&gt;{{cite web |url=http://revendadeglp.blogspot.com/2010/07/historia-do-glp-no-brasil.html|title=História do GPL no Brasil |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ebah&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebah.com.br/content/ABAAAAgkAAD/distribuicao-glp|title=Distribuição de GLP |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After the war, Igel moved to Brazil in 1920 when he was 26 years old. He then established the company Ernesto Igel &amp; Cia., an importer of tableware, sanitary metals, stoves and heaters for use with pipeline gas. During his trips to Europe, Igel got to work with the then-new gas bottling technology for domestic use.&lt;ref name=TrabalhosFeitos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trabalhosfeitos.com/ensaios/Vista-Tecnica/30885944.html|title=Visita Técnica |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 30, 1937, Igel founded Empresa Brasileira de Gáz a Domicílio Ltda. The following year, in September 1938, the company's IPO set the start of Ultragaz S.A. After that, the company extended its operations and began to conduct business throughout Brazil.&lt;ref name=UOL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1994/1/11/dinheiro/18.html|title=Casa centro negocia participação na Ultralar |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HistóriadeEmpresas"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://historiadeempresas.wordpress.com/2012/07/01/ultralar-uma-das-pioneiras-no-setor-de-grandes-magazines/|title=Ultralar, uma das pioneiras no setor de grandes magazinas |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Exame&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exame.abril.com.br/negocios/melhores-e-maiores/empresas/ficha/ultragaz/2012|title= Maiores empresas do Brasil de 2012 |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IPEM&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ipemsp.wordpress.com/botijao-de-gas/|title= Botijão de Gás como tudo começou |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

The businessman headed the administration of their companies until 1959, when he named his son, [[Pery Igel]], as the new head of Ultragaz.&lt;ref name="Sindigás"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sindigas.com.br/Sindigas/Historico.aspx|title=Breve relato sobre o gás LP no Brasil |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MundodasMarcas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mundodasmarcas.blogspot.com/2014_01_19_archive.html|title=Ultragaz |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''error account''' is a type of account used for storing compensation for errors in trading, a transaction that is not posted in a timely manner because of inconsistencies, such as an incorrect account or routing numbers to the wrong name on the account, producing a claim that needs to be resolved as soon as possible so payments can be made.

== Transaction processing ==
When many hundreds or thousands of transactions are being done each day, and whenever there is human input involved, error accounts are necessary to keep the [[audit trail]] intact. Error accounts also play a role in improving [[customer service]]. GAAP recommends daily or weekly monitoring of error accounts depending on volume and transaction size. It is typically up to the company or applicable government department's accounting department to monitor the error accounts that it has in place.

In 1994, [[Nick Leeson]] used a poorly monitored error account at [[Barings Bank]] in an attempt to cover up evidence of his trading losses and place ever larger unauthorized trades to win back the money. In doing so, he lost over £800&amp;nbsp;million and bankrupted his employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/375259.stm | work=BBC News | title=How Leeson broke the bank | date=1999-06-22 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Error accounts can be implemented in manual accounting as well, but this is much less common in the developed world since personal computers became pervasive.

==Biography==
Esther Gordy Edwards was born to Berry Gordy, Sr. and Bertha Fuller Gordy in [[Baldwin County, Georgia]].  She was the couple's second oldest child and eldest daughter. When she was two years old, her parents moved to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. Edwards' younger siblings included sisters [[Anna Gordy Gaye|Anna]], the late Loucye, and [[Gwen Gordy Fuqua|Gwen]], as well as brothers Fuller, George, Berry and [[Robert Gordy|Robert]], who was the youngest of [[Gordy family|the family]]. Edwards attended Detroit's prestigious [[Cass Technical High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daahp.wayne.edu/biographiesDisplay.php?id=73 |title=Biography Search Display |publisher=Daahp.wayne.edu |date=1920-04-25 |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later graduated from [[Howard University]]. Esther married Detroit politician George Edwards in 1951. From a previous relationship, she has a son by Robert Theron Bullock named Robert Berry Bullock, and through him has three granddaughters named Robin, Elesha and Gwen and grandson Alejandro Quinn a Major in the United States Marine Corps.

===Career===
Edwards founded the Gordy Printing Company with two of her brothers in the mid-1940s.  With her husband, they created the Ber-Berry Co-Op, which was intended to provide loans to family members. Her younger brother Berry reportedly asked for an $800 loan to help start Motown Records in 1959.  After Motown became established, Edwards took an active role in management and booking tours, including the legendary [[Motortown Revue]] in the early 1960s.  While at Motown, Edwards took on a motherly role towards some of the label's younger acts.  In the mid-1960s, she served as Motown's vice president and [[chief executive officer]].  She was succeeded in this role by [[Smokey Robinson]] in 1972.  Edwards later served on the board for the Detroit Bank of Commonwealth and the Greater Detroit Chamber of Commerce.

In 1985, Edwards became the director of the Motown Historical Museum ([[Hitsville U.S.A.]]) and has since been credited with carefully maintaining the original studios of Motown. Edwards is often described as "the pillar of Motown".

===Death===
Esther died surrounded by family and friends, following a long illness, at her [[Jefferson Towers]] home in Detroit on August 24, 2011.  She was 91 years old.&lt;ref name="DetroitNewsObit"/&gt;

===UEFA===
Gianni Infantino started working with the [[UEFA]] in August 2000, and was appointed as the Director of UEFA's Legal Affairs and Club Licensing Division in January 2004.

He oversaw the expansion of [[UEFA Euro 2016]] to 24 teams&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/sports/soccer/gianni-infantino-fifa-president-election.html|title=In FIFA Pitch, Gianni Infantino Pushes Expansion and Continuity|last=Borden|first=Sam|date=2016-02-24|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played a role in the conception of the [[UEFA Nations League]] and the [[UEFA Euro 2020]], that will take place in 13 European nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro-2020/news/newsid=1913839.html|title=Thirteen cities to host UEFA EURO 2020|last=|website=UEFA.com|access-date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Greek government]] decided to introduce a new sports law in response to the recent [[2015 Greek football scandal|scandal]] and acts of violence and corruption mainly in [[Football in Greece|Greek football]]. Gianni Infantino, as [[UEFA]]'s general secretary, led the negotiations with the Greek government and supported the [[Hellenic Football Federation]]'s warning to Greece that it faces suspension from international football for government interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thetoc.gr/eng/news/article/uefa--fifa-warn-greece-over-governments-planned-new-football-laws|title=UEFA &amp; FIFA warn Greece over government's planned new football laws {{!}}thetoc.gr|website=The TOC In English|language=en-US|access-date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insideworldfootball.com/world-football/europe/16938-exclusive-infantino-fires-second-warning-shot-to-greece-over-football-law-proposal|title=Exclusive: Infantino fires second warning shot to Greece over football law proposal - Inside World Football|last=Nicholson|first=Paul|website=www.insideworldfootball.com|access-date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infantino was a member of FIFA's Reform Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/committees/committee=1945421/index.html|title=FIFA Committees - 2016 FIFA Reform Committee - FIFA.com|website=FIFA.com|language=en-GB|access-date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October 2015, he received the backing of the UEFA Executive Committee to stand for the position of president in the 2016 FIFA Extraordinary Congress. On the same day, he confirmed his candidacy and submitted the required declarations of support.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uefa.org/about-uefa/news/newsid=2299067.html|title=Statement from UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino|last=|website=UEFA.com|access-date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He promised to expand the [[FIFA World Cup]] to forty teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/10/gianni-infantino-fifa-election-world-cup-40-teams|title=Gianni Infantino to expand World Cup to 40 teams if elected Fifa president|last=Associated Press|first=|date=2015-11-10|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 26 February 2016, he was elected FIFA President for a period of three years.&lt;ref name="FIFA_president"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2016/m=2/news=gianni-infantino-elected-fifa-president-2767180.html|title=Gianni Infantino elected FIFA President|publisher=FIFA.com|date=26 February 2016|access-date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss man Infantino holds dual citizenship through his parents. With his election, he became the first Italian to hold the Presidency of FIFA.

In 2017, Infantino criticized the United States [[Trump travel ban|travel ban]] on several [[Muslim world|Muslim]]-majority nations. He said "When it comes to FIFA competitions, any team, including the supporters and officials of that team, who qualify for a World Cup need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup. That is obvious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Donald Trump travel ban could prevent USA from hosting 2026 World Cup |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/donald-trump-travel-ban-usa-world-cup-2026-world-cup-hosts-a7620916.html |work=The Independent |date=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the start of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Infantino stated in February of that year that he is "very satisfied so far with the progress in Russia. I’m sure we’ll have a great World Cup there – not only a great World Cup but the best World Cup ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gianni Infantino satisfied with Russia’s World Cup preparations |url=http://www.winworldcup.com/en/gianni-infantino-satisfied-russias-world-cup-preparations/ |work=Win World Cup 2018 |date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panama Papers===
{{see also|Panama Papers}}
Infantino was implicated in the FIFA corruption scandal in documents released in the 2016 Panama Papers. They show that the UEFA undertook deals with indicted figures where previously they had denied any relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/05/panama-papers-pull-fifa-uefa-chief-gianni-infantino-corruption-scandal|title=Panama Papers: Fifa president Gianni Infantino pulled into corruption scandal|author=Owen Gibson|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infantino has stated he is "dismayed" at the reports and that he has never personally dealt with the parties involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2016/m=4/news=statement-from-fifa-president-gianni-infantino-2779887.html|title=Statement from FIFA President Gianni Infantino|date=5 April 2016|work=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== FIFA ethics investigations ==
In July 2016, Infantino was suspected to have broken the FIFA code of ethics, and was interviewed by the investigatory chamber of the [[FIFA Ethics Committee]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36795446|title=Fifa president Gianni Infantino to be interviewed by ethics committee|date=2016-07-14|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The investigation was focused on three areas: "several flights taken by Mr. Infantino during the first months of his presidency, human resources matters related to hiring processes in the president's office, and Mr. Infantino's refusal to sign the contract specifying his employment relationship with FIFA".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/gianni-infantino-fifa-president-cleared-following-ethics-committee-investigation-a7173616.html|title=Fifa president Gianni Infantino cleared of breaching ethics code|date=2016-08-05|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Even though a document was leaked which showed illegitimate spending of funds by FIFA&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the matter concerning expenses and governance was not investigated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The document revealed that Infantino had billed FIFA for personal expenses such as £8,795 for [[mattress]]es at his home, £6,829 for a stepper exercise machine, £1,086 for a [[tuxedo]], £677 on flowers and £132 on personal laundry. In addition to that he billed the FIFA governing body for an external driver for his family and advisors while he was away.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

When Infantino accepted special treatment by the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosts [[Russia]] and [[Qatar]], the question of a potential [[conflict of interest]] was raised. The hosts had organized private jets for Infantino and his staff related to visits in Russia and the Gulf state.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The investigatory chamber was of the opinion that no violation had occurred. In addition to that, the chamber found that "human resources matters, as well as Mr. Infantino's conduct with regard to his contract with FIFA, if at all, constituted internal compliance issues rather than an ethical matter."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

While the investigatory chamber discharged Infantino, this did not stop criticism. [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]], a former German football champion, criticized Infantino for not fulfilling his promises regarding transparency, democracy and governance.

'''Gilbert fitz Gilbert de Clare''' ({{circa|1100}}{{snd}}6 January 1148), was created [[Earl of Pembroke]] in 1138.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;He was called 'Strongbow' but his son Richard is much more readily associated with that nickname.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Born at [[Tonbridge]], Gilbert de Clare was a son of [[Gilbert Fitz Richard|Gilbert Fitz Richard de Clare]] and Alice de Claremont.&lt;ref&gt;George Edward Cokayne, ''The Complete Peerage; or, A History of the House of Lords and All its Members from the Earliest Times'', Vol. X, Eds. H. A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H. White, &amp; Howard de Walden (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1945), p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; He started out without land and wealth of his own but was closely related to very powerful men, specifically his uncles [[Walter de Clare]] and Roger de Clare.&lt;ref&gt;David Walker, ''Medieval Wales'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1136 Gilbert fitz Gilbert led an expedition against [[Exmes]] and burned parts of the town, including the church of Notre Dame, but was interrupted by the forces of [[William III, Count of Ponthieu]] and escaped the resulting melee only after suffering heavy losses.&lt;ref&gt;George Edward Cokayne, ''The Complete Peerage; or, A History of the House of Lords and All its Members from the Earliest Times'', Vol. X, Eds. H. A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H. White, &amp; Howard de Walden (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1945), p. 348, &amp; footnote (a)&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert was a Baron, that is, a [[tenant-in-chief]] in England, and inherited the estates of his paternal uncles, Roger and Walter, which included the baronies and castles of Bienfaite and [[Orbec]] in [[Normandy]]. He held the lordship of Nether Gwent and the castle of [[Striguil]] (later [[Chepstow Castle|Chepstow]]). [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] created him [[Earl of Pembroke]], and gave him the [[Rape (county subdivision)|rape]] and [[Pevensey Castle|castle of Pevensey]].

After Stephen's [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|defeat at Lincoln]] on 2 February 1141, Gilbert was among those who rallied to [[Empress Matilda]] when she recovered London in June, but he was at [[Canterbury]] when Stephen was recrowned late in 1141.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Round, ''Geoffrey de Mandeville'' (Longmans, Green, 1892), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined Geoffrey's plot against Stephen, but when that conspiracy collapsed, he again adhered to Stephen, being with him at the siege of [[Oxford]] late in 1142. In 1147 he rebelled when Stephen refused to give him the castles surrendered by his nephew [[Gilbert Fitz Richard de Clare|Gilbert]], 2nd [[Earl of Hertford]], whereupon the King marched to his nearest castle and nearly captured him. However, the Earl appears to have made his peace with Stephen before his death the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dalton, Graeme J. White. ''King Stephen's Reign (1135-1154)''King Stephen's Reign (1135-1154)'' (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2008), pp. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
He married Isabel de Beaumont, before 1130, daughter of Sir [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert de Beaumont]], 1st [[Earl of Leicester]], Count of Meulan, and [[Elizabeth of Vermandois, Countess of Leicester|Elizabeth de Vermandois]].&lt;ref&gt;George Edward Cokayne, ''The Complete Peerage; or, A History of the House of Lords and All its Members from the Earliest Times'', Vol. X, Eds. H. A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H. White, &amp; Howard de Walden (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1945), p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; Isabel had previously been the mistress of King [[Henry I of England]].&lt;ref&gt;George Edward Cokayne, ''The Complete Peerage; or, A History of the House of Lords and All its Members from the Earliest Times'', Vol. VII, Eds. H. A. Doubleday &amp; Howard de Walden (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1929), p. 526, footnote (c)&lt;/ref&gt;

By her Gilbert had: 
* [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]]&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;[[William Dugdale]] had credited Gilbert, the first Earl of Pembroke, with a second son who was named Baldwin fitz Gilbert; but [[J. Horace Round|Round]] showed that this Baldwin was really his brother. See: CP: X, Appendix H, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Edward Cokayne, ''The Complete Peerage; or, A History of the House of Lords and All its Members from the Earliest Times'', Vol. X, Eds. H. A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H. White, &amp; Howard de Walden (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1945), p. 352-57, Appendix H, pp. 102-04&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guy David Innes-Ker, 10th Duke of Roxburghe'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guy Roxburghe's Official Profile on The Marque |url=https://www.themarque.com/profile/guy-roxburghe}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 18 November 1954), styled '''Marquess of Bowmont and Cessford''' until 1974, is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[aristocracy|aristocrat]].

==Early life==
Guy David Innes-Ker was born 18 November 1954 to the [[George Innes-Ker, 9th Duke of Roxburghe|9th Duke]] by his second wife [[Margaret Innes-Ker, Duchess of Roxburghe|(Margaret) Elisabeth McConnel]] (1918–1993). The Duke has a younger brother, Lord Robert Innes-Ker (b. 1959), who is married, with one son and one daughter.

He was educated at [[Eton College]], [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], where he studied Land Economy, and at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] where he was awarded the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst#Sword of Honour|Sword of Honour]] in 1974, in which year he became a [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|Lieutenant]] in the [[Blues and Royals]].

==Career==
He is a [[Liveryman]] of the [[Worshipful Company of Fishmongers]] and a [[Freedom of the City#Freedom of the City of London|Freeman]] of the [[City of London]].

===Peerage===
He succeeded his father to the title of [[Duke of Roxburghe]] in 1974.  He is also the Premier [[Baronet]] of Scotland, and the 30th [[feudal baron]] of Innes.

The heirs in the Innes-Ker family to the dukedom are the present Duke's three sons, his younger brother, and a nephew. According to the earldom's remainder to ''heirs male'' (since the dukedom remainder is to ''heirs of the earldom''), there are no further proper heirs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} However, there is precedence in the title moving contrary to its remainder{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, if an unlikely extinction of the heirs male to the family takes place.

==Personal life==
The Duke has been married twice. His first marriage was on 10 September 1977 to Lady Jane Meriel Grosvenor (b. 8 February 1953; Lady Jane Dawnay since 1996), younger daughter of [[Robert Grosvenor, 5th Duke of Westminster]]; the couple had two sons and a daughter. They divorced in 1990. Their children are:
*Lady Rosanagh Viola Alexandra Innes-Ker (b. 16 January 1979), a bridesmaid at the 1986 wedding of [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]]. She married James Walter Grimston, Viscount Grimston (son of [[John Grimston, 7th Earl of Verulam]]) on 26 June 2008. They have three children:
**Hon. John Innes Archie Grimston (b. 10 August 2010)
**Hon. Guy Robert Grimston (b. 21 December 2011)
**Hon. Violet Mary Grimston (b. 8 October 2014)
*[[Charles Innes-Ker, Marquess of Bowmont and Cessford|Charles Robert George Innes-Ker, Marquess of Bowmont and Cessford]] (b. 18 February 1981), who married Hon. Charlotte Susanna Aitken (b. 15 Feb 1982) eldest daughter of [[Maxwell Aitken, 3rd Baron Beaverbrook]]) on 22 July 2011. They were divorced in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2157059/Dukes-son-Charlie-ends-marriage-year.html|title=Duke's son Charlie ends his marriage after a year|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Lord Edward "Ted" Arthur Gerald Innes-Ker&lt;ref&gt;Laura Collins and Louise Hannah [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/femail/article.html?in_article_id=457874&amp;in_page_id=1879 "As Kate re-emerges more tanned and confident, a new Middleton girl takes a bow"] ''Daily Mail'' 27 May 2007. The article features a photograph of Lord Ted Innes-Ker (described as a friend of [[Pippa Middleton]]) and his sister (then) Lady Rose Innes-Ker.&lt;/ref&gt; (b. 2 February 1984). He married Celia Brook on 29 July 2017.

The Duke remarried 3 September 1992, interior designer Virginia Mary, née Wynn-Williams (1st daughter of David Wynn-Williams). They have a son and a daughter. Their children are:
*Lady Isabella May Innes-Ker (b. September 1994)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Burke's Peerage]]'' (2003) volume 3, page 4134, from [http://thepeerage.com/p245.htm thepeerage.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Soames|first1=Matilda|title=10 PERFECT POTENTIAL BRIDES FOR PRINCE HARRY!|url=http://www.tatler.com/news/articles/october-2016/brides-for-prince-harry-wedding|website=Tatler}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lord George Alastair Innes-Ker (b. 20 November 1996)

The Duke lives at [[Floors Castle]], [[Kelso, Scotland|Kelso]], [[Roxburghshire]]. In December 2009, he was diagnosed with [[oesophageal cancer]] and has been receiving treatment for the condition in London.

'''IRI''' is a [[market research]] company headquartered in the U.S. which provides clients with consumer, shopper, and retail market intelligence and analysis focused on the [[consumer packaged goods]] (CPG) industry.  

==History==
Information Resources, Incorporated (IRI) was formed in [[Chicago]] in 1979 by market researcher John Malec and Gerald Eskin, a [[University of Iowa]] marketing professor.&lt;ref name=crain&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160220/ISSUE01/302209994/iri-uses-big-data-to-predict-purchases-of-consumer-packaged-goods|title=IRI's new purpose in consumer research|author=Brigid Sweeney|publisher=[[Crain's Chicago Business]]|date =February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two purchased scanners for supermarkets to gather point-of-sale data based on bar codes in grocery stores that could be sold to CPG companies to track what customers purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://sync-magazine.com/2017/iri-andrewappel/|title=IRI and the Hub of the Data Ecosystem|author=Adam Kivel|publisher=Sync Magazine|date =September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; IRI became a [[public company]] in 
1983.&lt;ref name="Honomichl Top 50 Report, 2012"&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.ama.org/Documents/2012-Hono-Top-50.pdf|title=Honomichl Top 50 Report|publisher=[[American Marketing Association]]|date =January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1993 [[Fortune Magazine]] named IRI a "company to watch" for expanding into two of its biggest markets: analyzing nationwide scanner data on consumer products and producing computer software.  At that time slightly more than half IRI's revenues came from Infoscan, its marketing data service.&lt;ref name="Fortune"&gt;{{cite web| url =https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1993/12/27/78787/index.htm|title=COMPANIES TO WATCH|author=JOHN LABATE |publisher=[[CNNMoney]]|date =December 27, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2003, IRI was acquired by a joint-venture cooperation between enterprise software provider [[Symphony Technology Group]] and investment capital firm Tennenbaum Capital Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://adage.com/article/news/iri-sold-108-4-million/37856/|title=IRI TO BE SOLD FOR $108.4 MILLION|author=Jack Neff |publisher=[[Adage]]|date =June 30, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, SymphonyIRI Group, Inc. announced that it was rebranding as IRI.&lt;ref name=supermarket&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supermarketnews.com/center-store/symphonyiri-rebrands-iri|title=SymphonyIRI Rebrands to IRI|publisher=Supermarket News|date=April 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, New York-based private equity firm [[New Mountain Capital]] bought SymphonyIRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmountaincapital.com/media/46278/20151001.pdf|title=IRI: Crafting A Crystal Ball With Consumer Spending Data |publisher=[[New Mountain Capital]]|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company announced that it was changing its name back to Information Resources Inc., or IRI.&lt;ref name=supermarket/&gt; 

In September 2013, IRI acquired Aztec, a provider of market measurement and related services for consumer packaged goods (CPG), liquor and pharmaceutical manufacturers and retailers in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom. This was the largest acquisition in IRI’s history and significantly expanded IRI’s geographic presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.drugstorenews.com/news/iri-acquires-aztec-aegis-media/|title=IRI acquires Aztec from Aegis Media|author=Michael Johnsen
 |publisher=Drug Store News|date=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
In February 2004, IRI named former [[DXC Technology|Electronic Data Systems Corp]] executive Scott Klein as its president and CEO, succeeding Joe Durrett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://adage.com/article/people-players/iri-names-president-ceo/39352/|title=IRI NAMES NEW PRESIDENT-CEO|author=Jack Neff |publisher=[[Adage]]|date =February 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein served as CEO until October 2007, when he moved to IRI's parent company, Symphony Technology Group, and was succeeded by former [[Salesforce.com]] executive John Freeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://adage.com/article/people-players/freeland-takes-ceo-post-iri/120864/|title=FREELAND TAKES CEO POST AT IRI|author=Jack Neff |publisher=[[Adage]]|date =October 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, SymphonyIRI Group, Inc. appointed former [[Aon (company)|Aon]] COO and [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] senior partner, Andrew Appel, as president and CEO to succeed John G. Freeland, who moved to an interim role as executive vice chairman.&lt;ref name=crain/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.supermarketnews.com/latest-news/symphonyiri-names-appel-president-ceo|title=SymphonyIRI Names Appel President, CEO|publisher=Supermarket News|date=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing''' ('''IUU''') is an international issue around the world. Industry observers believe IUU occurs in most fisheries, and accounts for up to 30% of total catches in some important fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;World Wildlife Fund: [http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/what_we_do/marine/problems/problems_fishing/illegal_fishing/index.cfm Fishing problems: Illegal fishing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411060604/http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/what_we_do/marine/problems/problems_fishing/illegal_fishing/index.cfm |date=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Illegal fishing''' takes place when vessels or harvesters operate in violation of the laws of a [[fishery]]. This can apply to fisheries that are under the jurisdiction of a coastal state or to [[International waters|high seas]] fisheries regulated by regional fisheries management organisations (RFMO). According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), Fisheries and Aquaculture Department, illegal fishing has caused losses estimated at US$23 billion per year with about 30% of illegal fishing in the world occurring in [[Indonesia]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2014/07/19/056594269/Almost-Half-of-Illegal-Fishing-in-the-World-Occur-in-Indonesia |title=Almost Half of Illegal Fishing in the World Occur in Indonesia |author=Ella Syafputri |date=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unreported fishing''' is fishing that has been unreported or misreported to the relevant national authority or RFMO, in contravention of applicable laws and regulations.

'''Unregulated fishing''' generally refers to fishing by vessels without nationality, vessels flying the flag of a country not party to the RFMO governing that fishing area or species on the high seas, or harvesting in unregulated areas.

The drivers behind illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing are similar to those behind many other types of international [[environmental crime]]: pirate fishers have a strong economic incentive -- many species of fish, particularly those that have been [[over-exploited]] and are thus in short supply, are of high financial value.

Such IUU activity may then show a high chance of success – i.e. a high [[rate of return]] – from the failure of governments to regulate adequately (e.g. inadequate coverage of international agreements), or to enforce national or international laws (e.g. because of lack of capacity, or poor levels of governance). A particular driver behind IUU fishing is the failure of a number of flag states to exercise effective regulation over ships on their registers &amp;mdash; which in turn creates an incentive for ships to register under these [[flag of convenience|flags of convenience]].

Since no one reports catches made by pirates, their level of fishing cannot be accurately quantified. 

==Economic and environmental impacts==
One economic impact of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing on developing countries is the direct loss of the value of the catches that could be taken by local fishermen if the IUU fishing were not taking place.

These losses include a loss to GNP, and government revenues from [[landing fee]]s, licence fees, and taxes payable by legal fishing operators. There are further indirect impacts in terms of loss of income and employment in related industries; losses in income will tend to reduce the consumer expenditures of families working in the [[fishing industry]].

IUU harvests may be brought to market at a lower price as unfair competition to the same products from the regulated supply or as a mislabeled competing product. In either situation this illegal unregulated contribution to the market may lower the overall quality and price of products available, thus creating an economic burden on harvesters following the laws and regulations.

Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing can have a significant impact on the sustainability of both the targeted species and the ecosystem. Fishing generally has the capacity to damage fragile marine ecosystems and vulnerable species such as [[coral reef]]s, turtles and seabirds. In fact, all eight [[sea turtle]] species are now endangered, and illegal fishing and hunting are two major reasons for their destruction. Regulating legitimate fisheries is aimed at mitigating such impacts, but IUU fishers rarely comply with regulations. This may reduce future productivity and biodiversity and create imbalances in the ecosystem.

This may lead to reduced [[food security]] in communities heavily dependent on fish as a source of animal protein.

IUU fishing can also lead to increased pressure on endangered fish species.  IUU fishing can directly affect the population of fish species by increasing the number of fish caught within the population in spite of population management efforts by the international community.  Indirectly, the substitution ([[Applied Food Technologies#Economic fraud resulting from fish mislabeling|mislabeling]]) of IUU caught fish for popular, but threatened or endangered species, increases the perceived supply of these species, thus decreasing the price and increasing the demand for the fish species.

==Certification and labeling==
Mandatory [[product certification]] and catch documentation are increasingly part of fishery monitoring and enforcement, and to exclude IUU products from consumer markets. Certification is also used for timber and for diamonds, which have analogous enforcement problems. Labels can reward harvesters and supply chains which honor regulations. Labeling may also provide accountability for [[adaptive management]] planning, as well-managed fisheries may provide higher quality products and more stable economics for producers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ia/iuu/noaa_taskforce_report_final.pdf Presidential Task Force on Combating IUU Fishing and Seafood Fraud Action Plan for Implementing the Task Force Recommendations] at noaa.gov. 2014-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waitt Institute. [http://waittinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IUU-Waitt-Institute-Factsheet-13Mar2015.pdf Factsheet: Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of certification or catch document schemes is encouraged in the [[FAO]]'s [[International Plan of Action on IUU Fishing]]. Several [[RFMOs]] include them, including [[CCAMLR]]'s [[Catch Documentation Scheme for Toothfish]], [[CCSBT]]'s [[Trade Information Scheme for Southern Bluefin Tuna]] and [[ICCAT]]'s [[Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document Programme]]. Similar systems are applied at a national level, including the USA's [[Certification of Origin of Tuna and Tuna Tracking and Verification Systems]], Japan's reporting requirements (including area of capture) for all imports or transportation of tunas into Japan by boat, and the EU’s labelling of all fish products (including area of capture).

===Marine Stewardship Council===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:MSC ecolabel.png|thumb|right|125px|The MSC ecolabel for certified, traceable sustainable seafood]] --&gt;The [[Marine Stewardship Council]] (MSC) is an international [[non-profit organization]] that runs a certification and ecolabelling program for traceable, sustainable seafood.

To achieve certification as sustainable a fishery must meet a standard based on three principles:

# ensuring healthy [[fish stock]]s
# minimal impact on the marine ecosystem
# effective management (which includes ensuring the fishery operates within national and international laws).

Fisheries that meet the MSC standard for a sustainable fishery can use the blue MSC ecolabel on their [[seafood products]].

The second element of the program is a certification for seafood traceability. This is called MSC Chain of Custody. From the fishery, every company in the [[supply chain]] that handles the certified fish is checked to ensure the MSC label is only applied to fish products that come from a certified fishery. This requires effective record-keeping and storage procedures. This traceability element of the program helps to keep illegally fished seafood out of the supply chain by linking seafood sold in shops and restaurants to a certified sustainable fishery.

The MSC eco-label enables consumers to easily identify sustainable seafood when shopping or dining out. As of June 2014, there are over 14,000 MSC-labelled seafood products sold in over 90 countries around the world.  The MSC website lists outlets selling MSC-certified seafood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msc.org/where-to-buy/msc-labelled-seafood-in-shops-and-restaurants]&lt;/ref&gt;

The six MSC certified [[Patagonian toothfish]] and Antarctic toothfish fisheries (which are the South Georgia, Ross Sea, Heard Island, Macquarie Island, Kerguelen Islands and Falkland Islands fisheries) provide a good example of how good [[fisheries management]] can reverse the trend of illegal fishing. These fisheries took significant steps to exclude illegal vessels from their waters:

* strict vessel licensing systems are rigorously enforced,
* each vessel must have at least 1 CCAMLR approved Government observer on board its vessel to verify catch data,
* each vessel must have port-to-port monitoring of its movements via two tamper-proof Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) units on board,
* all toothfish product that is transported must be accompanied by a CCAMLR Dissostichus Catch Document (DCD), with details of where and when that fish was caught.

These are only some of the measures taken by the toothfish fisheries to achieve MSC certification.  Further information on each of these toothfish fisheries can be found on the MSC website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

====Responsible Fishing Scheme====
The Responsible Fishing Scheme is the only global standard that audits compliance on board fishing vessels, including ethical and welfare criteria. First launched in 2006 by Seafish to help fishing vessels demonstrate their commitment to a responsibly sourced catch, in January 2016 a revised scheme was launched to include the health and safety and welfare of crew on board. The new scheme has been re-developed in accordance with the requirements of internationally recognised standard ISO17065. Initially focused on vessels supplying the UK market, the scheme will be rolled out internationally over the next two years. 

The Responsible Fishing Scheme website has the most up to date information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seafish.org/rfs&lt;/ref&gt;

Seafish is the UK's authority on seafood. It was founded in 1981 by an Act of Parliament and aims to support all sectors of the seafood industry for a sustainable, profitable and socially responsible future. It is the only pan-industry body offering services to all parts of the industry, from the start of the supply chain at catching and aquaculture; through processing, importers, exporters and distributors of seafood right through to restaurants and retailers. Seafish is funded by a levy on the first sale of seafood landed in the UK. Its services are intended to support and improve the environmental sustainability, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the industry, as well as promoting responsibly-sourced seafood.

==Enforcement==
[[File:Proposed modification to the Damen Stan patrol vessel for the USCG.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Design for an environmental protection patrol vessel]]

Illegal and unreported fishing (two of the three components of IUU fishing) essentially arise from a failure to adequately enforce existing national and international laws. There are, however, many factors underlying enforcement failure, including, notably, poor levels of national governance.

There are obvious problems with enforcing fisheries regulations on the high seas, including locating and apprehending the pirate ships, but solutions are available, chiefly through improved monitoring and surveillance systems. 

Many fishermen are getting away with illegal, unreported, unregulated (IUU) ocean fishing due to the difficulty of monitoring every single fishing boat. This will begin to change with new technology that is able to watch and follow each boat from space consistently. This will be done through radio beacons, which all boats in the ocean are required to have. By implementing this new monitoring system, it will be impossible for fishermen to get away with IUU fishing in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2018/09/08/the-fight-against-illicit-fishing-of-the-oceans-is-moving-into-space|title=The fight against illicit fishing of the oceans is moving into space|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marine Stewardship Council|MSC]] systems are similarly of value within exclusive economic zones, including, for example, offshore patrols and licensing schemes.

==Flag state liability==
Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, states bear responsibility for the vessels (including fishing vessels) that fly their flag. While it is uncontroversial that individuals engaged in IUU fishing may be subject to legal sanctions, the extent to which flag states may be held liable under international law for the IUU fishing activities of their vessels is less clearly defined.
	
In March, 2013 the issue of flag state liability for IUU fishing was brought before the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in a request for an advisory opinion submitted by the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission (SRFC) of West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no.21/advisory_opinion/C21_AdvOp_02.04.pdf] "Request for an Advisory Opinion Submitted by the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission (SRFC)" &lt;/ref&gt; The SRFC asked the Tribunal to advise on the following four questions:

# What are the obligations of the flag State in cases where illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities are conducted within the Exclusive Economic Zone of third party States? 
# To what extent shall the flag State be held liable for IUU fishing activities conducted by vessels sailing under its flag? 
# Where a fishing license is issued to a vessel within the framework of an international agreement with the flag State or with an international agency, shall the State or international agency be held liable for the violation of the fisheries legislation of the coastal State by the vessel in question? 
# What are the rights and obligations of the coastal State in ensuring the sustainable management of shared stocks and stocks of common interest, especially the small pelagic species and tuna? 

In its submissions to the Tribunal, the SRFC emphasized the severity of the IUU fishing problem in West Africa and the need for a clear regime of flag state responsibilities with respect to vessels engaged in this trade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no.21/written_statements_round1/C21_19_CSRP_orig_Eng_rev.pdf] "Written Statement of the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission" &lt;/ref&gt; The SRFC argued that its member states had been unable to mount successful prosecutions against IUU fishers following boardings due to a lack of support and cooperation from flag states.
	
A number of states and international organizations also made submissions&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itlos.org/en/cases/list-of-cases/case-no-21/#c2272]&lt;/ref&gt; adopting a range positions with respect to the four questions above. It was held by some states that the Tribunal lacked the advisory jurisdiction to respond to these questions. Both the government of Spain, a major contributor to the problem of IUU fishing, as well as the United Kingdom adopted such a view. A number of other states took the position that flag state responsibility for IUU fishing should take the form of a general responsibility to perform due diligence with respect to vessels and their activities, rather than an obligation to assist in prosecutions or another more substantive requirement.
	
In its Advisory Opinion&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no.21/advisory_opinion/C21_AdvOp_02.04.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; issued on April 2, 2015, the Tribunal adopted the  “due diligence” approach. The Tribunal found that flag states are under only a general obligation to take the necessary measures to ensure that their nationals and vessels flying their flag are not engaged in IUU fishing activities. This obligation may be satisfied by adhering to generally accepted international norms of fishing vessel regulation and complying with international treaties that indicate best practices. At the same time, the Tribunal found that in coastal waters the coastal state bears primary responsibility for preventing IUU fishing and not the flag state.

==Political processes==
===EU action plan===
The [[European Union|EU]] helped draw up FAO's international plan of action to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing, endorsed by the FAO Council in June 2001. The EU then developed its own plan to implement the commitments agreed at international level, and the European Commission‘s action plan for the eradication of IUU fishing was published in May 2002. It is intended to be implemented at four levels:

At the EU level, more responsibility will be requested with regard to member state nationals acting under a [[flag of convenience]]. Moreover, market measures concerning fisheries products caught in violation of the international agreements will be adopted. In addition, information actions addressed to the fishing industry, consumers, and the public will be launched to raise their awareness.

In the framework of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, control and inspection plans would be adopted as well as specific conservation and management measures. In addition IUU vessels would be identified and monitored and their catches would be quantified.

At the international level, concepts like genuine link would be defined, and a number of rights and obligations of the port state would be established. Moreover, the exchange of information on IUU activities and the international co-operation would be strengthened.

In partnership with developing countries, the necessary means would be provided to enable them to effectively control fishing activities undertaken in waters under their jurisdiction.

===High Seas Task Force===
The [[WCPA High Seas Task Force|High Seas Task Force]] comprises a group of fisheries ministers and international NGOs working together to develop an action plan designed to combat IUU fishing on the high seas.

Launched in 2003, the Task Force includes fisheries ministers from Australia, Canada, Chile, Namibia, New Zealand and the UK, together with the [[Earth Institute]], [[IUCN]]-World Conservation Union, [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] International and the [[Marine Stewardship Council]].

The goal of the Task Force is to set priorities among a series of practical proposals for confronting the challenge of IUU fishing on the high seas. A series of expert panels have been convened to identify the legal, economic, scientific and enforcement factors that permit IUU activity to thrive, and then determine key points of leverage that can brought to bear at national, regional, and global levels to minimise the incentives to carry out IUU fishing on the high seas. The completed action plan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.high-seas.org/docs/HSTFfinal/HSTF-Final-Report-09-03-06.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; published on 3 March 2006, will be placed by ministerial members of the Task Force directly in the hands of other ministers.

=== Regional Fisheries Management Organizations ===
[[Regional Fisheries Management Organisation]]s (RFMOs) are affiliations of nations that co-ordinate efforts to manage fisheries in a particular region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=4566&lt;/ref&gt;

RFMOs may focus on certain species of fish (e.g. the Commission for the Conservation of [[Southern bluefin tuna]]) or have a wider remit related to living marine resources in general within a region (e.g. the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources ([[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources|CCAMLR]])). This wide diversity of mandates and areas of application, and also effective implementation of regulations, opens up opportunities for IUU vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/fi/website/FIRetrieveAction.do?dom=topic&amp;fid=2940 FAO website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===UN high seas processes===

The present system of high seas governance has evolved over a period of several hundred years, the end result being a [[patchwork quilt]] of measures in the form of binding and non-binding instruments with different geographical and legal reaches and different levels of participation.

Most legal instruments build on the foundation established by the UN [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Convention on the Law of the Sea]], which was agreed in 1982 and entered into force in 1992.

The UN Fish Stocks Agreement, which entered into force in 2001, sets out principles for the conservation and management of fish stocks and establishes that such management must be based on the precautionary approach and the best available scientific information. The Agreement provides a framework for cooperation on conservation and management, but since only about a third of the parties to the Law of the Sea Convention have ratified it, its impact is inevitably limited.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) carries out much of the technical work on international fisheries management, and provides a forum for the negotiation of agreements and codes of conduct. In 1995 the FAO agreed its [[Code of Conduct]] for Responsible Fisheries to promote long-term [[sustainable management]].

In 2001, the FAO adopted the International Plan of Action (IPOA) on IUU Fishing. The aim of this voluntary instrument is to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing by providing all states with comprehensive, effective and transparent measures by which to act, including through appropriate regional fisheries management organisations established in accordance with international law.

The FAO Compliance Agreement, which entered into force in 2003, is designed to close a major loophole in international fisheries management, that of the circumvention of fisheries regulations by ‘re-flagging‘ vessels under the flags of states that are unable or unwilling to enforce such measures.

In 2009, the FAO brokered the [[Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing]], which entered into force in 2016. The agreement closes ports to vessels suspected of illegal fishing.&lt;ref name=MercoPress/&gt; The treaty requires that fishing vessels request permission to dock and inform the port of the details of its fishing operations. Permission to dock can be denied if unregulated fishing was occurring. The measure is intended to block illegally caught fish from entering the marketplace. Other measures in the treaty include inspections of equipment, paperwork, catches, and ship's records. Though the treaty does not compel countries to apply these measures to ships under their own flags, they may choose to do so under the agreement.&lt;ref name=MercoPress&gt;{{cite news | title = FAO: New treaty will leave fish pirates without safe haven | url = http://en.mercopress.com/2009/09/01/fao1 | date = 2009-09-01 | publisher = [[MercoPress]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 91 countries agree to illegal fishing treaty | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jozF6o3ZudxKjNHdVnaj8w7cOVHQD9AEO9Q82 | publisher = The Associated Press | date = 2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Location Managers Guild International Awards''' are awarded at an annual show honoring outstanding contributions to location scouting in the film and television industries. The [[Location Managers Guild International|Location Managers Guild]] held its inaugural show in March 2014 at the [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers Guild]] Theater in Beverly Hills, with honors going to Location Managers Robert Boake ''([[Game of Thrones]])'', Ilt Jones ''([[Iron Man 3]])'', David Doumeng &amp; Charlie Love ''([[Nike, Inc.|Nike]])'', and the Albuquerque Film Commission ''([[Breaking Bad]])''.&lt;ref name="LMGA 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johns|first1=Nikara|title=Location Managers Guild Sets Inaugural Awards|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/awards/location-managers-guild-sets-inaugural-awards-1201122514/|accessdate=2014-12-11|publisher=''Variety''|date=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of its first year, the LMGI has since continued to honor the outstanding creative contributions of location professionals around the world annually, currently held in conjunction with the [[Association of Film Commissioners International#AFCI Locations Show|AFCI Location Show]] in Los Angeles, CA.

Originally called the ''LMGA Awards'', the name of the awards changed with the guild's name change to reflect the international nature of filmmaking to the ''LMGI Awards'' in 2016.

In addition to the awards given for the best location professional in film, television, commercials, and [[film commission]], the LMGI presents honorary awards to a location professional for lifetime achievement, to a trailblazer who has been a leader in furthering the recognition of location professionals in motion picture and television, a humanitarian award, and the [[Eva Monley]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://locationmanagers.org/about-the-lmga-eva-monley-honorary-award "About the Eva Monley Award"] ''Location Managers Guild of America'' Retrieved 2014-12-11&lt;/ref&gt; award for an entertainment industry professional that has demonstrated 'above and beyond' support of the work of location professionals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3845">'''Louise Crane''' (November 11, 1913 – October 20, 1997), a prominent American philanthropist. Crane was a friend to some of [[New York City]]’s leading literary figures, including [[Tennessee Williams]] and [[Marianne Moore]]. 

[[File:Driftwood, Woods Hole, MA.jpg|thumb|left|267px|"Driftwood", [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]], one of the residences of Crane and [[Victoria Kent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://drs.library.yale.edu/HLTransformer/HLTransServlet?stylename=yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&amp;pid=beinecke:cranel&amp;clear-stylesheet-cache=yes|title=Louise Crane and Victoria Kent papers | year=1999 |website=Yale University Library |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Crane's father was [[Winthrop Murray Crane]], an American millionaire and former governor of [[Massachusetts]]. Her mother was [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) co-founder [[Josephine Porter Boardman]]. Louise smoothly moved into the role of patron of the arts. She was a prominent supporter of jazz and orchestral music, initiating a series of "coffee concerts" at MoMA and commissioning a vocal and orchestral work by [[Lukas Foss]]. She represented musicians, including [[Mary Lou Williams]]. Crane collaborated also with her mother in sponsoring musical works.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Crane met [[Elizabeth Bishop]] while classmates together at [[Vassar College|Vassar]] in 1930. The pair traveled extensively in Europe and bought a house together in 1937 in [[Key West, Florida]]. While Bishop lived in Key West, Crane occasionally returned to New York. Crane developed a passionate interest in [[Billie Holiday]] in 1941.

[[File:820 Fifth Avenue.jpg|thumb|upright|820 Fifth Avenue, Crane lived here in a luxury co-op for many years]]

Crane published ''Ibérica'', a Spanish-language review, with her partner, [[Victoria Kent]], from 1954 to 1974. ''Ibérica'' featured news for the expatriate Spanish community in the United States. Kent was a prominent member of the Spanish Republican party, opposed to Franco. Many prominent writers, including [[Salvador Madariaga]], contributed to ''Ibérica''. 

Following her mother's death in 1972, Crane and Kent lived together in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]], and [[Redding, Connecticut]]. Crane was the executor of [[Marianne Moore|Marianne Moore's]] estate after her death in 1972.

Crane lived for years in an 18-room apartment on the fourth floor of the 820 Fifth Avenue building, a luxury cooperative in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Located at the northeast corner of East 63rd Street on the Upper East Side, the 12 story limestone-clad was designed in the [[Italian Renaissance Revival architecture|neo-Italian Renaissance palazzo style]] by [[Starrett &amp; van Vleck]], and was built by Fred T. Ley in 1916. The fourth floor is one of only a few units in the building which have changed hands multiple times in the last 10 or 20 years. After Crane’s death in 1997, the apartment was sold to [[Tommy Hilfiger]] for around $10,000,000.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://drs.library.yale.edu/HLTransformer/HLTransServlet?stylename=yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&amp;pid=beinecke:cranel&amp;clear-stylesheet-cache=yes "Guide to the Louise Crane and Victoria Kent Papers YCAL MSS 473"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crane and Kent are buried alongside each other at Umpawaug Cemetery, [[Redding, Connecticut]].

'''Léon Eyrolles''' (14 December 1861 in [[Tulle]] &amp;ndash; 3 December 1945 in [[Cachan]]?) was a French politician and entrepreneur. In 1891 he created the first [[École Spéciale des Travaux Publics]] and later a [[correspondence school]].

Eyrolles developed his educative skills as he helped fellow [[site manager]]s to pass civil servant selective exams. In 1902 he bought a large piece of land to extend the school and in 1924 he became the mayor of the newly founded city of [[Cachan]] which was split from the city of [[Arcueil]].

'''Meta marketing''' is "the synthesis of all [[Management|managerial]], [[Tradition|traditional]], [[Scientific method|scientific]], social and historical foundations of [[marketing]],” a term first coined by E.J.Kelly while discussing the issue of [[ethics]] and science of marketing &lt;ref&gt;Modern Marketing- Principles &amp; Practice by Chandra Bose {{ISBN|978-81-203-3945-3}} Yr of publishing- 2010, Publisher- PHI Learning Private Limited, New Delhi, Page no. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Meta Marketing is an attempt to widen the horizons of marketing by covering [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organisations]]. The best examples of Meta Marketing can be selling family planning ideas or the idea of prohibition.
 
A Meta market will bring all buyers and sellers in one place for one purpose only. Instead of giving multiple products to one customer, a Meta market brings together different customers who need not necessarily differentiate between closely related products.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketing91.com/meta-markets/&lt;/ref&gt;
Meta market is thus, a place, where everything connected with a certain market can be found. Let’s say a car selling in a Meta market would be a website, that sells cars but you will also find car parts there, add-ons for cars, colours for cars, mechanic’s reviews, etc. So Meta market of a certain market is a market, where you can find everything about that market and everything about markets that are strongly connected to that market.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sayeconomy.com/what-is-meta-market/]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Meta marketing is an approach to the study of marketing and its relationship to every aspect of life by focussing on all social, ethical, scientific and business experience in marketing, thus establishing a body of knowledge base on the integration of every facet of experience with the human personality.&lt;ref&gt;144, Marketing Worterbuch Marketing Dictionary by Wolfgang J. Koshnick, Yr-2000, Walter De Gruyter, GmbH&amp;Co., Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be two different ideologies associated with meta-marketing. One, as described above, is essentially bringing together closely related industries under one umbrella industry and the other is as follows:

Even today, marketing is seen by many a [[CEO]] as a post-manufacturing activity, simply because all the elements (packaging, branding, distribution, [[selling]], [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]]), take place usually after the basic product is made. A hangover has remained of a product centred, rather than the consumer-centred frame of mind.

Until the Seventies, industrialists spent considerably more effort and money in deciding the investment in plant and machinery rather than the intricacies of marketing. Often, investment decisions were made pre-manufacturing of the product and hence, they failed to realise that the full potential of a product being sold can be maximised for customers not just by merely design and application, but also by integrating closely related products into one industry as a whole.

Also, the growth phase of many industries acted as a contributing factor as each product, no matter of what category was selling like hot-cakes. However, today, the situation has changed vastly. It’s all about mapping the customer’s brain and competitor’s strategies.

Today, understanding and considering the environment in which the industry operates has also become increasingly important. Business policy makers have, of late, made it very evident that there is a need for a strategic intent and a single-minded focus on the industry.

Also, both corporate and marketing strategy thinkers, as well as consultants, are rediscovering the need to "reshape the industry." It can be related to what [[Joseph Schumpeter]] of the [[Austrian School]] of economics discovered a long time ago namely, that the central component and the driving force behind industry evolution was [[Innovation]].

A meta-marketing thinker never replicates the [[marketing mix]] of the market leader or predecessor. Going as far away as possible from the "success secret" may be a less dangerous route to take. This version of Meta Marketing says that it is better to do something different, rather than follow what the industry is doing.

As S. Ramachander highlights, “such insight inevitably precedes creating a new competitive paradigm, including rewriting the rulebook itself and changing the rules of the game. In an increasingly competitive and transnational arena, marketing companies will have to ponder more and more about not just an offering that is different or better, but one that is an expression of a marketing insight.” &lt;ref&gt;From Marketing to Meta Marketing by S. Ramachander, Special issue with the Sunday Magazine, From the publishers of THE HINDU -TRANSITIONS: September 12, 1999,"[http://www.hindu.com/folio/fo9909/99090204.jpg]"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moon Kook-hyun''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 문국현, [[Hanja]]: 文國現, born 12 January 1949) is the leader of the [[Creative Korea Party]], who served as a well-known [[Chief Executive Officer|business manager]] and civil [[Environmentalism|environmental]] campaigner in [[South Korea]] before entering his political career.

Born in [[Seoul]], Moon studied [[English language]] at the [[Hankuk University of Foreign Studies]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1972, then took a postgraduate course in [[Business Administration]] at the [[Seoul National University]].&lt;ref name="chosun"&gt;"[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200101/200101190405.html Moon Kook-hyun, CEO Of Yuhan-Kimberly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108222757/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200101/200101190405.html |date=2009-01-08 }}", ''[[Chosun Ilbo]]'', 19 January 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a Business Leader ==
Moon began his career at [[Yuhan-Kimberly]]([[:ko:유한킴벌리|유한킴벌리]]), a company manufacturing [[paper]] and woven fibre products.  In 1983, he spent a year in the [[United States]], taking some new management concepts.  On his return, he developed the concept of "environmental management", focusing on [[digital printing]] technologies and the use of [[recycled paper]].&lt;ref name="chosun" /&gt;

In 1995, Moon became [[Chief Executive Officer]] of Yuhan-Kimberly.  In 1996, Moon was appointed committee director of the U.N. Environment (UNEP) Korea Development Organization.  Faced with a financial crisis in 1997, he developed a new [[shift work|shift]] system where workers worked twelve-hours shifts for four days running, then took four days off.&lt;ref name="chosun" /&gt;

==2007 Presidential Election==
In August 2007, Moon resigned from Yuhan-Kimberly to run in the [[South Korean presidential election, 2007]].  In October, he formed the [[Creative Korea Party]], with an [[Political corruption|anti-corruption]], pro-environmentalist program, gaining a bit of support from liberal voters who supported the [[Roh Moo-hyun|Participatory Government]], conservative voters who wanted to change the government and liked a similar 'business leader' portfolio but disliked [[Lee Myung-bak]], and from the [[labor movement]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2007/10/30/14/0301000000AEN20071030007800315F.HTML Dark horse presidential candidate launches party ahead of election]", [[Yonhap|Yonhap News Agency]], 30 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the election, Moon won 5.8% of the votes for fourth place. Moon is a Roman Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moon21.kr/moon/profile.php 문국현 소개]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 Legislative Election==
On April 9, 2008, Moon beat the close confidante of [[Lee Myung-bak]] (president) [[Lee Jae-oh]] ([[Grand National Party|GNP]], [[Incumbent]]), by more than 11%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/04/116_22230.html Rise and Fall of Heavyweights], the Korea Times, Retrieved on April 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Although the harsh loss of South Korean liberal candidates especially in Seoul at this [[South Korean parliamentary election, 2008|2008 election]], his campaign against 'the Grand Korean Canal' project boosted his popularity in his electoral division and across the nation.

{{Objectivist movement}}

'''Objectivism''' is a [[philosophical system]] developed by [[Russian Americans|Russian-American]] writer [[Ayn Rand]]. Rand first expressed Objectivism in her fiction, most notably ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' (1943) and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' (1957), and later in non-fiction essays and books.&lt;ref name="Badhwar 2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Badhwar|Long|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Peikoff]], a professional philosopher and Rand's designated intellectual heir,&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Authors Online'', s.v. "Leonard Peikoff." Accessed March 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McLemee"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McLemee |first=Scott |url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9909/rand.html |title=The Heirs Of Ayn Rand: Has Objectivism Gone Subjective? |journal=[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]] |date=September 1999 |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=45–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; later gave it a more formal structure. Rand described Objectivism as "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute".&lt;ref&gt;"About the Author" in {{harvnb|Rand|1992|pp=1170–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peikoff characterizes Objectivism as a "closed system" that is not subject to change.&lt;ref name="Fact and Value" /&gt;

Objectivism's central tenets are that [[reality]] exists independently of [[consciousness]], that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception (see ''[[Direct and indirect realism]]''), that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of [[concept]] formation and [[inductive logic]], that the proper [[morality|moral]] purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness (see ''[[Rational egoism]]''), that the only [[social system]] consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for [[Individual and group rights|individual rights]] embodied in ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]], and that the role of [[art]] in human life is to transform humans' [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form—a work of art—that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally.

Academic philosophers have mostly ignored or rejected Rand's philosophy.&lt;ref name="academic"&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|2013|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Badhwar|Long|2012}}; {{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Machan|2000|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Heyl|1995|p=223}}; {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1984|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Objectivism has been a significant influence among [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarians]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]].&lt;ref name="politicalinfluence"&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=107–08, 124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Objectivist movement]], which Rand founded, attempts to spread her ideas to the public and in academic settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Rand originally expressed her philosophical ideas in her novels, most notably, ''The Fountainhead'' and ''Atlas Shrugged''. She further elaborated on them in her periodicals ''[[The Objectivist Newsletter]]'', ''[[The Objectivist]]'', and ''[[Objectivist periodicals#The Ayn Rand Letter|The Ayn Rand Letter]]'', and in non-fiction books such as ''[[Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology]]'' and ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]''.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;{{cite news |first=Harriet |last=Rubin |title=Ayn Rand's Literature of Capitalism |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/15/business/15atlas.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=September 15, 2007 |accessdate=September 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Objectivism" derives from the idea that human knowledge and values are [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]: they exist and are determined by the nature of reality, to be discovered by one's mind, and are not created by the thoughts one has.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1967|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand stated that she chose the name because her preferred term for a philosophy based on the primacy of [[existence]]—"[[existentialism]]"—had already been taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand characterized Objectivism as "a philosophy for living on earth", grounded in reality, and aimed at defining human nature and the nature of the world in which we live.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;

|sign=Ayn Rand, ''Atlas Shrugged''&lt;ref&gt;"About the Author" in {{harvnb|Rand|1992|pp=1170–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Metaphysics: objective reality===
Rand's philosophy begins with three [[axiom]]s: existence, consciousness, and [[Law of identity|identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=4–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand defined an axiom as "a statement that identifies the base of knowledge and of any further statement pertaining to that knowledge, a statement necessarily contained in all others whether any particular speaker chooses to identify it or not. An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1040}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Objectivist philosopher [[Leonard Peikoff]] argued, Rand's argument for axioms "is not a proof that the axioms of existence, consciousness, and identity are true. It is proof that they are ''axioms'', that they are at the base of knowledge and thus inescapable."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand held that ''existence'' is the perceptually self-evident fact at the base of all other knowledge, i.e., that "existence exists." She further held that to be is to be ''something'', that "existence ''is'' identity." That is, to be is to be "an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes." That which has no nature or attributes does not and cannot exist. The axiom of existence is grasped in differentiating something from nothing, while the law of identity is grasped in differentiating one thing from another, i.e., one's first awareness of the law of non-contradiction, another crucial base for the rest of knowledge. As Rand wrote, "A leaf ... cannot be all red and green at the same time, it cannot freeze and burn at the same time... [[A is A]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivism rejects belief in anything alleged to transcend existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand argued that consciousness is "the faculty of perceiving that which exists." As she put it, "to be conscious is to be conscious of ''something''", that is consciousness itself cannot be distinguished or grasped except in relation to an independent reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It cannot be aware only of itself—there is no 'itself' until it is aware of something."&lt;ref name="Gotthelf"&gt;{{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Objectivism holds that the mind does not create reality, but rather, it is a means of discovering reality.&lt;ref name="ITOE"&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressed differently, existence has "primacy" over consciousness, which must conform to it. Any other approach Rand termed "the primacy of consciousness", including any variant of metaphysical subjectivism or theism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|pp=24–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivist philosophy derives its explanations of action and [[Causality|causation]] from the axiom of identity, calling causation "the law of identity applied to action."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1037}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rand, it is entities that act, and every action is the action of an [[entity]]. The way entities act is caused by the specific nature (or "identity") of those entities; if they were different they would act differently. As with the other axioms, an implicit understanding of causation is derived from one's primary observations of causal connections among entities even before it is verbally identified, and serves as the basis of further knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemology: reason===
According to Rand, attaining knowledge beyond what is given in perception requires both [[volition (psychology)|volition]] (or the exercise of [[free will]]) and adherence to a specific method of validation through observation, concept-formation, and the application of [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[deductive reasoning]]. For example, a belief in dragons, however sincere, does not mean reality contains any dragons. A process of proof identifying the basis in reality of a claimed item of knowledge is necessary to establish its truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=116–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivist [[epistemology]] begins with the principle that "consciousness is identification". This is understood to be a direct consequence of the metaphysical principle that "existence is identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1961|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand defined "reason" as "the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Says Rand, "The fundamental concept of method, the one on which all the others depend, is [[logic]]. The distinguishing characteristic of logic (the art of non-contradictory identification) indicates the nature of the actions (actions of consciousness required to achieve a correct identification) and their goal (knowledge)—while omitting the length, complexity or specific steps of the process of logical inference, as well as the nature of the particular cognitive problem involved in any given instance of using logic."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rand, [[consciousness]] possesses a specific and finite identity, just like everything else that exists; therefore, it must operate by a specific method of validation. An item of knowledge cannot be "disqualified" by being arrived at by a specific process in a particular form. Thus, for Rand, the fact that consciousness must itself possess identity implies the rejection of both universal skepticism based on the "limits" of consciousness, as well as any claim to revelation, emotion or faith based belief.

Objectivist epistemology maintains that all knowledge is ultimately based on perception. "Percepts, not sensations, are the given, the self-evident."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand considered the validity of the senses to be axiomatic, and claimed that purported arguments to the contrary all commit the fallacy of the "stolen concept"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Branden |first=Nathaniel |date=January 1963 |title=The Stolen Concept |journal=The Objectivist Newsletter |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; by presupposing the validity of concepts that, in turn, presuppose the validity of the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She held that perception, being physiologically determined, is incapable of error. For example, [[optical illusion]]s are errors in the conceptual identification of what is seen, not errors in sight itself.&lt;ref name="Kelley 1986"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelley|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of sense perception, therefore, is not susceptible to proof (because it is presupposed by all proof as proof is only a matter of adducing sensory evidence) nor should its validity be denied (since the conceptual tools one would have to use to do this are derived from sensory data). Perceptual error, therefore, is not possible. Rand consequently rejected [[philosophical skepticism|epistemological skepticism]], as she holds that the skeptics' claim to knowledge "distorted" by the form or the means of perception is impossible.&lt;ref name="Kelley 1986"/&gt;

The Objectivist theory of perception distinguishes between the ''form'' and ''object.'' The form in which an organism perceives is determined by the physiology of its sensory systems. Whatever form the organism perceives it in, what it perceives—the object of perception—is reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelley|1986}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=44–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand consequently rejected the [[Kantianism|Kantian]] dichotomy between "things as we perceive them" and "things as they are in themselves." Says Rand, "The attack on man's consciousness and particularly on his conceptual faculty has rested on the unchallenged premise that any knowledge acquired by a ''process'' of consciousness is necessarily subjective and cannot correspond to the facts of reality, since it is ''"processed'' knowledge...[but] all knowledge ''is'' processed knowledge—whether on the sensory, perceptual or conceptual level. An "unprocessed" knowledge would be a knowledge acquired without means of cognition."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of epistemology given the most elaboration by Rand is the theory of concept-formation, which she presented in ''[[Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology]]''. She argued that concepts are formed by a process of measurement omission. Peikoff described her view as follows:

{{quote|To form a concept, one mentally ''isolates'' a group of concretes (of distinct perceptual units), on the basis of observed similarities which distinguish them from all other known concretes (similarity is 'the relationship between two or more existents which possess the same characteristic(s), but in different measure or degree'); then, by a process of omitting the particular measurements of these concretes, one ''integrates'' them into a single new mental unit: the concept, which subsumes all concretes of this kind (a potentially unlimited number). The integration is completed and retained by the selection of a perceptual symbol (a word) to designate it. "A concept is a mental integration of two or more units possessing the same distinguishing characteristic(s), with their particular measurements omitted."&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard. "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy." in {{harvnb|Rand|1990|pp=97–98}}. The quotes within this passage are of Rand's material elsewhere in the same book.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Rand, "[T]he term 'measurements omitted' does not mean, in this context, that measurements are regarded as non-existent; it means that ''measurements exist, but are not specified''. That measurements ''must'' exist is an essential part of the process. The principle is: the relevant measurements must exist in ''some'' quantity, but may exist in ''any'' quantity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=12}}; for more on Rand's theory of concepts see also Kelley, David "A Theory of Abstraction" and "The Psychology of Abstraction", ''Cognition and Brain Theory'' vol. vii, no. 3 and 4 (Summer/Fall 1984), and Rasmussen, Douglas B., "Quine and Aristotelian Essentialism," ''The New Scholasticism'' 58 (Summer, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand argued that concepts are hierarchically organized. Concepts such as 'dog,' which bring together "concretes" available in perception, can be differentiated (into the concepts of 'dachshund,' 'poodle,' etc.) or integrated (along with 'cat,' etc., into the concept of 'animal'). Abstract concepts such as 'animal' can be further integrated, via "abstraction from abstractions", into such concepts as 'living thing.' Concepts are formed in the context of knowledge available. A young child differentiates dogs from cats and chickens, but need not explicitly differentiate them from deep-sea tube worms, or from other types of animals not yet known to him, to form a concept 'dog.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|pp=15–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its view of concepts as "open-ended" classifications that go well beyond the characteristics included in their past or current definitions, Objectivist epistemology rejects the [[Analytic–synthetic distinction|analytic-synthetic distinction]] as a false dichotomy&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard. "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy," in {{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; and denies the possibility of ''[[a priori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard. "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy". in {{harvnb|Rand|1990|pp=116–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand rejected "feeling" as sources of knowledge. Rand acknowledged the importance of emotion for human beings, but she maintained that emotions are a consequence of the conscious or subconscious ideas that a person already accepts, not a means of achieving awareness of reality. "Emotions are not tools of cognition."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1961|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand also rejected all forms of [[faith]] or mysticism, terms that she used synonymously. She defined faith as "the acceptance of allegations without evidence or proof, either apart from or ''against'' the evidence of one's senses and reason... Mysticism is the claim to some non-sensory, non-rational, non-definable, non-identifiable means of knowledge, such as 'instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reliance on revelation is like reliance on a [[Ouija|Ouija board]]; it bypasses the need to show how it connects its results to reality. Faith, for Rand, is not a "short-cut" to knowledge, but a "short-circuit" destroying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1961|p=223}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=182–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivism acknowledges the facts that human beings have limited knowledge, are vulnerable to error, and do not instantly understand all of the implications of their knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Lecture by Leonard Peikoff, cited in {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peikoff, one can be certain of a proposition if all of the available evidence supports it, i.e., it can be logically integrated with the rest of one's knowledge; one is then certain within the context of the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=171–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand rejected the traditional [[rationalism|rationalist]]/[[empiricism|empiricist]] dichotomy, arguing that it embodies a false alternative: conceptually-based knowledge independent of perception (rationalism) versus perceptually-based knowledge independent of concepts (empiricism). Rand argued that neither is possible because the senses provide the material of knowledge while conceptual processing is also needed to establish knowable propositions.

====Criticisms on epistemology====
The philosopher [[John Hospers]], who was influenced by Rand and shared her moral and political views, disagreed with her over issues of epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1987|p=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some philosophers, such as [[Tibor Machan]], have argued that the Objectivist epistemology is incomplete.&lt;ref name="tiborneedwork"&gt;For example, {{harvnb|Machan|2000|pp=134–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychology professor Robert L. Campbell says the relationship between Objectivist epistemology and cognitive science remains unclear because Rand made claims about human cognition and its development which belong to psychology, yet Rand also argued that philosophy is logically prior to psychology and in no way dependent on it.&lt;ref name="itoephilpsych"&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cogrev"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=R.

The philosophers Randall Dipert and [[Roderick Long]] have argued that Objectivist epistemology conflates the perceptual process by which judgments are formed with the way in which they are to be justified, thereby leaving it unclear how sensory data can validate propositionally structured judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dipert |first=Randall R. |date=Spring 1987 |title=Review Essay: David Kelley's ''Evidence of the Senses: A Realist Theory of Perception'' |journal=Reason Papers |issue=12 |pages=57–70 |url=http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/12/rp_12_7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reason and Value: Rand versus Aristotle |last=Long |first=Roderick T. |authorlink=Roderick Long |location=Poughkeepsie, New York |publisher=The Objectivist Center |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-57724-045-7 |oclc=49875339 |series=Objectivist Studies Monographs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivism includes an extensive treatment of ethical concerns. Rand wrote on morality in her works ''The Virtue of Selfishness,'' ''We the Living,'' and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. Rand defines morality as "a code of values to guide man's choices and actions—the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his life."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand maintained that the first question is not what should the code of values be, the first question is "Does man need values at all—and why?" According to Rand, "it is only the concept of 'Life' that makes the concept of 'Value' possible," and, "the fact that a living entity ''is'', determines what it ''ought'' to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=18}}; for more on Rand's metaethics see {{harvnb|Binswanger|1990|pp=58–66}}, {{harvnb|Smith|2000}} and {{harvnb|Gotthelf|Lennox|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand writes: "there is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence or non-existence—and it pertains to a single class of entities: to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence of life is not: it depends on a specific course of action... It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or death..."

Rand argued that the primary focus of man's [[free will]] is in the choice: 'to think or not to think'. "Thinking is not an automatic function. In any hour and issue of his life, man is free to think or to evade that effort. Thinking requires a state of full, focused awareness. The act of focusing one's consciousness is volitional. Man can focus his mind to a full, active, purposefully directed awareness of reality—or he can unfocus it and let himself drift in a semiconscious daze, merely reacting to any chance stimulus of the immediate moment, at the mercy of his undirected sensory-perceptual mechanism and of any random, associational connections it might happen to make."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=22}}; for more on Rand's theory of volition, see {{harvnb|Binswanger|1991}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1969}}; and {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=55–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rand, therefore, possessing free will, human beings must ''choose'' their values: one does not ''automatically'' hold one's own life as his ultimate value. Whether in fact a person's actions promote and fulfill his own life or not is a question of fact, as it is with all other organisms, but whether a person will act to promote his well-being is up to him, not hard-wired into his physiology. "Man has the power to act as his own destroyer—and that is the way he has acted through most of his history."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Says Rand, "Man's mind is his basic tool of survival. Life is given to him, survival is not. His body is given to him, its sustenance is not. His mind is given to him, its content is not. To remain alive he must act and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action. He cannot obtain his food without knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it. He cannot dig a ditch—or build a cyclotron—without a knowledge of his aim and the means to achieve it. To remain alive, he must think."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her novels, ''The Fountainhead'' and ''Atlas Shrugged'', she also emphasizes the central importance of productive work, romantic love and art to human happiness, and dramatizes the ethical character of their pursuit. The primary virtue in Objectivist ethics is [[rationality]], as Rand meant it "the recognition and acceptance of reason as one's only source of knowledge, one's only judge of values and one's only guide to action."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of a moral code, Rand held, is to provide the principles by reference to which man can achieve the values his survival requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand summarizes:

{{quote|If [man] chooses to live, a rational ethics will tell him what principles of action are required to implement his choice. If he does not choose to live, nature will take its course. Reality confronts a man with a great many "must's", but all of them are conditional: the formula of realistic necessity is: "you must, if&amp;nbsp;–" and the if stands for man's choice: "if you want to achieve a certain goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|pp=118–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rand's explanation of values presents the view that an individual's primary moral obligation is to achieve his own well-being—it is for his life and his self-interest that an individual ought to adhere to a moral code.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2006|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethical egoism]] is a corollary of setting man's life as the moral standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand believed that rational egoism is the [[logical consequence]] of humans following evidence wherever it leads them. The only alternative would be that they live without orientation to reality.

A corollary to Rand's endorsement of self-interest is her rejection of the [[Altruism (ethics)|ethical doctrine of altruism]]—which she defined in the sense of [[Auguste Comte]]'s altruism (he coined the term), as a moral obligation to live for the sake of others. Rand also rejected subjectivism. A "whim-worshiper" or "hedonist," according to Rand, is not motivated by a desire to live his own human life, but by a wish to live on a sub-human level. Instead of using "that which promotes my (human) life" as his standard of value, he mistakes "that which I (mindlessly happen to) value" for a standard of value, in contradiction of the fact that, existentially, he is a human and therefore rational organism. The "I value" in whim-worship or hedonism can be replaced with "we value," "he values," "they value," or "God values," and still it would remain dissociated from reality. Rand repudiated the equation of rational selfishness with hedonistic or whim-worshiping "selfishness-without-a-self."  She held that the former is good, and the latter evil, and that there is a fundamental difference between them.&lt;ref name="vos"&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Rand, all of the principal [[virtue]]s are applications of the role of reason as man's basic tool of survival: rationality, honesty, justice, independence, integrity, productiveness, and pride—each of which she explains in some detail in "The Objectivist Ethics."&lt;ref&gt;See also {{harvnb|Smith|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of Objectivist ethics is summarized by the oath her ''Atlas Shrugged'' character John Galt adhered to: "I swear—by my life and my love of it—that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms on ethics====
Many philosophers have criticized Objectivist ethics. The philosopher [[Robert Nozick]] argues that Rand's foundational argument in ethics is unsound because it does not explain why someone could not rationally prefer dying and having no values. He argues that her attempt to defend the morality of selfishness is, therefore, an instance of [[begging the question]]. Nozick also argues that Rand's solution to [[David Hume]]'s famous [[is-ought problem]] is unsatisfactory. In response, the philosophers [[Douglas B. Rasmussen]] and [[Douglas Den Uyl]] have argued that Nozick misstated Rand's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ayn Rand and the Is-Ought Problem |last=O'Neil |first=Patrick M. |journal=Journal of Libertarian Studies |date=Spring 1983 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=81–99 |url=https://www.mises.org/sites/default/files/7_1_4_0.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nozick On the Randian Argument |last1=Den Uyl |first1=Douglas |last2=Rasmussen |first2=Douglas |journal=The Personalist |date=April 1978 |volume=59 |pages=184–205}} Reprinted along with Nozick's article in ''Reading Nozick'', J. Paul, ed., 1981, [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles King criticized Rand's example of an indestructible robot to demonstrate the value of life as incorrect and confusing.&lt;ref&gt;King, J. Charles. "Life and the Theory of Value: The Randian Argument Reconsidered" in {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Paul St. F. Blair defended Rand's ethical conclusions, while maintaining that his arguments might not have been approved by Rand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/10/rp_10_7.pdf |title=The Randian Argument Reconsidered: A Reply to Charles King |first=Paul |last=St. F. Blair |journal=Reason Papers |date=Spring 1985 |issue=10 |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics: individual rights and capitalism===
Rand's defense of individual liberty integrates elements from her entire philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=354}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since reason is the means of human knowledge, it is therefore each person's most fundamental means of survival and is necessary to the achievement of values.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|2009|pp=25–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use or threat of [[Force (law)|force]] neutralizes the practical effect of an individual's reason, whether the force originates from the state or from a criminal. According to Rand, "man's mind will not function at the point of a gun."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1967|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the only type of organized human behavior consistent with the operation of reason is that of voluntary cooperation. Persuasion is the method of reason. By its nature, the overtly irrational cannot rely on the use of persuasion and must ultimately resort to force to prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=310–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Rand saw reason and freedom as correlates, just as she saw mysticism and force as corollaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this understanding of the role of reason, Objectivists hold that the initiation of physical force against the will of another is immoral,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=310}}; {{harvnb|Smith|1997|pp=143–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are indirect initiations of force through threats,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1997|pp=150–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; fraud,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; or breach of contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|pp=129–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of defensive or retaliatory force, on the other hand, is appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=126}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivism holds that because the opportunity to use reason without the initiation of force is necessary to achieve moral values, each individual has an inalienable moral [[natural and legal rights|right]] to act as his own judgment directs and to keep the product of his effort. Peikoff, explaining the basis of rights, stated, "In content, as the founding fathers recognized, there is one fundamental right, which has several major derivatives. The fundamental right is the right to life. Its major derivatives are the right to liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=351–52}}. The Objectivist understanding of rights is explored at length in {{harvnb|Smith|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "A 'right' is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man's freedom of action in a social context."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights are specifically understood to be rights to action, not to specific results or objects, and the obligations created by rights are negative in nature: each individual must refrain from violating the rights of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivists reject alternative notions of rights, such as [[positive rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1997|pp=165–82}}; {{harvnb|Touchstone|2006|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[collective rights]], or [[animal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=356–58}}; {{harvnb|Rand|1964|pp=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivism holds that the only social system which fully recognizes individual rights is capitalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1967|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically what Rand described as "full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivism regards capitalism as the social system which is most beneficial to the poor, but does not consider this its primary justification.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=392–395}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, it is the only moral social system. Objectivism maintains that only societies seeking to establish freedom (or free nations) have a right to [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivism views government as "the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control—i.e., under objectively defined laws;" thus, government is both legitimate and critically important&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to protect individual rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|pp=125–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand opposed [[anarchism]] because she saw putting police and courts on the market as an inherent miscarriage of [[justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Objectivism holds that the proper functions of a government are "''the police'', to protect men from criminals—''[[military|the armed services]]'', to protect men from foreign invaders—''[[courts|the law courts]]'', to settle disputes among men according to objectively defined laws," the [[Executive (government)|executive]], and [[legislatures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in protecting individual rights, the government is acting as an agent of its citizens and "has no rights except the rights ''delegated'' to it by the citizens"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it must act in an impartial manner according to specific, objectively defined laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=128}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=364–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Objectivists Peikoff and [[Yaron Brook]] have since expressed support for other government functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peikoff.com/2011/03/07/what-role-should-certain-specific-governments-play-in-objectivist-government/|title=What role should certain specific governments play in Objectivist government?

" Featured Podcast " Peikoff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand argued that limited [[intellectual property rights|intellectual property]] monopolies being granted to certain inventors and artists on a first-to-file basis are moral because she viewed all property as fundamentally intellectual. Furthermore, the value of a commercial product comes in part from the necessary work of its inventors. However, Rand viewed limits on patents and copyrights as important and held that if they were granted in perpetuity, it would necessarily lead to ''de facto'' collectivism.

Rand opposed [[racism]] and any legal application of racism. She considered [[affirmative action]] to be an example of legal racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|pp=173–84}}; ''cf''. {{cite book |title=The Other Side of Racism |last=Wortham |first=Anne |location=Columbus, Ohio |publisher=Ohio State University Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-8142-0318-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand advocated the right to legal [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |chapter=Of Living Death |others=Edited by Leonard Peikoff |title=The Voice of Reason |location=New York |publisher=New American Library |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-453-00634-7|title-link=The Voice of Reason (book) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand believed [[capital punishment]] is morally justified as retribution against a murderer, but dangerous due to the risk of mistakenly executing innocent people and opening the door to state murder. She therefore said she opposed capital punishment "on epistemological, not moral, grounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|2005|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; She opposed involuntary [[military conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1967|pp=226–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She opposed any form of [[censorship]], including legal restrictions on [[pornography]], [[freedom of opinion|opinion]] or [[freedom to worship|worship]], famously quipping; "In the transition to statism, every infringement of human rights has begun with a given right's least attractive practitioners".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|pp=173–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/free_speech.html|title=Free Speech|website=Ayn Rand Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivists have also opposed a number of government activities commonly supported by both liberals and conservatives, including [[antitrust]] laws,&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Alan. "Antitrust" in {{harvnb|Rand|1967|pp=63–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[minimum wage]], [[public education]],&lt;ref&gt;Branden, Nathaniel. "Common Fallacies about Capitalism" in {{harvnb|Rand|1967|pp=89–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and existing [[child labor]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;Hessen, Robert. "The Effects of the Industrial Revolution on Women and Children" in {{harvnb|Rand|1967|pp=110–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivists have argued against [[faith-based initiatives]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?&amp;id=7475 |title=Faith-Based Initiatives Are an Assault on Secular Government |last=Epstein |first=Alex |date=February 4, 2003 |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=June 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; displaying religious symbols in government facilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?&amp;id=10889 |title=The Ten Commandments vs. America |first=Harry |last=Binswanger |date=March 3, 2005 |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=June 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the teaching of "[[intelligent design]]" in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?&amp;id=11555 |title='Intelligent Design' Is about Religion versus Reason |newspaper=Orange County Register |first=Keith |last=Lockitch |date=December 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining that it should be phased out gradually, Rand opposed [[taxation]] as she considered it theft and an endorsement of force over reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand Answers: The Best of Her Q &amp; A&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms on politics====
Some critics, including economists and political philosophers such as, [[Murray Rothbard]], [[David D. Friedman]], [[Roy Childs]], [[Norman P. Barry]], and [[Chandran Kukathas]], have argued that Objectivist ethics are consistent with [[anarcho-capitalism]] instead of [[minarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;Childs, Roy (1969).

===Aesthetics: metaphysical value-judgments===
{{See also|Romantic realism}}
The Objectivist theory of [[art]] flows from its epistemology, by way of "psycho-epistemology" (Rand's term for an individual's characteristic mode of functioning in acquiring knowledge). Art, according to Objectivism, serves a human cognitive need: it allows human beings to grasp concepts as though they were [[percept]]s. Objectivism defines "art" as a "selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments"—that is, according to what the artist believes to be ultimately true and important about the nature of reality and humanity. In this respect Objectivism regards art as a way of presenting abstractions concretely, in perceptual form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human need for art, on this view, stems from the need for cognitive economy. A concept is already a sort of mental shorthand standing for a large number of concretes, allowing a human being to think indirectly or implicitly of many more such concretes than can be held explicitly in mind. But a human being cannot hold indefinitely many concepts explicitly in mind either—and yet, on the Objectivist view, needs a comprehensive conceptual framework to provide guidance in life. Art offers a way out of this dilemma by providing a perceptual, easily grasped means of communicating and thinking about a wide range of abstractions, including one's metaphysical value-judgments. Objectivism regards art as an effective way to communicate a moral or ethical ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=422}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivism does not, however, regard art as propagandistic: even though art involves moral values and ideals, its purpose is not to educate, only to show or project. Moreover, art need not be, and usually is not, the outcome of a full-blown, explicit philosophy. Usually it stems from an artist's ''sense of life'' (which is preconceptual and largely emotional).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end goal of Rand's own artistic endeavors was to portray the ideal man. ''The Fountainhead'' is the best example of this effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barr|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand uses the character of Roark to embody the concept of the higher man which she believes is what great art should do - embody the characteristics of the best of humanity. This higher symbolism should be represented in all art; artistic expression should be an extension of the greatness in humanity.

Rand held that Romanticism was the highest school of literary art, noting that Romanticism was "based on the recognition of the principle that man possesses the faculty of volition," absent which, Rand believed, literature is robbed of dramatic power, adding:

{{quote|What the Romanticists brought to art was the ''primacy of values''... Values are the source of emotions: a great deal of emotional intensity was projected in the work of the Romanticists and in the reactions of their audiences, as well as a great deal of color, imagination, originality, excitement, and all the other consequences of a value-oriented view of life.&lt;ref&gt;"What is Romanticism?" in {{harvnb|Rand|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term "romanticism," however, is often affiliated with emotionalism, to which Objectivism is completely opposed. Historically, many romantic artists were philosophically [[subjectivist]]. Most Objectivists who are also artists subscribe to what they call [[romantic realism]], which is how Rand labeled her own work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Torres|Kamhi|2000|pp=31–32}}; {{harvnb|Holzer|2005|pp=115–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors have developed and applied Rand's ideas in their own work. Rand described Peikoff's ''[[The Ominous Parallels]]'' (1982), as "the first book by an Objectivist philosopher other than myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Peikoff published ''[[Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]]'', a comprehensive exposition of Rand's philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]] discusses Rand's ideas and theorizes about their intellectual origins in ''[[Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical]]'' (1995). Surveys such as ''[[On Ayn Rand]]'' by [[Allan Gotthelf]] (1999), ''Ayn Rand'' by [[Tibor R. Machan]] (2000), and ''Objectivism in One Lesson'' by [[Andrew Bernstein]] (2009) provide briefer introductions to Rand's ideas.

Some scholars have focused on applying Objectivism in more specific areas. Machan has developed Rand's contextual conception of human knowledge (while also drawing on the insights of [[J. L. Austin]] and [[Gilbert Harman]]) in works such as ''Objectivity'' (2004), and [[David Kelley]] has explicated Rand's epistemological ideas in works such as ''The Evidence of the Senses'' (1986) and ''A Theory of Abstraction'' (2001). In the field of ethics, Kelley has argued in works such as ''Unrugged Individualism'' (1996) and ''The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand'' (2000) that Objectivists should pay more attention to the virtue of benevolence and place less emphasis on issues of moral sanction. Kelley's views have been controversial, and critics Peikoff and [[Peter Schwartz (writer)|Peter Schwartz]] have argued that he contradicts important principles of Objectivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1989}}; {{harvnb|Schwartz|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelley has used the term "Open Objectivism" for a version of Objectivism that involves "a commitment to reasoned, non-dogmatic discussion and debate," "the recognition that Objectivism is open to expansion, refinement, and revision," and "a policy of benevolence toward others, including fellow-travelers and critics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlassociety.org/open_objectivism_david_kelley|website=Atlas Society|title=A Note to Our Members About Open Objectivism|date=October 17, 2008|last=Kelley|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing against Kelley, Peikoff characterized Objectivism as a "closed system" that is not subject to change.&lt;ref name="Fact and Value"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fact and Value |journal=The Intellectual Activist |date=May 18, 1989 |volume=5 |issue=1 |first=Leonard |last=Peikoff |url=http://ari.aynrand.org/issues/culture-and-society/religion-and-morality/Fact-and-Value}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An author who focuses on Rand's ethics, [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]], stays closer to Rand's original ideas in such works as ''Moral Rights and Political Freedom'' (1995), ''Viable Values'' (2000), and ''Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comments on Tara Smith's ''Viable Values'' |accessdate=May 29, 2009 |date=December 2000 |url=http://enlightenment.supersaturated.com/essays/text/irfankhawaja/viablevaluescomment.html |first=Irfan |last=Khawaja}}; {{cite journal |title=Egoism Explained: A Review of Tara Smith's ''Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist'' |journal=The Objective Standard |date=Spring 2007 |volume=2 |issue=1 |url=http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2007-spring/egoism-explained.asp |first=Diana |last=Hsieh |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with Peikoff, David Harriman has developed a theory of [[scientific method|scientific]] [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] based upon Rand's theory of concepts in ''The Logical Leap: Induction in Physics'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;Harriman, David, ''The Logical Leap'', 2010, New American Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[political philosophy|political]] aspects of Rand's philosophy are discussed by Bernstein in ''The Capitalist Manifesto'' (2005). In ''Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics'' (1996), [[George Reisman]] attempts to integrate Objectivist methodology and insights with both [[Classical Economics|Classical]] and [[Austrian Economics|Austrian economics]]. In psychology, Professor [[Edwin A. Locke]] and Ellen Kenner have explored Rand's ideas in ''The Selfish Path to Romance: How to Love with Passion &amp; Reason''.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, Edwin, and Kenner, Ellen, Platform, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers have explored the application of Objectivism to fields ranging from [[aesthetics|art]], as in ''What Art Is'' by Louis Torres and [[Michelle Marder Kamhi]] (2000), to [[teleology]], as in ''The Biological Basis of Teleological Concepts'' by [[Harry Binswanger]] (1990).

According to one Rand biographer, most people first read Rand's works in their "formative years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ayn Rand and the World She Made |last=Heller |first=Anne C. |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-385-51399-9 |page=xii|title-link=Ayn Rand and the World She Made }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand's former protégé [[Nathaniel Branden]] referred to Rand's "especially powerful appeal to the young,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Benefits and Hazards of the Philosophy of Ayn Rand: A Personal Statement |first=Nathaniel |last=Branden |journal=[[Journal of Humanistic Psychology]] |date=Fall 1984 |volume=24 |issue=4 |url=http://mol.redbarn.org/objectivism/Writing/NathanielBranden/BenefitsAndHazards.html |pages=29–64 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717195811/http://mol.redbarn.org/objectivism/Writing/NathanielBranden/BenefitsAndHazards.html |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Onkar Ghate of the [[Ayn Rand Institute]] said Rand "appeals to the idealism of youth."&lt;ref name="Ghate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://capitalismmagazine.com/2008/02/the-appeal-of-ayn-rand/ |first=Onkar |last=Ghate |title=The Appeal of Ayn Rand |website=Capitalism Magazine |date=February 2, 2008 |accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appeal has alarmed a number of critics of the philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these young people later abandon their positive view of Rand and are often said to have "outgrown" her ideas.&lt;ref name="Doherty544"&gt;{{cite book |title=Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement |last=Doherty |first=Brian |authorlink=Brian Doherty (journalist) |location=New York |publisher=Public Affairs |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-58648-350-0 |page=544|title-link=Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of Rand's work recognize the phenomenon, but attribute it to the loss of youthful idealism and inability to resist social pressures for intellectual conformity.&lt;ref name="Ghate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doherty544"/&gt; In contrast, historian Jennifer Burns, writing in ''[[Goddess of the Market]]'' (2009), says some critics "dismiss Rand as a shallow thinker appealing only to adolescents," although she thinks the critics "miss her significance" as a "[[gateway drug]]" to [[right-wing politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic philosophers have generally dismissed Objectivism since Rand first presented it.&lt;ref name="academic"/&gt; Objectivism has been called "fiercely anti-academic" because of Rand's criticism of contemporary intellectuals.&lt;ref name="McLemee"/&gt; [[David Sidorsky]], a professor of moral and political philosophy at Columbia University, says Rand's work is "outside the mainstream" and is more of an ideological movement than a well-grounded philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harvey |first=Benjamin |url=http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050515/NEWS/505150346/1014 |title=Ayn Rand at 100: An 'ism' struts its stuff |publisher=''[[Rutland Herald]]'' |date=May 15, 2005 |accessdate=July 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226153815/http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050515%2FNEWS%2F505150346%2F1014# |archive-date=December 26, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; British philosopher [[Ted Honderich]] notes that he deliberately excluded an article on Rand from ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'' (Rand is, however, mentioned in the article on popular philosophy by [[Anthony Quinton, Baron Quinton|Anthony Quinton]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Honderich|2005|pp=x, 740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand is the subject of entries in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'',&lt;ref name="Badhwar 2010"/&gt; ''The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers'',&lt;ref name=dmap&gt;{{harvnb|Salmieri|Gotthelf|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hicks|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Routledge Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Political Thinkers'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevens|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;Mautner, Thomas. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy''. Penguin Books, 2000, p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt; A listing of Rand also appears in the ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', featuring the assessment, "The influence of Rand's ideas was strongest among college students in the USA but attracted little attention from academic philosophers. Her outspoken defense of capitalism in works like ''[[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]]'' (1967), and her characterization of her position as a defence of the 'virtue of selfishness' in her [[The Virtue of Selfishness|essay collection of the same title]] published in 1964, also brought notoriety, but kept her out of the intellectual mainstream."&lt;ref name="Kukathas"&gt;{{harvnb|Kukathas|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades Rand's works are more likely to be encountered in the classroom.&lt;ref name="McLemee"/&gt; The Ayn Rand Society, dedicated to fostering the scholarly study of Objectivism, is affiliated with the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s Eastern Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=386n.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] scholar and Objectivist [[Allan Gotthelf]], late chairman of the Society, and his colleagues argued for more academic study of Objectivism, viewing the philosophy as a unique and intellectually interesting defense of [[classical liberalism]] that is worth debating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Uyl |first=Douglas J.

[[File:British Virgin Islands Companies Registry (2).jpg|thumb|The British Virgin Islands Companies Registry.]]
The term '''"offshore company'''" or '''"offshore corporation'''" is used in at least two distinct and different ways.  An offshore company may be a reference to:
* a company, [[Corporate group|group]] or sometimes a division thereof, which engages in '''[[offshoring]] business processes'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/offshore.asp|title=Definition: offshore|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International business company|International business companies]] (IBC) or other types of [[Legal personality|legal entities]], which are incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction, that prohibits local economic activities.&lt;ref&gt;T.J. van Koningsveld, 2016. De Offshore Wereld Ontmaskerd. Kerckebosch.&lt;/ref&gt;

The former use (companies formed in offshore jurisdictions) is probably the more common usage of the term. In isolated instances the term can also be used in reference to companies with [[Offshore drilling|offshore oil and gas]] operations.

==Companies from offshore jurisdictions==
{{see also|Conduit and Sink OFCs}}
In relation to companies and similar entities which are incorporated in offshore jurisdictions, the use of both the words "offshore" and "company" can be varied in application.

The extent to which a jurisdiction is regarded as offshore is often a question of perception and degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Identifying_Tax_Havens_Jul_07.pdf|title=Identifying tax havens and offshore financial centres|publisher=[[Tax Justice Network]]|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Classic tax haven countries such as [[Bermuda]], [[British Virgin Islands]] and the [[Cayman Islands]] are quintessentially offshore jurisdictions, and companies incorporated in those jurisdictions are invariably labelled as offshore companies.  Thereafter there are certain small intermediate countries or areas such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]] (sometimes referred to as "mid-shore" jurisdictions) which, whilst having oversized financial centres, are not zero tax regimes.  Finally, there are classes of industrialised economies which can be used as part of tax mitigation structures, including countries like [[Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]] and even the [[United Kingdom]], particularly in commentary relating to [[corporate inversion]].  Furthermore, in Federal systems, states which operate like a classic offshore centre can result in corporations formed there being labelled as offshore, even if they form part of the largest economy in the world (for example, [[Delaware]] in the [[United States]]).

Similarly, the term "company" is used loosely, and at its widest can be taken to refer to any type of artificial entity, including not just corporations and [[company|companies]], but potentially also [[Limited liability company|LLCs]], [[Limited partnership|LPs]], [[Limited liability partnership|LLPs]], and sometimes [[partnership]]s or even [[offshore trust]]s.

===Classifying offshore companies===

Historically, offshore companies were broadly divided into two categories.  On the one hand were companies which were statutorily exempt from taxation in their jurisdiction of registration provided that they did not undertake business with persons resident in that jurisdiction.  Such companies were usually called [[International business company|International Business Companies]], or IBCs.  Such companies were largely popularized by the [[British Virgin Islands]], but the model was copied widely.  However, in the early 2000s the [[OECD]] launched a global initiative to prevent "ring fencing" of taxation in this manner, and many leading jurisdictions (including the British Virgin Islands and [[Gibraltar]]) repealed their [[International Business Companies Act|International Business Companies legislation]].  But IBCs are still incorporated in a number of jurisdictions today including [[Anguilla]] and [[Panama]].

Separately from IBCs, there are countries which operate tax regimes which broadly achieve the same effect: so long as the company's activities are carried on overseas, and none of the profits are repatriated, the company is not subject to taxation in its home jurisdiction.  Where the home jurisdiction is regarded as an offshore jurisdiction, such companies are commonly regarded as offshore companies.  Examples of this include [[Hong Kong]] and [[Uruguay]].  However, these tax regimes are not limited to conventional offshore jurisdictions: the [[United Kingdom]] operates on broadly similar principles in relation to taxation of companies.

Separately there are offshore jurisdictions which simply do not impose any form of taxation on companies, and so their companies are de facto tax exempt.  Historically the best example of these countries were the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Bermuda]],&lt;ref&gt;Bermuda does, however, impose payroll tax on employees who actually work in Bermuda.&lt;/ref&gt; although other countries such as the [[British Virgin Islands]]&lt;ref name="Power Players"&gt;{{cite web |title=What are the most popular offshore jurisdictions? |url= https://www.oilglobal.com/AOC/Q4 |publisher=[[OIL (incorporations and corporate services)]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; have now moved to this model.  These could arguably fit into either of the previous two categories, depending on the fiscal point of view involved.

To the Offshore Company definition, applies five (non-cumulative) limiting conditions:
(1) The government in the country of incorporation does not levy an indirect tax on the OAC (however, the OSC must pay an annual fee to the government).
(2) Separate laws and regulations apply.
(3) The OSC doesn’t have its own physical office (address), personnel, means of communication etc. This means that the OAC must have a representative (registered agent) and office address (registered office) in the county of the incorporation.
(4) The OSC must be managed and governed by (an employee of) a local trust or law office.
(5) There is an instance of elements that benefit anonymity such as bearer shares and no or limited filing obligations.&lt;ref&gt;T.J van Koningsveld, 2016. De Offshore Wereld Ontmaskerd. Kerckebosch.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics of offshore companies===
[[File:Chart of an offshore company structure.jpg|thumb|Chart of an offshore company structure]]

Although all offshore companies differ to a degree depending upon the corporate law in the relevant jurisdiction, all offshore companies tend to enjoy certain core characteristics:
* They are broadly not subject to taxation in their home jurisdiction.
* The corporate regime will be designed to promote business flexibility.
* Regulation of corporate activities will normally be lighter than in a developed country.&lt;ref&gt;Classic offshore jurisdictions are very fond of the phrase "light touch" regulation, although in practice many offshore centres are witnessing increasingly invasive regulation.  This is probably reflective of the global trend towards greater regulation of the financial system rather than a change within the offshore financial world in particular.&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of taxation or regulation in the home jurisdiction does not, of course, exempt the relevant company from taxation or regulation abroad.  For example, [[Michael Kors Holdings Limited]] is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, but is listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], where it is subject both the U.S. taxation and to [[financial regulation]] by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]].

Another common characteristic of offshore companies is the limited amount of information available to the public.  This varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  At one end of the scale, in the Cayman Islands and Delaware, there is virtually no publicly available information.  But at the other end of the scale, in Hong Kong companies file annual returns with particulars of directors, shareholders and annual accounts.  However, even in jurisdictions where there is relatively little information available to the public as of right, most jurisdictions have laws which permit law enforcement authorities (either locally or from overseas) to have access to relevant information,&lt;ref&gt;See for example, in the British Virgin Islands, the Mutual Legal Assistance (United States of America) Act, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases, private individuals.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Anton Piller order]]s, which are available in most common law offshore jurisdictions.&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to flexible [[corporate law]], most offshore jurisdictions will normally remove corporate fetters such as [[thin capitalisation]] rules, [[financial assistance (share purchase)|financial assistance]] rules, and limitations on [[Corporate law#Capacity and powers|corporate capacity]] and [[corporate benefit]].  A number have also removed or watered down rules relating to maintenance of capital or restrictions on payment of [[dividend]]s.  Beyond the common themes, a number of jurisdictions have also enacted special corporate provisions to try and attract business through offering corporate mechanisms that allow complex business transactions or reorganisations to occur more smoothly.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [[British Virgin Islands company law#Reorganisation and restructuring|British Virgin Islands company law - Reorganisation and restructuring]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses of offshore companies===

Offshore companies are used [[Offshore financial centre#Offshore financial structures|for a variety of commercial and private purposes]], some legitimate and economically beneficial, whilst others may be harmful or even criminal.  Allegations are frequently made in the press about offshore companies being used for [[money laundering]], [[tax evasion]], [[fraud]], and other forms of [[white collar crime]].  Offshore companies are also used in a wide variety of commercial transactions from generic holding companies, to joint ventures and listing vehicles.  Offshore companies are also used widely in connection with private wealth for tax mitigation and privacy.  The use of offshore companies, particularly in [[tax planning]], has become controversial in recent years, and a number of high-profile companies have ceased using offshore entities in their group structure as a result of public campaigns for such companies to pay their "fair share" of Government taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e9fc449c-c2f0-11e2-bbbd-00144feab7de.html#axzz3CVr4cEjB|title=How we can make global companies pay their fair share of tax|publisher=''[[Financial Times]]''|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed information in relation to the use of offshore companies is notoriously difficult to come by because of the opaque nature of much of the business (and because, in many cases, the companies are used specifically to preserve the confidentiality of a transaction or individual).  It is a commonly held view that most uses of offshore companies are driven by tax mitigation and/or [[Arbitrage#Regulatory arbitrage|regulatory arbitrage]], although there are some suggestions that the amount of tax structuring may be less than commonly thought.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Offshore 2020]]'', a publication of market research published by [[Offshore Incorporations Limited Group|Offshore Incorporations Limited]], a leading offshore fiduciary services provider, recent surveys of industry practitioners suggest that the proportion of their work which is tax driven structuring is decreasing: from 15.9% in 2012 ({{cite news|title=Smoke, Mirrors and Offshore Regulation|url=http://www.chinaoffshore.com.hk/smoke-mirrors-and-offshore-regulation.html|accessdate=9 July 2014|newspaper=China Offshore|date=3 April 2013}}) to 10.3% in 2013 ({{cite news|title=Offshore 2020. Perception and Reality: Forces driving the offshore industry Report|url=http://www.economic-s.ru/index.php/author-articles/finances/offshore-2020-perception-and-reality-forces-driving-the-offshore-industry-report|accessdate=9 July 2014|newspaper=Economic-s|date=28 November 2013}}).  These figures need to be treated with caution as these are marketing reports, not systematic analyses.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other commonly cited legitimate uses of offshore companies include uses as [[joint ventures]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Anglo-Russian oil joint venture, [[TNK-BP]], was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands as a neutral third jurisdiction.&lt;/ref&gt; financing [[special purpose company|SPVs]], stock market listing vehicles, holding companies and asset holding structures, and trading vehicles.

Intermediate uses of offshore companies (i.e. uses which might be considered legitimate or illegitimate depending upon a particular person's view of legitimacy of [[globalisation]] and tax planning) include uses as [[offshore fund|investment funds]] and [[offshore trust|private wealth holding vehicles]].

==Offshoring as a business process==
{{Main|Offshoring}}
The alternative use of the phrase offshore company, being a business or part of a business which uses offshoring as part of its [[business process]], is less common, and is often used as a lazy shorthand way of saying that the relevant business engages in offshoring.

==Biography==

===Military career===

Manueli is of [[Rotuma]]n and [[Samoa]]n descent, he was a soldier in the Royal Fiji Military Forces, and a graduate of the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in [[England]]. He had a distinguished career with the Fijian military, and while still a [[lieutenant]], was appointed to the post of district officer on Rotuma for an interim period in 1960. He went on to become a Colonel and the first indigenous Commander of the Fiji Military Forces, which he led from 22 February 1974 until February 22, 1979.&lt;ref name="74to79"&gt;Fraenkel, Jon et al. (eds.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NoUxrbSlylYC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22Paul+Manueli%22+1974&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fsXqTObYE4G8lQfogsCvCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Paul%20Manueli%22%201974&amp;f=false The 2006 military takeover in Fiji: the coup to end all coups?], p. 54 (2009) ({{ISBN|1921536500}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Military Career===
Following his retirement, he has enjoyed considerable success as a business leader and has served on the boards of numerous corporations, including General Manager of [[BP]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. After the [[1987 Fijian coups d'état]], Manueli has held the portfolios of Minister for Home Affairs, Finance Minister and Minister for Justice in the Fijian Parliamentary Cabinet. Originally a member of the post-coup interim government, Manueli subsequently sought election and won the sole seat for the [[Rotuma (Rotuman Communal Constituency, Fiji)|Rotuman Communal Constituency]] and was made a Cabinet Minister in [[Sitiveni Rabuka]]'s governments. His most recent position was as Rotuma's representative on the [[Great Council of Chiefs]], which was abolished in 2012. He also is a member of the executive board of [[Warwick International Hotels]].

'''Photonics Spectra''' is a monthly business-to-business (B2B) magazine published for the engineers, scientists, and end users who develop, commercialize and buy [[photonic]] products. It provides both technical and applications information for all aspects of the global industry, integrating all segments of [[photonics]]: [[optics]], [[lasers]], [[Optical imaging|imaging]], [[fiber optics]] and [[electro-optics]] as well as photonic component manufacturing, solar cell improvements, LED lighting for cars and offices, THz, EHz, UV, IR, and visible light imaging and test equipment.

In addition to news and feature articles, Photonics Spectra contains business reports, technology updates, reader forums, new products and literature, calendars of conferences and courses, and applications reports.

Photonics Spectra has been published since 1967 by Laurin Publishing Company, Inc. in [[Pittsfield, MA]], United States.

==History==

The first Optical Industry Directory was published in 1954 by Dr. Clifton Tuttle, an eminent retired Eastman Kodak physicist. At its inception the Directory was a small single volume. It succeeded notably, expanding over the years into the present multimedia publication.

Theresa "Teddi" C. Laurin (1924 - November 5, 2015) joined the company in 1962 and, as publisher, worked closely with Dr. Tuttle. In 1964 Francis T. Laurin and Teddi C. Laurin purchased and incorporated the company, which later became known as Laurin Publishing Company.  In 1967, in response to industry demands, she founded and launched Optical Spectra. In 1982 the magazine's name was changed to Photonics Spectra to reflect the growing influence of these new light-based technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=35680#HISTORY#PUBS Photonics Spectra information on photonics.com web site] Last retrieved May 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the worldwide distribution of Photonics Spectra is over 90,000 copies.

Laurin Publishing currently maintains a staff of over 80 employees at its headquarters in Pittsfield, Mass. and at its editorial and sales branch offices. The company also includes several contributing editors located around the world and an editorial advisory board of over 25 leaders in the photonics industry.

==Prism Awards==

The Prism Awards for Photonics Innovation is an international competition that honors the best new photonic products on the market. The Prism Awards has received applications from more than 35 countries across the globe. Applications are judged by a panel of leading industry experts, venture capitalists, luminaries and visionaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photonicsprismaward.com/aboutus.aspx Prism Awards information on prismawards.org web site] Last retrieved July 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008 SPIE and Photonics Media have been working together on the award, named the "Photonics Oscar" by OptecNet Deutschland, to bring attention and give recognition to companies that are creating products that make a difference.

The '''Politics-administration dichotomy''' is a theory that constructs the boundaries of [[public administration]] and asserts the normative relationship between elected officials and administrators in a democratic society.&lt;ref name="Svara 51–58"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Svara |first=James |date=Jan–Feb 1998 |title=The Politics-Administration Dichotomy Model as Aberration |journal=Public Administration Review |volume=58 |pages=51–58 |doi=10.2307/976889|jstor=976889 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''politics-administration dichotomy'' itself does not appear to have a known inventor, even after exhaustive research, the combination of words that make up the phrase was first found in [[public administration]] literature from the 1940s with no clear originator.&lt;ref&gt;Overeem, Patrick (2012).

== History ==

[[File:Thomas Woodrow Wilson, Harris &amp; Ewing bw photo portrait, 1919.jpg|thumbnail|right|Portrait of Woodrow Wilson 1919]]

[[Woodrow Wilson]] is credited with the politics-administration dichotomy via his theories on public administration in his 1887 essay, "[[The Study of Administration]]". Wilson came up with a theory that politics and administration are inherently different and should be approached as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stillman, II |first=Richard |date=June 1973 |title=Woodrow Wilson and the Study of Administration |journal=The American Political Science Review |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=582–588 |doi=10.2307/1958787|jstor=1958787 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson wrote in his essay in regards to [[public administration]]: “The field of administration is a field of business. It is removed from the hurry and strife of politics.... Administration lies outside the proper sphere of politics. Administrative questions are not political questions. Although politics sets the tasks for administration, it should not be suffered to manipulate its offices.”&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, W., 1887, “The Study of Administration”. Political Science Quarterly, Reprinted in 1997 in Classics of Public Administration, 2d ed. Shafritz, J, and Hyde, A, Chicago: Dorsey Press.&lt;/ref&gt; With these words, Wilson started a debate that has been going on for decades and continues to this day. The politics-administration dichotomy is an important concept in the field of public administration and shows no signs of going away because it deals with the policy-makers role as an administrator and the balancing act that is the relationship between politics and administration.&lt;ref&gt;Reza Tahmasebi &amp; Seyyed Mohammad Mahdi Musavi. (2011).

== Perceived Advantages ==

Woodrow Wilson’s politics-administration dichotomy can potentially be substantial in sustaining a strong productive government. The complexity, difficulty level and ample multiplication of governmental functions can be seen as a main component in the cause to implement the politics-administration dichotomy. Due to Wilson's lack of faith in republican self-government and the overwhelming amount of “selfish, ignorant, timid, stubborn, or foolish” persons whom the “bulk of can vote,” this model provides a solution that would counteract the majority of the incumbent voters. By employing the elite philosophical leaders to improve, shape, condition and sway public opinion, politics-administration dichotomy, if carried out in an unselfish manner leaves little to no room for error. 

Woodrow Wilson’s model created one of the first concepts of checks and balances, which is one of the most predominant systems of democratic accountability used to shape the United States government. Nevertheless “separating the will of the people from politics” could be extremely beneficial and institutionally separating administration from politics could prove valuable in sustaining government accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jewison|first=Blayne|date=Feb 1996|title=A Case For Reinterpreted Dichotomy of Politics and Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Woodrow|date=July 1887|title=The Study of Administration|journal=Political Science Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Politics-administration dichotomy also leads to political neutrality. The blurring of "politics" and "policy" has cause to the advocations to dismiss "partisan politics" rather than "policy politics."
The importance of neutrality in politics and policy are established within the politics-administration dichotomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Overeem, |first=Patrick|title=THE VALUE OF THE DICHOTOMY: POLITICS, ADMINISTRATION, AND THE POLITICAL NEUTRALITY OF ADMINISTRATORS|journal=Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis (Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis).|date=June 2005|volume=27|issue=2|pages=311–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Standard definition is too narrow . If [[politics]] includes all of what we know as policy making, then the dichotomy would bar administrators, presumably including city managers, from participation. The dichotomy of policy and administration was a conceptual distinction underlying a theory of democratic accountability. It was not intended to guide behavior, it was intended as a behavioral prescription directed against contemporary practices of machine politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Montjoy |first=Robert |last2=Watson |first2=Douglas |date=May–June 1995 |title=A Case for Reinterpreted Dichotomy of Politics and Administration as a Professional Standard in Council-Manager Government  |jstor=3110241  |journal=Public Administration Review |publisher=Wiley |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=231–239 |doi=10.2307/3110241}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The strict definition is the model. It is not conceptually possible to have a one way dichotomy that keeps elected official out of administration but allows administrators to be active in policy. The dichotomy model standing alone is an aberration.&lt;ref name="Svara 51–58"/&gt;
{{quote|Arguably the father of American political administration, Wilson, in his essay '[[The Study of Administration]]', suggested that in order to have objectivity and progress, the administration must be separate from politics ... The political/administration dichotomy aimed to separate the power between political leaders and the merit-based appointment of professional permanent civil servants in the administrative state ... At the turn of the 20th century, the field focused on making the bureaucracy more effective ... The field’s basic premise was to take a business-like approach to government and its activities.&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heydeesmeet.blogspot.com/2011/03/politicaladministrative-dichotomy.html|title=Urban-imagination: The political/administrative dichotomy|publisher=heydeesmeet.blogspot.com|accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} By Wilson making the statement, "Government should be run like a business," he thereby opened up many loop holes for the capitalist society to exploit the government for things they didn’t actually have. This statement ends in a very dangerous uncharted territory for people now. Based on the fact government could be run like a business. The concept "everyone has a boss" with creating the business like mindset running our country it makes everyone have to answer to someone (higher on the totem pole) than the other, it creates a sense of working for your job when you are supposed to be working for the people whom you represent. So now, instead of implementing policy to help the people, administrators and politicians are more concerned about who is funding/appointing than they are worried about the common man. That isn’t just the biggest problem for Politic administration Dichotomy it is a huge problem for the sustainability of our government and the world.&lt;ref name="blogspot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sagepub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aas.sagepub.com/content/16/2/141.short|title=American Public Administration and the Idea of Reform|publisher=aas.sagepub.com|accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raúl Diez Canseco Terry''' (born 1948) is a [[Peru]]vian [[business]]man and [[politician]]. He played a role in bringing international companies such as [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] to Peru. He also founded several educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rauldiezcansecoterry.com/empresarial.htm Raúl Diez Canseco's homepage] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the Minister of Trade and Tourism and the [[Vice President of Peru|First Vice President]]&lt;ref&gt;The Peruvian government has two Vice President posts. Diez Canseco was the First Vice President, and therefore first in line for the presidency,&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Alejandro Toledo]] presidency.&lt;ref name="elregionalpiura"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elregionalpiura.com.pe/index.php/especiales/164-informes/11143-presidentes-y-vicepresidentes-desde-1980-en-peru-crisis-y-realidades|title=Presidentes y vicepresidentes desde 1980 en Perú, crisis y realidades|date=26 July 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned in 2003 from the Cabinet, and in 2004 from the Vice Presidency, after an accusation which favored the father of his present wife. He was subjected to investigations and the charges being dismissed by the Congress of the republic and finally absolved of all charges.

The '''sailing ship effect''' is a phenomenon by which the introduction of a new technology to a market accelerates the innovation of an incumbent technology.&lt;ref name="howells2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howells|first=John|author2=Handelshøjskolen i Århus |title=The Response of Old Technology Incumbents to Technological Competition: Does the Sailing Ship Effect Exist?|journal=Journal of Management Studies|date=November 2002|volume=39|issue=7|pages=887–906|doi=10.1111/1467-6486.00316|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-6486.00316/abstract|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the term was coined by W.H. Ward in 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=W.H.|title=The sailing ship effect|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Physics and Physical Society|year=1967|issue=18|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; the concept was made clear much earlier in a book by S.C. Gilfillan entitled "''Inventing the ship''" published in 1935. The name of the "effect" is due to the reference to advances made in sailing ships in the second half of the 1800s in response to the introduction of steamships.&lt;ref name="geels2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geels|first=Frank W.|title=Technological Transitions and System Innovations: A Co-evolutionary and Socio-technical Analysis|year=2005|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=9781845424596|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDfrb7TNX5oC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=The+Response+of+Old+Technology+Incumbents+to+Technological+Competition+%E2%80%93+Does+the+Sailing+Ship+Effect+Exist?&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TT5RUpXPLsKVygGsloDoCg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&amp;q=Sailing%20Ship%20Effect&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Ward, in the 50 years after the introduction of the steam ship, sailing ships made more improvements than they had in the previous 300 years. The term "Sailing Ship Effect" applies to situations in which an old technology is revitalized, experiencing a "last gasp" when faced with the risk of being replaced by a newer technology.
Here is how Gilfillan put it:
"It is paradoxical, but on examination logical, that this noble flowering of the sailing ship, this apotheosis during
her decline and just before extermination, was partly vouchsafed by her supplanter, the steamer." (Gilfillan,
1935, p. 156).

This effect is the economic version of a phenomenon in [[biology]] called the [[Red Queen hypothesis|red queen effect]].&lt;ref name="Schiavone2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiavone|first=Francesco|title=Communities of Practice and Vintage Innovation: A Strategic Reaction to Technological Change|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319019024|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcb-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=the+acceleration+of+innovation+in+the+old+technology+in&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-j1RUu25BpKqyQHhrIDIBg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20acceleration%20of%20innovation%20in%20the%20old%20technology%20in&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Three possible explanations have been suggested as the cause of the Sailing Ship Effect:&lt;ref name="Schiavone2013"/&gt;
* Old technologies improve in an attempt to avoid being replaced.
* Components of new technology "spill over," improving incumbent technologies. 
* New technologies generate new notoriety for old technologies.

==Controversy==
In 2005, the validity of the original example of the sailing ship effect was called into doubt.&lt;ref name="geels2005"/&gt;  In a paper entitled "The Response of Old Technology Incumbents to Technological Competition: Does the Sailing Ship Effect Exist?" author John Howells contends that sailing ships and steamships serviced different market segments in the 1860s and 1870s and, therefore, were not directly competing technologies.&lt;ref name="howells2002"/&gt; Howells goes on to hypothesize that rapid advancements in sailing technology of that era may have arisen from competition between sailing ship firms.  The paper goes on to call into doubt the prevalence of the phenomenon. 
On the other hand, De Liso and Filatrella, while providing a review of the literature which confirms the existence of the sailing ship effect, provide a mathematical model which can simulate the sailing ship effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Liso N and Filatrella G|first=|year=2008|title=ON TECHNOLOGY COMPETITION: A FORMAL ANALYSIS OF THE ‘SAILING-SHIP EFFECT’|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10438590701560360|journal=Economics of Innovation and New Technology|volume=17|pages=593–610|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Liso N and Filatrella G|first=|year=2011|title=On delayed technological shifts|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10438599.2010.533536|journal=Economics of Innovation and New Technology|volume=20|pages=563–580|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Liso, Nicola and Filatrella, Giovanni|first=|date=2011|title=On delayed technological shifts|url=|journal=Economics of Innovation and New Technology|volume=20, Issue 6|pages=563–580|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent paper by Sandro Mendonca argues that "The modernisation of the sailing trader occurs before, not after, the steamship had become an effective competitor", and further cautions "if history is to be used to give credence to explanations of empirical regularities in a variety of settings the original source of the relevant concepts must be carefully revisited and deeply researched"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendonça|first=Sandro|date=2013|title=The "sailing ship effect": Reassessing history as a source of insight on technical change|url=|journal=Research Policy|volume=42, Issue 10|pages=1724–1738|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6036">'''Shareholder oppression''' occurs when the majority shareholders in a [[corporation]] take action that unfairly prejudices the minority.  It most commonly occurs in [[close corporation]]s, because the lack of a public market for shares leaves minority shareholders particularly vulnerable, since minority shareholders cannot escape mistreatment by selling their stock and exiting the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Means, Benjamin|title=A Voice-Based Framework for Evaluating Claims of Minority Shareholder Oppression in the Close Corporation|date=October 15, 2008|publisher=Georgetown Law Journal|volume=97|ssrn=1285204}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority shareholders may harm the economic interests of the minority by refusing to declare [[dividend]]s or attempting a [[squeezeout]].

The potential for shareholder oppression arguably increased when [[corporate law]] was changed to eliminate the [[common law]] right of minority shareholders to veto fundamental corporate changes such as [[merger]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=1989|publisher=Duke L.J.|pages=258|year=1989|title=Rejecting the Minority Discount|author=Heglar, Robert B.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/duklr1989&amp;section=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that the [[business judgment rule]] and notions of [[majority rule]] have allowed shareholder majorities to use the minority's investment without paying for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=60|publisher=Miss.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9307">'''Startup studio''', also known as a '''startup factory''', or a '''startup foundry,''' or a '''venture builder''', is a studio-like company that aims at building several companies in succession. This style of business building is referred to as "parallel entrepreneurship".&lt;ref name="Lapowsky-2014" /&gt;

==History==
[[Idealab]], founded by [[Bill T. Gross|Bill Gross]] in 1996, was one of the first to introduce the '[[Business incubator|incubator industry]]', and has started over 75 companies. Idealab was founded to test many ideas at once and turn the best of them into companies while also attracting the human and financial capital necessary to bring them to the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Idealab: First Mover, Last Survivor|last=Farmer|first=Ryan|publisher=California Institute of Technology|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecorner.stanford.edu/podcasts/2596/A-Devotion-to-New-Ideas|title=Bill Gross: A Devotion to New Ideas {{!}} Stanford eCorner|website=ecorner.stanford.edu|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The startup studio trend had really begun to gain momentum around 2008. Today, there are over 65 startup studios across the world, of which 17 have been built since 2013.&lt;ref name="Chernova-2015" /&gt;

==Types==

There are several types of startup studio models.

==="Builder" studios===
A builder startup studio focuses on creating and developing a company, mostly from internal ideas.&lt;ref name="aventurebuilders"&gt;
{{cite news
| title       =How ‘venture builders’ are changing the startup model
| first       =Ali

| publisher   =[[VentureBeat]]
| date        =January 18, 2015
| accessdate  = 2016-05-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of this model are [[Rocket Internet]], [[eFounders]], Next Big Thing, 0smosis,  The Combine, MAKE IT, TechnoFounders, Ant Farm in Mumbai and Makeshift in Europe, Interplay Ventures，Atomic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/atomic-with-first-fund-looks-to-upend-venture-capital-model-1485174603|title=Atomic, With First Fund, Looks to Upend Venture-Capital Model|last=Geron|first=Tomio|date=2017-01-23|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Giant Pixel in the US, Stanley Park Ventures in Canada, 25Fifteen in Australia, JCS Venture Lab&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jcsvl.com|title=JCS Venture Lab|website=JCS Venture Lab|language=en|access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Singapore, RE.A.PRA in Southeast Asia, and Far Ventures in South Africa. This is the true startup studio model, offering balance between investing funds and resources to turn ideas into companies.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Unlike [[business incubator]]s and [[Business accelerator|accelerators]], venture builders generally don't accept applications concerning their portfolio of companies, and the companies instead "pull business ideas from within their own network of resources and assign internal teams to develop them."&lt;ref name="aventurebuilders"/&gt;

According to [[VentureBeat]], [[Nova Spivack]] was "part of the early technologists who pioneered the venture production studio model. He wrote about the model in 2011 at a time when most of its  production elements were still in gestation. Nova actually invented the Venture Production Studio term, calling it a 'new approach to building startups.'"&lt;ref name="aventurebuilders"/&gt;

==="Investor" studios===
{{See also|Venture capital financing|Corporate venture capital}}
Investor startup studios bring in early-stage external startups and help them grow by providing them both funds and expertise. US-based studios Expa, [[Betaworks]] and [[Science Inc.|Science, Inc]]. and Singapore-Stockholm-based [http://www.antler.co Antler], fall in this category.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

At the very end of the spectrum, some [[Venture Capital|VC]] firms are growing closer to the startup studio model by intervening very operationally in the startup they invest; for instance [[Andreessen Horowitz]] and [[Google Ventures]]. However, this participation is usually limited to some areas, such as recruitment, fund raising, or PR relations.&lt;ref name="ODell-2013" /&gt;

==="Incubator" studios===
{{See also|Business incubator}}
Incubator startup studios are accelerators that get equity in exchange of providing funds and expertise, but also get involved in building the startup.

==Overview==
===Business model===

Startup studios are often mistaken with [[Business incubator|startup incubators]] and [[Seed accelerator|startup accelerator]], or operational [[Venture Capital]] firms.

The startup studio model is defined by three important criteria:&lt;ref name="Elziere-2014" /&gt;{{self-published source|date=September 2015}}&lt;ref name="Rao-2013" /&gt;

* '''Startup studios focus their business on creating startups'''
Unlike startup incubators or VCs, the main goal of a startup studio is to build a startup from the ground up. This implies an important involvement of time, dedication and resources to working operationally on the project for a period of time.

* '''Startup studios build several startups following a repetitive process'''
One focus of a startup studio is the rapid development and prototyping of new products. They work on multiple startups and projects simultaneously instead of building one project at a time.

* '''Startup studios build an infrastructure that enables an efficient venture building process'''
Startup studios own an infrastructure made of pooled resources: technical tools, management processes, and a multi-disciplinary team. By building several projects a year with the same team, startups studios can re-use this infrastructure, software and best practices across products.

===Features in early stage ventures===
;Startup studios in the early-stage entrepreneurship environment
Startup studios occupy a specific place in the entrepreneurship environment, based on the amount of human and financial support they provide to the startups:&lt;ref name="Elziere-2015" /&gt;{{self-published source|date=September 2015}}
* Incubators and accelerators focus on providing advice and some operational guidance to the startups they select. They are mostly providing ‘Human Capital’.
* Startup studios provide a high level of ‘Human Capital’ along with some ‘Financial Capital’. They dedicate a team to the development of their startups and inject limited funds early stage in their startups.
* Angel investors and early-stage VC focus more on ‘Financial Capital’: they provide funds to help their portfolio startups develop, sometimes along with some guidance and strategic help.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7897">'''Task management''' is the process of managing a [[Task (project management)|task]] through its life cycle. It involves planning, testing, tracking, and reporting. Task management can help either individual achieve goals, or groups of individuals collaborate and share knowledge for the accomplishment of collective goals.&lt;ref name="Journal of UKM"&gt;Maus, Heiko, M.P. van der Aalst, Wil, Rickayzen, Alan, Riss, Uwe. V. “Challenges for Business Processes and Task Management,” Journal of Universal Knowledge Management. Volume 0, Issue 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Tasks are also differentiated by complexity, from low to high.&lt;ref name="Journal of UKM"/&gt;

Effective task management requires managing all aspects of a task, including its status, priority, time, human and financial resources assignments, recurrence, dependency, notifications and so on. These can be lumped together broadly into the basic activities of task management.

Managing multiple individuals or team tasks may be assisted by specialized software, for example [[workflow management system|workflow]] or [[project management software]]. In fact, many people{{who?|date=August 2018}} believe that task management should serve as a foundation for [[project management]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;Bianchi, Rich. “6 key elements for better Task Management,” Tech Republic. January 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Task management may form part of project management and [[process management]] and can serve as the foundation for efficient [[workflow]] in an organization. Project managers adhering to task-oriented management have a detailed and up-to-date project schedule, and are usually good at directing team members and moving the project forward.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Cutting "Relationship vs. Task Oriented Management". 3 March 2010 http://www.pmhut.com/relationship-vs-task-oriented-management&lt;/ref&gt;

==Task life cycle==
The status of tasks can be described by the following states:
* Ready
* Assigned
* Terminated
* Expired
* Forwarded
* Started
* Finished
* Verified
* Failed

The following state machine diagram describes different states of a task over its life cycle. This diagram is referenced from IBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life Cycle of Human Tasks|url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQH9M_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.bpc.doc/doc/bpc/ctasklifecycle_todo.html|work=IBM WebSphere Process Server documentation|publisher=IBM|accessdate=25 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more up to date task's state machine diagram applicable to the new [[continuous delivery]] method could be found here.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.binfire.com/blog/2018/02/anatomy-of-a-task/|title=Anatomy of a task|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TaskLifeCycle.png]]

==Activities supported by tasks==
As a discipline, task management embraces several key activities. Various conceptual breakdowns exist, and these, at a high-level, always include creative, functional, project, performance and service activities.
* Creative activities pertain to task creation. In context, these should allow for task planning, brainstorming, creation, elaboration, clarification, organization, reduction, targeting and preliminary prioritization.
* Functional activities pertain to personnel, sales, quality or other management areas, for the ultimate purpose of ensuring production of final goods and services for delivery to customers. In context these should allow for planning, reporting, tracking, prioritizing, configuring, delegating, and managing of tasks.
* Project activities pertain to planning and time and costs reporting. These can encompass multiple functional activities but are always greater and more purposeful than the sum of its parts. In context, project activities should allow for project task breakdown also known as [[work breakdown structure]], task allocation, inventory across projects, and concurrent access to task databases.
* Service activities pertain to client and internal company services provision, including customer relationship management and knowledge management. In context, these should allow for file attachment and links to tasks, document management, access rights management, inventory of client &amp; employee records, orders &amp; calls management, and annotating tasks.
* Performance activities pertain to tracking performance and fulfillment of assigned tasks. In context these should allow for tracking by time, cost control, stakeholders, and priority; charts, exportable reports, status updates, deadline adjustments, and activity logging.
* Report activities pertain to the presentation of information regarding the other five activities listed, including the graphical display.

==Task management software==
{{See also|:Category:Task management software}}
Task management software tools abound in the marketplace. Some are free; others intended for enterprise-wide deployment purposes. Some are simple to-do lists, while others boast enterprise-wide task creation, visualization, and notification capabilities - among others. Task management is used by small to Fortune 100 size companies. It does support simple individual projects to corporate task management activities.

[[Project management software]], [[calendaring software]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ganttic.com/tour/customized-data-in-scheduling-software |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407093014/http://www.ganttic.com/tour/customized-data-in-scheduling-software |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[workflow management system|workflow software]]&lt;ref name="ceiton"&gt;http://www.ceiton.com/CMS/EN/workflow/introduction.html#Task_Management&lt;/ref&gt; also often provide task management software with advanced support for task management activities and corresponding software environment dimensions, reciprocating the myriad project and performance activities built into most good enterprise-level task management software products.

Software dimensions crisscrossing nearly all lines of task management products include task creation, task visualization, notifications, assign resources, compatibility, [[configurability]], [[scalability]], and [[report]]ing
* Task creation encompasses collaborative capabilities for turning ideas into actions (tasks). This includes activities involved in defining the task and encompasses the collaboration needed in the planning process.
* Task visualization encompasses presentation of tasks, most often through time and list forms. Priority visualization encompasses classification (e.g., budget, time, stakeholder) and mechanism (e.g., color code or text). Calendaring covers scheduling (e.g., availability, meetings, appointments and other potential conflicts) and notifications.
* Notifications encompass configurable settings for informing past, present and pending deadlines.
* Assigning resources encompasses the ability to delegate tasks and tools to single or multiple people.
* Compatibility encompasses the ability of a task management environment to connect to other systems, software and environments. It includes setting a structure and restrictions on communication going from the task management environment to other software, systems, and environments.
* Configurability encompasses the ability to add, remove and manage functionality and usability in task management environments.
* Scalability encompasses ability to perform a task properly when a change in the quantity of users is done to meet the specific task requirements.
* Reporting encompasses presentation of information by displaying either in tabular or graphical display.

TAWPI was a membership association that focused on the improvement of work processes in data capture, document and remittance processing. It was originally the OCR Users Association (OCRUA) founded in 1970, which was renamed the Recognition Technology Users Association (RTUA) in 1981. In 1993, RTUA merged with DEMA (Association for Input Technology and Management) and various OCR/Scanner/Fax associations and changed its name to TAWPI. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.yourdictionary.com/tawpi&lt;/ref&gt;

TAWPI facilitated the peer-to-peer exchange of actionable information, ideas and best practices on the converging technologies and processes that enable payments automation and document management. The TAWPI annual forum and expo was a highly interactive, multi-dimensional event featuring ideas, information and advice on [[payments]] automation, distributed [[wikt:capture|capture]], and document &amp; forms automation. TAWPI also hosted an annual Capture Conference and an annual [[Healthcare]] Payments Automation Summit.

In 2010, TAWPI merged with the International Accounts Payable Professionals (IAPP), International Accounts Receivable Professionals (IARP), the National Association of Purchasing and Payables (NAPP) to form the Institute of Financial Operations (IFO). Based in Orlando, Fla., with affiliates in the U.S., Canada, and the UK,  

The members and leaders of TAWPI, especially Herb Schantz of HLS Associates, were responsible for much of the development and application of optical scanning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aiim.org/community/blogs/expert/a-mobile-capture-success-at-tawpi-capture-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5581">[[File:Mary Parker Follett (1868-1933).jpg|thumb|Mary P. Follett]]
"'''The Giving of Orders'''" is a 1926 essay by [[Mary Parker Follett]].&lt;ref name="TheGivingOfOrders"&gt;Follett, Mary Parker. "The giving of orders." Scientific foundations of business administration (1926): 29-37.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, she addresses issues of authority in business management, specifically how managers can gain influence over informal groups that naturally form in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Nohria, Nitin. "Mary Parker Follett’s view on power, the giving of orders, and authority: An alternative to hierarchy or a utopian ideology." Mary Parker Follett–Prophet of Management (1995): 154-62.&lt;/ref&gt; She found that people respond better to situations than to top-down orders and managers should give people the means and willingness to respond to given situations instead of merely giving orders: "My solution is to depersonalize the giving of orders, to unite all concerned in a study of the situation, to discover the law of the situation, and obey that."&lt;ref name="TheGivingOfOrders"/&gt;

== Background ==
As a young girl, Mary Follett faced many struggles. Her sister died while she was young and her father was in and out of her life. She was always involved in government and recent issues going on throughout her community. Although, she had limited access to research funds and other resources, she was able to write two influential books;" The New State" and "Creative Experience" which were insights gained by twenty years of civic and professional work in Boston's immigrant neighborhoods. By commuting everyday from her home in Boston to Roxbury, she recognized the difference between both cities and decided to make changes in Ward 17. With so much involvement throughout her lifetime, she started a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mary P. Follett: Creating Democracy, transforming management|last=Tonn|first=Joan|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
By addressing the way managers gain influence over informal groups, Follett explains that training the employee can not only help them better understand their job description, but also helps the employer to be better understood. She argues that "orders should be the composite conclusion of those who give and those who receive them; more than this, that they should be the integration of the people concerned and the situation; more even than this, that they should be the integrations involved in the evolving situation.".&lt;ref name="Follet, M.P 1926"&gt;Follet, M.P (1926), "The Giving of Orders", in Dynamic Administration; The Collected Works of Mary Parker Follet. Henry C. Metcalf and L. Urwick, Eds. New York: Harper and Brothers Publishers, 1941: 65-66&lt;/ref&gt; Follett found that workmen respond better to "the order integral to a particular situation", which is arrived at by "joint study of the problem". She argued that when "orders are simply part of the situation, the question of someone giving and someone receiving does not come up. Both accept the orders given by the situation." &lt;ref name="Follet, M.P 1926"/&gt; In all, Follett cautions managers to avoid giving orders but rather to look with others to the situation at hand to determine an appropriate response.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, Cynthia (1995). "Teaching Introduction to Public Administration via the Case Method". ''Journal of Public Administration Education: 102-115''&lt;/ref&gt; Follett felt that depersonalizing orders would foster collaborative decision making, in which managers and employees would "discover" the most appropriate decision. Follett developed the circular theory of power, distinguishing between "power-over" and "power-with" (coercive vs. co-active power), while also advocating for power sharing and employee participation.&lt;ref&gt;Hopen, Deborah (2010). "The changing role and practices of successful leaders.". ''The Journal for Quality and Participation, 33(1), 4-9.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary context==

While Follett's writings were popular during her time period, they were nearly forgotten within ten years of her death. Scholars speculate that this could be due to gender discrimination and the fact that her ideas were too ahead of her time. Even though her perspective on voice is much more extreme than contemporary researchers, there has been renewed interest in her writings in the last couple of decades.&lt;ref&gt;Barclay, Laurie (2005).

''Journal of Management History''.&lt;/ref&gt; Follett's work came during the height of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]]'s [[Scientific Management]] movement, which advocated the "one right way" for tasks to be performed, and [[Max Weber]]'s view that direct hierarchy was the best form of leadership for larger organizations. The Giving of Orders challenged both of these paradigms and presented an alternative to purely top-down hierarchy in management. Many consider Follett “the Prophet of Management” because her ideas have affected the field of management for the past six decades.&lt;ref&gt;Mendenhall, Marsh, Mark E, W. Jeffrey (2010).

'''''The Modern Corporation and Private Property''''' is a book written by [[Adolf Berle]] and [[Gardiner Means]] published in 1932 regarding the foundations of [[United States corporate law]]. It explores the evolution of big business through a legal and economic lens, and argues that in the modern world those who legally have ownership over companies have been separated from their control. The second, revised edition was released in 1967. It serves as a foundational text in [[corporate governance]], [[corporate law]] (company law), and [[institutional economics]].

Berle and Means argued that the structure of [[corporate law]] in the United States in the 1930s enforced the separation of [[ownership]] and [[Control (management)|control]] because the [[corporate personhood|corporate person]] formally owns a corporate entity even while [[shareholders]] own shares in the corporate entity and elect corporate directors who control the company's activities. Compared to the notion of personal private property, say as one's laptop or bicycle, the functioning of modern company law “has destroyed the unity that we commonly call [[property]]”. This occurred for a number of reasons, foremost being the dispersal of shareholding ownership in big corporations: the typical shareholder is uninterested in the day-to-day affairs of the company, yet thousands of people like him or her make up the majority of owners throughout the economy. The result is that those who are directly interested in day-to-day affairs, the [[management]] and the [[Board of directors|directors]], have the ability to manage the resources of companies to their own advantage without effective shareholder scrutiny.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The property owner who invests in a modern corporation so far surrenders his [[wealth]] to those in control of the corporation that he has exchanged the  position of independent owner for one in which he may become merely recipient of  the wages of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]... [Such owners] have surrendered the right that the corporation should be operated in their sole interest...” &lt;ref&gt;at 355 of the 1932 edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Berle and Means researched the consequences of ownership and control being separate. As businesses grow and shareholders increase in number, any shareholdings that directors have will be a proportionally smaller capital stake. Directors' income will derive mostly from return on their labor as directors, not from their capital investment. If their motivation is purely pecuniary

&lt;blockquote&gt;“the owners most emphatically will not be served by a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] seeking controlling group”.&lt;ref&gt;114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The implications of their work were clear. Berle and Means advocated embedded voting rights for all shareholders, greater transparency, and accountability. However, with the release of the revised edition, Berle and Means also pointed to the disparity that existed between those who did have shareholdings and those who did not.

==Introductory==
;Introduction by Murray Weidenbaum and Mark Jensen
[[Murray Weidenbaum]] and Mark Jensen have added their introduction to more recent editions of the text. It casts a thoroughly skeptical perspective on the book, since the two came from very different academic perspectives, generally more orthodox and conservative in their outlook politically.

;Property, Production and Revolution - A Preface to the Revised Edition by Adolf A. Berle&lt;ref&gt;This was an article published separately and earlier as AA Berle, 'Property, Production and Revolution' (1965) 65 Columbia Law Review 1&lt;/ref&gt;
For the 1967 Revised Edition, Berle added a new Preface, updating the picture and bringing in new arguments and observations. He summed up the whole point of the book at the same time, making it a valuable adjunct to the text. "Why have stockholders?" he asked.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"What contribution do they make, entitling them to heirship of half the profits of the industrial system, receivable partly in the form of dividends, and partly in the form of increased market values resulting from undistributed corporate gains? Stockholders toil not, neither do they spin, to earn that reward. They are beneficiaries by position only. Justification for their inheritance must be sought outside classic economic reasoning.”&lt;ref&gt;xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The position of stockholders' profit, said Berle,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“can be founded only upon social grounds. There is... a value attached to individual life, individual development, individual solution of personal problems, individual choice of consumption and activity. Wealth unquestionably does add to an individual’s capacity and range in pursuit of happiness and self-development. There is certainly advantage to the community when men take care of themselves. But that justification turns on the distribution as well as the existence of wealth. Its force exists only in direct ratio to the number of individuals who hold such wealth. Justification for the stockholder’s existence thus depends on increasing distribution within the American population. Ideally the stockholder’s position will be impregnable only when every American family has its fragment of that position and of the wealth by which the opportunity to develop individuality becomes fully actualized.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Implications of the Corporate Revolution in Economic Theory by Gardiner C. Means

;Preface (1932)

;Tables and charts

==Book I, Property in Flux==
Book I is entitled, "Property in Flux: Separation of the attributes of ownership under the corporate system" and provides a general picture of the shifting economic power structure that Berle and Means observed.

===I Property in transition===
This first chapter explores the basic thesis of Berle and Means, that with the emergence of the [[corporation]], the very institution of private property has been fundamentally altered.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“In its new aspect the corporation is a means whereby the wealth of innumerable individuals has been concentrated into huge aggregates and whereby control over this wealth has been surrendered to a unified direction. The power attendant upon such concentration has brought forth princes of industry, whose position in the community is yet to be defined. The surrender of control over their wealth by investors has effectively broken the old property relationships and has raised the problem of defining these relationship anew. The direction of industry by persons other than those who have ventured their wealth has raised the question of the motive force back of such direction and the effective distribution of the returns from business enterprise.”&lt;ref&gt;4&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Such an organization of economic activity rests upon two developments, each of which has made possible an extension of the area under unified control. The [[factory system]], the basis of the [[industrial revolution]], brought an increasingly large number of workers directly under a single management. Then, the modern corporation, equally revolutionary in its effect, placed the wealth of innumerable individuals under the same central control. By each of these changes the power of those in control was immensely enlarged and the status of those involved, worker or property owner, was radically changed. The independent worker who entered the factory became a wage laborer surrendering the direction of his labor to his industrial master. The property owner who invests in a modern corporation so far surrenders his wealth to those in control of the corporation that he has exchanged the position of independent owner for one in which he may become merely recipient of the wages of capital.”&lt;ref&gt;5&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Berle and Means continue by emphasizing how increasing dispersion of stock ownership under a shareholder public is necessary for those in control to enforce their position. Even if they have minority shareholding, the public so widespread is not in a position to be organized to hold those who handle their investments to account.&lt;ref&gt;6&lt;/ref&gt; The divergence of interest between owners and controllers,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“has destroyed the unity that we commonly call property - has divided ownership into nominal ownership and the power formerly joined to it. Thereby the corporation has changed the nature of profit-seeking enterprise.”&lt;ref&gt;7&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Private enterprise, on the other hand, has assumed an owner of the instruments of production with complete property rights over those instruments... Whereas the organization of feudal economic life rested upon an elaborate system of binding customs, the organization under the system of private enterprise has rested upon the self-interest of the property owner - a self-interest held in check only by [[Competition (economics)|competition]] and the conditions of [[supply and demand]]... Such self-interest has long been regarded as the best guarantee of [[economic efficiency]]. It has been assumed that, if the individual is protected in the right both to use his own property as he sees fit and to receive the full fruits of its use, his desire for personal gain, for profits, can be relied upon as an effective incentive to his efficient use of any industrial property he may possess.”&lt;ref&gt;9&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shareholders, it is stated

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“cannot be motivated by those profits to a more efficient use of the property, since they have surrendered all disposition of it to those in control of the enterprise.”&lt;ref&gt;9&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===II The appearance of the corporate system===
The second chapter puts forward the view that corporations have entered, grown and become dominant first in the fields of public utilities, common carriers, banks and insurance companies and last in the areas of personal service and agriculture.

It also goes on to emphasize the fact that the date of its appearance and degree of its dominance have in general varied with two factors
* The public character of the activity in question
* The amount of fixed capital required to carry on business

===III The concentration of economic power===
This part proceeds to emphasize the ubiquity of corporations in production in the modern economy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“These great companies form the very framework of American industry. The individual must come in contact with them almost constantly. He may own an interest in one or more of them, he may be employed by one of them, but above all he is continually accepting their service.”&lt;ref&gt;19&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“In conclusion, then, the huge corporation, the corporation with $90m of assets or more, has come to dominate most major industries if not all [[industry]] in the United States.”&lt;ref&gt;44&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of consequences result, the fifth being that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“The economic power in the hands of the few persons who control a giant corporation is a tremendous force which can harm or benefit a multitude of individuals, affect whole districts, shift the currents of trade, bring ruin to one community and prosperity to another. The organizations which they control have passed far beyond the realm of private enterprise - they have become more nearly social institutions.”&lt;ref&gt;46&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===IV The dispersion of stock ownership===
In this Chapter, Berle and Means present considerable statistical evidence of the growing dispersion of stock ownership around the economy. They draw a distinction between "passive" property, or that which merely sits idle or is consumed, and "productive" property, which is actually employed to create more wealth. They say,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“over the enterprise and over the physical property - the instruments of production - in which he has an interest, the owner has little control. At the same time he bears no responsibility with respect to the enterprise or its physical property. It has often been said that the owner of a horse is responsible. If the horse lives he must feed it. If the horse dies he must bury it. No such responsibility attaches to a share of [[stock]]. The owner is practically powerless through his own efforts to affect the underlying property... Physical property capable of being shaped by its owner could bring to him direct satisfaction apart from the income it yielded in more concrete form. It represented an extension of his own personality. With the corporate revolution, this quality has been lost to the property owner much as it has been lost to the worker through the industrial revolution.”&lt;ref&gt;64&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While [[Real estate|land]] could be enjoyed whatever its market value, Berle and Means point out that [[Share (finance)|shares]] cannot. The fact that so much wealth is in shares means we are tied to the market in a way we never have been before.&lt;ref&gt;65&lt;/ref&gt;

===V The evolution of control===
This chapter traces the power that shareholders have to control managers. The most important instrument is the [[vote]], and they note,

&lt;blockquote&gt;“In contrast to non-voting preferred, the use of non-voting common stock has met with considerable disfavor. Both the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[New York Curb Exchange|New York Curb]] have refused to list new issues of non-voting [[common stock]]; for practical purposes, this would seem to have eliminated the use of this device on any large scale in the immediate future.”&lt;ref&gt;72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Berle and Means note the development of [[Voting trust]]s, which initially met bitter opposition, being declared illegal by courts. This was the practice whereby voting powers were transferred from the stockholder to a trustee for a fixed period. State legislatures were needed to authorize their use, after [[Delaware]] allowed them but other courts struck them down.

Berle and Means also deployed, uniquely, the concept of a shareholder's "[[rational apathy]]".

&lt;blockquote&gt;"the normal apathy of the small stockholder is such that he will either fail to return his proxy vote, or will sign on the dotted line, returning his proxy to the [management] of the corporation."&lt;ref&gt;74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===VI The divergence of interest between ownership and control===
On the divergence of interest, Berle and Means' central question is,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“have we any justification for assumption that those in control of a modern corporation will also choose to operate it in the interests of the owners? The answer to this question will depend on the degree to which the self-interest of those in control may run parallel to the interests of ownership and, insofar as they differ, on the checks on the use of power which may be established by political, economic, or social conditions... If we are to assume that the desire for personal profit is the prime force motivating control, we must conclude that the interests of control are different from and often radically opposed to those of ownership; that the owners most emphatically will not be served by a profit-seeking controlling group.”&lt;ref&gt;113-114&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Book II, Regrouping of Rights==
Book II's full title is, "Regrouping of Rights: Relative legal position of ownership and "control“". Its subject is to explore the change in the balance of power between shareholders and the board of directors.

===I Evolution of the modern corporate structure===
Berle and Means begin by setting the context of the company's formation. Originally the company was granted privileges to be a separate legal person and carry on business, to sue and be sued and these rights usually went with the grant of a monopoly. The monopolies were no longer used now. But then came the easy registration of companies and [[limited liability]] for stockholders.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“From all this necessarily flowed a limited liability of the associates. Since only the entity was liable for debts, which did not attach to the various individuals, it followed that a stockholder was not normally liable for any of the debts of the enterprise; and he could thus embark a particular amount of capital in the corporate affairs without becoming responsible beyond this amount, for the corporate debts.”&lt;ref&gt;120&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the United States, particularly at the time Berle and Means were writing&lt;ref&gt;For the position today, see §141(k) [[DGCL]] and equivalents&lt;/ref&gt; they noted two things which particularly compromised shareholder's power: vote by proxy and restrictions on removing directors.&lt;ref&gt;129&lt;/ref&gt; So far as for what objectives the company pursues they say,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“The present corporation’s objects and the nature of the business in which (so far as the charter goes) it can engage are commonly limited only by the imagination of its organizing attorneys and their ability to embrace the world within the limits of the English language.”&lt;ref&gt;130&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===II Power over participation accruing to shares of stock===
"The conclusion that can be drawn (from this chapter) is that the share of stock, while it represents a participation in corporate assets, does so subject to so many qualifications that the distinctness of the property right has been blurred to the point of invisibility. For protection the stockholder has only a set of expectations that the men who compose the management and control will deal fairly with his interest. He must rely for the most part not on legal rights but on economic significances – on an accumulation of conditions which will make it desirable or advantageous for the purposes of the administration of the corporation to recognize a participation more or less meeting his expectation."

===III Power over the routing of earnings as between shares of stock===

===IV Power to alter the original contract rights of security holders===

===V The legal position of management===

===VI The legal position of "control“===

===VII Corporate powers as powers in trust===

===VIII The resultant position of the stockholder===
Berle and Means contrast the position of the owner of shares (passive property) and the owner of a horse (an example of active property). The one with the horse is ‘married’ to his physical property and must take responsibility for it. The stockholder's position is different.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“The liquidity of property thus turns upon the determination of a market price and the mechanism for such price-determining is the open market. Curious as it may seem, the fact appears to be that liquid property, at least under the corporate system, obtains a set of values in exchange, represented by market prices, which are not immediately dependent upon, or at least only obliquely connected with, the underlying values of the properties themselves.”&lt;ref&gt;249-250&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Book III, Property in the Stock Markets==
Book III's full title is "Property in the Stock Markets: Security exchanges as appraisers and liquidators".

===I The function of the public market===

===II Flotation and bankers' disclosure===

===III Disclosure by the corporation to the market===

===IV Management in the market===

==Book IV, Reorientation of Enterprise==
Book IV, entitled "Reorientation of Enterprise: Effects of the corporate system on fundamental economic concepts" is the shortest and aims to reassess some basic concepts in economic theory in light of the emergence of the corporation.

===I The traditional logic of property===
The traditional logic of property is that one will get all the gains and bear the losses associated with ownership. But now, since ownership has been separated from control, this no longer holds true.

===II The traditional logic of profits===
The traditional logic of profits, say Berle and Means, is that one will be motivated by the prospect of profiting from one's property. But again, with the separation of ownership from control, it is possible for managers to profit without working in shareholders' interests.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Where such a separation is complete one group of individuals, the security holders and in particular the stockholders, performs the function of risk-takers and suppliers of capital, while a separate group exercises control and ultimate management. In such a case, if profits are to be received only by the security holders, as the traditional logic of property would require, how can they perform both of their traditional economic roles? Are no profits to go to those who exercise control and in whose hands the efficient operation of enterprise ultimately rests? ...Furthermore, if all profits are earmarked for the security holder, where is the inducement for those in control to manage the enterprise efficiently? When none of the profits are to be received by them, why should they exert themselves beyond the amount necessary to maintain a reasonably satisfied group of stockholders.”&lt;ref&gt;301&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===III The inadequacy of traditional theory===
Berle and Means go right back here to [[Adam Smith]]'s oft cited disdain for joint stock companies, the idea that "negligence and profusion" would always prevail.&lt;ref&gt;304&lt;/ref&gt; They again emphasise the distinction between active and passive property.&lt;ref&gt;305&lt;/ref&gt;

===IV The new concept of the corporation===
This concluding part brings together the general thesis of the book. They finish by saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The rise of the modern corporation has brought a concentration of economic power which can compete on equal terms with the modern state - economic power versus political power, each strong in its own field. The state seeks in some aspects to regulate the corporation, while the corporation, steadily becoming more powerful, makes every effort to avoid such regulation... The future may see the economic organism, now typified by the corporation, not only on an equal plane with the state, but possibly even superseding it as the dominant form of social organization. The law of corporations, accordingly, might well be considered as a potential constitutional law for the new economic state, while business practice is increasingly assuming the aspect of economic statesmanship.”&lt;ref&gt;313&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''''New Age of Innovation: Driving Cocreated Value Through Global Networks''''' ({{ISBN|9780071598286}}) is a book by [[University of Michigan]] [[Ross School of Business]] Professors [[C. K. Prahalad]] and [[M. S. Krishnan]] published in April 2008.  The book outlines a new strategic path for companies in the 21st century.

== Book Summary ==
In the first chapter, Prahalad and Krishnan outline their central [[thesis]]; that there are new managerial demands in business, requiring new sources of value creation.  They argue that these demands have created an N=1 and R=G environment, where companies need to customize their product for each customer by gaining access to a new array of suppliers.

The book argues that the old sources of [[competitive advantage]] -technology, labor, and capital – are fading and that new sources are emerging.  Prahalad and Krishnan suggest an internal capacity to reconfigure resources in real time by focusing on clearly documented, transparent, and resilient [[business processes]] (the link between strategy, business models and operations) has become a strong differentiator.  They also argue that a focus on [[co-creation]], by developing an R=G supply network and emphasizing analytics which identify trends and unique opportunities can create a strong competitive advantage. The technical architecture required to develop these flexible and resilient business processes and strong analytics capabilities is outlined in the book. 

The last four chapters describe how to implement these new strategies.  Recognizing that many companies have fragmented and archaic systems, the book describes typical problems that occur when migrating to an N=1 and R=G friendly system.  Prahalad and Krishnan emphasize the importance of a social architecture with strong linkages between managers and the technical architecture.  They also outline the necessity for companies to recruit new skills from around the world and use [[globalization]] to its advantage.

== Key Concepts ==

The book argues that "the industrial system as we know it has been morphing for some time. Now it may have reached an inflection point.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newageofinnovation.com/blog/archives/2008/04/the_inflection.html&lt;/ref&gt; Prahalad and Krishnan outline the approach that firms in the new economy must take to survive and become successful.  The previous choice between low cost and differentiation is rarely the chief strategic choice anymore, firms must achieve what Prahalad and Krishnan call N=1 and R=G.

=== N=1 ===
N=1 requires companies to focus on the importance of individual customer experiences and tailor their product accordingly.  It requires that companies have resilient, dynamic and flexible business processes.  They also emphasize the importance of strong analytics which allow management to discover trends and unique opportunities and enable the company to engage in product [[co-creation]] with their consumer base.

=== R=G ===
R=G advises firms take a horizontal approach to supply rather than [[vertical integration]].  The focus is on obtaining access, rather than ownership, to resources from an array of suppliers both inside and outside the firm.  R=G provides the best opportunity for firms to leverage the necessary resources to co-create a personalized experience for each customer.  R=G is often mistaken as a suggestion to [[outsource]], however this is often not the case, as there are many notable instances where it makes sense for companies to leverage local resources to fulfill a personalized demand model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newageofinnovation.com/blog/archives/2008/04/does_rg_equal_o.html New Age Of Innovation | Does R=G Equal Outsourcing? Not Necessarily | C.K. Prahalad &amp; M.S. Krishnan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The subject of a London Chamber was first discussed in early 1906, when a number of meetings regarding the arrangement of a Swedish exhibition, led to the establishment of the Swedish Chamber of Commerce in London. The Certificate of Incorporation was granted by the Board of Trade and offices were hired at 136, Fenchurch Street. At the end of 1907 no less than 189 members had been elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scc.org.uk/about/history/|title=Swedish Chamber of Commerce {{!}} History|website=www.scc.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5239">'''Antonio "Tony" Chua''' (1965-September 26, 2009) was a [[Filipino Chinese]] businessman. His family owns Photokina Marketing Corporation, which distributed [[Red Bull]] in the Philippines; he managed and was the governor of the [[Barako Bull Energy Boosters (2000-2011)|Barako Bull Energy Boosters]], the company's team in the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] (PBA) in which he previously served as chairman. Chua also served as vice president of [[Philippine Football Federation]] (PFF); he previously played high school varsity football for [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]].

Chua died at the height of [[Typhoon Ketsana (2009)|Tropical Storm Ketsana]] (local name: Ondoy).

==Early life and career==
Chua studied in Colegio de San Juan de Letran up to college, graduating in 1975. He played for the [[Letran Knights|Letran Squires]] football team and was known as "Mr. Football."&lt;ref name="BusinessMirror"&gt;{{cite news|first=Joel |last=Orellana |title=Former P.B.A. chairman Tony Chua drowns in Ondoy’s floodwaters |url=http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/home/sports/16527-former-pba-chairman-tony-chua-drowns-in-ondoys-floodwaters.html |publisher=[[Business Mirror]] |date=2009-09-27 |accessdate=2009-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930054525/http://businessmirror.com.ph/home/sports/16527-former-pba-chairman-tony-chua-drowns-in-ondoys-floodwaters.html |archivedate=September 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chua coached the [[Philippine women's national football team]], and later served as vice president of the PFF.&lt;ref name="GMA"&gt;{{cite news|title=Barako Bull manager among 'Ondoy' casualties |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/173285/barako-bull-manager-among-ondoy-casualties |publisher=GMAnews.tv |date=2009-09-27 |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basketball manager==
Chua's company Photokina Marketing Corporation fielded the [[Barako Bull Energy Boosters (2000-2011)|Red Bull]] to the semiprofessional [[Philippine Basketball League]] (PBL), and he was tasked to manage the team. Then PBL commissioner [[Yeng Guiao]] allowed the team to compete, and the team won several championships.&lt;ref name="BusinessMirror"/&gt;

When the Photokina franchise entered the professional [[Philippine Basketball Association]] (PBA) as Batang Red Bull, Chua appointed Guiao as the coach of the team. Guiao led the Red Bull team to three championships: the 2001 and 2002 Commissioner's Cups, and the [[2006 PBA Fiesta Conference|2006 Fiesta Conference]].&lt;ref name="BusinessMirror"/&gt;

After [[Noli Eala]] resigned as PBA commissioner, Chua as chairman of the board of governors ran the daily affairs of the league while a replacement was being found. When [[Sonny Barrios]] was appointed as interim commissioner, Chua personally welcomed Barrios on his first day on the job.&lt;ref name="BusinessMirror"/&gt;

After the [[2008–09 PBA Philippine Cup|2008–09 Philippine Cup]], Guiao resigned and the team was renamed as the Barako Bull Energy Boosters. Guiao was later signed as head coach of the [[Burger King Whoppers]] but the two remained close.&lt;ref name="BusinessMirror"/&gt;

Among his projects in the PBA is the [[PBA Hall of Fame]]; he was one of the selectors for the third batch which were announced in 2009.&lt;ref name="BusinessMirror"/&gt;

==Death==
At the height of [[Typhoon Ketsana (2009)|Tropical Storm Ketsana (Ondoy)]], traffic was not moving and he and his driver and Barako Bull liaison officer aides alighted their car. The three trekked the flooded road when a strong current engulfed them, sucking away the driver; Chua can only look at his aide as his body faded out of sight. The two decided to stop and hold on to a tree when a truck carrying lumber passed by, the lumber that jutted out of the truck hit Chua in the face. The details right after he was hit by the lumber weren't clear; he could have died because of [[hypothermia]] or from [[internal hemorrhage]], for he was bleeding from the ears. His liaison officer caught up with him and tried to revive him, but he died on the way. The driver's body was fished out of the waters two days after the storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Beth |last=Celis |url=http://sports.inquirer.net/columns/columns/view/20090930-227562/How-did-Tony-Chua-die |title=How did Tony Chua die? |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2009-09-30 |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction===
Sports officials were saddened by Chua's demise. Guiao was "deeply shocked" and remarked that Chua was "well liked by everyone in the basketball community". Guiao's successor as commissioner in the PBL Chino Trinidad said described Chua as "a funny guy" but "passionate in the game". PBA commissioner Barrios, who announced Chua's death to the press, was personally affected by Chua's death, saying that we always "worked well" with him.&lt;ref name="GMA"/&gt;

The '''Transamerica Pyramid''' at 600 Montgomery Street between Clay and Washington Streets in the [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]] of [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]], is a 48-story futurist building and the second-tallest [[skyscraper]] in the [[San Francisco skyline]]. Its height is surpassed by [[Salesforce Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=San Francisco's Salesforce Tower becomes tallest building on West Coast|url=http://abc7news.com/realestate/salesforce-tower-in-sf-becomes-tallest-building-on-west-coast-/1556148/|accessdate=December 24, 2016|publisher=[[ABC 7 News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building no longer houses the [[headquarters]] of the [[Transamerica Corporation]], which moved its U.S. headquarters to [[Baltimore, Maryland]], but it is still associated with the company and is depicted in the company's logo. Designed by architect [[William Pereira]] and built by Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company, at {{convert|853|ft}}, on completion in 1972 it was the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|eighth-tallest building in the world]].&lt;ref name=Emporis&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/sk/st/tp/wo/ | title=Official World's 200 Tallest High-rise Buildings | date=January 2010 | work=Emporis | accessdate=2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Transamerica building was commissioned by Transamerica CEO [[John R. (Jack) Beckett|John (Jack) R. Beckett]], with the claim that he wished to allow light in the street below. Built on the site of the historic [[Montgomery Block]], it has a structural height of {{convert|853|ft}} and has 48 [[storey|floors]] of [[retail]] and [[office]] space.

Construction began in 1969 and finished in 1972, and was overseen by San Francisco-based contractor Dinwiddie Construction, now Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company. Transamerica moved its headquarters to the new building from across the street, where it had been based in a [[wikt:flatiron|flatiron]]-shaped building now occupied by the [[Church of Scientology]] of San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientology.org/david-miscavige/churchopenings/san-francisco-a-scientology-new-church-in-a-world-class-city.html?video=org-sfo_tour A Landmark Church at the Golden Gates]. scientology.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the tower is no longer [[Transamerica Corporation]] headquarters, it is still associated with the company and is depicted in the company's logo. The building is evocative of San Francisco and has become one of the many symbols of the city.&lt;ref name=emblem&gt;{{cite news | author=Carolyn Said | title=Transamerica Pyramid From corporate emblem to city landmark | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/05/29/BUGO76TPTR1.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle  | date=May 29, 2004 | accessdate=2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by architect [[William Pereira]], it faced opposition during planning and construction and was sometimes referred to by detractors as "Pereira's Prick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sorkin | first=Michael | title=Exquisite Corpse: Writing on Buildings | location=New York; London | publisher=Vers0 | year=1991 | isbn=0-86091-323-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HfADWI2MnyIC&amp;lpg=PA295&amp;ots=FI8_LFcZ0t&amp;dq=%22pereira's%20prick%22&amp;pg=PA295#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pereira's%20prick%22&amp;f=false | accessdate=2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; John King of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' summed up the improved opinion of the building in 2009 as "an architectural icon of the best sort – one that fits its location and gets better with age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Pyramid-s-steep-path-from-civic-eyesore-to-icon-3277598.php#ixzz2TsY84YFr|title=Pyramid's steep path from civic eyesore to icon|author=King, John|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=December 27, 2009|accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; King also wrote in 2011 that it is "a uniquely memorable building, a triumph of the unexpected, unreal and engaging all at once. ... It is a presence and a persona, snapping into different focus with every fresh angle, every shift in light."&lt;ref name=cityscapes /&gt;

The Transamerica Pyramid was the tallest skyscraper west of Chicago when constructed, surpassing the then [[555 California Street|Bank of America Center]], also in San Francisco. It was surpassed by the [[Aon Center (Los Angeles)|Aon Center]],  [[Los Angeles]], in 1974.

The building is thought to have been the intended target of a terrorist attack, involving the hijacking of airplanes as part of the [[Bojinka plot]], which was foiled in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Irving, Reed Irvine and Kinkaid, Cliff  | work=Media Monitor  | title=Bojinka Back In The News| url=http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/bojinka-back-in-the-news | publisher=Accuracy in Media | date=March 28, 2002 | accessdate=2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Transamerica was acquired by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] insurance company [[Aegon N.V.|Aegon]]. When the non-insurance operations of Transamerica were later sold to [[GE Capital]], Aegon retained ownership of the building as an investment.&lt;ref name=emblem/&gt;

The Transamerica Pyramid was the tallest skyscraper in San Francisco from 1972 to 2017, when it was surpassed by the under-construction [[Salesforce Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/04/07/salesforce-remakes-san-francisco-skyline-with-tallest-west-coast-office-tower/|title=Salesforce remakes San Francisco skyline with tallest West Coast office tower|date=2017-04-07|website=The Mercury News|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The land use and zoning restrictions for the parcel limited the number of square feet of office that could be built upon the lot, which sits at the north boundary of the financial district.

The building is a tall, four-sided pyramid with two "wings" to accommodate an elevator shaft on the east and a stairwell and a smoke tower on the west.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; The top {{Convert|212|ft|m}} of the building is the spire.&lt;ref name="DK California 2014"/&gt; There are four cameras pointed in the four cardinal directions at the top of this spire forming the "Transamerica Virtual Observation Deck."  Four monitors in the lobby, whose direction and zoom can be controlled by visitors, display the cameras' views 24 hours a day. An observation deck on the 27th floor was closed: the Pyramid's official website says that it was closed to the public in 2001&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pyramidcenter.com/tourism/history/ HISTORY] - Transamerica Pyramid Center. Retrieved 2018-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt;, while the [[New York Times]] reported that it has been closed "[s]ince the late 1990s"&lt;ref&gt;Pellissier, Hank (Sept. 4, 2010). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/us/05bcintel.html Pyramid Redwood Park]". ''The New York Times''. Retrieved 2018-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt;. It was replaced by the virtual observation deck a few years later. The video signal from the "Transamericam" was used for years by a local TV news station for live views of traffic and weather in downtown San Francisco.

The top of the Transamerica Pyramid is covered with aluminum panels. During the [[Christmas]] holiday season, on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], and during the anniversary of 9/11, a brightly twinkling beacon called the "Crown Jewel" is lit at the top of the pyramid.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepyramidcenter.com/tourism/faq.htm |title=Transamerica Pyramid Center: Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Park ==
{{Expand section|history of the park|date=July 2018}}
At the base of the building is a small [[private park]] called Transamerica Redwood Park. It is generally open to the public during the daytime. A number of [[redwood trees]] were transplanted from the local area to this park when the tower was built.

==Specifications==
{{Refimprove|section|date=June 2018}}

* The building's façade is covered in crushed [[quartz]], giving the building its light color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Foster | first=L. | title=The Photographer's Guide to San Francisco: Where to Find Perfect Shots and How to Take Them | publisher=Countryman Press | series=The Photographer's Guide | year=2011 | isbn=978-1-58157-831-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMlYbZ6xPXkC&amp;pg=PA34 | access-date=July 5, 2018 | page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The building's foundation is {{Convert|9|ft|m}} thick, the result of a 3-day, 24-hour [[slip forming|continuous concrete pour]].  Several thousand dollars in coins were thrown into the pit by observers surrounding the site at street level during the pouring, for good luck. {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* Only two of the building's 18 elevators reach the top floor.
* The original proposal was for a {{Convert|1150|ft|m|adj=mid}} building, which for a year would have been the second-tallest completed building in the world. The proposal was rejected by the city planning commission, saying it would interfere with views of [[San Francisco Bay]] from [[Nob Hill, San Francisco, California|Nob Hill]].&lt;ref name=Emporis /&gt;

[[File:ZF Campus.jpg|thumb|''ZF Campus'']]

'''Zeppelin University''' (German: ''Zeppelin Universität'', '''ZU''') is a small and highly selective&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/zeppelin-universitaet-ist-bekannt-fuer-ihr-hartes-auswahlverfahren-a-875602.html|title=Zeppelin Universität ist bekannt für ihr hartes Auswahlverfahren|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=17 April 2013|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zu.de/mediathek/video/2014/imagefilm-pioneers-wanted-auswahltag.php|title=Mediathek|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; private [[research university]] located at [[Lake Constance]] in [[Friedrichshafen]], [[Germany]]. It is named after the German general and airship constructor [[Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin]], whose foundation is the main financier of Zeppelin University.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the official status, see [http://www.hochschulkompass.de/kompass/xml/download/hs_liste.txt ''Hochschulrektorenkonferenz, Hochschulkompass''] (German)&lt;/ref&gt; The university was established in 2003 and is known for its [[avant-garde]] character as well as for a sophisticated selection. On 10. September 2011, ZU was being bestowed the right to award [[doctorate]] and [[habilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs-kompass2.de/kompass/xml/akkr/80540_17594_de.htm|title=Akkreditierte Studiengänge - Zentrale Datenbank|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes along with the right to use the title "university" (German: ''Universität'').

== Overview ==
Zeppelin University has the legal form of a non-profit, limited liability organization and calls itself "university bridging business, culture and politics". Thus it stresses the multi-disciplinary character of research and teaching that is an integral part of its self-image. The university is accredited nationally by the Academic Council of the Federal Republic of Germany ([[Wissenschaftsrat]]). The undergraduate major courses are accredited by ACQUIN, a German higher education accreditation agency.

Zeppelin University has two main campuses in [[Friedrichshafen]]: One right on the banks of [[Lake Constance]] (the ''LakeCampus'' or ''SMH'') and the nearby ''ZFCampus'' (or ''FAB3''), which was built from 2013 to 2015 to create more space for the quickly growing university. Both campuses are modern, designed by well-known architects, and contain [[classroom]]s, [[lecture hall]]s, offices, [[cafeteria]]s, a [[library]] and a wing free to use solely by students. From 2007 to 2008 (until the closure of the airport), Zeppelin University had an additional location in the foyer of [[Tempelhof International Airport]] in Berlin, the so-called “Institute for the Art of Swimming on Air”. Since 2011, there is a campus in Berlin again (''CapitalCampus'').

There are several [[student group]]s and projects, such as groups affiliated with political parties (''LHG, Jusos, RCDS''), a debating club (''Soapbox''), the Club of International Politics (''CIP''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.international-politics.org/|title=CIP|website=CIP|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Model United Nations group (MUN), which also organizes ''LakeMun'', entrepreneurial groups, a cultural club which also organizes a music festival at the university (''SeeKult''), a student medical service, a filming group, several bands and many more - some of them are even known nationwide (e.g. ''RockYourLife''). In 2008, the student radio station ''Welle20'' went on air.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/das-studium/studentische-projekte.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection==
Applicants are selected by the university in an arduous two-step selection process: after a detailed written application, in which the first selection is made, the most auspicious candidates will be invited to an [[assessment centre|assessment day]] (''Pioneers Wanted''). Thereby, the candidates undergo a program consisting of several interviews with professors, students, [[alumni]], and external reviewers, as well as written tests. Furthermore, they have to accomplish a realistic project which is introduced by an associated organisation, whereby a problem has to be solved as a group and must be presented afterwards in front of the assessment committee.&lt;ref&gt;ZU: [https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/bewerbung-bachelor/bewerbung.php Application]&lt;/ref&gt;

The selection procedure of ZU is being considered as outstandingly sophisticated, also because of its deviating modalities compared to other universities: ZU deliberately refrain from the solely use of a [[numerus clausus]] (which is widely prevalent in German educational landscape), but instead tries to find personalities which - besides accomplishing the required performance - also fit to the university's character.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; Therefore, the university currently has an undergraduate acceptance rate, which is lower than 10% and a graduate acceptance rate of about 16%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeppelin-university.de/deutsch/zeppelinuniversity/facts_figures.php?navid=8|title=zu in zahlen|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses==
Students can graduate with the academic degree of a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A. with 240 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]) and a consecutive, as well as a non-consecutive, [[Master of Arts]] or [[Master of Science]] (M.A. / M.Sc. with 120 ECTS).

The university offers Bachelor courses in the field of [[Liberal arts education]]. Programs of Study are offered in:
* B.A. [[Sociology]], [[Political Science|Politics]] and [[Economics]] (SPE)
* B.A. [[Business administration|Corporate Management]] &amp; [[Economics]] (CME)
* B.A. [[Communication Science|Communication]] &amp; [[Cultural studies|Cultural Management]] (CCM) and
* B.A. [[Political Science|Politics]], [[Public administration|Administration]] &amp; [[International Relations]] (PAIR).&lt;ref&gt;ZU: [https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/ba-studium.php Bachelor-Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are Master programs in:
* M.Sc. Corporate Management &amp; Economics (CME)
* M.A. General Management (GEMA)
* M.A. Pioneering in Arts, Media &amp; the Creative Industries (AMC) and
* M.A. Politics, Administration &amp; International Relations (PAIR).&lt;ref&gt;ZU: [https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/ma-studium.php Master-Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the university offers several Executive Master programs (E.M.A.) in:
* E.M.A. Family Entrepreneurship (FESH)
* E.M.A. Digital Pioneering (DIP) and
* E.M.A. Business &amp; Leadership for Engineers and Mobility Innovations (BEL).&lt;ref&gt;ZU: [https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/weiterbildung/index.php?navid=880908880908 Weiterbildungs-Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tuition]] for the bachelor program amounts to 3,950.00 euro per semester or 675.00 euro per month, for the master programs from 4,000.00 euro to 4,900.00 euro per semester.&lt;ref&gt;ZU: [http://www.zu.de/deutsch/bewerberportal/bachelor/2010/gebuehren_BA_CME.php Tuition]&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous merit-based [[scholarship]]s by foundations and patrons as well as a student loan of ''[[Sparkasse]] Bodensee'' that is offered at a relatively low interest rate and is used by more than half of the students.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.brandeins.de/archiv/2005/freiheit/am-strand-der-guten-hoffnung.html Am Strand der guten Hoffnung]'', in: [[brand eins]], January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting from Fall Semester 2011, Zeppelin University reorganized all of their undergraduate degree programmes, converting them into 4-year programs. The additional year is intended to be used as "Humboldt-year", a one-year research project at one of the partner universities. Accordingly, it has cooperation agreements for example with [[University of California]], Berkeley, with [[Sciences Po]] in Paris, with [[Copenhagen Business School]] as well as with [[Goldsmiths College]], London.&lt;ref&gt;ZU: [http://www.zu.de/deutsch/bewerberportal/bachelor/ZU_Bachelorbroschuere_05_2011.pdf Info-brochure] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217023856/http://www.zu.de/deutsch/bewerberportal/bachelor/ZU_Bachelorbroschuere_05_2011.pdf |date=February 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rankings==
Zeppelin University is a small and exclusive&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; private university and offers fewer programs than traditional universities in Germany. Due to its young age and small size, it typically goes unranked in international comparisons. Nevertheless, it has reached remarkable results in German Rankings: In the magazine ''Handelsblatt Karriere'', edition 07/08 dated April 27, 2007, Zeppelin University has appeared in a university ranking for the first time. It has instantly reached eighth place with its economic program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idw-online.de/pages/en/news?id=206668|title=Zeppelin University unter den Top 10 der deutschen Unis|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most reputable German Ranking, the ''CHE University Ranking'', which was published by ''ZEIT Studienführer'' 2014/15, the university was able to reach the first place with “Corporate Management &amp; Economics” (CME), while [https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/pair/index.php?navid=538739538739 Politics, Administration &amp; International Relations (PAIR)] was ranked among the three best Political Science programs. In 2011/12 the Communication &amp; Cultural Management program was ranked first place by ''CHE''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zu.de/universitaet/rankings.php|title=Rankings|website=www.zu.de|language=de|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sociology, Politics, and Economics degree is not ranked, due to its multidisciplinarity.

In 2014, the university was listed in an international ranking for the first time: in the ''U-Multirank'' it gained the best grade "excellent".

==Staff ==
[[Stephan A. Jansen]] has managed ZU since its foundation and was (age 32 at that time) thereby the youngest university president in history.

Well-known professors include: [[Nico Stehr]], [[Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht]], [[Helmut Willke]], [[:de:Joachim Behnke|Joachim Behnke]], Georg Jochum, [[Richard Münch (sociologist)|Richard Münch]], [[:de:Jörn von Lucke|Jörn von Lucke]], [[Lucia A. Reisch]]. In 2016, [[Daniel Dahm]] joined ZU as vice director of the European Center for Sustainability Research. In August 2007, [[Birger Priddat]] was appointed president and managing director of the [[Witten/Herdecke University]].
