'''A Night of Appreciation ''' was a [[professional wrestling]] benefit show held to raise funds for [[United States|American]] professional wrestler [[Sabu (wrestler)|Terry "Sabu" Brunk]], who had incurred costly medical bills while hospitalized for several months after contracting a mysterious [[virus]] that at one point left him temporarily paralyzed.&lt;ref name="COE1"/&gt; The event took place on December 12, 2004 in the Diamondback Saloon in [[Belleville, Michigan]], and was organized by [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Professional wrestling promotion|professional wrestling promoter]] [[Scott D'Amore]], veteran [[Manager (professional wrestling)|professional wrestling manager]] [[Jimmy Hart]] and [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]], a close friend of Sabu.&lt;ref name="COE1"/&gt;

==Event==
The event was attended by approximately 700 people, with some turned away due to insufficient capacity. Tickets were priced at [[United States dollar|$]]15 for adults and $10 for children, with [[Very Important Person (person)|VIP]] tickets (entailing select seating and access to an [[autograph]] session) priced at $30. The event was later released on [[DVD]].&lt;ref name="COE2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COE3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/11/25/729848.html|last=Clevett|first=Jason|title=Show set to support Sabu|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|accessdate=2007-05-24|date=2004-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Master of Ceremonies]] was Jimmy Hart, and the ring announcer was "Irish" Bobby Clancy. The matches featured wrestlers from D'Amore's [[Windsor, Ontario]]-based [[Border City Wrestling]] (BCW) promotion, wrestlers from [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), where Sabu was employed before being hospitalized, and friends of Sabu such as the [[Insane Clown Posse]] and fellow [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] alumni [[Shane Douglas]], Raven and [[Mick Foley]].&lt;ref name="COE1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COE2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COE3"/&gt;

Every performer worked for free and paid their own travel costs, while the building used, the lighting and sound equipment and the ring itself were all provided without charge. In addition, several wrestlers and fans donated items that were subsequently [[auction]]ed or [[raffle]]d, including a [[World Championship Wrestling]] [[t-shirt]] signed by [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]] and [[Kevin Nash]], and a [[Dimensional lumber|two by four]] signed by [[Jim Duggan]].&lt;ref name="COE2"/&gt;

The proceeds of the event were given entirely to Sabu, who went on to make a complete recovery, and returned to the ring on May 21, 2005.&lt;ref name="OWW1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/sabu.html|title=Sabu|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-05-24|quote=May 21, 2005--All World Wrestling League: Sabu (1st match in 10 months) defeated N8 Mattson.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070518074155/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/sabu.html| archivedate= 18 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''All the world's a stage'''" is the phrase that begins a [[monologue]] from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[As You Like It]]'', spoken by the [[Jaques (As You Like It)|melancholy Jaques]] in Act II Scene VII Line 138. The speech compares the world to a stage and life to a play and catalogues the seven stages of a man's life, sometimes referred to as the '''seven ages of man''':&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qqPLVyh6KLYC Shakespeare's Seven Ages of Man]. By [[William Shakespeare]]. Van Voorst, 1848. (Also, [https://books.google.com/books?id=O19WAAAAYAAJ L. Booth and S. Ayling, 1864] Version.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[infant]], [[schoolboy]], [[love]]r, [[soldier]], [[Judge|justice]], [[Pantalone]], and [[old age]], facing imminent death. It is one of Shakespeare's most frequently quoted passages.

==Text==
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;{{pad|9em}}
All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Origins==
[[File:Seven ages of man.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Seven Ages of Man'' by [[William Mulready]], 1838, illustrating the speech]]

===World as a stage===
The comparison of the world to a stage and people to actors long predated Shakespeare. [[Juvenal]], the ancient Roman poet, wrote one of the earliest versions of this line in his “Satire 3”: “All of Greece is a stage, and every Greek’s an actor.” &lt;ref&gt;Wender, Dorothy. “Roman Poetry: From the Republic to the Silver Age. Carbondale: Southern Illinois Univ. Press, 1980. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Richard Edwardes|Richard Edwards]]' play ''[[Damon and Pythias (play)|Damon and Pythias]]'', written in the year Shakespeare was born, contains the lines, "Pythagoras said that this world was like a stage / Whereon many play their parts; the lookers-on, the sage".&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Quincy Adams]], ''Chief Pre-Shakespearean Dramas: A Selection of Plays Illustrating the History of the English Drama from Its Origin down to Shakespeare'', Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston; New York, 1924, p. 579.&lt;/ref&gt; When it was founded in 1599 Shakespeare's own theatre, [[Globe Theatre|The Globe]], may have used the motto ''{{lang|la|Totus mundus agit histrionem}}'' (All the world plays the actor), the Latin text of which is derived from a 12th-century treatise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marjorie B. Garber|authorlink=Marjorie Garber|title=Profiling Shakespeare|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately the words derive from ''{{lang|la|quod fere totus mundus exercet histrionem}}'' (because almost the whole world are actors) attributed to [[Petronius]], a phrase which had wide circulation in England at the time.

In his own earlier work, ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', Shakespeare also had one of his main characters, [[Antonio (The Merchant of Venice)|Antonio]], comparing the world to a stage:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
A stage where every man must play a part,
And mine a sad one.&lt;/poem&gt;|Act I, Scene I}}

In his work ''[[The Praise of Folly]]'', first printed in 1511, Renaissance humanist [[Erasmus]] asks, "For what else is the life of man but a kind of play in which men in various costumes perform until the director motions them off the stage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Masters|title=The Essential Erasmus|publisher=[[New American Library|The New American Library]]|year=1956|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ages of man===
Likewise the division of human life into a series of ages was a commonplace of art and literature, which Shakespeare would have expected his audiences to recognize. The number of ages varied: three and four being the most common among ancient writers such as [[Aristotle]]. The concept of seven ages derives from mediaeval philosophy, which constructed groups of seven, as in the [[seven deadly sins]], for theological reasons. The seven ages model dates from the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. A. Burrow|title=The Ages of Man: A Study in Medieval Writing and Thought|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]]|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] had a tapestry illustrating the seven ages of man.&lt;ref&gt;''PROME'', 1423 October, item 31, entries 757–797, quoted in Ian Mortimer, ''1415 – Henry V's Year of Glory'', p. 45, footnote 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to T. W. Baldwin, Shakespeare's version of the concept of the ages of man is based primarily upon [[Palingenius]]' book ''Zodiacus Vitae'', a school text he would have studied at the Stratford Grammar School, which also enumerates stages of human life. He also takes elements from [[Ovid]] and other sources known to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Whitfield Baldwin|title=William Shakspere's Small Latine and Lesse Greeke|volume=1|location=Urbana, Ill.|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|year=1944|pages=652–673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story centres on the legacy of a dead Indian underworld [[Crime boss|don]] Baba Baldev Prasad ([[Om Puri]]), who dies of a heart attack. He leaves a [[diamond]]s worth $200mn at the New York Bank, to be distributed equally between his son Vikrant ([[Rahul Dev]]), his daughter Preeti ([[Preeti Jhangiani]]), and Preeti's husband Guru Gulab Khatri ([[Akshay Kumar]]). To claim the diamonds, all three benefactors must be present at the bank or, if dead, their death certificates must be presented.

Shortly after the Don's death, Vikrant attempts to eliminate Guru by assassinating the Indian home minister in full view of [[television]] cameras while disguised as him. Guru flees to the US disguised as someone else to escape prosecution. Guru moves to the street where Anmol ([[Aftab Shivdasani]]) and his family live. Anmol recognizes him from the news. His mother-in-law ([[Supriya Pilgaonkar]]) forces him to go to India, along with his father-in-law, Manilal ([[Paresh Rawal]]) to tell Vikrant about Guru and get the reward. But everything turns wrong when Vikrant doesn't give the reward and instead sends Anmol and Manilal back to the USA with his hired men, Yeda Anna ([[Sunil Shetty]]) and Chota Chathri ([[Johnny Lever]]) to kill Guru. Later, they find out that Yeda Anna was a double agent: He was working for Guru the whole time because he offered more money. The group receive Vikrant and Preeti at the airport and drive to the hotel. At the hotel, Vikrant is kidnapped by a mysterious group of Chinese goons. Yeda Anna receives a phone call and finds out that the kidnapped Vikrant was a duplicate of the real one and the real one was going to come later by plane. They kill the second Vikrant and put his body in a car by the Brooklyn Bridge.

With Vikrant's death, Preeti and Guru each get half of the diamonds. When they are outside the bank, a group of policemen arrest them and take them to an unknown desert area. It is revealed that Vikrant is still alive and the first Vikrant was kidnapped by Chinese goons. Vikrant gets the diamonds and tries to kill Guru. A fight occurs. At the end of the fight, Guru kills Vikrant. When it's all over, they ask each other to find out who has the diamonds. Anmol has them and says he will give them to Guru if he gives Preeti a divorce. Guru arrives at the location selected by Anmol and gets the diamonds, while giving Anmol the divorce papers. Yeda Anna betrays Guru and tries to steal the diamonds. Guru wins in a fight and gives the diamonds to Yeda Anna while hanging him to a bar and having him stand on Chota Chathri's shoulders. In the end, Anmol and his love, Preeti, are seen going to India. Anmol's ex-father-in-law gives him some diamonds that he received from Guru. Preeti comments that she didn't know that Guru was so nice.

'''''Balibo''''' is a 2009 Australian [[war film]] that follows the story of the [[Balibo Five]], a group of [[journalist]]s who were captured and killed while reporting on activities just prior to the [[Indonesia]]n [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] of [[East Timor]] of 1975. While historically accurate, the film is loosely based on the book ''Cover-Up'' by [[Jill Jolliffe]], an Australian journalist who met the men before they were killed.

The film follows dishevelled journalist [[Roger East (journalist)|Roger East]], played by [[Anthony LaPaglia]], who travels to [[East Timor]] in 1975 to investigate the deaths of the Balibo Five during the buildup to the [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor]].&lt;ref name="lapaglia"&gt;{{cite web

LaPaglia, also an Executive Producer, named East as "probably the best role I've ever had".&lt;ref name="screendaily.com"&gt;http://www.screendaily.com/balibo/5003445.article&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story is seen through the eyes of veteran journalist [[Roger East (journalist)|Roger East]]. Introduced as a once-fearless foreign correspondent now working in [[public relations|PR]] in Darwin, East is drawn to East Timor by [[José Ramos-Horta]] of [[Fretilin]]; then the fledgling republic's charismatic young secretary of foreign affairs. Initially refusing to become involved, East changes his tune after Ramos-Horta shows him photos of five Australian TV reporters missing in the border town of Balibo.

Vignettes then show [[Greg Shackleton]], Gary Cunningham, Malcolm Rennie, Brian Peters and Tony Stewart, all under 30, saying goodbye to loved ones and setting out on their assignments a month earlier.

Parallel action follows with the [[Balibo Five]] tracked from East Timor's capital to their terrifying end after filming the Indonesian advance, and East and Ramos-Horta retracing their steps through by now extremely dangerous territory. Shackleton's last surviving report is recreated: sitting in a village, he says its inhabitants don't know if they will be alive tomorrow and have asked him why no one in Australia or anywhere else will help.

Drawing attention to the techniques of news gathering and delivery in 1975, the film raises the idea of what might have happened had the [[Balibo Five]] not been cut off from communicating with the world and slowed by heavy 16mm film equipment.

Bookended by contemporary scenes of a fictional East Timorese woman remembering East and life under Indonesian occupation, the film closes with a tribute to the nation's rebirth in 1999 and the many tens of thousands of lives lost in the struggle for independence.&lt;ref name="screendaily.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="variety.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117940728.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Balibo Movie Review | first=Richard | last=Kuipers | date=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gritty 16mm-to-35mm visuals shot at the actual locations where the events took place give a documentary-style texture.&lt;ref name="variety.com"/&gt;

The film's version of events was validated by an Australian coroner in 2007. After a fresh review of the evidence, the coroner ruled that the journalists were executed as they tried to surrender to Indonesian forces.
The filmmakers hope that [[Balibo]] will spur the Australian government into action. Almost 18 months on, it has not responded to the coroner's findings - a reticence which may stem from its fear of upsetting diplomatic relations with Jakarta.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8166417.stm | work=BBC News | title=Indonesia 'tortured' Balibo Five | date=24 July 2009 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Connolly]] said that he did not set out to provoke Jakarta but wanted to examine a seminal moment in Indonesia's 24-year occupation of East Timor, when an estimated 183,000 people died: "I think it had to be graphic because otherwise you dangerously dilute what happened."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/07/22/2633213.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives a score of 100% based on 11 reviews, 81% of audiences like the film.&lt;ref name="tomatoes"&gt;{{Rotten Tomatoes|balibo|Balibo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Balibo'' received its world premiere at the [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] on 24 July 2009 at Melbourne's Hamer Hall. The then President of [[East Timor]], [[José Ramos-Horta]] was in attendance and an address alleged that the Balibo Five were tortured and killed by Indonesian forces. On changes over recent years in Indonesia Ramos-Horta said "It is better. Indonesian democracy today is one of the most inspiring in the south-east Asia region."&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Also in attendance were the families of the Balibo Five. Relatives of Tony Stewart held aloft a banner bearing his name which had been embroidered by East Timorese women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/photogallery/entertainment/balibo-premiere/20090725-dwdy.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Balibo premiere}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maureen Tolfree, sister of Brian Peters, said she hoped many Australians would see the film and that she thought "...it will bring to the Australian public what's gone on," she said.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/07/24/2636064.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Richard Kuipers dubbed the film "a tense, character-driven thriller with political comment on the side, allowing viewers with little or no prior knowledge of the subject matter to engage instinctively with the [[Balibo Five]]," filmed where it happened and "packing a huge emotional punch". Kuipers continues: "LaPaglia is particularly good as the weary scribe who slowly rediscovers his old fire, and Isaac sparks off him impressively as the younger man whose ability to read people is as sharp as his political acumen."&lt;ref name="variety.com"/&gt;

''[[Screen International]]''{{'}}s Frank Hatherley opined: "Shot on location with loving attention to period detail, the film's take on these long-buried events is convincing. Connolly's three strands are expertly woven together, coming to twin climaxes where terror and cruelty overwhelm everyone. These ‘killing field' scenes are not for the squeamish."&lt;ref name="screendaily.com"/&gt;

''[[The Monthly]]''{{'}}s  [[Luke Davies]] wrote: "Jill Jollife's book ... argues that the Australian government has always known the exact circumstances of the newsmen's deaths. Connolly doesn't try to answer such questions, but rather lets them echo in the film."  Davies commended Connolly and co-screenwriter [[David Williamson]] for having "crafted an engaging film in which we come to care about the destiny of an entire people as well as for individual characters", and that "the film's denouement is terrifying", making it a realistic and confronting experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themonthly.com.au/node/1846 Robert Connolly's 'Balibo'], Luke Davies, August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Box office==
''Balibo'' grossed $1,330,863 at the box office in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf ''Film Victoria - Australian Films at the Australian Box Office'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indonesian ban==
The film was to have premiered in Indonesia at the 2009 [[Jakarta International Film Festival]]. However, in advance of a private screening, the film was banned by the Indonesian Film Censorship Agency. Indonesian Foreign Minister [[Marty Natalegawa]] said the ban was to avoid a negative "global perception of Indonesia". The [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|Indonesian military]] supported the ban, with a spokesman saying the film could harm Indonesia's relations with Timor Leste and Australia. He also repeated the official version of events, namely that the journalists were killed in a crossfire, and not by Indonesian troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Australian Film ‘Balibo’ Banned by Indonesian Censors | url = http://thejakartaglobe.com/home/australian-film-balibo-banned-by-indonesian-censors/344948 | publisher = [[The Jakarta Globe]] | date = 1 December 2009 | accessdate =1 December 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091205051235/http://thejakartaglobe.com/home/australian-film-balibo-banned-by-indonesian-censors/344948| archivedate= 5 December 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = ‘Balibo’ Ban Wins Rave Reviews From Indonesian Military |author= Markus Junianto Sihaloho &amp; Putri Prameshwari | url = http://thejakartaglobe.com/home/balibo-ban-wins-rave-reviews-from-indonesian-military/345194 | publisher = [[The Jakarta Globe]] | date = 2 December 2009 | accessdate =1 December 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091226171941/http://thejakartaglobe.com/home/balibo-ban-wins-rave-reviews-from-indonesian-military/345194| archivedate= 26 December 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Charles DeMott II''' (born November 10, 1966) is an American retired [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and [[Road agent (professional wrestling)|road agent]]. He is best known for his appearances with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) as '''Hugh Morrus''' and [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment]] (WWF/E) under his real name.&lt;ref name=WWEbio/&gt; DeMott also performed as '''Crash the Terminator''' in both [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) and [[Puroresu|Japan]].&lt;ref name=WWEbio/&gt; He was most recently the head trainer for WWE's [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental system]] [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] until his resignation in 2015 following allegations of misconduct, which he denied.

Generally used as a [[Job (professional wrestling)#Jobbers|jobber to the stars]] in WCW, he attained championship success during the promotion's dying days in late 2000 and early 2001, holding the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Championship]] [[List of WWE United States Champions|twice]]. After an unsuccessful stint as a performer in WWE, DeMott retired from in-ring competition and transitioned into the role of a trainer for the company's ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]'' program, on which he became known for using a rough, controversial style in handling trainees, as well as WWE's developmental territories [[Deep South Wrestling]], [[Florida Championship Wrestling]], and [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]].

==Early life==
William Charles DeMott II&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt; was born on November 10, 1966,&lt;ref name="OWOW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bill-demott.html|title=Bill DeMott|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221053236/http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bill-demott.html| archivedate= 21 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt; He grew up in [[Paramus, New Jersey]], graduating from [[Paramus High School]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Cecilia. [http://paramus.dailyvoice.com/neighbors/paramus-pro-wrestler-who-lost-daughter-has-new-purpose-end-drunk-driving/724831/ "Paramus Pro Wrestler Who Lost Daughter Has New Purpose: 'End Drunk Driving'"], Paramus Daily Voice, October 21, 2017. Accessed November 18, 2017. "Oct. 10, 2015 was the day life both stopped and started for Paramus native Bill DeMott.... DeMott graduated from Paramus High School in 1983, and went on to become a pro wrestler, earning himself the title of world heavyweight champion, and more."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1988–1994)===
DeMott was trained by [[Johnny Rodz]] in his [[New York City]] wrestling school beginning in 1988. From there he began working at small independent promotions using the name Big Sweet Williams. In 1992 DeMott began wrestling for the [[American Wrestling Federation]] and started using the [[ring name|name]] Crash the Terminator. Under this name he found some success, first capturing the AWF Heavyweight title from Steve Strong in [[Puerto Rico]], before moving on to the Japanese promotion W*ING and winning their World Tag Team Championship with [[Mr. Pogo]]. In 1993, while competing in W*ING, DeMott won a 16-man tournament to be crowned their World Heavyweight Champion.

When DeMott returned to the United States, he wrestled for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] for a short time under his Crash the Terminator name. On February 21, 1994 DeMott received a tryout match with the [[World Wrestling Federation]] at a [[Monday Night Raw]] taping at Poughkeepsie, NY. He also had matches over the next two days at taping for [[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]] and [[Wrestling Challenge]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling, where won the latter promotion's World Heavyweight Championship upon winning a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]].  Crash's final ECW appearance came on May 13, 1994, in a TV victory against AJ Powers, which aired on June 7.

===World Championship Wrestling (1995–2001)===

====The Dungeon of Doom and The First Family (1995–2000)====
{{Main|The First Family (professional wrestling)|l1=The First Family}}
In 1995, DeMott was signed to a [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) contract at the behest of [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] who had been impressed by him. He debuted in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]]es as The Man of Question and The Laughing Man, a strange [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] that saw him wearing a singlet covered in question marks and laughing frequently. He made his television debut as a member of [[The Dungeon of Doom]] as "The Laughing Man" Hugh Morrus (a [[pun]] on the word humorous) on the November 18, 1995 episode of WCW Saturday Night in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignette]] inside the Dungeon, where Kevin Sullivan told his ([[kayfabe]]) father, [[King Curtis Iaukea|The Master]], that he was giving him something he never had: laughter, and that he was giving him "the man from the Isle of Nowhere."

Upon the dissolution of the Dungeon of Doom, Morrus was relegated to the undercard. He gained the distinction of being the first wrestler to lose a televised match to [[Bill Goldberg]] during the September 22, 1997 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]''. As a part of the growing [[hardcore wrestling]] style in WCW, Morrus joined [[Jimmy Hart]]'s [[The First Family (professional wrestling)|First Family]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]]. Although the Family found success and received a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] following a victory over their rivals [[Revolution (professional wrestling)|The Revolution]], the stable was suddenly disbanded.

At this time, DeMott took some time off from WCW. He returned in early 2000, utilizing the same name and ring attire, but [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squashing]] a number of wrestlers as an angrier version of himself. The angry Morrus gimmick came to a halt when [[Vince Russo]] and [[Eric Bischoff]] took over and aimed to take WCW in a new direction.

====The Misfits In Action (2000–2001)====
{{Main|The Misfits In Action}}
After getting on Russo's bad side (in [[kayfabe]]), Morrus was fired from his [[The New Blood|New Blood]] stable along with a number of other wrestlers. These ex-New Blood members (including [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]) formed the comedic [[The Misfits In Action|Misfits In Action]] stable, which saw its members adopt both military-themed names and attires. As the stable's leader, Morrus re-christened himself General Hugh G. Rection, and led the group in a feud against [[The Filthy Animals]].

The group's comedic nature and the workrate of some of the wrestlers made the group immediate favorites with fans. Upon the introduction of the heel [[Team Canada (WCW)|Team Canada]], the Misfits In Action immediately began feuding with Team Canada, based over the patriotism both stables had for their respective countries. As the leader of the Misfits, Rection feuded with Team Canada's leader and [[WWE United States Championship|United States Heavyweight Champion]] [[Lance Storm]], with the two trading wins until Rection defeated both Storm and a [[turncoat]] [[Jim Duggan|"Hacksaw" Jim Duggan]] in a handicap match on October 29 at [[Halloween Havoc (2000)|Halloween Havoc]] to win the title. Rection would soon lose the title back to Storm on the November 13 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' before defeating Storm to regain the title on November 26 at [[Mayhem (2000)|Mayhem]].

After his feud with Storm, the next night on ''Nitro'', DeMott stood in the ring and spoke to the fans. During this segment, the WCW locker room emptied and many wrestlers from backstage stood on the entrance way clapping for DeMott; [[Bill Goldberg]] grabbed the microphone and, fondly recalling his first opponent in WCW, said "Hey, Goldberg's streak had to start somewhere, my friend."

At [[WCW Sin|Sin]] on January 14, 2001, Rection lost the United States Heavyweight Title to [[Shane Douglas]]. Following the title loss, the Misfits disbanded when Rection announced that they were [[Military discharge#Honorable|honorably discharged]], which led to Rection reverting to his Hugh Morrus name while the now former Misfits briefly feuded amongst each other. DeMott would then resume his pursuit of the United States Heavyweight Title until the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) bought out WCW.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001–2007)===

====The Alliance (2001–2002)====
When WCW was purchased by the WWF, DeMott signed a deal with the WWF and became part of [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] angle under his Hugh Morrus ring name as a member of [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]]. Morrus made his WWF debut on the June 4, 2001 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' by attacking [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. Aside from a [[pay-per-view]] match at [[WWF Invasion|Invasion]] on July 22 where he, [[Shawn Stasiak]] and [[Chris Kanyon]] defeated [[Big Show]], [[Billy Gunn]] and [[Matt Bloom|Albert]] and an [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] match on the August 27 episode of ''Raw'' which he lost to [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] via disqualification, Morrus was relegated to wrestling on the company's secondary shows ''[[WWE Heat|Heat]]'' and ''[[WWE Jakked/Metal|Jakked]]'' much like his fellow WCW alumni. In the September 29 episode of WWE Metal, Morrus made his first appearance at the show, where he takes on Billy Gunn, in a losing effort. When The Invasion ended at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] following Team Alliance's loss to Team WWF, Morrus was [[kayfabe]] fired by [[Vince McMahon]]. While off television, Morrus performed at [[house show]]s and worked in company's developmental territory [[Heartland Wrestling Association]] (HWA). During his time in the HWA, he teamed with [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] to defeat [[Lance Cade]] and [[Steve Bradley]] to win the [[HWA Tag Team Championship|Tag Team Champions]] on March 12, 2002, which they lost only three days later.

====SmackDown! (2002–2004)====
In April 2002, Morrus was drafted to the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]]. He made his television return on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Jakked/Metal|Jakked]]'' alongside fellow WCW alumnus [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]] and defeated [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]] and [[Shoichi Funaki|Funaki]]. Morrus was soon relegated to being a mainstay on ''Jakked'' and later ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]'' until late July 2002, when he was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Legit|legitimately]] injured in a motorcycle accident and had to take a leave of absence. During his time away, he became a trainer for the third season of ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]'', WWE's [[reality television]] show.

When he had sufficiently healed, Morrus made his return on the November 23 episode of ''Velocity'' under his real name. DeMott made his ''SmackDown!'' debut on December 5 as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], where he defeated Funaki in a [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squash]] match. The victory saw DeMott immediately receive a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] that saw him squash several established wrestlers, including Funaki, [[Shannon Moore]], [[Chuck Palumbo]], [[Crash Holly]], and [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] weekly on ''SmackDown!''. However, this came to an end soon and saw DeMott relegated back to ''Velocity'' beginning in February 2003. In May, DeMott made a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] that also saw him tell [[knock-knock joke]]s as part of the turn. As the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] failed to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Over|get over]], he remained on ''Velocity'' while continuing to win several squash matches. DeMott wrestled his last televised match on the June 14 episode of ''Velocity'', where he defeated fellow WCW alumnus [[Chris Kanyon]]. Later that month, DeMott retired from in-ring action, citing years of knee injuries. He then moved on to become the [[color commentator]] for ''Velocity'',&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=31|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning on the November 1 episode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_5901.shtml|title=10/11 WWE Velocity review: Bill Demott debuts on color commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained in that position until December 11, 2004.

====Deep South Wrestling (2004–2007)====
When ''[[WWE Tough Enough#$1,000,000 Tough Enough (Season 4)|Tough Enough 4]]'' wrapped production, DeMott did not make a return to ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]''. Instead, he became a full-time trainer for WWE and began working in the company's [[Deep South Wrestling]] developmental territory.&lt;ref name=DeMottFCW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/quicknews/article_62025.shtml|title=DeMott confirms FCW head trainer role}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeMott also worked as a booker for DSW, although his direction in the promotion received criticism, most notably by former WWE developmental wrestler [[Kenny Omega]], who soon requested to be released from his developmental contract due to poor treatment.&lt;ref name=DeMottFCW/&gt; DeMott was released from his WWE contract on January 19, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/archive/3877160223|title=WWE releases Superstars|accessdate=2007-12-23|date=2007-01-19|publisher=WWE| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071212063005/http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/archive/3877160223| archivedate= 12 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Tom Prichard]] taking his place as DSW's head trainer.

In March 2015, [[Devon Nicholson]] described an incident from 2006 that DeMott was involved with while he was head trainer for the WWE's [[Deep South Wrestling]] developmental territory. Nicholson described an incident where [[Drew Hankinson]] was completely naked in the ring for a long period of time and gave naked [[Professional wrestling attacks#Stink Face|stinkface]]s to [[Zack Ryder]] and [[Melissa Coates]] while DeMott held jelly donuts over their faces. The wrestlers agreed to do this (with the other talent encouraging them) to get out of regular training for that day.&lt;ref name="cagesideseats"&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris|first=Keith|url=http://www.cagesideseats.com/2012/12/9/3747940/head-wwe-trainer-bill-demott-twitter-attack-by-kevin-matthews|title=Head WWE trainer Bill DeMott attacked on Twitter by former trainee Kevin Matthews|work= |location= |publisher=''Cageside Seats''|date=December 9, 2012|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wrestlinginc"&gt;{{cite news |last=Giri|first=Raj|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2015/0307/590126/independent-wrestler-tells-gross-bill-demott-story-involving/|title=Independent Wrestler Tells Gross Bill DeMott Story Involving Zack Ryder And Female Wrestler (Video)|work= |location= |publisher=''WrestlingInc.com''|date=March 7, 2015|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wrestlezone"&gt;{{cite news |last=Paglino|first=Nick|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/559119-hannibal-tells-bizarre-bill-demott-story|title=Independent Wrestler Tells Bizarre Story of What Bill DeMott Once Made Zack Ryder &amp; Luke Gallows Do During Training|work= |location= |publisher=''Wrestle Zone''|date=March 7, 2015|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ewrestlingnews"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.ewrestlingnews.com/news/an-indy-wrestler-reveals-a-bizarre-story-on-bill-demott-in-wwe-developmental-video-inside|title=An Indy Wrestler Reveals A Bizarre Story On Bill DeMott In WWE Developmental - Video Inside|work= |location= |publisher=''eWrestlingNews.com''|date=March 7, 2015|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prowrestling"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.prowrestling.com/video-indy-wrestler-details-bizarre-bill-demott-incident/|title=VIDEO: Indy Wrestler Details A Bizarre Bill DeMott Incident|work= |location= |publisher=''ProWrestling.com''|date=March 7, 2015|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wrestlingnewsdepot"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lugo|first=Johnny|url=http://wrestlingnewsdepot.com/2015/03/wwe-news-latest-on-bill-demott-controversies-another-gross-story-surfaces/|title=WWE News: Latest On Bill DeMott Controversies, Another Gross Story Surfaces|work=|location=|publisher=''Wrestling News Depot''|date=March 12, 2015|accessdate=April 12, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412212616/http://wrestlingnewsdepot.com/2015/03/wwe-news-latest-on-bill-demott-controversies-another-gross-story-surfaces/|archivedate=April 12, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="411mania"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lee|first=Joseph|url=http://411mania.com/wrestling/independent-wrestler-tells-story-about-bizarre-thing-bill-demott-made-wrestlers-do/|title=Independent Wrestler Tells Story About Bizarre Thing Bill DeMott Made Wrestlers Do|work= |location= |publisher=''411MANIA''|date=March 7, 2015|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeMott refuted the notion that it was his idea, stating that the other trainees came up with because they wanted to skip the session.&lt;ref name="wrestlingrumors"&gt;{{cite news|last=Alba|first=Jon|url=http://www.wrestlingrumors.net/bill-demott-taken-twitter-respond-allegations/|title=Bill DeMott Has Taken to Twitter to Respond to Allegations|work=|location=|publisher=''Wrestling Rumours''|date=March 13, 2015|accessdate=April 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317232359/http://www.wrestlingrumors.net/bill-demott-taken-twitter-respond-allegations/|archive-date=2015-03-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wrestlingrevealed"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.wrestlingrevealed.com/articles/luke-gallows-absent|title=Luke Gallows absent|work=|location=|publisher=''Wrestling Revealed''|date=March 3, 2015|accessdate=April 12, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113141630/http://www.wrestlingrevealed.com/articles/luke-gallows-absent|archivedate=January 13, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent circuit (2007–2011)===
After parting ways with WWE, DeMott competed for several independent promotions, including the Carolina Wrestling Association and the United Wrestling Federation. In addition to wrestling, he also began operating his own wrestling school called New Energy Wrestling School from 2009 to 2010 in [[McDonough, Georgia]], while also running a brief series of wrestling events in [[Locust Grove, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;Personal conversation; Hall, A, March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to WWE (2011–2015)===
In 2011, [[WWE]] announced that DeMott would return to the company to perform as the head trainer on the [[WWE Tough Enough#Revival (Season 5)|revived ''Tough Enough'' series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.usanetwork.com/series/toughenough/theshow/characterprofiles/demott/|title=Tough Enough bio|access-date=2013-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216062844/http://www2.usanetwork.com/series/toughenough/theshow/characterprofiles/demott/|archive-date=2013-12-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the conclusion of ''Tough Enough'', DeMott replaced [[Tom Prichard]] as the head trainer for the [[Florida Championship Wrestling]] developmental territory on June 2, 2012.&lt;ref name=DeMottFCW/&gt; After FCW was rebranded into [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], DeMott retained his position as the head trainer, and continued in that role when the [[WWE Performance Center]] was opened in 2013. He was featured as a trainer in the [[WWE 2K15]] video game, however, also included his negative comments towards fictional and actual NXT trainees.

DeMott resigned from the company on March 6, 2015 following [[#Allegations of misconduct|widespread accusations of misconduct and abuse by a number of ex-trainees]], allegations which DeMott denied.&lt;ref name=NXTresign&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE News: Bill DeMott resigns, interim replacement (updated)|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/96-wwe-news/41510|accessdate=6 March 2015|website=f4wonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=complexsports&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paez-Pumar|first1=Luis|title=Bill DeMott, NXT, and the WWE's History of Abuse|url=http://www.complex.com/sports/2015/03/bill-demott-nxt-wwe-abuse|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- FOR EASY RECOGNITION, THE OTHER PEOPLE MENTIONED BELOW ARE LARGELY REFERRED TO BY THEIR NXT NAMES--&gt;Several former FCW, DSW, and NXT employees previously working within or with the WWE developmental system made public allegations of misconduct by DeMott during his time as trainer, including accusing DeMott of making trainees perform dangerous drills,&lt;ref name=devlin/&gt; physically [[assault]]ing and [[bullying]] trainees,&lt;ref name=devlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=traven/&gt; using [[homophobic]] and [[racial slurs]] amongst other [[Pejorative|derogatory terms]],&lt;ref name=traven/&gt;&lt;ref name=baxvan/&gt; letting trainees train while naked,&lt;ref name=devlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=nakedstinkface/&gt; and condoning [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref name=NXTresign/&gt; These allegations were made by Kevin Matthews, [[Mike Bucci]] and [[Devon Nicholson]] in 2012,&lt;ref name=nakedstinkface&gt;{{cite web|title=Devon Nicholson talks what really happened with the naked stinkface|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/component/content/article/28699-devon-nicholson-talks-what-really-happened-with-the-naked-stinkface|work=f4wonline.com|accessdate=March 4, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502002717/http://www.f4wonline.com/component/content/article/28699-devon-nicholson-talks-what-really-happened-with-the-naked-stinkface|archivedate=May 2, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foley heading overseas, Kevin Matthews continues to take aim at Bill DeMott, the return of Stone Cold E.T and lots more WWE notes|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=73752|website=pwinsider.com|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former developmental talent tweets controversial photo|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/38104|website=wrestleview.com|accessdate=March 4, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402095451/http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/38104|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chad Baxter and Chase Donovan in 2013,&lt;ref name=baxvan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=NXT investigation regarding claims made against Bill DeMott, statement issued by WWE|url=http://www.prowrestling.net/artman/publish/WWE/article10032254.shtml|website=prowrestling.net|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Curt Hawkins]] in 2014,&lt;ref name=complexsports/&gt; as well as several wrestlers including [[Judas Devlin]], [[Briley Pierce]], Brandon Traven, [[Derrick Bateman]] and independent wrestler Terra Calaway from late February to March 2015.&lt;ref name=NXTresign/&gt;&lt;ref name=devlin&gt;{{cite web|title=Heavy allegations levied against WWE's Bill DeMott, WWE's official response|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=92037|website=pwinsider.com|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=traven&gt;{{cite web|title=Second letter of allegations against WWE's Bill DeMott leaks online, Chris Jericho, EC3, others comment on situation|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=92051|website=pwinsider.com|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE News: Developmental head trainer is under fire again|url=http://prowrestling.net/article.php?WWE-News-Developmental-head-trainer-is-under-fire-again-41183|website=prowrestling.net|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devlin and Traven claimed to have submitted complaints to WWE management about DeMott in March 2013 when they were still employed with WWE, but only publicized the complaints in 2015.&lt;ref name=devlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=traven/&gt; WWE released statements regarding some of the claims that came to light in 2013 and 2015, claiming that investigations were done and no wrongdoing was found.&lt;ref name=devlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=baxvan/&gt; Pierce questioned the thoroughness of the investigations, stating that WWE did not question him despite him allegedly being one of the claimed victims.&lt;ref name=complexsports/&gt; The allegations caused a negative reaction on [[social media]] in March 2015, with the #FireDeMott hashtag trending on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=devlin/&gt; On March 6, 2015, DeMott publicly denied the allegations on  Twitter, but also announced his resignation from WWE "to avoid any embarrassment or damage" to the company.&lt;ref name=NXTresign/&gt;

==Other media==
DeMott voiced himself in the video game ''[[WWE 2K15]]''. He worked as a guide of sorts during the MyCareer mode.

==Personal life==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12829">'''Cat Herders''' is an award-winning commercial made by [[Fallon Worldwide|Fallon]] for [[Electronic Data Systems]] (EDS). Alluding to the [[corporate jargon|management-speak]] idiom "It's like herding cats" that refers to the impossibility of controlling the uncontrollable, it posits an analogy between herding cats and the solution of seemingly impossible problems by EDS.

Using a "giant Western metaphor", it features "grizzled cowboys"&lt;ref name="momentology"/&gt; herding thousands of cats across the [[Montana]] [[prairie]],&lt;ref name="Ebenkamp"/&gt; terminating in the satisfactory resolution "EDSolved".  The commercial was shown on 30 January 2000 at the [[Super Bowl]] XXXIV&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; and was cited by then-President [[Bill Clinton]] as his favorite commercial.&lt;ref name="momentology"&gt;[http://www.momentology.com/9611-most-memorable-super-bowl-ads-of-all-time/ James Fox on "EDS' Herding Cats" (2000) on  Momentology, "The Most Memorable Super Bowl Ads of All Time"].  Accessed 7 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title and Cat Herders campaign==
[[Electronic Data Systems|EDS]] retained Fallon in 1999 to create a campaign with strong brand awareness with a dual purpose: to change the company's image for present and future growth and also to improve the morale and self-image of its employees.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;    Fulfilling this remit, the advertisement "gave EDS employees an image that was serious, despite the humor of the commercial, and it highlighted EDS’s problem-solving capabilities for its customers."&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;

The title "Cat Herders" applied to both the initial advertisement and the campaign, which was presented as a trilogy.&lt;ref name="case"&gt;[http://marketing-case-studies.blogspot.co.uk/2008/09/cat-herders-campaign.html Marketing Case Studies blogspot, "Cat Herders Campaign", Wednesday, September 17, 2008].  Accessed 7 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  
The two sequels, "Airplane" and "Running with Squirrels", had visual impact but did not replicate the success of "Cat Herders".&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;

==Cast==
Authentic cowboys were required, and a casting call was put out across Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and California.&lt;ref name="Ebenkamp"/&gt;  Some of the cast had never acted previously but others were SAG-accredited.&lt;ref name="Ebenkamp"/&gt;

Actor [[Tony Becker]] points out that many of the actors were "real-life cowboys",&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;[http://hum90.com/tony_becker.htm#.Vwi6VqQrKM9 Tony Becker page on website for ''The Hunters'' (Human productions, 2009)].  Accessed 9 April 2016.   He states that details were supplied by Brenna Brelie, Global Communications Coordinator (from 2003-2007) at Fallon ad agency, who produced the commercial.&lt;/ref&gt; and gives a comprehensive cast list:

Notwithstanding the listing of only two participants as [[stunt performer]]s, many of the actors are skilled [[Stunt performer#Cowboy professionals|cowboy professionals]], with credits as [[horse trainer]]s, [[Wrangler (profession)|wranglers]], [[body double|doubles]], [[trick roping|trick-roper]] and also as stunt performers.   A few operate ranches or [[rodeo]] or stunt performing services, as per the citations given above.

For the shoot, some actors wore their own clothes, but their faces were made up to look cat-scratched, tanned or weatherbeaten.&lt;ref name="Ebenkamp"/&gt;

===Cats===
Numbers of cats used to create the illusion of thousands running wild vary from 50&lt;ref name="Ebenkamp"&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/creative-location-kitty-slickers-34612 Becky Ebenkamp, "Creative: On Location: Kitty Slickers", ''AdWeek'', January 17, 2000].  Accessed 9 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; to 60.&lt;ref name="Becker"/&gt;  According to Becker, "only about 60 cats were used in the actual filming (with about 1 trainer per 5 cats).  The rest were computer-generated".&lt;ref name="Becker"/&gt;

==Filming==

===Location and conditions===
Cat Herders was filmed during December 1999 at [[Tejon Ranch]], about 70 miles north of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Ebenkamp"/&gt;  Established in 1843,&lt;ref name="TejonRanch"/&gt; it is, at nearly 270,000 acres, the largest continuous expanse of private land in California.&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;[http://www.tejonconservancy.org/index_htm_files/Vol.%202_Appx%20A_final.pdf Knapp, J.J. and D.J. Knapp. 2010. Tejon Ranch Weed Management Strategy. Unpublished Report submitted to The Tejon Ranch Conservancy, Frazier Park, California. 62 pp.  Page 5].  Accessed 9 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;   The landscape features a "dramatic tapestry of rugged mountains, steep canyons, oak-covered rolling hills, and broad valleys"&lt;ref name="TejonRanch"&gt;[http://tejonranch.com/the-company/the-ranch/ Tejon Ranch website, Ranch page].  Accessed 9 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and cowboys on horseback still herd cattle along the open grazing land.&lt;ref name="TejonRanch"/&gt;

Filming was accomplished over five days of wintry conditions, workers in goggles and full face masks battling through rain, snow, fog, sleet, blowing sand and fierce 40[[miles per hour|mph]] winds.&lt;ref name="Ebenkamp"/&gt;  As one worker recalls:  "Shooting this spot was the most cold and miserable shooting days I've ever had.  Out in the plains, freezing cold, wind so strong it would catch your car door and bend it back."&lt;ref name="friends"&gt;[https://www.friendsinfilm.com/working-on-set-for-cat-herders-commercial-my-favorite/ Friends in Film website, page write by an unidentified author who worked on the film].  Accessed 15 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;   On set, the cats were housed in individual cages in "trucks filled with movie cats".&lt;ref name="friends"/&gt;  At night, "interspecies bonding" occurred with crew members bringing cats back to their hotels:&lt;ref name="Ebenkamp"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"we actually snuck a cat into our motel room because he had had surgery and needed to recuperate.  So he lived under the bed".&lt;ref name="friends"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Script===
The copywriter was [[Greg Hahn]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/author/4345/Greg-Hahn Campaign website bio for Greg Hahn].  Accessed 11 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; but "the script came largely out of the improvised quips of the cowboys, replacing cattle with cats".&lt;ref name="Macleod"&gt;[http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2005/cat-herders-herding-cats/ Duncan Macleod, "EDS Cat Herders Herding Cats", The Inspiration Room, May 26, 2005].  Macleod supplies the agency and creative credits in this post.  For his revised details on Bob Wendt, see [http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2005/film-producer-bob-wendt/ Bob Wendt, Cat Herders Producer, July 31 2005].  Accessed 10 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cat training and filming===
The commercial called for differing feline skills, including running, water scenes, or staying motionless.&lt;ref name="Ebenkamp"/&gt; To prepare for filming, 50 cats and their trainers travelled to Tejon Ranch a week before the crew.&lt;ref name="Ebenkamp"/&gt;

For the dramatic river-crossing, Art Director Dean Hanson told ''Adweek'', &lt;blockquote&gt;Trainers taught the cats to swim by starting them out in one-quarter inch of water, then gradually building the pool to swimming depth. . . . Since we were shooting in nippy weather, our 'river' was actually a small pool warmed by a portable heater, like a little cat Jacuzzi.&lt;ref name="Ebenkamp"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cats worked in shifts to film the herding scenes, with head trainer Karin McElhatton hiding in tumbleweeds to issue verbal directions.&lt;ref name="Ebenkamp"/&gt;

The illusion of cats stampeding was achieved by using clickers normally associated with food.  During filming, clickers prompted the felines to run downhill, towards food which was out of shot.&lt;ref name="friends"/&gt;  At other times, cats were lured by "strategically smeared tuna".&lt;ref name="Ebenkamp"/&gt;
 
===Animal welfare===
Monitored by the [[American Humane Association]], horses and cats were filmed separately in order to prevent "accidental tramplings".&lt;ref name="Ebenkamp"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;For scenes where both are required, a computer-operated motion-control camera is used to film the same shot over and over with each animal. The horses, background and layers of kitties are filmed separately, and each will be stripped in during post-production to create the illusion of an elaborate cat drive.&lt;ref name="Ebenkamp"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Christian music industry''' is a small part of the larger [[music industry]], that focuses on traditional [[Gospel music]], [[Southern gospel]], [[contemporary Christian music]], and [[alternative Christian music]]. It is sometimes called the '''gospel music industry''', although this designation is not a limitation on the musical styles represented.

Christian artists generally use secular styles, pairing them with lyrics that display faith and spirituality to varying degrees. Generally speaking, the industry is influenced by mainstream culture. Musical trends, for instance, follow those of the secular scene, though usually a few years behind.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_dct"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|loc="dc Talk" p. 239.}} '''Quote:''' "Of ''course'' the Christian market was a few years behind the rest of the world... it always is." [original emphasis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCM_20_1_CS"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Urbanski |first=David |date=July 1997 |title=One Crazy Summer |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=24–32 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RPCinA"/&gt; The Christian music industry carries the distinction of being the only music subculture whose content is labeled by its lyrical dimension rather than its music.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Still, music within the industry is sold by its musical style rather than lyrical content.

Christian music's critics point to the divergent interests of commercialization and ministry, which have, according to some, [[wikt:polar opposite|polar opposite]] goals. Aspects of Christian music have long struggled to gain general acceptance, even within the Christian community. What some see as secularization and a lacking of direct theology, others see as artistic ministry. This opens up questions of the definition of "Christian music" that have lingered over the industry since its inception.

The Christian music industry experienced tremendous growth in the 1990s. Christian music sales grew to exceed those for classical, jazz, and new age music.&lt;ref name="GMA_OV_08"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmta.com/GMA_Industry_Overview_2008.pdf |title=GMA Industry Overview 2008 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Christian Music Trade Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the Christian music industry has experienced the same issues as the general market in recent years.

==History==
The contemporary Christian music industry has roots in the late 1960s and early 1970s [[Jesus movement]] and its [[Jesus music]] artists. The ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music'' points out three reasons that the Christian music industry developed as a parallel structure to the general music industry.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|loc="Introduction" pp. 9–13.}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the Jesus movement produced a large number of bands in a very short period, which the general market was unable and/or unwilling to absorb.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_intro"/&gt; This was in part due to a lack of appreciation for the ideology expressed by such artists.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_intro"/&gt; Finally, Jesus music artists tended toward mistrust of secular corporations.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_intro"/&gt; According to another critic, the industry in this period was defined by four characteristics: lack of audience acceptance for styles, inferior production, inefficient distribution, and lack of wide radio exposure.&lt;ref name="RPCinA"/&gt; [[Petra (band)|Petra]], for instance, struggled to find an audience for their hard rock sound, partially due to limited distribution to Christian bookstores.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"&gt;{{harvnb|Cusic|2002|loc=Part Four, pp. 279–386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even so, the 1970s saw established corporations become involved in the Christian music market. [[Word Records]], founded in 1951, was bought in 1976 by [[ABC Records|ABC]].&lt;ref name="Mount_Web"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mount |first=Daniel J. |title=A City on a Hilltop? The History of Contemporary Christian Music |year=2005 |url=http://www.danielmount.net/ccm.html |accessdate=2007-02-12 |page=50 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203163712/http://www.danielmount.net/ccm.html |archivedate=February 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other music industry giants also got involved, [[Columbia Records|CBS]] started a short-lived Christian label, Priority Records, and [[MCA Records|MCA]] also fielded a label, Songbird Records, for a time.

While the Jesus movement had ended by the 1980s, the Christian music industry was maturing and transforming into a multimillion-dollar enterprise. The early 1980s saw an increase Christian booksellers taking product, and an increase in sales followed, despite [[Domestic policy of the Reagan administration#"Reaganomics" and the economy|the recession]].&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt; As a percentage of gross sales, Christian music rose from 9% in 1976 to 23% in 1985.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt; By [[Age to Age|her 1982 release]] [[Amy Grant]] had saturated the Christian marketplace and made significant inroads into the general market.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt; [[Sandi Patti]] and [[Michael W. Smith]] also gained influence within Christian music, each playing significant roles in the development of the industry.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt;

Harder forms of Christian music, such as [[metal music|heavy metal]], also began to gain acceptance. This is largely credited to [[Stryper]], who had begun making inroads into the general market by 1985.&lt;ref name="Hale_93"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hale |first=Mark |title=Headbangers |year=1993 |publisher=Popular Culture, Ink. |location=[[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] |edition=First edition, second printing |isbn=1-56075-029-4 |chapter=2869 |page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, rock and [[Christian alternative rock|alternative]] acts faced a longer battle for acceptance than [[Contemporary Christian music|contemporary]] acts, as the form was opposed by prominent religious leaders such as [[Jimmy Swaggart]] and others on the [[Christian right]].&lt;ref name="CCM_28_5"&gt;{{cite journal |date=June 1985 |title=Christian Rock Wars: Evangelist [[Jimmy Swaggart]] Tells Why He Hates Today's Christian Rock |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=14–17 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DTT_CROCK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.av1611.org/articles.html#Crock |title=Articles / Christian Music |publisher=[[Dial-the-Truth Ministries]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in 1981 total gospel music industry revenues were approximately $180&amp;nbsp;million, only ten years later they would total $680&amp;nbsp;million, according to ''CCM Magazine''.&lt;ref name="CCM_14_6"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gascon |first=Ana |date=December 1991 |title=A Music Video Network That Needs To Be Zeen |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=14 |issue=6 |page=12 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to RIAA data, market share for sales of Christian music albums more than doubled between 1993 and 1997.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19970317"/&gt; In the 1990s the Christian music industry became the fastest growing segment of the music industry.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19970317"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gillespie |first=Natalie Nichols |title=Gospel Is Fastest-Growing Genre |journal=CCM Update |date=March 17, 1997|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to several factors, including consolidation of record labels, and independent Christian bookstores into chains.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt;

The Christian music industry began adopting SoundScan in 1995, although implementation was spotty even into the millennium. Even so, the adoption caused the visibility of Christian artists to increase significantly, and brought credibility to the industry as Christian albums became integrated into all [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]].&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CCMU_19990712"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brasher |first=Joan |title=Christian Music's Mid-Year Sales Jump 21 Percent |journal=CCM Update |date=July 12, 1999|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCMU_1995_Review"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Akins |first=Debra |title=The Year in Review: 1995 Broke New Ground for Christian Music |journal=CCM Update |year=1995|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, 90% of Christian music sales originated at Christian bookstores. By 1995, that number had dropped to 64%, with general retailers taking 21%, and the remainder accountable through other methods, such as direct mail.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt; At that same time, the industry was estimated to gross $750&amp;nbsp;million, with $381&amp;nbsp;million in album sales.&lt;ref name="Econ_1995-08-19"&gt;{{cite journal|title=God's Own Country|publisher=The Economist|volume=336|issue=7928|date=August 19, 1995|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, general market retailers, especially big box stores such as [[Best Buy]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], and [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster]] began carrying a wider selection of Christian music products.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19980126"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren |first=Lindy |title=CMTA Launches Dove Retail, Radio Campaign, Wal-Mart to expand Christian music sections |journal=CCM Update |date=January 26, 1998|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000 those stores had surpassed Christian retail in terms of the number of Christian albums sold, according to [[Soundscan]] numbers.&lt;ref name="CCMU_20020107"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Connor |first=Lizza |title=Christian Music Sales Set Record for 2001: Gap between general-market and Christian retailers widest in SoundScan history |journal=CCM Update |date=January 7, 2002|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCMU_20011119"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren |first=Lindy |title=General-market Competition Focus for CBA Expo 2002 |journal=CCM Update |date=November 19, 2001|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon was partially responsible for crossover successes. [[P.O.D.]], for example, sold 1.4&amp;nbsp;million albums in 2001, although sales at Christian retail outlets accounted for only 10%.&lt;ref name="CCMU_20020107"/&gt;

The new millennium has brought [[2000s in music industry|challenges for the record industry]] as a whole, and these have affected the Christian music industry as well.&lt;ref name="CYTY_09_Recession"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Geil |first=Mark |title=Music in Recession |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |date=June 2, 2009|issn=0009-5753 |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/commentaries/2009/musicinrecession.html |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Contemporary worship music]], a long time staple of the industry, began to gain significant [[market share]] in about the year 2000.&lt;ref name="CR_46_8"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feinberg |first=Margaret |authorlink=Margaret Feinberg |title=Modern Worship Is Exploding |journal=Christian Retailing |date=April 15, 2000 |pages=45–56 |volume=46 |issue=8 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBAJ_32_7"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCabe |first=Ginny |title=Praise &amp; Worship Music Changing for the Millennium |journal=CBA Marketplace |date=July 1999 |volume=32 |issue=7 |page=222 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; By focusing on marketing worship music to youth culture, this genre became a growth driver despite the downturn in the general music industry.&lt;ref name="BB_111_18"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=May 1, 1999 |title=Worship Music Targets Youth |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |issn=0006-2510 |volume=111 |issue=18 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BB_118_13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB_115_07"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=February 15, 2003 |title=Praise and Worship Genre Blessed With Global Growth |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |issn=0006-2510 |volume=115 |issue=7 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCMU_20000529"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Riddle |first=Melissa |title=Modern Worship Music Booms: Labels scramble to meet demand |journal=CCM Update |date=May 29, 2000|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|quote="The money is just drying up.&lt;br /&gt;And it's not being replaced."|source=John W. Styll, president, [[Gospel Music Association]] and longtime ''[[CCM Magazine|CCM]]'' publisher&lt;ref name="CYTY_09_Recession"/&gt;|width=25%}}

Growth continued until about 2003,&lt;ref name="BB_118_13"&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 1, 2006 |title=Gospel and Christian |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |issn=0006-2510 |volume=118 |issue=13 |pages=35–37 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has generally followed the trends of the larger music industry since that point. In 2009 a [[The New York Times]] [[op-ed]] placed the entire music industry on a "deathwatch,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Charles M. |last=Blow |authorlink=Charles M. Blow |title=Swan Songs? |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2009-09-23 |page=A17 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/01/opinion/01blow.html |date=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that new forms of media, piracy, and new pricing options are driving gross sales down. In another example of parallelism, the Christian music industry has experienced largely the same phenomenon. In the Christian marketplace, music consumption has risen by as much as 30% since 2005, but overall album sales have dropped to about half of their 1999 levels.&lt;ref name="CYTY_09_Recession"/&gt; However, some critics point out that the current downturn may have long term positive effects for the industry. [[John J. Thompson]] told ''[[Christianity Today]]'' that "The lack of monetary benefit has filtered out some of the people who should not have been doing this in the first place. If the people who are in it for the money are gone, it leaves more turf for those who had something a little bit loftier in mind."&lt;ref name="CYTY_09_Recession"/&gt;

==Criticisms==&lt;!-- Obviously, there are a great number of bands that could be listed in this section. Please try to limit these to relevant examples. --&gt;

==="Ghetto" assertion===
Christian music is sometimes cited as a "ghetto,"&lt;ref name="RPCinA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AoR1999"/&gt; meaning that the majority of artists in the industry are pigeonholed to operate solely in it. These artists are isolated from the mainstream public, to [[Christian media]], including radio, magazines, and book stores. For many this is a conscious choice, however others, not content to stay in an isolated industry segment, attempt to "cross over" and gain acceptance in the general market. For many artists, being called Christian becomes a [[wiktionary:stigma|stigma]].&lt;ref name="Hendershot2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendershot|2004|loc=pp. 39–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|caption=A 1997 survey looked at familiarity with "well-known" Christian artists. Self-identified Christian music listeners in are shown in green, and the general public in red.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19970526_s"/&gt;
}}

A 1997 study revealed that a self-identified audience of "Christian music listeners" had what was considered a lacking recognition of Christian artists.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19970526_s"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Consumer Survey Reveals Potential Markets for Christian Music |journal=CCM Update |date=May 26, 1997|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey was commissioned by the [[Christian Music Trade Association]] and [[Z Music Television]]. The study looked at several artists including [[Amy Grant]], [[BeBe Winans|BeBe]] and [[CeCe Winans]], [[Carman (singer)|Carman]], [[Steven Curtis Chapman]], [[dc Talk]], [[Sandi Patty]], and [[Michael W. Smith]]. At the time of the survey, each of these artists was active in Christian music and had been so for at least nine years, was a multiple [[Dove Award]] and/or [[Grammy Award]] winner, and had albums [[RIAA certification|certified]] Gold or higher.

Even so, the survey found that the Christian music audience was no more familiar with artists in the field than they were with [[Hootie &amp; The Blowfish]], a popular act at that time. The study concluded that the word "Christian" was the problem, causing a stigma. "It's the label, not the music, that dissuades," one Christian music executive was quoted as saying, agreeing with the survey.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19970526_s"/&gt;

Another aspect of the "ghetto" is that some artists have trouble gaining audience with Christians due to their non-conservative image.&lt;ref name="Kyle_2006"&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2006|loc="If You Can't Beat 'em Join 'em" pp. 281–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stryper]] is a well-known example. Stryper received large amounts of criticism from groups on the Christian right, who argue (among other things) that their image as rock stars contradict their espoused faith. One critic wrote that the marriage of secular and religious elements in "Christian music" "violates all that God has commanded in the Bible about [[Doctrine of separation|separation]]."&lt;ref name="Truth85"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pyle |first=Hugh |title=The Truth About Rock Music |publisher=Sword of the Lord Publishers |location=[[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]] |year=1985 |isbn=0-87398-839-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "ghetto" has several effects, critics point out that the audience of such artists are often already Christians, thus limiting the impact of any supposed "evangelism."&lt;ref name="JoAC_15_3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.1992.t01-1-00079.x |last=Romanowski |first=William D. |title=Roll Over Beethoven, Tell Martin Luther The News: American Evangelicals and Rock Music |pages=79–82 |journal=Journal of American Culture |volume=15 |issue=3 |date=Fall 1992 |publisher=[[Bowling Green State University]] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is that artists sometimes have trouble appealing to and maintaining both secular and religious audiences. For example:

*One [[Jesus music]] artist, [[Randy Matthews]], ran into trouble at an early Christian music festival after announcing an upcoming tour with [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] and [[ZZ Top]].&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_RM"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|loc="Randy Matthews" pp. 566–569.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd, also reacting to his electric musical style, chased him off the stage, pronouncing him to be [[Demonic possession|demon]] or [[Drug abuse|drug]] possessed.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_RM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CCM_3_6"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rabey |first=Steve |date=December 1980 |title=Randy Matthews... The Long Road To Now |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=3 |issue=6 |page=14 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthews was later dropped from the tour.
*After [[Bob Dylan]] announced his conversion to Christianity in 1979, he released three albums widely cited as being based on his newfound faith.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_bdylan"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|loc="Bob Dylan" pp. 277 – 286.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan spent several years touring and preaching from stage, though he never became a part of the "Christian music subculture."&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_bdylan"/&gt; The result, as one critic bluntly puts it, was that "It didn't work. Christian music fans were characteristically suspicious of Dylan's failure to leave the world behind and become a part of their little ghetto, and the world at large tired quickly of paying money to hear him sing about religion."&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_bdylan"/&gt; By 1981, Dylan had dropped the explicit religious references; both critics and audiences returned his music to acclaim.
*While commonly cited as the father of Christian rock, [[Larry Norman]] struggled to gain acceptance from the Christian music industry, and was largely estranged from it for his career.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_LNorman"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|loc="Larry Norman" pp. 633–641.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CYTY_52_4"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Christian Rock's 'Father' Dies: icon Larry Norman was often estranged from the industry |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |date=April 2008 |volume=52 |issue=4 |page=13 |issn=0009-5753 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Upon This Rock (Larry Norman album)|1969 solo debut]] has been described by secular observers as "perhaps the first truly accomplished and relevant Christian rock testimony ever recorded,"&lt;ref name="AllMusic_LN_1969"&gt;{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r90988|pure_url=yes}} | publisher=Allmusic | accessdate=2009-04-26 |first=Vincent | last=Jeffries | title=''Upon This Rock''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1972's ''[[Only Visiting This Planet]]'' became one of the most revered albums of all time in Christian music. Even so, Norman became, according to ''CCM'' "so far outside the mainstream that most of today's Christian music fans have no idea who Larry Norman is."&lt;ref name="CCM_30_9_LN"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thompson |first=John J. |authorlink=John J. Thompson |date=April 2008 |title=Remembering Larry Norman |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=24 |issue=9 |page=42 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem, as summed by one critic, was that the music was too religious for secular audience, while simultaneously too aggressive for religious audiences.&lt;ref name="JMIA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AoR1999"/&gt; One critic describes the situation, stating that for a band "to be taken seriously outside the Christian scene, a band must stay far, far away from that scene."&lt;ref name="CTTY_06_06"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moll |first=Rob |title=Rock Un-Solid: When Christian bands bite the hands that praised them |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/june/28.62.html |date=June 2006 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mutemath]], for instance sued their record label with the goal of removing their product from the Christian market. [[Reset (Mute Math EP)|Their first release]] sold almost 30,000 copies, with "bulk of sales coming from the Christian market," according to ''Billboard''.&lt;ref name="BB_118_10"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martens |first=Todd |title=A question of faith: buzz band Mutemath, preferring secular rock, sues Warner |journal=[[Billboard Magazine]] |date=March 11, 2006 |volume=118 |issue=11 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band had been placed in the Christian market by their record label largely because their lead singer, [[Paul Meany]], was previously with the band [[Earthsuit]], whose [[Kaleidoscope Superior|only major label release]] was released on [[Sparrow Records|a Christian label]].

This caused the band to not get taken seriously by music critics, and by the release of [[Mutemath (album)|their full-length album]] the band began expressing discontent with their situation.&lt;ref name="TW_Mutemath"&gt;{{cite news |last=Holub |first=Annie |url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/church-and-state/Content?oid=1083036 |title=Church and State: Mutemath fights the machine at Warner Bros |work=[[Tucson Weekly]] |date=January 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meany told ''Tucson Weekly'' "...we began to see ourselves getting pigeonholed into this particular world that we weren't necessarily proud to be associated with... We're not trying to preach through our music; we don't have some kind of [[evangelistic]] agenda with what we're doing... You know, you don't want to be ashamed of your faith and your beliefs, but you don't want to be marketed by that, either."&lt;ref name="TW_Mutemath"/&gt;

On the other hand, some artists operate solely within the "ghetto" of Christian music, and find great success in doing so.

===Downplayed religious content===&lt;!-- Obviously, there are a great number of bands that could be listed in this section. Please try to limit these to relevant examples. --&gt;
An early Christian record label, [[Lamb &amp; Lion Records]] (founded by [[Pat Boone]]) reported in 1978 that it was their goal to produce crossover artists, but they were limited by lack of distribution to the secular marketplace.&lt;ref name="ET_29_5"&gt;{{cite journal |title=H-E-R-E-S'S Christian Show Biz! |last=Hortegas |first=Steve |journal=Eternity |volume=29 |issue=5 |date=May 1978 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both problems affected Christian labels into the 1990s.&lt;ref name="JoAC_15_3"/&gt; "Since people don't understand [the term] '[[Blood of Christ|the Blood of Jesus]], '" stated a manager for Lamb &amp; Lion, "...music that communicates must approach it another way. We've got to present a subtle but sensitive Christian message."&lt;ref name="ET_29_5"/&gt; Lyrics with subdued religious content have become commonplace in the industry; One critic points out that the secular hit "[[Spirit in the Sky]]" "has more explicit religious references than do many recent Christian radio hits."&lt;ref name="BILLBOARD_G_HIST"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alfonso|2002|loc="Contemporary Christian music: A History" pp. 11–29.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics have alleged that CCM often uses "minimal direct theology," and promotes a "Jesus is my boyfriend" image of God.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt; Using downplayed religious content in lyrics has allowed some artists to "cross over" and make significant impact into the general market. Some Christian bands are able to do this while maintaining their identity in the Christian market. For example, [[MercyMe]], whose double platinum album ''[[Almost There (MercyMe album)|Almost There]]'' produced the Christian and secular chart hit "[[I Can Only Imagine (MercyMe song)|I Can Only Imagine]]." However, the lyrics of the single, while Christian in nature, contain what one critic calls "rather [[wiktionary:vacuous|vacuous]] theology."&lt;ref name="JMIA"/&gt;

Sometimes "crossing over" creates ambiguity over whether an artist is Christian (a "Christian band"),&lt;ref name="AoR1999"/&gt; or the artist is composed of Christians and produces music that appeals to Christian music fans but doesn't cater to the Christian market ("Christians in a band").&lt;ref name="AoR1999"/&gt; Such artists are:

*[[Chevelle (band)|Chevelle]], whose [[Point No. 1|debut album]] was released to Christian music markets, received three [[Dove award]]s.&lt;ref name="DOVE_CHV1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?cid=32 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020106001828/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?cid=32 |archivedate=January 6, 2002 |title=Dove Award Recipients for Hard Music Recorded Song |publisher=[[Gospel Music Association]] |accessdate=2006-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DOVE_CHV2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020406020434/http://doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=2000 |archivedate=April 6, 2002 |title=Dove Award Recipients for Hard Music Album |publisher=Gospel Music Association |accessdate=2006-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the band is not generally considered to be a "Christian band" today. On that topic the band states "We originally signed with [[Squint Entertainment|a record company]] that was backed by [[Word Records|Word]] (a Christian label housing [[John Tesh]] and [[Amy Grant]]), so the record was in Christian bookstores. It was really an accidental thing."
*[[Project 86]] has sometimes been labeled a "Christian band", although the band itself eschewed the label. The band considers its art to be the best conveyance of their message.&lt;ref name="CM_Vol_52"&gt;{{cite book |last=Winters |first=Kelly |editor=Pilchak, Angela M. |title=Contemporary Musicians |series=Volume 52 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Gale Group]] |location=[[Farmington Hills, Michigan]] |issn=1044-2197 |isbn=0-7876-8065-6 |chapter=Project 86 |pages=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frontman Andrew Schwab has offered several statements on the topic. "We're not going to go in there and say 'Hey we're the Christian band. We're going to carry ourselves like a normal band. Hopefully people will like our music and investigate into the band [...] and they will learn our beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Wide range of music inspires Project 86 | author = Gonzales, Ron | publisher = [[Albuquerque Journal]] | page = 2D | date = May 28, 2004 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If we're playing at [[Ozzfest]] or on [[Family Values Tour|Family Values]]...," the band told ''[[7ball]]'' after the release of [[Drawing Black Lines|their second album]], "there is a greater level of tact necessary in order to reach that sort of audience."&lt;ref name="7b_30"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dodd |first=Jason |title=Hard and Fast |pages=51–52 |date=May–June 2000 |issue=30 |journal=[[7ball]] |issn=1082-3980 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 interview, Schwab further opined "We always tell people that the goal has been to just write music that we love, and write music hopefully that is challenging and inspiring to people and doesn't sound like everything else out there."&lt;ref name = "DIBASE_2007-04-23"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/interviews/Project862007.asp | title = I want ''Rival Factions'' | last = DiBase | first = John | publisher = Jesus Freak Hideout | date = April 23, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Switchfoot]] is often referred to as a "Christian band", mostly due to their involvement with the Christian rock scene in their early days. But the band has always shunned this label: "For us, it's a faith, not a genre,..." says Jon Foreman. "...these songs are for everyone. Calling us 'Christian rock' tends to be a box that closes some people out and excludes them. And that's not what we're trying to do. Music has always opened my mind—and that's what we want".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2004/01/09/switchfoot_steps_toward_stardom |title=Switchfoot steps toward stardom |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=January 9, 2004 |accessdate=2006-08-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050123135046/http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2004/01/09/switchfoot_steps_toward_stardom?mode=PF |archivedate = January 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duly, Foreman's lyrics steer clear of preachiness, exclusive declarations of faith, or even any mention of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], instead [[Social commentary|questioning the status quo]], probing [[Existentialism|existential]] issues through "[[Socratic dialogue]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utahstatesman.com/media/storage/paper243/news/2004/10/13/Features/Question.And.Answer.With.Switchfoots.Jon.Foreman-751862.shtml |title=Question and Answer with Switchfoot's Jon Foreman |date=October 13, 2004 |accessdate=2006-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130208220210/http://www.utahstatesman.com/media/storage/paper243/news/2004/10/13/Features/Question.And.Answer.With.Switchfoots.Jon.Foreman-751862.shtml |archivedate=February 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he answers questions with more questions, exploring frustrations, or simply being inspirational. Even so, this position has not alienated their Christian fans. As in their [[Indie (music)|indie]] days, they are still distributed to Christian retail outlets through [[Sparrow Records]], featured on Christian radio and charts, and presented [[GMA Music Awards|Dove Awards]], even after having been signed to the mainstream [[Columbia Records]]. [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] writer Andrew Beaujon takes the view that "their lyrics often have two different meanings, one meaning for a Christian audience and one meaning for the rest of us. They try to relate to two different groups of people at once".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=444350 |title=Rocking for Jesus |date=June 30, 2006 |accessdate=2006-08-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060706140202/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=444350 |archivedate = July 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In video====
The trend continues when examining religious videos. Many Christian bands produce videos with rotation on [[MTV]] in mind, however, the images can lead to an ambiguous impression of the portrayal.

In 1982 MTV featured two videos, "Constantly Changing" and "It's Mad" (which was the first one to be featured), made by the Swedish Christian rock band [[Jerusalem (Swedish band)|Jerusalem]] to promote their 1981 release ''Warrior''.&lt;ref name="MuLe_2_9"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Cable Music First? Lamb &amp; Lion act to be seen and heard on MTV. |pages=43 |journal=Billboard |date=November 20, 1982 |volume=88 |issue=? |publisher=[[Billboard Magazine]] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DeGarmo and Key]] was the first Christian band in the US whose video appeared on MTV, made a video for their single "Six, Six, Six" off their 1984 release ''Communication''. While the video was shown on MTV for a short time, it was subsequently pulled for a scene which depicted the [[Antichrist]] engulfed in flames, which MTV described as "senseless violence."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal |title=MTV Rejects DeGarmo and Key Video, Cites 'Violent' Scene |pages=3, 15 |journal=MusicLine |date=February 1985 |volume=2 |issue=9 |issn=0746-7656 |publisher=[[CCM Communications]] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the video was re-edited for MTV—however, the unedited version continued to play in Christian bookstores and on Christian television networks, like [[Trinity Broadcasting Network|Trinity Broadcasting]].&lt;ref name="MuLe_3_1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=DeGarmo and Key Video Airs on MTV |page=3 |journal=MusicLine |date=May 1985 |volume=3 |issue=1 |issn=0746-7656 |publisher=[[CCM Communications]] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video received a [[Dove award]] in a category created specially for it, "Gospel Music Visual Song" in 1985.&lt;ref name="MuLe_3_1"/&gt;

Another artist, [[Brian Welch]], whose ''[[Save Me from Myself (album)|solo debut]]'' was released to Christian markets, found their album pulled from some Christian bookstores after the music video for "Flush" was released.&lt;ref name="BrianW"/&gt; The video is an interpretation of the authors personal experience with [[methamphetamine]], before his religious conversion. At the time the album was pulled, Brian Welsh released a statement about the visual content of the video, relating its symbolism to his personal experiences of addiction and redemption. He also issued the following statement: "The video for 'Flush' is about [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]] addiction and the crazy things anyone addicted to meth will do while they're [[Substance intoxication|high]] or to get their fix. Everything the models were doing in the video is what I was wrapped up in while I was addicted to meth... I believe I would be dead right now if I continued using meth, but instead, I chose to [[Salvation#Christianity|surrender my life]] to Christ and die to myself so He could share His resurrection with me... There is a huge message of hope on my CD and I believe those retailers that are pulling the CD from their shelves are robbing someone spiritually by taking it off of the shelves."&lt;ref name="BrianW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-Korn guitarist Brian "Head" Welch defends 'controversial' video|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=105600|date=September 25, 2008|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Z Music Television - Joe Gow Study.svg|150px|right|thumb|Classification of videos on Z Music by content&lt;ref name="PMS_S99"/&gt;]]
A study of visual elements of Christian music videos on [[Z Music Television]], a now defunct MTV-like channel for Christian music, found that almost one third of the channel's videos could be described as "Ambiguously Religious" at best (red area, right).&lt;ref name="PMS_S99"/&gt; The conclusion was that the channel's programming was designed to make its Christian nature "apparent only to those willing to listen for it."&lt;ref name="PMS_S99"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gow |first=Joe |date=Summer 1999 |title=Rockin', Rappin', and Religion: Programming Strategy on Z Music Television |journal=Popular Music and Society |publisher=[[Bowling Green State University]] Popular Press |issn=0300-7766 |volume=23 |issue=2 |page=17 |ref=harv |doi=10.1080/03007769908591730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other arguments===
Some critics describe the Christian music industry as being committed "to the goals and strategies of the commercial marketplace – industrial growth, increased market share, and greater profits."&lt;ref name="RPCinA"&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|2000|loc="Evangelicals and Popular Music: The Contemporary Christian Music Industry" pp. 105–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s as the largest Christian record labels became subsidiaries of the "mainstream" labels (who are themselves owned by huge [[media conglomerate]]s like [[Viacom]] and [[Time Warner]]).&lt;ref name="AoR1999"&gt;{{Harvnb|Howard|1999|loc=p. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hendershot2002"/&gt; Others see the industry as taking on the roles traditionally reserved for the church. Concerts are the equivalent of religious services, and commodities symbols of faith.&lt;ref name="RPCinA_art"&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|2000|loc="Evangelicals and Popular Music: The Art World of Contemporary Christian Music" pp. 109–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under these conditions "[[evangelism]] becomes rhetoric—justifying the propaganda value of the industry's work – not spiritual reality."&lt;ref name="RPCinA_art"/&gt; One critic comments that "perhaps the 'ghettoization' and parallel institutionalism of CCM manifests itself nowhere more apparently than at numerous [[Christian rock festival]]s."&lt;ref name="JMIA"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nichols|2008|loc=Chapter 5: "Jesus on Vinyl" pp. 122 – 146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William James''' "'''Count'''" '''Basie''' (August 21, 1904&amp;nbsp;– April 26, 1984)&lt;ref name="NYT1984"/&gt; was an American [[jazz]] pianist, organist, bandleader, and composer. 

In 1935, Basie formed his own jazz orchestra, the [[Count Basie Orchestra]], and in 1936 took them to [[Chicago]] for a long engagement and their first recording. He led the group for almost 50 years, creating innovations like the use of two "split" tenor saxophones, emphasizing the rhythm section, riffing with a big band, using arrangers to broaden their sound, and others. Many musicians came to prominence under his direction, including the tenor saxophonists [[Lester Young]] and [[Herschel Evans]], the guitarist [[Freddie Green]], trumpeters [[Buck Clayton]] and [[Harry "Sweets" Edison]] and singers [[Jimmy Rushing]], [[Helen Humes]], [[Thelma Carpenter]], and [[Joe Williams (jazz singer)|Joe Williams]].

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
William Basie was born to Harvey Lee  and Lillian Basie in [[Red Bank, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Basie Centennial Ball&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Basie| first=Count |year=2000 |title=Good Morning Blues: The Autobiography of Count Basie | publisher=Paladin Grafton Books | isbn = 0-586-08638-2 | page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father worked as a coachman and caretaker for a wealthy judge. After automobiles replaced horses, his father became a groundskeeper and handyman for several wealthy families in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie (1985), ''Good Morning Blues'', p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Both of his parents had some type of musical background. His father played the [[mellophone]], and his mother played the piano; in fact, she gave Basie his first piano lessons. She took in laundry and baked cakes for sale for a living. She paid 25 cents a lesson for piano instruction for him.&lt;ref name="Count Basie, 1985, p. 33"&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie and his Friends, myspace.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Not much of a student in school, Basie dreamed of a traveling life, inspired by touring carnivals which came to town. He finished junior high school&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 2001, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; but spent much of his time at the Palace Theater in Red Bank, where doing occasional chores gained him free admission to performances. He quickly learned to improvise music appropriate to the acts and the [[silent movie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Though a natural at the piano, Basie preferred drums. Discouraged by the obvious talents of [[Sonny Greer]], who also lived in Red Bank and became [[Duke Ellington]]'s drummer in 1919, Basie at age 15 switched to piano exclusively.&lt;ref name="Count Basie, 1985, p. 33"/&gt; Greer and Basie played together in venues until Greer set out on his professional career. By then, Basie was playing with pick-up groups for dances, resorts, and amateur shows, including Harry Richardson's "Kings of Syncopation".&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 33–34, plate 3&lt;/ref&gt; When not playing a gig, he hung out at the local pool hall with other musicians, where he picked up on upcoming play dates and gossip. He got some jobs in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey|Asbury Park]] at the [[Jersey Shore]], and played at the Hong Kong Inn until a better player took his place.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Around 1920, Basie went to [[Harlem]], a hotbed of jazz, where he lived down the block from the [[The Harlem Alhambra|Alhambra Theater]]. Early after his arrival, he bumped into Sonny Greer, who was by then the drummer for the Washingtonians, [[Duke Ellington]]'s early band.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, Basie met many of the Harlem musicians who were "making the scene," including [[Willie "the Lion" Smith]] and [[James P. Johnson]].

Basie toured in several acts between 1925 and 1927, including ''Katie Krippen and Her Kiddies'' as part of the ''Hippity Hop'' show; on the [[Benjamin Franklin Keith|Keith]], the [[Columbia Burlesque]], and the [[Theater Owners Bookers Association]] (T.O.B.A.) [[vaudeville]] circuits; and as a soloist and accompanist to [[blues]] singers Katie Krippen and Gonzelle White.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, J. Bradford. ''Count Basie.'' in Kernfeld, Barry. ed. ''The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, 2nd Edition, Vol. 1.'' London: MacMillan, 2002. p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; His touring took him to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[St. Louis]], [[New Orleans]], and Chicago. Throughout his tours, Basie met many jazz musicians, including [[Louis Armstrong]].&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Before he was 20 years old, he toured extensively on the Keith and TOBA vaudeville circuits as a solo pianist, accompanist, and music director for blues singers, dancers, and comedians. This provided an early training that was to prove significant in his later career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/jazz/biography/artist_id_basie_count.htm|title=JAZZ A film by Ken Burns – PBS|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Harlem in 1925, Basie gained his first steady job at Leroy's, a place known for its piano players and its "[[cutting contests]]." The place catered to "uptown celebrities," and typically the band winged every number without sheet music using "head arrangements."&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[Fats Waller]], who was playing organ at the [[Lincoln Theatre (Harlem)|Lincoln Theater]] accompanying silent movies, and Waller taught him how to play that instrument. (Basie later played organ at the Eblon Theater in Kansas City).&lt;ref name="NYT1984"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0821.html |last=Wilson | first= John S. |title= On This Day: Count Basie, 79, Band Leader And Master of Swing, Dead |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 27, 1984 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he did with Duke Ellington, Willie "the Lion" Smith helped Basie out during the lean times by arranging gigs at "house-rent parties," introducing him to other leading musicians, and teaching him some piano technique.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Basie was in [[Tulsa]] and heard [[Walter Page]] and his Famous [[Oklahoma City Blue Devils|Blue Devils]], one of the first [[big band]]s, which featured [[Jimmy Rushing]] on vocals.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, he was invited to join the band, which played mostly in Texas and [[Oklahoma]]. It was at this time that he began to be known as "Count" Basie (see [[Jazz royalty]]).&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kansas City years===
The following year, in 1929, Basie became the pianist with the [[Bennie Moten]] band based in Kansas City, inspired by Moten's ambition to raise his band to the level of Duke Ellington's or [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Where the [[Oklahoma City Blue Devils|Blue Devils]] were "snappier" and more "bluesy," the Moten band was more refined and respected, playing in the "[[Kansas City jazz|Kansas City stomp]]" style.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to playing piano, Basie was co-arranger with [[Eddie Durham]], who notated the music.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, plate 10&lt;/ref&gt;
Their "[[Moten Swing]]", which Basie claimed credit for,&lt;ref name="Basie2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Basie|first=Count|title=Good Morning Blues: The Autobiography of Count Basie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8osZnKqbRwQC&amp;pg=PA127|year=2002|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81107-4|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; was widely acclaimed and was an invaluable contribution to the development of swing music, and at one performance at the [[Pearl Theatre (Philadelphia)|Pearl Theatre]] in Philadelphia in December 1932, the theatre opened its door to allow anybody in who wanted to hear the band perform.&lt;ref name="Daniels2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Daniels|first=Douglas Henry|title=One O'clock Jump: The Unforgettable History of the Oklahoma City Blue Devils|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p3tmQ4w1uR8C&amp;pg=PA144|date=January 2006|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-7136-6|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
During a stay in Chicago, Basie recorded with the band. He occasionally played four-hand piano and dual pianos with Moten, who also conducted.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; The band improved with several personnel changes, including the addition of [[tenor saxophone|tenor saxophonist]] [[Ben Webster]].

When the band voted Moten out, Basie took over for several months, calling the group "Count Basie and his Cherry Blossoms."  When his own band folded, he rejoined Moten with a newly re-organized band.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Basie joined Bennie Moten's band, and played with them until Moten's death in 1935 from a failed tonsillectomy. When Moten died, the band tried to stay together but couldn't make a go of it. Basie then formed his own nine-piece band, Barons of Rhythm, with many former Moten members including Walter Page (bass), Freddie Green (guitar), Jo Jones (drums), Lester Young (tenor saxophone) and Jimmy Rushing (vocals).

The Barons of Rhythm were regulars at the Reno Club and often performed for a live radio broadcast. During a broadcast the announcer wanted to give Basie's name some style, so he called him "Count." Little did Basie know this touch of royalty would give him proper status and position him with the likes of Duke Ellington and Earl Hines.

Basie's new band which included many Moten alumni, with the important addition of tenor player [[Lester Young]]. They played at the Reno Club and sometimes were broadcast on local radio. Late one night with time to fill, the band started improvising. Basie liked the results and named the piece "[[One O'Clock Jump]]."&lt;ref&gt;Dance, 1980, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; According to Basie, "we hit it with the [[rhythm section]] and went into the [[riff]]s, and the riffs just stuck.  We set the thing up front in D-flat, and then we just went on playing in F." It became his signature tune.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Hammond and first recordings===
[[Image:CountBasieEthelWatersStageDoorCanteen.jpg|right|thumb|Basie and band, with vocalist [[Ethel Waters]], from the film ''[[Stage Door Canteen (film)|Stage Door Canteen]]'' (1943)]]
At the end of 1936, Basie and his band, now billed as "Count Basie and His Barons of Rhythm," moved from Kansas City to Chicago, where they honed their repertoire at a long engagement at the Grand Terrace Ballroom.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; Right from the start, Basie's band was noted for its rhythm section. Another Basie innovation was the use of two tenor saxophone players; at the time, most bands had just one. When Young complained of [[Herschel Evans]]' vibrato, Basie placed them on either side of the [[alto]] players, and soon had the tenor players engaged in "duels".  Many other bands later adapted the split tenor arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Dance, ''The World of Count Basie'', Da Capo, New York, 1980, {{ISBN|0-306-80245-7}}, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

In that city in October 1936, the band had a recording session which the producer [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] later described as "the only perfect, completely perfect recording session I've ever had anything to do with".&lt;ref&gt;1981 interview cited in "The Lester Young Story" (Properbox 16) p14–15&lt;/ref&gt; Hammond had heard Basie's band by radio and went to Kansas City to check them out.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; He invited them to record, in performances which were Lester Young's earliest recordings.  Those four sides were released on [[Vocalion Records]] under the band name of Jones-Smith Incorporated; the sides were "Shoe Shine Boy", "Evening", "Boogie Woogie", and "Lady Be Good".  After Vocalion became a subsidiary of [[Columbia Records]] in 1938, "Boogie Woogie" was released in 1941 as part of a four-record compilation album entitled ''[[Boogie Woogie (Columbia album C44)|Boogie Woogie]]'' (Columbia album C44).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Boogie-Woogie/release/1944476  |title=Various – Boogie Woogie |publisher=Discogs |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When he made the Vocalion recordings, Basie had already signed with [[Decca Records]], but did not have his first recording session with them until January 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, Basie's sound was characterized by a "jumping" beat and the contrapuntal accents of his own piano. His personnel around 1937 included: Lester Young and Herschel Evans (tenor sax), [[Freddie Green]] (guitar), [[Jo Jones]] (drums), [[Walter Page]] (bass), [[Earle Warren]] (alto sax), [[Buck Clayton]] and [[Harry Edison]] (trumpet), [[Benny Morton]] and [[Dickie Wells]] (trombone).&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Feather, ''The Encyclopedia of Jazz'', Bonanza Books, 1960, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; Lester Young, known as "Prez" by the band, came up with nicknames for all the other band members. He called Basie "Holy Man", "Holy Main", and just plain "Holy".&lt;ref&gt;Dance, 1980, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Basie favored [[blues]], and he would showcase some of the most notable blues singers of the era after he went to New York: [[Billie Holiday]], [[Jimmy Rushing]], [[Big Joe Turner]], [[Helen Humes]], and [[Joe Williams (jazz singer)|Joe Williams]]. He also hired arrangers who knew how to maximize the band's abilities, such as [[Eddie Durham]] and [[Jimmy Mundy]].

===New York City and the swing years===
When Basie took his orchestra to New York in 1937, they made the Woodside Hotel in Harlem their base (they often rehearsed in its basement).&lt;ref name=nicholson&gt;{{cite book |last=Nicholson |first=Stuart |date=2004 |title=Ella Fitzgerald: A Biography of the First Lady of Jazz, Updated Edition |url= |location=London |publisher=Routledge |pages=50–51 |isbn= 9781136788130 | oclc=884745086 |quote=Toward the end of 1937, Ella moved again, this time to the Woodside Hotel at 2424 Seventh Avenue at 142nd Street, to be close to Jo Jones, the drummer from the Count Basie band. The band had recently hit town and was playing the Roseland Ballroom, and most of its members were staying at the Woodside...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, they were booked at the [[Roseland Ballroom]] for the Christmas show. Basie recalled a review, which said something like, "We caught the great Count Basie band which is supposed to be so hot he was going to come in here and set the Roseland on fire.  Well, the Roseland is still standing".&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the reigning band of [[Fletcher Henderson]], Basie's band lacked polish and presentation.&lt;ref&gt;Dance, 1980, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

The producer John Hammond continued to advise and encourage the band, and they soon came up with some adjustments, including softer playing, more solos, and more standards.  They paced themselves to save their hottest numbers for later in the show, to give the audience a chance to warm up.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; His first official recordings for [[Decca Records|Decca]] followed, under contract to agent MCA, including "[[Pennies from Heaven (song)|Pennies from Heaven]]" and "[[Honeysuckle Rose (song)|Honeysuckle Rose]]".&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammond introduced Basie to [[Billie Holiday]], whom he invited to sing with the band. (Holiday did not record with Basie, as she had her own record contract and preferred working with small combos).&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; The band's first appearance at the Apollo Theater followed, with the vocalists Holiday and [[Jimmy Rushing]] getting the most attention.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Durham returned to help with arranging and composing, but for the most part, the orchestra worked out its numbers in rehearsal, with Basie guiding the proceedings.  There were often no musical notations made. Once the musicians found what they liked, they usually were able to repeat it using their "head arrangements" and collective memory.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, Basie played at the [[Savoy Ballroom|Savoy]], which was noted more for [[Lindy Hop|lindy-hopping]], while the Roseland was a place for [[fox-trot]]s and [[conga]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1938, the [[Savoy Ballroom|Savoy]] was the meeting ground for a "battle of the bands" with [[Chick Webb]]'s group. Basie had Holiday, and Webb countered with the singer [[Ella Fitzgerald]].  As ''[[Metronome magazine|Metronome]]'' magazine proclaimed, "Basie's Brilliant Band Conquers Chick's"; the article described the evening:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Throughout the fight, which never let down in its intensity during the whole fray, Chick took the aggressive, with the Count playing along easily and, on the whole, more musically scientifically. Undismayed by Chick's forceful drum beating, which sent the audience into shouts of encouragement and appreciation and casual beads of perspiration to drop from Chick's brow onto the brass cymbals, the Count maintained an attitude of poise and self-assurance. He constantly parried Chick's thundering haymakers with tantalizing runs and arpeggios which teased more and more force from his adversary.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The publicity over the big band battle, before and after, gave the Basie band a boost and wider recognition.  Soon after, [[Benny Goodman]] recorded their signature "[[One O'Clock Jump]]" with his band.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later, Holiday left for [[Artie Shaw]]'s band.  Hammond introduced [[Helen Humes]], whom Basie hired; she stayed with Basie for four years.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Eddie Durham]] left for [[Glenn Miller]]'s orchestra, he was replaced by [[Dicky Wells]].  Basie's 14-man band began playing at the [[Famous Door]], a mid-town nightspot with a [[CBS]] network feed and [[air conditioning]], which Hammond was said to have bought the club in return for their booking Basie steadily throughout the summer of 1938. Their fame took a huge leap.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 217–218&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to their play book, Basie received arrangements from [[Jimmy Mundy]] (who had also worked with Benny Goodman and [[Earl Hines]]), particularly for "Cherokee", "Easy Does It", and "Super Chief".&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Basie and his band made a major cross-country tour, including their first [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] dates. A few months later, Basie quit MCA and signed with the [[William Morris]] Agency, who got them better fees.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, 1940, Count Basie and his Orchestra opened a four-week engagement at [[Southland (jazz venue)|Southland]] in Boston, and they broadcast over the radio on 20 February.&lt;ref name="Vail2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vail|first=Ken|title=Count Basie: Swingin' the Blues, 1936-1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mWZjiRBQJBkC&amp;pg=PA36|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-4882-5|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the West Coast, in 1942 the band did a spot in ''Reveille With Beverly'', a musical film starring [[Ann Miller]], and a "Command Performance" for [[Armed Forces Radio]], with Hollywood stars [[Clark Gable]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Carmen Miranda]], [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]], and the singer [[Dinah Shore]].&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Other minor movie spots followed, including ''Choo Choo Swing'', ''Crazy House'', ''Top Man'', ''Stage Door Canteen'', and ''Hit Parade of 1943''.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; They also continued to record for OKeh Records and  Columbia Records.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; The war years caused a lot of members turn over, and the band worked many play dates with lower pay. Dance hall bookings were down sharply as [[swing music|swing]] began to fade, the effects of the [[1942–44 musicians' strike|musicians' strikes of 1942–44]] and 1948 began to be felt, and the public's taste grew for [[pop music|singers]].

Basie occasionally lost some key soloists. However, throughout the 1940s, he maintained a big band that possessed an infectious rhythmic beat, an enthusiastic team spirit, and a long list of inspired and talented jazz soloists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swingmusic.net/Count_Basie.html|title=THE BIOGRAPHY OF COUNT BASIE|first=Jeff|last=Parker|website=Swingmusic.net|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war and later years===
The big band era appeared to have ended after the war, and Basie disbanded the group. For a while, he performed in combos, sometimes stretched to an orchestra. In 1950, he headlined the [[Universal-International]] short film ''[["Sugar Chile" Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet]].'' He reformed his group as a 16-piece orchestra in 1952. Basie credits [[Billy Eckstine]], a top male vocalist of the time, for prompting his return to Big Band.  He said that  [[Norman Granz]] got them into the [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]] club and promoted the new band through recordings on the [[Mercury Records|Mercury]], [[Clef Records|Clef]], and [[Verve Records|Verve]] labels.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 289–290&lt;/ref&gt; The [[jukebox]] era had begun, and Basie shared the exposure along with early [[rock'n'roll]] and [[rhythm and blues]] artists. Basie's new band was more of an ensemble group, with fewer solo turns, and relying less on "head" and more on written arrangements.

Basie added touches of [[bebop]] "so long as it made sense", and he required that "it all had to have feeling". Basie's band was sharing Birdland with such bebop greats as [[Charlie Parker]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], and [[Miles Davis]]. Behind the occasional bebop solos, he always kept his strict rhythmic pulse, "so it doesn't matter what they do up front; the audience gets the beat".&lt;ref&gt;Dance, 1980, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Basie also added [[flute]] to some numbers, a novelty at the time that became widely copied.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 281, 304&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, his band was touring and recording again. The new band included: Paul Campbell, [[Tommy Turrentine]], [[Johnny Letman]], [[Idrees Sulieman]], and [[Joe Newman (trumpeter)|Joe Newman]] (trumpet); Jimmy Wilkins, [[Benny Powell]], [[Matthew Gee]] (trombone); [[Paul Quinichette]] and [[Floyd "Candy" Johnson]] (tenor sax); [[Marshal Royal]] and [[Ernie Wilkins]] (alto sax); and [[Charlie Fowlkes]] (baritone sax).&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine reported, "(Basie) has managed to assemble an ensemble that can thrill both the listener who remembers 1938 and the youngster who has never before heard a big band like this."&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, Basie sued the jazz venue [[Ball and Chain (restaurant)|Ball and Chain]] in Miami over outstanding fees, causing the closure of the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnTSqVu9Zr4C&amp;pg=PA59|title=Jade Visions: The Life and Music of Scott LaFaro|first=Helene|last=LaFaro-Fernandez|date=January 1, 2009|publisher=University of North Texas Press|accessdate=May 2, 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, the band made its first European tour. Jazz was especially appreciated in France, The Netherlands, and Germany in the 1950s; these countries were the stomping grounds for many [[expatriate]] American jazz stars who were either resurrecting their careers or sitting out the years of racial divide in the United States. [[Neal Hefti]] began to provide arrangements, notably "[[Lil Darlin']]". By the mid-1950s, Basie's band had become one of the preeminent backing big bands for some of the most prominent jazz vocalists of the time. They also toured with the "Birdland Stars of 1955", whose lineup included [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Erroll Garner]], [[Lester Young]], [[George Shearing]], and [[Stan Getz]].&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Basie released the live album ''[[Count Basie at Newport]]''.  "[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]" (arrangement by Wild Bill Davis) was a best-selling instrumental and the title song for the hit album.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; The Basie band made two tours in the British Isles and on the second, they put on a command performance for [[Queen Elizabeth II]], along with [[Judy Garland]], [[Vera Lynn]], and [[Mario Lanza]].&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; He was a guest on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]],'' a venue also opened to several other black entertainers. In 1959, Basie's band recorded a "greatest hits" double album ''The Count Basie Story'' ([[Frank Foster (musician)|Frank Foster]], arranger) and "Basie and Eckstine, Inc.": album featuring Billy Eckstine, [[Quincy Jones]] (as arranger) and the Count Basie Orchestra. It was released by Roulette Records, then later reissued by Capitol Records.

Later that year, Basie appeared on a television special with [[Fred Astaire]], featuring a dance solo to "[[Sweet Georgia Brown]]", followed in January 1961 by Basie performing at one of the five [[John F. Kennedy]] Inaugural Balls.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 335, 337&lt;/ref&gt; That summer, Basie and [[Duke Ellington]] combined forces for the recording ''First Time! The Count Meets the Duke'', each providing four numbers from their play books.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Countbasie.jpg|thumb|Count Basie (left) in concert (Cologne 1975)]]
During the balance of the 1960s, the band kept busy with tours, recordings, television appearances, festivals, [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] shows, and travel abroad, including cruises. Some time around 1964, Basie adopted his trademark yachting cap.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

Through steady changes in personnel, Basie led the band into the 1980s. Basie made a few more movie appearances, such as the [[Jerry Lewis]] film ''[[Cinderfella]]'' (1960) and the [[Mel Brooks]] movie ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974), playing a revised arrangement of "April in Paris".

During its heyday, ''[[The Gong Show]]'' (1976–80) used Basie's "[[Jumpin' at the Woodside]]" during some episodes, while an NBC stagehand named Eugene Patton would dance on stage; Patton became known as "Gene Gene, the Dancing Machine".

==Marriage, family and death==
Basie was a member of [[Omega Psi Phi]] Fraternity. On 21 July 1930, Basie married Vivian Lee Winn, in Kansas City, Missouri. They were divorced sometime before 1935. Some time in or before 1935, the now single Basie returned to New York City, renting a house at 111 West 138th Street, Manhattan, as evidenced by the 1940 census. He married Catherine Morgan on 13 July 1940 in the King County courthouse in Seattle, Washington. In 1942, they moved to Queens. The Basies bought a whites-only home in the new neighborhood of Addisleigh Park in 1946 on Adelaide Road and 175th Street, [[St. Albans, Queens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://prrac.org/newsletters/janfebmar2017.pdf | title=This Green and Pleasant Land | author=Greene, Bryan | newspaper=Poverty and Race | volume=26 | issue=1 | date=January–March 2017 |publisher=Poverty and Race Research Action Council | p=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 1983, Catherine Basie died of heart disease at the couple's home in Freeport, Grand Bahama Island. She was 67 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=mRkqCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=Catherine+Basie+april+1983+freeport&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wajTMKeFcZ&amp;sig=bO2VDIeIBm0eU5LbVC-2iHOQ3Mg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqwPvP-LPcAhWyCjQIHUIFC1EQ6AEIYzAP#v=onepage&amp;q=Catherine%20Basie%20april%201983%20freeport&amp;f=false ''Rhythm is my Beat'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Count Basie died of [[pancreatic cancer]] in [[Hollywood, Florida]] on April 26, 1984 at the age of 79.&lt;ref name="NYT1984"/&gt;

==Singers==
Basie hitched his star to some of the most famous vocalists of the 1950s and 1960s, which helped keep the Big Band sound alive and added greatly to his recording catalog. Jimmy Rushing sang with Basie in the late 1930s. Joe Williams toured with the band and was featured on the 1957 album ''[[One O'Clock Jump (album)|One O'Clock Jump]]'', and 1956's ''[[Count Basie Swings, Joe Williams Sings]]'', with "[[Every Day I Have the Blues|Every Day (I Have the Blues)]]" becoming a huge hit. With Billy Eckstine on the album ''[[Basie/Eckstine Incorporated]]'', in 1959. [[Ella Fitzgerald]] made some memorable recordings with Basie, including the 1963 album ''[[Ella and Basie!]]''. With the 'New Testament' Basie band in full swing, and arrangements written by a youthful [[Quincy Jones]], this album proved a swinging respite from her ''Songbook'' recordings and constant touring she did during this period. She even toured with the Basie Orchestra in the mid-1970s, and Fitzgerald and Basie also met on the 1979 albums ''[[A Classy Pair]]'', ''[[Digital III at Montreux]]'', and ''[[A Perfect Match (Ella Fitzgerald album)|A Perfect Match]]'', the last two also recorded live at Montreux.  In addition to [[Quincy Jones]], Basie was using arrangers such as [[Benny Carter]] ''(Kansas City Suite)'', [[Neal Hefti]] ''([[E=MC² (Count Basie album)|The Atomic Mr Basie]])'', and [[Sammy Nestico]] ''(Basie-Straight Ahead)''.

[[Frank Sinatra]] recorded for the first time with Basie on 1962's ''[[Sinatra-Basie]]'' and for a second studio album on 1964's ''[[It Might as Well Be Swing]]'', which was arranged by [[Quincy Jones]]. Jones also arranged and conducted 1966's live ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'' which featured Sinatra with Count Basie and his orchestra at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. In May 1970, Sinatra performed in London's [[Royal Festival Hall]] with the Basie orchestra, in a charity benefit for the [[NSPCC|National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]]. Sinatra later said of this concert "I have a funny feeling that those two nights could have been my finest hour, really. It went so well; it was so thrilling and exciting".&lt;ref name="CharlesPignon"&gt;Pignon, Charles (2004). ''The Sinatra Treasures,'' Virgin Books, {{ISBN|1-85227-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basie also recorded with [[Tony Bennett]] in the late 1950s. Their albums together included ''In Person'' and ''Strike Up the Band.'' Basie also toured with Bennett, including a date at [[Carnegie Hall]]. Other notable recordings were with [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Bing Crosby]], and [[Sarah Vaughan]]. One of Basie's biggest regrets was never recording with [[Louis Armstrong]], though they shared the same bill several times.&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 Basie and his Band recorded an album with [[Jackie Wilson]] titled ''"Manufacturers of Soul"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Jackie-Wilson-Count-Basie-Manufacturers-Of-Soul/master/371537 |title=Jackie Wilson &amp; Count Basie – Manufacturers Of Soul at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/jackie_wilson/manufacturers_of_soul/ |title=Manufacturers of Soul by Jackie Wilson : Reviews and Ratings |publisher=Rate Your Music |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Count Basie introduced several generations of listeners to the Big Band sound and left an influential catalog. Basie is remembered by many who worked for him as being considerate of musicians and their opinions, modest, relaxed, fun-loving, dryly witty, and always enthusiastic about his music.&lt;ref&gt;Dance, 1980, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, he wrote, "I think the band can really ''swing'' when it swings ''easy'', when it can just play along like you are cutting butter."&lt;ref&gt;Count Basie, 1985, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;

*In Red Bank, New Jersey, the [[Count Basie Theatre]], a property on Monmouth Street redeveloped for live performances, and Count Basie Field were named in his honor.

'''Crazy Water Aqua Fun Park''' was a [[water park]] in the [[Gaza Strip]], [[Palestinian territories]], that served the territory's small wealthy class.&lt;ref name=aptorch/&gt; The park opened in May 2010 and was burned down by masked men in September 2010, after being closed by the Palestinian [[Hamas]] de facto government for allowing men and women to mingle.&lt;ref name=aptorch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Habib/&gt; In July, one [[Australia]]n newspaper called it "the new sensation" among Gaza's "privileged."&lt;ref name=TheAge&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/world/seaside-in-gaza-the-dress-codes-almost-as-dangerous-as-the-surf-20100730-10zu5.html " Seaside in Gaza: the dress code's almost as dangerous as the surf]
July 31, 2010, The Age.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mohammed Al-Araj]], a former economics minister for the [[Hamas]] de facto government in the Gaza Strip, was one of the owners of the park.&lt;ref name=Mcintyre&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/as-the-israeli-blockade-eases-gaza-goes-shopping-2035432.html "As the Israeli blockade eases, Gaza goes shopping"], Donald Macintyre, 26 July 2010, ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters1&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2010/08/02/test/life-us-palestinians-hamas-investment.html?emc=eta1 "New Gaza Leisure Projects Focus on Fun Not Hardship"] August 2, 2010, Reuters, New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=xitorch/&gt; Two thousand families visited the Crazy Water Park during the first four days that it was open.&lt;ref name=Habib/&gt;

==Features==
The landscaped water park, west of [[Gaza City]],&lt;ref name=maantorch&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=315971 Gaza: Assailants set fire to water park], Ma'an News Agency 19-09-2010&lt;/ref&gt; featured 3 swimming pools, a canal 100 meters long, three [[water slide]]s, ponds with [[pedalo]]s, a restaurant, a cafe, and a quiet area shaded by a tent where adults could sit on carpets and listen to music.&lt;ref name=Habib&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/6/21/nation/6511226&amp;sec=nation]"People relax at newly opened theme park," Shahanaaz Habib, May 21, 2010, ''The [[Malaysia Star]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheAge/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters1/&gt; The atmosphere was secular, with popular secular tunes playing over the loudspeakers and women in international-style clothing.&lt;ref name=Reuters1/&gt; A lifting of the government ban on [[Women and smoking|women smoking in public]] made it legal for women to smoke the popular [[Hookah|nargila]]s at the Park's cafe.&lt;ref name=Koutsoukis&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/world/edict-lifted-for-female-smokers-20100728-10w2c.html "Edict lifted for female smokers"] Jason Koutsoukis, July 29, 2010, The Sunday Morning Herald.&lt;/ref&gt; The park was built with materials assembled from war-torn buildings as well as materials brought through the [[Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels]].&lt;ref name=Habib/&gt; Construction was completed in six months.&lt;ref name=Habib/&gt; Admission was 10 [[Israeli new shekel|shekels]], the equivalent of about [[United States dollar|$]]2.60 as of mid-2010, but using the water slide costs another 5 shekels, and going into the pool costs an extra 20 shekels.&lt;ref name=Habib/&gt;

The park cost $2 million to build.&lt;ref name=Reuters1/&gt; According to Ayman Barawi, the Park's financial manager, "This park is a form of escape. People need a chance to escape from the stress. We brought 'air' to the people."&lt;ref name=Habib/&gt; According to [[The Guardian]], the water park was part of an entertainment "circuit" for wealthy Palestinians in Gaza, which includes seaside cafes, browsing at the [[Gaza Mall]] and riding at the [[Faisal Equestrian Club]], adjacent to the Park.&lt;ref name=Sherwood&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/06/gaza-riding-club-faisal "Gaza's elite enjoy riding at Faisal,"] Harriet Sherwood, September 6, 2010, The Guardian.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Park had 106 employees, not counting about 80 vendors supplying services and goods such as food.&lt;ref name=Habib/&gt; Park employees earned the equivalent of between [[United States dollar|$]]250 and $300 a month, considered a good wage in Gaza, where over 80% of the population received welfare payments from the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]] and other international aid agencies.&lt;ref name=Habib/&gt;

===Financial backing===
According to the Israeli ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' newspaper, the Crazy Water Park is one of a number of seaside tourist resorts constructed in a $20 million building binge.&lt;ref name=Toameh&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=182943]" "Palestinians in Gaza invest $20m. in new resorts", Khaled Abu Toameh, ''Jerusalem Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Independent]]'', some sources regard the Crazy Water Park as one of a group of [[Hamas business ventures]] operating since the late 2000s.&lt;ref name=Mcintyre/&gt; According to the [[Reuters]], the resort was built by a "Hamas-linked charity,"&lt;ref name="Reuters1"/&gt; According to [[Egypt]]ian journalist [[Ashraf Abu Al-Houl]] writing in ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]'', the park was one among a rapidly growing group of Gaza leisure parks, including [[Zahrat al-Madain]], the [[Al-Bustan resort (Gaza)|Al-Bustan resort]] and the [[Bisan City tourist village (Gaza)|Bisan City tourist village]], so many of which were completed between his visit to Gaza in February 2010 and his return in July 2010 as to make Gaza "almost unrecognizable."&lt;ref name=Houl&gt;[http://www.memri.org/report/en/print4482.htm] translation by [[MEMRI]], July 28, 2010, Al Ahram,&lt;/ref&gt; He continued, "a sense of absolute prosperity prevails, as manifested by the grand resorts along and near Gaza's coast. Further, the sight of the merchandise and luxuries filling the Gaza shops amazed me. Merchandise is sold more cheaply than in Egypt, although most of it is from the Egyptian market, and there are added shipping costs and costs for smuggling it via the tunnels – so that it could be expected to be more expensive....  the siege was broken even before Israel's crime against the ships of the Freedom Flotilla in late May; everything already was coming into the Gaza Strip from Egypt. If this weren't the case, businessmen would not have been able to build so many resorts in under four months".&lt;ref name=Houl/&gt;

==Government sanctions==
In August 2010, Hamas authorities closed the water park for three days as a "warning" to the management against allowing men and women to mingle at parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=185598]" Report: Gaza water park closed due to gender-mixed parties," 22 August 2010, Jerusalem Post.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September 2010, Hamas authorities shut down the park again for 21 days, along with other resorts and a horse riding club.&lt;ref name=xitorch&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-09/19/c_13520023.htm Gunmen torch Gaza resort], 19-09-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Residents of Gaza criticized the government for not backing investment in housing instead of water parks.&lt;ref name=Reuters1/&gt; One man, interviewed while relaxing at the Water Park, told a reporter that "If the money put into Crazy Water had been used to construct 10 buildings, 100 families could have been housed by now".&lt;ref name=Reuters1/&gt;

==Arson==
On 19 September 2010, the water park was burned down by a group of about 40 masked individuals in a move that was seen by human rights groups as part of the increasing [[Islamization of Gaza]].&lt;ref name=hatorch/&gt; Ala al-Araj, one of the owners and a former Hamas government minister, said that at about 3 am the men tied up the guards, blindfolded them and beat them. They then set fire to an administrative building; the fire engulfed the park's three-story restaurant and cafeteria, causing extensive damage.

The identity of the arsonists was not immediately known, but al-Araj noted that "all tourism projects in Gaza are threatened by extremists who reject them" and held the Hamas administration responsible because it had closed the resort. Since seizing control of the Gaza Strip in 2007 after [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|a violent conflict]] with rival Palestinian group Fatah, Hamas had been closing down restaurants, coffee shops and hotels in the territory, claiming these places violate Islamic tradition.&lt;ref name=hatorch/&gt; During the same period, other extreme Islamist groups carried out numerous attacks on establishments perceived as un-Islamic, including coffee shops, beauty salons and even UN-run summer camps.&lt;ref name=afptorch/&gt;

A spokesman for the Hamas interior ministry said it had opened an investigation, and denied a connection between the attack and the closure.&lt;ref name=afptorch/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart'''''|ドラゴンクエストモンスターズ キャラバンハート|Doragon Kuesuto Monsutāzu Kyaraban Hāto}} (''Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart'') is the third game in the ''[[Dragon Quest Monsters]]'' series, released only in Japan by [[Enix]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]].&lt;ref name="rpg"&gt;{{cite web | author=Cortney Stone | year=2003 | title=Dragon Quest Monsters III: Caravan Heart Details Roll Out  | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q1-2003/032103a.html | work= | accessdate=October 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was simultaneously announced with ''[[Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King|Dragon Quest VIII]]'' in [[Famitsu]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Anoop Gantayat | year=2002 | title=Dragon Quest Goes GBA  | url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/378/378989p1.html | work= | accessdate=October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the other ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' titles, development of ''Caravan Heart'' was led by [[Yuji Horii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Cortney Stone | year=2002 | title=Enix Sheds Some Light on Upcoming Dragon Quest Title  | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2002/121602c.html | work= | accessdate=October 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the second ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' game to be released for the [[Game Boy Advance]] (after ''[[Torneko: The Last Hope|Torneko no Daibouken 2 Advance]]''). ''Caravan Heart'' features the character Prince Keifer from ''[[Dragon Warrior VII|Dragon Quest VII]]'', as the game acts as a [[prequel]] to the [[PlayStation]] game. This is also the last game released under the [[Enix]] name, since the [[Square Enix|merger between Square and Enix]] was finalized a few days later, on April 1, 2003.&lt;ref name="Famitsu"&gt;{{cite web | author=Wollenschlaeger, Alex | date=March 28, 2003 | title=Japandemonium - From Safety to Where | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/japan/aw032803.html | work=RPGFan.com | accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Dragon Quest Monsters battle.png|right|thumb|150px|Battle in the game.]]
The game makes huge changes to the series by removing the breeding system. Instead, when defeating monsters in ''Caravan Heart'', the player can occasionally gain "monster hearts" which can be used to merge into a monster for a new more powerful form. Humans also fight in the battles with the monsters in this installment. The human characters have access to 20 [[Character classes from the Dragon Quest series|character classes]], like hunter, bard, fighter, dancer, mage, and mapper.&lt;ref name="rpg" /&gt;
Other differences include a [[convoy|caravan]] that the player must travel around in, allowing them to add both monsters and humans to their party. The caravan can have up to twelve members in it at a time, and each wagon can only hold a certain amount of weight.

==Plot==
On Prince Keifer's tenth birthday, the prince was looking for a way to cause a little trouble and snuck out of Gran Estard Castle. This makes his father very angry, and when Keifer is finally caught, he hides in his room. While hiding in the closet, a masked figure that calls herself ''The Master of the Illusions, Magarugi'' appears and tells Keifer that if he finds the Orbs of [[Erdrick|Loto]], he will be given one wish. Keifer is pulled into the spirit's realm of Torland, the world of ''[[Dragon Warrior II|Dragon Quest II]]''. When he first arrives, he encounters a caravan with a weak leader, Luin. Luin is also searching for the Orbs to save his sick parents. After their first battle together, the Caravan asks Keifer to lead them. All together, they must travel the world in order to find the cure for Luin's sick parents and allow Keifer to return to Estard Island.&lt;ref name="DQShrine"&gt;{{cite web | author=Dustin Hubbard and Dwaine Bullock | year=2003 | title=Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart at DQ Shrine | url=http://www.dqshrine.com/dq/dqmch/| work= | accessdate=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Caravan Heart'' was a top-seller during the time of its release, with over 538,000 units sold within three months of its release and 593,000 units sold to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Wollenschlaeger, Alex | date=June 29, 2003 | title=Japandemonium - Escape From the Mooselodge | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/japan/aw062903.html | work=RPGamer.com | accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo GBA Japanese Ranking | url=http://www.japan-gamecharts.com/gba.php | work=Japan-GameCharts.com | accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was given a 35 out of 40 by ''[[Famitsu]]'' magazine, netting a Platinum Award from the publication.&lt;ref name="Famitsu"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9003">The '''female gaze''' is a feminist film theoretical term representing the gaze of the female viewer. It is a response to feminist film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]]'s term, "[[Male gaze|the male gaze]]", which represents not only the gaze of the male viewer but also the gaze of the male character and the male creator of the film.  In contemporary usage, the ''female gaze'' has been used to refer to the perspective a female filmmaker (screenwriter/director/producer) brings to a film that would be different from a male view of the subject.   

== History ==
Mulvey discusses aspects of voyeurism and fetishism in the Male Gaze in her article, "[[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]".  She draws from [[Alfred Hitchcock|Alfred Hitchcock's]] film, ''[[Rear Window]]'', applying terms from [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud's]] theories of psychoanalysis to discuss camera angle, narrative choice, and props in the movie while focusing on the concept of the male gaze. From what Jeffries, the protagonist in ''Rear Window'', looks at through his camera to the camera angles in his discussion with his girlfriend, the Male Gaze is accentuated by each move in Mulvey's article. Mulvey's article focused on the concept of "scopophilia", or a pleasure in gazing and placed women as spectacles to be objectified and viewed, unable to return a gaze and dismissing women in film as adequate representations of human beings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|title=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|journal=Screen|volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical implementation ==
The female gaze looks at three viewpoints.
# The individual filming
# The characters within the film
# The spectator 
These three viewpoints also concern Mulvey's male gaze but focuses, instead, on females. Viewpoints expanded alongside diversity in film genres. [[Woman's film]]s were a genre that focused on female leads, showing the female as a diegetic story-teller rather than that of a spectacle. Movies such as ''[[Rebecca]]'' and [[Stella Dallas (1925 film)|''Stella Dallas'']] are examples of such films in which the traditional narrative is told through the female protagonist. This genre of film has evolved into modern day "chick flicks" such as ''[[27 Dresses]]'' and ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]''. The films are meant to represent the desires of female protagonists and, therefore, are to represent the desires of the female movie-viewer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Zoe Dirse looks at the female gaze through the [[documentary film]] genre, analyzing aspects of pleasure and viewer identification. She analyzes the gaze at the points of production and reception. She notes that if the cinematographer is female and the subject is also female, the object of the film takes on a different role.  Dirse argues that by having a female cinematographer allows females to be viewed as they really are and not the voyeuristic spectacle that the male gaze makes them out to be. While filming in [[Cairo]], Dirse was in a crowd and observed being noticed by the males around her. At first they seemed curious, and Dirse wondered if it was because of her gender or the fact that she had a camera. It was not long before they began to push past her, and she felt a sense of danger that she felt other females in Cairo shared. This is depicted in her film, ''Shadow Maker''. She said that her gender allowed her to be an unobtrusive observer – unlike a man – when filming gypsies singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dirse|first=Zoe|title=Gender in Cinematography|journal=Journal of Research in Gender Studies|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paula Marantz Cohen]] discusses the female gaze in the [[chick flick]] genre, with specific attention to the attire women wear. Spectacle overrules plot in films such as ''[[The Awful Truth]]''. [[Irene Dunne|Irene Dunne's]] wardrobe is regarded as a central aspect of the film. The different dresses that Dunn wears are extravagant but not sexualized. While the clothing may be regarded as comical, they are also supportive to Dunn's independence and femininity. Cohen notes that in the film ''[[The Wedding Planner]]'', [[Jennifer Lopez]] is fully clothed throughout the entire film. The clothes, as in ''The Awful Truth'', are regarded as comical yet they catch the viewer's eye without sexualizing her. Cohen also analyzes the relationship between the female lead stars of these films and their male co-stars. She states that these films truly depict what women want, that they are accentualized in a positive manner and have a partner who amplifies this accentuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Paula Marantz|title=What Have Clothes Got to Do with It?: Romantic Comedy and the Female Gaze|journal=Southwest Review|volume=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary usage == 

Critics have focused attention on the presence of the female gaze in cinema and television, in works such as ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', ''[[I Love Dick (TV series)|I Love Dick]]'' and ''[[Fleabag]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blake|first1=Meredith|title=From 'The Handmaid's Tale' to 'I Love Dick,' the female gaze is thriving on television|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-female-gaze-television-20170505-htmlstory.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial [[lesbian]] drama film ''[[Blue Is the Warmest Colour]]'' received considerable critical comment for the dominance of the [[male gaze]] and lack of female gaze, with some reviewers calling it a "patriarchal gaze".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autostraddle.com/blue-is-the-warmest-color-the-male-gaze-reigns-supreme-203158/|title=Blue Is The Warmest Color: The Male Gaze Reigns Supreme|date=2013-11-06|work=Autostraddle|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/11/08/blue_is_the_warmest_color_gets_lesbian_sex_wrong_partner/|title=“Blue Is the Warmest Color” gets lesbian sex wrong|last=Juergen|first=Michelle|date=2013-11-08|website=Salon|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/10/feminists-debate-cannes-winner-blue-is-the-warmest-colors-patriarchal-gaze-195397/|title=Feminists Debate Cannes-Winner ‘Blue is the Warmest Color”s Patriarchal Gaze {{!}} IndieWire|last=Hanna|first=Anne Thompson,Beth|website=www.indiewire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/movies/the-trouble-with-blue-is-the-warmest-color.html|title=The Trouble With ‘Blue Is the Warmest Color’|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|date=2013-10-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the book upon which the film was based was among the harshest critics, saying, "It appears to me this was what was missing on the set: lesbians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/05/blue-is-the-warmest-color-author-julie-maroh-not-pleased-with-graphic-sex-in-film-calls-it-porn-97557/|title=‘Blue Is The Warmest Color’ Author Julie Maroh Not Pleased With Graphic Sex In Film, Calls It “Porn” {{!}} IndieWire|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|website=www.indiewire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmaker [[April Mullen]] has said, "Women have this vulnerability and connection to a depth of emotions that I can see and feel in certain moments of truth in the films we create. To me, the female gaze is transparency – the veil between audience and filmmaker is thin, and that allows people in more."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.afterellen.com/movies/511655-director-april-mullen-mouth-female-gaze|title=Director April Mullen on how “Below Her Mouth” is all about the female gaze - AfterEllen|date=2016-09-12|work=AfterEllen|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://girltalkhq.com/below-her-mouth-dir-april-mullen-talks-about-the-female-gaze-working-with-an-all-female-crew/|title='Below Her Mouth' Dir.

[[File:Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje title page.jpg|thumb|Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje, title page]]
[[Image:Hektorovic notes.gif|thumb|right|The score of two [[bugaršćica]]s recorded by Hektorović, "Kada mi se Radosave vojevoda" and "I kliče devojka", from the first edition of ''Ribanje'', Venice, 1568.]]
'''''Fishing and Fishermen's Talk''''' also translated as '''''Fishing and Fishermen's Conversations'''''&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.hr/books/about/Fishing_and_fishermen_s_conversations_by.html?id=RYpiAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;({{lang-hr|Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje}}) is the most important literary work of [[Croatia]]n Renaissance poet [[Petar Hektorović]], finished on January 14, 1556, and printed in 1568 in [[Venice]]. ''Ribanje'' is a pastoral and philosophic narrative poem in three parts in which Hektorović describes in a letter to his cousin, his three-day boat trip from [[Hvar]] to [[Brač]] and [[Šolta]], accompanied by a pair of Hvar fishermen, Paskoje Debelja and Nikola Zet.&lt;ref name="Croatia-aspects-art"/&gt;

As a literary piece ''Ribanje'' has been variously classified in Croatian literary history as an  [[epistle]], as a fishermen [[eclogue]] or epic poem, and at other times as a documentary [[Travel literature|travelogue]].&lt;ref name="yul"/&gt;

==Content and analysis==

According to its content ''Ribanje'' is the first piece of Croatian literature written in verse in which travel is not described allegorically, but as a real journey, describing the beauties of nature and homeland. It's a travelogue of a Renaissance man who enjoys nature and considers it to be a refuge for man's spirit where it can achieve complete relaxation and invigoration. ''Ribanje'' is  the first described tourist journey of a modern, Renaissance man in Croatian literature; it is a first piece of Croatian culture in which world is described by parameters of human's concrete, earthly needs. To sum it up, ''Ribanje'' is the first secular, mimetic, realistic travelogue of Croatian literature.

In the poem the narrator—the poet himself—describes his journey across [[Adriatic]] islands and recounts events that he and his co-travellers experienced along the path. The narrator, great aesthetist and sensitive to beauty, often describes the landscape the company sailed through, admiring the beauties of his homeland.

The descriptive accounts of ''Ribanje'' combine the narrative parts in which events of the journey are detailed, along with the fishermens' complaints, dialogues and conversations. The poet-narrator often cites the conversation of the fishermen, quoting the truth, as he sees it, of their wise sayings and intelligent conversations.

Hektorović meticulously recorded the songs sung by the fishermen along the way, making this one of the earliest examples in Croatian literature to include transcribed folk music within the text.&lt;ref name="Croatia-aspects-art"/&gt; There are two [[bugaršćica]]s and three short songs, toasts or honorific songs, sung alternatively by the fishermen. This makes ''Ribanje'' a work that makes an interesting and aesthetically valuable synthesis, a blending of artistic and folk literature.

==Translations==

The work has been translated from Croatian to English as ''Fishing and fishermen's conversation'' by Edward Dennis Goy in 1979. In 1999 [[Matica hrvatska]] published a facsimile reprint of the edition princeps of ''Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje'', with parallel translation to modern standard Croatian, conducted by [[Marko Grčić]].&lt;ref name="mh"/&gt; The only two extant copies of the first edition are held at the library of [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

==Movie adaptations==

Croatian film director [[Milan Trenc]] was awarded funds for the feature film adaptation of the work in the spring of 2017 by Croatian audiovisual center.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.havc.hr/img/newsletter/files/dugi%20igrani_obrazlozenje_final_15052017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The film is planned to go into production in 2018.

'''''Fukuwarai''''' ([[wikt:福|福]][[wikt:笑|笑]][[wikt:い|い]]), or in [[English language|English]], "Lucky Laugh", is a Japanese game played around the [[Japanese New Year|Lunar New Year]]. The game is usually played by children, but adults may play also. The game is similar to that of [[Pin the Tail on the Donkey]] except for being performed on a table. The players of Fukuwarai put parts of the face (such as the [[Human eye|eyes]], [[Eyebrow|eyebrows]], [[Human nose|nose]] and [[mouth]]) onto a blank face. Recently, there have been computer and online games created to simulate Fukuwarai.

They are often used in [[Romance novel|romantic stories]], where the hero is caught in a [[love triangle]] between two women and will usually choose the "girl next door" he grew up with, rather than a more well-off or beautiful woman with less morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/829154479|title=Ebert's bigger little movie glossary : a greatly expanded and much improved compendium of movie clichés, stereotypes, obligatory scenes, hackneyed formulas, shopworn conventions, and outdated archetypes|date=1999|publisher=Andrews McMeel|others=Ebert, Roger.|isbn=0740792466|location=Kansas City, Mo.|oclc=829154479}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other times, this character ignores the hero for another male character, despite being the object of his affections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987796701|title=Romancing the zombie : essays on the undead as significant "other"|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Szanter, Ashley,, Richards, Jessica K.,, Bishop, Kyle William, 1973-|year=|isbn=147666742X|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=45|oclc=987796701}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{bettersource|date=July 2018}}

'''Humor styles''' are a topic of research in the field of [[personality psychology]] related to the ways in which individuals differ in their use of [[humor]] in everyday life.  People of all ages and backgrounds engage in humor, but the way they use it can vary greatly. Although humor styles can vary slightly depending on the situation, they tend to be a relatively stable personality characteristic among individuals.  That is, individuals are fairly consistent in the ways they use humor over time.&lt;ref name=Willibald /&gt;

The Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ) has emerged as a robust model for understanding the individual differences in humor styles.  Humor can be used to enhance the [[self]] or enhance one's relationship with others.  Humor can be relatively benevolent or potentially detrimental (either to the self or others).&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;  The combination of these factors creates four distinct humor styles: affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating. Some styles of humor promote health and [[quality of life|well-being]], while other styles can be potentially detrimental to mental and physical health.&lt;ref name=Willibald&gt;{{cite book|last=Willibald|first=Ruch|title=Explorations of a Personality Characteristic|year=1998|publisher=DE GRUYTER MOUTON|isbn=9783110804607|pages=159–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ)==
The Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ) was developed by Rod Martin and Patricia Doris (2003) to measure individual differences in styles of humor.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;  Humor has been shown to be a personality characteristic that remains relatively stable over time.&lt;ref name=Willibald /&gt;  Humor is sometimes viewed as a one-dimensional trait.  However, individuals seem to differ in the ways in which they use humor in their everyday lives, and different styles of humor seem to have different outcomes.  The Humor Styles Questionnaire was developed to identify the ways in which individuals differ in humor styles and how these differences influence health, well-being, relationships, and other outcomes.&lt;ref name=HSQ /&gt;

The Humor Styles Questionnaire is a 32-item [[self-report study|self-report inventory]] used to identify how individuals use humor in their lives.  Participants respond to the degree to which they agree with each statement (e.g., "I enjoy making people laugh") on a scale from 1 (''totally disagree'') to 7 (''totally agree'').  The questionnaire measures two main factors in humor.  The first factor measures whether humor is used to enhance the self or enhance one's relationships with others.  The second factor measures whether the humor is relatively benevolent or potentially detrimental and destructive.  The combination of these factors creates four distinct humor styles: affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating.&lt;ref name=HSQ&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin |first=Rod |title=Humor Styles Questionnaire |url=http://www.hnu.edu/ishs/ISHS%20Test%20Bank/TestCat_HSQ.htm |accessdate=12 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416154913/http://www.hnu.edu/ishs/ISHS%20Test%20Bank/TestCat_HSQ.htm |archivedate=16 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affiliative humor===
'''Affiliative humor''' is defined as the style of humor used to enhance one's relationships with others in a benevolent, positive manner.  This style of humor is typically used in a benevolent, [[self-acceptance|self-accepting]] way. Individuals high in this dimension often use humor as a way to charm and amuse others, ease tension among others, and improve relationships.  They are often spontaneous in their joke telling, frequently participate in witty banter, and enjoy laughing with others. Affiliative humor is similar to self-defeating humor because both styles of humor enhance the relationships with others.  However, unlike self-defeating humor, affiliative humor is not used at one's own expense.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

A number of outcomes are associated with the use of affiliative humor. Individuals who report high levels of affiliative humor are more likely to initiate friendships.&lt;ref name=Yip&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yip|first=Jeremy|author2=Rod Martin|title=Sense of humor, emotional intelligence, and social competence|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|date=December 2006|volume=40|issue=6|pages=1202–1208|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656605000577|accessdate=6 April 2012|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2005.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an organizational setting, affiliative humor has been shown to increase group cohesiveness and promote creativity in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Workplace&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romero|first=Eric|author2=Kevin Cruthirds|title=The Use of Humor in the Workplace|journal=Academy of Management Perspectives|date=May 2006|volume=20|issue=2|pages=58–69|url=http://uv7gq6an4y.scholar.serialssolutions.com/?sid=google&amp;auinit=EJ&amp;aulast=Romero&amp;atitle=The+use+of+humor+in+the+workplace&amp;title=Academy+of+Management+perspectives&amp;volume=20&amp;issue=2&amp;date=2006&amp;spage=58&amp;issn=1558-9080|accessdate=13 April 2012|doi=10.5465/amp.2006.20591005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affiliative humor is also associated with increased levels of (explicit) [[self-esteem]], psychological well-being, [[Neuroticism|emotional stability]], and social intimacy. They are also more likely to exhibit higher levels of [[implicit self-esteem]] (independently of their level of explicit self-esteem).&lt;ref&gt;

This style of humor is associated with decreased levels of depressive symptoms&lt;ref name=Frewen /&gt; and anxiety.  Individuals who use affiliative humor tend to have higher levels of [[extraversion]] and [[openness to experience]] as personality characteristics.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

Examples of items targeting affiliative humor on the HSQ include:
* I don't often joke around with my friends.
* I rarely make other people laugh by telling funny stories about myself. (reversed)

===Self-enhancing humor===
'''Self-enhancing humor''' is a style of humor related to having a good-natured attitude toward life, having the ability to laugh at yourself, your circumstances and the idiosyncrasies of life in constructive, non-detrimental manner. It is used by individuals to enhance the self in a benevolent, positive manner.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;  This type of humor is best understood as a type of [[coping (psychology)|coping]] or [[emotion self-regulation|emotion-regulating]] humor in which individuals use humor to look on the bright side of a bad situation, find the silver lining or maintain a positive attitude even in trying times.&lt;ref name=Martin1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Rod|title=Humor, laughter, and physical health: Methodological issues and research findings|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=July 2001|volume=127|issue=4|pages=504–519|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.4.504}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 March 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-enhancing humor is associated with a number of personality variables as well as psychological, physical and health-related outcomes.  Individuals who engage more in the self-enhancing humor style are less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name=Frewen /&gt;  In an organizational setting, self-enhancing humor has been shown to promote creativity and reduce stress in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Workplace /&gt;  The self-enhancing style of humor has also been shown to be related to increased levels of self-esteem, [[optimism]], and psychological well-being, as well as decreased levels of depression and anxiety. Individuals who use the self-enhancing humor style are more likely to exhibit [[extraversion]] and [[openness to experience]] as personality characteristics and less likely to exhibit [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

Examples of self-enhancing humor on the HSQ include:
*If I am feeling upset or unhappy I usually try to think of something funny about the situation to make myself feel better.
*Even when I’m by myself, I’m often amused by the absurdities of life.

===Aggressive humor===
'''Aggressive humor''' is a style of humor that is potentially detrimental towards others.   This type of humor is characterized by the use of sarcasm, put-downs, teasing, criticism, ridicule, and other types of humor used at the expense of others. Aggressive humor often disregards the impact it might have on others.  Prejudices such as [[racism]] and [[sexism]] are considered to be the aggressive style of humor.  This type of humor may at times seem like playful fun, but sometimes the underlying intent is to harm or belittle others.  Aggressive humor is related to higher levels of [[neuroticism]] and lower levels of [[agreeableness]] and [[conscientiousness]].&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

Individuals who exhibit higher levels of aggressive humor tend to score higher on measures of hostility and general aggression.  Males tend to use aggressive humor more often than women.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

Examples of aggressive humor on the HSQ might include:
*When telling jokes or saying funny things, I am usually not very concerned about how other people are taking it.
*People are never offended or hurt by my sense of humor. (reversed)
*If you think people are laughing at you, they probably are.

===Self-defeating humor===
'''Self-defeating humor''' is the style of humor characterized by the use of potentially detrimental humor towards the self in order to gain approval from others.  Individuals high in this dimension engage in self-disparaging humor in which laughter is often at their own expense.  Self-defeating humor often comes in the form of pleasing others by being the "butt" of the joke. This style of humor is sometimes seen as a form of [[denial]] in which humor is used as a [[defense mechanism]] for hiding negative feelings about the self.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Rod|author2=Patricia Puhlik-Doris |author3=Gwen Larsen |author4=Jeanette Gray |author5=Kelly Weir |title=Individual differences in uses of humor and their relation to psychological well-being: Development of the Humor Styles Questionnaire|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|date=February 2003|volume=37|issue=1|pages=48–75|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656602005342#BIB31|accessdate=26 March 2012|doi=10.1016/S0092-6566(02)00534-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of variables are associated with self-defeating humor. Individuals who more frequently use self-defeating humor show increased depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name=Frewen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frewen|first=Paul|author2=Jaylene Brinker |author3=Rod Martin |author4=David Dozois |title=Humor styles and personality-vulnerability to depression|journal=Humor|year=2008|volume=21|series=2|pages=179–195|doi=10.1515/humor.2008.009}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 April 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who use this style of humor tend to have higher levels of [[neuroticism]] and lower levels of [[agreeableness]] and [[conscientiousness]].  Self-defeating humor is associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety and psychiatric symptoms.  It is also associated with lower levels of self-esteem, psychological well-being and intimacy.

Examples of self-defeating items on the Humor Styles Questionnaire might include:
*I often try to make people like or accept me more by saying something funny about my own weaknesses, blunders, or faults.
*If I am having problems or feeling unhappy, I often cover it up by joking around, so that even my closest friends don’t know how I really feel.

'''Kyoto City Zoo''' (京都市動物園) is a zoo located in [[Sakyō-ku, Kyoto|Sakyō]] ward, [[Kyoto]] and was established in 1903, making it the second oldest zoo in the country&lt;ref name="city_history"/&gt; after [[Ueno Zoo]] in Tokyo. 

The Kyoto City Zoo is a member of the [[world Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (WAZA).

==History==

;Early years

The Kyoto Municipal Zoo was opened to the public on 1 April 1903 with 238 animals representing 61 species. The total area of the zoo was {{Convert|3.4|ha|acre}}, and the zoo had 6,591 visitors on its first day of operation.&lt;ref name="zoo_history"/&gt;

A guide for the zoo was first published in 1905, and by its 10th birthday the zoo was home to 274 individuals representing 156 species.&lt;ref name="zoo_history"/&gt;

In 1923, the zoo opened the Elephant Room and was able to move its elephants from temporary to permanent quarters. In 1927, the Hippopotamus Room was opened.&lt;ref name="zoo_history"/&gt;

;World War II

By 1940, the population of the zoo numbered 965 individuals representing 209 species. During the Second World War, large carnivores were killed by military order, and other animals died from hunger, malnutrition, and cold. At the end of the war, only 274 individuals of 72 species remained at the zoo. The South part of the zoo was taken over by the occupation forces, which did not leave the zoo until 1952.&lt;ref name="zoo_history"/&gt;

;The 1950s-90s
The Giraffe Room was opened in 1953, along with a saltwater aquarium (the aquarium was removed in 1968). In 1954, the Sea Lion Pond was completed, and the zoo held its first "Summer School," attended by 180 students. "Fairyland" was opened in 1955, an amusement park that now includes a Ferris wheel, fun train, and dodgem cars in the shape of popular characters. The Ape Room was built in 1969, and the Reptile Room in 1974.&lt;ref name="zoo_history"/&gt;

The Red Panda Room was completed in 1980, and the dome aviary (Water Bird Pavilion) was completed in 1983. This aviary is {{Convert|21|m|ft}} in diameter and {{Convert|11|m|ft}} high in the center. Other exhibits completed in the 1980s include the Bird Room (1985), the Senow Room (1988), and the Kyotaro Room (1989 - now housing orangutans). 1989 saw the start of the wildlife rescue operation, though the Wildlife Rescue Center was not completed until 1990. The Beast Room was completed in 1993.&lt;ref name="zoo_history"/&gt;

;Recent history

In 2003, 100 years after its founding, the zoo was home to 721 individuals representing 175 species. The zoo completed the Monkey Room in 2004, and a new Ape Room, as well as a new East entrance, in 2009.&lt;ref name="zoo_history"/&gt;

In 2005, facilities have redesigned.&lt;ref name="sharingkyoto"/&gt;

==Animals==

Animals at the zoo include [[lion]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[jaguar]]s, [[bear]]s, [[hippopotamus|hippos]], [[giraffe]]s, [[zebra]]s, [[deer]], [[llama]]s, [[gorilla]]s, [[orangutan]]s, [[chimpanzee]]s, [[monkey]]s, [[Red panda]]s, [[tanuki]], [[fox]]es, [[ostrich]]es, [[Crane (bird)|crane]]s, [[swan]]s, [[duck]]s, [[flamingo]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[peacock]]s, [[Humboldt penguin]]s, and [[sea lion]]s.&lt;ref name="zoo_map"/&gt;

==Other facilities==

;Animal data room

The Animal Data Room includes skeletons and other information about former residents of the zoo. It was started in 1982 with information about red pandas, and tiger information was added in 2010 (year of the tiger).&lt;ref name="zoo_museum"/&gt;

;Children's zoo

A children's zoo opened in 1955, and lets visitors watch the animals from up close and even touch them. Animals in this area include [[rabbit]]s, [[Guinea Pig|Guinea pig]], [[miniature pig]]s, [[goat]]s, [[tortoise]]s, a [[donkey]], [[cockatoo]]s, [[chicken]]s, [[duck]]s, a [[Ural owl]], and [[rockhopper penguin]]s.&lt;ref name="zoo_childrens"/&gt;

==Wildlife rescue==

The zoo includes a wildlife rescue center opened in 1989 and operated in cooperation with Kyoto Prefecture and Kyoto City. The center rehabilitates injured wildlife for release by the prefecture. The rescue center is not open to the public.&lt;ref name="zoo_rescue"/&gt;

==Incidents and criticism==

In 1932, a lion had to be shot dead after having escaped from the zoo.&lt;ref name="zoo_history"/&gt;
In June 2008, a zookeeper was killed by a tiger while cleaning its cage.&lt;ref name="japantoday"/&gt;

In 2007, the animal welfare society "Animal Concerns Research and Education Society" conducted an investigation into the conditions of [[Polar bears]] at the 24 Japanese Zoos that keep them, and found all, including the Kyoto Zoo, to be in violation of Canadian standards for animal care. The publication of their findings listed Kyoto Municipal Zoo as one of the facilities in which they found concerns.&lt;ref name="polar_bears"/&gt;

'''Live TV Bingo''' was a British television [[game show]].

==Presenters==

TV Bingo has a team of regular presenters. They include Claire Anstey, Richie Litchfield, Stuart Stone, Paul Metcalfe, Syritta Spearring, Claira Hermet and many more with a different presenter every 30 minutes. The programme's mascot was a cuddly panda called Bingo B. Bear.

==Method of Play==

Chips are placed on the table by means of a [[telephone]] menu.

TV Bingo is a fixed odds betting game similar to the lottery or Keno.

You simply choose 6 numbers using your telephone by calling the number on screen during the show and follow the prompts. You can pick six numbers of your own or simply go for a "Lucky Dip" where the six numbers are randomly selected for you by the computer. Be sure to write these numbers down when you pick them.

The first time you call the number on screen you will be put through to our administration centre so you can register. Registration is a very simple process where you give across your name, address, etc., choose your on-screen player name and make your first deposit of a minimum of £10.

Once you have registered you can buy a TV Bingo ticket for anything from a minimum of £1 up to a maximum of £10. Once you have selected and confirmed your numbers you are in for the next draw. If you get in early enough you should also see your numbers and your player name appear on screen.

Every two minutes we "Get ready to Jumble" where the winnings numbers are revealed by our computer. After this a list of the winners will appear on screen, so keep watching once you've bought your ticket to see if you're a winner!

Below is a list of the possible payouts for the game to give some examples of what you can win.

Pay outs from a £1 ticket
1 no = £1
2 no's = £2 
3 no's = £20 
4 no's = £100 
5 no's = £1000 
6 no's = £10,000

Pay outs from a £10 Ticket
1 no = £10
2 no = £20
3 no = £100
4 no = £1000
5 no = £10,000
6 no = £100,000

==Age Restrictions==

One had to be 18 years or older to play TV Bingo.

==Winners on TV Bingo==

After each round, every winner from that game is displayed on screen, along with the amount of money won.

'''''Léolo''''' is a 1992 Canadian [[coming of age film|coming of age]]-[[fantasy film]] by director [[Jean-Claude Lauzon]]. The film tells the story of a young boy named Léo "Léolo" Lauzon, played by [[Maxime Collin]], who engages in an active [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy life]] while growing up with his Montreal family, and begins to have sexual fantasies about his neighbour Bianca, played by [[Giuditta del Vecchio]]. The film also stars [[Ginette Reno]], [[Pierre Bourgault]], [[Andrée Lachapelle]], [[Denys Arcand]], [[Julien Guiomar]] and [[Germain Houde]]. [[Gilbert Sicotte]] narrates the film as the adult Léolo.

With a story developed by Lauzon as a semi-autobiographical work, the project was supported by producer [[Lyse Lafontaine]] as a co-production with [[Cinema of France|France]]. Filming took place in Montreal and [[Sicily]] in 1991. It was Lauzon's final film, as he died in a [[Accidents and incidents in aviation|plane crash]] in 1997 while working on his next project.

Initially released in the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]], ''Léolo'' won three [[13th Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], including [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for Lauzon, losing [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]] to ''[[Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch]]''. It later benefited from a resurgence of interest, leading to critics and filmmakers adding it to the [[Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time]] in 2015.

==Plot==
In [[Mile End, Montreal]], Léo Lauzon is a young boy living in a tenement with his [[dysfunctional family]], serving as the [[unreliable narrator]]. He uses his active fantasy life and the book ''L'avalée des avalés'' by [[Québécois (word)|Québécois]] novelist [[Réjean Ducharme]] to escape the reality of his life. He feels his father is insane and denies being his son. After having a dream revealing his mother was impregnated after falling into a cart of tomatoes contaminated by an Italian man's semen, Léo identifies as Italian rather than [[French Canadian]] and adopts the name Léolo Lozone.

[[File:Parce que.jpg|200px|thumb|Léolo reads ''L'avalée des avalés'' by [[Réjean Ducharme]].]]
Growing up in an apartment with a rat in the bathtub, a [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] and a family obsessed with regular bowel movements, Léolo continues to write. His writings are discovered by the Word Tamer, a reincarnation of [[Don Quixote]] who searches through trash for letters and photographs. Léolo observes a neighbouring young woman named Bianca and imagines her singing to him from a closet, emitting a white light. His grandfather, who Léolo believes attempted to murder him by holding him under a pool, helps her financially and extorts her for sexual favours, revealing her breasts and putting his feet in her mouth. Léolo begins to fantasize about Bianca sexually and discovers [[masturbation]]. Meanwhile, his brother Fernand, after being beaten by a bully and failed in a [[special education]] class, builds up impressive muscles. The Word Tamer, continuously monitoring Léolo's thoughts, reads of the boy's hopes for how Fernand's muscles will make them invincible. However, upon being confronted by the bully for a second time, Fernand is overwhelmed with fear and is beaten again while Léolo watches in shock.

Finally convinced his grandfather is responsible for all of the family's troubles, Léolo attempts to lower a noose and hang his grandfather while he is in the bath. His grandfather sees Léolo doing it and is choked, before finally being freed, with Léolo injured in the process. Léolo subsequently goes to the hospital, where he is told his actions could constitute [[attempted murder]], though he is not charged. Reacting with horror to the ways other boys are pursuing sex, he seeks out the services of a [[prostitution in Canada|prostitute]] named Regina. Upon later becoming ill, he ends up in the same institution where many other members of his family have been treated at.

==Themes and interpretations==
''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' remarked on the classical allusions in the story:
:Léolo dreams of Sicily, of sunlight and Greek ruins, and of a slender Italian girl, Bianca, a neighbor, whom he imagines standing on a hill in [[Taormina]] singing to him. Léolo is meant to be a modern [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] sitting in one of the dark [[circles of hell|circles of his hell]], and Bianca is his [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date= 3 May 1993 |title=Movies |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |location= |publisher= |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is also related with a "dreamlike environment", with "choral music" that evokes "the possibility of spiritual transcendence". Part of the way the narrative shifts from natural to fantasy elements is through the Word Tamer character, who becomes "an omniscient god-like observer".{{sfn|Rist|2001|p=124}} Author Bill Marshall assessed the Word Tamer as one of the benign elders, as opposed to the bad ones, and hypothesized that the Word Tamer's abode, [[Federico Fellini]]'s [[Cinecittà]] property, symbolizes the film's "exaggerated, grotesque realism".{{sfn|Marshall|2001|p=116}}

[[File:George Melnyk 2014.jpg|thumb|Canadian historian [[George Melnyk]] discussed the film's possible statements on Quebec's "national identity crisis".]]
Some Canadian analysis of ''Léolo'' has related to possible political symbolism and Quebec's national identity. In 1992 at the Toronto International Film Festival, programming director Piers Handling called the film an "epitaph for Quebec", in which the title character rejects his Quebecois identity and joins another world by fantasy.&lt;ref name="Brunette"/&gt; Canadian historian [[George Melnyk]] remarked that [[Pierre Bourgault]] is a prominent Quebec separatist, but is not allowed to say much in the film, which also features the muscular Fernand intimidated by a smaller English Canadian, and non-Quebecois music, concluding the film represented a "national identity crisis".{{sfn|Pike|2012|p=149}} Among the cosmopolitan music uses is Tibetan-style chanting, and songs by [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Tom Waits]].{{sfn|Marshall|2001|p=116}} Film scholar Jim Leach wrote that in real life, Lauzon would call himself a Canadian director, despite contemporary belief Quebec cinema was distinct.{{sfn|Leach|2007|p=49}} In the narration, the setting "Mile End, Montreal, Canada" does not mention Quebec, and Léolo's supposed Italian father refers to the tomatoes as destined for "[[Americas|America]]" rather than Quebec, though they are sold in Montreal.{{sfn|Leach|2007|p=55}} It is also thought the film is set in the late 1950s, in the "old Quebec" before the [[Quiet Revolution]].{{sfn|Melnyk|2014|p=49}}

However, Lauzon denied the film had any political meaning, saying he was not an intellectual,&lt;ref name="Brunette"/&gt; and his film "does not have the flag draped all over it".{{sfn|Pike|2012|p=149}} He also said he had an admiration for the Italian people.{{sfn|Leach|2007|p=51}} Leach questioned if the film is set before the Quiet Revolution, saying if Léolo was born in the 1950s, the 12-year-old character lived in 1965, and Ducharme's book seen in the film was published in 1967.{{sfn|Leach|2007|p=56}} Marshall noted the Ducharme novel would place the story in the 1960s, but argued "otherwise the feel is 1950s".{{sfn|Marshall|2001|p=116}}

==Production==
===Development===
Director [[Jean-Claude Lauzon]] wrote the screenplay, starting it in Sicily while shooting his first film ''[[Night Zoo]]''.{{sfn|Racine|2008|p=118}} It served in part as an [[autobiography]], with Lauzon stating he wrote it "almost in a state of trance" and was initially unsure how the storyline would develop or end.&lt;ref name="Turan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-11/entertainment/ca-317_1_jean-claude-lauzon |title=The Talk of Toronto Film Fest : Movies: Director Jean-Claude Lauzon's 'Leolo' plays to an enthusiastic audience on opening night |last=Turan |first=Kenneth |date=11 September 1992 |accessdate=25 August 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before completing high school and going on to study film in university, Lauzon stated he had lived on "the criminal fringes" of Montreal streets, and his dark perspective is found in ''Léolo''.{{sfn|Toles|2002|p=275}} André Petrowski, a friend of Lauzon, also claimed the film depicted the "gross pathology" of the Lauzon family in a "very, very personal way".{{sfn|Melnyk|2014|p=270}}

Although Lauzon had offers to shoot Hollywood [[action film]]s after ''Night Zoo'' (1987),{{sfn|Leach|2007|p=55}} he instead presented the ''Léolo'' script to producer [[Lyse Lafontaine]]. Lafontaine stated the screenplay had been rejected by other producers and was difficult to read, but she found it "magic" and produced it with [[Aimée Danis]].&lt;ref name="Dillon"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://playbackonline.ca/2015/03/09/playback-canadian-film-tv-hall-of-fame-lyse-lafontaine/ |title=Playback Canadian Film &amp; TV Hall of Fame: Lyse Lafontaine |last=Dillon  |first=Mark |date=9 March 2015 |accessdate=25 August 2016 |work=[[Playback (magazine)|Playback]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had a $5 million budget.&lt;ref name="Lemieux"/&gt;

===Casting===
[[File:Ginette Reno Musée Grévin Montréal.JPG|thumb|[[Ginette Reno]], commemorated by wax sculpture at [[Musée Grévin Montreal]], played the mother after initially rejecting the part for the dark subject matter.]]
Singer [[Ginette Reno]] was cast as the mother after initially rejecting the role, finding the subject matter was "too violent and rough". She was persuaded to star in the film, believing it might win her new fans, even if others were shocked by it.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://montrealgazette.com/sports/a-happy-birthday-to-ginette-reno |title=Life at the top doesn’t faze energetic Reno |last=Kelly  |first=Brendan |date=6 March 1996 |accessdate=25 August 2016 |work=[[The Montreal Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the title role, [[Maxime Collin]] was cast at age 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ici.radio-canada.ca/emissions/medium_large/2011-2012/chronique.asp?idChronique=241088 |title=Léolo, 20 ans plus tard |last=  |first= |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=27 August 2016 |work=[[Radio-Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the part of the Word Tamer, who reads Léolo's writings, Lauzon cast his mentor, university professor [[Pierre Bourgault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Alioff|first=Maurie |date=1992 |title=Léolo  |magazine=[[Take One (Canadian magazine)|Take One]] No. 1|location= |publisher= |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in reality Bourgault is a strong proponent of the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]], Lauzon denied he was cast for political reasons.{{sfn|Leach|2007|p=51}} A bodybuilder, Yves Montmarquette, portrayed Fernand for the scenes after the character builds up his muscles.{{sfn|Pike|2012|p=150}}

Lafontaine's son Mikaël had a small part as a swimmer.&lt;ref name="Petrowski"/&gt; The film's French producers asked Lauzon to use actor [[Pierre Richard]] in the film, which he did not.{{sfn|Racine|2008|p=120}}

===Filming===
The film was shot over 58 days beginning in the fall of 1991, originally in Montreal.&lt;ref name="Lemieux"/&gt; In one scene, Léolo is seen sitting in front of a house, which was where Jean-Claude Lauzon was born.{{sfn|Leach|2007|p=56}} Reno spent three months filming ''Léolo'' over the fall of 1991.&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt; A second stage of filming took place briefly in [[Sicily]].&lt;ref name="Lemieux"/&gt;

Lafontaine found shooting the film difficult because of Lauzon's emotional swings,&lt;ref name="Dillon"/&gt; although Reno found him affectionate.&lt;ref name="Lemieux"/&gt; Lauzon asserted those who found him too temperamental to work with did not know him well, and he had a history of good relations with film departments.{{sfn|Racine|2008|p=120}} When Lafontaine traveled to Italy with Lauzon, he gave her a letter thanking her for her ineptitude in business, which he considered necessary to make a film with feeling. She kept it as a cherished keepsake.&lt;ref name="Petrowski"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/cinema/cinema-quebecois/entrevues/201706/01/01-5103445-lyse-lafontaine-la-missionnaire-aventuriere-du-cinema.php |title=Lyse Lafontaine: la missionnaire aventurière du cinéma |last=Petrowski |first=Nathalie |date=1 June 2017 |accessdate=5 June 2017 |work=[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one scene, a boy commits an act of [[bestiality]] with a tied-down cat. Lauzon initially intended to use a [[puppet]] for the cat in a rehearsal, but the actor objected that it would be ridiculous, insisting on a real cat.&lt;ref name="Alioff"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Alioff|first=Maurie |date=1992 |title=Léolo  |magazine=[[Take One (Canadian magazine)|Take One]] No. 1|location= |publisher= |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
Canadian critic [[Brian D. Johnson]], writing for ''[[Maclean's]]'', said the film "elevates [[Cinema of Canada|Canadian cinema]] to new heights of creative ambition and achievement".{{sfn|Melnyk|2004|p=203}} [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four stars, writing "''Léolo'' is an enchanting, disgusting, romantic, depressing, hilarious, tragic movie, and it is quite original- one of the year's best.

===Accolades===
The film was selected as the Canadian entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[65th Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1992/film/news/foreign-oscar-entries-submitted-101796/ |title=Foreign Oscar entries submitted |accessdate=20 September 2015 |work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was selected for competition for the [[Palme d'Or]] at Cannes, and its loss caused critics to accuse the jury of conservative choices.&lt;ref name="Alioff"/&gt;

At the [[13th Genie Awards]], ''Léolo'' received nine nominations and was perceived as being in an unusually tight competition with [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1992/film/news/lunch-leolo-to-battle-for-top-92-genie-honors-101397/ |title=‘Lunch,’ ‘Leolo’ to battle for top ’92 Genie honors |last=Ayscough |first=Suzan |date=14 October 1992 |accessdate=25 August 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Naked Lunch'' was considered to have triumphed over ''Leolo'' on awards night.{{sfn|Melnyk|2004|p=203}}

The '''musical short''' (a.k.a. '''musical short film''', a.k.a. '''musical featurette''') can be traced back to the earliest days of sound films.

Performers in the [[Lee De Forest]] Phonofilms of 1923-24 included [[Eddie Cantor]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], [[Abbie Mitchell]] ("The Colored Prima Donna") and comic singer-dancer [[Molly Picon]], plus the team of [[Noble Sissel]] and [[Eubie Blake]]. The husband-and-wife vaudeville team of [[Eva Puck]] and [[Sammy White (actor)|Sammy White]] (billed as Puck and White) starred in the Phonofilm ''Opera vs. Jazz'' (1923). [[Max Fleischer]] used the Phonofilm process in 1924 when he introduced his animated ''[[Sound Car-Tunes|Song Car-Tunes]]'' series.&lt;ref name=dark/&gt;

==Vitaphone==
The nearly 2,000 [[Vitaphone]] [[short subject]]s produced by [[Warner Bros.]] and its sister studio [[First National Pictures|First National]] from 1926 to 1930 included vaudevillians, opera singers, Broadway stars, dancers, bands and popular vocalists. One and two-reel short musical films were valuable to the movie studios as springboards for new talents. Performers who made their film debuts in short films include [[Joan Blondell]], [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Burns and Allen]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Judy Garland]] (as Baby Gumm), [[Cary Grant]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Bert Lahr]] and [[Ginger Rogers]].&lt;ref name=dark&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V_C3AmDL314C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22a+song+in+the+dark%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=gsOABsrZS0quBt7JKQD0_bPY0mw Barrios, Richard. ''A Song in the Dark: The Birth of the Musical Film'', Oxford University Press, 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ruth Etting]] sang "My Mother's Eyes" (by Abel Baer and L. Wolfe Gilbert) and "That's Him Now" (by Milton Ager and Jack Yellen) in the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] Movietone ''Ruth Etting in Favorite Melodies'' (1929), filmed in a single take at the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios|Astoria Studios]] in [[Queens, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262190/|title=Ruth Etting|author=|date=|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astoria Studios was built by Paramount in the early days of sound films to provide the company with an audio-capable facility close to the Broadway theater district. Many features and short subjects were filmed there between 1928 and 1933, including the 16-minute ''[[St. Louis Blues (1929 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'' (1929), the only film of [[Bessie Smith]].&lt;ref name=dark/&gt;

==1930s==
Orchestra leader [[Phil Spitalny]] made a series of musical shorts beginning with ''Phil Spitalny'' (1929) at [[MGM]], followed by shorts for both Vitaphone and Paramount, including ''Big City Fantasy'' (1929), ''Phil Spitalny and His Musical Queens'' (1934), ''Ladies That Play'' (1934), ''Phil Spitalny and His All Girl Orchestra'' (1935) and ''Sirens of Syncopation'' (1935).

For promotional purposes, major film stars, including [[Gary Cooper]] and [[Clark Gable]], made guest appearances in such musical shorts as MGM's ''Star Night at the Cocoanut Grove'' (1934) and ''[[Starlit Days at the Lido]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0SoIHyxrQM|title=Early three-strip Technicolor in HD -- Henry Busse and His Band -- Hot Lips -- Read Notes!|first=|last=jackusdk|date=9 February 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1935), while others featured a single band, such as ''[[Fred Rich|Freddie Rich and His Orchestra]]'' (1938).

[[Richard Barrios]] (author of ''A Song in the Dark: The Birth of the Musical Film'') provided notes for Kino Video's compilation, ''The Best of Big Bands and Swing'':
:During the "Dawn of Sound," musical short subjects were the ''[[hors d'œuvre]]'' before the main feature, and an effective means for the studio to test their freshly signed talent in front of the camera. Aggressively pursuing the top singers, songwriters and musicians of Tin Pan Alley, Paramount's roster of contract players was composed of some of the top names in the world of entertainment. Cary Grant makes his film debut as a sailor cruising the Far East in search of whoopee in ''Singapore Sue''. [[Artie Shaw]] presents a master class in the elementals of swingband construction ([[Artie Shaw]]'s ''Class In Swing''). A very young [[Bing Crosby]] croons three ballads in ''Dream House'', a comedy-musical directed by slapstick impresario [[Mack Sennett]]. This collection showcases several top female vocalists, including [[Ethel Merman]] (''Her Future''), [[Ruth Etting]] (''Favorite Melodies'' and [[Lillian Roth]] (''Meet The Boyfriend''). There's also a two-edged homage to that icon of 1930s naughtiness, [[Betty Boop]], with appearances by Betty's prototype, "Boop-a-Doop Girl" [[Helen Kane]] (''A Lesson In Love''), and Betty's actual voice, [[Mae Questel]] (''Musical Doctor'', in which [[Rudy Vallee|Dr. Rudy Vallee]] finds musical deficiencies to be the root of all ills). Perhaps the gem of this collection, however, is ''Office Blues'', in which a pre-[[Fred Astaire|Astaire]] and pre-stardom [[Ginger Rogers]] cavorts with Broadway chorines in an Art Deco extravaganza. With artists like these on the bill it's clear that the short subject -- not the feature -- was often the highlight of the program!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kino.com/video/item.php?film_id=640 Barrios, Richard.

==1940s==
[[Image:Lopezhutton.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Vincent Lopez and Betty Hutton in 1939.]]
In the late 1930s and early 1940s, [[Betty Hutton]] made a half-dozen musical shorts before her feature debut in ''[[The Fleet's In]]'' (1942) and then continued to make shorts for the war effort. She was seen in ''Paramount Headliner: Queens of the Air'' (1938), Vitaphone's ''Vincent Lopez and His Orchestra'' (1939), ''Broadway Brevities: One for the Book'' (1939), ''Paramount Headliner: Three Kings and a Queen'' (1939), ''Broadway Brevities: Public Jitterbug Number One'' (1939), ''Paramount Victory Short No. T2-1: [[A Letter from Bataan]]'' (1942), ''Army-Navy Screen Magazine #20: Strictly G.I.'' (1943), Paramount's ''Skirmish on the Home Front'' (1944) and ''Hollywood Victory Caravan'' (1945), produced on the Paramount lot by the Treasury Department for the 1945 Victory Loan Drive. Several of Hutton's musical shorts have been shown on [[Turner Classic Movies]] in recent years.

Modern jazz was added to the mix in such films as the 16-minute ''Artistry in Rhytym'' (1944), with [[Stan Kenton]] and [[Anita O'Day]], later re-edited into another short, ''Cool and Groovy'' (1956), which also featured [[Chico Hamilton]] and [[The Hi-Los]]. In the mid-1940s, [[Louis Jordan]] made short music films, some of which were spliced together into a feature-length musical Western, ''Look-Out Sister'' (1947).

==Television==
During the 1950s, musical shorts were revived for telecasting on local stations. Feature films in that decade were usually not edited to fit. Instead, if a feature ended 20 minutes before the hour, footage from musical shorts was used to fill the gap.

[[Snader Telescriptions]] were musical shorts made for television from 1950 to 1954. There were thousands of these three- and four-minute films, covering various genres from jazz and pop to R&amp;B and country. Louis "Duke" Goldstone directed for Louis D. Snader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macfilms.com/snader.htm|title=Snader Telescriptions|author=|date=|website=macfilms.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Newspaper Libel and Registration Act 1881''' (44 &amp; 45 Vict. c.60) was an act passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Introduced as a [[Private Member's Bill]], it reduced the legislative burden on newspaper proprietors with regard to the offence of [[libel]]; as a ''quid pro quo'', the compulsory registration of proprietors (abolished by the [[Newspapers, Printers, and Reading Rooms Repeal Act 1869]]) was reintroduced.&lt;ref name="O'MalleySoley2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tom O'Malley|author2=Clive Soley|title=Regulating The Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r47jvyaECDoC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=20 November 2000|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-1197-5|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the removal of compulsory registration in 1869, newspaper owners had begun to look to anonymity as a protection against lawsuits arising out of the publication of libellous statements.&lt;ref name="O'MalleySoley2000"/&gt; At the same time, the judgment in ''[[Purcell v Sowler]]'' (1877) saw a newspaper proprietor successfully sued despite recognition that the libellous statements his newspaper had published were merely quoted verbatim from the testimony of a member of the public made at public meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldjudgmt/jd991028/rey02.htm|title=Judgment -House of Lords - Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Limited and Others|publisher=parliament.uk|accessdate=13 April 2012|author=Lord Nicholas of Birkenhead|date=28 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against this backdrop, two successive [[select committee]]s were established to look at the law of libel; the first made no report, but the second took on the evidence of the first, and made several recommendations. In the words of [[John Dyson Hutchinson|John Hutchinson]], MP for [[Halifax (UK Parliament constituency)|Halifax]], "the Bill embodied the recommendations of [the second] Committee, and was confined to them exclusively".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1881/may/11/newspapers-law-of-libel-bill#S3V0261P0_18810511_HOC_21|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=13 April 2012|title=Newspapers (law of libel) bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill itself took the form of a [[Private Member's Bill]].&lt;ref name="O'MalleySoley2000"/&gt;

In terms of content, section 2 of the Act (as it became when it received royal assent on 27 August 1881&lt;ref name="legislation"/&gt;) introduced a new defence for newspaper proprietors in cases where the libel stemmed from a fair, accurate and non-malicious report of a publicly held meeting.&lt;ref name="O'MalleySoley2000"/&gt; This extension of [[qualified privilege]] was then "amplified" by the [[Law of Libel Amendment Act 1888]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=26|journal=California Law Review|page=239 |year=1938|title=Preserving Liberty of the Press by the Defense of Privilege in Libel Actions|author=John M. Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in doing so repealed section 2 of the 1881 Act. Repealed at the same time was section 3 ("No prosecution for newspaper libel without fiat of Attorney General").&lt;ref name="legislation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/44-45/60|title=Newspaper Libel and Registration Act 1881|publisher=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also benefited newspaper owners insofar as it instituted provisions (section 4, 5 and 6) for the quicker (and hence cheaper) resolution of newspaper libel cases.&lt;ref name="O'MalleySoley2000"/&gt; Contrary to expectations, however, the passage of the Act correlated with an increase, rather than decrease, in the number of [[defamatory libel]] (criminal) actions being brought against newspapers. Whether the two were causally linked is not known, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/consultation%20papers/cpCrimeofLibel.htm|title=Consultation paper on the crime of libel|publisher=The Law Reform Commission|location=Ireland|date=August 1991|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In return, proprietors were happy to accept the reintroduction of compulsory registration that had been removed in 1869 (now provided for by sections 7 to 15 of the 1881 Act inclusive).&lt;ref name="O'MalleySoley2000"/&gt; These registration clauses, which included an exemption for proprietors who are already registered companies, were not repealed until 2015&lt;ref name="legislation"/&gt; and were still enforced.&lt;ref name="companieshouse"/&gt; For the purposes of the Act, a newspaper is defined as "any paper containing public news, intelligence, or occurrences, or any remarks or observations therein printed for sale, and published ... periodically, or in parts or numbers at intervals not exceeding 26 days".&lt;ref name="companieshouse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about//pdf/gpo3.pdf|date=May 2011|publisher=Companies House|title=Newspaper Libel and Registration Act 1881|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, 56 newspapers and their proprietors were centrally registered as a result of these provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inforrm.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/list-of-newspaper-registrations.doc|title=Newspapers Database - List|publisher=Companies House|year=2010|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under section 19 of the Act, it never applied to Scotland.&lt;ref name="legislation"/&gt;

The provisions on registration in sections 7 to 18 were repealed by the [[Deregulation Act 2015]] as being no longer of practical use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/20/schedule/23 Deregulation Act 2015, Schedule 23.]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, only section 4 remains in force, and that only in relation to Northern Ireland and courts hearing charges there of [[blasphemous libel]].

In the [[comic book]] publishing industry, a '''one-shot''' is a comic book published as a single, standalone issue, with a self-contained story, and not as part of an ongoing series or [[miniseries (comics)|miniseries]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert, Aaron. [http://comicbooks.about.com/od/glossary/g/One-Shot-Definition.htm "One Shot Definition"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118194924/http://comicbooks.about.com/od/glossary/g/One-Shot-Definition.htm |date=2012-11-18 }}. [[About Entertainment]]. Retrieved July 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In the television industry, one-shots sometimes serve as a [[television pilot|pilot]] to field interest in a new series.{{fact|date=July 2016}}

==Japan==
In the [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] industry, the concept of one-shot is expressed by the term {{nihongo|''yomikiri''|読み切り}}, which implies that the comic is presented in its entirety without any continuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/8390/what-is-the-purpose-of-one-shot-manga|title=What is the purpose of one-shot manga?|website=anime.stackexchange.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; One-shot manga are often written for contests, and sometimes later developed into a full-length manga series (much like a [[television pilot]]). Many popular manga series began as one-shot stories, including ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]'', ''[[Fist of the North Star]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'', ''[[One Piece]]'', ''[[Berserk (manga)|Berserk]]'', ''[[Kinnikuman]]'' and ''[[Death Note]]'', among others. Some noted manga authors, such as [[Akira Toriyama]] and [[Rumiko Takahashi]], have worked on numerous one-shot stories in addition to their serialized works. ''[[Rising Stars of Manga]]'' was an annual competition for [[original English-language manga|original English-language]] one-shot manga, many of which have gone on to become full-length manga series.

==United States==
In the [[United States]], one-shots are usually labeled with a "#1" despite there being no following issues, and are sometimes [[subtitle (titling)|subtitled]] as "specials".  On occasion, a character or concept will appear in a series of one-shots, in cases where the subject matter is not financially lucrative enough to merit an [[ongoing series|ongoing]] or [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], but still popular enough to be published on a regular basis, often annually or quarterly. A current example of a series of one-shots would be [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Franklin Richards: Son of a Genius]]'' publications. This type of one-shot is not to be confused with a [[Annual publication#Comic books|comic book annual]], which is typically a companion publication to an established ongoing series.{{fact|date=July 2016}}

==Other countries==
The term has also been borrowed into the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] industry, with basically the same meaning, although there, it mostly refers to [[comic album|albums]].{{fact|date=July 2016}}

==Synopsis==
In a fictitious music school, the students of [[Chinese orchestra]] and [[Orchestra|Classical orchestra]] don't get along with each other. They call each other "''tacky''" and "''pretentious''". Chen Jing, a quirky but talented [[yangqin]] student, initially doesn't care about the rivalry, until she falls for the piano prodigy Wang Wen. Annoyed at his ignorance and prejudice toward Chinese instruments, she is determined to prove herself to him by forming her own ensemble, which consists of her best friend who secretly loves her Li You and four ''[[Otaku]]'' girls whom initially only agreed to join because of Chen Jing's promise to buy them expensive [[action figure]]s. They named their [[concert band]] "''2.5 Dimension''", meaning a blend between 2D and 3D worlds, as the Otaku people refer to themselves as living in the second dimension. They perform at an Animation, Comics, and Games convention, and after initial rejection the crowd cheers for them.

They perform for Wang Wen but he publicly rejects Chen Jing and traditional Chinese music. Crushed, Chen Jing chooses to disband 2.5 Dimension. The four Otaku students, who have grown to love the band, are angry and refuse Chen Jing's gift of expensive action figures. Chen Jing's mother tells her about how the yangqin is a part of her and that she can't give up playing it without its permission.  The head of the school announces plans to cancel the Chinese Orchestra but the original members of 2.5 Dimension are joined by other students to protest. After the head of the school continues to refuse them, they organize a music competition with the Classical Orchestra. An inspector comes to the school and both orchestras play their music.

[[File:Pepassemblyatschool.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A group of students cheering and clapping at their high school pep assembly.]]
A '''pep rally''' or '''pep assembly''' is a gathering of people, typically students of [[middle school]], [[high school]], and [[university|college]] age, before a [[sports]] event. The purpose of such a gathering is to encourage [[school spirit]] and to support members of the [[team]]. It is generally seen as an [[United States|American]] phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/daniel-m-cooke/uk-vs-usa-school-pride_b_2696346.html|title=UK vs. USA - School Pride|date=2013-02-19|work=HuffPost UK|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a pep rally, cheerleaders lead in boisterous chants and dance moves intended to get the student body excited. Games between competing classes with small prizes may be held. The school's [[School band|band]] often play upbeat music in between demonstrations, and the [[drumline]] may play. The school's choir may sing "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" to the crowd. In the case of a [[homecoming]] game, the Homecoming "court" may be chosen and announced.

This is also a time for the team captains to let the school know how their team are doing this season. Most schools have pep rallies to honor future and past events.

[[College basketball]] teams celebrate the opening of the season with [[Midnight Madness (basketball)|Midnight Madness]], an event similar to a pep rally.

'''Peter Gatien''' (born August 8, 1952) is a [[Canadian]] club owner and party promoter. He is best known as the former owner of several prominent [[New York City|New York]] [[nightclub]]s, including Club USA, [[The Limelight]], [[Palladium (club)|Palladium]], and [[Tunnel (New York nightclub)|Tunnel]].
==Life and career==
Gatien was born in [[Cornwall, Ontario]], the third of five brothers.&lt;ref name="canadianbusiness.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/managing/ceo_interviews/article.jsp?content=20060605_78346_78346 |author=Mlynek, Alex |date=June 2006 |magazine=Canadian Business |title=Live and Learn (CEO Interviews): Peter Gatien |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825153608/http://www.canadianbusiness.com/managing/ceo_interviews/article.jsp?content=20060605_78346_78346 |archivedate=2006-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first business venture was a [[jeans]] store in his home town, which he opened with a $13,000 settlement after he lost an eye in a hockey accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/limelight-doc-tells-outlandish-tale-of-canadians-rise-and-fall-in-nyc/article2176409/ |title=Limelight: Doc tells outlandish tale of Canadian's rise and fall in NYC |date=September 23, 2011 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |author=Cole, Stephen }}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, he turned a former [[country western]] bar into a [[rock music|rock]] club called Aardvark and booked the band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] to perform.&lt;ref name="canadianbusiness.com"/&gt;  In 1976, he read about a bankrupt nightclub in [[Florida]] known as Rumbottoms; the space became the first incarnation of [[The Limelight]]. Limelight [[Atlanta]] followed. The longest period of time in which The Limelight remained closed was from 1996 to 1998. It reopened from 1998 until Gatien sold it in 2001, to a real estate developer.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Gatien produced the film ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'' (1993), starring [[Robert De Niro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0309686|name=Peter Gatien}}&lt;/ref&gt; after having produced it as a one-man play starring [[Chazz Palminteri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/managing/ceo_interviews/article.jsp?content=20060605_78346_78346&amp;page=2 |work=Canadian Business |title=Peter Gatien |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312084547/http://www.canadianbusiness.com/managing/ceo_interviews/article.jsp?content=20060605_78346_78346&amp;page=2 |archivedate=2007-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 federal investigation attempted but failed to link Gatien to the sales of party drugs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=Possible Trial Witness Dies|date=January 14, 1998|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/14/nyregion/possible-trial-witness-dies.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  especially [[MDMA|ecstasy]], in his clubs, but his acquittal in 1998 left him with huge legal fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/fashion/peter-gatien-the-fallen-king-of-night-life.html?pagewanted=all |title=Peter Gatien, Club King Without a Club |date=September 21, 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Murphy, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he was later arrested on tax evasion charges after a series of club raids; he was acquitted of most of the charges. He pleaded guilty to [[tax evasion]] in 1999, for which he was sentenced to a fine of $1.6 million and a 60-day [[prison]] sentence, along with 5 years' probation. In 2003, he was [[deported]] to his native Canada, under the [[Department of Homeland Security]] [[immigration]] laws which order the removal of any [[alien (law)|alien]] (non-citizen) convicted of a [[felony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Lianne George |date=Aug 2012 |url= http://nymag.com/nightlife/features/17066/ |title= Bright Lights, Medium-Size City |work= New York Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because he is part [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Canadian]], Gatien has since been able to visit the United States again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/rush_molloy/2007/08/14/2007-08-14_gatien_returns_to_us_on_indian_path.html |accessdate=January 22, 2008 |title=Gatien returns to U.S. on Indian path |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=August 14, 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122045634/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/rush_molloy/2007/08/14/2007-08-14_gatien_returns_to_us_on_indian_path.html |archivedate=January 22, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gatien relocated to [[Toronto]], where he opened a {{convert|55,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} entertainment venue, Circa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fabmagazine.com/features/292/Second_Coming.html |title=Second coming for Toronto's club scene|work=Fab Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, he was no longer involved with Circa and has been out of the nightclub business since that time. Circa was forced into bankruptcy and closed its doors in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://torontojungle.com/forum/showthread.php/69512-The-rise-and-fall-of-Circa-nightclub |title=The Downfall of Circa Night Club |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025062520/http://torontojungle.com/forum/showthread.php/69512-The-rise-and-fall-of-Circa-nightclub |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Piposh''''' ({{lang-he|'''פיפוש'''}}) is an [[Israel|Israeli]] media franchise that commenced with a series of comedic [[Point and click|point-and-click]] [[Adventure game|adventure video games]] developed by Guillotine and published by [[Hed Arzi Multimedia]] for Windows. Based around the eponymous actor-turned-detective who embarks on several adventures solving murders, the titles include ''Piposh'', ''Piposh 2'', ''Halom SheItgashem'' (spinoff), and ''Piposh 3D: HaMahapecha''. An English version of ''Piposh'' entitled ''Piposh: Hollywood'' was released in either 2002 or 2004. The series, which began in 1999, was created at a time when the Israeli video gaming industry was at its peak, particularly in terms of adventure gaming, and served as an notable example of a work targeted specifically at the young local market, with aspects such as inside jokes relating to Israeli culture. The games became very popular, although never becoming financially successful, and its developers struggled to live off the proceeds.

''Piposh'' evolved into a franchise, with a television series, a comic book, and an album being created. The series continues to have a dedicated fanbase, and conventions known as 'Piposh Congresses' have been regularly held as a way for fans to celebrate the games together. While the titles have often been criticised for their amateurish visual style and clunky game mechanics, they are looked at fondly by critics who see ''Piposh'' as a source of Israeli pride and a key milestone in the advancement of the local industry throughout the 21st century.

== Plot and gameplay ==

The series consists of point and click adventures, requiring players to interact with an inventory and with characters in order to complete puzzles and advance the story.

==History==

=== Conception and ''In the Interest of Ratings'' ===
After Renen Glutzman left the Israeli army and while his brother Roy was still a member, they set up a small graphics business in [[Pardes Hanna-Karkur|Pardes Hanna]] (פרדס חנה), where they did routine projects for commission.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.928084|title=Piposh hangs the keyboard|last=Smooha|first=Shahar|date=January 12, 2003|work=Haaretz|access-date=May 26, 2018|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, one of their projects reached the desk of the CEO of video game distributor Hed Artzi Multimedia (הד ארצי מולטימדיה), the multimedia arm of Israeli record label [[Hed Arzi Music]], who liked the illustration style of the duo and suggested they create a Hebrew-language computer game. He gave them [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]] 10,000 in return for 50% of the future profits from the sales.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Despite having no experience in the video gaming industry, the team went to work and after nine months of development, released ''[[In the Interest of Ratings]] (בתככי הרייטינג)'', a title which focused on the incompetent detective Elimelech Egoz (voiced by Moshe Ferster), who goes on holiday at the fictional Nofei Hadera Hotel only to be greeted by a bizarre murder case.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timeout.co.il/%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%95%D7%97%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%92%D7%99%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A8-%D7%A0%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%97%D7%A7-%D7%94%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%A2%D7%9D-%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A9-%D7%95-%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%9B%D7%9B|title=The Game of Life: An Interview with the Creators of "Piposh" and "The Ratings Games"|last=Blau|first=Dune|date=July 10, 2014|work=TimeOut|access-date=May 26, 2018|language=he-IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game contained intertextuality, inside jokes, irony, and cynicism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''In the Interest of Ratings'' received negative reviews in the press, including in ''Internet Captain (קפטן האינטרנט''), the technology/multimedia branch of the leading Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]''; however it received positive reviews in youth-oriented newspapers. Ultimately the game was relatively popular, though it was not financially successful.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; But it led the duo to decide to try to develop a second video game, which would become ''Piposh''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;, under their new development company Guillotine (גיליוטין).

=== ''Piposh'' ===
The Gluzman brothers wrote the text and the code, drew the backgrounds and characters, and created the animations; in addition they convinced actors Shai Avivi, Amos Shuv, Anat Magen, Ilan Peled, Dudu Zar, Meni Pe'er, and Ilan Ganani (as Piposh) to voice characters voluntarily.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The game was developed by four people in their garage, at a time when the computer gaming industry in Israel was considered non-existent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3540692,00.html|title=In honor of Independence Day: "Piposh" free download|last=Birab|first=Yuval|date=August 5, 2008|work=Ynet|access-date=May 26, 2018|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glutzman recalls that Guillotine was not particularly well managed, lacked business planning and didn't have a financial focus, and instead consisted of a naive team who wanted to simply make something "fun and cool".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''[[Ynet]]'' asserts the duo was irrational for choosing set up a development company for Israeli games that only appealed to the local market.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Ronen would later describe the contemporary Israeli video gaming industry as an imaginary thing to pursue, for four young developers working from their garage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During development, Renen used the program ''[[Macromedia Director|Macromedia Director 4]]'', and he created each game screens from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whileiwasworking.blogspot.com/2008/05/piposh.html|title=Piposh / פיפוש|last=Gafni|first=Etay|date=May 9, 2008|website=WHILE I WAS WORKING...|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the game's release, Renen published his phone number to allow stuck players to phone in for help.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===  Rest of the series ===
Roy left the series during production of the second game, believing that in addition to piracy, the distribution networks weren't as efficient at bringing video games to stores as other products like Israeli music.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to Renen, his brother did not have prowess in the business and marketing side to succeed in the industry.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514015759/http://news.vgames.co.il/article.aspx?SectionID=2119|title=Special for Yom HaAtzma'ut: Greetings to Piposh|last=Beirav|first=Yuval|date=August 5, 2008|website=Vgames|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After leaving, Roy moved away from sensationalist nature of the entertainment and gaming industry, and instead focused in personal creative projects.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; On his own Renen began to suffer financially, which would continue for years while making the Piposh games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.makorrishon.co.il/nrg/online/16/ART/968/091.html|title=Game theory|last=Globerman|first=Dror|date=August 8, 2005|website=Maariv|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2003 he was living on 30 shekels a day.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; He would later explain that at the time, to be a video game developer in Israel, one was expected not to make money.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While the first game took 1.5 years to make, the team spent a year making Piposh 2, and a year making ''Halom SheItgashem''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.piposh.co.il/NK/NK3.htm|title=An interview with Renan and Roi Gluzman about Nahum Heiman and Ya'akov Katz...|last=Gluzman|first=Renan and Roi|date=2018|website=Piposh.co.il|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each time the developers made a game, they did it independently and without external funding.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Once a title neared completion, Guillotine spoke to their distribution company to print discs and send them to stores.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, as the distribution company was very large they didn't have time to invest into a small local game like ''Piposh'' so the games ended up being sent out two weeks later than intended, once the advertising and buzz had died down.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; For each title, Renan produced advertising materials such as posters, business cards and funny stickers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

''Piposh 3D'' was the series' first foray into 3D graphics, after using traditional animation for the previous games; this title was directed by Roy Lazarowitz.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.piposh.co.il/DETAILS.htm|title=Disclosure and incriminating information about Gilliotin|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Piposh.co.il|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this point the developers had grown tired of their distributor and sought to use Indogram, which represented fewer games and could therefore invest more time into each.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It was developed using the A5 engine, which Guillotine had purchase specifically for this title.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; 2004 saw the English release of ''Piposh'' entitled ''Piposh Holywood'', which was to be published by The Phantom after [[Phantom Entertainment]] bought the distribution rights electronically. ''Ynet'' noted that if successful, it would have been a notable achievement for the industry, seeing the first Israeli video game released on console, but noting the unclear outcome of this venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-2858473,00.html|title=Piposh will ride The Phantom|last=Moore|first=Noam|date=January 13, 2004|website=Ynet|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guillotine had aimed to translate their first Piposh game to break it into the international market, however the text and dubbing translations became an astronomical task due to the original game having a badly-constructed programming interface.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.2all.co.il/web/sites/hezipiposh/PAGE7.asp|title=Piposh Hollywood|last=|first=|date=2018|website=www.2all.co.il|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foreign adaption of the first game is known worldwide by its English title.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The games were not intended to meet the technological standards of the global industry, particularly in terms of graphics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They were not targeted to a worldwide audience, instead appealing to Israeli teenagers who were not necessarily gamers, but who wanted immature content with cultural references they would understand.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ''Haaretz'' contends that despite the development team tapping into the minds of local youth, the rampant pirate copying phenomenon prevented them from making a living of their games.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

''Piposh'' saw numerous opportunities for franchise expansion over its history. The team gave up a NIS 20,000 offer by [[Burgeranch|Burger Ranch]] to distribute the games because they were vegetarians.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3540692,00.html|title=In honor of Independence Day: "Piposh" free download|last=Birab|first=Yuval|date=August 5, 2008|work=Ynet|access-date=May 26, 2018|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also lectured to youth at an animation and comics festival at the Tel Aviv Cinematheque.&lt;ref name="auto22" /&gt; In 2000, the developers thought of porting Piposh to mobile phones, having already set up documents such as an instillation guide;

=== Aftermath ===
The last title developed by Guillotine was the network-strategy nonsense game Vajimon, which saw players fight against each other over the internet using a variety of vegetables.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Around 2003-4, the company's operations were terminated and its managers retired.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216010237/www.piposh2ah.2us.co.il/|title=Welcome to the new site of Search 2.5|last=|first=|date=December 16, 2008|website=Sellotape|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronen left the industry soon after due to the financial and mental burden the series had given him&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;, and became a yacht skipper.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He earned money as a writer of games for interactive TV and cell phone in a leading high tech company.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; In 2005, the brothers lectured for a Gameology course at Beit Berl College as part of the first Israeli curriculum course for video game development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.co.il/captain/games/1.1511799|title=For the first time in Israel, a path for game developers|last=Yaron|first=Oded|date=March 21, 2005|work=Haaretz|access-date=May 26, 2018|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was started by Dr. Diana Silverman Keller who discovered while writing her thesis that there was no formal education in the field of game creation in the country.

Renen Gluzman noted that the games were unplayable unless the gamer had a Windows 95 computer, and commented "I felt that I had to do this, in order to save the game from falling into the abyss".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By this time, it was impossible to get the games anymore, and there were no orderly backups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He noted it was strange to revisit these games after having not touched them since the series ended in 2003.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tal Dinovich, a fan of the series who had volunteered for years on the site and answered phone called from stuck players, helped locate all the game files and create updated versions that would work on Windows XP.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While Renen has since moved on from the series, he did create a Facebook group for the fans who had grown up with the series and wanted to reminisce.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to [[Calcalist]], the series released 7 games, 4 of which are available for free download.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.calcalist.co.il/internet/articles/0,7340,L-3287147,00.html|title=Play Free: 24 full games|last=Yogev|first=Audi|date=May 27, 2009|work=Calcalist|access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the campaign, Ronen aimed to print special nostalgic shirts, as this was a common fan request.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In December 2008, a group of Piposh fans, believing that it had died prematurely, started a campaign to create a new chapter of the series and started looking for volunteers. The game, to be developed through their company Sellotape (סלוטייפ) was entitled ''Piposh 2.5 and the Stolen Vase''.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.is/6Epca#selection-2717.143-2717.171|title=Piposh 2.5?|last=David|first=Noa|date=December 12, 2008|website=Nana 10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official website of the project wrote that while the developers were unable to reach the quality level of the official games, they hoped to emulate it as much as possible.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Their aim was to "remember, save, and enjoy" the Piposh series.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The plot, taking place immediately after Piposh 2, sawthe protagonist try to find the magic 'vase of life' that can be used by his to resurrect characters to died in the prequel.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.2all.co.il/web/sites/hezipiposh/PAGE16.asp|title=Piposh 2 and a half – the stolen vase|last=|first=|date=2018|website=www.2all.co.il|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producer/director was Ben Werchizer, the artist/designer was Daniel Avdo, the music and dubbing                producer was Itay Jeroffi, and the writer was Shahar Kraus;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; they were looking for professional programmers in Director or Flash&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; as well as voice talent.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Their site contained a "build your own character" minigame from the series as a flash game, and a forum dedicated to the resurrection of Piposh.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The project was discontinued around 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.xplace.com/il/en/job/12362|title=We need a programmer to develop a sequel to the Israeli series "Piposh" in the Piposh style on Macromedia Direcor|last=|first=|date=June 7, 2010|website=Xplace|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video game archivist and founder of the ''Movement for Preservation of Games in Israel'' Raphael Ben-Ari got in touch with the series' creators and detailed the story behind its development process and in a documentary film.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ShimurIsrael/posts/1398126163819442|title=Piposh|last=Ben-Ari|first=Raphael|date=February 25, 2016|website=Movement for Preservation of Games in Israel|publisher=Facebook|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary was uploaded to YouTube on Ben-Ari's ''Oldschool'' account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28jxusMNkhw|title=The most fun game in Hebrew (and how it was developed)|last=Ben-Ari|first=Raphael|date=Feb 25, 2016|website=Oldschool|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben-Ari believes the work boosted the Piposh community in Israel and introduced the series to many new people.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== State of Israeli industry at the time ==
The Israeli video gaming industry was at its peak in the 1990s, with several companies creating games, developing engines, and trying to become successful both at home and abroad. One example is [[:he:מחשבת (חברה)|Machshevet]] (מחשבת), which began as an importer and translator of games to the Israeli market. In the mid-1990s, the company would create children's video games based on popular legends and fairytales.called 'CD Pedoph' (סי.די פדוף"). Created during the golden age of the point and click adventure games, two of Machshevet's popular titles are: ''[[:he:שליט המימדים|Dimension Commander: The Adventures of Wonderland]]'' (שליט המימדים: מסע ההרפתקאות המופלא) (1996) and [[Armed &amp; Delirious|''Armed &amp; Delirious'']] (1997).&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Compedia (קומפדיה), while primarily a technologies, platforms and systems developer, also created educational computer games which were distributed to over 40 countries, including the ''Advanced Thinking Skills'' series (1992–93), the ''Timmy'' series (1994–95), the ''Gordy'' series (סדרת גורדי), the ''Itamar'' series (סדרת איתמר), ''Gordy in the Movie Adventure'' (גורדי בהרפתקה מהסרטים), ''In Search of the Lost Words'' (בעקבות המילים האבודות 1996/1998), and ''Julia: Back to the Sweet 60's'' (2001).  Other notable Israeli video games of the time include: ''[[Xonix]]'' (1984), ''Intifada'' (אינתיפאדה 1989), and [[:he:סוחר הים (משחק מחשב)|''The Sea Dealer'']] (סוחר הים 1989), ''Bonus'' (בונוס),  ''Avish'' (אביש 1993), ''Duvalle'' (דובל'ה 1993-1997), [[Jane's IAF: Israeli Air Force|''Jane's IAF: Israeli Air Force'']] (1998), and ''You Think You're Smart'' (אתה חושב שאתה חכם 1998-2001).&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Throughout the 1990s, Israeli developers also created various "silly little games...to promote children's food products" such as Vered Hagalil and Bamba.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Factor believed that while the 80s and 90s saw the serious development of games within Israel, with the country being at the peak of its video gaming industry, it was still defined by a level of inferiority on the world stage, which had only started to improve in the early 2010s with social and casual gaming apps.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Makorrishon wrote that Piposh was created at a time when it was generally accepted that to make good games one had to work abroad in a large company.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.makorrishon.co.il/nrg/online/10/ART/757/903.html|title=The Israeli Who Will Fly Harry Potter|last=Rivlin|first=Jesse|date=July 20, 2004|website=Makorrishon|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video game developer Adiel Gur thinks that Guillotine's did not have many contemporaries because of a lack of interest from high-tech companies to make games, a belief from producers that the sector is unprofitable, a lack of resources and tools for developers to make professional games, and the difficulty in amassing a team of workers from different fields (graphic artists, programmers, scriptwriters etc.).&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;  Ynet wrote that considering the number of Israelis studying computer science and the reputation of the country as a hub for high-tech entrepreneurs, it was surprising "how much an Israeli gaming industry does not exist", describing it as a "local vacuum".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Roy explained that in his opinion: "People who have the ability to develop computer games prefer to develop navigation applications and worm software that will sabotage the reactor in Iran".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In one case, the developers of Ballerium (2001) had to first present a comprehensive business plan in order to lure potential investors.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In 2001, Ynet wrote that it was difficult to name Israeli games that were not children's edutainment, and though able to recall some popular titles, with exception to ''Jane's IAF: Israeli Air Force'' called them "negligible in terms of scope and technicality" and non-competitive in the global market.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-709312,00.html|title=Game Made in Israel|last=Yogev|first=Udi|date=May 2, 2001|website=Ynet|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the site asserted that until recently, apart from children's edutainment developer [[:he:קומפדיה|Compedia]] and the Piposh series, there was no video gaming industry in Israel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3527394,00.html|title=Patriotic games|last=Lilien|first=Niv|date=April 4, 2008|work=Ynet|access-date=May 26, 2018|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; though expressed hope that the action game ''Rising Eagle'' would change that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3503959,00.html|title=Rising Eagle review: An Israeli Game|last=Roitblatt|first=Avishay|date=February 7, 2008|work=Ynet|access-date=May 26, 2018|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in 2008 Eser wrote: "It's not that I think there is no future for the Israeli computer games industry, and that there is no need to nurture it".&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== Critical reception ==
The games became a cult hit in Israel, known for their unique humor, original characters and a satirical look at Israeli society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://10tv.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=554015|title=Free Piposh|last=Jnana|first=|date=May 13, 2008|website=Eser|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronen is notable for being one of a few Israelis who have managed to develop a computer game within the country and distribute it in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3164686,00.html|title=Israel's first school for game developers was launched|last=Azar|first=Lihi|date=November 6, 2005|website=Ynet|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Timeout'', the games are hilarious and brave.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''Eser'' felt that Piposh was a "semi-decent adventure game".&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Bikorate felt the title had a "fascinating plot and humor ahead of its time".&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sites.google.com/site/bikorate/mishakim|title=Video Games|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Bikorate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student newsletter Factor thought the game was "more funny, more ingenious, and generally more universal" than ''In the Interest of Ratings'' had been a year earlier, and felt the two games were "exemplary examples of Israeli creativity".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 2001, ''Ynet'' asserted that the few games of Israeli origin such as Piposh were "quite negligible in terms of scope and technicality", and were "not close to being competitive in the global market"&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;, however in 2003 the site saw the series as a source of Israeli pride.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The site would later come to feel that the series offered some of the most "bizarre, funny and hallucinatory quests" to come out of gaming, noting that the first title is widely regarded as a cult game, and that many peculiar moments from the series are etched into the minds of players.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4368049,00.html|title=Blue and white gaming: From Xonix to Blue Star|last=Frost|first=Tal|date=April 16, 2013|work=Ynet|access-date=May 26, 2018|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bikorate thought Piposh 2 surprised with its "witty and satirical jokes about Israeli society".&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The Hebrew site ''Eser,'' despite having sympathy for Israeli game developers, who are "forced to work in almost impossible conditions" when compared to their American and European colleagues, gave Piposh 3D a scathing review; while calling its premise amusing, and noting that the patient ''Piposh'' fanbase would overlook its inferior graphics the site felt the game was very bad, likening it to a "singer singing without makeup".&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.10.tv/online/57155|title=Piposh: The Revolution|last=Zeerman|first=Idan|date=June 23, 2008|website=Eser|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://10tv.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=561139|title=Piposh: The Revolution|last=Zeerman|first=Idan|date=February 7, 2008|website=Eser|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ynet'' criticised 3D's graphics and interface, though noted its humour and charm might make up for the experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-2615517,00.html|title=Piposh 3D: A matter of taste|last=Reshef|first=Noam|date=May 3, 2011|work=Ynet|access-date=May 26, 2018|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben-Ari feels a sense of patriotism toward the game as a piece of video gaming software that is proudly and unabashedly Israeli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oldschool.org.il/videos/%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A9-%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A8-%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%A2%D7%9D-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A4%D7%AA%D7%97%D7%99%D7%9D/|title=Search: Coverage and interview with developers|last=Ben-Avi|first=Raphael|date=February 25, 2016|website=Oldschool|language=he-IL|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sport5'' listed the game in their article ''There is honor: the greatest Israeli computer games ever'', rating it 10/10 and praising its unique crazy and sharp sense of creativity and humour, as well as for sparking one of the "most cohesive computer game communities ever in the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sport5.co.il/articles.aspx?FolderID=7901&amp;docID=278533&amp;lang=HE|title=There is honor: the greatest Israeli computer games ever|last=Ben-Yishai|first=Matan|date=April 19, 2018|website=Sport5.co.il|language=HE|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Haaretz'' deemed it ultimately a failed initiative to establish the Israeli video gaming industry, despite its significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1105033|title=Looking for the Israeli Pacman|last=Grimelnad|first=Gia|date=March 14, 2006|work=Haaretz|access-date=May 26, 2018|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factor thought the series attempt to enter the 3D market was an "utter failure".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Even though Walla thought Piposh 3D was a bad game, it thought the game looked like a masterpiece in comparison with ''Dangerous Vaults'', a Lara Croft parody that forces players to have sex with animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tech.walla.co.il/item/782874|title=Sex with Animals|last=Moshe|first=Nimrod Ben|date=September 20, 2005|work=Walla|access-date=May 26, 2018|language=he-IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vgames deemed the series "the most daring attempt to create computer games for Israeli audiences only".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615035703/http://www.vgames.co.il/news_article.aspx?NewsID=14297|title=Special for Independence Day: Free Piposh!|last=Beirav|first=Yuval|date=June 15, 2008|website=Vgames|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When news of a fan-made Piposh 2.5 was brought to Nana 10, the site made an emotional appeal to its readers, hoping to attract  anyone who could "help this promising project take shape", while hoping it would be the first of many.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Meanwhile, 2all.co.il wished the developers success.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Noting a recent campaign to name a road in Israel "Lara Croft street", Nana 10 hoped that soon there would be a "Piposh street" to honour the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.10.tv/online/40550|title=On Lara Croft Street you take a right ...|last=David|first=Noa|date=August 3, 2009|website=Nana 10|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper believed Piposh to the possibly the most successful and profitable Israeli computer gaming project, deeming Guillotine a champion of the local industry.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Makorrishon deemed Guillotine a "stubborn pioneer" due to persisting with making a game in Israel, though noted that despite their bravery, the company did close down a mere 6 years later.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Looking back at the games in 2008, Ronen was impressed at how the humour held up, and noted ultimately that Piposh is "not a game of technology, but of people, behavior and relationships".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19790">'''Psychoacoustics''' is the scientific study of [[sound]] [[perception]] and audiology – how humans perceive various sounds. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the [[psychological]] and [[physiological]] responses associated with sound (including [[noise]], [[speech]] and [[music]]). It can be further categorized as a branch of [[psychophysics]]. Psychoacoustics received its name from a field within psychology—i.e., recognition science—which deals with all kinds of human perceptions. It is an interdisciplinary field of many areas, including psychology, acoustics, electronic engineering, physics, biology, physiology, and computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballou|first1=G|title=Handbook for Sound Engineers|date=2008|publisher=Burlington: Focal Press|page=43|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Hearing is not a purely mechanical phenomenon of [[wave propagation]], but is also a sensory and perceptual event; in other words, when a person hears something, that something arrives at the [[ear]] as a mechanical sound wave traveling through the air, but within the ear it is transformed into neural [[action potentials]]. The outer hair cells (OHC) of a mammalian [[cochlea]] give rise to an enhanced sensitivity and better{{clarify|date=May 2018}} frequency resolution of the mechanical response of the cochlear partition. These nerve pulses then travel to the brain where they are perceived. Hence, in many problems in acoustics, such as for [[Auditory system|audio processing]], it is advantageous to take into account not just the mechanics of the environment, but also the fact that both the ear and the brain are involved in a person’s listening experience.

The [[inner ear]], for example, does significant [[signal processing]] in converting sound [[waveform]]s into neural stimuli, so certain differences between waveforms may be imperceptible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Sense of Hearing | author = Christopher J. Plack | publisher = Routledge | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-8058-4884-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DoGzm3soUoMC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=ear+hearing+cochlea++inauthor:plack }}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Data compression]] techniques, such as [[MP3]], make use of this fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Sound Blaster Live! Book |author1=Lars Ahlzen |author2=Clarence Song | publisher = No Starch Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-1-886411-73-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tKO-truWww8C&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=mp3++imperceptible+ear }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ear has a nonlinear response to sounds of different intensity levels; this nonlinear response is called [[loudness]]. [[Telephone network]]s and audio [[noise reduction]] systems make use of this fact by nonlinearly compressing data samples before transmission, and then expanding them for playback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Modern dictionary of electronics | author = Rudolf F. Graf | publisher = Newnes | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-7506-9866-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=o2I1JWPpdusC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=compression+expansion+noise-reduction+telephone }}&lt;/ref&gt;    Another effect of the ear's nonlinear response is that sounds that are close in frequency produce phantom beat notes, or [[intermodulation]] distortion products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Handbook of Clinical Audiology |author1=Jack Katz |author2=Robert F. Burkard |author3=Larry Medwetsky  |last-author-amp=yes | publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-683-30765-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Aj6nVIegE6AC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=beat+distortion++ear }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "psychoacoustics" also arises in discussions about cognitive psychology and the effects that personal expectations, prejudices, and predispositions may have on listeners' relative evaluations and comparisons of sonic aesthetics and acuity and on listeners' varying determinations about the relative qualities of various musical instruments and performers. The expression that one "hears what one wants (or expects) to hear" may pertain in such discussions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The human ear can nominally hear sounds in the range {{nowrap|20 [[Hertz|Hz]]}} {{nowrap|(0.02 kHz)}} to {{nowrap|20,000 Hz}} {{nowrap|(20 kHz).}}  The upper limit tends to decrease with age; most adults are unable to hear above 16&amp;nbsp;kHz. The lowest frequency that has been identified as a musical tone is 12&amp;nbsp;Hz under ideal laboratory conditions.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite book |title=Music, Physics and Engineering |last=Olson |first=Harry F. |authorlink=Harry F. Olson |year= 1967|publisher=Dover Publications |pages=248–251 |isbn=978-0-486-21769-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUDTFBbb7jAC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tones between 4 and 16&amp;nbsp;Hz can be perceived via the body's [[sense of touch]].

Frequency resolution of the ear is 3.6&amp;nbsp;Hz within the octave of {{nowrap|1000 – 2000 Hz.}}  That is, changes in pitch larger than 3.6&amp;nbsp;Hz can be perceived in a clinical setting.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite book |title=Music, Physics and Engineering |last=Olson |first=Harry F. |authorlink=Harry F. Olson |year= 1967|publisher=Dover Publications |pages=248–251 |isbn=978-0-486-21769-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUDTFBbb7jAC }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even smaller pitch differences can be perceived through other means. For example, the interference of two pitches can often be heard as a repetitive variation in volume of the tone. This amplitude modulation occurs with a frequency equal to the difference in frequencies of the two tones and is known as [[beat (acoustics)|beating]].

The [[semitone]] scale used in Western musical notation is not a linear frequency scale but [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]. Other scales have been derived directly from experiments on human hearing perception, such as the [[mel scale]] and [[Bark scale]] (these are used in studying perception, but not usually in musical composition), and these are approximately logarithmic in frequency at the high-frequency end, but nearly linear at the low-frequency end.

The intensity range of audible sounds is enormous. Human ear drums are sensitive to variations in the sound pressure, and can detect pressure changes from as small as a few [[micropascal]]s (µPa) to greater than {{nowrap|100 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]].}}  For this reason, [[sound pressure|sound pressure level]] is also measured logarithmically, with all pressures referenced to {{nowrap|20 [[Pascal (unit)|µPa]]}} (or 1.97385&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]]). The lower limit of audibility is therefore defined as {{nowrap|0 [[decibel|dB]],}} but the upper limit is not as clearly defined. The upper limit is more a question of the limit where the ear will be physically harmed or with the potential to cause [[noise-induced hearing loss]].

A more rigorous exploration of the lower limits of audibility determines that the minimum threshold at which a sound can be heard is frequency dependent.  By measuring this minimum intensity for testing tones of various frequencies, a frequency dependent [[absolute threshold of hearing]] (ATH) curve may be derived.  Typically, the ear shows a peak of sensitivity (i.e., its lowest ATH) between {{nowrap|1–5 kHz,}} though the threshold changes with age, with older ears showing decreased sensitivity above 2&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=Fastl&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychoacoustics: Facts and Models |last=Fastl |first=Hugo | last2=Zwicker| first2=Eberhard |year= 2006 |publisher=Springer |pages=21–22 |isbn=978-3-540-23159-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ATH is the lowest of the [[equal-loudness contour]]s. Equal-loudness contours indicate the sound pressure level (dB SPL), over the range of audible frequencies, that are perceived as being of equal loudness.  Equal-loudness contours were first measured by Fletcher and Munson at [[Bell Labs]] in 1933 using pure tones reproduced via headphones, and the data they collected are called [[Fletcher–Munson curves]].  Because subjective loudness was difficult to measure, the Fletcher–Munson curves were averaged over many subjects.

Robinson and Dadson refined the process in 1956 to obtain a new set of equal-loudness curves for a frontal sound source measured in an [[anechoic chamber]]. The Robinson-Dadson curves were standardized as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 226 in 1986. In 2003, {{nowrap|ISO 226}} was revised as [[equal-loudness contour]] using data collected from 12 international studies.

==Sound localization==
{{Main|Sound localization}}

[[Sound localization]] is the process of determining the location of a sound source. The brain utilizes subtle differences in loudness, tone and timing between the two ears to allow us to localize sound sources.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, Daniel M. Understanding Audio: Getting the Most out of Your Project or Professional Recording Studio. Boston, MA: Berklee, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Localization can be described in terms of three-dimensional position: the [[azimuth]] or horizontal angle, the [[zenith]] or vertical angle, and the distance (for static sounds) or velocity (for moving sounds).&lt;ref name="Roads"&gt;Roads, Curtis. The Computer Music Tutorial. Cambridge, MA: MIT, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans, as most [[tetrapoda|four-legged animals]], are adept at detecting direction in the horizontal, but less so in the vertical due to the ears being placed symmetrically. Some species of [[owls]] have their ears placed asymmetrically, and can detect sound in all three planes, an adaption to hunt small mammals in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, D.P. (2007): Owl ears and hearing. Owl Pages [Online]. Available: http://www.owlpages.com/articles.php?section=Owl+Physiology&amp;title=Hearing [2011, April 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Masking effects ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
{{Main|Auditory masking}}

[[File:Audio Mask Graph.png|thumb|Audio masking graph]]Suppose a listener cannot hear a given acoustical signal under silent condition. When a signal is playing while another sound is being played (a masker) the signal has to be stronger for the listener to hear it. The masker does not need to have the frequency components of the original signal for masking to happen. A masked signal can be heard even though it is weaker than the masker. Masking happens when a signal and a masker are played together. It also happens when a masker starts after a signal stops playing. The effects of backward masking is weaker than forward masking. The masking effect has been widely used in psychoacoustical research. With masking you can change the levels of the masker and measure the threshold, then create a diagram of a psychophysical tuning curve that will reveal similar features. Masking effects are also used for audio encoding. The masking effect is used in lossy encoders. It can eliminate some of the weaker sounds, so the listener can not hear the difference. This technique has been used in MP3's.

== Missing fundamental ==
{{Main|Missing fundamental}}

When presented with a [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] of frequencies in the relationship 2''f'', 3''f'', 4''f'', 5''f'', etc. (where ''f'' is a specific frequency), humans tend to perceive that the pitch is ''f''.

== Software ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]] --&gt;
[[File:Acustic Block Diagram.svg|thumb|Perceptual audio coding uses psychoacoustics-based algorithms.]]

The psychoacoustic model provides for high quality [[lossy data compression|lossy signal compression]] by describing which parts of a given digital audio signal can be removed (or aggressively compressed) safely—that is, without significant losses in the (consciously) perceived quality of the sound.

It can explain how a sharp clap of the hands might seem painfully loud in a quiet library, but is hardly noticeable after a car backfires on a busy, urban street.  This provides great benefit to the overall compression ratio, and psychoacoustic analysis routinely leads to compressed music files that are 1/10th to 1/12th the size of high quality masters, but with discernibly less proportional quality loss. Such compression is a feature of nearly all modern lossy audio compression formats. Some of these formats include [[Dolby Digital]] (AC-3), [[MP3]], [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]], [[Ogg Vorbis]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]], [[MPEG-1 Layer II]] (used for [[digital audio broadcasting]] in several countries) and [[ATRAC]], the compression used in [[MiniDisc]] and some [[Walkman]] models.

Psychoacoustics is based heavily on [[human anatomy]], especially the ear's limitations in perceiving sound as outlined previously.  To summarize, these limitations are:

*[[High frequency limit]]
*[[Absolute threshold of hearing]]
*[[Temporal masking]]
*[[Simultaneous masking]]

Given that the ear will not be at peak perceptive capacity when dealing with these limitations, a compression algorithm can assign a lower priority to sounds outside the range of human hearing.  By carefully shifting bits away from the unimportant components and toward the important ones, the algorithm ensures that the sounds a listener is most likely to perceive are of the highest quality.

== Music ==
Psychoacoustics includes topics and studies that are relevant to [[music psychology]] and [[music therapy]]. Theorists such as [[Benjamin Boretz]] consider some of the results of psychoacoustics to be meaningful only in a musical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sterne|first=Jonathan|title=The Audible Past: Cultural Origins of Sound Reproduction|year=2003|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irv Teibel]]'s ''[[Environments (album series)|Environments series]]'' LPs (1969–79) are an early example of commercially available sounds released expressly for enhancing psychological abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cummings|first1=Jim|title=Irv Teibel died this week: Creator of 1970s "Environments" LPs|url=http://earthear.com/blog/archives/198|website=Earth Ear|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applied psychoacoustics ==
[[File:Psychoacoustic Model.svg|thumb|Psychoacoustics Model]]

Psychoacoustics has long enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with [[computer science]], [[computer engineering]], and [[computer network]]ing. Internet pioneers [[J. C. R. Licklider]] and [[Robert Taylor (computer scientist)|Bob Taylor]] both completed graduate-level work in psychoacoustics, while [[BBN Technologies]] originally specialized in consulting on acoustics issues before it began building the first [[Packet-switching|packet-switched]] computer networks.

Licklider wrote a paper entitled "A duplex theory of pitch perception".&lt;ref name="Raychel Rappold"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cs.rit.edu/~rpretc/imm/project1/biography.html|first = Raychel |last=Rappold|title=Biography|publisher=Rochester University|accessdate=2015-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoacoustics is applied within many fields from software development, where developers map proven and experimental mathematical patterns; in digital signal processing, where many audio compression codecs such as [[MP3]] and [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] use a psychoacoustic model to increase compression ratios; in the design of (high end) audio systems for accurate reproduction of music in theatres and homes; as well as defense systems where scientists have experimented with limited success in creating new acoustic weapons, which emit frequencies that may impair, harm, or kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2002/March/Pages/Acoustic-Energy4112.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719122933/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2002/March/Pages/Acoustic-Energy4112.aspx |archivedate=2010-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also applied today within music, where musicians and artists continue to create new auditory experiences by masking unwanted frequencies of instruments, causing other frequencies to be enhanced. Yet another application is in the design of small or lower-quality loudspeakers, which can use the phenomenon of [[missing fundamental]]s to give the effect of bass notes at lower frequencies than the loudspeakers are physically able to produce (see references).

A '''queen bee''' is the leader of a [[female]] group, such as a [[clique]]. The term has been applied in several social settings.

==Businesses==
In a business environment, a "queen bee" may refer to a woman in upper management who advanced in the ranks without any help of any type of [[affirmative action]] programs. Many of those executive women tend to be politically [[Conservatism|conservative]] and they choose not to publicly identify with [[feminism]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} They often see other, usually younger, women as competitors and will refuse to help them advance within a company, preferring to mentor a male over a female employee. Some such "queen bees" may actively take steps to hinder another woman's advancement as they are seen as direct competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1265356.ece|title=Article|publisher=Timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=2014-02-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604213932/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1265356.ece|archive-date=2011-06-04|dead-url=no|df=}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such tactics are sometimes referred to as [[heterophily]] (in the sense of positive preference and favoritism for opposite-sex colleagues) or the [[queen bee syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cooper |first=Virginia W. |year=1997 |title=Homophily or the Queen Bee Syndrome: Female Evaluation of Female Leadership |journal=[[Small Group Research]] |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=483–499 |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |doi=10.1177/1046496497284001 |url=http://sgr.sagepub.com/content/28/4/483|accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "loophole woman", coined by [[Caroline Bird (American author)|Caroline Bird]] in her book ''Born Female: The High Cost of Keeping Women Down'' (1968), has a similar meaning. Marie Mullaney defines the loophole woman as one who, "successful in a predominantly male field like law, business or medicine, is opposed to other women's attaining similar levels of success. Such success, if attained by women on a large scale, would detract from, if not substantially reduce, her own status and importance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mullaney|first1=Marie|title=Gender and the Socialist Revolutionary Role|journal=Historical Reflections|date=1984|volume=11|issue=2|page=147|jstor=41298827}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The term "[[honorary male]]" is related, but does not imply opposition to other women's success).

==Schools==
A queen bee in a school setting is sometimes referred to as a '''school diva''' or '''school princess'''. These queen bees are often [[stereotype]]d in the media as being [[Physical attractiveness|beautiful]], [[charisma]]tic, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], and [[wealth]]y, holding positions of high [[social status]], such as being [[Cheerleading|head cheerleader]] (or being the [[Captain (sports)|captain]] of some other, usually an all-girl, sports team), the [[Homecoming]] or [[Prom|Prom Queen]] (or both).&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, K. (2003) ''The Girl's Got Bite: The Original Unauthorized Guide to Buffy's World''. Macmillan. p 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of queen bees is common in [[finishing school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Raines, J.M. (2003) ''Beautylicious!: The Black Girl's Guide to the Fabulous Life.'' Harlem Moon Publishers. p 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen bees may wield substantial influence and power over their cliques, and are considered [[role model]]s by clique members and outsiders. Her actions are closely followed and imitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ivillage.com/girls-cliques-what-role-does-your-daughter-play/6-a-144522 |title=Girls' Cliques: What Role Does Your Daughter Play? |last=Wiseman |first=Rosalind |authorlink=Rosalind Wiseman |date=9 December 2011 |publisher=[[iVillage]] |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sussana Stern identifies the following qualities as characteristic of queen bees:&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Sussana (2001) Sexual Selves on the World Wide Web: Adolescent Girls' Home Pages as Sites for Sexual Self-Expression; Sexual Teens, Sexual Media, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt;

*Having an overly-heightened [[self-esteem]], which may lead to [[Hubris|arrogance]] 
*Being overly-[[aggression|aggressive]], [[selfish]], [[psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and strong-willed
*Behaving as a [[bullying|bully]] or [[psychopathy#sociopathy|sociopath]]
*Being [[wealth]]y and/or "[[spoiled child|spoiled]]"
*Being [[attractiveness|pretty]], [[popularity|popular]], [[Aptitude|talented]], rich, or [[social privilege|privilege]]d
*Being envied/hated/admired by [[Peer group|peers]] (mainly female peers)

Fictional portrayals of queen bees in schools include the films ''[[Heathers]]'' and ''[[Mean Girls]]''. The latter was partially adapted from the nonfiction book ''[[Queen Bees and Wannabes]]''. The television series ''[[Gossip Girl]]'' is highlighted for its portrayal of [[Blair Waldorf]] as a queen bee, as she has a league of minions for friends and is frequently referred as 'Queen B'
by her peers. Another television series ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'' is also highlighted for its portrayal of [[Alison DiLaurentis]] as queen bee, as she has a clique, seems to be bossy and mean to people who are not her friends, and everyone treats her as a Queen. She is sometimes referred as 'Queen Ali'. [[Quinn Fabray]] from ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' is also described as "queen bee" due to her being rich, popular, beautiful and head cheerleader.

'''Set-jetting''' is the trend of traveling to destinations that are first seen in movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cosypursuits.com/2017/06/17/set-jetting-location-vacations-book-tourism-detective-travel/|title=Set Jetting, Location Vacations, Book Tourism &amp; Detective Travel|date=2017-06-17|website=Cosy Pursuits|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also referred to as a "Location Vacation". Touring [[London]] in a high-speed boat like [[James Bond]], or visiting the stately homes that are seen in the [[Jane Austen in popular culture|Jane Austen films]] are good examples. 

The term was first coined in the US press in the ''[[New York Post]]'' by journalist [[Gretchen Kelly]].&lt;ref name="kelly"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/set_jetting_2IA9GEMZ2VSWSoDH5qdZ9M|title=Set Jetting|author=Gretchen Kelly|publisher=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=2009-11-05 | date=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis about the use of Geospatial technologies in setjetting was proposed by [[Thierry Joliveau]] in [[The Cartographic Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Connecting Real and Imaginary Places through Geospatial Technologies: Examples from Set-jetting and Art-oriented Tourism|url = http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/000870409X415570|journal = The Cartographic Journal|date = 2009-02-01|issn = 0008-7041|pages = 36–45|volume = 46|issue = 1|doi = 10.1179/000870409X415570|first = Thierry|last = Joliveau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations, convention and tourism boards are exploiting the trend, creating their own set-jetting travel maps, like the ''[[Elizabeth: The Golden Age]]'' movie map published by VisitBritain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitbritain.us/campaigns/film/index.aspx?url=/movies|title=Movie Map|work=visitbritain.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617071016/http://www.visitbritain.us/campaigns/film/index.aspx?url=%2Fmovies|archivedate=17 June 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090205150218/http://www.visitbritain.us/Images/Golden%20Age%20Map%20FINAL_tcm20-114120.pdf Elizabeth the Golden Age].

'''Sotades''' ({{lang-el|Σωτάδης}}; 3rd century BC) was an [[Ancient Greek literature#Hellenistic poetry|Ancient Greek poet]].

==Biography==
Sotades was born in [[Maroneia]],&lt;ref&gt;Suda σ 871&lt;/ref&gt; either the one in [[Thrace]], or in [[Crete]]. He lived in [[History of Alexandria#Ptolemaic era|Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] (285-246 BC). [[Alexandrian school|The city was at that time]] a remarkable center of learning, with a great deal of artistic and literary activity, including epic poetry and the [[Library of Alexandria|Great Library]]. Only a few genuine fragments of his work have been preserved; those in [[Stobaeus]] are generally considered spurious. [[Ennius]] translated some poems of this kind, included in his book of satires under the name of Sola. He had a son named [[Apollonius (son of Sotades)|Apollonius]].

Sotades was the chief representative of the writers of [[obscenity|obscene]] and even [[pederasty|pederastic]] [[satire|satirical]] [[poetry|poems]], called '''Kinaidoi''' ({{lang-grc|Κίναιδοι}}), composed in the [[Ionic Greek|Ionic dialect]] and in the metre named after him. The sotadic metre or sotadic verse, which has been classified by ancient and modern scholars as a form of [[ionic metre]], is one that reads backwards and forwards the same, as “llewd did I live, and evil I did dwell.”  These verses have also been called [[palindrome|palindromic]]. Sotades was also the author of some of the first recorded palindromes, and many credit him with the invention of that particular genre of composition.

One of his poems attacked [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]]'s [[Incest#Antiquity|marriage to his own sister]] [[Arsinoe II of Egypt|Arsinoe]], from which came the infamous line: "You're sticking your prick in an unholy hole."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''On the Education of Children'', 11a; Athenaeus, xiv. 621a. Translation from Graham Shipley, ''The Greek World After Alexander, 323-30 B.C.'', page 185. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; For this, Sotades was imprisoned, but he escaped to the island of Caunus, where he was afterwards captured by [[Patroclus (admiral)|Patroclus, Ptolemy's admiral]], shut up in a leaden chest, and thrown into the sea. 

British [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] and explorer Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]] (1821-1890) hypothesised the existence of a "[[Sotadic zone]]". He asserted that there exists a geographic zone in which pederasty, i.e. romantic-sexual intimacy between a boy and a man, is prevalent and celebrated among the indigenous inhabitants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waitt|first=Gordon|author2=Kevin Markwell |title=The Lure of the "Sotadic Zone"’|journal=Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide|year=2008|volume=15|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named it after Sotades.

[[Spain]] took part in the first [[Eurovision Dance Contest]] in 2007. [[Amagoya Benlloch]] and [[Abraham Martinez]] were chosen to represent the country in the program ''¡Mira Quién Baila a Eurovisión!'' (a special edition of [[¡Mira quién baila!|the Spanish version]] of [[Dancing with the Stars]]).  The dances they performed at the contest were [[cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha-Cha-Cha]] and [[Paso Doble]].  Spain came tenth after receiving 38 points from 7 countries.

Spanish broadcaster TVE announced its withdrawal from [[Eurovision Dance Contest 2008]] on August 20, 2008, just days before the contest took place. In July TVE had conducted national selection show ''[[Quiero Bailar|¡Quiero Bailar!]]'' and named singer [[Rosa López]] and dancer Nieto as their representatives in the contest. According to the draw they were supposed to be 15th couple to perform.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esckaz.com/edc/2008/spa.htm|title=Spain at Eurovision Dance Contest 2008|publisher=ESCKaz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Third Eurovision Dance Contest]] was cancelled indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=What caused the death of the Eurovision Dance Contest?|url=http://eurovoix.com/2011/05/29/what-caused-the-death-of-the-eurovision-dance-contest-p1/|website=Eurovoix.xom|publisher=Eurovoix.com|accessdate=22 June 2014|date=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition''''' is an update to ''[[Super Street Fighter IV]]'', released in 2011 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]] and in 2017 the [[Xbox 360]] version became backward compatible on the [[Xbox One]]. This version of the game aims at bringing the improvements from the arcade version of ''Super Street Fighter IV'' to home systems. Besides numerous balance changes, ''SSFIV:AE'' introduces new characters [[Yun and Yang]], and makes previously hidden characters Evil Ryu and Oni playable out of the box.
The game has sold 400,000 units worldwide as of December 2011, and 1.1 million by September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2011/2nd/explanation_2011_2nd_03.pdf|title=2011 2nd Quarter Finalcial Results|date=2011-03-31|accessdate=2011-10-28|publisher=[[Capcom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, before the announcement of ''Ultra Street Fighter IV'', Capcom community manager Seth Killian had announced that the ''Arcade Edition'' would be the final version of the ''Street Fighter IV'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-04-12-arcade-edition-ends-street-fighter-iv|title=Arcade Edition ends Street Fighter IV|publisher=Eurogamer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
{{expand section|date=July 2013}}
On April 4, 2010, an [[Arcade game|arcade]] version of ''Super Street Fighter IV'' was confirmed by producer Yoshinori Ono during the Japanese ''Street Fighter IV'' finals.&lt;ref name=arcade&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shoryuken.com/content.php?r=530-Arcade-LIVES-Super-Street-Fighter-4-Confirmed|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407054732/http://www.shoryuken.com/content.php?r=530-Arcade-LIVES-Super-Street-Fighter-4-Confirmed|archivedate=2010-04-07|work=Shoryuken.com|title=Arcade LIVES!

A '''toy library''' lends or hires out toys, puzzles, and games, functioning either as a rental shop or a form of [[family resource program]]. Toy libraries offer play sessions for families and a wide range of toys appropriate for children at different stages in their development. Toy libraries provide children with new toys every week or two, saving parents money and keeping children from getting bored. Popular in the French-speaking world, toy libraries are called [[:fr:ludothèque|ludothèques]].

== History ==
Toy libraries have existed since at least 1935, with the establishment of one in Los Angeles. The idea re-emerged and gained popularity in the United States in the 60s and 70s with the passage of [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] and other legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Moore, Julia E. |year=1995 |publisher=Kent State University master's thesis |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED390414&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED390414|accessdate=23 May 2010|title=A History of Toy Lending Libraries in the United States Since 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Children on a trampoline in Canada - 2018 (28749200128).jpg|thumb|Children bouncing on a trampoline]]
A '''trampoline''' is a device consisting of a piece of taut, strong [[fabric]] stretched between a [[steel]] frame using many coiled [[spring (device)|springs]]. People bounce on trampolines for [[recreational]] and competitive purposes.

The fabric that users bounce on (commonly known as the "bounce mat" or "trampoline bed") is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs that connect it to the frame, which store [[potential energy]].

==History==

=== Early trampoline-like devices ===
&lt;!--[[Blanket toss]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
[[File:Inuitene morer seg med såkalt skinndans, 1922-1923 (12114498483).jpg|thumb|Inuit blanket toss in Wainwright, Alaska (1922-1923) during [[Maud (ship)|Amundsen's Maud Expedition]]]]
[[File:Nalukataq Blanket Toss Barrow.jpg|thumb|Iñupiat blanket toss during the [[Nalukataq]] festival in Barrow, Alaska (2006)]]

A game similar to trampolining was developed by the [[Inuit]], who would toss blanket dancers into the air on a walrus skin one at a time (see [[Nalukataq]]) during a spring celebration of whale harvest. There is also some evidence of people in [[Europe]] having been tossed into the air by a number of people holding a blanket. Mak in the [[Wakefield]] ''[[Second Shepherds' Play]]'' and [[Sancho Panza]] in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' are both subjected to blanketing – however, these are clearly non-voluntary, non-recreational instances of quasi-judicial, mob-administered punishment. The trampoline-like [[life net]]s once used by firefighters to catch people jumping out of burning buildings were invented in 1887.

The 19th-century poster for [[Pablo Fanque]]'s Circus Royal refers to performance on trampoline. The device is thought to have been more like a springboard than the fabric-and-coiled-springs apparatus presently in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sideshowworld.com/a/at/atskite.html|title=Sideshow World, Sideshow Performers from around the world.|author=|date=|website=www.sideshowworld.com|accessdate=May 3, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193734/http://www.sideshowworld.com/a/at/atskite.html|archivedate=March 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These may not be the true antecedents of the modern sport of trampolining, but indicate that the concept of bouncing off a fabric surface has been around for some time. In the early years of the 20th century, some acrobats used a "bouncing bed" on the stage to amuse audiences. The bouncing bed was, a form of small trampoline covered by bedclothes, on which acrobats performed mostly [[comedy]] routines.

According to [[Circus (performing art)|circus]] folklore, the trampoline was supposedly first developed by an artiste named du Trampolin, who saw the possibility of using the trapeze safety net as a form of propulsion and landing device and experimented with different systems of suspension, eventually reducing the net to a practical size for separate performance. While trampoline-like devices were used for shows and in the circus, the story of du Trampolin is almost certainly apocryphal. No documentary evidence has been found to support it.

===First modern trampolines===
The first modern trampoline was built by [[George Nissen]] and [[Larry Griswold]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121006232916/http://www.wvtc.co.uk/history3.htm WestView Trampoline Community site - Trampoline History p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; Nissen was a [[gymnastics]] and [[Diving (sport)|diving]] competitor and Griswold was a [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbler]] on the gymnastics team, both at the [[University of Iowa]], United States. They had observed [[trapeze]] artists using a tight net to add entertainment value to their performance and experimented by stretching a piece of canvas, in which they had inserted grommets along each side, to an angle iron frame by means of coiled springs. It was initially used to train tumblers but soon became popular in its own right. Nissen explained that the name came from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''trampolín'', meaning a [[springboard|diving board]]. Nissen had heard the word on a demonstration tour in [[Mexico]] in the late 1930s and decided to use an anglicized form as the trademark for the apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/nissen.html|title=Inventor of the Week Archive - George Nissen|accessdate=April 13, 2007|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=March 2004|work=|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT School of Engineering|pages=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630114013/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/nissen.html|archivedate=June 30, 2007|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, Griswold and Nissen created the Griswold-Nissen Trampoline &amp; Tumbling Company, and began making trampolines commercially in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]].

The generic term for the trademarked trampoline was a ''rebound tumbler''&lt;ref name=rebound_tumbler&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s85tbw_N6hcC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=%22rebound+tumbler%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ECkPR651id&amp;sig=NKWvO7nxkFAT62GJ6e3WMKFLnvk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result|title=A Sportswriter's Life: From the Desk of a New York Times Reporter|first=Gerald|last=Eskenazi|date=May 3, 2018|publisher=University of Missouri Press|accessdate=May 3, 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sport began as ''rebound tumbling''. It has since lost its trademark and has become a [[List of generic and genericized trademarks|generic trademark]].

Early in their development Nissen anticipated trampolines being used in a number of recreational areas, including those involving more than one participant on the same trampoline. One such game was Spaceball{{mdash}}a game of two teams of two on a single trampoline with specially constructed end "walls" and a middle "wall" through which a ball could be propelled to hit a target on the other side's end wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.brentwoodtc.org/history.htm | title = Trampoline history | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100610013557/http://www.brentwoodtc.org/history.htm | archivedate = June 10, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use in flight and astronaut training====
During [[World War II]], the United States Navy Flight School developed the use of the trampoline in its training of pilots and navigators, giving them concentrated practice in spatial orientation that had not been possible before.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121006232916/http://www.wvtc.co.uk/history4.htm WestView Trampoline Community site - Trampoline History p.4]&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the development of the [[space flight]] programme again brought the trampoline into use to help train both American and Soviet [[astronaut]]s, giving them experience of variable body positions in flight.

====Competitive sports====
[[Image:Girls Synchro WAGC 2007.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|Girls competing in synchronised trampoline]]{{Main|Trampolining}}
The [[1964 Trampoline World Championships|first Trampoline World Championships]] were organised by [[Ted Blake]] of Nissen, and held in London in 1964. The first World Champions were both American, [[Dan Millman]] and [[Judy Wills Cline]].  Cline went on to dominate and become the most highly decorated trampoline champion of all time.

One of the earliest pioneers of trampoline as a competitive sport was [[Jeff Hennessy]], a coach at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]]. Hennessy also coached the United States trampoline team, producing more world champions than any other person. Among his world champions was his daughter, [[Leigh Hennessy]].  Both Jeff and Leigh Hennessy are in the [[USA Gymnastics]] Hall of Fame.

The competitive gymnastic sport of [[trampolining]] has been part of the [[Olympic Games]] since 2000. On a modern competitive trampoline, a skilled athlete can bounce to a height of up to {{convert|10|m|ft}}, performing multiple [[somersault]]s and twists. Trampolines also feature in the competitive sport of [[Slamball]], a variant of [[basketball]], and [[Bossaball]], a variant of [[volleyball]].

====Cross-training for other sports====
There are a number of other sports that use trampolines to help develop and hone [[acrobatic]] skills in training before they are used in the actual sporting venue. Examples can be found in [[Diving (sport)|diving]], [[gymnastics]], and [[freestyle skiing]]. One main advantage of trampolining as [[List of acrobatic activities|a training tool for other acrobatic sports]] is that it allows repetitive drill practice for acrobatic experience every two seconds or less, compared with many minutes with sports that involve hills, ramps or high platforms. In some situations it can also be safer compared to landings on the ground.

==Construction==
There are two generic types of trampoline, competitive and recreational.

===Competitive===
The frame of a competitive trampoline is made of steel and can be made to fold up for transportation to competition venues. The trampoline bed is rectangular {{convert|4.28|x|2.14|m|ftin}} in size fitted into the {{convert|5.05|x|2.91|m|ft|0}} frame
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://figdocs.sportcentric.net/external/serve.php?document=3792|title=Apparatus Norms|publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique]]|year=2011|format=PDF|accessdate=May 23, 2013}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
with around 110 steel springs (the actual number may vary by manufacturer). The bed is made of a strong fabric, although this is not itself elastic; the elasticity is provided only by the springs. The fabric can be woven from webbing, which is the most commonly used material. However, in the 2007 World Championships held in [[Quebec City]], a [[David Ross (trampolinist)|Ross]] bed (or two-string bed), woven from individual thin strings, was used. This type of bed gives a little extra height to the rebound.

===Recreational===
[[File:Bounce mat.png|thumb|Bounce mat]]

====Home trampolines====
Recreational trampolines for home use are less sturdily constructed than competitive ones and their springs are weaker. They may be of various shapes, though most are circular, octagonal or rectangular. The fabric is usually a waterproof [[canvas]] or woven [[polypropylene]] material.

As with competitive trampolines, recreational trampolines are usually made using coiled steel springs to provide the rebounding force, but [[Springfree Trampoline|spring-free trampolines]] also exist.

====Commercial trampoline parks====
[[File:House of Air The Matrix.jpg|thumb|right|House of Air Trampoline Park in San Francisco]]In 1959 and 1960 it became very popular to have outdoor commercial "jump centres" or "trampoline parks" in many places in North America where people could enjoy recreational trampolining. However, these tended to have a high accident rate, and the public's interest rapidly waned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121006232916/http://www.wvtc.co.uk/history19.htm WestView Trampoline Community site - Trampoline History p. 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, indoor commercial trampoline parks have made a comeback, with a number of franchises operating across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. ABC News has reported that in 2014 there were at least 345 trampoline parks operating in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/big-bounce-trampoline-parks-puts-safety-spotlight/story?id=30551552|title=Big Bounce in Trampoline Parks Puts Safety in Spotlight|first=A.

The following year, IATP estimated that 345 parks were open by the end of 2014, and that another 115 would open by the end of 2015 in North America. IATP also estimated that at the end of 2014 there were 40 parks outside of North America, and that by the end of 2015 there would be at least 100 indoor trampoline parks open internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indoortrampolineparks.org/assets/docs/playmeter%20sarris%20article.pdf|title=Indoor trampoline parks are 'springing' up everywhere!|format=PDF|last=Sarris|first=Tracy|date=April 1, 2014|website=Association of Indoor Trampoline Parks|access-date=March 28, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226092210/http://www.indoortrampolineparks.org/assets/docs/playmeter%20sarris%20article.pdf|archivedate=February 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indoortrampolineparks.org/assets/docs/play_meter_iatp_article_2015.pdf|title=Jump!

These commercial parks are located indoors, and have wall-to wall-trampolines to prevent people falling off the trampolines on to hard surfaces. Padded or spring walls protect people from impact injuries. Despite these precautions, there has been at least one death recorded due to a head-first landing at a trampoline park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/maureen-kerley-pushes-for-trampoline-park-regulations-following-2012-death-of-son-at-phoenixs-skypark-6663641 | title = Maureen Kerley Pushes for Trampoline-Park Regulations Following 2012 Death of Son at Phoenix's SkyPark | date = June 5, 2013 | publisher = Phoenix New Times | accessdate = June 15, 2016 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160811085942/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/maureen-kerley-pushes-for-trampoline-park-regulations-following-2012-death-of-son-at-phoenixs-skypark-6663641 | archivedate = August 11, 2016 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, [[New York Yankees]] pitcher [[Joba Chamberlain]] seriously injured his ankle while jumping at a commercial jump centre in [[Tampa]] with his son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/joba-a-pitcher-calm-911-tape-article-1.1051252 "Joba’s a pitcher of calm on 911 tape"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330005859/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/joba-a-pitcher-calm-911-tape-article-1.1051252 |date=March 30, 2012 }}, ''New York Daily News''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a man died in a British Columbia trampoline park, which prompted calls for more safety regulations for these popular activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/death-at-b-c-trampoline-park-prompts-call-for-safety-regulations-1.3776806|title=Death at B.C. trampoline park prompts call for safety regulations|author=|date=January 26, 2018|website=ctvnews.ca|accessdate=May 3, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406163419/https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/death-at-b-c-trampoline-park-prompts-call-for-safety-regulations-1.3776806|archivedate=April 6, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wall running===
[[File:WallRun1.jpg|thumb|Wall running]] Wall running is a sport where the participant uses a wall and platforms placed next to the trampoline bed to do tricks. The basic movement is a backdrop on the trampoline and then the feet touching the wall at the top of the bounce. From there, there is no limit to the acrobatic movements that are possible, similar to regular trampolining. The advantage is that twists and turns can be initiated more forcefully from a solid wall and that the vertical speed can be transferred to rotation in addition to forces from the legs or arms. Additionally, energy can be gained both from the bed at the bottom of the bounce, and from the wall at the top of the bounce.

==Safety==
[[Image:Trampoline with enclosure.jpg|right|thumb| With safety nets, the risk of falling off the trampoline is reduced.]]
Using a trampoline can be dangerous. Organized clubs and gyms usually have large safety end-decks with foam pads at each end, and spotters are placed alongside the trampoline to try to break the fall of any athlete who loses control and falls.  In 1999, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimated there were 100,000 hospital emergency room visits for trampoline injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trampolines|url=https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/pdfs/tramp00.pdf|publisher=[[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]]|format=PDF|date=September 2000|accessdate=February 6, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126081742/https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/pdfs/tramp00.pdf|archivedate=January 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the much larger numbers involved and lesser safety standards, the majority of injuries occur on privately owned home trampolines or in commercial trampoline facilities rather than organized gyms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/doctors-warn-of-trampoline-injury-risks-1.1250737 ''Doctors warn of trampoline injury risks''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809215640/http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/doctors-warn-of-trampoline-injury-risks-1.1250737 |date=August 9, 2016 }}, CBC News - Health, September 24, 2012, retrieved August 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Bouncing off a trampoline can result in a fall of {{convert|3|-|4|m|ft|0}} from the peak of a bounce to the ground or a fall into the suspension springs and frame. There has been an increase in the number of home trampolines in recent years and a corresponding increase in the number of injuries reported. Some medical organizations have suggested that the devices be banned from home use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/03/980303064046.htm|title=Study Of Trampoline-Related Injuries Calls For Ban On Devices|author=|date=|website=sciencedaily.com|accessdate=May 3, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095446/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/03/980303064046.htm|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pediatrics"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/4/774|title=Trampoline Safety in Childhood and Adolescence|first=Council on Sports Medicine And|last=Fitness|date=October 1, 2012|publisher=|journal=Pediatrics|volume=130|issue=4|pages=774–779|accessdate=May 3, 2018|via=pediatrics.aappublications.org|doi=10.1542/peds.2012-2082|pmid=23008455|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503102307/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/4/774|archivedate=May 3, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities recommend that only one person should be allowed to jump at a time to avoid collisions and people being catapulted in an unexpected direction or higher than they expect. One of the most common sources of injury is when multiple users are bouncing on the trampoline at one time. More often than not, this situation leads to users bouncing into one another and thus becoming injured; many suffer broken bones as a result of landing badly after knocking into another user.&lt;ref name="Pediatrics"/&gt;
[[File:Øvre Årdal 14 May 2015.jpg|thumbnail|left|A recreational trampoline with a safety net enclosure]]
Another of the most common sources of serious injury is an attempt to perform [[somersault]]s without proper training. In some cases, people land on their neck or head, which can cause paralysis or even death.&lt;ref name="Pediatrics"/&gt; In an infamous incident in the 1960s, pole-vaulting champion [[Brian Sternberg]] became paralyzed from the neck down in a trampoline accident.

Danger can be reduced by burying the trampoline so the bed is closer to the surrounding surface to lessen falling distance, and padding that surrounding area. Pads over the spring and frame reduce the severity of impact injuries. Keeping the springs covered also reduces the risk of a limb falling between the gaps in the springs and the rest of the body falling off the trampoline.

Kits are available for home trampolines that provide a [[Trampoline safety net enclosure|retaining net]] around the trampoline and prevent users from bouncing over the edge. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that there is no epidemiological evidence that these improve safety.&lt;ref name="Pediatrics"/&gt; The nets do prevent jumpers falling off the trampoline onto the ground, but these falls are not the most common source of injury. Multiple users bouncing in a netted trampoline can still be injured. Safety net enclosures have a larger benefit for safeguarding solo trampolinists, so long as they avoid falling on their head or neck.

Having some training in a gym may be beneficial in alerting people to possible hazards and provide techniques to avoid bad falls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/05/trampoline.html  Trampoline Safety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208221539/http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/05/trampoline.html |date=February 8, 2009 }}, Consumer Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;

Family-oriented commercial areas in North America, such as shopping centres, carnivals, and so on, often include [[closed inflatable trampoline]]s (CITs) as a children's attraction. These have safety nets on the sides to prevent injuries.

==Mini-trampolines==
[[File:MiniTrampoline.jpg|thumb|Mini-trampoline]]
A mini-trampoline (also known as a rebounder, trampette, jogging trampoline, or exercise trampoline) is a type of trampoline less than {{convert|1|m}} in diameter and about {{convert|30|cm}} off the ground, often kept indoors and used as part of a [[physical fitness]] regime. So-called [[rebound exercise|rebounding]] provides a form of exercise with a low impact on knees and joints. Mini-trampolines do not give a rebound as high as larger recreational or competitive trampolines. Most department and [[big-box store]]s sell mini-trampolines.

==Educational use==
In co-operation with the [[University of Bremen]] and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the machtWissen.de Corporation from Bremen, Germany developed the weightlessness demonstrator "Gravity Jumper" based on a trampoline. Due to the acceleration during the jump, an acceleration force takes effect in addition to the usual gravitational force. Both forces add up and the person on the trampoline seems to become heavier. As soon as the jumper leaves the trampoline, he is under a [[free fall]] condition, which means that the jumper seems weightless and does not feel the acceleration due to gravity.
Every person receives a three-axis acceleration sensor, fastened to them with a belt. The sensor transmits the data of the flight path to a monitor; a monitor shows the course of the acceleration, including the weightless phase. The interplay of [[acceleration]] due to the trampoline and weightlessness becomes apparent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18377">The term transformation (also "transition" or "system change") in the field of [[mediated cross-border communication]]  refers to
a media system's change from for instance [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] or [[Communism|communist]] structures to a new media system with different [[structure]]s and control mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Hadamik"&gt;Hadamik (2004), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared  to the studies of media systems, transformation research is focused on the [[collective]] and [[individual]] actors who "demand, support, and manage change".&lt;ref&gt;Kleinsteuber (2010), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; They can be found in [[government]]s, [[Political party|parties]], [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], civil society organizations or [[Advocacy group|interest groups]]. To the largest extent, transformation research addresses change from [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] to [[Democracy|democratic]] media systems. Since transformation processes in media systems are always linked to the political and [[socioeconomic development]], transformation research is not solely focused on the transformation of the media systems, but also on sectors like [[politics]], [[economy]], [[society]], or [[culture]].&lt;ref name="Hadamik" /&gt;

Transformation  research is a comparative approach, since processes in different stages of the [[Political system|political]] or media system are compared. The approach is highly complex, because it combines comparison with the dimension of space and time, for instance by analyzing similar change processes of media systems in different world regions and times in history. This causes problems, because the changing systems can exhibit considerable differences between one another. Although there are differences between them, transformation processes often occur at the same time and significant similarities between the resulting patterns can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;Kleinsteuber (2010), p. 23-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interrelation between transformation processes of political and media systems ==

The transformation research on media systems has its origin in transformation studies of [[political science]]s. Fragments of [[political science]] theories were applied in comparative [[media studies]],&lt;ref&gt;Kleinsteuber (2010), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  since transformation processes of media systems are strongly connected to the transformation of [[political system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Voltmer (2008), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Katharina Hadamik (2003) describes this connection as "political-medial transformation-parallelism". She stresses that the media system in a [[State (polity)|state]] cannot take any path of transformation. It is connected to the transformation of the [[political system]]. For instance, [[State (polity)|states]] which develop democratic structures and [[constitution]]al conditions in their [[political system]] also build out free or relatively free media systems. In contrast, media systems in [[State (polity)|states]] with weaker or even no transformation of the [[political system]] have much higher barriers of development to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Hadamik (2004), p. 54-56.&lt;/ref&gt; So, "it is the political system that ultimately has the power to make binding decisions and thus shapes the basic structure and functioning of the media system".&lt;ref name="Voltmer"&gt;Voltmer (2012), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; This strong connection between [[political system|political]] and media system can be emphasized by watching the process of transformation from an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] to a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[political system|system]] in both [[politic]]s and [[media (communication)|media]].

The transformation from an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] to a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[political system]] has three phases:&lt;ref&gt;Merkel (1999), p. 119-169.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Phase 1: end of the old [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[regime]]

Phase 2: transformation and [[institutionalisation]] of [[democracy]]

Phase 3: [[democratic consolidation|consolidation of democracy]] through a new system

The process of transformation from an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] to a [[Democracy|democratic]] media system also has three phases, similar to the phases of transformation in [[political system]]s:&lt;ref&gt;Hadamik (2004), p. 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase 1: breakthrough in the media sector

Phase 2: fixation of the changes in the [[Media (communication)|media]] sector

Phase 3: development of a stable media system

== Types of transformation processes==

In comparative media system research, scholars have identified three processes of change in media systems: homogenization, heterogenization, and hybridization.

=== Homogenization towards one model of media systems ===

In  the field of comparative media system research, homogenization is defined as the convergence of many media systems towards one specific model, caused by changes in [[Political structure|political]] and [[economy|economic]] structures, commercialization, and [[technological change|changes in technology]]. [[culture|Cultural]] differences between the countries are said to become less important, since a few international [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] dominate the global [[media (communication)|media]] industry. In 2004, the authors Hallin and Mancini  attested a convergence of European media systems towards the [[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics#The three models of media and politics|Liberal Media System]] prevalent in North America, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Relating to the convergence of media systems, four constitutive factors can be identified:&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004a), p. 25-41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 251-254, 294-295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boczkowski, Mitchelstein &amp; Walter (2011), p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Americanization: The changing [[organizational structure]]s and behaviors within the [[Media (communication)|media]] are heading towards patterns first established in the United States. Moreover, the US American model of politically neutral and professional [[journalism]] is becoming more and more influential for other media systems. The journalistic education of the United States has said to have been a strong influence on journalism cultures worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004a), p. 25-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 254-259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2008), p. 119-122.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Technological change: New [[technology|technologies]] can lead to adaptations by individuals and social [[institution]]s, for instance assuming new communication procedures associated with the new [[technology]]. These effects often produce common practices across different [[social environment|social contexts]]. The development of professional [[journalism]] is also connected to [[technological change]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 259-261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2008), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Secularization]]: The term [[secularization]] describes "the separation of citizens from attachments of religious and ideological 'faiths,' and the decline of institutions based on these faiths".&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; This separation results in a decline of political parties, since they are connected to [[ideology|ideologies]] and particular social milieus. Hence, [[secularization]] leads media systems towards the [[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics#The three models of media and politics|Liberal Model]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004a), p. 28-32, 34-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 263-267.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Commercialization: Commercialization can be seen as the most important force of homogenization. It has changed the print [[media (communication)|media]] as well as the electronic [[media (communication)|media]]. The transition of European broadcasting systems, from predominantly public service systems in the 1970s to a system with commercial domination today, gave the strongest impetus for homogenization. Thus, commercialization decreases the ties of media system and [[political system]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004a), p. 38-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 273-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a tendency of homogenization towards the [[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics#The three models of media and politics|Liberal Model]] can be attested, there still are important differences between the systems. First of all, the variations between the [[political system]]s of each country seem to persist in the future. Furthermore, the [[party system|party]] and [[voting system|electoral systems]] between the countries remain different. Moreover, the [[List of country legal systems|legal systems]] of the countries are still distinct. Also, even though there is a trend towards neutral journalism, [[political parallelism]] in the national press of [[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics#The three models of media and politics|Democratic Corporatist]] countries still persists and will probably remain in the immediate future. Thus, a complete converge of the media systems seems unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 282-287, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boczkowski, Mitchelstein &amp; Walter (2011), p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2008), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also limits and countertendencies against homogenization. There is evidence of countertendencies relating to the reduction of [[Polarization (politics)|political polarization]] and [[ideology|ideological]] differences between parties. In some countries, new extremist parties on the far right of the political spectrum arose, motivated through issues of [[immigration]], [[multiculturalism]] and integration. Moreover, so called [[advocacy journalism]] does not only persist in [[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics#The three models of media and politics|Polarized Pluralist]] countries (especially in Italy, Spain and Greece), but new forms of it are also beginning to proliferate in all kinds of media systems.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 284-285, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heterogenization of media systems ===

Some scholars argue against the [[theory]] of homogenization of media systems that due to national [[political culture]]s and [[institution]]s, a process of heterogenization rather than homogenization, has to be stated.&lt;ref&gt;Boczkowski, Mitchelstein &amp; Walter (2011), p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The countertendencies of homogenization (for instance new right extremist parties, new forms of [[advocacy journalism]], divergence processes in the styles of election coverage between the United States and Great Britain) lead to heterogenization of the media systems.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 284-285.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the divergence of media systems is confronted by a much more fundamental convergence between them.&lt;ref&gt;Boczkowski, Mitchelstein &amp; Walter (2011), p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; Hallin &amp; Mancini also argue that the results of their analysis do not support the thesis of heterogenization of media systems.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004b), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hybridization of media systems ===

Hybrid media systems are defined as a blend of already existing practices and new practices from a new or foreign media system. Foreign models are adapted to the particular [[history|historical]], geographical, [[social]], and [[culture|cultural]] characteristics of the domestic media system.&lt;ref name="Voltmer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Albuquerque (2012), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hadamik (2004), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coman (2000), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a temporary state of transformation, hybrid media systems are considered an [[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] between two types of practices. Thus, hybrid media systems are mostly located between [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[democracy|democratic]] [[political system]]s. Although they may have introduced competitive elections, they may not strengthen further [[democracy|democratic]] [[institution]]s beyond the basic requirements. Therefore, the degree to which hybrid systems adopt [[democracy|democratic]] practices can vary from state to state. Hybrid systems build out distinct patterns of politic-media relations with significant differences to Western media systems,&lt;ref&gt;Voltmer (2012), p. 231-245.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roudakova (2012), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; for instance the Brazilian media system, which was influenced by the American [[journalism]] model. However, the American [[journalism]] system was not adopted one-to-one, since there "was no solid [[market economy]], [[individualistic culture]], or [[political culture]] that valued the freedom of press".&lt;ref&gt;de Albuquerque (2012), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the media system of Poland, which detached itself from its [[communism|communist]] ties in the 1990s and converged towards Western media systems, but still has its Polish specifics, such as the use of [[Public broadcasting|public-service broadcasting]] as a political instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Hadamik (2004), p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the three phases from an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] to a [[democracy|democratic]] media system, the old [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] system ends by the [[institutionalisation]] of [[democracy|democratic]] elements (phase 1 and 2). In the third phase, the new hybrid system consolidates [[democracy|democratic]] elements, but some elements of the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] system still exist. Thus, it is difficult to state when the third phase is completed.

In Hallin &amp; Mancini's ''Comparing media systems beyond the western world'' (2012), which gives an overview of criticism about their [[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics|framework of 2004]] and furthermore extends and revises it, Katrin Voltmer states that, instead of media system homogenization towards the [[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics#The three models of media and politics|Liberal Model]] of Hallin &amp; Mancini's framework, transformation processes rather move towards hybrid media systems, since [[media (communication)|media]] markets become more international, but have to adapt to local situations. Thus, the theory of hybridization in media systems is rather an adaption than a counterpart to the theory of convergence.&lt;ref&gt;Voltmer (2012), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outlook ==
A consistent transformation [[theory]] valid for all transformation processes and countries, does not yet exist, since it is difficult to cover the variety and complexity of all the processes. Some researchers are of the opinion that it is impossible to find a consistent theory of transformation processes, because of the historical, political and social particularities of each country and their different types of transformation processes.&lt;ref&gt;Hadamik (2004), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the debate about convergence, divergence, or hybridization of media systems is still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;Boczkowski, Mitchelstein &amp; Walter (2011), p. 377, 385-391.&lt;/ref&gt;
