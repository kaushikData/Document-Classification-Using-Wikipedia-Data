The '''[[1997–98 NHL season|1997–98]] [[Calgary Flames]] season''' was the [[Calgary Flames seasons|18th]] [[National Hockey League]] [[Season (sports)|season]] in [[Calgary]]. After a disappointing [[1996–97 NHL season|1996–97]] season, the Flames looked to newly hired coach [[Brian Sutter]] to return the Flames to the playoffs.

The off-season featured the trade of highly popular forward [[Gary Roberts (ice hockey)|Gary Roberts]] shortly before the season began. Roberts missed the entire [[1996–97 NHL season]] due to injury after playing only 35 games in [[1995–96 Calgary Flames season|1995–96]]. Feeling that playing in the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] with its lower travel would help aid him in his comeback, the Flames agreed to trade Roberts. He was dealt, along with starting goaltender [[Trevor Kidd]] to the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] for [[Andrew Cassels]] and [[Jean-Sébastien Giguère|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]].&lt;ref&gt;Dolezar, Jon A., [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/news/2001/08/08/sayitaintso_flames/ Say it aint so: Calgary Flames], cnnsi.com, August 8, 2001, Accessed January 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The season would serve as a bitter disappointment for the Flames from start to end, as the Flames would struggle to score goals all season long, ultimately finishing with the worst record in Calgary history at 26–41–15, while 67 points was the lowest in franchise history since the expansion [[Atlanta Flames]] managed just 65 in [[1972–73 NHL season|1972–73]].

[[Theoren Fleury]] was named to the North American team at the [[48th National Hockey League All-Star Game|1998 NHL All Star Game]], where he recorded two assists playing on a line with [[Wayne Gretzky]] and [[Mark Recchi]]. Defenceman [[Derek Morris (ice hockey)|Derek Morris]] was named a Rookie All Star.&lt;ref&gt;All Star Selections, 2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleury also represented Canada at the [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano, Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorkrangers.com/pressbox/pressreleases.asp?id=3 New York Rangers press release], July 8, 1999, accessed January 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the start of the season, the Flames purchased the [[Western Hockey League]]'s [[Calgary Hitmen]] for approximately $1.5 million. The struggling franchise was nearly destroyed by the fallout of the [[Graham James (ice hockey)|Graham James]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Miller |title=Hitmen finally go up in Flames |publisher=Calgary Sun |page=S5 |date=1997-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regular season==

On Friday, October 17, 1997, the Flames scored three short-handed goals in a 6-5 win over the Colorado Avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hockey-reference.com/boxscores/199710170CGY.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmed Zabana Stadium''' ({{lang-ar|ملعب أحمد زبانة}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Oran]], [[Algeria]].  It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches. It is the home ground of [[MC Oran]]. The stadium holds 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondedufoot.fr/stades/ahmed-zabana-oran Stadium profile] - ''mondedufoot''&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, a new stadium, called [[Olympic Stadium of Oran|Olympic Stadium]], is being constructed.

==History==
[[Image:Stade Ahmed Zabana (old picture).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Old picture of the stadium]]
The stadium was built in 1955 in the [[Oran#El Hamri|El Hamri]] district of [[Oran]], known as Lyautey at the time, by mayor Henri Fouquès-Duparc. The stadium was inaugurated on 5 May 1957 with a capacity of 40,000 spectators, making it the biggest stadium in Africa at the time. After the independence of Algeria it was renamed ''Municipal Stadium''. After it was named again ''Stade 19 Juin 1965'' in commemoration of the coup of [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] by [[Houari Boumediene]] made at that date. It was then renamed again to Stade Ahmed Zabana in honor of Algerian revolutionary [[Ahmed Zabana]].

In January 2008, it was renovated to make it compatible with the practice of [[Rugby union]]. It was equipped with artificial turf (fifth generation) to replace natural grass in poor condition. In the 2016-17 domestic league season, tenants MC Oran drew an average home attendance of 12,000.

==History==
===Planning and construction===
The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported on May 17, 2015 that the team chose the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena site to build a 22,000-seat [[state of the art]] stadium for the MLS in Exposition Park, costing $250 million. The group estimated the project would create 1,200 temporary construction jobs and 1,800 full-time jobs, generating $2.5 million in annual tax revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Expansion L.A.

On May 6, 2016, the [[Los Angeles City Council]] approved the stadium, clearing a way for the construction of the stadium.

A groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 23, 2016. At the event attended by owners and construction crews, LAFC announced a 15-year, $100 million [[naming right]]s deal for the stadium with the [[Banc of California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=August 23, 2016 |title=LAFC owners join with Los Angeles business and community leaders to break ground on Bank of California Stadium |url=https://lafc.com/lafc-owners-break-ground-on-state-of-the-art-soccer-venue-to-be-named-banc-of-california-stadium/ |publisher=Los Angeles FC |accessdate=August 23, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825114904/https://lafc.com/lafc-owners-break-ground-on-state-of-the-art-soccer-venue-to-be-named-banc-of-california-stadium/ |archivedate=August 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Koren |first=James Rufus |date=August 23, 2016 |title=Banc of California snags naming rights for L.A.

A northeast slice of the stadium was designed to be open to capture the downtown Los Angeles skyline and the San Gabriel Mountains. Members of the media in the angled press box have one of the best vantage points to peer through the "keyhole".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2018/04/23/pool-parties-secret-rooms-local-culture-10-things-about-lafcs-new-home&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 3252/The North End ===
The ground’s North End is home to the 3252 independent supporters’ union and their “safe standing” section which is among the league’s steepest at 34 degrees. The stand’s angled handrails were designed reminiscent of gripping the safety bar on a roller coaster, and for a less encumbered view. The central section of the stand is an actual removable stage — something built in to allow the stadium to play a role beyond regular MLS matchdays for concerts and events.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2018/04/23/pool-parties-secret-rooms-local-culture-10-things-about-lafcs-new-home&lt;/ref&gt; On top of the North End is a supporter-designed bar which can only be accessed from 3252 section.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2018/04/29/bar-offers-unique-experience-lafcs-3252-supporters&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''Battle of Bramall Lane''' is the informal name given to an [[Football League First Division|English First Division]] [[association football|football]] match between [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at United's [[Bramall Lane]] ground on 16 March 2002. The match was unusual in that it was abandoned because Sheffield United had only six players left on the pitch.

==Background==
With eight league matches of the [[2001-02 Football League|2001–02]] season remaining,{{#tag:ref|Both Albion and United had played 38 games, although some other teams in the division had played 35 or 39.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}|group="nb"}} Albion lay in third place in the First Division on 67 points, 11 points behind rivals [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], who occupied the second automatic promotion spot. United meanwhile were in 15th position on 50 points, safe from relegation but not threatening the playoff places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|title=Football League Division 1 table – Updated 15 March 2002
|url=http://www.wba.premiumtv.co.uk/page/LeagueTable/0,,10366~20020315,00.html
|publisher=West Bromwich Albion F.C.
|date=15 March 2002
|accessdate=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Match summary==

Nine minutes in, United's keeper, [[Simon Tracey]], was sent off for handling the ball outside the penalty area and denying Albion an obvious goalscoring opportunity. Sheffield United manager [[Neil Warnock]] sent on the substitute keeper, [[Wilko de Vogt]], taking off [[Peter Ndlovu]]. The visiting WBA scored a first-half goal through [[Scott Dobie]] against the 10-man United, and added a second goal in the 62nd minute through [[Derek McInnes]].

The match turned truly ugly in the 65th minute, when [[Georges Santos]], whom United had just brought on seconds earlier, was sent off for a high and poorly timed two-footed lunging tackle on [[Andy Johnson (Welsh footballer)|Andy Johnson]]. When Johnson was playing for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] the previous season, he had fractured Santos' cheekbone and seriously damaged his eye socket with a swinging elbow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/oct/11/footballs-greatest-rivalries-cruyff-van-gaal?|title=From Cruyff v Van Gaal to Winterburn v McClair – football's greatest feuds|date=11 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two teams then scuffled on the pitch; in the mêlée, another United substitute, [[Patrick Suffo]], was sent off for head-butting [[Derek McInnes]]. This reduced United to eight men, with no more substitutions left. Soon after, United captain [[Keith Curle]] was fortunate to avoid a sending off after appearing to throw punches at McInnes.

In the 77th minute, WBA added a third goal, Scott Dobie tapping in from short range. Two minutes later, [[Michael Brown (footballer, born 1977)|Michael Brown]] limped off for United, and [[Robert Ullathorne]] went off injured in the 82nd minute, reducing them to six men. The referee, [[Eddie Wolstenholme]], then abandoned the game with West Brom leading 3–0. The referee would have been aware of the [[IFAB|IFA board]] guideline to [[Laws of the Game (association football)|law]] 3 which states "the minimum number of players in a team is left to the discretion of member associations. The Board is of the opinion, however, that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team".

==Aftermath==
[[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] manager [[Gary Megson]] stated after the match:
{{quote|There will be no replay. If we are called back to Bramall Lane we shall kick-off and then walk off the pitch. I've been in professional football since 16 and I'm 42 now. I've never ever witnessed anything as disgraceful as that.

West Bromwich Albion were awarded a 3–0 win and the 3 points by the Football League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/championship/3020507/West-Brom-awarded-three-points-after-Battle-of-Bramall-Lane.html|title=West Brom awarded three points after 'Battle of Bramall Lane'|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=21 March 2002|accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] were fined £10,000, [[Patrick Suffo]] £3,000 plus a 6 match ban (3 for the dismissal, 3 for violent conduct), [[Keith Curle]] £500 and a 2 match ban, [[Georges Santos]] a 6 match ban (4, plus 2 for violent conduct) and [[Neil Warnock]] £300 for improper conduct towards the 4th official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/may/03/newsstory.sport7|title=Blades fined £10,000 over Battle of Bramall Lane|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 May 2012|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georges Santos and Patrick Suffo never played for United again.

Sheffield United finished the season 13th in the league, whilst West Brom were automatically promoted - the potential goal difference increase they missed in not completing the game was not crucial.

'''Composite rules shinty–hurling''' ({{lang-ga|Rialacha chomhréiteach sinteag-iomáint}})—sometimes known simply as '''shinty–hurling'''—is a [[hybrid sports|hybrid sport]] which was developed to facilitate international matches between [[shinty|shinty players]] and [[hurling|hurling players]].

Shinty–hurling is one of few [[team sport]]s in the world without any dedicated clubs or leagues. It is currently played by both men's and women's teams only in tournaments or once-off internationals. The women's form of the game is called shinty/camogie.

[[Ireland national hurling team|Ireland]] are the leading team in the sport, having won sixteen of the thirty international series against [[Scotland national shinty team|Scotland]] to date.

==Rules==
The rules of the composite sport are designed to allow for neither side to gain an advantage, eliminating or imposing certain restrictions. The goals are those used in hurling, with 3 points for a goal (in the net under the crossbar) and 1 point for a shot over the crossbar. A stationary ball taken straight from the ground and shot over the crossbar scores 2 points.  For the 2012 International Series, a goal became worth 5 points in an effort to increase the number of goals. This was rule was abandoned for the 2013 series, in favour of the traditional model of 3 points for a goal.

Players may not catch the ball unless they are the goalkeeper (or a defender on the line for a penalty) and this must be released within three steps. Players may not kick the ball, but can drag the ball with their foot.

Although there is a statutory size for the ball to be used in the games, there is often a custom of using a [[sliotar]] in one half and a shinty ball in the other. Each half lasts 35 minutes.

==History==
The first games played were challenge matches between [[London Camanachd]] and [[London GAA]] in 1896 and Glasgow Cowal and Dublin Celtic in 1897 and 1898, with the first game played at [[Celtic Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0084/|title=The first combined shinty/hurling match 1897|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was then a hiatus until Scottish representative teams and Irish sides took place in the 1920s.  Following intermittent international games between Scotland and an all-Ireland team before the [[Second World War]], controversy arose as the [[British Government]] put pressure upon the [[Camanachd Association]] to cease from co-operating with the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], disapproving of their perceived anti-British viewpoint&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Fraser|last=MacKenzie|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20001008/ai_n13954047|title=Celtic festival sees codes come together|newspaper=The Sunday Herald|date=8 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/sport/Hurling-himself-into-the-battle.5764121.jp|title=Hurling himself into the battle|newspaper=Scotland on Sunday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, universities in both countries kept the link going after the war and this led to a resumption of international fixtures between the two codes in the 1970s.

After a long run of Irish successes, Scotland won four fixtures in a row from 2005 until Ireland reclaimed the title in 2009. Scotland's successes have been marred by a lack of interest from an Irish perspective. Unlike the [[international rules football]] tests between Australia and Ireland, few players from the top flight counties participate in the event—though in recent times this trend has bucked and more higher ranked Irish players have represented their nation.

2007 also saw the use of compromise rules as a way of developing the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] languages in Ireland and [[Scotland]] by the [[Columba Initiative]]. A team called [[Alba (shinty club)|Alba]], made up of Scottish Gaelic speakers, played [[Míchael Breathnach CLG]], from [[Inverin]], [[Galway]]. The project was repeated in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shinty.com/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=130&amp;cntnt01returnid=15|title=Gaelic team to represent Scotland in Galway|work=Camanachd Association|accessdate=8 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaelic speakers international was played for a third time in 2010 in Portree in the Isle of Skye on 13 February 2010.

There are also Scottish/Irish women's and under-21s sides which have competed against one another.

In 2009, the first full shinty/hurling match in the United States took place between [[Skye Camanachd]] and the [[San Francisco GAA|San Francisco Rovers]].

In 2010, the fixture was played at [[Croke Park]] before the [[international rules football]] game and then a return leg was played at the [[Bught Park]] two weeks later.

On 28 April 2012 the inaugural match between the teams of [[Irish Defence Forces]] and the [[British Army]] was played at [[Bught Park]] in aid of [[Earl Haig Fund Scotland|PoppyScotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/irish-and-british-forces-in-historic-sports-meeting-1-2261815|title=Irish and British forces in historic sports meeting|newspaper=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International series==
{{main|Shinty/Hurling International Series}}
An international series for men, women and under 21s is played annually, with test matches rotating between venues in [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]]. Ireland are the leading team in the series, having won 9 of 16 senior men's test matches. [[Camogie]]-Shinty is the women's version of the game.

'''Cricket Canada''', known as the '''Canadian Cricket Association (CCA)''' until November 2007, is the [[Sport governing body|governing body]] of [[cricket]] in [[Canada]]. It was established in 1892 and has its current headquarters in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. It administers the national [[Canadian cricket team|men's]] and [[Canada national women's cricket team|women's]] teams as well as several youth teams at various age levels. In addition Cricket Canada and its affiliates run several grassroots and development programs and leagues across the country. Cricket Canada is Canada's representative at the [[International Cricket Council]] and has been an associate member of that body since 1968. It is included in the [[ICC Americas]] region.

==History==
{{main|Cricket in Canada}}
Cricket was once the most popular sport in Canada until the early 20th Century before it was overtaken by hockey. Cricket was so popular it was declared the national sport by [[Sir John A. Macdonald]], the first Prime Minister of Canada. Cricket, today, is a popular minority sport in Canada, although it is growing. Cricket is the fastest growing sport in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daikynguyen.com/eet/print_archive/united_states/boston/2006/04-APR/24/A6.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708220719/http://www.daikynguyen.com/eet/print_archive/united_states/boston/2006/04-APR/24/A6.pdf |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadiancricket.org/images/CCA%20Heritage%20Fund.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001091840/http://www.canadiancricket.org/images/CCA%20Heritage%20Fund.pdf |archivedate=1 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2008/cc/bgrd/mm21.6.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has well over 40,000 cricketers across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2008/06/22/spt18.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080621.wcricket21/BNStory/National/?page=rss&amp;id=RTGAM.20080621.wcricket21]&lt;/ref&gt; While Canada is not sanctioned to play [[Test cricket|Test matches]], [[Canada national cricket team|the team]] does take part in [[One Day International]] (ODI) matches and also in first-class games (in the ICC Intercontinental Cup) against other non-Test-playing opposition, with the rivalry against the [[United States national cricket team|United States]] being as strong in cricket as it is in other team sports. The match between these two nations is in fact the [[United States v Canada (1844)|oldest international fixture in cricket]], having first been played in 1844. This international fixture even outdates the Olympics by over 50 years. There are a few grounds in Canada that are sanctioned by the ICC to host official ODI's. The most famous Canadian cricketer is [[John Davison (Canadian cricketer)|John Davison]], who was born in Canada but raised in Australia and participated in the [[Cricket World Cup]] in 2003, 2007 and 2011. At the 2003 World Cup, Davison hit the fastest century in tournament history against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in what was ultimately a losing cause. In that World Cup he also smashed a half century at a strike rate of almost 200 against New Zealand. One year later, in the ICC Intercontinental Cup against the US, he proved the difference between the two sides taking 17 wickets for 137 runs as well as scoring 84 runs of his own. In the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] in the West Indies, John Davison scored the second-fastest half-century against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]]. Canada has participated in the 1979, 2003 and 2007 [[Cricket World Cup]]s. Canada has traditionally had a strong Women's team. Also The Canadian Under 19 team have competed in the Under 19 World Cup on two occasions. In 2002, they were eliminated in the first round, meaning they competed in the plate competition, in which they did not win a game. They repeated this performance in the 2004 competition.

===Early 2000s===
2004 started badly for Canada, with a last place finish in the Six Nations Challenge in the [[United Arab Emirates]] after Canada lost all their games. They'd improved significantly by the time of the ICC Americas Championship in [[Bermuda]], which they won. Also in 2004, Canada participated in the first [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]], finishing as runners up to Scotland. The highlight of this tournament was the game against the US in [[Fort Lauderdale]], Florida, when John Davison recorded the best match bowling figures since [[Jim Laker]]'s 19 wickets against Australia in 1956.

In 2005, Canada again finished third in the [[2005 ICC Trophy|ICC Trophy]], which gained them official ODI status from 2006 until the [[2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier]], as well as qualifying them for the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]]. Their performance in the Intercontinental Cup that year was not as good as in 2004 however, as they did not make it past the first round.

In 2006, Canada put in good performances in the four-day [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]], beating [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]] by 25 runs and [[Bermudian cricket team|Bermuda]] by nine wickets, but their one-day form was a complete reversal, losing three times to Bermuda and Kenya, and a further loss to [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]].

In August 2006, Canada took part in the Division 1 of the Americas Championship. They beat [[Argentine cricket team|Argentina]] and longtime rivals the [[United States cricket team|USA]], but lost to the [[Cayman Islands cricket team|Cayman Islands]] and eventual winners Bermuda, and finished third, their worst performance so far in this tournament.

===2008===
In June and July 2008, Canada hosted Bermuda for three ODIs and Intercontinental Cup matches against Bermuda and Scotland.

In August, Canada traveled to Ireland for the World Twenty20 Qualification Tournament. Canada did not qualify for the World Twenty20, finishing 5th ahead of Bermuda. The ODIs and an Intercontinental Cup match were hampered by rain.

In late summer of 2008, [[West Indies national cricket team|West Indies]] and [[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermuda]] came to Canada to play One-Day Scotiabank Series with Canada. Canada defeated Bermuda, to face West Indies in the Final. West Indies captain [[Chris Gayle]] smashed his sixteenth ODI century and led his side to an easy seven-wicket victory against Canada in the finals of the Scotiabank ODI Series at King City.

During the Scotiabank Series the talents of [[Rizwan Cheema]] were discovered – he would become the star of the first Al-Barakah T20 Canada. The tournament involved Canada, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Canada lost all three of their matches, however the loss to Zimbabwe came in a bowl-out. Sri Lanka were eventual winners, defeating Pakistan in the Final. The tournament is expected to be played annually for the next four years.

In late November 2008, Canada participated in the Americas Championship in Florida, USA. The United States, after years of disarray, pulled together and won the championship. Canada finished 3rd on Net Run Rate behind Bermuda, as their match was washed out due to rain.

===2009===

Canada began its innings in 2009 by planting its front foot forward.

Bold management decisions allowed Cricket Canada to sign seven players to central contracts in 2008 and increased ICC funding in 2009 allowed this to continue as  a move designed to regularise training sessions with a core group of cricketers. For the likes of Rizwan Cheema, who had been working in a fast-food restaurant called Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits, quitting the day job to play cricket was an easy decision; others, such as investment banker Ashish Bagai, had to mull it over before signing, even with the global financial crisis raging.

Following this, the team headed to Sri Lanka for a training camp that would forever change the face of Canadian Cricket. For the first time in its history the players were exposed to a first-class environment and they responded by dominating the opening stages of the 2009 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. This led to a second-place finish and an invitation to the 2011 Cricket World Cup

===2010===

In late January the Canadian team embarked for Sri Lanka to play some warm-up matches ahead of the World Twenty20 Qualifiers in the UAE, which were to be followed by two ODIs and a four-day Intercontinental Cup match against Afghanistan.
In January 2010, Canada's u19 team also made history as they upset heavily favoured Zimbabwe in the first match of the 2010 u19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand. The Canadians built of this all round upset to finish a best ever 11th place at the tournament.

Also in January 2010, Canada's men's team travelled to Sri Lanka to take part in the Sri Lanka Cricket Four Nations Cup with Sri Lanka 'A', Ireland and Afghanistan. Canada again made history by producing the first ever live broadcast of an associates cricket match. The production was well received and has paved the way for more such broadcasts in the future.

In February 2010 Canada participated in the 2010 ICC T20 Cricket World Cup qualification tournament in which they failed to register a win and were eliminated after the first round.

In March 2010, Cricket Canada Directors for the first time voted in president, Ranjit Saini.

In April 2010, Cricket Canada declared its inability to host the 2012 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, which it had committed to hosting in 2007.

Canada emerged winless from an April tour of the Caribbean playing Jamaica in a 50-over and Twenty20 game, West Indies XI in a Twenty20 game and the West Indies in a One-day international.

Canada's presence in the America's also let to a relationship being developed with the West Indies Cricket Board. This included an invitation from WICB for Canada to participate in the Caribbean T20 tournament. Though not winning a game the tournament was a success for Canada as a relationship was created with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. CBC webcast all of Canada's matches and had stronger viewer ratings for this.

In June 2010, Canada stamped its authority in the Americas by winning all matches at the Americas Cup tournament in Bermuda and finishing finalists with winners USA in the Americas Twenty20. Canada also played Ireland in a drawn warm-up match in the Netherlands before the start of World Cricket League Div 1 (Ireland's top-string team was playing Australia in Dublin).

Canada finish the year with some energy losing the 4-day match at home to Zimbabwe and Ireland but defeating top ranked Ireland in an ODI in front of a packed house at the Toronto Cricket Club. Cricket was firmly back in the city of Toronto and the team responded.

The year closed off with the Cricket Canada summer festival taking place at Malton Cricket Club. A strong West Indies High Performance Team (containing players with test and ODI players) split their matches with Canada in two hard-fought contests.

That November, the board decided to send the team to the World Cricket Academy in India. The 4-week trip included games in 4 cities for preparation ahead of the 2011 Cricket World Cup

===2011===

Canada played two major tournaments in the first part of 2011, firstly the Caribbean T20 tournament. Participating for the second time in the West Indies domestic T20 competition, Canada defeated heavily favoured Hampshire before fighting Trinidad and Tobago to the last ball in the opening two matches of the tournament.

From the West Indies, Canada traveled to Dubai splitting matches with Netherlands and Afghanistan before arriving at the 2011 Cricket World Cup. At this tournament Canada recorded great performances from skipper [[Ashish Bagai]], [[Henry Osinde]], [[Jimmy Hansra]], [[WD Balaji Rao]], [[Hiral Patel]] and others as they won only their second ever match at a Cricket World Cup. The performance was a steady one by a young Canadian team and has set the table for an exciting future. Hansra was named captain of the team following Bagai's retirement

Canada finished 2011 with a string of losses in both ODI's and Intercontinental Cup Matches to Afghanistan (in Toronto) and Ireland (in Dublin). Canada finished tied for first with T&amp;T and Afghanistan at the Etihad Airways Summer Cricket Festival (in Toronto)

===2012===

Canada participated in the Caribbean T20 tournament again in 2012 losing all 4 matches. Thousands of Canadian's watched the matches on Rogers Sportsnet ONE giving the team unprecedented domestic exposure.

Following the tournament, Canada participated in the 2012 T20 Cricket World Cup Qualification Tournament in UAE. Canada finished 6th in the tournament and did not qualify for the 2012 T20 Cricket World Cup.

In April, Ravin Moorthy was elected the new president of Cricket Canada succeeding Ranjit Saini. Moorthy was joined on the board by Vimal Hardat, Amit Joshi, Charles Pais and Calvin Clarke. At this meeting Newfoundland and Labrador were admitted to the Cricket Canada family as the 10th provincial member of the organization.

Canada's women's team won the ICC America's Division 1 T20 Tournament in April 2012. This tournament served as the preliminary round of the ICC T20 Women's Cricket World Cup which will be played in 2014 in India. Canada has advanced to the next round of qualification.

Canada hired former West Indian Cricketer [[Gus Logie]] as its national head coach in May 2012.

In November 2012, Canada's men's team will travel to USA to play the United States in the [[K.A. Auty Cup]]. The trophy has been contested between Canada and USA since 1844 and it remains the world's oldest ongoing international sporting fixture

[[File:Liebig bike polo.jpg|thumb|Cycle-ball, early 20th century]]
'''Cycle-ball''', also known as "radball" (from [[German language|German]]), is a sport similar to [[association football]] played on [[bicycle]]s.  The two people on each team ride a [[fixed gear bicycle]] with no brakes or [[freewheel]]. The ball is controlled by the bike and the head, except when defending the goal.

The sport was introduced in 1893 by a German-American, Nicholas Edward Kaufmann. Its first world championships were in 1929. Cycle-ball is popular in [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], [[Russia]] and [[Switzerland]]. The most successful players were the [[Pospíšil brothers]] of [[Czechoslovakia]], world champions 20 times between 1965 and 1988.

Closely related is [[artistic cycling]] in which the athletes perform a kind of [[gymnastics]] on Cycles.

'''Damaschke Field''', officially '''Dutch Damaschke Stadium''', is a sports [[playing field]] and [[stadium]] in [[Oneonta, New York]]. Primarily used for [[baseball]], the field has been a municipal landmark for over a hundred years.

==History==
[[File:Damaschke Field in Oneonta, NY 2009.jpg|thumb|right]]
The original [[baseball field]] was officially opened on [[Memorial Day]] in 1905 under the name Elm Park.&lt;ref name=Star19700623&gt;{{Cite news|title=Old ballpark has seen the greats |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/848743// |newspaper=The Oneonta Star |date=June 23, 1970 |page=11 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014 }}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous stars from the early years of US baseball, including [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Rogers Hornsby]], drew large crowds at the field for semi-pro and exposition games. A permanent steel grandstand was erected for spectators in 1938.&lt;ref name=Star19700623/&gt;

In August 1968, the city renamed the site as Dutch Damaschke Stadium to honor local sports coach, referee, and counselor Ernest C. "Dutch" Damaschke, who had served as Oneonta's Recreation Commissioner for more than thirty years.&lt;ref name=Star19680826&gt;{{Cite news|title=Damaschke honored Wednesday |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/848939// |newspaper=The Oneonta Star |date=August 26, 1968 |page=10 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014 }}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field and stadium are administered as public facilities within Oneonta's large [[Neahwa Park]].&lt;ref name=ParksDept&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oneonta.ny.us/sidebar-nav/parks-and-recreation/about-our-parks/ |title=Oneonta's Parks |author= |year=2014 |publisher=Oneonta Recreation Department |work=Oneonta.ny.us |accessdate=12 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610021149/http://www.oneonta.ny.us/sidebar-nav/parks-and-recreation/about-our-parks |archivedate=10 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was the longtime home of the area's [[minor league]] baseball team, the [[Oneonta Tigers|Oneonta Red Sox]] (1966), [[Oneonta Tigers|Oneonta Yankees]] (1967–1998), [[Oneonta Tigers]] (1999–2009). The field has also regularly hosted the [[Oneonta Indians]] football team, the Oneonta United soccer team, and the [[Hartwick College]] baseball team.&lt;ref name=Star19700623/&gt; It is currently the home field of the [[Oneonta Outlaws]], a [[List of collegiate summer baseball leagues|collegiate summer]] baseball team in the [[New York Collegiate Baseball League]].&lt;ref name=ParksDept/&gt;

A few games were staged here in late May of 1969 by the [[Syracuse Chiefs]] of the [[International League]] while their home field [[MacArthur Stadium]] was being repaired after a fire.

The '''Estadio Libertadores de América''' is a [[stadium]] located in [[Avellaneda]], [[Buenos Aires Province]].
It is home to the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Association football|football]] club [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]]. The stadium was officially named only as recently as 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://encolas.blogspot.com/2005/10/estaba-en-cola-pero-partir-de-hoy.html Estaba en cola... pero a partir de hoy...] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been previously known simply as ''Estadio de Independiente'' or ''La Doble Visera de Cemento'' ("The double [[cement]] visor") because of the two rooves overhanging the spectators.

The original stadium, located at Ricardo Bochini 751/83, was built in 1928 and had a capacity of 52,823 with 27,863 seats. ''La Doble Visera'', as it was popularly known, was the first cement stadium built in [[South America]], and would host all international finals Independiente played as local team (7 of the [[Copa Libertadores]], 3 of the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]], 2 of the [[Supercopa Sudamericana]] and 2 of the [[Interamerican Cup|Copa Interamericana]]) as well as many Argentina international matches, mostly occurring in the 1930s and 1940s.

==Reconstruction==

In December 2006 the stadium was shuttered, and demolished the following year. The rebuilt stadium was inaugurated on October 28, 2009, in a match against [[Colón de Santa Fe]] of the [[Argentine First Division]] championship ([[2009–10 Primera División Argentina|Apertura 2009]]).
The new, European-style stadium has a capacity of roughly 48,069 seats.  It also features large digital screens, a restaurant with panoramic view of the pitch, a club museum, offices and conferential facilities, and a shopping centre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://clubaindependiente.com/es/institucion/estadio Website for the new stadium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214054359/https://clubaindependiente.com/es/institucion/estadio |date=2014-02-14 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4400">The '''International Women's Boxing Hall of Fame''' (IWBHF) is a sports hall of fame located in [[Vancouver, Washington]]. It is dedicated to [[women's boxing]], and was started by [[Sue TL Fox ]]. The Hall of Fame has a peculiar form of selecting candidates in that it allows fans to nominate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwbhf.com/form2017.htm|title=Nomination Form|work=wban.net|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terri Moss]], a 2015 inductee, says that the IWBHF helps show women's accomplishments in the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/fl-golden-gloves-finals-iwbhf-induction-0712-20150711-story.html|title = Women's Boxing Hall of Fame inducts Ali, 7 others|last = Fenelon|first = Michelle|date = 11 July 2015|work = Sun Sentinel|access-date = 31 December 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their primary mission is to "call honorary attention to those professional female boxers (now retired) along with men and women whose contributions to the sport and its athletes, from outside the ring, have been instrumental in growing female boxing."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iwbhf.com/induction.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The International Women's Boxing Hall of Fame first surged as an idea in 2013, by Sue TL Fox, the Founder and Creator of Women Boxing Archive Network [WBAN]. That year the WBAN, a website dedicated to women's boxing exclusively, announced that steps were being taken to open the Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwbhf.com/about.htm|title=About the IWBHF|work=wban.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hall of Fame's first inductee class was announced in April, 2014, and its first induction ceremony took place on July 11, 2014, and was attended by  among others, [[Claressa Shields]], women's boxing gold medalist at the 2012 London Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwbhf.com/news071014inaugural-2014-induction-ceremony.htm|title=History-First International Women's Boxing Hall of Fame 2014 Inaugural Induction Ceremony|work=iwbhf.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Izod Corporation''' (officially stylized as '''IZOD''') is a mid-range [[clothing]] [[company]] that produces [[smart casual|dressy-casual]] clothing, sportswear for men, as well as footwear and accessories. It is part of [[PVH (company)|PVH]], forming part of its Heritage Brands division along with Van Heusen, [[The Arrow Collar Man|Arrow]], Warner's, Olga, and [[Speedo]] (the latter licensed in perpetuity from Speedo International in North America only). It is perhaps best known for its short-sleeved [[Piqué (weaving)|piqué]] [[polo shirt]], formerly produced by [[Lacoste]] and featuring the Lacoste crocodile on the left breast, now replaced with an embroidered (or screen-printed on some golfwear) crest. One variation is the "IZ" patch instead of crest. Other Izod classics include the [[Harrington jacket]] G-9 model, also v-neck and [[cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]] sweaters.  Today, the Izod brand competes most directly with the similarly-priced Chaps brand owned by [[Ralph Lauren Corporation]], while competing more indirectly on the lower end with [[U.S. Polo Assn.]] and on the higher end with [[Nautica (clothing company)|Nautica]].  

== History ==

In the late 1930s, [[Vincent dePaul Draddy]], an [[American people|American]] [[businessman]] employed by David Crystal Co., needed a strong name to associate with his quality merchandise for [[menswear]]. While vacationing with his family in [[London]], he encountered ''Jack Izod's'' tailoring boutique. Izod (himself a well-respected tailor) produced bespoke shirts and created the [[windsor knot|Windsor tie-knot]] for [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], but was ready to retire, and accepted Draddy's offer to purchase the rights to his distinctive name. The ''A.J. Izod of London'' clothing company was introduced to the United States in 1938.

=== Izod Lacoste ===
Izod of London would become most notable for its pairing with the [[Lacoste]] shirt company from 1952 to 1993. Vincent Draddy began to license the Lacoste shirt to add prestige to the Izod line, but he could not find a market for the then-expensive $8.00 retail price (approximately {{Inflation|US|8.00|1952|fmt=eq}}). After Draddy began giving the shirts away to his famous friends, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Bing Crosby]], Daniel Platt, and [[John F. Kennedy]], the shirts soon became popular with department stores. "Izod of London" became a brand known simply as "Izod Lacoste". While the shirts were equally Izod and Lacoste, they became abbreviated and popularized as "Izod" shirts (which led to the ongoing misunderstanding that the famous "Crocodile" is the "Izod" trademark).

=== Growth ===
In 1964, Bernard Lacoste took over the management of the company. Significant company growth was seen under Bernard's management. When he became president, around 300,000 Izod Lacoste products were sold annually. The Izod Lacoste brand reached its height of popularity in the US during the late 1970s and became the signature 1980s "preppy" wardrobe item, mentioned in ''[[The Official Preppy Handbook]]''. The company also began to introduce other products into their line including shorts, perfume, optical and sunglasses, tennis shoes, deck shoes, walking shoes, watches, and various leather goods.

In 1977, [[Le Tigre Clothing]] was founded in an attempt to directly compete with Izod Lacoste in the US market, selling a similar array of apparel, but featuring a tiger in place of the signature Lacoste crocodile. Also, during this period Izod's parent, Crystal Brands, came under the management of General Mills, and purchased the [[Gant U.S.A.]] brand.

=== Separation ===
During the early 1990s, Izod Lacoste struggled to maintain the market dominance it had enjoyed in previous decades.  The initial reaction from Crystal Brands was to separate the two names and target two groups of customers at once; "Izod" was re-introduced as moderate pricepoint apparel in department stores, while Lacoste was renamed "Lacoste Chemise", and re-positioned as a luxury lifestyle brand. Eventually this tactic did not provide the financial gain Crystal had hoped and the license partnering ended in 1993.  Sportloisirs S.A. purchased the Lacoste brand entirely in 1993, while Izod was sold to [[Phillips-Van Heusen|Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation]] in 1995.

PVH repositioned and restored some of Izod's previous relevance while introducing a number of products lines and brands. Complete with an Izod "crest" logo, or patch. In addition to its sportswear, Izod designs a full range of [[men's suit]]s, shirts, [[necktie]]s, shoes, [[outerwear]] and fragrances, and continues to produce its famous polo shirts. Currently, within the PVH corp. the Izod branded shirt has become part of the biggest shirt company in the United States.

=== Recent history ===
From 2003 to 2007, PVH formed a licensing deal with [[Kellwood Company]] to produce Izod-branded women's clothing.  Production of the women's line was brought in-house in 2007 until its discontinuation in 2015.

On January 7, 2015 parent company Phillips-Van Heusen announced that it would be closing all 120 Izod retail outlets due to an increasing competitive environment driven by more premium brands in the outlet retail channel. This move will not affect Izod's growing wholesale business to department stores and other retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/pvh-to-shut-izods-retail-business-2015-01-07-16911119 | title=PVH to shut Izod's retail business}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coinciding with the closure of the retail outlets, in 2015 the women's line was discontinued.

In Spring 2016, Izod introduced the Advantage Polo, a new take on their traditional piqué polo featuring a cotton/polyester blend with natural stretch, moisture wicking fabric, and UPF-15 sun protection.  The Advantage brand was later expanded to include other products with stretch fabric such as fleece sweatshirts and button-down shirts.

On June 7, 2017, parent company PVH announced that it has reached a licensing agreement with Adjmi Apparel Group subsidiary Sports Products of America to manufacture women's sportswear, golfwear, and activewear under the Izod brand beginning February 2018, thus signifying IZOD's return to the women's clothing market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170607005158/en/PVH-Corp.-Announces-Licensing-Agreement-Sports-Products |title=PVH Corp. Announces Licensing Agreement with Sports Products of America for IZOD Women’s Sportswear &amp; Activewear  |website=[[Business Wire]] |publication-date=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 28, 2018, it was announced that PVH would expand the Izod brand to Europe starting with the Fall/Winter 2018 collection, initially in [[Spain]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180828005132/en/PVH-Corp.-Expands-Global-Footprint-Launch-Iconic |title=PVH Corp. Expands Global Footprint, with Launch of Iconic American Brand IZOD in Europe |website=[[Business Wire]] |publication-date=August 28, 2018 |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; PVH claims the launch of the Izod brand should fill in the void between fast-fashion labels and premium American brands.

==Brands==
Since Izod's first brand, ''Izod'', was launched in 1938, it has grown considerably to include a variety of essential, performance, and luxury brands.

===Current===
*'''Izod (formerly Izod Classix)''': Izod's original brand for men and women. This line spans from tailored clothing, traditional cotton polo shirts in [[Piqué (weaving)|piqué]] and [[Jersey (fabric)|interlock]] knits, shoes, fragrances, leather goods, underwear, neckwear, eyewear, and watches.

The second PerformX line was a line of dress shirts featuring non-iron stretch fabric; discontinued in 2018.  The PerformX name is currently used for a line of prescription eyewear.
*'''Izod Golf''': The official golf line of Izod, including shirts, shorts, and pants, available for both men and women.

===Former===
*'''Izod Luxury Sports''': Izod's 'red label' premium sportswear brand for men, with premium fabrics and finer attention to detail; such as name embroidery. As with the 'blue label' Luxury Sports spans from tailored clothing, sportswear, activewear, and accessories, to leather goods. Once available exclusively at [[Macy's]] stores, discontinued in 2014.

== Sports sponsorships ==
The former Continental Airlines Arena, in [[New Jersey]], [[United States]] was renamed the [[Izod Center]] as of October 31, 2007, the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[New Jersey Nets]]' [[2007-08 NBA season|season]] opener. The company paid $1.4 million per annum for the [[naming rights]] during the first two years of the agreement, while the Nets remained tenants, which dropped to $750,000 per year for the balance of the five-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/05/sports/basketball/05arena.html "Fashionable New Name for Arena"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 5, 2007. Accessed October 11, 2007. "On Oct. 31, when the Nets open their season against the Chicago Bulls, the Meadowlands arena named for Continental Airlines for 12 years will be rechristened the Izod Center. Izod will pay $1.4 million a year in cash for the first two years of the five-year agreement, which will be cut to $750,000 annually in 2009 when the Nets are expected to move to [[Brooklyn]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Izod became the official apparel provider of the [[IndyCar Series]] and [[Firestone Indy Lights|Firestone Indy Lights Series]]. Izod produces T-shirts, polos, pullovers, hats, and umbrellas for league and team officials and the general public.

In 2010 Izod became the official title sponsor of the Izod IndyCar Series, a deal worth $10 million a year for 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indystar.com/article/20091102/SPORTS0107/311020016/IndyCar+lands+title+sponsor+--+Izod IndyCar lands Title Sponsor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106082425/http://www.indystar.com/article/20091102/SPORTS0107/311020016/IndyCar%2Blands%2Btitle%2Bsponsor%2B--%2BIzod |date=2009-11-06 }}, indystar.com, November 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Izod discontinued its sponsorship in [[2014 IndyCar Series season|2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibj.com/izod-dropping-indycar-series-sponsorship/PARAMS/article/43767|title=Izod dropping IndyCar Series sponsorship|newspaper=[[Indianapolis Business Journal]]|date=September 27, 2013|accessdate=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advertising campaigns ==
In fall 2016 leading up to the [[2016 United States Presidential Election]], Izod partnered with Internet sensation Ken Bone, who became notable for his red Izod sweater.&lt;ref name="kenbone"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://fortune.com/2016/10/20/ken-bone-izod-partnership/ |title=Izod Just Gave Ken Bone His 16th Minute of Fame |date=October 20, 2016 |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 2017 and again in spring 2018, Izod has partnered with American tennis duo the [[Bryan brothers]] to promote the spring/summer collections.&lt;ref name="bryanbrothers"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170309005732/en/IZOD-Signs-Multi-Year-Marketing-Partnership-16x-Grand |title=IZOD Signs Multi-Year Marketing Partnership with 16x Grand Slam Champs, the Bryan Brothers  |date=March 9, 2017 |work=[[Business Wire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2018, Izod partnered with [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] and [[Saturday Night Live]] comedian [[Colin Jost]] to promote the fall/winter 2018 collection; this ad campaign became notable for poking fun at advertising clichés in menswear.&lt;ref name="fall2018"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://people.com/style/aaron-rodgers-colin-jost-izod-commerical/ |title=Aaron Rodgers and Colin Jost Try to One-Up Each Other in IZOD's Hilarious New Commercial |date=September 5, 2018 |work=[[People (magazine)|People Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Officers Club Services Ground''' is a [[cricket]] ground in Fleet Road, [[Aldershot]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]].  Aldershot had been a small village until 1853, but was transformed following the purchase of 25,000 [[acre]]s of land by the [[War Office]] for military training.&lt;ref name="PRO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/ground/56741.html|title=Ground profile: Officers Club Services Ground|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the following two decades Aldershot was transformed into a [[Garrison#British garrison|garrison town]], by 1874 a number of cricket grounds, including the [[Military officers' club|Officers Club]] Services Ground, had been constructed for use by the various regiments garrisoned there.&lt;ref name="PRO"/&gt;

==History==
The first recorded match to have been played there was in 1861 between the Knickerbockers and [[I Zingari]].  Over the coming decade the ground was used by the Aldershot Division in matches primarily against I Zingari and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], though not exclusively as some matches were against other parts of the armed forces.&lt;ref name="OTH"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/275_misc.html|title=Other matches played on Officers Club Services Ground, Aldershot|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[cricket pavilion|pavilion]] was built in 1887.&lt;ref name="PRO"/&gt;  [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] first played [[first-class cricket]] there in the [[1905 County Championship]] against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]],&lt;ref name="FCM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/275_f.html|title=First-Class Matches played on Officers Club Services Ground, Aldershot|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Hampshire losing this match by 7 wickets.&lt;ref name="SURREY"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/6/6700.html|title=Hampshire v Surrey, 1905 County Championship|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hampshire used the ground twice more as a venue before [[World War I]], playing Surrey in 1906 and [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in 1910.  This season also saw its first-class use by an armed services team, when a combined Army and Navy team played a combined [[Oxford and Cambridge Universities cricket team|Oxford and Cambridge Universities]] team, which marked the final first-class match played there before World War I.&lt;ref name="FCM"/&gt;  First-class cricket did not return immediately after the war, the first match of note came in May 1932 when the [[British Army cricket team|Army]] played the touring [[India national cricket team|Indians]] in a two-day non-first-class match, which was abandoned without a ball bowled.&lt;ref name="OTH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/105/105828.html|title=Army v Indians, 1932|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year in June, first-class cricket returned to the ground when the Army played the touring [[South American cricket team in England in 1932|South Americans]], which the Army won by 5 wickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/14/14302.html|title=Army v South Americans, 1932|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The following season the Army played another first-class match against the touring [[West Indies cricket team|West Indians]], which ended in a draw.  Of note was the Army's opening partnership of 286 in their first-innings between [[Reginald Hudson]] and [[Cyril Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/14/14835.html|title=Army v West Indians, 1933|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the final first-class match held there before [[World War II]],&lt;ref name="FCM"/&gt; despite visits from the touring [[Australia national cricket team|Australians]] in 1934 and 1938, and from the West Indians in 1939, none of which were rated first-class.&lt;ref name="OTH"/&gt;  A new pavilion was constructed to replace the original in 1936 and was opened by [[John Francis Gathorne-Hardy|General Sir John Francis Gathorne-Hardy]].&lt;ref name="PRO"/&gt;

Minor matches between various armed services teams and the [[Oxford University Authentics]] were played during the war. Following the end of the war, Hampshire returned to playing first-class cricket at the ground,&lt;ref name="FCM"/&gt; playing two matches in 1948 against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]], which was drawn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18502.html|title=Hampshire v Cambridge University, 1948|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Combined Services cricket team|Combined Services]], which Hampshire won by an innings and 60 runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18511.html|title=Hampshire v Combined Services, 1948|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These matches were the last first-class matches Hampshire would play there.  First-class cricket wouldn't return until 1964, when the final first-class held there was played between the Combined Services and [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="FCM"/&gt;  Both the Army and the Combined Services continued to play at the ground after this, doing so to this day.&lt;ref name="OTH"/&gt;  More recently, a [[Women's Twenty20 cricket|Women's Twenty20 International]] was played there in 2011 between [[India women's cricket team|India Women]] and [[New Zealand women's cricket team|New Zealand Women]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/275_witt.html|title=Women's International Twenty-20 Matches played on Officers Club Services Ground, Aldershot|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which India Women won by 3 wickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/345/345867.html|title=India Women v New Zealand Women, 2011|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Penshurst Park Cricket Ground''', also known as the '''Earl of Leicester's Park''', is a [[cricket]] ground at [[Penshurst]] in [[Kent]]. It is one of the oldest cricket venues in England. Part of the [[Penshurst Place]] estate, it hosted its first recorded match in 1724.

==History==
Penshurst Park is known to have been the venue for four important matches played between 1724 and 1729. It is first recorded in 1724 for a match involving a combined the [[Penshurst, Tonbridge &amp; Wadhurst cricket team]] against [[Dartford Cricket Club]].&lt;ref&gt;McCann T (2004) ''Sussex Cricket in the Eighteenth Century'', p. 18. Sussex Record Society.&lt;/ref&gt; and then in the [[1728 English cricket season]] when it was used for two matches organised by [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent patron]] [[Edwin Stead]] against teams led by the [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond|2nd Duke of Richmond]] and [[Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet|Sir William Gage]]. In 1729, Stead used it as his home venue for another match against Sir William Gage's XI.

A number of matches were played by a Penshurst club in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name=ca&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/2816_misc.html Other matches played on Penshurst Park, Penshurst], CricketArchive. Retrieved 2017-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The ground is the home of Penshurst Cricket Club.&lt;ref name=pcc&gt;[http://www.imaginecricket.com/cricket-clubs/penshurst-park-cc/ Penshurst Park Cricket Club].

'''Richard Newland''' (1713–1778) was an English [[cricket]]er in the mid-Georgian period who played for [[Slindon Cricket Club]] and [[Sussex county cricket teams|Sussex]] under the patronage of [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond]]. He also represented various [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] teams. Newland made 26 known appearances from 1741 to 1751: 18 in [[first-class cricket|first-class]] and 8 in [[single wicket]] matches.

==Family==
Born 1713, [[Slindon]], Sussex, two of his brothers, [[John Newland (cricketer)|John]] (born 1717) and [[Adam Newland|Adam]] (born 1719), played for Slindon but little is known of them apart from what appears in the match reports. The Newland brothers were the uncles of [[Richard Nyren]], who later became the team captain at [[Hambledon Club|Hambledon]]. Their sister Susan married Richard Nyren senior of Eartham, which is near Slindon.&lt;ref name=TJM/&gt;

The earliest recorded mention of the Newland brothers is in a letter dated Thursday 9 July 1741 from the [[Sarah Lennox, Duchess of Richmond and Lennox|Duchess of Richmond]] to [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond|her husband]]. She mentions a conversation with John Newland re a Slindon v East Dean match a week earlier at Long Down, near Eartham, Sussex.&lt;ref name=TJM&gt;[[Timothy J McCann]], ''Sussex Cricket in the Eighteenth Century'', Sussex Record Society, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In the 1740s, Richard Newland was arguably "the most famous player in England".&lt;ref name="HSA31"&gt;Altham, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; He was a batting all-rounder and the earliest known left-handed player in cricket history. His bowling style and pace are unknown but, like all bowlers during his career, he used the [[Underarm bowling|underarm]] style. He excelled at both [[single wicket]] and the eleven-a-side game.

Newland's career must have begun in the 1730s but there is no mention of him in the sources during that decade. He relied for his opportunities on the 2nd Duke of Richmond, who patronised the Slindon team which eventually became representative of Sussex as a county. This was emphasised in a noted match against Surrey at Merrow Down in September 1741 when, according to Richmond's letters, "poor little Slyndon" beat Surrey "almost in 1 innings".

There are references in 1742 to "the Sussex Man from Slending" and "the noted bowler from Slendon", although it is not certain that Richard Newland was one or both of these great players. At the end of the 1742 season, Slindon played two matches against [[London Cricket Club|London]] at the [[Artillery Ground]] but lost them both, the second by a huge margin. In the first, several wagers were laid that one Slindon batsman, almost certainly Richard Newland, would obtain forty runs from his own bat – a feat he failed to perform.

In July 1743, the six players in a threes match between All-England and Kent at the Artillery Ground were stated to be "the best in England". Newland captained All-England, but Kent won by 2 runs before a crowd estimated at 10,000.

By 1744, Newland had begun a rivalry with [[Robert Colchin]] (''aka'' Long Robin), who organised a number of games between his own team and one picked by Newland. Slindon defeated London in June 1744 by 55 runs, its team including Newland, his brother Adam and two other noted Sussex players [[Edward Aburrow senior|Aburrow]] and [[Ridgeway (Sussex cricketer)|Ridgeway]]. However, the team contained given men including the great [[Addington Cricket Club|Addington]] player [[Joe Harris (cricketer)|Joe Harris]]. The match is now famous because Richmond created what has become the world's oldest surviving [[scoring (cricket)|scorecard]].

Two weeks later, Newland played for [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] against [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] at the [[Artillery Ground]].&lt;ref name=S&amp;B&gt;[[Arthur Haygarth]], ''Scores &amp; Biographies, Volume 1 (1744–1826)'', Lillywhite, 1862&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/0/1.html CricketArchive – match scorecard]. Retrieved on 29 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Cricket, An Heroic Poem'' (1745) by [[James Love (poet)|James Love]], which commemorated the match, Newland is described as "the champion", a sobriquet later applied to [[W G Grace]]. Kent captain [[Lord John Sackville]] is reported to have held a remarkable catch in the second innings to dismiss Newland, who was the top scorer in the match with 18* and 15.

After Slindon beat London again in September 1744, Richmond issued the audacious "Slindon Challenge" to play "any parish in England". The only teams to accept were Addington, which featured [[Tom Faulkner]] and the Harris brothers, and [[Bromley Cricket Club|Bromley]], famous for Colchin, Durling and the Bryant brothers. Sadly, details of the two challenge matches are lost. It is believed they were both rained off.

There are few mentions of Slindon in 1745 or 1746 and Newland can be found playing for All-England or leading his own team, usually in opposition to Colchin's team. In July 1745, he scored what was then a massive 88 for All-England against Kent at the Artillery Ground. It is not absolutely certain that he did this in one innings and it may have been his match total but, giving him the benefit of the doubt, it is the highest individual innings recorded during cricket's pioneering period (i.e., to 1763).

By 1747, [[single wicket]] had superseded the 11-a-side version as the most popular form of cricket and the 1748 season was the halcyon days of single wicket. Richmond made the most of it and his Slindon fives and threes were a regular feature of the great matches at the Artillery Ground. However, Newland did not always captain his team in 1747. There was a threes match in September in which he was again opposed by his rival Colchin, but the captaincy of his side had been given to [[Stephen Dingate]], who was a regular fixture in Richmond's teams at this time. This could be evidence that Newland was past his best. In July 1747, he seems to be reconciled with Colchin because for the first time they played on the same side but, significantly, it was Long Robin's XI that Newland was playing for. In 1749, Newland was a member of an All-England team captained by Colchin.

Newland's last known appearances were in 1751, the year after Colchin and then Richmond had died. He played in two matches for All-England against Kent and was on the winning team both times. Now 38, it can be assumed that, like Sussex cricket in general after the death of Richmond, he faded from the scene. It is likely that he retired to Slindon where he farmed his land and taught his nephew [[Richard Nyren]] to play cricket. He died in 1778.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3676">'''Romantic chess''' was the style of [[chess]] prevalent from the late 15th century until the 1880s. Chess games of this period emphasized more on quick, tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic planning.&lt;ref name="Shenk, 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=David Shenk |title=The Immortal Game: A History of Chess |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lWf71WaEnLgC&amp;pg=PT99 |year=2007 |publisher=Knopf Doubleday |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantic era of play was followed by the Scientific, [[Hypermodernism (chess)|Hypermodern]], and New Dynamism eras.&lt;ref name="Shenk, 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spielman, Rudolph ''The Art of Sacrifice in Chess'' Dover Chess 2011 {{ISBN|0-486-28449-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games during this era generally consisted of 1.e4 openings such as the [[King's Gambit]] and [[Giuoco Piano]]. Queen side pawn openings were not popular and seldom played. The Romantic era is generally considered to have ended with the [[Vienna 1873 chess tournament|1873 Vienna tournament]] where [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] popularized {{chessgloss|positional play}} and the {{chessgloss|closed game}}.&lt;ref&gt;Landsberger, Kurt ''William Steinitz, Chess Champion'' [[McFarland &amp; Company]] 1992 {{ISBN|0-89950-758-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This domination ushered in a new age of chess known as the "[[School of chess#Classical school|Modern]]", or Classical school, which would last until the 1930s when [[Hypermodernism (chess)|hypermodernism]] began to become popular.

The Romantic era is generally considered to have begun with [[Alexander McDonnell]] and [[Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais]], the two dominant chess players in the 1830s. The 1840s was dominated by [[Howard Staunton]], and other leading players of the era included [[Adolf Anderssen]], [[Daniel Harrwitz]], [[Henry Bird (chess player)|Henry Bird]], [[Louis Paulsen]], and [[Paul Morphy]].

Despite the Romantic era's reputation for dashing tactical play and combinations, positional play and closed games were not at all unknown during this time; they featured prominently in the [[London 1851 chess tournament|London tournament of 1851]], widely considered the first true chess tournament. Paul Morphy often complained about "dull chess" and criticized the [[Sicilian Defense]] and queen pawn openings for leading to this sort of game. Morphy included a stipulation in his matches that at least half the games had to begin with a [[Open Game|1.e4 e5 opening]].

During the 1930s, [[Nazi Germany]] co-opted chess as a political tool and to that end circulated propaganda alleging that the age of Romantic chess, dominated by dashing Aryan players such as Morphy and Anderssen, had been derailed by "cowardly, stingy" positional chess exemplified by Jewish players like Steinitz, [[Emanuel Lasker]], and others.

The [[Romantic era]] in the arts (notably classical music and poetry) was roughly analogous to the chess world. Existing as time contemporaries with each other, the arts were focused on emotional expression more than technical mastery. This would come to an end towards the end of the 19th century as evolution in the arts ([[Impressionist music]] and [[Symbolist poetry]]) aligned closely time-wise with Steinitz' emergence as the new stylistic force in the chess world.  Some notable chess masters have argued that chess is an art form in addition to a science.&lt;ref&gt;CHESS AS AN ART FORM Br J Aesthet (1993) 33(1): 59-66&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Swiss [[Athlete of the Year|Sports Personality of the Year]]''' was originally chosen annually from 1950 by the [[Swiss]] newspaper ''Sport''{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}. As the newspaper was discontinued in the 1990s, the winners are now chosen by Swiss [[sports journalism|journalists]] and TV viewers. Their results count for 50% each towards the final result and the method is debatable, since journalists' and viewers' opinions may be very different. In 2009 [[Roger Federer]] had a large lead among voters working in the media, but viewers voted for [[Didier Cuche]], giving him the awards. Even Cuche was surprised and in his speech he apologized to Federer, saying "I hope he's not too angry..." Federer didn't really bother, but he did the first time this happened. In 2005 spectators voted for [[Thomas Lüthi]], after media boosted Federer on top place.

Roger Federer has won this award a record seven times (2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2012, 2014, and 2017).

'''''The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings''''' is a 1976 [[sports]] [[comedy film]] about a team of  enterprising ex-[[Negro League baseball]] players in the era of [[racial segregation]]. Loosely based upon William Brashler's novel of the same name, it starred [[Billy Dee Williams]], [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Richard Pryor]]. Directed by [[John Badham]],&lt;ref name="The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/68787/Bingo-Long-Traveling-All-Stars-And-Motor-Kings-The/|title=The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings|work=TCM database|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the movie was produced by [[Berry Gordy]] for [[Motown Productions]] and [[Rob Cohen]] for [[Universal Pictures]], and released by Universal on July 16, 1976.

The film was a box office success, grossing $33 million on a $9 million budget. The film received a good reception and has gained a [[cult following]].

==Plot==

Tired of being treated like a slave by team owner Sallison Potter ([[Ted Ross]]), charismatic star pitcher Bingo Long (Billy Dee Williams) steals a bunch of Negro League players away from their teams, including catcher/slugger Leon Carter (James Earl Jones) and Charlie Snow (Richard Pryor), a player forever scheming to break into the segregated [[Major League Baseball]] of the 1930s by masquerading as first a Cuban ("Carlos Nevada"), then a Native American ("Chief Takahoma").  They take to the road, barnstorming through small Midwestern towns, playing the local teams to make ends meet.  One of the opposing players, 'Esquire' Joe Calloway ([[Stan Shaw]]), is so good that they recruit him.

Bingo's team becomes so outlandishly entertaining and successful, it begins to cut into the attendance of the established Negro League teams.  Finally, Bingo's nemesis Potter is forced to propose a winner-take-all game: if Bingo's team can beat a bunch of all-stars, it can join the league, but if it loses, the players will return to their old teams.  Potter has two of his goons kidnap Leon prior to the game as insurance, but he escapes and is key to his side's victory.

As it turns out, there is a Major League scout in the audience. After the game, he offers Esquire Joe the chance to break the color barrier; with Bingo's blessing, he accepts.  Leon glumly foresees the decline of the Negro League as more players follow Esquire Joe's lead, but Bingo, ever the optimist, cheers him up by describing the wild promotional stunts he intends to stage to bring in the paying customers.

==Negro League tie-ins==
Some characters and situations are loosely based upon real-life people and incidents. Badham grew up in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] and was familiar with the [[Birmingham Black Barons]], who shared [[Rickwood Field]] with the white [[Birmingham Barons]].&lt;ref&gt;Badham, John (November 19, 2009) "[http://www.trailersfromhell.com/trailers/480 John Badham on 'The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings']." Trailers from Hell! – accessed July 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Bingo Long is based on former Black Baron [[Satchel Paige|Leroy "Satchel" Paige]]. Early in his career, Paige would call in his outfield while leading in the ninth inning against an amateur or semi-pro team and strike out the side. Bingo did a similar stunt in this movie. Leon Carter is a [[Josh Gibson]]-like power hitter, even playing the same position (catcher). "Esquire" Joe Calloway is an amalgam of another Black Baron, [[Willie Mays]] (in personality, talent, and fielding position) and [[Jackie Robinson]] (as being signed by a white team at the film's end).

The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings were loosely based on the [[Indianapolis Clowns]] and other barnstorming Negro baseball teams, who likewise engaged in [[Harlem Globetrotters]]-like clowning routines.

==Production==
{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2018}}
[[Luther Williams Field]] in [[Macon, Georgia]] was used for filming as the Negro League ballpark.  Luther Williams Field was home to the [[Macon Music]], a [[minor league]] team in the independent [[South Coast League]].  Additional ballpark scenes were shot at Morgan Field in Macon, a Pony and Colt League Youth Baseball field, [[Grayson Stadium]] in [[Savannah, Georgia]], home of the [[Savannah Sand Gnats]] of the Class A [[South Atlantic League]], and Wallace Field in Crawford County, Georgia. Exterior scenes set in St. Louis residential neighborhoods were also filmed in Savannah.  Scenes set in rural communities were filmed in [[Talbotton, Georgia]] and various small towns around Macon, including [[Monticello, Georgia]].  Some ballplayers were played by actual former athletes, including former members of the [[Indianapolis Clowns]], who performed various stunts shown in the film.

[[Steven Spielberg]] originally wanted to have a hand in producing the movie until the success of his film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' got his full attention.

==Reception==

'''Vigoro''' is a team sport, played mainly by women in [[Sport in Australia|Australia]], that originally combined elements of [[cricket]] and [[tennis]], although in its current form it may be more similar to cricket and [[baseball]].&lt;ref name = BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28237387|title=Vigoro: The Edwardian attempt to merge tennis and cricket|date=22 July 2014|accessdate=22 July 2014|author=Justin Parkinson|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The game was invented in 1901 by Englishman John George Grant.{{efn|name=grosvenor|In early publications on the game the Hon. Algernon Grosvenor is also mentioned as inventor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Playing at Vigoro|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=WC19010816.2.4|work=Wanganui Chronicle|date=16 August 1901|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name = BBC /&gt; In the original version tennis rackets were used and the [[wicket]] consisted of six stumps. On 17 October 1902, a match was played before the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC committee]] at [[Lord's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pars from London|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000412/19020930/048/0003|work=Northants Evening Telegraph|publisher=British Newspaper Archive|date=30 September 1902|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; An eleven led by [[real tennis]] and rackets player [[Eustace Miles]], and including Wimbledon champions [[Laurence Doherty|Laurence]] and [[Reginald Doherty]], defeated the opposition, led by [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] batsman [[Bobby Abel]]. Miles' team led after the first innings by 73 to 18 runs and won by an innings after Abel's team made only 39 runs in the second innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Strange Game of "Vigoro"|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000273/19021018/020/0006|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|publisher=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|date=18 October 1902|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month the game was also played at [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rival to cricket|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000582/19021011/098/0005|work=Dundee Evening Post|publisher=British Newspaper Archive|date=11 October 1902|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games were also played that year, and in 1903, at London's [[Queen's Club]].&lt;ref name = BBC /&gt; In England interest in the game  died down after a few years but it managed to gain a foothold in Australia where it was introduced during [[World War]] I. A key figure in the promotion of the game in Australia was Ettie Dodge, who was President (1919–66) of the New South Wales Women's Vigoro Association and foundation president (1932–66) of the All Australian [Vigoro] Association. Ettie's husband had met John George Grant in [[England]]. When the game was introduced to [[New South Wales]] schools in the 1920s, Dodge &amp; Co. began selling vigoro equipment. Grant died in 1927 and bequeathed the trademark and copyright of the game to Ettie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140016b.htm "Ettie Dodge (1885 - 1973)"] by Anne-Marie Gaudry, ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 14, 1996, retrieved (from online edition) 20 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Vigoro is played on a pitch which shall be no shorter than 17.68 m [58'],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.qldvigoro.com.au/sites/default/files/files/uploads/All%20Australian%20Vigoro%20Rules%20October%202006.pdf]'', All Australian Vigoro Rules October 2006.pdf, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; which is slightly shorter in length than a cricket pitch. The balls are much lighter than those for cricket, and the bat has a different shape with a long handle resembling the shape of a paddle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vigoro.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=28 NSW Vigoro Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821021038/http://www.vigoro.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=28 |date=21 August 2006 }} "About us" section, retrieved 20 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Lucy|title=Vigoro is a strategic sport|url=https://www.dailymercury.com.au/news/vigoro-is-a-strategic-sport/2798549/|accessdate=7 April 2018|publisher=Daily Mercury|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two teams of 12 players which will bat and field two innings each (except in the event that a team wins with an innings in hand). The aim of the game is for a team to score more runs than the opposition team.

There are no overs and the batsmen bat from one end only. Two bowlers bowl alternately and can incorporate any type of "throwing" action as long as the ball is released above the shoulder (i.e. not underarm).

If the ball is hit forward of the crease, the batter must run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/local/videos/2013/03/22/3721875.htm ABC Northern Tasmania] "All Australian Vigoro Titles", retrieved 9 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A run is completed each time both batters safely make it to the crease at the opposite end of the pitch. Fours and sixes also apply where the batter hits the ball past the boundary markers. In addition to shots made off the bat, byes and leg-byes add to the team's score.

Players may be dismissed by the same methods as in [[Laws of cricket#Ways to get out|cricket]] – [[bowled]], [[caught (cricket)|caught]], [[run out]], [[stumped]], [[leg before wicket]], [[hit wicket]], [[Handled the ball|handled ball]] and [[hit the ball twice]].

'''Water polo''' is a [[competitive sport|competitive]] [[team sport]] played in the water between two teams. The game consists of four quarters in which the two teams attempt to score goals by throwing the [[water polo ball|ball]] into the opposing team's [[goal (sport)|goal]]. The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match. Each team is made up of six field players and one [[goalkeeper (water polo)|goalkeeper]]. Except for the goalkeeper, players participate in both offensive and defensive roles. Water polo is typically played in an all-deep [[swimming pool|pool]] meaning that players cannot touch the bottom.

A game of water polo consists of the players [[swimming]] to move about the pool, [[treading water]] (often using the [[eggbeater kick]] technique), passing the ball and shooting at goal. [[Teamwork]], tactical thinking and [[game awareness]] are also highly important aspects in a game of water polo. Water polo is a highly physical and demanding sport and has frequently been cited as one of the toughest sports to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martinez |first1=Vanesa |title=The five toughest  sports at the Olympics |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/the-five-toughest-sports-at-the-olympics-1.2751633 |accessdate=27 September 2018 |work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Renfro |first1=Kim |title=Olympic water polo is the most nightmarish sport in the world |url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/is-water-polo-hard-olympics-2016-8 |work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Journal of Physical Education |date=1958 |pages=139 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WntYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q= |accessdate=27 September 2018 |publisher=Physical Directors' Society of the Young Men's Christian Associations of North America |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special equipment for water polo includes a [[water polo ball]], a ball which floats on the water; numbered and coloured [[water polo cap|caps]]; and two goals, which either float in the water or are attached to the side of the pool.

The game is [[History of water polo|thought to have originated]] in Scotland in the late 19th century as a sort of "water rugby". [[William Wilson (aquatics)|William Wilson]] is thought to have developed the game during a similar period. The game thus developed with the formation of the London Water Polo League and has since expanded, becoming widely popular in various places around the world, including Europe, the United States, Brazil, China, Canada and Australia.

==History==
[[File:William Wilson ISHOF.jpg|thumb|William Wilson, Scottish aquatics pioneer and originator of the first [[rules of water polo]]]]
{{Main|History of water polo}}
The history of water polo as a team sport began as a demonstration of strength and swimming skill in late 19th century England and Scotland, where water sports and racing exhibitions were a feature of county fairs and festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |first=William |last=Henry |title=Water Polo |volume=28 |pages=384–385 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri28chisrich#page/384/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Barr  | first = David   | title = A Guide to Water Polo  | publisher = Sterling Publishing (London)  | year = 1981    | isbn = 978-0-8069-9164-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Men's water polo was among the first team sports introduced at the modern Olympic games in 1900.  Water polo is now popular in many countries around the world, notably Europe (particularly in Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, Russia, Italy, Greece and Spain), the United States, Canada and Australia. The present-day game involves teams of seven players (plus up to six substitutes), with a [[water polo ball]] similar in size to a soccer ball but constructed of air-tight nylon.

One of the earliest recorded viewings of water polo was conducted at the 4th Open Air Fete of the London Swimming Club, held at the Crystal Palace, London on 15 September 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Morning Post|date=13 September 1873|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another antecedent of the modern game of Water Polo was a game of water ‘handball’ played at [[Bournemouth]] on 13 July 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Bournemouth Visitors Directory 15 July 1876&lt;/ref&gt; This was a game between 12 members of the Premier Rowing Club, with goals being marked by four flags placed in the water near to the midpoint of Bournemouth Pier. The game started at 6:00 pm in the evening and lasted for 15 minutes (when the ball burst) watched by a large crowd; with plans being made for play on a larger scale the following week.

The [[rules of water polo]] were originally developed in the late nineteenth century in Great Britain by [[William Wilson (aquatics)|William Wilson]]. Wilson is believed to have been the First Baths Master of the [[Arlington Baths Club]] in Glasgow.  The first games of 'aquatic football' were played at the Arlington in the late 1800s (the Club was founded in 1870), with a [[water polo ball|ball]] constructed of India rubber. This "water rugby" came to be called "water polo" based on the English pronunciation of the [[Balti language|Balti]] word for ball, ''pulu''.&lt;ref&gt;12th FINA World Championship 2007: [http://melbourne2007.com.au/site/sections/sports/polo_history.html Classroom Resource] Retrieved 2007-09-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/polo polo. (n.d.).] Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Retrieved 20 September 2007, from Dictionary.com website&lt;/ref&gt; Early play allowed brute strength, wrestling and holding opposing players underwater to recover the ball. Players held underwater for lengthy periods usually surrendered possession. The goalie stood outside the playing area and defended the goal by jumping in on any opponent attempting to score by placing the ball on the deck.

==Rules==
{{Main|Rules of water polo}}
The [[rules of water polo]] cover the play, procedures, equipment and officiating of water polo. These rules are similar throughout the world, although slight variations to the rules do occur regionally and depending on the [[Sport governing body|governing body]]. Governing bodies of water polo include [[FINA]], the international governing organization for the rules; the [[NCAA]] rules, which govern the rules for collegiate matches in the United States; the [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] rules which govern the rules in high schools in the USA and the [[IOC]] rules which govern the rules at [[water polo at the Summer Olympics|Olympic events]].

== Positions ==
There are seven players in the water from each team at one time. There are six players that play out and one goalkeeper. Unlike most common team sports, there is little positional play; field players will often fill several positions throughout the game as situations demand. These positions usually consist of a center forward, a center back, the two wing players and the two drivers. Players who are skilled in all positions of offense or defense are called utility players. Utility players tend to come off of the bench, though this is not absolute. Certain body types are more suited for particular positions, and left-handed players are especially coveted on the right-hand side of the field, allowing teams to launch two-sided attacks.

===Offense===
The offensive positions include: one center forward (also called a "set", "hole-set", "center", "setter", "hole", or "2-meter man", located on or near the 2-meter, roughly in the center of the goal), two wings (located on or near the 2-meter, just outside of the goal posts, respectively), two drivers (also called "flats", located on or near the 5-meter, roughly at the goal posts, respectively), and one "point" (usually just behind the 5 meter, roughly in the center of the goal, respectively), positioned farthest from the goal. The wings, drivers and point are often called the perimeter players; while the hole-set directs play.  There is a typical numbering system for these positions in U.S. NCAA men's division one polo. Beginning with the offensive wing to the opposing goalie's right side is called one. The flat in a counter clockwise from one is called two. Moving along in the same direction the point player is three, the next flat is four, the final wing is five, and the hole set is called six. Additionally, the position in which a player is can give advantages based on a player's handedness, to improve a shooting or passing angle (for example, the right wing is often left handed).

The center sets up in front of the opposing team's goalie and scores the most individually (especially during lower level play where flats do not have the required strength to effectively shoot from outside or to penetrate and then pass to teammates like the [[point guard]] in basketball, or center midfield player in soccer). The center's position nearest to the goal allows explosive shots from close-range.

===Defense===
Defensive positions are often the same, but just switched from offence to defence. For example, the centre forward or hole set, who directs the attack on offence, on defence is known as "hole D" (also known as set guard, hole guard, hole check, pit defence or two-metre defence), and guards the opposing team's centre forward (also called the hole). Defence can be played [[man-to-man defence|man-to-man]] or in [[zone defence|zones]], such as a 2–4 (four defenders along the goal line). It can also be played as a combination of the two in what is known as an "[[The M-drop|M drop]]" defence, in which the point defender moves away ("sloughs off") his man into a zone in order to better defend the centre position. In this defence, the two wing defenders split the area furthest from the goal, allowing them a clearer lane for the counter-attack if their team recovers the ball.

===Goalkeeper===
{{Main|Goalkeeper (water polo)}}
[[File:Water polo-2.jpg|thumb|Goalkeeper blocking a shot]]
The [[goalkeeper]] has the main role in blocking shots against the goal as well as guiding and informing their defense of imposing threats and gaps in the defense. The goalkeeper usually begins the offensive play by passing the ball across the pool to an attacker. It is not unusual for a goalkeeper to make an assisting pass to a goal on a break away.

The goalkeeper is given several privileges above those of the other players, but only within the five-meter area in front of their own goal:&lt;ref name=Snyder&gt;Snyder, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ability to punch the ball with a clenched fist,
* The ability to touch the ball with two hands.

In general, a foul that would cause an ejection of a field player might bring on a five-metre shot on the goalkeeper. The goalkeeper also has one limitation that other players do not have: he cannot cross the half-distance line.&lt;ref name="Snyder" /&gt; Also, if a goalkeeper pushes the ball under water, the action will not be punished with a turnover like with field players, but with a penalty shot.

==Common techniques and practices==
=== Offense strategy ===
'''Player positioning'''

The most basic positional set up is known as a "3–3", so called because there are two lines in front of the opponent's goal. Another set up, used more by professional teams, is known as an "arc", "umbrella", or "mushroom"; perimeter players form the shape of an arc around the goal, with the hole set as the handle or stalk. Yet another option for offensive set is called a 4–2 or double hole; there are two center forward offensive players in front of the goal. Double hole is most often used in "man up" situations, or when the defense has only one skilled "hole D", or  to draw in a defender and then pass out to a perimeter player for a shot ("kick out").

Another, albeit less common offense, is the "motion c", sometimes nicknamed "washing machine offence", in which two "weak-side" (to the right of the goal for right-handed players) perimeter players set up as a wing and a flat.  The remaining four players swim in square pattern in which a player swims from the point to the hole and then out to the strong side wing. The wing moves to the flat and the flat to the point. The weak side wing and flat then control the tempo of play and try to make passes into the player driving towards the centre forward who can then either shoot or pass. This form of offence is used when no dominate hole set is available, or the hole defence is too strong. It is also seen much more often in women's water polo where teams may lack a player of sufficient size or strength to set up in the centre forward. The best advantage to this system is it makes man-coverage much more difficult for the defender and allows the offence to control the game tempo better once the players are "set up". The main drawback is this constant motion can be very tiring as well as somewhat predictable as to where the next pass is going to go.

'''Advancing the ball'''

When the offence takes possession of the ball, the strategy is to advance the ball down the field of play and to score a goal.  Players can move the ball by throwing it to a teammate or swimming with the ball in front of them ([[dribbling]]). If an attacker uses his/her arm to push away a defending player and free up space for a pass or shot, the referee will rule a turnover and the defence will take possession of the ball. If an attacker advances inside the 2-metre line without the ball or before the ball is inside the 2-metre area, (s)he is ruled [[offside (sport)|offside]] and the ball is turned over to the defence. This is often overlooked if the attacker is well to the side of the pool or when the ball is at the other side of the pool.

'''Setting the ball'''

The key to the offence is to accurately pass (or "set") the ball into the centre forward or hole set, positioned directly in front of the goal ("the hole"). Any field player may throw the hole set a "wet pass". A wet pass is one that hits the water just outside the hole set's reach. A dry pass may also be used. This is where the hole set receives the ball directly in his hand and then attempts a shot at the cage. This pass is much more difficult because if the pass is not properly caught, the officials will be likely to call an offensive foul resulting in a change of ball possession. The hole set attempts to take possession of the ball [after a wet pass], to shoot at the goal, or to draw a foul from his defender. A [[#Defense strategy|minor foul]] is called if his defender (called the "hole D") attempts to impede movement before the hole set has possession. The referee indicates the foul with one short whistle blow and points one hand to the spot of the foul and the other hand in the direction of the attack of the team to whom the free throw has been awarded. The hole set then has a "reasonable amount of time" (typically about three seconds; there is no FINA rule on this issue) to re-commence play by making a free pass to one of the other players. The defensive team cannot hinder the hole set until the free throw has been taken, but the hole set cannot shoot a goal once the foul has been awarded until the ball has been played by at least one other player. If the hole set attempts a goal without the free throw, the goal is not counted and the defence takes possession of the ball, unless the shot is made outside the 5-metre line. As soon as the hole set has a free pass, the other attacking players attempt to swim (or ''drive'') away from their defenders towards the goal. The players at the flat position will attempt to set a screen (also known as a pick) for the driver. If a driver gets free from a defender, the player calls for the pass from the hole set and attempts a shot at the goal.

In the top left corner, the shot clock can be seen, showing 28 seconds remaining in the white attack.]]

'''Man-Up (5 on 6)'''

If a defender interferes with a free throw, holds or sinks an attacker who is not in possession or splashes water into the face of an opponent, the defensive player is excluded from the game for twenty seconds, known as a 'kick out' or an ejection. The attacking team typically positions 4 players on the 2 metre line, and 2 players on 5 metre line (4–2), passing the ball around until an open player attempts a shot. Other formations include a 3–3 (two lines of three attackers each) or arc (attackers make an arc in front of the goal and one offensive player sits in the 'hole' or 'pit' in front of the goal). The five defending players try to pressure the attackers, block shots and prevent a goal being scored for the 20 seconds while they are a player down. The other defenders can only block the ball with one hand to help the goalkeeper. The defensive player is allowed to return immediately if the offence scores, or if the defence recovers the ball before the twenty seconds expires.

=== Defense strategy ===
[[File:Test Five AU vs GBR 0489.JPG|thumb|Water polo defense: A defender may only hold, block or pull an opponent who is touching or holding the ball.]]
On defence, the players work to regain possession of the ball and to prevent a goal in their own net. The defence attempts to knock away or steal the ball from the offense or to commit a foul in order to stop an offensive player from taking a goal shot. The defender attempts to stay between the attacker and the goal, a position known as ''inside water''.

'''Goalkeeper'''
{{Main|Goalkeeper (water polo)}}
Even with good backup from the rest of the defenders, stopping attacks can prove very difficult if the goalkeeper remains in the middle of the goal. The most defensible position is along a semicircular line connecting the goalposts and extending out in the centre. Depending on the ball carrier's location, the goalkeeper is positioned along that semicircle roughly a metre out of the goal to reduce the attacker's shooting angle. The goalkeeper stops using his or her hands to tread water once the opponent enters at about the 7 metre mark and starts to lift their upper body using the eggbeater technique to prepare to block the shot. Finally the goalkeeper tries to block the ball down, which is often hard for the longer reaches, but prevents an offensive rebound and second shot. As is the case with other defensive players, a goalkeeper who aggressively fouls an attacker in position to score can be charged with a penalty shot for the other team. The goalkeeper can also be ejected for twenty seconds if a major foul is committed.  Also inside the five metre mark, the goalie can swing at the ball with a closed fist without being penalised.

'''Advantage rule'''
If an offensive player, such as the centre forward, has possession of the ball in front of the goal, the defensive player tries to steal the ball or to keep the centre from shooting or passing. If the defender cannot achieve these aims, he may commit a foul intentionally. The hole set then is given a free throw but must pass off the ball to another offensive player, rather than making a direct shot at the goal. Defensive perimeter players may also intentionally cause a minor foul and then move toward the goal, away from their attacker, who must take a free throw. This technique, called [[Glossary of Water Polo#S|sloughing]], allows the defense an opportunity to double-team the hole set and possibly steal the inbound pass. The referee may refrain from declaring a foul, if in his judgment this would give the advantage to the offender's team. This is known as the ''Advantage Rule''.&lt;ref&gt;FINA Water Polo Rules, Section WP 7.3: [http://www.fina.org/project/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=119 Advantage Rule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023032003/http://www.fina.org/project/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=119 |date=23 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injuries==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ervin Zador.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Ervin Zádor after the [[Blood in the water match|Hungary vs. USSR match]] having been punched in the right eye]] --&gt;
Water polo is a contact sport, with little protective gear besides swim suits and caps with ear protectors and thus injuries are common. Among the most frequent serious injuries are those affecting the head and shoulders. Those induced to the head are usually caused by elbows or the ball itself, while shoulder injuries are a result of grabbing or pushing while shooting or passing. Other injuries take place underwater, such as leg and groin injuries, as many things can not be seen from above the surface and not much padding is used to protect the players.

Sunburn is a common minor injury in outdoor matches.  The irritation of the sunburn can be restrictive because of the sheer amount of movement involved in the sport. Players will often neglect applying sunscreen as this will impair the player's ability to grip the ball and rapidly deteriorate the ball's physical grip due to the oily nature of sunscreen. Having large amounts of sunscreen on during an official match is banned by [[FINA]] and most other state/national governing bodies.

==Variations==
[[Inner tube water polo]] is a style of water polo in which players, excluding the [[goalkeeper]], are required to [[Buoyancy|float]] in [[inner tube]]s. By floating in an inner tube players expend less energy than traditional water polo players, not having to tread water. This allows casual players to enjoy water polo without undertaking the intense [[Physical exercise|conditioning]] required for conventional water polo.

Surf polo, another variation of water polo, is played on [[surfboard]]s.&lt;ref name="LoEdmundsHanaHou"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hanahou.com/pages/Magazine.asp?Action=DrawArticle&amp;ArticleID=602&amp;MagazineID=38 |title= Boards &amp; Spikes |author= Catharine Lo and Dana Edmunds |work= [[Hana Hou!]] Vol. 10, No. 4 |date= August–September 2007 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  First played on the beaches of [[Waikiki]] in Hawaii in the 1930s and 1940s, it is credited to Louis Kahanamoku, [[Duke Kahanamoku]]'s brother.

[[Canoe polo]] or kayak polo is one of the eight disciplines of canoeing pursued in the UK, known simply as "polo" by its aficionados. Polo combines paddling and ball handling skills with a contact team game, where tactics and positional play are as important as the speed and fitness of the individual athletes.

Flippa ball is a precursor variant intended for younger and beginner players to learn the basics of polo.&lt;ref name="FlippaFun"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flippaball.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/FlippaFun-Backyard-Pool-Guide.pdf|title=Flippa Fun in the Backyard Pool|website=flippaball.com.au|page=6|access-date=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://maristwaterpolo.org.nz/about-flippa-ball/|title=About Flippa Ball – Marist Water Polo Club|website=maristwaterpolo.org.nz|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sporty.co.nz/flippaball/Introduction-to-Flippa-Ball/Introduction-1|title=Flippa Ball - Introduction|website=www.sporty.co.nz|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is played in shallow water and permits touching the bottom of the pool.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FlippaRules"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flippaball.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FlippaBall-Rules-Poster-.pdf|title=Flippa Ball Official Rules Pool|website=flippaball.com.au|page=6|archive-url=|access-date=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players rotate positions after each score.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FlippaRules" /&gt;

== Water polo equipment ==
{{double image|right|Polobal.jpg|60|NewWaterPoloBall.JPG|90|Water polo balls: old (left) and new designs}}
{{See also|Swimming (sport) #Swimwear|Swimming pool #Competition pools}}
Little player equipment is needed to play water polo. Items required in water polo include:
*'''Ball''': A [[water polo ball]] is constructed of waterproof material to allow it to float on the water. The cover is textured to give players additional grip. The size of the ball is different for men's, women's and junior games.
*'''Caps''': A [[water polo cap]] is used to protect the players' heads and ears, and to make them identifiable from afar. Home team field players wear numbered dark-colored caps; Visiting team field players wear numbered white caps. Both starting goalkeepers wear red caps (sometimes quartered), numbered "1" (substitute goalies' caps are numbered either "13" for FINA international play or "15" for NCAA play) Caps are fitted with ear protectors.
{{double image|right|USC Waterpolo Player.jpg|90|Test Five AU vs GBR 0389.JPG|180|Male swimsuit (left) and Female swimsuit (right)}}

*'''Goals''': Two goals are needed in order to play water polo. These can either be put on the side of the pool, or in the pool using floaters.
*'''Mouthguard''': A [[mouthguard]] is not mandatory in most tournaments, but is recommended.
*'''[[Competitive swimwear|Swimwear]]''': Male water polo players wear either [[swim briefs]] or jammers (thigh-length trunks). Female players must wear a [[one-piece swimsuit]].  Suit-grabbing fouls are common, so players often wear tight-fitting suits, and may layer on several suits at a time for additional security. Many swimwear labels also sell specialized water polo suits that feature reinforced stitching and tougher fabric.  Female water polo suits are generally one-piece outfits which do not have open backs, but zip securely up the back so as to not have straps that can be easily grabbed.

==Major competitions==
{{Main|Water polo at the Summer Olympics}}
Men's water polo at the Olympics was the first team sport introduced at the [[Water polo at the 1900 Summer Olympics|1900 games]], along with cricket, rugby, football, polo (with horses), rowing and tug of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/disciplines_uk.asp?DiscCode=WP|title=Water Polo - Summer Olympic Sport|date=10 August 2016|publisher=|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's water polo became an Olympic sport at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympic Games]] after political protests from the [[Australia women's national water polo team|Australian women's team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://library.la84.org/3ce/CoachingManuals/LA84WaterPolo.pdf|title=Water polo for players &amp; teachers of aquatics|last=Snyder|first=Pete|last2=Reutter|first2=Mary Jo|publisher=LA84 Foundation|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most historically known matches often referred to as the ''[[Blood in the Water match]]'', was a [[1956 Summer Olympics]] semi-final match between Hungary and the [[Soviet Union]], played in [[Melbourne]].  As the athletes left for the games, the [[Hungarian revolution of 1956|Hungarian revolution]] began, and the Soviet army crushed the uprising. The Hungarians defeated the Soviets 4–0 before the game was called off in the final minute to prevent angry Hungarians in the crowd reacting to Valentin Prokopov punching [[Ervin Zador]].

Every 2 to 4 years since 1973, a men's [[Water Polo World Championship]] is organized within the [[FINA World Aquatics Championships]]. Women's water polo was added in 1986. A second tournament series, the [[FINA Water Polo World Cup]], has been held every other year since 1979. In 2002, FINA organised the sport's first international league, the [[FINA Water Polo World League]].

There is also a [[European Water Polo Championship]] that is held every other year.

Professional water polo is played in many Southern and Eastern European countries like Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, Greece, Hungary, [[Serie A1 (water polo)|Italy]], Russia, Spain, etc. with the [[LEN Euroleague]] tournament played amongst the best teams.

There is also a [[World Club Water Polo Challenge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldclubwaterpolochallenge.com/|title=World Club Waterpolo Challenge|publisher=|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
