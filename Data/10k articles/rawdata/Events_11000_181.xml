The '''1916 [[Victorian Football Association]] season''' was not played owing to [[World War I]], which was at its peak at the time.

==Abandonment of the season==
In February, the Association met to determine whether or not to contest the premiership during the season, in light of the need to support the war effort in Europe. The Association had curtailed the [[1915 VFA season|1915 season]] five weeks early for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=Association season curtailed|date=15 July 1915|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its first meeting on 7 February, the clubs were divided in opinion: [[Brighton Football Club|Brighton]], {{AFL Nor}}, [[Brunswick Football Club|Brunswick]] and [[Northcote Football Club|Northcote]] were in favour of playing the season; {{AFL Foo}}, {{AFL Haw}}, [[Essendon Association Football Club|Essendon]] and [[Williamstown Football Club|Williamstown]] were opposed; and [[Port Melbourne Football Club|Port Melbourne]] and [[Prahran Football Club|Prahran]] were undecided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|date=8 February 1916|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=7|title=The Association's position}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the second meeting on 25 February, all clubs decided unanimously not to contest the premiership in 1916.&lt;ref name="abandon"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|date=26 February 1916|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=18|title=Football and war}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association resolved that its clubs should continue to operate, and could play matches for patriotic fund-raising purposes during the season.&lt;ref name="abandon" /&gt; Many Association players moved into the Victorian Junior Football Association, which had before the war been the first level of junior football below the Association.&lt;ref&gt;See Fiddian, Marc; ''The Bullants: A History of the Preston Football Club''; pp. 15-16. {{ISBN|0959255605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2396">On 18 March 1964 approximately 50 Moroccan students broke into the embassy of [[Morocco]] in the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Moscow]] and staged an all‐day [[sit-in]] protesting against death sentences handed down by a Moroccan court in [[Rabat]] four days earlier. The death sentences concerned 11 people who allegedly attempted to assassinate Moroccan King [[Hassan II]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/20/article-1-no-title.html| title =Article 1 -- No Title |publisher =''[[The New York Times]]''| date=March 20, 1964|accessdate =15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet authorities complied with the embassy's request to ignore [[extraterritoriality]] and remove the students by force, but later ignored the Moroccan ambassador's demand to punish the students.

==Protest==
The students forced their way into the embassy, which was then located on Moscow's Gorki Street (now [[Tverskaya Street]]), and occupied a wing of the building. The protesters carried placards demanding the immediate release of the convicted men.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; They said they would stay until 10 a.m. 19 March combining sit-in with a [[hunger strike]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

In the evening five officials from the Soviet Ministry of Education tried to persuade the students to abandon the demands.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; To the chagrin of authorities in Morocco, the embassy eventually asked the Soviet government to ignore extraterritoriality and storm the building to remove the students by force.&lt;ref name="cairn"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.cairn.info/zen.php?ID_ARTICLE=CMR_471_0033| title =Death of an African Student in Moscow|publisher =CAIRN.info|author=Julie Hessler| accessdate =15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet authorities complied with the request. However, later, when the Moroccan ambassador asked that the students lose their stipends and be expelled from the Soviet Union, the Soviet government quietly shifted all the stipends to public  organizations’ accounts, and replied that it had no jurisdiction over these organizations’ scholarships.&lt;ref name="cairn"/&gt;

===Based on journalism===
Slyusarchuk was born in [[Zhytomyr]], [[Ukraine]] on 10 May 1971.&lt;ref name="похоронив свою маму"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The prosecutor"/&gt; His 21-year-old mother, Natalia Tykhonovna Slyusarchuk of Zhytomyr, left her newborn son at a [[maternity home]]. She did not know the name of the father of her child, and Slyusarchuk's middle name was recorded on his birth certificate as "Tykhonovych" (the masculine version of Natalia Slyusarchuk’s  [[patronymic]]).&lt;ref name="похоронив свою маму"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Фальшивый нейрохирург"/&gt;

He was hospitalized at the Zhytomyr psychiatric hospital eight times between 1974 and 1987.&lt;ref name="Достоверного документа"/&gt; From 1980 to 1987 (second to eighth grade) Slyusarchuk lived and studied at an institutional school for young orphans in the town of [[Hryshkivtsi]] in [[Berdychiv Raion]], receiving a certificate for the completion of his education there.&lt;ref name="Сенсаційне викриття"&gt;{{cite news|author=Свiтлана Мартинець|script-title=uk:Сенсаційне викриття псевдопрофесора Пі|url=http://expres.ua/main/2011/10/06/51409-sensaciyne-vykryttya-psevdoprofesora-pi|work=[[Ekspres]]|date=6 October 2011|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all the documents pertaining to his education at the school were later destroyed; his birth date became 19 May 1974 on some documents, yielding negative results for official inquiries about his time at the school.&lt;ref name="Новi смертi"&gt;{{cite news|author=Свiтлана Мартинець, Iгор Починок|title=Псевдолiкар сiє новi смертi|url=http://www.expres.ua/main/2011/11/10/53698-psevdolikar-siye-novi-smerti|work=[[Ekspres]]|date=10 November 2011|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1987 to 1989, Slyusarchuk studied in the 208th group at the inter-regional Higher Vocational School of Railway Transport in [[Kozyatyn]], [[Vinnytsia Oblast]] to become a  [[plasterer]]-[[tile]]r-[[Facing (machining)|facing]] worker.&lt;ref name="Сенсаційне викриття"/&gt;
On 2 October 1989, according to order No. 31, he was transferred to the Specialized Vocational School No. 62 in [[Chervonohrad]], [[Lviv Oblast]]. According to teachers there, Slyusarchuk walked with a briefcase and a stethoscope like a doctor and conducted hypnosis sessions at a nearby school to earn money. On 1 June 1990, he received a certificate for the completion of his course; although his occupation was listed as "assistant foreman”, he was not appointed to a job.&lt;ref name="Новi смертi"/&gt; In 1993 Slyusarchuk was turned down for a position as a neurosurgeon at the hospital in [[Novoyavorivsk]] ([[Lviv Oblast]]), and later practiced medicine elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Во время задержания"&gt;{{cite news|author=Сергей Карнаухов|script-title=ru:Во время задержания, увидев милиционеров, Андрей Слюсарчук сказал единственную фразу: "Я вас ждал давно"|url=http://fakty.ua/143501-vo-vremya-zaderzhaniya-uvidev-milicionerov-andrej-slyusarchuk-skazal-edinstvennuyu-frazu-ya-vas-zhdal-davno|work=[[Fakty i Kommentarii]]|date=16 November 2011|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 July 1996, the first criminal complaint was brought against Slyusarchuk. The [[Zhydachiv Raion]] police in [[Lviv Oblast]]) accused him of fraud, investigating the case for eight years. According to the complaint, Slyusarchuk diagnosed a woman with a fatal illness, promised to cure her with expensive drugs, took [[United States dollar|$]]665 from her and disappeared; it indicated that he had a diploma from the M. I. Pirogov Vinnytsia Medical Institute.&lt;ref name="Убиває"&gt;{{cite news|author=Свiтлана Мартинець, Iгор Починок|script-title=uk:"Псевдолікар Слюсарчук убиває людей!"

On 17 July 2000, a second criminal complaint was brought against Slyusarchuk in [[Lviv]]. According to complainants Oleg and Bogdana Gamalii, they paid him $1,500 to treat their two young children; the children worsened following his treatment. After five years, the complaint was dropped.&lt;ref name="Убиває"/&gt;

From 2003 to 2006 Slyusarchuk lived in a Lviv Polytechnic National University dormitory, where he fraudulently diagnosed students and "treated" them with [[psychotropic drug]]s. He extorted large amounts of money from parents for treatment, telling them that their children would commit suicide without it, and distributed unapproved drugs for $4,000 per [[ampoule]].&lt;ref name="експерименти на людях"&gt;{{cite news|script-title=uk:Псевдопрофесор Андрій Слюсарчук двадцять років ставив експерименти на людях|url=http://vidomosti-ua.com/news/36177|work=Відомості-UA|date=24 November 2011|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Перші жертви"&gt;{{cite news|author=Свiтлана Мартинець|script-title=uk:Перші жертви псевдопрофесора Пі|url=http://www.expres.ua/main/2011/10/13/51869-pershi-zhertvy-psevdoprofesora-pi|work=[[Ekspres]]|date=13 October 2011|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polishchuk later found a 2000 dissertation by Nikolai Ershov in the [[Russian State Library]] in [[Moscow]]; the only difference between Ershov's dissertation and Slyusarchuk's was in the title.&lt;ref name="Я не виновен"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Полищук"/&gt; After Polishchuk's report to the [[rector (academia)|rector]], an order to dismiss Slyusarchuk was issued.&lt;ref name="Полищук"/&gt; When the [[academic administration]] requested verification from the [[Higher Attestation Commission]] of the [[Ministry of Education of Russia]] of Slyusarchuk's credentials, it was told that there was no record of him as a professor or a Doctor of Science.&lt;ref name="Я не виновен"/&gt; He was a professor in the Department of Information Systems and Networks at Lviv Polytechnic from September 2009 to June 2011.&lt;ref name=Prize/&gt;&lt;ref name="Крах"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Терещук"/&gt;

In 2010 the [[Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine]], headed by [[Dmytro Tabachnyk]], reportedly gave Slyusarchuk a document making him a professor in the department of neurosurgery at the A.

===Based on interviews===
According to a birth certificate shown to journalists, Slyusarchuk was born in the village of [[Tuğ]] in the [[Hadrut Rayon (NKAO)|Hadrut Rayon]] of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]]. His father was Mushegyan Vartan Aramovich, an ethnic Armenian. His mother, a Ukrainian, was Ruslana Tykhonovna Slyusarchuk. The Hadrut Rayon [[civil registry]] reportedly changed his birth details to his mother’s by request in 1984, and he became Andriy Tykhonovych Slyusarchuk.&lt;ref name="Я не виновен"/&gt;

Slyusarchuk said that he graduated from secondary school in [[Vinnytsia]] at age nine. His parents, medical professionals (his mother a pediatrician and his father a cardiac surgeon), died in a car accident the year he graduated from secondary school.&lt;ref name="vgolos.com.ua"&gt;{{cite web|script-title=uk:Андрій Слюсарчук: Я вимагаю до себе іншого ставлення суспільства, але ж не безпідставно|website=Вголос|url=http://www.vgolos.com.ua/articles/andriy_slyusarchuk_ya_vymagayu_do_sebe_inshogo_stavlennya_suspilstva_ale_zh_ne_bezpidstavno_100196.html|language=Ukrainian|date=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s he was subjected to [[Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|punitive psychiatry]], physically abused and sent to a psychiatric hospital where he was tied to a bed, given [[psychoactive drug]]s and injected with [[sulfozin]]. When the psychiatrists asked him which books he was reading, Slyusarchuk said that he was reading  medical literature and works by [[Ivan Pavlov]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]]. He was sent to an institution for the mentally-ill children.&lt;ref name="Консилиум психиатров"&gt;{{cite news|author=Игорь Осипчук|script-title=ru:Профессор Андрей Слюсарчук: "Консилиум психиатров принял решение отправить меня в заведение для душевнобольных детей"|url=http://fakty.ua/133550-professor-andrej-slyusarchuk-konsilium-psihiatrov-prinyal-reshenie-otpravit-menya-v-zavedenie-dlya-dushevnobolnyh-detej|work=[[Fakty i Kommentarii]]|date=26 May 2011|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slyusarchuk was placed in a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] orphanage, where he was misunderstood by his teachers and encouraged to conform. When he tried to retrieve his secondary-school certification to enter a higher educational institution, he was labeled mentally ill and punished. At age 11, Slyusarchuk ran away from the orphanage.&lt;ref name="vgolos.com.ua"/&gt;

He taught himself by reading the book ''Your Abilities, Man'', which was given to him by Soviet psychiatrist [[Andrei Snezhnevsky]] (who examined him when he was a child).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:"Доктор Пи" запомнил 30 млн. цифр, чтобы вернуть близкого человека|trans-title=Doctor Pi memorized 30 billion numbers to make his crony come back|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/ukraine/doktor-pi-zapomnil-30-mln-tsifr-chtoby-vernut-blizkoho-cheloveka.html|work=[[Segodnya]]|date=14 March 2009|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Slyusarchuk arrived in [[Moscow]] he found a [[Romani people|Gypsy]] camp, where he was accepted, fed and taught to beg for money. At the time, he felt the environment was what he needed; he learned about Gypsy hypnotism and its use.

After living with the Gypsies for about a year, Slyusarchuk met an employee of the [[Russian National Research Medical University]]. They became friends, and through him Slyusarchuk received an appointment with Soviet Minister of Health [[Yevgeniy Chazov]].

With Chazov's help, at age 12 Slyusarchuk entered the general-therapy department of the Russian State Medical University. He specialized in neurosurgery under Professor E. I. Gusev (Гусев Е.И.), and his teachers included neurologists V. A. Karlov (Карлов В. А.), A. N. Konovalov and A. M. Vein (Вейн А.М.).&lt;ref name="vgolos.com.ua"/&gt; Slyusarchuk claimed to have graduated from the Russian National Research Medical University with an honorable diploma at 18, beginning a postgraduate course without the usual internship.

His partial reported timeline was:
* 1985&amp;nbsp;— Entered the 2nd Moscow State Medical University, named after [[Nikolay Pirogov]] and now known as the Russian National Research Medical University.
* 1992&amp;nbsp;— Entered the [[St Petersburg University]] medical psychology faculty.
* 1998&amp;nbsp;— Defended his [[Candidate of Sciences]] dissertation.
* 2003&amp;nbsp;— Defended his Doctor of Sciences dissertation.
* 2006&amp;nbsp;— Claimed a world record for memorizing 5,100 digits in 117 seconds, not accepted by international organizations.&lt;ref name="два мировых рекорда"/&gt;

In June 2009, after claiming a world record for memorizing [[pi]] by being able to recite randomly selected sequences from the first 30 million places of pi, Slyusarchuk was congratulated by Ukrainian President [[Viktor Yuschenko]] and funding for a research center for the development of Slyusarchuk's methodology was discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/14234.html Victor Yushchenko meets Andriy Slyusarchuk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bigmir.net/ukraine/154314/ Ющенко поздравил нейрохирурга, запомнившего 30 миллионов цифр]&lt;/ref&gt; A December 22 press release from the President of Ukraine reported that Yushchenko and Slyusarchuk had discussed an Institute of Brain Studies to prevent and treat neurological disorders, focusing on social problems such as drug and alcohol abuse. Yushchenko issued a decree providing for the Institute of Brain Studies, for research in neurology, psychiatry, psychology and [[neurorehabilitation]], to be established within one month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.president.gov.ua/news/16263.html |title=Віктор Ющенко провів зустріч з професором Андрієм Слюсарчуком |publisher=President.gov.ua |date=2009-12-22 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.ua/documents/10247.html |title=УКАЗ ПРЕЗИДЕНТА УКРАЇНИ № 1094/2009.

Slyusarchuk claimed that his memorization skills were based on mental associations between figures, images, words, numbers ([[mnemonic]]s) and a [[Eidetic memory|photographic memory]] of everything on which he concentrates. According to the scientists verifying Slyusarchuk's records, "The mnemonic technique can be used by any person".&lt;ref name="два мировых рекорда"/&gt;
A February 2010 article in the newspaper ''Novaya'' reported that Slyusarchuk's student, Alexander Chervonyi, claimed that he could reproduce many of his teacher's memory performances (including the recitation of randomly-selected sequences from the first five million decimal places of [[pi]].&lt;ref name="Оружие"/&gt;

Slyusarchuk became interested in chess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amateur beats Rybka blindfold – while hell freezes over|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/amateur-beats-rybka-blindfold-while-hell-freezes-over|date=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, he defeated the chess program [[Rybka]] in an exhibition match in Kiev while blindfolded.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|lr_1_QjTr8s|STB: Slyusarchuk v Rybka, 27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 May, Slyusarchuk said that he memorized 2,600 books on chess in preparation for the game with Rybka.&lt;ref name="Консилиум психиатров"/&gt; The ''[[Trinidad and Tobago Guardian]]'' newspaper published an account of Slyusarchuk’s victory over Rybka as "Oh, the wonders of gullibility", quoting the Internet-based chess newspaper ''[[Chess Today]]'': "What can help [to prove that it was a mystification] are Slyusarchuk’s numerous absurd statements which show his complete ignorance of chess—quite unforgivable for a guy who has read, as is claimed, more than 2000 chess books within several months!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Carl Jacobs|title=Oh, the wonders of gullibility|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/sport/2011/05/05/oh-wonders-gullibility|work=[[Trinidad and Tobago Guardian]]|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Slyusarchuk's friend, journalist Igor Yurchenko, no one argued that Slyusarchuk played chess better than a world champion or a [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]]; at the time, Slyusarchuk stressed that it was not a chess event but a demonstration of memory. Sponsors bought Slyusarchuk a heavy-duty computer which played many games daily with another comparable computer, and he memorized the strategy of these games. Memorizing thousands of chess games reportedly helped him defeat the Rybka-4; according to Yurchenko, Slyusarchuk  just recalled memorized games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Игорь Осипчук|script-title=ru:Диссертация, которую Слюсарчук защитил в России, засекречена.

After the ''Ekspres'' articles attracted widespread publicity Slyusarchuk denied the accusations in interviews for other media sources, saying that he had applied to the [[General Prosecutor of Ukraine]] to clarify the situation and disprove the ''Ekspres'' allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obozrevatel.com/crime/professor-slyusarchuk-nameren-cherez-gpu-otstoyat-svoyu-reputatsiyu.htm|script-title=ru:Профессор Слюсарчук намерен через ГПУ отстоять свою репутацию|publisher=Obozrevatel.com |date=14 October 2011|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vn.20minut.ua/Podii/geniy-andriy-slyusarchuk-podav-do-sudu-za-te-scho-yogo-vikrili-10210060.html|script-title=uk:Геній Андрій Слюсарчук подав до суду за те, що його викрили|publisher=20minut.ua|date=31 October 2011|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 November 2011, the [[Ukrainian police]] detained him on suspicion of forgery and fraud.&lt;ref name=fraud&gt;{{cite web|author=Lyseiko Markiyan|url=http://photo.ukrinform.ua/eng/current/photo.php?id=426649 |title=Lviv court sends Dr. Pi to custody|publisher=[[Ukrinform]]|date=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Галина Терещук|script-title=uk:"Псевдопрофесор" Слюсарчук арештований…|url=http://www.radiosvoboda.org/articleprintview/24390874.html|publisher=[[Radio Liberty]]|date=14 November 2011|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the investigation, senior officials of the [[Ministry of Education and Science, Youth and Sport of Ukraine]] (including department heads and the vice-minister) had told the press that Slyusarchuk's documents and scientific titles were valid according to Ukrainian law and protocol. Large portions of Slyusarchuk's scientific works were considered classified, with [[state secrets privilege]] in Ukraine and Russia.&lt;ref name="Дело"/&gt;&lt;ref name="У Табачника"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ntn.ua/uk/video/agenty_vplyvu/2011/11/15/5422 |title=Феномен|publisher=Channel "Agents of influence"|date=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Валерия Чепурко, Марианна Попович|url=http://kp.ua/incidents/311580-doktor-py-zhaluetsia-na-opukhol-mozgha|script-title=ru:"Доктор Пи" жалуется на опухоль мозга|work=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda in Ukraine]]|date=18 November 2011|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Олексій Бєльський, Олег Василевський|url=http://ntn.ua/uk/products/programs/svidok/news/2011/11/17/6957|script-title=uk:Відомого нейрохірурга Андрія Слюсарчука підозрюють в шарлатанстві|publisher=Ntn.ua|date=17 November 2011|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At Slyusarchuk's trial people who admired him and invited him to work for them testified that although they were aware that he was not a doctor, they did not report him; he continued to practice neurosurgery in hospitals.&lt;ref name="Карнаухов"&gt;{{cite news|author=Сергей Карнаухов|script-title=ru:Андрей Слюсарчук: "С ФСБ России было заключено соглашение, что я не разглашаю результатов своих научных работ"|url=http://fakty.ua/171473-andrej-slyusarchuk-s-fsb-rossii-bylo-zaklyucheno-soglashenie-chto-ya-ne-razglashayu-rezultatov-svoih-nauchnyh-rabot|work=[[Fakty i Kommentarii]]|date=26 October 2013|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2 February to 1 March 2012, Slyusarchuk underwent a psychiatric examination at Lviv Oblast Psychiatric Hospital.&lt;ref name="экспертиза"/&gt; The examination found Slyusarchuk partially sane from a legal standpoint; he had a "[[mixed personality disorder]] with a predominance of [[antisocial personality disorder|dissocial]], [[histrionic personality disorder|hysterical]] and [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] elements".&lt;ref name="Диагноз Слюсарчука"/&gt; According to Alexander Soroka, Slyusarchuk is mentally ill but responsible for his actions; if such a person is imprisoned, they would be supervised and treated by a psychiatrist as needed.&lt;ref name="Формулировка"/&gt; The examination results were questioned by Ukrainian psychiatrist [[Semyon Gluzman]]: "If Doctor Pi begins to testify, a lot of compromising materials on the powerful of the world can appear. But in this way, it all can be attributed to his mental illness. I saw many performances of Slyusarchuk on television, listened to his speeches on radio and did not notice any signs of mental illness".&lt;ref name="Формулировка"/&gt; According to Gluzman, none of his colleagues suspected that Slyusarchuk was mentally ill.&lt;ref name="Формулировка"/&gt;

He received a second psychiatric examination at Pavlov Psychiatric Hospital in Kiev from 2 July to the fall of 2012.&lt;ref name="в психбольницу"/&gt; [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] public-affairs department head Volodymyr Polishchuk said, "Independent examination [was] conducted to check Slyusarchuk's mental health and his possible psychic and hypnotic abilities".&lt;ref name=hospital&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Pi placed in mental hospital|url=http://kyivweekly.com.ua/accent/news/2012/07/02/094847.html|publisher=Kyiv Weekly|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slyusarchuk's first attorneys had based their strategy on a finding of mental incompetence,&lt;ref name="потери"&gt;{{cite news|author=Вероника Савченко|script-title=ru:Андрей Слюсарчук несет потери|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2231662|work=Коммерсантъ Украина|date=12 July 2013|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; a strategy with which he disagreed.&lt;ref name="потери"/&gt; In his final testimony at the trial Slyusarchuk said, "The logic of such 'expert opinions' is simple: to diminish the defendant's attempts to adduce evidence in his defense, to force court and public not to believe a word said by him, he is declared out of his mind. The true value of such 'examinations' is known because since the USSR [[punitive psychiatry in the Soviet Union|punitive psychiatry]] has been a trusted servant of the [[NKVD]] and the [[KGB]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=uk:Останнє слово "Доктора Пі": Слюсарчук звинуватив прокуратуру і суд у виконанні політичного замовлення|url=http://www.pic.com.ua/ostannje-slovo-doktora-pi-slyusarchuk-zvynuvatyv-prokuraturu-i-sud-u-vykonanni-politychnoho-zamovlennya.html|publisher=Новий ПIК: Полiтика i культура|language=Ukrainian|date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to investigators, he did not graduate from a university; his background consisted of an institutional school, a sewing [[vocational school]] in  [[Chervonohrad]] and treatment at the Zhytomyr psychiatric hospital. With his forged credentials, he worked as a neurosurgeon and held senior positions for long periods.&lt;ref name="Карнаухов"/&gt;

According to a former agent of the USSR [[secret service]] who knew Slyusarchuk by sight, he was probably a product of a secret KGB pilot project. The agent was aware of a program in which orphans with unusual abilities were recruited throughout the Soviet Union; many died as a result of neurological experiments, but Slyusarchuk survived. He believes that Slyusarchuk participated in the secret pilot projects, receiving a professorship in return. His medical knowledge was derived from books and his memory was actually faulty; over time, he came to believe that he actually held the university diplomas. According to the agent, sealed documents about Slyusarchuk are stored in the KGB archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Валерия Чепурко, Марианна Попович|script-title=ru:"Доктор Пи" - результат экспериментов КГБ СССР?|url=http://kp.ua/incidents/315293-doktor-py-rezultat-eksperymentov-khb-sssr|work=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda in Ukraine]]|date=12 December 2011|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slyusarchuk maintained that his case was fabricated by the Prosecutor General and the [[Security Service of Ukraine]]. In 2005, he reportedly accidentally damaged his original diploma from the Russian National Research Medical University; a month later he received a duplicate, and denied any forgery. In 2003 Slyusarchuk reportedly met with Russian [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) agents, agreeing in writing not to disclose the results of his scientific works and advising the Ukrainian government. In 2011, he traveled to Moscow and asked the former FSB curator for help. When Slyusarchuk was told that the FSB would confirm his education and academic degrees if he cooperated with them, he refused.&lt;ref name="Карнаухов"/&gt;

Under questioning, the head of the university archives testified that Slyusarchuk showed her his damaged diploma in 2005 and his full name was legible. Verifying his surname in the registry, the woman submitted a request to the [[rector (academia)|rector]] for approval. He did so, adding the instructions: "Carry out according to procedure"; the university neither proved nor disproved whether Slyusarchuk originally received a diploma from them.&lt;ref name="Я не виновен"/&gt;

At a 16 December 2011 press conference, [[Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine|Minister of Education and Science]] [[Dmytro Tabachnyk]] said that his ministry's  [[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Russian counterpart]] admitted that it had mistakenly issued Slyusarchuk a duplicate diploma.&lt;ref name="Пришляк"/&gt; At the press conference, Slyusarchuk’s diplomas (including a duplicate) were demonstrated to be [[Image scanner|scanned documents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Наталiя Мельник|title=Диплом А.Слюсарчука - фальшивий (фото документiв)|url=http://www.unn.com.ua/uk/news/558356-diplom-a.slyusarchuka---falshiviy-foto-dokumentiv|date=16 December 2011|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Conclusions and sentence}}Conviction and sentencing ==
In the [[Verkhovna Rada]], Slyusarchuk's activities were called "the largest-scale fraud in the 20 years of Ukrainian independence".&lt;ref name="Фальшивый нейрохирург"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Самый известный"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Мандзюк"/&gt; According to the [[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency]], his defrauding of government agencies is unprecedented.&lt;ref name="Феномен"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ксенія Нестеренко|script-title=uk:Феномен "Доктора Пі": як ЗМІ та чиновники видали шахраю ліцензію на вбивство|url=http://www.unian.ua/society/884757-fenomen-doktora-pi-yak-zmi-ta-chinovniki-vidali-shahrayu-litsenziyu-na-vbivstvo.html|publisher=[[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency]]|language=Ukrainian|date=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012,  ''Ukrainsky Medychny Chasopys'' (''Ukrainian Medical Journal'') published the outcome of his case entitled, "Head doctors who let the person without medical training into operating room should be held criminally responsible."&lt;ref name="Устинов"/&gt; In the article, Ukrainian psychiatrist [[Semyon Gluzman]] expressed the opinion that Slyusarchuk skillfully took advantage of poor security; if he had chosen a lower-profile specialty, he might have succeeded. According to Gluzman, Ukraine has hundreds of people with the degree of [[Doctor of Sciences]] with expertise comparable to Slyusarchuk’s.&lt;ref name="Устинов"/&gt; In the journal, Doctor of Science [[Olga Bogomolets]] wrote that the admission of a person without medical training to an operating room violated laws clearly regulating who can practice medicine, when and where; a hospital supervising physician who violates the law must be held accountable.&lt;ref name="Устинов"/&gt;

On 14 February 2014, the [[Sykhiv Raion]] Court sentenced Slyusarchuk to eight years in prison after finding him guilty of five counts of illegal medical activities and two counts of murder by negligence: a 52-year-old named Lozovoy and three-year-old Daniil Prokopchuk of [[Ternopil Oblast]]. He was also found guilty of knowingly using forged documents and five counts of appropriating another's property by deception and breach of confidence (fraud). The court upheld victim claims, with Slyusarchuk fined about $40,000 (the amount of money paid for his services). He was also fined ₴70,000 to compensate Lozovoy's family and ₴30,000 for each of the other four victims.&lt;ref name=Sentence/&gt; Slyusarchuk was fined a total of ₴500,000 in victim compensation and ₴44,000 in state fines.&lt;ref name="засудили"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Феномен"/&gt; The court found that Slyusarchuk’s diplomas from the Moscow and Vinnytsia medical universities were falsified.&lt;ref name="засудили"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Феномен"/&gt;

In a five-bed prison cell furnished with a table, a washstand, a toilet, bookshelves, a TV and a radio, he reads books on medicine, the criminal code and the criminal-procedure code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Анна Мищишин|script-title=ru:Андрей Слюсарчук в камере читает книги о медицине и уголовный кодекс|url=http://kp.ua/incidents/443371-andrei-sluisarchuk-v-kamere-chytaet-knyhy-o-medytsyne-y-uholovnyi-kodeks|work=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda in Ukraine]]|date=13 March 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014 Slyusarchuk dismissed his attorneys, telling them that for what he paid for their services he could have bought ten more diplomas. He distrusts defense attorneys, feeling that they do their job poorly, and hoped to appeal his conviction at the regular session of the Lviv Oblast Appeal Court scheduled for 1 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Анна Мищишин|script-title=ru:"Доктор Пи" дал отставку своим адвокатам и надеется на апелляцию|url=http://kp.ua/incidents/469232-doktor-py-dal-otstavku-svoym-advokatam-y-nadeetsia-na-apelliatsyui|work=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda in Ukraine]]|date=8 September 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 2011, Ukrainian president [[Viktor Yanukovych]] issued Decree No 960/2011  awarding Slyusarchuk the 2011 State Prize of Ukraine for "scientific achievements in the field of education" for a series of works: "The complex of educational information technologies for presenting, memorizing and processing superlarge information objects in the learning process".&lt;ref name="Пришляк"/&gt; Slyusarchuk's research involved the technology of inputting large amounts of information into electronic databases and its playback. Portions on which Slyusarchuk worked are stamped "secret".&lt;ref name="После ареста"/&gt; Slyusarchuk's portions  were published in Russia and are secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Галина Гупало, Валерия Чепурко|script-title=ru:Доктор ПИ, кто он: непризнанный гений или доктор Зло?|url=http://kp.ua/incidents/311935-doktor-py-kto-on-nepryznannyi-henyi-yly-doktor-zlo|work=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda in Ukraine]]|date=21 November 2011|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research was nominated by the [[academic administration]] of Lviv Polytechnic for the State Prize,&lt;ref name="Крах"/&gt;&lt;ref name="После ареста"/&gt; and the issue was debated in Kiev by a commission of Ukrainian scientists.&lt;ref name="После ареста"/&gt;

[[File:Billboard TouringConf.gif|thumb|right|284px|The event logo for 2009]]
The '''''Billboard'' Live Music Awards''' (previously known as the '''''Billboard'' Touring Conference and Awards''' until 2018) is an annual meeting sponsored by [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine that honors the top international live entertainment industry artists and professionals. Established in 2004,&lt;ref name="bb103004"/&gt; it has thus been described as "part industry conference, part awards show".&lt;ref name="wnewfm"/&gt;

Many of the awards are based on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Boxscore chart tracking concert, comedy and other live entertainment attendance and gate receipts, and on real box office performance.&lt;ref name="bbc091809"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8262784.stm | title=Osbourne to receive legend award  | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=September 18, 2009 | accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the awards often equate to commercial success.&lt;ref name="wnewfm"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.wnew.com/2008/11/am-nuggets-allm.html | title=A.M. Nuggets: Allman Brothers Honored at Billboard Touring Awards | author=Simpson, Matt | publisher=[[WNEW-FM|wnew.com]] | date=November 18, 2008 | accessdate=2009-10-11 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "top tour" superlative award is also given on the basis of fan polls. The "Legend of Live" and Humanitarian awards are given to individuals for their ongoing contributions to the live entertainment touring industry.&lt;ref name="bbc091809"/&gt;

==History==
The conference and awards are held in November of each year, traditionally at the [[Roosevelt Hotel (New York)|Roosevelt Hotel]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]] in [[New York City]] but, since 2016, at hotels in the [[Los Angeles]] area.  The conference usually takes place over two days and is attended by figures from the music and concert industry.&lt;ref name="bb110906"/&gt; Each year features a keynote speaker from the performance industry, who in the past have included the likes of [[Gene Simmons]] of [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.aetv.com/news/?id=360662 | title=Gene Simmons to Deliver Keynote Q&amp;A at Billboard Touring Conference | publisher=[[A&amp;E News]] | date=September 4, 2008 | accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[3 Doors Down]].&lt;ref name="bb110906"/&gt;

While recorded music has an established awards structure headed by the [[Grammy Awards]] and also featuring the [[American Music Awards]] and the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], live performance music has not had the same.  The ''Billboard'' Touring Awards are an attempt to fill that gap.  ''Billboard'' previously attempted to enter the awards arena for recorded music with the charts-based [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Award]], which lasted from 1990 through 2006, returning in 2011.  Those awards featured two slots for Concert Venue Award and Touring Venue Award, but were not otherwise live-performance-based.

Award names and awards given themselves have varied somewhat each year, with for example the Top Comedy Tour and Concert Marketing and Promotion Awards being added in 2007 and the Fans Choice being added in 2008, both being determined by fan vote.&lt;ref name="ld112108"/&gt;  There are typically three nominees in each category.&lt;ref name="bb2005w"/&gt;

Repeat winners in the awards have been common, with country artist [[Kenny Chesney]] winning Top Package Tour six consecutive years through 2009&lt;ref name="bb110509"/&gt; and [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] winning four times as well starting in 2004.&lt;ref name="rs112108"/&gt;

The '''Bogotá Bracelet''' incident took place in May 1970 when [[Bobby Moore]], the captain of the [[England national football team]], was detained in [[Colombia]] for four days after being accused of stealing a [[bracelet]] from a jewellery shop located in the [[Bogotá]] hotel in which the team were staying.

The arrest took place in the build-up to the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|World Cup Finals]] where England were to defend the cup they had won in 1966. It provoked widespread reaction in the [[United Kingdom]], including a diplomatic intervention at the behest of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]], and across the world in general.

On 28 May 1970, Moore was conditionally released and flew to join his teammates in Mexico where he played in all of England's World Cup matches. The Colombian authorities came to the conclusion that Moore was innocent of any wrongdoing, but the case was not formally closed until 1972.

==Background==
As part of their preparations for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] being held in Mexico that summer, the England football team planned to play two friendly matches in [[South America]] to help them prepare for the high [[altitudes]] they would face once the tournament began.

They were scheduled to play first in Colombia, on 20 May 1970, and then in Ecuador on 24 May. England left their forward base in Mexico City on 18 May and arrived in the Colombian capital Bogotá, checking into the Hotel Tequendama.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson p.72-74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
===Alleged theft===
Although the various accounts of the incident differ somewhat in exact details, the basic outline of what happened is all the same. Located near the [[foyer]] of  the hotel was a gift shop selling jewellery known as the Fuego Verde (Green Fire). A number of the English players visited the store at one point or another, browsing for gifts to take home. At 6:25pm, Moore went in with Bobby Charlton to look for a present for Charlton's wife. Team doctor [[Neil Phillips]] was also in the shop as at one point was [[Peter Thompson (footballer, born 1942)|Peter Thompson]].

After looking at some of the items in the display cases, Moore and Charlton found nothing that interested them and left again. They were standing in the foyer when the assistant in the shop, Clara Padilla, came out and accused them of stealing a valuable bracelet from a display case. Moore and Charlton protested their innocence and offered to allow themselves to be searched.

Despite their denials, Padilla repeatedly identified them as the culprits of the alleged theft. Soon tourist police and hotel staff were on hand, as were most of the English players. Doctor Phillips went to fetch [[Alf Ramsey]]. When he arrived, Ramsey took charge of the situation and spoke to the authorities. Moore and Charlton were briefly questioned, and made an official statement.

This appeared to have cleared the matter up, and they even received apologies for the inconvenience. The match against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] went ahead, and England won the game 4–0, with Moore and Charlton both playing. By a [[gentlemen's agreement]], the travelling British sports journalists agreed not to mention the incident.

===Arrest===
After their win in Bogotá, England then proceeded on to their match against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] in [[Quito]] and won 2–0 there. England were scheduled to fly back to Mexico City via Bogotá, where there would be a four and a half hour [[stopover]]. Neil Phillips suggested that to avoid any further problems they should take an alternative route via [[Panama City]]. Both Ramsey and Moore rejected this idea, as they felt it would indicate wrongdoing and England took their arranged flight back to Bogotá.

They checked into the same hotel where the bracelet incident had taken place. To fill the time up while they waited for their flight the team sat down to watch the film ''[[Shenandoah (film)|Shenandoah]]''. As they were sitting there two [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] Colombian police officers quietly took Moore out and formally arrested him for theft.&lt;ref&gt;McKinstry p.409&lt;/ref&gt;

The Colombian police acted after a new witness Alvaro Suarez came forward, claiming to have seen Moore take the bracelet. Only lobbying by the British ambassador had stopped Moore from being arrested at the airport in front of cameras. Suarez said he saw what happened through the shop window and supported the version of Clara Padilla.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson p. 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;

As it became clear that Moore might be detained for some time, Ramsey decided that, with the World Cup just a few days away from beginning he had to go on to Mexico without his captain. Two FA officials remained in Bogotá to assist Moore, and further help was provided by British Embassy officials.

Neither Bobby Charlton nor Peter Thompson were arrested, despite their presence in the shop at the time of the incident, and they left the hotel along with the rest of the squad and boarded the plane. Many of the other players hadn't noticed or realised the significance of Moore's absence, as he was often called away to do interviews or meet people. Once they had taken off, Ramsey explained what had happened to the players, staff and press.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson p.91-92&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[public relations]] problems of the English were further complicated when [[Jeff Astle]], who hated flying, had several drinks to calm his nerves. Astle was clearly [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] once they reached Mexico City, and had to be helped along by his teammates. This led one Mexican newspaper to brand the English as "a team of drunks and thieves".&lt;ref&gt;Dawson p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detention===
Moore was held in a room in the Bogotá police headquarters while his fate was decided. He was ultimately charged, and faced with prosecution for theft. In light of the special circumstances, it was arranged that, rather than be sent to one of the city's [[prison]]s, Moore was kept under [[house arrest]] at the home belonging to the Director of the [[Colombian Football Federation]] [[Alfonso Senior]]. He was allowed to train, so he could keep up his [[Physical fitness|fitness]], although he was constantly followed by armed police guards. In press reports there was initially some confusion about the fact that the alleged theft and Moore's arrest had taken place several days apart.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson p.93&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrest sparked international media attention. Interest in the incident was stoked by the fact that Moore was a particularly well-known footballer generally respected throughout the game. In Britain there was massive press interest in Moore's wife Tina, who was shortly due to go out and watch England play in Mexico, and she was followed by a crowd of journalists wherever she went.&lt;ref&gt;Powell p.135-138&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore was generally perceived to be innocent. Ramsey expressed his own belief in his captain. "I should have thought that the integrity of this man would be enough to answer these charges. It is too ridiculous for words".&lt;ref&gt;McKinstry p.413&lt;/ref&gt; The former Brazil coach [[Joao Saldanha]] observed that when he had stayed at the hotel with his team [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]] they had experienced a similar incident – in which jewellry had been hidden on them and money demanded in order to avoid a scandal. Saldanha described the allegations against Moore as "disgraceful" and "slander".&lt;ref&gt;McKinstry p.411&lt;/ref&gt;

In the England camp many of the players considered the charge ridiculous and treated it as a joke. Ramsey was more concerned as the matter disrupted his carefully planned preparations for the World Cup, and made a contingency plan to play [[Norman Hunter (footballer)|Norman Hunter]] in Moore's central defensive role and make [[Alan Mullery]] the team's captain. He was facing up to the possibility that he might lose Moore for the entire World Cup.

In Bogotá, Moore was taken before a judge, Justice Peter Dorado, and questioned for four hours. Moore denied he knew anything about the theft or had even ever seen the bracelet in question. Confused by the conflicting claims, Justice Dorado arranged for the authorities to stage a [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]] of the incident with Moore and Padilla. Her version was undermined as she claimed that Moore had slipped the bracelet into the left-hand pocket of his [[blazer]], and it was demonstrated that the blazer had no pocket on the left side. She then changed various parts of her story and eventually left in tears. It was also questioned why the fresh witness, Alvaro Suarez waited four days to come forward.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson p. 95-97&lt;/ref&gt; There were also conflicting suggestions about the value of the bracelet. Initially it was said to be valued around £500, but later it is claimed to be worth £5,000, while the owner of the shop requested £6,000 in compensation. As Moore was driven back from the re-enactment, cries of "Viva Bobby" could be heard from the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

Harold Wilson hoped that a strong performance by England at the World Cup would boost the chances of his governing [[Labour Party (United Kingdom)|Labour Party]] being re-elected in the [[1970 general election (UK)|1970 General Election]]. Wilson was so concerned by Moore's arrest that he requested repeated lobbying of the Colombian government by the British embassy in [[Bogotá]]. The Colombians were wary of creating what was fast becoming a [[diplomatic incident]].

===Release===
On 28 May 1970, Moore was taken before Justice Dorado and told there was insufficient evidence for a prosecution and he was to be set free. Moore released a statement "I am happy to be set free and the allegations against me turned out to be groundless". He promised to further co-operate with the Colombian authorities and thanked the Colombian people "for the many expressions of sympathy and support which I have received from them in the last few days".&lt;ref&gt;Dawson p.101-102&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore was given a conditional release that required him to report to the Colombian consulate in Mexico, although this was abandoned soon afterwards with an official stating "It was an accusation that needed proof. "It was never proved. Moore has no obligation with the embassy. There was never much case".&lt;ref&gt;Dawson p.179&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore arrived in Mexico City and then flew on to [[Guadalajara]] where the English were preparing to play their opening match against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] on 2 June. He was greeted warmly at the airport by Ramsey. Moore was taken back to the England team hotel where he was greeted by the other players lined up in a [[guard of honour]] to applaud him.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson p.102-103&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June he captained England to a 1–0 victory against Romania.

==Aftermath==
England went out of the World Cup in the Quarter Final stage after losing 3–2 to [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]]. Bobby Moore was widely praised for his performances in the tournament, especially in England's group stage match against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. Ramsey later told a journalist that the incident had been the worst thing that ever happened to him in all his years of football.&lt;ref&gt;McKinstry p.411&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1970, the Colombian authorities re-opened the case but could find nothing to prove there had ever been a theft. Moore and Charlton had to attend a hearing at [[Bow Street Magistrates Court]] after which the case was formally closed in 1972. Despite being cleared the incident continued to dog Moore, and it has been suggested as a major reason why he was never awarded a [[knighthood]]. The Fuego Verde shop closed soon afterwards and Clara Padilla ended up fleeing to the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Dawson p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

A general consensus exists that the incident was an attempted frame-up, either to try to secure money from the England camp or possibly to have Moore ruled out of the World Cup, weakening England's chances of winning it. Another theory has occasionally been proposed, that a bracelet was taken by one of the other England players, possibly as part of a [[prank]], and that Moore took the blame to protect them. This was given credence by a comment that Moore made shortly before his death, that seemed to hint at this, when he told biographer [[Jeff Powell (author)|Jeff Powell]] "Perhaps one of the lads did something foolish, a prank with unfortunate consequences". However, this theory has been dismissed by Tina Moore, his wife at the time, and by Doctor Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;McKinstry p.412-413&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Touring Car Championship''' is a [[touring car racing]] series held each year in the United Kingdom, currently organised and administered by [[TOCA]]. It was established in 1958 as the '''British Saloon Car Championship''' and was renamed as the British Touring Car Championship for the [[1987 British Touring Car Championship|1987 season]].&lt;ref name=BTCC.net1958-1990&gt;[http://www.btcc.net/html/history.php BTCC History 1958-1990] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723000000/http://www.btcc.net/html/history.php |date=23 July 2013 }} Retrieved from www.btcc.net on 13 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The championship, currently running [[Next Generation Touring Car]] regulations, has been run to various national and international regulations over the years including [[FIA Group 2]], [[FIA Group 5]], [[FIA Group 1]], [[FIA Group A]], [[FIA Super Touring]] and [[FIA Super 2000]]. A lower-key [[Group N]] class for production cars ran from 2000 until 2003.

==History==
=== Early Years ===
[[Image:1958 Jack Sears.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Austin A105]] with which [[Jack Sears]] won the 1958 British Saloon Car Championship]]
The championship was initially run with a mix of classes, divided according to engine capacity, racing simultaneously. This often meant that a driver who chose the right class could win the overall championship without any chance of overall race wins, thereby devaluing the title for the spectators – for example, in the 1980s [[Chris Hodgetts]] won two overall titles in a small Toyota Corolla prepared by Hughes Of Beaconsfield, at that time a Mercedes-Benz/Toyota main dealer when most of the race wins were going to much larger cars; and while the [[Ford Sierra]] [[Cosworth]] RS500s were dominating at the front of the field, [[Frank Sytner]] took a title in a Class B [[BMW M3]] and [[John Cleland (racing driver)|John Cleland's]] first title was won in a small Class C [[Vauxhall Astra]].

=== Modern Era === 
==== Super Touring Cars ====
[[File:BTCC 2000 Ford.jpg|thumb|Ford won the championship in 2000, the final year running [[Super Touring]] regulations.]]
In 1990, the BTCC introduced a class for cars with an engine displacement up to 2.0 litres which would later be adopted by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] and become the [[Super Touring]] regulations that were used in various championships in Europe and around the world. In their first year, these cars were run alongside a second class which continued to allow larger engines and was once again dominated by the Ford Sierra Cosworth RS500, however from 1991 they became the only cars eligible to compete. The new one-class system was popular with manufacturers from the beginning with six manufacturer supported teams from BMW, Ford, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota and Vauxhall entered in the championship. During the first seasons, the cars weren't fitted with aerodynamic aids such as a front splitter or a rear wing which were allowed from 1995 after Alfa Romeo caused controversy a year earlier, when they entered the 155 fitted with a rear wing - an item that was delivered with the road-going version of the 155, however unfitted in its boot.
The continuously high number of manufacturer-backed teams meant rapid development on the cars and quickly growing costs to compete which caused several manufacturers to withdraw from the championship until the 2000 season, when only Ford, Honda and Vauxhall remained in the championship.
To this day, the 'super touring era' during the 1990s is still looked at as the most successful period of the BTCC. The high number of manufacturer-backed teams provided very close competition, close and hard-fought racing on track and many spectators at the circuits.&lt;ref name="Super Touring Years"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.btcc.net/history/in-depth/1991-2000/&amp;month=6&amp;year=2016&amp;form=browse&amp;searchterm= |title=BTCC history from 1991 to 2000 |publisher=British Touring Car Championship |work=btcc.net |date= |accessdate=10 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041901/http://www.btcc.net/history/in-depth/1991-2000/ |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== BTC Touring and Super 2000 cars ====
[[Image:BTCC Brands06 PaddockHill.jpg|thumb|250px|Previous generation [[BTC Touring]] cars racing at [[Brands Hatch]], April 2006]][[File:2011 BTCC Brands Hatch Neate, Onslow-Cole and Collard.jpg|thumb|250x250px|[[Touring Cars]] at a BTCC during race at [[Brands Hatch]], April 2011]] In order to reduce the costs to compete in the championship, the organisers introduced new regulations for the 2001 season. The [[BTC Touring]] regulations cut costs dramatically but both manufacturer and spectator interest was low. The [[Super 2000]] rules were adopted for the [[2007 British Touring Car Championship|2007 season]]. The 2000s saw cheaper cars than the later Supertouring era, with fewer factory teams and fewer international drivers.

==== Next Generation Touring Car ====
[[File:Andrew Jordan, Thruxton, Apr 2012 (practice).jpg|thumb|250x250px|[[Andrew Jordan (racing driver)|Andrew Jordan]] in his [[NGTC]] [[Honda Civic]] during practice at [[Thruxton Circuit]], April 2012]]
In 2009, the BTCC released details of its [[Next Generation Touring Car]] (NGTC) specification, to be introduced from 2011. The introduction of these new technical regulations were designed to dramatically reduce the design, build and running costs of the cars and engines as well as reducing the potential for significant performance disparities between cars. The NGTC specification also aimed to cut costs by reducing reliance on [[World Touring Car Championship|WTCC]]/[[Super 2000|S2000]] equipment, due to increasing costs/complexity and concerns as to its future sustainability and direction.&lt;ref name="Technical overview: NGTC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.btcc.net/html/generalnews_detail.php?id=1489&amp;month=6&amp;year=2009&amp;form=browse&amp;searchterm= |title=Technical overview: NGTC |publisher=British Touring Car Championship |work=btcc.net |date=2 June 2009 |accessdate=1 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219162914/http://www.btcc.net/html/generalnews_detail.php?id=1489&amp;month=6&amp;year=2009&amp;form=browse&amp;searchterm= |archivedate=19 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Current NGTC cars =====
Currently, the cars used are a mix of 2.0&amp;nbsp;L saloons (sedans) such as the Toyota Avensis and Chevrolet Cruze, station wagons (estates) such as the Subaru Levorg as well as hatchback cars such as the Honda Civic and Ford Focus, based on models from a variety of manufacturers, using [[NGTC]] regulations. S2000 cars continued running in the Jack Sears Trophy until the 2014 season. 

=== Teams ===
BTCC teams are a mixture of manufacturer entries (currently [[Honda]], [[MG Motor|MG]], [[BMW]], [[Vauxhall]] and [[Subaru]]) and independent teams such as [[BTC Norlin]], and [[Motorbase Performance]].

In 2010, following Vauxhall's decision to pull out of the series, there were two new works teams, : [[Chevrolet]], run by [[RML Group|RML]]; and [[Honda]], run by [[Team Dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btcc.net/html/generalnews_detail.php?id=1849&amp;month=3&amp;year=2010&amp;form=browse&amp;searchterm= A BTCC.NET Article.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304002428/http://www.btcc.net/html/generalnews_detail.php?id=1849&amp;month=3&amp;year=2010&amp;form=browse&amp;searchterm= |date=4 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2005 British Touring Car Championship|2005]], [[Team Dynamics]] became the first independent outfit to win the BTCC drivers and team championships; [[Matt Neal]] won the overall and independent drivers contests in his Team Dynamics Honda Integra. This included finishing all 30 championship races that year, something no other driver had achieved before and only equalled by Adam Morgan some 10 years later in 2015. This ended Vauxhall's run of 4 victories in the drivers and teams championships between 2001 and 2004. Neal and Dynamics were also victorious in 2006, before Vauxhall won the 2007 title with Italian [[Fabrizio Giovanardi]]. [[Team Dynamics]] also achieved the first overall independents race win in the 'Supertouring' era when Neal won a round of the 1999 BTCC at Donington park, earning the team prize-money of £250,000.

As a result of [[Matt Neal]]'s championship victories, and the fact that [[Team Dynamics]] were designing and building their own S2000 [[Honda Civic Type R]] (with unofficial support from [[Honda]]), they were no longer entered into the Independents category, and were classed as neither an "independent" or "works" team until the 2009 season, when the Manufacturers championship was renamed Manufacturers/Constructors Championship to allow both [[Arena Motorsport|Team Aon]] and [[Team Dynamics]] to compete with at the time the sole works entry of [[Vauxhall]].

==Car regulations==
[[File:BTCC DP08 Neal pit 3.jpg|thumb|250px|RIGHT|VXRacing Vectra being checked by the scrutineers]]

===Current regulations===
As of the [[2014 British Touring Car Championship]], all cars are built to the same regulations:
*'''[[Next Generation Touring Car]]'''. New set of regulations specifically developed for the BTCC as a way of moving the sport forward and cut costs for competitors. Introduced from [[2011 British Touring Car Championship|2011]], these new technical regulations were designed to dramatically reduce the design, build and running costs of the cars and engines as well as reduce reliance on WTCC/S2000 equipment. NGTC cars initially maintained performance parity with S2000 cars until the [[2013 British Touring Car Championship|2013 season]] when full NGTC cars became the main championship class with Hybrid S2000/NGTC cars running in a secondary class. From the [[2014 British Touring Car Championship|2014 season]], only NGTC cars are eligible to compete in the BTCC.

=== Cost control measures ===
There are strict limits to the modifications which can be made to the cars, which are intended to reduce the cost of running a competitive team, which had become prohibitive in the final years of the [[Super Touring]] rules. These cost reductions saw a rise in independent entries – teams or individuals entering cars purchased from the manufacturer teams when they update their chassis. 

With the introduction of the [[NGTC]] rules, all cars share a number of common components provided through a contract with [[RML Group]]. This has allowed many independent teams to enter without the need for manufacturer support, and negating the need to source ex-works cars.
Teams can install an engine from their marque's broad 'family' of cars, or opt to lease an engine from TOCA, built by Swindon Engines which also helps to make the cost of entry more affordable.

To further keep costs in check, the BTCC uses a single tyre supplier, with [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]] the current supplier of rubber to all the teams.  For dry races, the Dunlop SportMaxx Prime tyre is used, along with the use of the Option tyre (Soft/Hard) mandated at one race each meeting. For wet races, the Dunlop SportMaxx BluResponse tyre is used.

=== Fuels ===
The rules previously allowed for a variety of different fuels in a bid to encourage more efficient cars. In 2004 Mardi Gras Motorsport independently entered a [[Autogas|Liquified petroleum gas]] powered [[Honda Civic|Super 2000 Honda Civic Type-R]] (which was subsequently replaced by a more competitive [[Peugeot 406|BTC-Touring Peugeot 406 Coupé]], still LPG powered), and in 2005 Tech-Speed Motorsport converted an ex-works [[Vauxhall Astra|Vauxhall Astra Coupé]] to run on [[bio-ethanol]] fuel. In the middle of 2006, Kartworld's owner-driver [[Jason Hughes (auto racing)|Jason Hughes]] converted his 4-cylinder MG ZS to run on Bio-Ethanol, soon followed by the [[West Surrey Racing]] cars of championship contender [[Colin Turkington]] and [[Rob Collard]], and for the final event at Silverstone, [[Richard Marsh (racing driver)|Richard Marsh]] converted his Peugeot 307 to run on bio-ethanol fuel. Only Hughes continued on this fuel in 2007 and 2008.
The regulations also permitted cars to run on diesel; attempted first in the 2007 season by Rick Kerry in a BMW 120d E87 run by Team AFM Racing. In 2008 SEAT Sport UK entered two Turbo Diesel Power SEAT Leons – the first diesel powered manufacturer entered cars.
At the start of the 2010 season, it was announced that Team AON racing had converted both of their Ford Focus ST cars to run on LPG.

Under current NGTC regulations, all entrants use Carless HiperFlo 300 which is a 101/102 RON and 89/90 MON unleaded gasoline with approximately 2% oxygen content that meets the FIA ‘Appendix J’ gasoline specification.

*1991 to 2000 - 2 Litre Touring Car Formula, later becoming [[FIA Super Touring]]
*2001 to 2011 - [[BTC Touring]]. The BTCC developed and introduced this specification in [[2001 British Touring Car Championship|2001]], in response to the spiralling costs of the [[Super Touring]] specification. However, with the [[Super 2000]] specification being used in the newly reformed [[World Touring Car Championship]], the popularity of the BTC-T spec with top teams and manufactures was short lived. Therefore, from the [[2007 British Touring Car Championship|2007 season]], BTC-T spec cars were no longer allowed to win the championship outright. The 2010 season was meant to be the last year BTC-T cars would be eligible to enter the championship, however Series Director [[Alan Gow]] announced a one-year extension to allow BTC-T to compete in 2011 (with their base-weight +50&amp;nbsp;kg on the 2010 season). Only cars that competed in 2010 would be eligible to race in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Neil |last=Hudson |url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/article.php?id=5521 |title=BTC-spec cars get another year |publisher=touringcartimes.com |date= |accessdate=26 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717080150/http://www.touringcartimes.com/article.php?id=5521 |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*2004 to 2013 - [[Super 2000]]. Regulations first introduced to the BTCC in [[2004 British Touring Car Championship|2004]], allowing teams to build cars eligible to race in several different [[Touring car racing|Touring Car]] Championships, including the [[World Touring Car Championship]]. Car built to this specification were eligible to compete until the end of the [[2013 British Touring Car Championship|2013 season]], however the last fully S2000 cars were entered in the [[2011 British Touring Car Championship|2011 season]].
*2010 to 2013 - [[Super 2000|S2000]]/[[Next Generation Touring Car|NGTC]] Hybrid. From the [[2010 British Touring Car Championship|2010 season]], teams with S2000 chassis were allowed to use an NGTC engine with their car. As of the [[2012 British Touring Car Championship|2012 season]], all teams with S2000 chassis, used NGTC turbo charged engines. This hybrid specification was eligible until the end of the [[2013 British Touring Car Championship|2013 season]].

==Circuits==
[[File:BTCC Tracks 2012.png|thumb|Current circuits of the BTCC]]
Being a national championship, the British Touring Car Championship has visited circuits throughout the United Kingdom over its long history. Currently the series visits nine different tracks in England and Scotland over the course of ten meetings. These tracks are: [[Brands Hatch]] (Indy Layout), [[Donington Park]], [[Thruxton Circuit]] (the fastest track ever visited by the BTCC, with an average speed of 111.31&amp;nbsp;mph, set by [[Andrew Jordan (racing driver)|Andrew Jordan]] during qualifying in 2014), [[Oulton Park]], [[Croft Circuit]], [[Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit]], [[Knockhill Racing Circuit]], [[Rockingham Motor Speedway]] and [[Silverstone Circuit]] with a return to Brands Hatch (GP Layout) at the end of the season.

In the past, the BTCC has visited [[Mondello Park]] in Ireland and [[Pembrey Circuit]] in Wales. A street race around the city of Birmingham known as the [[Birmingham Superprix]], was held in [[1989 British Touring Car Championship|1989]] and [[1990 British Touring Car Championship|1990]]. [[Aintree Motor Racing Circuit]], [[Crystal Palace circuit]] and [[Goodwood Circuit]] have all hosted rounds in the past.

==Race format==
[[File:Plato + Giovanardi Snetterton 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Championship contenders Jason Plato (SEAT) and Fabrizio Giovanardi (Vauxhall) collide during a BTCC race at Snetterton in July 2007. The BTCC is known for being a high-contact series.&lt;ref name="Herbert"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/herbert-goes-back-to-his-roots-after-horror-crash-1779277.html|title=Herbert goes back to his roots after horror crash|last=Briggs|first=Gemma|date=30 August 2009|work=The Independent|accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On the Saturday of a race weekend there are two practice sessions followed by a 30-minute qualifying session which determines the starting order for the first race on the Sunday, the fastest driver lining up in [[pole position]].

Each race typically consists of between 16 and 25 laps, depending on the length of the circuit. A race may be extended by three laps if three or more laps have been run behind a safety car.

The grid for race two is based on the finishing order of race one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btcc.net/about/key-rules-and-regulations/ |title=Key rules and regulations |publisher=BTCC |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; For race three, a draw takes place to decide at which place the grid is 'reversed'. This means drivers finishing race two in positions 6th through 12th could take pole position for race 3 depending on the outcome of the draw. For example, if ball number 7 is drawn, the driver finishing in 7th position in race two starts on pole, 6th place starts in second place, 5th place starts in third etc. Drivers finishing in 8th place and beyond would start race three in their finishing order for race two. The draw is normally conducted by a celebrity or VIP, live on TV. For 2014, this was changed so that the driver who finished Race 2 in 10th position made the draw. Fabrizio Giovanardi has twice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mjp-media.com/articles/2014/btcc05/race2m.shtml|title=British Touring Car Championship Croft - Race 2 Report - 29/6/14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btccpages.com/news/1/2490/Turkington-wins-tough-third-Thruxton-race/|title=Turkington wins tough third Thruxton race}}&lt;/ref&gt; managed to put himself on pole position by drawing out number 10.

Before 2006, the driver finishing in 10th place in race two took pole position for race three. This initiated deliberate race 'fixing', whereby some drivers attempted to finished in 10th place during race two to gain pole position in race three. This "reverse grid" rule polarised opinion: some fans enjoy the spectacle afforded by having unlikely drivers on pole position while faster ones have to battle through the field; others feel it detracts from the purity of the racing. For example, some drivers might decide to slow down and let others pass them, thereby improving their own starting position for the "reverse grid" race, which is contrary to the spirit of motor racing – which is to try to come first in every race. It also led to some safety concerns as drivers would slow dramatically on the approach to the finish line, with cars behind forced to take evasive action to avoid collecting slower cars ahead. These factors contributed the rule change for the [[2006 British Touring Car Championship|2006 season]].

==Television coverage==
The [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] screened highlights of every race from 1988 to 2001. The [[F1]] commentator at the time, [[Murray Walker]], commentated. From 1997, some races were screened live with [[Charlie Cox (racing)|Charlie Cox]] joining Murray Walker. After 1997 the commentary team was Charlie Cox and John Watson with Murray Walker dedicating his time to Formula 1.

In the UK, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] covered the series from 2002, with commentary from [[Ben Edwards (commentator)|Ben Edwards]] and former champion [[Tim Harvey]], with [[Toby Moody]] replacing Edwards after he replaced [[Martin Brundle]] on the BBC's F1 coverage in 2012 and David Addison replaced Toby Moody&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crash.net/btcc/news/188476/1/itv-names-new-btcc-commentator.html Addison named new BTCC commentator | BTCC News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; for the 2013 season. In 2006 the [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] coverage included highlights from the first and second race of the day and live coverage of the third and final race. This returned in the second half of 2007, after the first five meetings had been on [[ITV3]] (a digital channel with fewer viewers), with a half-hour late-night highlights show. ITV also has a Sunday night show called [[Motorsport UK]], featuring many of the supporting races. From 2008, the races were screened live on ITV4, along with the support races. ITV has a one-hour highlights programme on the Monday night following the race.

The series is screened in other countries. In Australia, [[Fox Sports Australia]] have been covering the BTCC championship since 2000. From 2009 the ITV coverage has screened on [[ONE HD]]. [[Speed TV]] screened several seasons in the USA over the winter, but this ended when the network became [[Fox Sports 1]] in 2013. BTCC returned to the air in the US with the 2015 season, being aired on [[CBS Sports Network]] in condensed, one-hour packages like those aired on Speed. Unlike Speed's offering as the series being winter programming filling the void after the American racing season, CBSSN airs events a week or so after their actual running.

[[Motors TV]] used to show all the races live, including some support races, both in the UK and across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motors TV|url=http://www.motorstv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Setanta Sports showed all the races live, including the support races; this ceased when the entire day's coverage moved to [[ITV4]].

==Previous champions==
{{main article|List of BTCC champions}}

Currently, five championships are awarded per season. The overall driver's championship is the driver gaining the most points overall throughout the season. Since 1992, the Independents driver championship has also been awarded to the leading non-manufacturer-backed driver. There are also awards for the best overall team, leading manufacturer and, since 2005, the top independent team. Previous championship titles were awarded to the leading "Production" (or "Class B") driver and team between 2000 and 2003. The Jack Sears Trophy was introduced for the 2013 season and was awarded to the highest scoring driver comping in S2000 machinery. For 2014, with S2000 cars no longer eligible to compete, it was awarded to the drive that had made up the most places from their grid position throughout the season. From the 2015 season the Jack Sears Trophy has been awarded to the highest placed rookie driver at the end of the season. For the 60th anniversary year in 2018, any driver who had yet to take an overall podium was eligible to contest the Jack Sears Trophy.

==Support races==
Each BTCC race meeting, the crowds are kept further entertained by the appearance of high-profile supporting championships, known as the [[TOCA|TOCA Support Package]], from the manufacturers [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Ginetta Cars|Ginetta]], [[Porsche]] and [[Renault]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btcc.net/html/supportraces.php BTCC.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304002347/http://www.btcc.net/html/supportraces.php |date=4 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TOCA support package===

[[File:Ginetta G50 Cup.jpg|thumb|right|A Ginetta G50 Supercup car.]]
[[Image:Carrera cup field.jpg|thumb|right|Porsche Carrera Cup GB Race at Donington Park]]
The [[TOCA|TOCA Support Package]] consists of five main support championships, which support the championship at almost every round, along with several smaller championships supporting one or two events. All the support championships are either [[One-Design|Single Make Championships]] or [[Formula racing]].

After previously supported the BTCC in the late 1990s and then in [[2013 British Formula Ford Championship|2013]] and [[2014 British Formula Ford Championship|2014]], the [[British Formula Ford Championship]] announced that it was folding to become the [[F4 British Championship|MSA Formula]], the [[FIA]]'s [[Formula 4]] championship in the UK for the [[2015 MSA Formula Championship|2015 season]]. Known as [[F4 British Championship]] from [[2016 F4 British Championship|2016]], the championship uses [[Mygale]] carbon-fibre monocoque chassis and  a [[Ford]] 1.6L [[EcoBoost]] engine as used in the more modern [[Formula Ford]] cars.&lt;ref name="New MSA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Scott|title=New UK FIA Formula 4 series MSA Formula to use Mygale chassis|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/115898|website=Autosport.com|publisher=Haymarket Media|accessdate=16 November 2014|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[Ginetta GT Supercup]] is a GT style, multi class championship. The main class is the [[Ginetta G55|G55]] class, utilising [[Ginetta Cars|Ginetta's]] G55 car. The second class, known as the G50 class, utilises the older and less powerful [[Ginetta G50]]. Most weekends in 2013 see three Supercup races with a few rounds hosting only two races. Ginetta also run a championship on the support package that caters for up and coming young talent in the form of the [[Ginetta Junior Championship]]. These 14- to 17-year-olds race in identical [[Ginetta G40J]] cars with strict regulations which help keep costs down. In 2013, the championship with run two races at all BTCC weekends.

Out of all the current support series, the [[Porsche Carrera Cup GB]] is the longest serving support championship. Drivers compete in identical [[Porsche 911 GT3|Porsche 911 GT3 Cup (Type 997)]] cars which produce 450&amp;nbsp;bhp. The three tier championship splits drivers according to their racing experience. Professional drivers compete in the Pro class, with semi-professional and amateur drivers racing in either Pro-Am1 or Pro-Am2. In 2013, the Carrera Cup will hold two races at each BTCC meeting.

Finally, the [[Renault Clio Cup United Kingdom|Renault Clio Cup UK]] allows aspiring touring car drivers to showcase their talent in this single make series, utilising [[Renault Clio Renault Sport|Clio Renaultsport 200]] cars. The championship awards three different titles for drivers. Along with the overall drivers’ championship, younger rookie drivers can chase points for the Graduate Cup and older gentlemen drivers can seek points for the Masters Cup. During 2013, the Clio Cup will hold two races at all BTCC weekends except the rounds at [[Croft Circuit|Croft]] and [[Knockhill Racing Circuit|Knockhill]].

'''Clarence Park Festival''' is the longest running free music festival in Yorkshire, England. Known initially as '''Clarence Rocks Off'''&lt;ref name="themusiccollective1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themusiccollective.co.uk/about-us/a-history-of-the-collective/ |title=A History Of The Collective &amp;#124; Wakefield Music Collective |publisher=Themusiccollective.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been held annually at the bandstand in [[Clarence Park, Wakefield|Clarence Park]], [[Wakefield]] since 1991.&lt;ref name="themusiccollective1"/&gt;

It is the flagship event for [http://www.themusiccollective.co.uk Wakefield Music Collective], a non-profit community group with open membership. Estimated attendance of the festival ranges between 2,000 and 8,000 depending on weather, and it is funded largely through grants, corporate sponsorship and other fundraising events throughout the year.

The 23rd Festival is taking place on the weekend of 26 and 27 July 2014. During the two days the Festival will showcase a host of bands as well as craft and food stalls, and a beer tent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themusiccollective.co.uk/clarence-2014/ |title=Clarence 2014 &amp;#124; Wakefield Music Collective |publisher=Themusiccollective.co.uk |date=24 April 2014 |accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist selection process==
Most artists are chosen by The Music Collective via a democratic application process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themusiccollective.co.uk/playclarence |title=Want To Play Clarence? &amp;#124; Wakefield Music Collective |publisher=Themusiccollective.co.uk |date=8 April 2014 |accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which invites bands to apply via a post or an online portal. Selection takes place in April, followed by a press launch in May. The event is traditionally opened each day by a Wakefield-based act. There are no hard-and-fast rules on which genres are allowed to apply or play.

Alongside local acts, over the years the lineup has included, [[Dodgy]], [[Eddie and The Hot Rods]], [[Zodiac Mindwarp &amp; The Love Reaction]], [[John Otway]] and [[The Cribs]]' first band Wrinkle.

'''Deconstruction Tour''' was a one-day [[Punk rock|punk music]] and [[Skateboarding|skate]] festival that was staged in various countries across [[Europe]]. It first took place in 1999 and occurred annually until 2006. The tour was arranged by Destiny Tourbooking. In general, the tour offered the opening slot of each day to a local, often unsigned band, with the following acts increasing in notability throughout the lineup. The festival also included displays by [[BMX]] riders and skaters.

Aside from the first year, 2006 was possibly the least successful for the tour, due to problems with booking bands and the limited number of dates that were booked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumromanum.de/member/forum/forum.php?action=ubb_show&amp;entryid=1096422174&amp;mainid=1096422174&amp;USER=user_56940&amp;threadid=2 Explanation - Deconstruction Tour Forum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The tour has not gone ahead since 2006.

'''Ecological extinction''' is "the reduction of a [[species]] to such low abundance that, although it is still present in the [[Community (ecology)|community]], it no longer interacts significantly with other species".&lt;ref name="Estes 1989"/&gt; 

Ecological extinction stands out because it is the interaction ecology of a species that is important for conservation work.  They state that "unless the species interacts significantly with other species in the community (e.g. it is an important [[predator]], competitor, [[symbiont]], [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualist]], or prey) its loss may result in little to no adjustment to the abundance and population structure of other species".&lt;ref name="Estes 1989"/&gt; 

This view stems from the neutral model of communities that assumes there is little to no interaction within species unless otherwise proven.

Estes, Duggins, and Rathburn (1989) recognize two other distinct types of extinction:
*Global [[extinction]] is defined as "the ubiquitous disappearance of a species".&lt;ref name="Estes 1989"&gt;Estes et al. ''[https://courses.pbsci.ucsc.edu/eeb/bioe161/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Estes-James.-The-Ecology-of-Extinctions-in-Kelp-Forest-Communities.pdf The ecology of extinctions in kelp forest communities].''  Conservation Biology.  3:  252-264. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Local extinction]] is characterized by "the disappearance of a species from part of its natural range".&lt;ref name="Estes 1989"/&gt;

== Keystone species ==
{{Main article|Keystone species}}
[[Image:red-knobbed.starfish.arp.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Paine first established the concept of a keystone species by studying the sea star.]] 
[[Robert Paine (zoologist)|Robert Paine]] (1969) first came up with the concept of a [[keystone species]] while studying the effects of the predatory [[sea star]]  ''[[Pisaster ochraceus]]'', on the abundance of the herbivorous gastropod, ''[[Tegula funebralis]]''.  This study took place in the [[Intertidal zone|rocky intertidal]] habitat off the coast of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]; Paine removed all ''Pisaster'' in 8m x 10m plots weekly while noting the response of ''Tegula'' for two years.  He found that removing the top predator, in this case being ''Pisaster'', reduced species number in the treatment plots.  Paine defined the concept of a keystone species as a species that has a disproportionate effect on the community structure of an environment in relation to its total biomass.  This keystone species effect forms the basis for the concept of ecological extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, R. T.  ''[http://www.academia.edu/download/31410212/paine_tegula.pdf The pisaster-tegula interaction:  Prey patches, predator food preference, and intertidal community structure].''  Ecology.  6:  950-961. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples  ==
[[Image:sea otter cropped.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sea otters maintain the overall biodiversity of the kelp forest community.]]
Estes et al. (1978) evaluated the potential role of the [[sea otter]] as the keystone predator in near-shore [[kelp forests]].  They compared the Rat and Near islands in the Aleutian islands to test if "sea otter predation controls epibenthic invertebrate populations (specifically sea urchins), and in turn releases the vegetation association from intense grazing".&lt;ref name="Estes 1978"&gt;Estes et al. ''[https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2307/1938786 Sea otter predation and community organization in the western Aleutian Islands, Alaska].''  Ecology.  59:  822-833. 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;  Estes and his colleagues found that different size structures and densities of sea urchins were correlated with the presence of sea otter populations, and because they are the principal prey of this keystone predator, the sea otters were most likely the main determinants of the differences in [[sea urchin]] populations.  With high sea otter densities the [[herbivory]] of sea urchins in these kelp forest was severely limited, and this made [[Competition (biology)|competition]] between algal species the main determinant in survival.  However, when sea otters were absent, herbivory of the sea urchins was greatly intensified to the point of decimation of the kelp forest community.  This loss of heterogeneity serves as a loss of habitat for both fish and eagle populations that depend on the richly productive kelp forest environment.  Historical [[over harvesting]] of sea otter furs has severely restricted their once wide-ranging habitat, and only today are scientists starting to see the implications of these local extinctions.  Conservation work needs to focus on finding the density threshold that render the sea otters an effective population.  It must then continue and artificially repopulate the historical range of the sea otter in order to allow kelp forest communities to re-establish.&lt;ref name="Estes 1978"/&gt;

The [[California spiny lobster]], or ''Panulirus interruptus'', is another example of a keystone predator that has a distinct role in maintaining species diversity in its habitat.  Robles (1987) demonstrated experimentally that the exclusion of spiny lobsters from the intertidal zone habitats led to the competitive dominance of [[mussel]]s (''Mytilus edulis'' and ''M. californianus'').  This results shows another example of how the ecological extinction of a keystone predator can reduce species diversity in an ecosystem.  Unfortunately, the threshold of ecological extinction has long passed due to over fishing now that many local extinctions of the California spiny lobster are common.&lt;ref&gt;Robles, C.  ''[https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1939234 Predator foraging characteristics and prey population structure on a sheltered shore].''  Ecology.  65:  1502-1514. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jackson et al. (2001) took a much needed historical perspective on the role of ecological extinction caused by [[overfishing]] of oysters in the [[Chesapeake Bay]].  Commercial oyster fishing had not affected the bay ecosystem until mechanical dredges for harvesting were utilized in the 1870s.  The bay today is plagued by [[eutrophication]] due to algal blooms, and the resulting water is highly [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]].  These algal blooms have competitively excluded any other species from surviving, including the rich diversity in faunal life that once flourished such as dolphins, manatees, river otters, sea turtles, alligators, sharks, and rays.  This example highlights the top-down loss of diversity commercial fishing has on marine ecosystems by removing the keystone species of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson et al.  ''[http://copa.acguanacaste.ac.cr:8080/bitstream/handle/11606/234/Sobrepesca-pdf.pdf?sequence=1 Historical overfishing and the recent collapse of coastal ecosystems].''  Science.  293(5530):  629-638. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Invasive species ==
Novaro et al. (2000) assessed the potential ecological extinction of [[guanacos]] (''Lama guanicoe'') and [[lesser rhea]]s (''Pterocnemia pennata'')  as a prey source for native omnivores and predators in the [[Argentine Patagonia]].  These native species are being replaced by introduced species such as the [[European rabbit]], [[red deer]], and [[domestic cattle]]; the cumulative damage from the increased herbivory by introduced species has also served to accelerate destruction of  the already dwindling Argentine [[pampa]]s and [[steppe]] habitats.  This was the first study to take into account a large number of diverse predators, ranging from [[skunks]] to [[cougar|pumas]], as well as conduct their survey in non-protected areas that represent the majority of southern South America.  Novaro and his colleagues found that the entire assemblage of native carnivores relied primarily on [[introduced species]] as a prey base.  They also suggested that the lesser rhea and guanaco had already passed their ecological effective density as a prey species, and thus were ecological extinct.  It is possible that the niches of introduced species as herbivores too closely mirrored those of the natives, and thus competition was the primary cause of ecological extinction.  The effect of introduction of new competitors, such as the red deer and rabbit, also served to alter the vegetation in the habitat, which could have further pronounced the intensity of competition.  Guanacos and rheas have been classified as a low risk for global extinction, but this simplistic view of their demography doesn't take into account that they have already become functionally extinct in the Argentine Patagonia.  Novaro and his colleagues suggest "this loss could have strong effects on plant-animal interactions, nutrient dynamics, and disturbance regimes&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Novaro 1999"&gt;Novaro et al. ''[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320799000658 Ecological extinction of native prey of a carnivore assemblage in Argentine Patagonia].''  Biological Conservation.  92. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a prime example of how current conservation policy has already failed to protect the intended species because of its lack of a functionally sound definition for extinction.&lt;ref name="Novaro 1999"/&gt;

[[Image:Linepithema Argentine ant.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Christian found Argentine ants to disrupt large seed dispersal mutualisms.]]
Seed dispersal mechanisms play a fundamental role in the regeneration and continuation of community structure, and a recent study by Christian (2001) demonstrated a shift in the composition of the plant community in the [[South African]] shrublands following an invasion by the [[Argentine ant]] ''(Linepithema humile)''.  Ants disperse up to 30% of the flora in the shrublands and are vital to the survival of [[fynbos]] plants because they bury the large seeds away from the dangers of predation and fire damage.  It is also crucial for seeds to be buried, because nearly all seed germination takes place in the first season after a fire.  Argentine ants, a recent invader, do not disperse even small seeds.  Christian tested whether the invasion of the Argentine ant differentially effected small and large-seeded fauna.  He found that post-fire recruitment of large-seeded flora was reduced disproportionately for large seeds in sites already invaded by Argentine ants.  These initial low large-seed density recruitments will eventually lead the domination of small-seeded fauna in invaded habitats.  The consequences of this change in community structure highlight the struggle for dispersal of large-seeded flora that have potential reverberations around the world because ants are major ecological seed dispersers throughout the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Christian, C. E. ''[https://www.nature.com/articles/35098093 Consequences of biological invasion the importance of mutualism for plant communities].''  Nature.  413:  635-640. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modeling ecological extinction ==
[[Image:Flying bat with tree orig.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Below a certain density threshold, flying foxes are no longer effective seed dispersers.]]
The McConkey and Drake (2006) study is unique because it was one of the first attempts to model a density-dependent threshold relationship that described ecological extinction.  They studied a seed dispersal interaction between flying foxes and trees with large seeds on the tropical Pacific Islands.  Insular flying foxes (''[[Pteropus tonganus]])'', are considered to be keystone species because they are the only seed dispersers that can carry large seeds long distances.  The host-pathogen model by Janzen and Connell suggests that survivorship of seeds in the tropics greatly increases the further away from the parent tree it lands, and that trees require this dispersal in order to avoid extinction.  In the pathogen latent environment of the tropics, seed dispersal only becomes more paramount to species survival.  As hypothesized, McConkey and Drake found a threshold relationship between the Flying Fox Index (FFI) and the median proportion of seeds carried over five meters.  Below the threshold of abundance seed dispersal was insignificant and independent of flying fox abundance; however, above the threshold, dispersal positively correlated with increased flying fox abundance (as measured by the FFI).  Although they did not directly prove the cause for this relationship, McConkey and Drake proposed a behavioral mechanism.  Flying foxes are known to be territorial, and in the absence of competition a flying fox will eat within one tree, effectively dropping the seeds right below it.  Alternatively, if there is a high density of flying foxes feeding at one time (abundance above the threshold density) then aggressive behavior, such as stealing fruit from another individual's territory, will lead to longer average seed dispersal.  In this way the seed dispersing flying fox has a disproportional effect on the overall community structure in comparison to their relative biomass.  Modeling the effect of ecological extinction on communities is the first step to applying this framework into conservation work.&lt;ref name="McConkey, K. R. 2006"&gt;McConkey, K. R.,  &amp; Drake, D. R.  ''[https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/05-0386 Flying foxes cease to function as seed dispersers long before they become rare].''  Ecology.  87(2):  271-276. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

While ecologists are just starting to get a grapple on the significant interactions within an ecosystem, they must continue to find an effective density threshold that can maintain the level of equilibrium species diversity.  Only with this knowledge of where and to what extent a specific species interacts with its environment will the proper and most efficient levels of conservation work take place.  This work is especially important on the limited ecosystems of islands, where there are less likely to be replacement species for specific niches.  With species diversity and available habitat decreasing rapidly worldwide, identifying the systems that are most crucial to the ecosystem will be the crux of conservation work.&lt;ref name="McConkey, K. R. 2006"/&gt;

== Climate change ==
[[Climate change]] has produced numerous shifts in the distributions and abundances of species.  Thomas et al. (2004) went on to assess the extinction risk due to these shifts over a broad range of global habitats.  Their [[predictive modelling|predictive model]] using midline estimates for climate warming over the next 50 years suggests that 15–37% of species will be "committed to extinction" by 2050.  Although the average global temperature has risen .6°C, individual populations and habitats will only respond to their local changes in climate.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas et al.  ''Extinction risk from climate change.''  Nature.  427:  145-149. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Root et al. (2002) suggests that local changes in climate may account for density changes in regions, shifts in [[phenology]] (timing) of events, changes in [[morphology (biology)]] (such as body size), and shifts in genetic frequencies.  They found that there have been an average phenological shift of 5.1 days earlier in the spring for a broad range of over a thousand compiled studies.  This shift was also, as predicted, more pronounced in the upper latitudes that have concurrently had the largest shift in local average temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Root et al.  ''[http://www.uni-landau.de/umwelt/study/content/files/archiv/H.Schulz/WS09/Biodiversitaet_und_Naturschutz/Root%20et%20al%202003.pdf Fingerprints of global warming on wild animals and plants].''  Nature.  421:  57-60. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the loss of habitat, loss of pollinator mutualisms, and the effect of introduced species all have distinct pressures on native populations, these effects must be looked underneath a synergistic and not an independent framework.  Climate change has the potential to exacerbate all of these processes.  Nehring (1999) found a total of 16 non-indigenous thermophilic [[phytoplankton]] established in habitats northwards of their normal range in the North Sea.  He likened these changes in range of more southerly phytoplankton to climatic shifts in ocean temperature.  All of these effects have additive effects to the stress on populations within an environment, and with the additionally fragile and more complete definition of ecological extinction must be taken into account into preventative conservation measures.&lt;ref&gt;Nehring, S.  ''[https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/55/4/818/2055166/55-4-818.pdf Establishment of thermophilic phytoplankton species in the North Sea:  biological indicators of climatic changes?]''  ICES Journal of Marine Science.  55:  818-823. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications for conservation policy ==
{{Unbalanced|section|date=January 2017|It reads like an environmental activist website}}
[[Conservation policy]] has historically lagged behind current science all over the world, but at this critical juncture politicians must make the effort to catch up before massive extinctions occur on our planet.  For example, the pinnacle of American conservation policy, the [[Endangered Species Act]] of 1973, fails to acknowledge any benefit for protecting highly interactive species that may help maintain overall species diversity.  Policy must first assess whether the species in question is considered highly interactive by asking the questions "does the absence or loss of this species, either directly or indirectly, incur a loss of overall diversity, effect the reproduction or recruitment of other species, lead to a change in habitat structure, lead to a change in productivity or nutrient dynamics between ecosystems, change important ecological processes, or reduce the resilience of the ecosystem to disturbances?".&lt;ref name="Soulé 2005"&gt;Soulé et al. ''[https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-pdf/55/2/168/19413723/55-2-168.pdf Strongly interacting species:  conservation policy, management, and ethics].''  Bioscience.  55(2):  168-176. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  After these multitudes of questions are addressed to define an interactive species, an ecologically effective density threshold must be estimated in order to maintain this interaction ecology.  This process holds many of the same variables contained within viable population estimates, and thus should not be difficult to incorporate into policy.  To avoid [[mass extinction]] on a global scale unlike anyone has seen before, scientists must understand all of the mechanisms driving the process.  It is now that the governments of the world must act in order to prevent this catastrophe of the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] from progressing further and wasting all of the time and money spent on previous conservation efforts.&lt;ref name="Soulé 2005"/&gt;

{{campaignbox Sudanese nomadic conflicts}}

'''Ethnic violence in South Sudan''' has a long history among [[South Sudan]]'s varied [[Demographics of South Sudan#Ethnic groups|ethnic groups]]. South Sudan has 64 tribes&lt;ref name=guardian1215/&gt; with the largest being the [[Dinka people|Dinka]]s, who constitute about 35% of the population&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{CIA World Factbook link|od|South Sudan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and predominate in government. The second largest are the [[Nuer people|Nuer]]s. Conflict is often aggravated among nomadic groups over the issue of cattle and grazing land and is part of the wider [[Sudanese nomadic conflicts]].

In 2010, [[Dennis C. Blair|Dennis Blair]], then United States [[Director of National Intelligence]], issued a warning that "over the next five years,...a new mass killing or genocide is most likely to occur in southern Sudan."&lt;ref name=Abramowitz&gt;{{cite news | last = Abramowitz | first = Michael |author2=Lawrence Woocher | title = How Genocide Became a National Security Threat | work = Foreign Policy | accessdate = 2013-02-12 | date = 2010-02-26| url = https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/02/26/how_genocide_became_a_national_security_threat }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aljazeera&gt;{{cite news|title=Sudan: Transcending tribe |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/photo_galleries/africa/201111010324526960.html |work=[[Al Jazeera English]] |accessdate=30 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317113359/http://english.aljazeera.net//photo_galleries/africa/201111010324526960.html |archivedate=17 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, [[Priti Patel]], the [[Secretary of State for International Development|Secretary]] of the United Kingdom's [[Department for International Development]], declared the violence in South Sudan as genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/south-sudan-africa-genocide-uk-priti-patel-un-violence-a7681361.html|title=UK goes beyond UN to say South Sudan violence 'is now genocide'|date=12 April 2017|accessdate=15 April 2017|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

===Nomadic raiding===
{{See also|Sudanese nomadic conflicts|Cattle raiding}}
Those from the [[Murle people|Murle]] and the [[Lou Nuer]] are largely nomadic cattle herders. [[Cattle]] are used as food and are used as a store of wealth. It takes 20 cows to buy a bride if a young man hopes to marry, which encourages [[cattle raiding]]. Violence between the two groups go back generations, exacerbated by tensions over land and water. The attacks often target an entire village, burning them in their round thatched huts. Militias frequently abduct children during cattle raids, who are then raised as their own. This is seen as a method, notably among the Murle, to increase the numbers of the small minority group. In past generations, attacks used machetes and sticks. However, after decades of civil war, the region is awash with guns, and young men are now armed with high-powered weapons.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-ethiopia-massacre-20160420-story.html|title=Why hundreds of people are dying over cattle in East Africa|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, local organizations said that more than 5,000 people were killed since 2011 in cattle raids in South Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/south-sudan-cattle-raids-170205090102703.html|title=Thousands killed in cattle raids since 2011|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=5 February 2017|date=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sudan People's Liberation Army===
The governing party, the [[Sudan People's Liberation Movement]] (SPLM), and the army, the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA), have been accused of being dominated by the Dinka. Many refer to the dominance of Dinkas as the "Dinkocracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/12/south-sudan-teeters-brink-20131217131843385823.html|title=South Sudan teeters on the brink|date=17 December 2013|accessdate=15 April 2017|work=Aljazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Dinka lobbying group known as the "Jieng Council of Elders" is often accused of being behind hardline SPLM policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/dinka-council-elders-welcomes-kiir’s-decision-firing-ministers-allied-machar|title=Dinka council of elders welcomes Kiir’s decision firing ministers allied to Machar|date=4 August 2016|accessdate=9 March 2017|work=Radio Tamazuj}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article59719|title=Jieng Council of Elders caused "coup" in SPLM-IO: official|date=24 July 2015|accessdate=9 March 2017|work=Sudan Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the army used to attract men from across tribes, during the South Sudanese Civil War, the SPLA had largely become a militia of soldiers from the Dinka stronghold of [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]], home region of President Kiir and the Chief of Staff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/opinion/south-sudan-cannot-be-allowed-to-collapse.html?_r=1|title=South Sudan must not be allowed to collapse|date=20 January 2017|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the army was often referred to within the country as "the Dinka army".&lt;ref name=bbcnews0317/&gt; Much of the worst atrocities committed are blamed on a group known as "[[Mathiang Anyoor]]" (Brown caterpillar) or "Dot Ke Beny" (Rescue the President), a militia of Dinkas formed to protect Kiir and [[Paul Malong Awan]], while the SPLA claim that it is just another battalion.&lt;ref name=africanarguments&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africanarguments.org/2016/07/11/whos-behind-south-sudans-return-to-fighting/|title=Who's behind South Sudan's return to fighting?|date=11 July 2016|accessdate=26 January 2017|work=African arguments}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcnews0317&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39209280|title=South Sudan conflict: 'Soldiers will kill you for no reason in Yei'|first=Alastair|last=Leithead|date=9 March 2017|accessdate=9 March 2017|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Sudan Democratic Movement===
The [[South Sudan Democratic Movement]] (SSDM) is a rebel group founded in 2010 by [[George Athor]] after he lost a contested election. The group also incorporates and supports other factions as part of a broad coalition of those who complain of neglect by the Dinka dominated SPLA. This notably includes those composed of ethnic minorities such as the [[Murle people]] who lead the Cobra faction and the [[Shilluk people]] who lead the Upper Nile Faction.

== Murle-Nuer fighting ==
===Uror massacre (2011)===
On 18 August 2011, an attack in Uror County, northern [[Jonglei]] was reportedly launched by Murle tribesmen after armed groups infiltrated into the Peiri and Pulchuol Districts (Payams) at about 5 a.m. The attack is believed to have been a revenge operation against the Lou Nuer tribe after an attack on the Murle the previous June in Pibor County. At least 640 people were killed and the attackers burned down over 3,400 houses and the hospital run by [[Médecins Sans Frontières]]. An initial estimate showed that 38,000 heads of cattle were stolen and 208 children were kidnapped.&lt;ref name=TribuneCattle&gt;{{cite web|title=Hundreds dead' in South Sudan cattle raids |url=http://www.sudantribune.com/Hundreds-killed-in-South-Sudan-s,39887 |publisher=Sudan Tribune |accessdate=23 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829155651/http://www.sudantribune.com/Hundreds-killed-in-South-Sudan-s,39887 |archivedate=29 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murle-Dinka fighting ==

===Sudanese Civil Wars===
As early as 1963, during the [[First Sudanese Civil War]], Khartoum began arming the Murle tribe, traditional enemies of both Dinka and Nuer, to fight the southern rebellion. Sometimes, whole tribal territories became affiliated with one side or the other, and the vicious north-south war became a defining factor in relations between tribes, infusing old hostilities with a new, political dimension. With the peace deal in 2005, tribal militias chose to either be absorbed into the SPLA or head north and join the armed forces there. Most chose to join their former SPLA enemies as a matter of survival. Others, like fighters from the Murle tribe, chose to join the northern army. Today, there are many Murle army officers in Khartoum, and they say the tribe is being punished for that.&lt;ref name=aljazeera/&gt;

== Shilluk-Dinka fighting ==

===Shilluk disarmament campaign (2010)===
Many from the [[Shilluk people]] contend that the Dinka as well as the Dinka and Nuer soldiers from the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] committed abuses in an attempt to disarm them in the summer of 2010. The SPLA burned scores of villages, raped hundreds of women and girls and killed an untold number of civilians in the [[Shilluk Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=aljazeera/&gt; Over 10,000 people were displaced in the midst of the rainy season and sent fleeing into the forest, often naked, without bedding, shelter or food, with many children dying from hunger and cold. Civilians alleging [[torture]] by the SPLA claim fingernails being torn out, burning plastic bags dripped on children to make their parents hand over weapons and villagers burned alive in their huts if rebels were suspected of spending the night there. The [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] reported many of these violations, and the frustrated director of one [[Juba]]-based international aid agency called them "human rights abuses off the [[Richter scale]]".&lt;ref name=aljazeera/&gt;

[[John Uliny]] from the Shilluk people lead the [[South Sudan Democratic Movement#SSDM/A-Upper Nile faction|Upper Nile faction]] of the South Sudan Democratic Movement in rebellion. In March 2011, in clashes between the Uliny's Upper Nile faction and the SPLA North of Malakal, the SSDM claimed that the SPLA killed 168 civilians and named six villages that the SPLA burned down.&lt;ref name=Tribune7M&gt;{{cite news|last=Tribune |first=Sudan |title=South Sudan army clashes with rebel group, over 100 dead |url=http://www.sudantribune.com/South-Sudan-army-clashes-with,38227 |accessdate=5 January 2012 |newspaper=Sudan Tribune |date=8 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129145059/https://www.sudantribune.com/South-Sudan-army-clashes-with,38227 |archivedate=29 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] later confirmed that over 60 ethnic Shilluk were killed, and more than 7,000 displaced.

Uliny entered into peace talks and accepted an amnesty by the government in 2013. However, during the civil war, after Kiir's floated the idea of carving new states which would give Kiir's Dinkas strong majorities and which the Shilluk felt would carve up their homeland, Uliny switched sides to fight with SPLO-IO in April 2015.&lt;ref name=foreignpolicy1/&gt; His forces were now known as the "Agwelek" army. On 16 May 2015, the Agwelek forces and elements of the SPLM-IO captured Upper Nile's capital, [[Malakal]], as well as Anakdiar and areas around [[Fashoda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/s-sudan-rebels-johnson-olony-our-side|title=S Sudan rebels: Johnson Olony is on our side|publisher=radiotamazuj.org|accessdate=2015-06-23|date=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group said they want to run their affairs independently from others in [[Upper Nile State]], and SPLM-IO backed away from claims that it is in charge of Olony's group and stated that Olony's interests simply coincides with theirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/machar-backs-away-claim-loyalty-independent-shilluk-forces|title=Machar backs away from claim to loyalty of 'independent' Shilluk forces|publisher=radiotamazuj.org|accessdate=2015-06-23|date=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPLM-IO said they understood the feeling from the [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]] community that they wanted a level of independence and that that was the reason the SPLM-IO last year created Fashoda state for the Shilluk kingdom and appointed Tijwog Aguet, a Shilluk, as governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article55014|title=Johnson Olony's forces prefer independent command in Upper Nile state|publisher=sudantribune.com|accessdate=2015-06-23|date=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the predominantly Shilluk Agwelek forces joined, in July 2016, with the SPLM-IO, which entered the peace agreement with the government, some Shilluk felt dissatisfied. After the establishment of the new states, a new group made up of mostly Shilluk formed the "Tiger Faction New Forces" (TFNF), led by General Yoanes Okij, alleging that the new states gives power over Shilluk lands to the Dinka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article56894|title=New rebel group formed in South Sudan against the creation of 28 states|publisher=Sudan Tribune|accessdate=15 December 2016|date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They rejected joining the SPLM-IO or the peace agreement and called for the restoration of the original 1956 borders of the Shilluk territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?iframe&amp;page=imprimable&amp;id_article=58273|title=Tiger faction of ethnic Shilluk kingdom dismisses integration into SPLM-IO|publisher=Sudan Tribune|accessdate=15 December 2016|date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, Shilluk politician [[Lam Akol]], leader of the largest opposition party, [[Democratic Change (South Sudan)|Democratic Change]], announced a new faction called the National Democratic Movement (NDM) to overthrow Kiir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/lam-akol-forms-rebel-movement-fight-south-sudan-government|title=Lam Akol forms rebel movement to fight South Sudan government|date=27 September 2016|publisher=Radio Tamazuj}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yohanis Okiech then joined the predominantly Shilluk NDM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article61355|title=S.Sudan rebel commander says rivalry undermines struggle|date=10 January 2017|publisher=Sudan Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; as deputy chief of general staff.

In the Upper Nile region, much of the [[South Sudanese Civil War#Renewed conflict and rebel infighting|fighting in 2016-17]] was between the SPLA and the SPLA-IO allied Upper Nile faction of Uliny. During this fighting, Shilluk in [[Wau Shilluk]] were forced from their homes and Yasmin Sooka, chairwoman of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, claimed that the government was engaging in "social engineering" after it transported 2,000 mostly Dinka people to the abandoned areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-15/un-warns-of-south-sudan-27social-engineering27/8354958|title=South Sudan: UN warns of 'social engineering' amid looming threat of genocide|publisher=ABC news|accessdate=17 March 2017|date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king of the [[Shilluk Kingdom]], Kwongo Dak Padiet, claimed his people were at risk of physical and cultural extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/south-sudan-experiencing-ethnic-cleansing-un-report-says/415571874/|title=South Sudan experiencing ethnic cleansing, UN report says|publisher=Star Tribune|accessdate=9 March 2017|date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed the SPLA razed down several villages and that his lawyers were preparing a case before the International Criminal Court against senior SPLA staff and members of the Jieng Council of Elders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/shilluk-king-accuses-government-ethnic-cleansing-upper-nile|title=South Sudan experiencing ethnic cleansing, UN report says|publisher=Star Tribune|accessdate=9 March 2017|date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[South Sudanese Civil War#Compromise Peace Agreement|Compromise Peace Agreement]], some observers felt that the government was holding on to the peace deal to maintain international aid while backing campaigns to increase Dinka control over land and resources traditionally held by other groups.

For most of the [[South Sudanese Civil War]], the fighting was focused in the [[Greater Upper Nile]] region.

'''Illuminares''' is an annual lantern festival held every summer in John Hendry Park (also known as [[Bodies of water in Vancouver#Trout Lake|Trout Lake]] Park) in east [[Vancouver]]. In 2010, the festival moved to [[Canada Place]], but the 2012 festival returned to John Hendry Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Werb|first=Jessica|title=Illuminares plans to return to nature|url=https://www.straight.com/article-419956/vancouver/illuminares-plans-return-nature|accessdate=20 May 2012|newspaper=The Georgia Straight|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Illuminares Lantern Festival set to return to Trout Lake|url=https://vancouversun.com/Illuminares+Lantern+Festival+return+Trout+Lake/6343325/story.html|accessdate=20 May 2012|newspaper=The Vancouver Sun|date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The event is put on by the [[Public Dreams Society]], a group formed in 1985 to encourage community events. ''Illuminares'' is a mixture of events put on by the society, such as fire-breathers and bands, and participants bringing their own homemade lanterns. Local artists run lantern making workshops to help people make their own personalized lantern. The festival is paid for through corporate and community sponsors, government grants as well as donations from participants at the event.

While it began as a small community festival, ''Illuminares'' has quickly grown into one of the most popular events in Vancouver. About 30,000 people come to this event each year. The number of people coming to this even grows exponentially every year. Illuminares happens on the last Saturday of July each year.

Public Dreams also participates in several other events in the Greater Vancouver area. These include the [[North Shore (Greater Vancouver)|North Shore]]'s Wild Lights Lantern Festival, held in [[Edgemont Village]], and the [[Parade of the Lost Souls]], a parade through Vancouver's [[Commercial Drive]] area around Halloween.

'''John "Jack" Livesey''' (born 15 May 1954) is a British [[military imposter]] who posed as a decorated war hero; in actuality he served in the army as a cook for three years. His fabricated military record included twenty years in the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]], fighting with the [[2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment|2nd Battalion]] in the [[Falklands War]], serving five tours of duty in [[Northern Ireland]], receiving the [[Military Medal]] and reaching the rank of [[Colour Sergeant]]. He has worked as a historian, author, consultant, lecturer and battlefield tour guide on the basis of his alleged military experience.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cambridgeshire/8130351.stm |title=Historian 'posed as a war hero'  |newspaper=BBC News |date=3 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Jack Livesey served as a chef in the [[Army Catering Corps]] from 1971 until 1974, when he was discharged following a mental breakdown. Livesey admitted that he created a 'fantasy world' to compensate for his early discharge from the army: 'I built this fictional guy up which was better than admitting the failure that was my military career […] It wasn’t the best way to end your military career. It was going to be my dream – the Army was a wonderful life and I screwed it up and created this fantasy'.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2021592/Benefits-cheat-John-Livesey-escaped-jail-thanks-fantasy-Falklands-heroics.html |title= Benefits cheat John Livesey escaped jail thanks to fantasy Falklands heroics is exposed as a liar  |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=3 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Livesey was featured as a military historian in the documentary ''Death and Destruction in the Falaise Gap''&lt;ref name="Death and Destruction in the Falaise Gap"&gt;{{cite video|title=Death and Destruction in the Falaise Gap|medium=DVD|publisher=DD Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|the History Channel]] series ''[[Battlefield Detectives]]''. He worked as a historical adviser on the 2005 [[BBC]] documentary series ''D-Day to Berlin'' and the 2006 movie ''[[Flyboys (film)|Flyboys]]''.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|2710612}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have also advised production crews, uncredited, on the miniseries ''[[Band of Brothers (miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'' and the movie ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC News2"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-14683750 |title= Army fantasist John Livesey jailed for lying to court  |newspaper=BBC News |date=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Livesey authored books of military non-fiction, three which were co-written by [[George Forty]], a well-known author and a former curator of [[the Tank Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/features/obituaries/14534276.Lt_Col_George_Forty_____Father_of_the_Tank_Museum___/|title=Lt Col George Forty, "Father of the Tank Museum"|work=bournemouthecho.co.uk|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Livesey worked at the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]] for seven years, first as a volunteer and later as a collections assistant, until he resigned in 2006.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;

== Criminal Convictions ==
In 2004 Jack Livesey was convicted of [[benefit fraud]] for receiving nearly £30,000 in [[incapacity benefit]] while he was employed at the Imperial War Museum. He was sentenced to a [[suspended sentence|suspended twelve-month jail term]] due to his supposed military service, and character references submitted by veterans including [[Air Commodore]] [[Peter Thorne (RAF officer)|Peter Thorne]] and Major [[Gordon Corrigan]], who knew Livesey and believed him to be a war hero.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt;

Livesey was exposed as an impostor when investigations following his conviction found that the references submitted by the veterans were based on false claims that Livesey had made to them. He was subsequently charged with [[perverting the course of justice]] by police, and admitted to lying about his army career, but denied he was aware the references were submitted. His partner, Bridget Pollard, testified that she had compiled the references.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/04/man-faked-army-career-guilty-perverting-justice |title= Man who faked army career guilty of perverting course of justice  |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mitigation, Livesey's attorney stated that his client had been diagnosed with [[dependent personality disorder|dependent]] and [[histrionic personality disorder]], and argued these disorders impaired his client's ability to tell fact from fiction. Livesey was found guilty, sentenced to three years in jail and was ordered to pay £3,500 in prosecution costs.&lt;ref name="Mirror"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/man-jailed-for-faking-army-career-185625 |title= Man jailed for faking army career  |newspaper=Mirror |date=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He filed on appeal on the grounds that his sentence was excessive. The appeal was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fake Falkland's war hero: sentence appeal dismissed|last=Brown|first=Raymond|publisher=''Cambridge News''|date=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''''Kagerou Project'''''|カゲロウプロジェクト|Kagerō Purojekuto|lit. "Heat Haze Project"}}, also known as {{Nihongo|"Kagerou Daze"|カゲロウデイズ|Kagerō Deizu|lit. "Heat Haze Daze"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4840149712|script-title=ja:カゲロウデイズ公式ビジュアルファンブック‐|trans-title=Kagerou Daze Official Visual Fanbook|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=December 5, 2013|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Kagerou Days", is a Japanese mixed-media project. It started as a [[Vocaloid]] song series created by {{nihongo|Jin (Shizen no Teki-P)|じん(自然の敵P)||}}. The story revolves around the Mekakushi Dan, a group of young people with unusual eye-related powers.

The series became popular on the video sharing website [[Niconico]] after the release of the music video and song for "Kagerou Daze", which primarily featured character Hibiya Amamiya (supporting character Hiyori Asahina referred to only in the song's lyrics), also gave the series its name. The song has amassed over 3 million views and is the most popular song of the project. Seven light novels have been released, written by Jin and illustrated by {{nihongo|Sidu|しづ|Shizu}}. A manga adaptation with illustrations by {{nihongo|Mahiro Satou|佐藤まひろ|Satō Mahiro|}}, began serialization in ''[[Monthly Comic Gene]]'' on June 15, 2012, also written by Jin. A 12-episode anime adaptation titled {{nihongo|'''''Mekakucity Actors'''''|メカクシティアクターズ|Mekakushiti Akutāzu|lit. "Blindfold-city Actors"}}—"Mekakucity" being a [[portmanteau]] of "mekakushi" ("blindfold" in Japanese) and "city"—aired between April 12 and June 28, 2014. The series was directed by [[Akiyuki Shinbo]] and animated by [[Shaft (company)|Shaft]], with the script also written completely by Jin.

==Plot==
In the novels and anime, Shintarō Kisaragi of "Kashiwa City", Japan is an 18-year-old [[hikikomori|hiki]]-[[NEET]] who has not left his room in two years, engrossing himself with his computer and the internet. However, on August 14, due to the messing about of the cyber girl Ene, who lives inside his computer, Shintarō spills soda on his computer keyboard and is forced to go outside to buy a new one, due to the fact that during the Obon festival none of the stores will deliver until August 17. (In the manga's second alternate storyline, he goes to buy food for his female pet rabbit; Tono.) Shintarō goes to the department store, where a group of criminals break in and hold the people inside hostage for ransom. Here he comes in contact with a group of people calling themselves the {{nihongo|"Mekakushi Dan"|メカクシ団||lit. "Blindfold Gang"}}, who stop the robbery with their mysterious eye powers and "force" Shintarō to join into their group.

Before this occurs, in the novel and anime, Shintarō's younger sister, Momo Kisaragi, is a popular idol and first-year high school student who has the ability to attract people's attention. This is due to the "Drawing Eyes" ability, which she cannot control and causes people to look at her wherever she goes. One day, while fleeing from a horde of fans, she meets the Mekakushi Dan leader, Tsubomi Kido, who invites Momo to join, which she does. In the manga adaptation, however, events take different turns.

In the novels and anime, while meeting the first four members of the Mekakushi Dan, Marry trips and gets Momo's phone wet, and the Mekakushi Dan all go to the department store to buy a new phone for Momo. Kido uses her ability to keep people from staring at Momo, but while in the store, they find out Shintarō is there at the same time. The terrorists break in and take all the shoppers hostage, but with Kido's eye power, she, Momo, Marry, Seto, and Kano are invisible and thus do not get caught. They work together to stop the heist, though Shintarō passes out, and they bring him to their hideout and introduce him and Ene as members once the former awakens. Afterwards, they all go to the amusement park to have fun. However, further events begin to unfold.

The prologue for the novels' storyline is told in the second novel, ''-a headphone actor-''. Takane Enomoto and Haruka Kokonose, students of Kenjirō Tateyama, plan a class booth for their school's cultural festival. Haruka gets an idea to host a shooting booth; however this idea could not be fulfilled due to Kenjirō spending all their booth funds on a rare specimen. Takane, being a highly skilled gamer, decides that instead of a shooting booth with a large amount of equipment, they should make a video game of a first-person shooter. Kenjirō would be in charge of programming, Haruka was in charge of illustration and Takane was responsible for playing as the opponent. Their plan captured a great amount of attention, good and bad.

The series contains alternative storylines, endings (and in some cases, beginnings) depending on the format of the media, called "routes".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Kagerou Project Perfect Guide" (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Music Route, occurring between the years 2011-2013 initially and otherwise beyond, is the original first "route". It comes first in the official "timelines" order. It contains all of the official music videos for the "Kagerou Project" songs, with music by Jin, and animations by Wannyanpū and Sidu (later only Sidu).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many notable songs, however, are left out of the initial, chronological "music route" described, though they are stated to still be included in the overall route. "Lost Time Memory" in Music Route splits into "Route XX", "Route 1", and "Route 2", with "XX" being a "bad ending", "1" leading to the main storyline, and "2" implied a "good ending".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* Manga Route, published between the years 2012 (June) and currently, comes second in the official "timelines" order. Though it debuted in June 2012, Jin confirmed he was working on the manga earlier on, writing the story for it as of "Konoha's World Situation"'s music video release in May 2012. The manga would later split into two alternate timelines, the second following drastically different events from the first.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* Novels Route, published between the years 2012 (May) through 2017 (2018 for the US release), comes after Manga Route and seemingly before the Mekakucity Actors anime in the official "timelines" order.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* Mekakucity Actors Route, the initially airing anime which aired beginning of April 2014 through June 2014, was not included in the official timelines of the "Kagerou Project Perfect Guide" (2016); however, the anime itself signifies more initially conclusive events. The lack of inclusion in the official timelines, despite its existence at the time, seems to indicate it comes after them as well.
* Kagerou Daze -in a day's- (カゲロウデイズ-in a day's-) is an MX4D produced animated short movie in which the Mekakushi Dan join together to once again stop an incident occurring at the mall. This Mekakushi Dan consists of Dan members 1-7 initially, and also containing Ene, Hibiya Amamiya, Konoha, and Hiyori Asahina. This is despite many notable events of the previous "routes". Certain other members related to the Dan do not appear in this "route", while instead "new" characters do; however, the "new" characters' identities were kept somewhat secret, including their names. An initial promotion for the film described it as a "Route-2", though the events contained seem wholly different to the "Route-2" that occurs in "Lost Time Memory"'s music video. The "new" characters were created specifically for this film.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Various other (including smaller or shorter) "timelines" are also contained within major "routes" or other side materials. These are all indicated in detail in the "Kagerou Project Perfect Guide" (2016).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; While many "timelines" occur between the dates of August 14–15 (and in some cases a short time beyond, such as August 17, among other dates) some "timelines"'s initial storylines are indicated to happen before the "main" series begins. This often involves the backstories of the "trio" of Kido, Kano, and Seto and their encounters, on their own or otherwise, and notably involving supporting characters Ayano Tateyama, and Mekakushi Dan member Marry Kozakura (notably detailing her meeting with character Seto). Yet more timelines occur detailing Marry's own backstory, and events that happen long before that; also indicated by which timeline, or "August 15th" (among similar close dates) is referred to.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Characters==
===Mekakushi Dan===
;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Kido}}|キド|Kido}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Tsubomi Kido}}|木戸 つぼみ|Kido Tsubomi}}
:{{voiced by|[[Yūko Kaida]]}}
:Kido is member No. 1 of the Mekakushi Dan and its current leader. She is often mistaken as a male due to her ambiguous appearance. The other members of the Dan call her "Danchō" (lit. gang leader). Like Kano and Seto, she is addressed by her legal last name (which she retains) even by her closest friends. Her personal song is {{Nihongo|"Never Lost Word"|失想ワアド|Shissō Wādo}}, though she initially debuted in {{Nihongo|"Blindfold Chord"|メカクシコード| Mekakushi Chord}}.&lt;ref name="Mekakushi Dan Official Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:She was born as the first daughter of a wealthy family, but due to being the illegitimate child between her biological father and his mistress, her biological mother, she always felt out of place, even at home. Because she was always treated cautiously by those around her, she harbored a strong desire to "disappear". One day, her father's business went bankrupt, driving him to set their house on fire. After being burned to death in the blaze, Kido came into contact with the Heat Haze along with her older half sister Rin ({{voiced by|[[Yuki Kaida]]}}) and was possessed by the snake with the "Concealing Eyes" ability, thus acquiring the power to hide her presence, as well as the presence of anyone else within a two meter radius. She would then proceed to forget this event (of the Heat Haze) completely, until she has to remember it later on in the seventh novel, "From the Darkness" (partially told from her point of view, with her as the "lead" of the story). Becoming childhood friends with Seto and Kano in the same orphanage, she was later fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; temporarily by the Tateyama family, until events forced them out of the Tateyamas' home, including a "route" where they cut off all ties with Ayano. Initially encouraged by Ayano that having red eyes was the sign of a hero, she and the "trio" (her, Seto, and Kano) started the Mekakushi Dan. After Ayano's death, she was then given the role of "leader".

:In the manga's alternate second timeline, Kido is the first to be killed after stumbling upon the Snake of Clearing Eyes. Kano then reflects on her death after she is found, and while later reconciling with Ayano, who did not get to reconcile with Kido in turn before Kido died. The manga also reveals the event of Kano first meeting Kido at the orphanage, told during the different alternative second timeline (also different from the novels version). Kido gives Kano her coat, as she noticed he was cold, Kano reacting with a surprised expression. The timeline would then go on to explain the two became fast childhood friends before meeting Seto later on, becoming a childhood friend of Seto's as well; the three being described officially, in relationship charts published in the official website as well as "Kagerou Project Perfect Guide" (2016),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; as seeing each other as "childhood friends".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

: Though Kido (in the novels) initially requests they do not use [[keigo]] (Japanese formalities), as it reminds her of her biological family, and because she dislikes such formalities now; Kano in the manga's alternate second timeline thought he ''was'' originally going to use [[keigo]] with her before she requested that. Initially dropping the formalities and beginning to call her by her first name alone, "Tsubomi", while with the Tateyamas and while during middle school two years before the main series begins (including while attending the school festival put on by Haruka and Takane), Kano would later come to address her by her last name ("Kido") after they leave the Tateyama household (an event which occurs in every "route" described in the "Kagerou Project Perfect Guide" (2016).),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; the other two of the trio doing the same for him in every "route".

:Though Kido was initially described (in Mekakucity Actors' script) with an "official" age of "17", and Kano and Seto "16", this would not be chronologically possible as the "trio" of Kido, Kano, and Seto are all in the same school grade, with varying birthdays (January 2, May 10, and March 3rd respectively). As a typical Japanese school year begins in April and ends in March (the series taking place in "Kashiwa City", Japan, later noted to also be in the Chiba prefecture) the ages conflicted with the official timelines, many taking place on August 14th-August 15th and later (in some cases) 17th. Sidu's published official artbook would later re-confirm Kido's age being "16", as Kano's is also officially changed correctly to "17", him (May 10) being older than Kido (January 2). Seto (birthday March 3rd) is the youngest of the trio, though still in the same grade as them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Seto}}|セト|Seto}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Kōsuke Seto}}|瀬戸 幸助|Seto Kōsuke}}
:{{voiced by|[[Sōichirō Hoshi]]}}, [[Sayori Ishizuka]] (young)
:Seto is member No. 2 of the Mekakushi Dan. He is often portrayed as the "nice" one of the group, and gets along very well with Marry. Like Kano and Kido, he is addressed by his legal last name (which he retains) even by his closest friends. His song is {{Nihongo|"Shōnen Brave"|少年ブレイブ||"Brave Boy"}}.

:As a young boy, his small body and timid nature resulted in him being often bullied, and he had trouble speaking with people. He considered an abandoned dog (named "Hanako") to be his only friend, and wished that he could "understand how people felt without using words". One stormy day, he witnessed some kids trying to throw his dog friend into a river. Despite his efforts, the dog was thrown in, and Seto threw himself into the river in order to save it. As he drowned, he came into contact with the Heat Haze and was possessed by the snake with the "Stealing Eyes" ability, acquiring the ability to read others' minds upon eye contact. However, he generally dislikes using his eye ability as he feels that it is invasive and makes communication redundant, so he avoids using it unless it is absolutely necessary. He eventually was fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; temporarily by the Tateyama family along with Kido and Kano. Together they created the Mekakushi Dan after being initially encouraged by Ayano.&lt;ref name="Mekakushi Dan Official Website"/&gt;

:In "Imagination Forest" (as "{{Nihongo|"Sōzō Foresuto"|空想フォレスト||"Imagination Forest"}}")'s original music video for the "music route", where he first debuted, he comes into contact with Marry as his "younger" looking design, animated initially here for the first time by (わんにゃんぷー Wannyanpū). His expression is partly hidden the entire time, as his full redesign to look "older" hadn't yet been made by animator Sidu (this would not occur until later on, with the official website's reveal). In {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}}, Seto appears with his eyes and expressions visible, now fully redesigned, with his "older" self appearing towards the end as well. Both music videos have slight differences between the two in their animation styles and noticeable changes in their endings, though {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}} debuted later on. The music video for Seto's song, {{Nihongo|"Shōnen Brave"|少年ブレイブ||"Brave Boy"}}, shows the younger Seto alternating and standing side by side with the older Seto in some scenes, implying the two are aware something is happening, as they hold hands at the end. The younger Seto in {{Nihongo|"Shōnen Brave"|少年ブレイブ||"Brave Boy"}} once again meets Marry in a similar fashion to both {{Nihongo|"Sōzō Foresuto"|空想フォレスト||"Imagination Forest"}} and {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}}. In both music videos, he appears to play music for her to hear, using his phone (though initially looking similar to a music player in {{Nihongo|"Sōzō Foresuto"|空想フォレスト||"Imagination Forest"}}).&lt;ref name="Mekakushi Dan Official Website"/&gt;

:In the manga's alternate first timeline, {{Nihongo|"Sōzō Foresuto"|空想フォレスト||"Imagination Forest"}} is referred to as an initial chapter title for the Japanese edition, before changing abruptly to {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}} in the manga's alternate second timeline. This change possibly references the music videos, as the entire course of the typical plot changes in the manga route's second timeline, when Marry hears loud text message notifications on Seto's phone instead of music playing, becoming frightened by the sound. The text message notifications are coming from a worried younger Kano, Kido, and Ayano, as Seto was already with the Tateyamas in this "route". (In both {{Nihongo|"Sōzō Foresuto"|空想フォレスト||"Imagination Forest"}} and {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}}'s music videos, Ayano's connection to the trio hadn't been revealed yet, as it wouldn't be revealed until the later "Ayano's Theory of Happiness" music video.) The author, Jin, had also commented in 2012 in the official "Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book" that Ayano as a character was still being finalized around that time. (Both {{Nihongo|"Sōzō Foresuto"|空想フォレスト||"Imagination Forest"}} and {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}}'s music videos, meanwhile, had debuted by May 18, 2012, when {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}} debuted.) Kano as a character also was not revealed nor finalized until the first novel was released and the official website opened in 2012. Thus, in both {{Nihongo|"Sōzō Foresuto"|空想フォレスト||"Imagination Forest"}} and {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}}, only Kido is seen at the end with Seto, and not Kano, who wouldn't appear until the later music video for {{Nihongo|"Kisaragi Attention"|如月アテンション}}.&lt;ref name="Mekakushi Dan Official Website"/&gt;

:In the official spinoff series "Mekakucity Talkers", the "Trio" of Kido, Kano and Seto appears to now live at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout while both Ayano and Kenjirou are still alive and living at the Tateyama's household (Ayaka Tateyama, however, does not initially appear, and timeline differences seemingly occur in Talkers as well). Initially, including in earlier Talkers chapters, the Trio and the Tateyamas still appeared to function as a foster unit, such as when they talk about celebrating Kenjirou's birthday (Ayano, here seemingly alive, also appears at the household). However, later on in Talkers Chapter 29, a conversation occurs between Marry, Seto, Kano, and Shintarō as they discuss "siblings". Marry claims she wants a "brother" (or, specifically, an "''[[Japanese honorifics|onii-chan]]''"-like figure), and targets the boys present in her "search" for an "''onii-chan''". Previously during the same chat, Shintarō asks Kano if the Trio were "kind of" like siblings, to which Kano replies saying he doesn't believe he (Kano) has much "''onii-chan'' power" ("big brother power"), eventually implying Shintarō has more of that than he does. Seto would later join in the conversation, agreeing with Kano as well (while also stating Shintarō has the "longest history as an ''Onii-chan''"). The two frequently try to escape becoming Marry's "''onii-chan''", despite the earlier published alternative second manga storyline, and at one point Seto implies Marry calling him "Seto-onii-chan" feels weird ("''Uh, that way of referring to me gives me a weird feeling... I wish you would drop it...''") Eventually, the boys resolve the issue with Marry by them all agreeing they can be "friends" instead of siblings. Marry would later respond stating, "I don't need an ''Onii-chan''. I [want to] go have fun with a friend."

:Though Kido was initially described (in Mekakucity Actors' script) with an "official" age of "17", and Kano and Seto "16", this would not be chronologically possible as the "trio" of Kido, Kano, and Seto are all in the same school grade, with varying birthdays (January 2, May 10, and March 3rd respectively). As a typical Japanese school year begins in April and ends in March (the series taking place in "Kashiwa City", Japan, later noted to also be in the Chiba prefecture) the ages conflicted with the official timelines, many taking place on August 14th-August 15th and later (in some cases) 17th. Sidu's published official artbook would later re-confirm Kido's age being "16", as Kano's is also officially changed correctly to "17", him (May 10) being older than Kido (January 2). Seto (birthday March 3rd) is the youngest of the trio, though still in the same grade as them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:{{voiced by|[[Shinnosuke Tachibana]]}}, [[Yuki Kaida]] (young)
:Kano is member No. 3 of the Mekakushi Dan. He is depicted as a deceitful young man, to the point where no one can tell if he's lying or telling the truth. His song is {{Nihongo|"Yobanashi Deceive"|夜咄ディセイブ||"Night Tales Deceive"}}.

:When Kano was younger, he did not attend preschool or kindergarten and instead lived alone with his mother in an apartment. His emotionally unstable mother raised her hand against him from time to time, and the neighbors spread rumors that he was being abused by her. In the novels "route", he believed that he was wrong for upsetting her, and desired strongly to "hide the bruises/wounds on his body" from those around him because they were the reason the neighbors disliked his mother. One day (in the novels "route"), his apartment was broken into by thieves. Kano's mother was stabbed and killed as she tried to protect him. He was stabbed to death as well when he tried to fight against the thieves, coming into contact with the Heat Haze. He was then possessed by the snake with the "Deceiving Eyes" ability, acquiring the power to alter how people around him perceive him and anything in immediate contact with him.

:He was eventually brought to an orphanage and was later fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; temporarily by the Tateyama family, where he met Kido, Seto. While being fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; temporarily by the Tateyama family, they meet a younger Ayano (Kano having already met her previously as a stranger in the novels "route"). They created a team of "heroes" and Kano gave it its name, the Mekakushi Dan—"Mekakushi" being a pun on Kido's eye ability. Unlike Seto, Kano uses his eye ability frequently, shifting outward emotions on a whim while never showing what he is truly feeling on the inside. He and Ayano were very close, as evidenced by the fact that (in the novels and anime "routes") she only shared her suspicions about Kenjirō with him. As a result (in the novels "route") he often impersonated her and went to school in her stead, while she researched a way to stop the plans of Clearing Eyes. Ayano's death affects him greatly, and the added trauma of (in the novels "route") having to pretend to be Ayano's corpse during the funeral (as she did not leave behind a body) leaves him emotionally distressed. Though he uses his power to maintain a mask of lightheartedness and mischief, he develops a tendency to lash out at people close to him, sometimes by imitating people they care about, such as when he impersonated Haruka to upset Ene, or when impersonating Ayano to upset Shintarō.

:In the music video for {{Nihongo|"Yobanashi Deceive"|夜咄ディセイブ||"Night Tales Deceive"}} in "music" route, Kano continuously walks the streets at night. He briefly is seen wearing hair clips while grinning, while images of a younger Seto and younger Kido are also seen behind him (Ayano is also noted to wear such hair clips; Seto being shown wearing them too in the video). Kano is later seen with a "female" form, shown more than once (including together) in both the official music video as well as published artbooks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He is always "Deceiving", initially believing himself to be something like a "monster". When a "monster" (implied to be Clearing Eyes in the novels) speaks to him one day, Kano begins to descend into always telling "lies", unable to tell his true self from his "Deceiving" self. He is frequently seen around and holding (including up to his face) masks, indicating his "Deceiving". At the end of the video, he bows to the viewer, as if it was a performance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:In the manga's alternate second timeline, his relationship with Ayano is more strained due to him being angry at her for suggesting to kill Marry. Kido's death greatly angers him to the point he wants to fight against her killer, the Snake Of Clearing Eyes.

:In the official spinoff series "Mekakucity Talkers", the "Trio" of Kido, Kano and Seto appears to now live at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout while both Ayano and Kenjirou are still alive and living at the Tateyama's household (Ayaka Tateyama, however, does not initially appear, and timeline differences seemingly occur in Talkers as well). Initially, including in earlier Talkers chapters, the Trio and the Tateyamas still appeared to function as a foster unit, such as when they talk about celebrating Kenjirou's birthday (Ayano, here seemingly alive, also appears at the household). However, later on in Talkers Chapter 29, a conversation occurs between Marry, Seto, Kano, and Shintarō as they discuss "siblings".

:Marry is member No. 4 of the Mekakushi Dan, and the first non-founding member. She is 1/4 [[Medusa]] and has white hair that wiggles when she is happy or frightened and naturally occurring red eyes. Her appearance is that of a teenage girl, but due to her Medusa blood, her actual age is 140 years. Marry is extremely shy around strangers, and will often hide behind Seto, Kido, or Momo. Her songs are {{Nihongo|"Kūsō Forest"|空想フォレスト||"Fantasy Forest"}} and {{Nihongo|"Marry no Kakū Sekai"|マリーの架空世界||"Marry's Fictional World"}}.

:When Marry was younger, she lived in a small house in the woods with her mother, Shion, who was half Medusa. While growing up, she was constantly warned by her mother that should they make eye contact with others, the person would be turned to stone. One day, when she was playing outside against her mother's warnings, she was found and tortured by a group of boys. Shion successfully turned Marry's attackers to stone, but the two were both beaten to death, and were brought into the Heat Haze by Azami, Shion's full Medusa mother (and Marry's grandmother). Upon entering it, Azami planted the snake with the "Combining Eyes" ability, the core of the Medusa, into Shion, who willingly gave it up to Marry so that she could have a second chance at life. As a result, along with the "Eye Contact" ability she had since birth, which allowed Marry to temporarily paralyze anyone she made eye contact with, Marry also acquired the ability to unify all of the "snakes".

:After coming back to life, she lived in isolation for over a hundred years, greatly traumatized by her mother's death and terrified by the outside world. By chance, Seto visited the forest and befriended her, making her realize that the outside isn't so scary after all. He has since managed to bring her to the outside world and invited her to join the Mekakushi Dan.

:After coming to the Mekakushi Dan's hideout and joining the group, she started a side job making fake flowers in her room, which generates a negligible income. She is said to be a ''fujoshi'', or a female who likes [[Yaoi|boy's love]].&lt;ref name="Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012"&gt;Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In Route XX among other "bad end" timelines, Clearing Eyes then kills all the members of the Mekakushi Dan besides Marry, and has her reset the timeline. This happens by means of her Combining Eyes ability, used through her by the snake of 'Clearing Eyes', who "awakens" her&lt;ref name="Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012"/&gt;(often in "Queen" form), and, by "collecting" the snakes that "have lost their owners",&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; she reverses time in order to save everyone. Marry seemingly reverses time at the end of every official "route" and "timeline" seen thus far.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:In the manga's alternate second timeline only, she was found by Seto years before than in the other timelines and was fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; temporarily by the Tateyama family. When Ayaka and Kenjirō both died, Marry became completely guilt ridden, believing that her being a "monster" caused the whole tragedy to happen. She also believes she herself is why the relationships between every member of the "trio" (including herself, and Ayano) had been "changing", stating this belief to Seto. Seto encourages her, explaining it's natural for human beings to "change", and implying it's not her fault. This event occurs after a scene in which Marry asks Kano, "do you [[Love|like]] Kido?", comparing Kano's feelings towards Kido and seeing them similar to those relationships seen in her fairy tale books (and claiming she read about it in a book). The specific word she uses in the Japanese edition is "''suki''", often used in romantic situations in Japan and between couples. Though Kano blushes and nervously denies such, Marry continued to press the question until Kano "ran away" to escape. The implication that the trio, Marry, and Ayano were all "changing" indicates that their former relationships had all thus "changed", in some cases drastically (such as their initially kicking Ayano out of the household) and in some cases not (such as Seto viewing Marry as a friend and human being, and the trio and Marry all viewing each other as "friends".).

:It's also revealed in the same alternate second timeline of the manga that Marry's "Queen" (of the snakes) power here causes a great toll on her body as it slowly deteriorates her body to the point she can't move at all, possibly a result of her being more human than Medusa. Despite her cheerful personality, a monologue in the manga implies that while she loves her friends, she harbors a grudge against the world for taking everything from her, reflecting some of the attitudes her grandmother Azami and her mother Shion held towards humanity. She begins to absorb the powers of the snakes of her fallen comrades. The Mekakushi Dan members left, including her, would then attempt to face off against the snake of Clearing Eyes.

:In the official spinoff series "Mekakucity Talkers", the "Trio" of Kido, Kano and Seto appears to now live at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout while both Ayano and Kenjirou are still alive and living at the Tateyama's household (Ayaka Tateyama, however, does not initially appear, and timeline differences seemingly occur in Talkers as well). Initially, including in earlier Talkers chapters, the Trio and the Tateyamas still appeared to function as a foster unit, such as when they talk about celebrating Kenjirou's birthday (Ayano, here seemingly alive, also appears at the household). However, later on in Talkers Chapter 29, a conversation occurs between Marry, Seto, Kano, and Shintarō as they discuss "siblings". Marry claims she wants a "brother" (or, specifically, an "''[[Japanese honorifics|onii-chan]]''"-like figure), and targets the boys present in her "search" for an "''onii-chan''". Previously during the same chat, Shintarō asks Kano if the Trio were "kind of" like siblings, to which Kano replies saying he doesn't believe he (Kano) has much "''onii-chan'' power" ("big brother power"), eventually implying Shintarō has more of that than he does. Seto would later join in the conversation, agreeing with Kano as well (while also stating Shintarō has the "longest history as an ''Onii-chan''"). The two frequently try to escape becoming Marry's "''onii-chan''", despite the earlier published alternative second manga storyline, and at one point Seto implies Marry calling him "Seto-onii-chan" feels weird ("''Uh, that way of referring to me gives me a weird feeling... I wish you would drop it...''") Eventually, the boys resolve the issue with Marry by them all agreeing they can be "friends" instead of siblings. Marry would later respond stating, "I don't need an ''Onii-chan''. I [want to] go have fun with a friend."

:Though she is referred to as a "[[Gorgon|gorgon]]" in the English localizations of the series, the Japanese translation as well as Jin himself have also referred to her instead being "[[Medusa]]". As well, her name is also frequently romanized as "Mary" and "Marie" in official Japanese materials, such as merchandise. All romanizations, including "Marry" (used in the English localization) are technically correct.

:Marry's "age" Jin would later clarify himself on his official Twitter, stating: "Since she didn't really count it, she herself didn't know her own age. So, on Marry's first birthday at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout, Kano told her that "You'll be the same age as everyone then!!!" while lighting 17 candles on the cake." "The same age as everyone" would refer to the "Trio" of Kano, Kido, and Seto all being around the same age (Kano 17, Kido and Seto 16 "going-on" 17). This exchange would imply Marry's "age" to be seen by her as being "17" as of July 21 (her official birthday). She also celebrates a birthday during the official spinoff series "Mekakucity Talkers", while already living at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout.

;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Momo}}|モモ|Momo}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Momo Kisaragi}}|如月 桃|Kisaragi Momo}}
:{{voiced by|Nanami Kashiyama}}
:Momo is member No. 5 of the Mekakushi Dan. She is a first-year high school student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mekakucityactors.com/character/005momo.html|title=Character {{!}} 「メカクシティアクターズ」公式サイト|publisher=1st Place|accessdate=September 29, 2018|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the younger sister of Shintarō and a popular [[aidoru|idol]], which greatly disrupts her normal life and causes a lot of stress for her. Unlike her brother, she does badly at school, and is a clumsy yet cheerful girl. Momo's tastes are also shown to be rather strange. Her songs are {{Nihongo|"Kisaragi Attention"|如月アテンション}}, {{Nihongo|"Otsukimi Recital"|オツキミリサイタル||"Moon Viewing Recital"}} (''with Hibiya Amamiya''), and {{Nihongo|"Tomodachi no Uta"|友達の唄|Song of Friends/A Song of My Friend}}.

:When Momo was younger, she was constantly overshadowed by her brother Shintarō causing her to yearn for attention. During a trip to the beach, she drowned in the ocean and was swallowed up by the Heat Haze, along with her father who had tried to save her, and given the snake of "Drawing Eyes", which is capable of catching people's attention regardless of their preferences. At a fairly young age as a Junior High schooler, she gets a job as an idol, but she finds the constant attention and pressure miserable, lamenting that she just wants to be normal. It's here that she meets Kido, who explains the nature of their powers and offers to use teach Momo how to control her Drawing Eyes if she joins the Mekakushi Dan. Momo accepts, to Shintarō's eventual chagrin.

:In the manga's alternate timeline, she becomes the second victim of the Snake Of Clearing Eyes' killing spree, when she is thrown off a tall building by "Hibiya Amamiya" (as taken over by Clearing Eyes). Clearing Eyes (as "Hibiya") gets Momo to follow him when he asks for Momo's (referring to her as "[[Japanese honorifics|onee-chan]]") "help". ("Please help me, ''onee-chan''.") However, it's implied Momo knew something was wrong right away, as she reacts with a firm-looking expression and follows him; and likely recognizing he wasn't using "oba-san" or "Aun" (his "ruder" nicknames and "honorific") for her. This was incorrectly translated in the official English version of the manga; even though in the Japanese version and editions, the different honorifics are clearly displayed (including as [[Kanji|kanji]]). Similar to this, in the novels, another instance occurs: Shintarō recognizes right away Kano is posing as Momo when "Momo" (Kano) doesn't use the Japanese honorific "''onii-chan''" (lit. "big brother") for Shintarō. ("Momo calls me 'onii-chan', ''Kano''.")

:Though the script for Mekakucity Actors introduced her as being "16" years of age, as she is a 1st year high school student&lt;ref name="http://mekakushidan.com/actors/momo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/momo|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=October 4th, 2018|accessdate=October 4th, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Japan (the series takes place in "Kashiwa City", and somewhere near [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba Prefecture]]), she can chronologically only be "15" at the current point of the series (August 14th-17th), as she would not have her 16th birthday until the next years' February 14th. The [[Japanese Education|Japanese school year]] begins in April and ends in March; thus, she could only be 15 at the start of the school year with a birthday of February 14th. This inconsistency was acknowledged by the anime staff at an event for fans in Japan, and Momo's canonical grade of "1st year high school student" (10th grade) is stated on the official website.&lt;ref name="http://mekakushidan.com/actors/momo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/momo|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=October 4th, 2018|accessdate=October 4th, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would later be shown as also the correct grade for her "age" range in both the manga's second alternate timeline and the sixth novel ("Over the Dimension"), showing her as a Junior High (equivalent to "middle school") schooler 2 years before the main series begins, when she'd be around 13-going-on-14 years of age and in the 8th grade.
;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Ene}}|エネ|Ene}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Takane Enomoto}}|榎本 貴音|Enomoto Takane}}
:{{voiced by|[[Kana Asumi]]}}
:Ene is member No. 6 of Mekakushi Dan. She is a mischievous cyber girl who lives in Shintarō's computer, but is also able to travel to other electronic devices. Once a human named {{Nihongo|Takane Enomoto|榎本 貴音|Enomoto Takane}}, her personality as Ene is a cheerful prankster, a sharp contrast to Takane's pessimistic outlook at life. Her songs are {{Nihongo|"Jinzō Enemy"|人造エネミー||"Artificial Enemy"}}, {{Nihongo|"Headphone Actor"|ヘッドフォンアクター}}, {{Nihongo|"Ene no Dennō Kikō"|エネの電脳紀行||"Ene's Cyber Journey"}} and {{Nihongo|"Yūkei Yesterday"|夕景イエスタデイ||"Yesterday Evening"}}.

:As a human, she suffered from an illness that causes her to lose consciousness at random times. Because of this, she was placed in a separate class at school with Haruka Kokonose, whom she harbored feelings for. As a human, Takane was ranked second in the country on a game called 'Dead Bullet -1989-' under the name of "Senkou no Maihime" (lit. Dancing Princess of the Spotlight)' and often stayed up late at night playing. This exacerbated her narcolepsy and made her irritable and bad-tempered at school. She died after being poisoned by Kenjirō. Upon entering the Heat Haze, she is given the snake of "Opening Eyes," giving her immortality through the ability to reside in digital objects. After becoming Ene, she was sent to Shintarō's computer in an email from an unknown sender. Shintarō refers to her as a 'virus' as she constantly plays pranks on him by deleting his files and threatening to upload his embarrassing poems on to the internet. Ene joins the Mekakushi Dan after helping to stop a terrorist attack at a local department store with Shintarō.

:In the manga's alternate timeline, she meets Haruka while both are hospitalized, and quickly bonds with him over video games. While she leaves, Haruka remains in the hospital, though she continues to talk to him. Upon seeing his fast friendship with Shintarō, she stops talking to him out of jealousy. Later, she discovers that he had an attack and passed away, and that shortly beforehand he had sketched her in his notebook. It is strongly implied that her regret caused her to commit suicide by jumping off the hospital building, at which point she entered the Heat Haze and became Ene.

:Ene is not given an official age nor a birthday, her "age" being listed in Jin's 2012 "Disintegration Book" as being "''???''". However, Takane was in the same grade as Haruka, who were both a grade above Shintarō and Ayano during high school (when Takane, Haruka, and Ayano were alive, 2 years before the main series begins). Despite rumors of such, Takane was also not given an official age nor birthday in any official canonical source.

;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Shintarō}}|シンタロー|Shintarō}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Shintarō Kisaragi}}|如月 伸太郎|Kisaragi Shintarō}}
:{{voiced by|[[Takuma Terashima]]}}
:Shintarō is member No. 7 of Mekakushi Dan. He is the main protagonist of the story and has an IQ of 168. While he was in school, his intelligence caused him to have an apathetic personality. His songs are {{Nihongo|"Lost Time Memory"|ロスタイムメモリー}} and {{Nihongo|"Tōmei Answer"|透明アンサー||"Transparent Answer"}}.

:After a while, he became interested in the girl who sat next to him in class, Ayano Tateyama. Despite Ayano always acting cheerful and friendly towards him, Shintarō would treat Ayano with something like coldness - though he is also shown to begin to regard Ayano at all, if not fully as a "friend". Ayano appears happy whenever Shintaro regards her. After Ayano's suicide, he falls into a deep depression and becomes a [[hikikomori]] addicted to the internet. A year after, he was "sent" a mysterious "virus" named Ene, and as he was unable to control her actions, his lifestyle was at a loss. After stopping a terrorist attack with Ene, he became involved with Mekakushi Dan. He would later come to possess the "Retaining Eyes", which allow him to remember all of the past (including all other previous routes and otherwise diverging timelines).

:In the songs ("Music Route") Ayano's death results in two possible routes for the Mekakushi Dan, as shown in Lost Time Memory. In Route 1, also known as the Good End Route, Shintarō (often portrayed in a red jersey) goes out and meets the Mekakushi Dan instead of staying at home and mourning Ayano. In Route XX, also known as the Bad End, Shintarō (often portrayed in full black clothing), still mourning over Ayano's death at 18 years old, becomes fed up with Ene and kills her through unknown means, causing him to have a mental breakdown. The main Shintarō dies while saving "Kuroha" (or, Clearing Eyes possessed Konoha) from shooting himself, while Route XX Shintarō commits suicide by slitting his throat with a pair of red scissors. However, all of these events would supposedly lead to Shintarō coming to possess "Retaining Eyes".

:In the manga's alternate first and second timelines, Shintarō is shown to have never met Ayano at all. However, after he dies in the first timeline, a "vision" (or "dream") of "Ayano" appears before him, asking him if Shintarō knew why she died. After injuring himself in the new timeline he is hospitalized beside Haruka Kokonose, who serves the role of causing him to come out of his shell instead (and instead of Shintarō meeting Haruka at school and becoming his, Ayano's, and Takane's classmate). When Haruka's illness causes him to have an attack and pass away, Shintarō breaks down at the loss of his only friend and becomes a hikikomori like in the other timelines. It is later revealed Takane watched some of this happen from mostly afar (while going mostly unnoticed by Shintarō and Haruka, when she tries to visit Haruka's hospital room to see Haruka). Takane would later seemingly commit suicide; becoming Ene, who again enters Shintarō's life, and decides to help him come out of his shell herself this time. Shintarō thus befriends Ene in a much different fashion from before, genuinely viewing her as a friend as time goes on. Together with Ene, Shintarō and her would also play with the younger Junior High school aged Momo (Ene was even who seemed to pick out Momo's "Aun" hoodie). Shintarō also watched over Momo from afar while she was in Junior High school, and as time went on, noticing her strange ability to attract attention even though he didn't understand it well at the time. In the manga's second timeline, he eventually would encounter Ayano again, this time as strangers; who requests his assistance.

:Later on in the manga's alternate second timeline, he would officially join the Mekakushi Dan again. He does so by going to their new hideout, and encounters Ayano. Though Ayano initially tries to point out he doesn't have an eye power to protect himself while seeming [[Love|nervous]] by his presence; Shintarō goes on to explain: he thought, if there was "someone he could save", he'll "keep struggling" to "protect that person", "and that person can be no one else" but Ayano herself. He declares he'll use all of his "life force" to "fight" for her, also declaring, "I'm here to help you!". Ayano responds by blushing terribly in her shock and surprise, and he is accepted into the Dan's hideout.

:In the music video for the "Music Route" song "Additional Memory" (2018), it is revealed Ayano apparently loved Shintarō since the very start all along, saying she didn't want to be "just" "friends". This revelation and seeming realization to herself occurs as she continuously falls from the buildings' rooftop, eventually waking up in the Heat Haze, appearing to herself as a classroom in monochrome colors while warped. Ayano sees the classroom from the sky as well, and seems to come to another realization; later encountering who appears to be Marry (in "Queen" form), while a physical snake (in snake form) appears above a then-leaning Ayano (as she leans in front of the also-kneeling Marry). Ayano would then go on to say (as she falls continuously, and seemingly not in person); "I'm sorry", "''Sayonara''", (lit. "goodbye" or "farewell"), and "Daisuki da yo" (lit: "''I love you''"), to who is indicated to be "Shintarō" (seen as he looked previously in the beginning of the "Lost Time Memory" music video, where he walked with Ayano down the street to their school).

;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Hibiya}}|ヒビヤ|Hibiya}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Hibiya Amamiya}}|雨宮 響也|Amamiya Hibiya}}
:{{voiced by|[[Misuzu Togashi]]}}
:Hibiya is member No. 8 of Mekakushi Dan. He is mentioned to be mature for his age, and is shown to have an immense crush on Hiyori. In the novels and anime, he joins Mekakushi Dan after being spotted escaping the hospital he was at after an accident. His songs are {{Nihongo|"Kagerou Daze"|カゲロウデイズ||"Heat Haze Daze"}} and {{Nihongo|"Otsukimi Recital"|オツキミリサイタル||"Moon-viewing Recital"}} (with Momo Kisaragi). Though it is not his song, he also appears in {{Nihongo|"Konoha no Sekai Jijō"|コノハの世界事情||"Konoha's World Situation"}}.

:As a sixth grade primary schooler, he is the youngest member of the group, at 12 years old (in "Mekakucity Talkers", he prepares to take Junior High exams, and later meets back up with Hiyori "at school" in what's initially implied to be a post-summer scenario.). He has the "Eye Focusing" ability, meaning he can see distant objects from an aerial view. He is originally from a village in the rural countryside and came with Hiyori Asahina to the city for the summer. He stayed at Hiyori's sister's house for the visit and met Konoha, who was living there at the time.

:Hibiya sees Hiyori die in a traffic accident and somehow becomes stuck in a time loop trying to save her from dying, each time ending with him sacrificing himself to try and save Hiyori. He comes in contact with the Heat Haze and is given the snake of 'Focusing Eyes'.

: In {{Nihongo|"Konoha no Sekai Jijō"|コノハの世界事情||"Konoha's World Situation"}}'s music video in "music route", Hibiya has seemingly "switched" the timeline, and is now the one dying repeatedly; while Hiyori is seen witnessing this, shocked and crying. Konoha tries to reach them both in time, but is unable to, as he is not visible physically at the time. Though they are different "routes", the novels appear to reference a similar event, as well - an upset Hibiya tells Konoha, "''you were just standing there and watching!''". The implication is that Hibiya actually ''could'' see Konoha during this point of time, at least, in the novels timeline. (The song contains the lines, from Konoha's point of view; "With my wobbling see-through body; My hand won't reach them in time.") In the 3rd novel, "The Children Reason", Shintarō even references and repeats the line, when he discusses with Kido the possibility that Hibiya remembers the events of him being in the Heat Haze, both initially concluding that Hibiya ''did'' remember.

:In the music, anime, and novels timeline, during "Otsukimi Recital", Hibiya is depressed because he hasn't been able to save Hiyori. Momo notices his depression, dragging him along to get him to partake in various "fun" events. In the music timeline, this involves things such as eating an extremely large meal (Hibiya only takes a bite), playing games at the arcade (where he slowly begins to seem to have fun), and trying on clothes and costumes (one of which involves Hibiya crossdressing while wearing a maid dress, as Momo gets him to do so.) The two later sit by the curb, where Hibiya's soda hits him in the eyes in a similar fashion to how Momo's own hit hers in "Kisaragi Attention". Momo continues to drag him along; and they reach a park. Hibiya begins to have flashbacks of Hiyori smiling, petting a cat, as Momo does the same thing, albeit getting scratched by one. As he begins crying again, Momo realizes the situation is desperate, and puts on a "recital" before him, encouraging him as her eyes turn red, drawing his attention. The full moon is visible behind them in the music video, relating to the song's title ("Moon-viewing Recital"), while in the anime, they are inside as she gives a performance on stage, again drawing his attention with her red eyes. At the end of the music video, he hesitantly reaches out for what seems to the viewer (and possibly him) as the back of Hiyori's dress; instead, he reaches Momo's hand. The two realize he's holding her hand, Momo getting an increasingly mischevious expression, while Hibiya becomes embarrassed and tries to look away. However, Momo grabs him by the hand and pulls him along happily, Hibiya now seemingly back to "normal". Shintarō watches over them and his sister from afar with a grin (behind a tree), as does Kido, who is also there when Momo awakens after seemingly fainting from using her ability. In the novels, Momo and Hibiya head back. Hibiya proceeds to call Momo by only her name ("Momo"), instead of the rude nicknames he was using for her before (such as "Aun", similar to "auntie", implying she was middle aged, or "old"). Momo had previously requested he stop calling her those, and the fact Hibiya does so implies their relationship became closer, by means of [[Japanese honorifics|yobisute]].

:In the manga's second alternate timeline, Hibiya instead comes out of the Kagerou Daze with the Snake of Clearing Eyes, who proceeds to possess him and hunt down the Mekakushi Dan, after throwing Momo off a building. Clearing Eyes, using Hibiya's body, breaks through a window of the same building, falling far below. Clearing Eyes, still using Hibiya's body, then proceeds to speak to Konoha and the rest, telling them they can't change what is happening. Using Hibiya's body, Clearing Eyes moves towards the nearby street. While Hiyori runs to the scene from afar, Konoha chases after from a closer distance, reaching out with his hand in order to reach Hibiya - only to watch, yet again, as Clearing Eyes, possessing Hibiya, throws Hibiya's body into the street, right in front of the incoming truck. As Hiyori approaches, watching in shock, Hibiya appears to finally regain his consciousness, before he tells Hiyori, "I'm sorry", eyes full of tears.

:Though Hibiya and Konoha were both in front of the truck as it strikes, as Konoha was still reaching out for Hibiya; Clearing Eyes then uses the opportunity to jump to Konoha's body and leaves the scene. On the news Kano watches, three days passed since. Hibiya's corpse, as well as Momo's, were burned and thus unidentified. But since there were other wounds besides those caused by the "accident", there are chances the two were involved in some kind of case. Hibiya's status from then on is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Kagerou Daze Manga&lt;/ref&gt;

:Because Hibiya's birthday is November 4th, and because it would take place before Ayano's birthday of November 22nd, he would be 13 during such a post-summer scenario, such as during the ending of Mekakucity Actors. In comparison, Hiyori's birthday, March 3rd, would place her on the "younger" end of her school year (the [[Education in Japan|Japanese school year]] begins in April and ends in late March.) This is also despite Hibiya and Hiyori's official ages not matching up with a real-world based timeline.

:{{voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]]}}
:Konoha is member No. 9 of Mekakushi Dan. Shown to be a rather absent-minded individual, he has a large appetite, similar to his human self as Haruka. His songs are {{Nihongo|"Konoha no Sekai Jijō"|コノハの世界事情||"Konoha's World Situation"}}, {{Nihongo|"Yūkei Yesterday"|夕景イエスタデイ||"Yesterday Evening"}} (as Haruka), {{Nihongo|"Outer Science"|アウターサイエンス}} (as Black Konoha), and {{Nihongo|"Summertime Record"|サマータイムレコード}} (as both, or Haruka).

:As a human, Haruka suffered from an illness which caused him to have "attacks" and collapse, making him have less time to live, hence making him wish for a body that would not be as vulnerable, and hence being placed in a separate class with Takane Enomoto. With the interference of Kenjirō, he suffers an attack and dies, entering the Heat Haze with Takane, and therefore receiving the "Awakening Eyes" ability, which allows him to live in his ideal body. However, instead of being sent back like the others in the Heat Haze, Haruka stayed in the Heat Haze while the Snake of Awakening Eyes inhabits his body as Konoha, attempting to carry on Haruka's wishes of spending time with his friends. After this, the amnesiac Konoha stays at Ayaka's house, where he meets Hibiya and Hiyori and attempts to save them from the Heat Haze.

:Though Konoha is born from such means, he is seen as being overall different from Haruka - Takane even noting such in the anime (and Ene thus calling Konoha "imposter") and is treated as being his own person. He is noted to have an "[[Immortality|immortal]] body".&lt;ref name="Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012"/&gt;

:In "Summertime Record", the "ending theme" for the overall series, Konoha appears to "join" with Haruka's body, disappearing, and Haruka gaining Konoha's same mark on his cheek, as well as a slightly changed look. The specific events that lead to this occurrence were unknown. However, the various other endings show alternative fates for Konoha - in the anime, Konoha appears to disappear, Haruka regaining his physical body (only seen in the shadows, from afar), and Konoha's shadow briefly "seen" (to the viewer) running separately; in "in a Day's", the MX4D short movie, Konoha is instead seen leaving together with the rest of the Mekakushi Dan after they stop the terrorist incident all together (sans Ayano, and with both Hibiya and Hiyori, as well as Ene instead of Takane) only to be implied killed (with the rest) by the hidden bomb underneath the building at the end, Clearing Eyes seemingly never appearing; in the manga's first timeline, he is possessed by Clearing Eyes, and kills the then-formed Mekakushi Dan (sans Hibiya or Hiyori, who were instead unable to enter the mall due to an incident, and left outside of it; only to still have the timeline repeated) very early on; in the manga's second timeline, he is taken over by Clearing Eyes yet again after it leaves Hibiya's body, which Clearing Eyes possessed. In the "Mekakucity Talkers" spinoff, Konoha is again seen still "alive" along with the rest of the Mekakushi Dan (sans Hiyori, and with Hibiya, as well as Ayano and Ene). The implication that Hibiya is studying for Junior High school and later returns to school ("after" the summer would be over, while meeting up with Hiyori "at school") seems to imply Konoha (as Konoha, and possibly not Haruka) as well lives past "an" August 15th-18th in that timeline, if temporarily. However, Talkers would also later (in Chapter 31) bring up the location of the "amusement park" in passing.

:An alternate version of Konoha appears in Outer Science, notably during the "Music Route", called Black Konoha (also dubbed as Kuroha by Japanese fans, {{Nihongo|''kuro''|黒}} meaning 'black'), and kills everyone in Route XX. In Route 1 (notably during "Lost Time Memory", in "Music Route") for unknown reasons, he attempts to shoot himself in the head, only to be saved by Shintarō; "Kuroha"'s eyes widening in shock as he watches Shintarō fall (it is unknown if the one shocked in "Music Route" was Konoha, or Clearing Eyes himself). In the anime, "Kuroha" is revealed to be the snake of 'Clearing Eyes', Kenjirō's eye ability, which has transferred itself to Konoha (termed "forming" in him) and possessed him, believing him to be a stronger vessel.

:{{voiced by|[[Mai Nakahara]]}}
:Ayano is member No. 0 of the Mekakushi Dan and was the daughter of Kenjirō and Ayaka Tateyama. Shown to be a happy-go-lucky girl with rather poor grades, she was the deskmate of Shintarō, and it is suggested that her poor grades stemmed from her family matters. Her songs are {{Nihongo|"Tōmei Answer"|透明アンサー||"Transparent Answer"}}, {{Nihongo|"Ayano no Kōfuku Riron"|アヤノの幸福理論||"Ayano's Theory of Happiness"}}, and {{Nihongo|"Adishonaru Memorī"|アディショナルメモリ|"Additional Memory"}}.

:In most major timelines after her parents briefly fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; three young children with red eyes, Kido, Seto, and Kano, she decided to fulfill her role as "big sister" (''"onee-chan"'') by creating the Mekakushi Dan to encourage them. After the death of her mother in a landslide and the discovery that her father was experimenting on her friends in an attempt to bring her back to life, Ayano grew increasingly concerned of the safety of the "trio". She committed suicide by jumping off the roof of her school in an attempt to save her family and friends from the plot of the snake that gives Kenjirō the 'Clearing Eyes.' She gets possessed by a snake and obtains the 'Favoring Eyes,' which allows her to project her thoughts and emotions unto others.

:In the manga's alternate first timeline, she is there with Marry when the landslide happens, now killing both her parents. She receives Favoring Eyes as a result, as well as the memories of Azami. Becoming far more stoic and cynical, she comes to the conclusion that to save the trio from harm, she must kill Marry, the catalyst of the tragedies to come. Kido punches Ayano hard enough to draw blood (reflecting a similar incident from their past when they were younger, and Kido was still new to the household) but Ayano doesn't change her mind. Extremely angered, shocked, and fearing for Marry's well-being and life, the trio then kick Ayano completely out of the house, cutting all ties with Ayano. In turn, she never meets Shintarō or her other school friends, but also doesn't remain trapped in the Daze. Unfortunately, her relationships with all of the trio worsened to an extreme as a result as well. When meeting her again, Kano addresses her extremely coldly as "''o''nee-chan" (formal [[Japanese honorifics|Japanese honorific]], meaning similar to "big sister") instead of "''n''ee-chan" (informal [[Japanese honorifics|Japanese honorific]], meaning similar to "sister"), something he had never done before that. As the manga's storyline continued, many further events would eventually lead to Kano reconciling with Ayano, reinstating her "''n''ee-chan", however, she would be unable to reconcile in person with the already dead Kido, and Seto who was busy at the time taking care of Marry.

:In the fifth novel "The Deceiving", alternative events would again occur from other timelines, in which a young Kano meets young Ayano at the park one day, a short time before he initially dies being killed during a robbery (and before they would have met at her household), and thus meeting as strangers at the park. Ayano swung from the metal bar at the park, only to then have a brief conversation with Kano, in which he didn't reveal his name to her (and she didn't get to reveal hers to him). Kano would then come to mentally describe Ayano as "Park Girl", remembering her to the point of being able to take on her form, including while at the orphanage, before they meet the Tateyamas and Ayano again later on, and again are fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; temporarily at the household. This event does not seemingly occur in any other timeline but the novels.

:An Ayano that Shintarō meets at some times (in the real world) is revealed to also be Kano (including in the novels) using his "Deceiving" ability, who does so to spite Shintarō, whom he believes caused Ayano's death. However, Kano would later apologize for the incidents in the seventh novel ("From the Darkness") and Shintarō forgives him, genuinely befriending Kano. Kano would go on to believe (thinking to himself) he was no match for Shintarō. Kano also notes to himself Shintarō would "show a different kind of smile" to "Ayano only"; then thinking Shintarō showed "that kind of smile" to Kano himself as well, showing they fully reconcile.

:An Ayano that Shintarō meets in the Heat Haze at other times is revealed to be his own snake, taking on her form wearing her black school uniform, but without her red scarf.

:In the short novel "My Little Daze", an encounter and first meeting with Shintarō at Junior High school 2 years before the main series begins is told through her point of view (as his point of view is told in the drama CD track for the same event). There, she meets Shintarō for the first time in Junior High school. She initially mistakes Shintarō for a girl because of his surname ("Kisaragi") sounding feminine, being slightly shocked when she learns he is a boy. This information is revealed to her through a female teacher at the school, who Ayano speaks with after the teacher notices Ayano in a daze during a ceremony (Ayano herself describing it as a "daze", while she had been imagining what it'd be like to be a "hero", as her father talked of). When the teacher glares at Ayano, Ayano describes it as similar to a "frog that was being glared at by a snake". The teacher lets Ayano go, revealing Shintarō was male, and Ayano would then meet Shintarō in person. Though Shintarō treats her same as he always does at the start, in the drama CD track and short novel, he appears to also be regarding Ayano while doing so. Ayano later asks Shintarō to tutor her, and Shintarō agrees "just for today" after an initial pause. Ayano was "so happy" she "felt like jumping up and down, but figured that was probably a bad idea, and stopped" herself. She asks if they would "finally" "be able to become friends", asks if her "pounding chest" was going to be "able" to "stand this", then concludes, "no", she was "going to be fine". Her father once told her "A pounding chest is the proof of justice", so she was "definitely going to be fine". The entire story from both forms of media appears to reflect the beginning of "Transparent Answer"'s music video in the "Music Route", albeit told in a different way, and with different events and perhaps results. As Ayano also does not mention the "trio" of Kido, Kano, and Seto at all during this entire monologue, it is unknown if they would take the trio into her household in this series of events. Before the series was adapted into other published media such as the manga, novels and anime, Ayano was also never described in connection with the trio until the "Ayano's Theory of Happiness" music video debuted, revealing a connection there, before the anime. She was instead described initially as "taking care of her father and friend", implied to be Kenjirō and Shintarō respectively, during a timeline where only her mother died.&lt;ref name="Mekakushi Dan Official Website"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daze/Days cd "My Little Daze" Short Story&lt;/ref&gt;

:In Route 1, after Shintarō (in red jersey) meets the real Ayano in the Heat Haze, she passes her eye ability to him.

:In the music video for the "Music Route" song "Additional Memory", it is revealed she apparently loved Shintarō since the very start all along, saying she didn't want to be "just" "friends". This revelation and seeming realization to herself occurs as she continuously falls from the buildings' rooftop, eventually waking up in the Daze, appearing to her as a warped classroom in monochrome colors and covered in flowers. Ayano sees the classroom from the sky as well, and seems to come to another realization; later encountering who appears to be Marry (in "Queen" form), while a physical snake (in snake form) appears above a then-leaning Ayano (as she leans in front of the also-kneeling Marry). Ayano would then go on to say (as she falls continuously, and seemingly not in person); "I'm sorry", "''Sayonara''", (lit. "goodbye" or "farewell"), and "Daisuki da yo" (lit: "''I love you''"), to who is indicated to be "Shintarō" (seen as he looked previously in the beginning of the "Lost Time Memory" music video, where he walked with Ayano down the street to their school).

:She is stated to have initially died during her first year of [[Education in Japan|high school]], when she would still be about 15 years old (as the event of her death happens on August 15th, while her birthday isn't until November 22nd); however, she was also in the same class as Shintarō, being his classmate, thus making them close in age. Since Shintarō (with an April 30th birthday) is already 18 during the main series, Ayano would be 18 post-series (by November 22nd) when "alive" as well. (In the official spinoff series "Mekakucity Talkers", [[Autumn|autumn]] is also implied approaching, in Chapter 31. The format of the real-world [[Education in Japan|Japanese school year]], which begins April 1st and ends in late March, also implies Ayano's age range.)

:{{voiced by|[[Keiji Fujiwara]]}}
:Kenjirō is the father of Ayano and husband of Ayaka. He was also Haruka and Takane's homeroom teacher and is Momo's tutor. His song is {{Nihongo|"Dead and Seek"|デッドアンドシーク}}.

:He possesses the ability of 'Clearing Eyes' and seems to know about Medusae. When he was in university, he fell in love with Ayaka, who turned him down, not interested in such a pathetic man. This caused him to become much more hard working and taking studying more seriously. After that, he was able to marry Ayaka. Together they had Ayano and temporarily fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kido, Kano and Seto. Kenjirō was interested in the theory of Medusae and researched it with Ayaka, only to be caught in a landslide with her and die. He came in contact with the Heat Haze and was possessed by the snake of 'Clearing Eyes'. He became much more engrossed in research after Ayaka's death, eventually experimenting on and killing his two students (Takane and Haruka), this was done while possessed by the snake of 'Clearing Eyes'. His fate is that he dies and reunites with Ayaka in the Heat Haze; in Route XX, the snake of 'Clearing Eyes' (while it is possessing Konoha) kills him.

;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Hiyori}}|ヒヨリ|Hiyori}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Hiyori Asahina}}|朝比奈 日和|Asahina Hiyori}}
:{{voiced by|[[Kotori Koiwai]]}}
:Hiyori is a stubborn young girl from the countryside who yearns for the city. She is very popular at her school and has her own fan club. She drags Hibiya to the city with her in order to get Momo's autograph and stays at her sister's, Ayaka, house. She falls in love with Konoha who was staying there at the time. She becomes involved in a traffic accident and gets stuck in a time loop trying to save Hibiya, but while Hibiya successfully escapes the Heat Haze, she passes away. Despite her apparent pessimistic personality and constant insults she uses towards Hibiya, she truly cares about him. She seemingly thinks of him as an important person; since she never saw her distant older sister before her sister's death; and, because of her popularity that makes it harder for her to be friends with others. She appears in {{Nihongo|"Kagerou Daze"|カゲロウデイズ||"Heat Haze Daze"}} together with Hibiya, who mostly tells the song through his point of view, changing to Hiyori's only in the final verse. She also appears in {{Nihongo|"Konoha no Sekai Jijō"|コノハの世界事情||"Konoha's World Situation"}}, now witnessing Hibiya dying, while shocked and crying. Konoha tries to reach them both in time, but is unable to, as he is not visible physically at the time.

:In the manga's alternative second timeline, she became one of the protagonists. After entering the Heat Haze by what seems to be an "accident", she seemingly gained the 'Focusing Eyes' in Hibiya's stead as he was the one who received the 'Clearing Eyes' instead. Hiyori eventually helps the Mekakushi Dan after the aftermath of the 'Clearing Eyes' incident.

:In the final novel for the novels' timeline ("Summer Time Reload"), Hiyori eventually became an official member of the Mekakushi Dan sometime after the aftermath of witnessing Hibiya dying repeatedly in previous timelines. She is "invited", or "forced", by Ene, who she describes as the "noisy blue girl", to become the now officially "10th" member.

:Because Hibiya's birthday is November 4th, and because it would take place before Ayano's birthday of November 22nd, he would be 13 during such a post-summer scenario, such as during the ending of Mekakucity Actors. In comparison, Hiyori's birthday, March 3rd, would place her on the "younger" end of her school year (the [[Education in Japan|Japanese school year]] begins in April and ends in late March.) This is also despite Hibiya and Hiyori's official ages not matching up with a real-world based timeline.

;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Shion}}|シオン|Shion}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Shion Kozakura}}|小桜 紫苑|Kozakura Shion}}
:{{voiced by|[[Akemi Okamura]]}}
:Shion is a 1/2 medusa and Marry's mother. When Shion was younger, she lived with her parents Azami and Tsukihiko. She loves Marry very much, and in order to protect her she refrains from letting Marry play outside. One day, Marry bypasses her mother's orders and plays outside anyways, however some boys come to attack her. She sacrifices herself in order to save Marry, and uses her eye power to turn the boys to stone; but the strain on her body was too much and she passes away with Marry.

:She gets consumed by the Heat Haze and is given the 'Combining Eyes' ability, however she passes the power on to Marry and sends her to the outside world. Her song is {{Nihongo|"Gunjō Rain"群青レイン||"Ultramarine Rain"}}.

;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Azami}}|アザミ|Azami}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Azami}}|薊|}}
:{{voiced by|[[Satomi Arai]]}}
:Azami is a full medusa and Shion's mother. Snakes grow from her hair, each with a unique power. She once thought humans were 'dull creatures that die easily' but fell in love with a human named Tsukihiko and started a family. After realizing how short human lives were compared to her immortality, she goes away to use the power of the snakes to create a Never Ending World (The Heat Haze) where she could live with her family forever. It is currently unclear if she waited for her family to arrive in the Heat Haze, before realising that her husband would have died by then, or that when she returned, the villagers attacking her house made her revert to her original ideology, causing her to return to the Never-Ending World alone.
:Many years later, her daughter and granddaughter, Shion and Marry were killed on August 15. Knowing this, she was unable to bear her grief and ordered the Heat Haze to "bring in every person who died on August 15", giving the ability of 'Combining Eyes' to Shion to allow her to return to life (who gave it to Marry). This causes her to lose control of the Heat Haze, thus drawing in every person who had died on August 15, the day Marry died, it is presumed that she died due to her power completely taken over by him and eventually suffocating to her death. Her body is later used by the Snake of The Clearing Eyes so that he might able to use her power to find a perfect vessel for him which is Konoha, In the end she finally able to peacefully die with Shion by her side ,finally freed from the torture she's suffering for very many years. Her song is {{Nihongo|"Shinigami Record"|シニガミレコード||"Death-God Record"}}.

She gave birth to Ayano and temporarily fostered&lt;ref name="mekakushidan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[「EDWORD RECORDS」]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kido, Kano and Seto from the orphanage after hearing about their strange abilities. She died in a landslide with Kenjirō while researching, passing on her trademark red clips to Ayano.

;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Tsukihiko}}|ツキヒコ|Tsukihiko}}
:{{voiced by|[[Takehito Koyasu]]}}
:A soldier who fell in love with Azami. Tsukihiko is a white haired, light-eyed man, and has long been considered a "monster" by the other villagers, due to his appearance. He tells Azami that he is also a "monster", and that they should spend their life together. Together, they had Shion and live peacefully until villagers attacked their home, mistakenly thinking he had been held captive. He is referred to by Azami in {{Nihongo|"Shinigami Record"|シニガミレコード||"Death-God Record"}} while also being seen with Azami and the younger Shion together in the music video for the song "Days".

;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Rin}}|リン|Rin}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Rin Kido}}|木戸 凛|Kido Rin}}

:Tsubomi's older sister who died when their family home was burned down. She was directly killed by Kido's biological father, who also set the fire that killed them.

:In "Mekakucity Actors", she would later encounter the young Tsubomi while Tsubomi is in the Daze, surrounded by "fire", Rin "speaking" to Tsubomi.

:While Rin remains trapped in the Daze during most routes, she would also later appear briefly in the novels, as well as being referred to by Kido.

;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Black Konoha}}|黒コノハ|Kuro Konoha}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|}}Snake of Clearing Eyes|目が冴える蛇|Me ga Saeru Hebi}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]]}}
:A snake who, seemingly previously as a "Wide Eyed Snake", suggested to Azami to create the Heat Haze. It is the true antagonist of the series. :Its songs are {{Nihongo|"Outer Science"|アウターサイエンス||}} (as himself) and {{Nihongo|"Dead and Seek"|デッドアンドシーク||}} (''while formed in Kenjirō'').

:In many timelines, it took control of Kenjirō's body and survived under his wish of reuniting with his wife, going to extremes by doing so. Its true goal, however, is living forever. Also in many timelines, it transfers itself to Konoha's body and possesses it, causing Konoha's appearance to change into a "darker" look as well (wearing a full black version of Konoha's clothing, and with black hair).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:However, in the manga's alternate second timeline, he initially possesses Hibiya Amamiya instead, only body-jumping to Konoha later on (after killing Hibiya, by throwing Hibiya while Clearing Eyes is still using his body into the path of an incoming truck). Konoha was trying to reach Hibiya in time, but is unable to. Though both Hibiya and Konoha are seen in "front" of the truck just before it strikes, Clearing Eyes would then body-jump to Konoha, as the truck kills Hibiya, surrounding them with fire.

:In many timelines, it then kills all the members of the Mekakushi Dan besides Marry, and has her reset the timeline. This happens by means of her Combining Eyes ability, used through her by the snake of 'Clearing Eyes', who "awakens" her&lt;ref name="Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012"/&gt;(often in "Queen" form), and, by "collecting" the snakes that "have lost their owners",&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; she reverses time in order to save everyone. Marry seemingly reverses time at the end of every official "route" and "timeline" seen thus far.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:However, in the manga's alternate second timeline, Clearing Eyes takes on a new "look" for the first time, discarding Konoha's previous form while still seemingly in use of Konoha's body. On his body, notably his arms and legs, his skin takes on hues of pure black (also coming from the shadows surrounding him) while fading into a dark red [[color gradient]], his eyes being the same glowing dark red. Snake-like skin covers the top half of his face and cheeks, leaving the area around his mouth a light grey. His spiky hair hangs downwards, a large and long piece of which falling between his eyes, while two other equally long strands also frame his face.

:It's also revealed in the same alternate second timeline of the manga that Marry's "Queen" (of the snakes) power here causes a great toll on her body as it slowly deteriorates her body to the point she can't move at all, possibly a result of her being more human than gorgon. Despite her cheerful personality, a monologue in the manga implies that while she loves her friends, she harbors a grudge against the world for taking everything from her, reflecting some of the attitudes her grandmother Azami and her mother Shion held towards humanity. She begins to absorb the powers of the snakes of her fallen comrades. The Mekakushi Dan members left, including her, would then attempt to face off against the snake of Clearing Eyes.

:In the anime's timeline, it is seemingly "defeated" when Kenjirō's wish is granted and it has to comply to Konoha's wish, which was bringing Hiyori back life, so it becomes her surrogate life. It is eventually revealed that he was powered by the souls that were trapped in the haze. The Heat Haze was in fact not only created by Azami, but powered by the "wishes" of people who died on August 14th-15. Anybody who died on those days can't move into the afterlife at all, until someone with gorgon blood (Marry) who can use the Combining Eyes repeats the current timeline. Repeating the timeline in turn (seemingly) stops the haze and frees all of the dead souls that are trapped inside. This appears to permanently weaken the Snake of Clearing Eyes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:However, the "Kagerou Project Perfect Guide" (2016) would then reveal most "routes", or timelines, are repeated after all; including seemingly the initial anime's.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The MX4D short film's "route" seemingly does not contain Clearing Eyes at all, though it contains very different events from the initial anime's timeline, as the near-full Mekakushi Dan (sans Ayano, and with Ene, Konoha, Hibiya, and Hiyori all together) appear to stop the mall "incident"'s terrorist attack on their own and together, defeating other "new" characters who appear as the terrorists. However, at the end of the MX4D, a bomb is seen at the end, ticking down to zero, and indicating the timeline reset. It is unknown if Clearing Eyes exists in this timeline due to him not appearing physically or being referred to; however, the similar initial events (specifically, the start of the mall incident) may indicate he does. In the novels, it was also revealed he controlled nearly all of the city, including officials.

:In a short manga "Marry no Kakū Sekai" (マリーの架空世界, "Marry's Fictional World"), published near the start of the manga's alternate second timeline, Clearing Eyes faces Marry, who proceeds to use her power to turn him into stone. As she does so, Clearing Eyes, as "Black Konoha", with a bloodied scratch on his cheek and eyes widened in shock, surprise, and possibly even hurt, begins to become stone. However, Marry was later awoken at the Mekakushi Dan hideout by a worried Momo (the trio also being present). Marry would smile through her tears, realizing it was a "dream". This short manga having the same title as the song of the same name, where Marry sings and indicating herself repeating timelines so she can continue to remain with her friends, indicates it may not have completely been a "dream". "Marry no Kakū Sekai" (マリーの架空世界, "Marry's Fictional World") is also included by title at the end of routes similar to "Route XX", especially notable at the very end of the initial music "route", where it is placed after the events of "Konoha no Sekai Jijō" (コノハの世界事情, "Konoha's World Situation") and "Kagerou Daze" (カゲロウデイズ, "Heat Haze Daze") (which occur at the same time as each other), leading into "Outer Science" (アウターサイエンス) and concluding with "Marry no Kakū Sekai" (マリーの架空世界, "Marry's Fictional World") along with a repeat.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

| ShortSummary=The song has over 1,000,000 views on Nico Nico Douga. This is Kido's song, despite mostly being about the Dan rather than herself. This song used to be known as "Mekakushi Code", but was later called "Mekakushi Chord" in the "daze" PV and by official English translations of light novel and manga chapters named after the song.

The song describes the Dan as a gang that Kido leads, with various different members ranging from cyber beings to 18-year-old (or otherwise) hikiNEETs. They too go on missions regularly, with some assistance from Kido's ability to "blindfold".

| ShortSummary=This song was uploaded on September 30, 2011, and quickly gained in views, becoming Shizen no Teki-P's most popular song, and in turn the most popular song in the series. It has reached over 3,000,000 views in Nico Nico Douga. It also gave the ''Kagerou Project'' its name. This song was also featured in ''[[Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA F 2nd]]''.

On August 14th (at start), and (notably later) August 15, Hibiya and Hiyori are playing in the park, when they sight a black cat which Hiyori chases after, resulting in her death in a car accident and the two becoming trapped in a time loop that goes on for "decades". Hibiya then attempts to save Hiyori in vain, but when he finally succeeds, it is revealed that Hiyori will continue to try to save him - and vice versa.

On a normal day, the "country's president" announced that "the world was going to end", but by guidance of her future self (Ene), Takane (as her "Headphone Actor" character) was seemingly successfully able to escape as she still (as later implied in "Yesterday Evening"'s ending) had someone she needed to meet. However, upon reaching her destination, it is revealed to her by clapping scientists that she had "spent" her "life" in a "box". The scientist at her destination (implied to possibly be either Kenjirō, or Clearing Eyes as Kenjirō) congratulates her before "tossing a bomb", bombing the town, and implied killing her.

| ShortSummary=This song has also received a million views on Nico Nico Douga, and is the first IA song to do so. It is also known as {{Nihongo|"Sōzō Forest"|想像フォレスト||"Imagination Forest"}}. It was later "remade" (with slight animation changes and fixes, and an updated ending that now showed Seto's "older" design) as "Kūsō Forest" instead of "Sōzō Forest", but it is still more commonly known by its previous name.

The story of Marry is described, with her living alone and sheltered in a house, longing to go outside. Once, against her mother's warnings, she went out, and was bullied (leading to eventual torture), only to be saved by her Medusae mother who turned her attackers to stone, but died of (seemingly) the stress using her power caused. Later, a younger Seto chances upon her house, and recruits her to the Dan.

An alternate point of view of "Kagerou Daze", this time from Konoha's. He is somehow dragged into the time loop as well, but as he is (seemingly) not meant to be there, he cannot do anything to stop Hiyori and Hibiya's countless deaths and feels helpless about it.

The "Kagerou Project Perfect Guide" (2016) would later re-confirm it taking place alongside "Kagerou Daze" (at the same time) in the "Music Route" timeline.

He begins talking with the listener about a story of a boy who became a "monster" who always lied, being able to even shapeshift into some other forms (such as a female form), but lost sight of his true heart after being buried under so many "lies".

| ShortSummary=The song is the official "ending theme" and last song and music video of the overall project. The song tells what (seemingly) happens with Mekakushi Dan and with the characters after the end of the story.

A seeming "good end", it describes how the Dan comes back together again after everything is over and they have (seemingly) lost their eye powers. However, having grown up and become "adults", they can hardly remember themselves and each other from their times in the Dan anymore. They say goodbye to each other, and if they can remember; maybe they will all meet again.

However, in the "Kagerou Project Perfect Guide" (2016), multiple more "Routes" and otherwise timelines were confirmed; "Mekakucity Actors" (which contained this song) stated to be one of the "Routes", which may have been "repeated" after all; heavily implying more potential "Routes" were to come.

| ShortSummary=The ending theme for the "Mekakucity Actors" anime. It is sung by Lia, who also provided her voice for the Vocaloid IA, commonly used by Jin to make Kagerou Project songs. The song was composed by Shizen no Teki-P/Jin.

In the ending theme for the anime, illustrated by Sidu, Hiyori Asahina sits alone in a dark subway car, as the rest of the Mekakushi Dan slowly begin appearing around her, everyone in shadows. Most of the members appear to be sleeping, with Shintaro and some others keeping watch. The first one to appear by Hiyori's side is Hibiya Amamiya, sleeping against her in a similar fashion to an earlier scene from the end of "Konoha's World Situation", though the Hiyori here seems less natural, and more composed; a small, peaceful smile on her face the entire time. Konoha, as well, would soon appear sleeping against her other side. Suddenly, everyone around her vanishes, revealing Hiyori appearing to be alone; as she soon quickly fades away herself.

An official music video (also illustrated by Sidu) was also later released, this time showing Azami surrounded by her family, husband Tsukihiko and daughter Shion, in a much brighter looking subway car. However, as the video goes on, "glitch"-like things begin happening, and her family soon disappears. Azami begins crying as the imagery becomes somewhat darker. Suddenly, she opens her eyes, only to see a view of Hiyori Asahina in the subway car, surrounded by her sleeping (or otherwise) friends; the same as shown in the "Mekakucity Actors" ending theme.

It is unknown which one exactly sings the song (and may be both, in their different versions), also as Azami's version referenced the earlier Hiyori's/Mekakucity Actors' version. However, the lyrics appear to relate to both characters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4308">'''Kammeroper Schloss Rheinsberg''' is an international [[opera festival]] for young talented singers, founded and directed by German composer [[Siegfried Matthus]]. It takes place every summer at the historical [[Rheinsberg]] Castle, in [[Brandenburg]] ([[Germany]]). The festival presents the winners of the ''International Singing Competition Schloss Rheinsberg'', in which about 450 candidates from all over the world participate every year.

== Festival ==
The Chamber Opera Schloss Rheinsberg Festival&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kammeroper-schloss-rheinsberg.de/chamber-opera-rheinsberg.php  Festival Kammeroper Schloss Rheinsberg official website]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1990 by Siegfried Matthus, who also composed the opening opera: ''"Die Weise von Liebe und Tod des Cornets Christoph Rilke"''. In the last 20 years there have been more than 70 opera and concert productions. Experienced, renowned conductors and directors work with the young singers on opera roles under professional conditions and support the festival as members of the committee. Conductors have included [[Daniel Barenboim]], [[Kurt Masur]] and [[Christian Thielemann]], and directors have included [[Götz Friedrich]], [[August Everding]], [[Harry Kupfer]] and [[Axel Köhler]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portraits.klassik.com/Festival/portrait.cfm?OrganizerID=1310&amp;P=Festivals&amp;S=Festival&amp;C=Festival Account of the Festival (in German) on portraits.klassik.com]  Retrieved 13 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Festival has no orchestra of his own, but collaborates with many well-known German orchestras: [[RIAS Symphony Orchestra]], Junge Philharmonie Brandenburg, Neubranbenburger Philharmonie, [[:de:Brandenburgisches Staatsorchester Frankfurt (Oder)|Brandenburg State Orchestra]], Brandenburgische Philharmonie Potsdam, [[Rundfunkchor Berlin]], Brandenburger Symphoniker, [[Staatsorchester Braunschweig|Braunschweig State Orchestra]].

In 2000 the completely restored Castle Theater (''Schlosstheater'') opened its doors to the public. The Rheinsberg Opera Festival also has a rarity among theaters - the 18th century Garden Theater (''Heckentheater''), with capacity for 1000 spectators in a total area of 750 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The Opera Festival also uses rooms in Rheinsberg Castle for many concerts during the summer festival season.

[[Siegfried Matthus]] has been the Artistic Director of the Chamber Opera Schloss Rheinsberg since 1990, [[Claudia Eder]] is the Voice Advisor and Rainer Schwarz the Festival Manager and Executive Director. The Festival includes opera productions in both Castle and Garden Theaters, and many thematic concerts and masterclasses.

== Singers ==
The Chamber Opera Schloss Rheinsberg organises every year in [[Berlin]] the ''International Singing Competition Kammeroper Schloss Rheinsberg'', in which over 450 candidates from all over the world participate. The winners of the competition then have the chance to perform various  different roles required for the opera productions. Thus the singers of the festival are the chosen elite of young singers worldwide, and thousands of classical music fans travel to Rheinsberg to hear their young voices. Many highly talented young singers started a successful career through their appearance at the Rheinsberg festival. Singers who have started in Rheinsberg can be heard at the New York [[Metropolitan Opera]], [[La Scala]], [[Salzburg Festival]], other various international opera houses such as [[Royal Swedish Opera]] in Stockholm, Tokyo Opera House, [[Vienna State Opera]], [[Sydney Opera House]], [[Zürich Opera House]] and most German opera houses.

'''Khizr Muazzam Khan''' (born 1950) and '''Ghazala Khan''' (born 1951) are the [[Pakistani American]] parents of [[United States Army]] Captain [[Humayun Khan (soldier)|Humayun Khan]], who was killed in 2004 during the [[Iraq War]]. The couple received international attention following a speech at the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]] that criticized [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]].

==Biography==
Khizr Khan was born in 1950, the eldest of ten children, to [[poultry farm]]ing parents in [[Gujranwala]], a city in [[Pakistan]]'s [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] Province.&lt;ref name="nytimes5august2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/06/us/khan-soldier-convention-iraq.html|title=Moment in Convention Glare Shakes Up Khans' American Life|last=Kleinfield|first=N.R|date=August 5, 2016|work=New York Times|last2=Oppel |first2=Richard A.

Khizr passed the Punjab [[bar (law)|bar]] in 1974. Once married, the couple moved to [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]] to earn money to move to the United States. Two of their sons, Shaharyar and [[Humayun Khan (soldier)|Humayun]], were born in Dubai.&lt;ref name="nytimes5august2016"/&gt;

===Immigration to the United States===
They moved from the UAE to the United States in 1980. Their first home in the US was in [[Houston, Texas]], where the family stayed while Khizr went to receive [[LL.M.]] degrees from the [[University of Missouri Law School]] in 1982 and [[Harvard Law School]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="HJIL"&gt;{{cite journal |work=[[Houston Journal of International Law]] |issue=6 |date=1983 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlxLAQAAIAAJ |page=23 |last=Khan |first=Khizr Muazzam |title=Juristic Classification of Islamic Law |quote=Khizr Muazzam Khan**&lt;br&gt;** LL.B., 1974 Punjab University Law College, LL.M, 1982 University of Missouri Law School; Specializing in International Trade Law in Saudi Arabia, the U.S., and Pakistan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian21october2017/&gt; In 1986 they also became [[Citizenship of the United States|American citizens]].&lt;ref name="nytimes5august2016"/&gt; Khizr, Ghazala, and their two sons then moved to [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], where their third son, Omer, was born.&lt;ref name="nytimes5august2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes29july2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/us/elections/khizr-humayun-khan-speech.html|title=In Tribute to Son, Khizr Khan Offered Citizenship Lesson at Convention|last=Oppel|first=Richard A., Jr.|date=July 29, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sfchronicle27july2016"&gt;{{cite web|work=San Francisco Chronicle|title=How Khizr Khan prepared for anti-Trump DNC speech|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Dad-of-Muslim-war-hero-to-address-Democratic-8477913.php|last=Aleaziz|first=Hamed|date=July 27, 2016|accessdate=August 1, 2016|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khizr went on to work at the Washington, D.C., office of the [[law firm]] of [[Hogan &amp; Hartson]], one of the largest lobbying firms in the United States, where he was employed as the firm's manager of litigation technology from 2000 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/07/29/dnc-speaker-khizr-khan-a-man-of-character-say-former-big-law-colleagues/ |title=DNC Speaker Khizr Khan a Man of Character, Say Former Big-Law Colleagues |first=Katelyn |last=Polantz |date=July 29, 2016 |quote=Khan spent seven years, from 2000 to 2007, in the Washington, D.C., office of then-Hogan &amp; Hartson. He served as the firm's manager of litigation technology.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Humayun Khan===
{{main|Humayun Khan (soldier)}}
Their middle child, Humayun, attended the University of Virginia, where he became a cadet in its [[Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps|Army ROTC]] program. Upon graduating in 2000, he was commissioned in the [[United States Army|Army]] as a way to earn money for law school and because, according to Khizr, Humayun "felt that ROTC had completed him as a person, and he wanted to give back."&lt;ref name=wapo22march2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=UVA Top News Daily|title=U.Va.'s ROTC Divisions Pay Tribute to Fallen Comrade|date=September 24, 2004|last=Kelly|first=Matt|url=http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/09_24_2004/khan.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917020122/http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/09_24_2004/khan.html|archivedate=September 17, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rose to the rank of [[Captain (United States)|captain]] and served in Iraq during the [[Iraq War]]. In 2004, at the age of 27, Humayun was killed in [[Baqubah]], Iraq, in an explosion. He was inspecting a guard post when he saw a suspicious vehicle approaching. Ordering his subordinates to stay back, he stepped forward to engage. The car was later determined to have been carrying more than 200 pounds of explosives, and when it detonated he was killed along with the two [[suicide attack]]ers.&lt;ref name="nytimes29july2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sfchronicle27july2016/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo22march2005"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/specials/homefront/khan_article.html |title=Looking for Logic Amid the Pain: Grieving Father Struggles to Understand |last=McCrummen |first=Stephanie |date=March 22, 2005 |newspaper=Washington Post |archive-url=https://archive.is/20160811135332/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/specials/homefront/khan_article.html |archive-date=August 11, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }} (reposted July 28, 2016 as [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/khizr-khans-loss-a-grieving-father-of-a-soldier-struggles-to-understand/2016/07/28/18e8139a-552d-11e6-bbf5-957ad17b4385_story.html "Khizr Khan's loss: A grieving father of a soldier struggles to understand"] (archived [https://archive.is/20160731022538/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/khizr-khans-loss-a-grieving-father-of-a-soldier-struggles-to-understand/2016/07/28/18e8139a-552d-11e6-bbf5-957ad17b4385_story.html July 31, 2016]))&lt;/ref&gt; He was posthumously awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal]] and [[Purple Heart]] and is interred at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="nytimes5august2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes29july2016/&gt;

===Move to Virginia===
Following Humayun's death, the Khans moved to [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], to be closer to their other sons.&lt;ref name=nytimes5august2016/&gt; Ghazala began working at a fabric store and Khizr continued his legal consulting, working in [[commercial law]] and specializing in [[electronic discovery]].&lt;ref name=nytimes5august2016/&gt; They became heavily involved with the University of Virginia ROTC program, where Humayun had been a cadet, and became known as the "mom and pop of the department".&lt;ref name=nytimes5august2016/&gt;

In 2008, the Khans participated in an HBO [[documentary]], ''Section 60: Arlington National Cemetery'', featuring visitors to the section of [[Arlington National Cemetery]] where their son, and many other United States military personnel who died in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, are buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A deeply personal look at the Khan family's loss|url=http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2016/08/02/khan-parents-visit-son-grave-site-hbo-sot-lead.hbo|publisher=CNN|date=August 2, 2016|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/section-60-arlington-national-cemetery/index.html|title=Section 60 Arlington National Cemetery: Home|publisher=HBO|access-date=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
The Khans were not publicly political prior to 2015. In the 1980s, Khizr was a strong supporter of [[Ronald Reagan]], but in 2015 he had a strong negative reaction to then-candidate Donald Trump's speech [[Trump travel ban|promoting the idea of banning Muslims from entering the country]]. He gave an interview on the subject to a reporter for ''Vocativ'', published in December 2015.&lt;ref name=guardian21october2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=vocativ&gt;{{cite web|work=Vocativ|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=December 9, 2015|last=King|first=James|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/vocativ/the-father-of-a-muslim-wa_b_8758646.html|title=The Father Of A Muslim War Hero Has This To Say To Donald Trump}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Khizr's speeches and writings focus on United States founding documents, and in particular the Constitution. He was introduced to them as a law student in Pakistan, and found them both profound and thought-provoking.&lt;ref name=wapo25october2017/&gt; Starting in 2005, Khizr began carrying [[pocket constitution]]s with him, which he would read from and give to University of Virginia ROTC cadets.&lt;ref name=guardian21october2017/&gt;

===2016 DNC speech===
[[File:Khizr Khan Trumps TheDonald.webm|thumb|250px|Khizr Khan speaks at the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]]]]

Prior to the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]], [[Hillary Clinton]]'s campaign reached out to the Khans about speaking at the event. The couple deliberated and eventually agreed, believing it to be what Humayun would have done, despite protests from their other sons that it would make them targets for criticism.&lt;ref name=guardian21october2017/&gt; In planning for the speech, Ghazala opted not to speak on stage, worried that she would not be able to maintain her composure if a picture of her son were with them.&lt;ref name=guardian21october2017/&gt;

Trump began by suggesting that [[Hillary Clinton]]'s campaign staff had written the speech (according to Khizr, they wrote it themselves),&lt;ref name=Carter-2016-07-30/&gt; and said, "I think I've made a lot of sacrifices ...

After Trump's [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] victory in the presidential election, in response to his announced nominations for [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]] positions before the [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]], Khizr Khan urged the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] to reject Senator [[Jeff Sessions]] as [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], pointing out the Senate's rejection of Sessions in 1986 for a federal judgeship over racism concerns, and adding that Sessions "does not understand patriotic dissent."&lt;ref name="Nelson-2017-01-09"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nelson|first1=Louis|title=Khizr Khan urges Senate panel to oppose Sessions' confirmation|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/khzir-khan-jeff-sessions-confirmation-233357|accessdate=February 1, 2017|work=Politico|date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khizr also voiced opposition against Trump's [[Executive Order 13769|travel ban]] on seven Muslim-majority countries, threatening an anti-Trump boycott if the ban was not repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Siddiqui |first=Sabrina |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/01/khizr-khan-trump-travel-ban |title=Khizr Khan, Gold Star father, warns of anti-Trump boycott after travel ban |work=The Guardian |date=February 1, 2017 |accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2017, Khan canceled a planned speaking engagement in [[Toronto]] and said he had been told that his travel privileges were being reviewed.

'''Kodee Kennings''' is the name given to a fictitious 8-year-old girl, supposedly the daughter of a U.S. Army soldier named '''Dan Kennings''' in [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|post-invasion Iraq]]. Kodee's plight was detailed in letters published in the ''[[Daily Egyptian]]'', a student newspaper for [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale|Southern Illinois University]] in [[Carbondale, Illinois]], beginning in 2003.

==Hoax==
The story was concocted by '''Jaimie Reynolds''', a woman who claimed to be '''Colleen Hastings''', caregiver of the fictional Kodee. Reynolds allegedly passed a letter supposedly written by "Kodee," to Michael Brenner, who was then a sports editor at the ''Egyptian'' which prompted a feature story published May 6, 2003. In the article, "Kodee" told how upset she was by an [[anti-war]] protest at the university campus, and of her worries about her father "Dan" who was shipping off to Iraq with the [[101st Airborne Division|101st Airborne]]. Kodee's mother was said to be dead.

Over the next year, the ''Egyptian'' would publish, unedited, notes and letters from "Kodee", liberally strewn with misspellings and phonetic English, to update their readers about Dan's Iraq service or Kodee's daily life. A young friend of Reynolds, Caitlin Hadley, the daughter of a [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarene]] [[minister of religion|minister]], was recruited to play the part of Kodee for photographs, and a nurse, Patrick Trovillion, played Dan. Both believed that they were playing parts in a movie. "Kodee" was taken to the ''Egyptian'' newsroom and other Carbondale locations. "Dan" was photographed wearing [[camouflage]], sitting on a [[tank]], and meeting with school children in [[Michigan]]. "Dan" also called the newsroom and maintained an e-mail address at [[Yahoo!]] "Dan" was even portrayed as having been injured in a December, 2004 explosion in a mess hall at a base near [[Mosul, Iraq]]. He reportedly returned to duty just weeks later, and was later injured by an [[improvised explosive device|roadside bomb]] which struck a [[Humvee]] in which he was traveling.

Reynolds also apparently penned a guest editorial published in the name of a real war widow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newshound.de.siu.edu/voices04/stories/storyReader$487 |title=Voices : 'Freedom don't come free' |last=Goldsmith |first=Shayla |date=August 26, 2005 |work=[[Daily Egyptian]] |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516104628/http://newshound.de.siu.edu/voices04/stories/storyReader%24487 |archivedate=May 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the author claimed that her late husband had been a war buddy of Kennings'.

To further attempt to turn her hoax into reality, Jaimie Reynolds would dial the ''Daily Egyptian'' newsroom and – unbeknown to DE staff – allegedly disguise her voice to pretend to be the fictional girl "Kodee Kennings" wanting to talk to staff.

Throughout the hoax, Jaimie Reynolds also passed herself off as the twin sister of the fictional "Colleen Hastings" and visited the ''Daily Egyptian'' newsroom alternating as either Jaimie or "Colleen." Reynolds was a broadcast-journalism student at Southern Illinois University and graduated in 2004, putting her in classes alongside ''Daily Egyptian'' staff.

==Exposure==
The hoax unraveled when Reynolds claimed in August 2005 that Kennings had died in Iraq. This news was published in the ''Egyptian'', leading reporters from the ''Tribune'' to seek an interview with "Hastings." These reporters became suspicious when Reynolds routed interview requests through Brenner, who had become a close friend of hers.

Reynolds and Hadley (as "Hastings" and "Kodee"), along with members of the ''Egyptian'' staff, attended a memorial service arranged at the local [[American Legion]] outpost. After openly weeping at the service, Reynolds and Hadley met with ''Tribune'' reporters briefly at a restaurant, where they were told that media liaisons at [[United States Department of Defense|The Pentagon]] were unable to confirm the existence of Kennings. Reynolds refused to provide any proof of Kennings' existence. Days later, reporters located her at her mother's home in [[Marion, Illinois]], where she admitted to participating in the hoax.

Brenner was duped by Reynolds. After numerous articles in the ''Chicago Tribune'', the Associated Press, the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' and the ''Daily Egyptian'' itself, it appeared no crime was committed. The parents of Hadley were particularly upset, however and considered a [[restraining order]] against Reynolds.

Subsequent attempts to contact Reynolds after news of her hoax broke were unsuccessful. Reynolds went so far as to change the identity of her cell-phone voicemail from the fictional "Colleen Hastings" to "Blank Blank."

==Investigation==
The ''Daily Egyptian'' subsequently investigated the hoax that had been perpetrated on its own paper. In part due to that investigation, the ''Egyptian'' won the Illinois College Press Association's General Excellence Award in 2006, as well as first place in the Investigative Reporting category.

The '''Komische Oper Berlin'''&lt;ref&gt;The names mentioned should not be confused with similar names of other theatres in Berlin. The theatre is not identical to the "Theater unter den Linden" which operated from 1933 to 1945 in the former "Kleines Theater" at Unter den Linden 44; nor to the "Staatsoper Unter den Linden", the [[Berlin State Opera]]. Neither is it identical to the "Metropol-Theater" that operated in the former [[Admiralspalast]] from 1955 into the 1990s. Furthermore, today's "Komische Oper" has no connection to the "Komische Oper (an der Weidendammer Brücke)" which operated from 1905 into the 1920s as an opera theater, later as an operetta theatre, and finally as a revue theatre.&lt;/ref&gt; is a German opera company based in [[Berlin]].  The company produces [[opera]], [[operetta]] and [[musical theatre|musicals]].

The opera house is located on Behrenstraße, just a few steps from [[Unter den Linden]]. Since 2004, the Komische Oper Berlin, along with the [[Berlin State Opera]], the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]], the [[Berlin State Ballet]], and the Bühnenservice Berlin (Stage and Costume Design), has been a member of the Berlin Opera Foundation.

== History of the building ==
[[File:Komische Oper Berlin interior Oct 2007 Zuschauerraum.jpg|thumb|Interior of Komische Oper Berlin]]
[[File:Komische Oper Berlin interior Oct 2007 Bühne.jpg|thumb|Stage of Komische Oper Berlin]]
The theatre was built between 1891 and 1892 by architects [[Fellner &amp; Helmer|Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer]] for a private society. It first opened on 24 September 1892 as ''"Theater Unter den Linden"'' with Adolf Ferron's operetta ''Daphne'' and Gaul and Haßreiter's ballet ''Die Welt in Bild und Tanz''.

The theatre was primarily a vehicle for [[operetta]], but was also used for various other events and balls. Around 800 people could be seated in the stalls, and the balconies and various en-suite dinner rooms housed about a further 1,700 seats. Its directors went bankrupt in 1896 and the theatre was forced to close its doors.

On 3 September 1898 the theatre was reopened as ''Metropol-Theater'' with Julius Freund's revue ''Paradies der Frauen''. It then grew to become one of Berlin's most famous and successful variety theatres. During the 1920s and early 1930s, it was leased by the brothers Alfred and Fritz Rotter. Under their management, it saw the premieres of two operettas by [[Franz Lehár]] - ''Friederike (opera)'' in 1928 and [[Das Land des Lächelns]] in 1929, both starring [[Richard Tauber]]. However, due to a decline of variety and music hall entertainment the theatre was again closed in 1933.

In 1934 the theatre was nationalised and renamed ''Staatliches Operettentheater''. It operated as part of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] ''[[Strength Through Joy|Kraft durch Freude]]'' entertainment and leisure programmes. During [[World War II]], the auditorium was damaged by Allied bombing on 7 May 1944. The façade, entrance hall, and auditorium ceiling murals were destroyed by bombs on 9 March 1945.

After the war, the theatre was in [[East Germany]], being that the building was in the eastern part of Berlin. Following repair works and provisional rebuilding, the theatre reopened on 23 December 1947, as the ''Komische Oper'' with Johann Strauss's operetta ''[[Die Fledermaus]]''.

The 1950s saw various further alterations and extensions. The theatre was completely rebuilt in 1965/1966 by Architektenkollektiv Kunz Nierade, adding functional extensions and giving the theatre a completely new exterior. The theatre reopened again on 4 December 1966, with Mozart's ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. The auditorium underwent further restoration in 1986, and the stage technology was further modernised by 1989. Today the theatre seats 1,270.

== The Komische Oper company ==
In 1947, [[Walter Felsenstein]] founded and led the resident opera company, the ''Komische Oper'', until his death in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DE153EF937A15755C0A966958260&amp;pagewanted=all | title=East Berlin Opera Nervously Awaits The Next Act|work=The New York Times|date=24 June 1990|accessdate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Götz Friedrich]] was an assistant to Felsenstein at the company. Joachim Herz became general director after Felsenstein's death and served until 1981. Subsequently, [[Harry Kupfer]] directed the company for 21 seasons, until 2002. The company specializes in German language productions of opera, operetta and musicals. In 2007 the company won, jointly with [[Theater Bremen|Oper Bremen]], the "[[Opera house of the year]]" award by the German magazine ''[[Opernwelt]]''. From 2002 to 2012, the company's chief director and ''Intendant'' was [[:de:Andreas Homoki|Andreas Homoki]]. In June 2008, the company announced the appointment of [[Barrie Kosky]] to succeed Homoki as its next ''Intendant'', as of the 2012/2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Komische Oper Berlin: Barry Kosky neuer Intendant|url=http://www.focus.de/kultur/musik/komische-oper-berlin-barry-kosky-neuer-intendant_aid_313525.html?drucken=1|work=[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]|date=24 June 2008|accessdate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2014, his contract with the company was extended through 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.welt.de/newsticker/dpa_nt/infoline_nt/boulevard_nt/article133108341/Barrie-Kosky-bleibt-bis-2022-in-Berlin.html | title=Barrie Kosky bleibt bis 2022 in Berlin | work=Die Welt | date=2014-10-09 | accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2005, the company's managing director has been Susanne Moser.

From 1966 to 2004, the theatre was also home to a resident ballet company – first as the "Tanztheater der Komischen Oper", and then from 1999 as "BerlinBallett – Komische Oper". In 2004, due to budgetary problems, the separate ballet companies of Berlin's three opera houses were merged into a single company called the [[Berlin State Ballet|Staatsballett Berlin]].

Past General Music Directors (GMD) of the company have included [[Kurt Masur]], Rolf Reuter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Berliner Dirigent Rolf Reuter gestorben|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/article1176319/Berliner_Dirigent_Rolf_Reuter_gestorben.html|work=[[Die Welt]]|date=11 September 2007|accessdate=20 November 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yakov Kreizberg]], [[Kirill Petrenko]], [[Carl St.Clair]], and Patrick Lange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Frederik Hanssen|title=Meister von morgen|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/meister-von-morgen/1841954.html|work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|date=20 May 2010|accessdate=20 November 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2012, the GMD of the company is Henrik Nánási.  Nánási is scheduled to conclude his tenure at the end of the 2017-2018 season.  In May 2017, the company announced the appointment of Ainārs Rubiķis as its next GMD, effective with the 2018-2019 season, with an initial contract of 3 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://komische-oper-newsroom.hosted-application.de/download/11712/pm_20170508_rubikis_neuer_gmd_ab18_19.pdf | title=Ainārs Rubiķis ab 2018/19 Generalmusikdirektor an der Komischen Oper Berlin | publisher=Komische Oper Berlin | date=8 May 2017 | accessdate=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is intended to be a list of notable accidents that occurred during the shooting of films and television, such as cast or crew fatalities or serious accidents that plagued production. It is not intended to be a list of every minor injury an actor or stuntman suffered during filming. Stuntwork accounts for over half of all film-related injuries, with an average of five deaths for every 2,000 injuries.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} From 1980 to 1990, there were 37 deaths relating to accidents during stunts; 24 of these deaths involved the use of helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uic.edu/sph/glakes/harts1/HARTS_library/stunts.txt|title= Stunt Safety By Michael McCann, Ph.D., C.I.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1910s==
* ''Across the Border'' (1914). On July 1, 1914, while on location in [[Canon City, Colorado]], cast member Grace McHugh was filming a scene where her character was crossing the [[Arkansas River]] in a boat.  When the boat capsized, camera operator Owen Carter immediately jumped into the river to save her.  He dragged her onto a [[sandbar]] that was actually [[quicksand]]. The rest of the film crew watched helplessly as they were sucked into the quicksand and drowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org/cgi-bin/colorado?a=d&amp;d=CTR19140702.2.5|title=Grace McHugh, Golden Girl, Is Drowned|author=Staff|work=([[Golden, Colorado|Golden]]) [[Golden Transcript|Colorado Transcript]]|page=1|date=July 2, 1915|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915). Future film director [[Erich von Stroheim]] fell off a roof and broke two ribs in one scene as an extra.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}
*[[The Girl of the Golden West (1915 film)|''The Girl of the Golden West'']] (1915). Actor [[House Peters Sr.]] suffered serious burns to his face and hands when a prop pistol exploded upon being fired.&lt;ref&gt;Katchmer, George A. ''Eighty Silent Film Stars: Biographies and Filmographies of the Obscure to the Well Known.'' Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 1991. p-785.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[The Captive (1915 film)|''The Captive'']] (1915). During filming of a scene where soldiers were required to break down a locked door, the extras fired at the door using live ammunition to give the scene more realism. The director then ordered the extras to reload with blanks in order to film the next shot in which the door is broken down. But one of the extras inadvertently left a live round in his rifle which discharged, shooting another extra, Charles Chandler, in the head, killing him instantly.&lt;ref&gt;DeMille, Cecil B., and Donald Hayne, ed. ''The Autobiography of Cecil B. DeMille''. London: W.H. Allen, 1960. p-116-117.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Woman God Forgot]]'' (1917). In one scene, extras were required to be thrown over the side of an Aztec pyramid. The 'pyramid' was built of wood and covered in paper on which sand had been glued to create the appearance of stone. The extras were 'sand-papered' as they slid down the side of the structure. Having expected such injuries, a crew member was waiting at the bottom with a bucket of iodine.&lt;ref&gt;Fountain, Leatrice G., and John R. Maxim ''1985: Dark Star''. London: Sidgwick &amp; Jackson. p-189.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Valley of the Giants (1919 film)|The Valley of the Giants]]'' (1919). Silent era star [[Wallace Reid]] was badly injured in a train crash during filming in Oregon. His injuries caused him severe pain and the studio supplied him with increasing quantities of morphine so he could keep working. Addicted to morphine and also suffering from alcoholism, Reid died in 1923 at the age of 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldensilents.com/stars/wallacereid.html |title=Wallace Reid (1891-1923) |publisher=''Golden Silents'' |accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Unidentified [[Henry Lehrman]] Comedy (1919): Comedian [[Billie Ritchie]], while working on a short comedy film, was kicked in the stomach by an [[ostrich]] and sustained internal injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bearmanormedia.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;filter_name=massa&amp;product_id=638 Steve Massa- Lame Brains and Lunatics pp. 66-67]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1920s==
* ''[[Haunted Spooks]]'' (1920). On the set of a publicity shoot that took place while filming, actor and comedian [[Harold Lloyd]] picked up what he thought was a prop bomb with the fuse lit but realized too late the bomb was real. It detonated, blowing off the thumb and first finger of his right hand and also temporarily blinding him. For the rest of his career, Lloyd concealed his missing fingers with a prosthetic glove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silentfilm.org/archive/girl-shy-1924 |title=''Girl Shy'', 1924 |publisher=San Francisco Silent Film Festival |accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Skywayman]]'' (1920). Pilots Milton Elliott and [[Ormer Locklear]] were killed on 2 August 1920, during filming. Their plane crashed at the DeMille Airfield, along Wilshire Blvd. in Los Angeles, while filming night scenes.&lt;ref name="Farmer1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farmer|first=James H.|title=Broken wings: Hollywood's air crashes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAMIAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 May 2012|year=1984|publisher=Pictorial Histories Pub.

*[[Manslaughter (1922 film)|''Manslaughter'']] (1922). Stunt man Leo Noomis was required to crash a police motorcycle into the side of a car at 45 miles per hour. Noomis suffered six broken ribs and a fractured pelvis while performing the stunt.&lt;ref&gt;Wise, Arthur, and Derek Ware. ''Stunting in the Cinema''. London: Constable, 1973. p-43.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Souls for Sale]]'' (1923). Actress [[Barbara La Marr]] injured her ankle during filming and doctors prescribed not only morphine but also cocaine to control the pain and enable her to continue filming. Working on the production left La Marr addicted to drugs, a factor that contributed to her premature death three years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://barbaralamarr.com/Page_2.html |title=Barbara La Marr Biography |author=Lore, Anne |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'' (1924). While hanging from a water tower, [[Buster Keaton]] pulled a rope that released water from the tower, knocking him to the ground. In the scene, he stood and ran into the distance. During a routine physical examination 11 years later, an X-ray revealed that Keaton's neck had been fractured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silentfilm.org/pages/detail/3691|title=Sherlock Jr., 1924|work=Silent Film Festival|last=Johansson|first=David|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Warrens of Virginia (1924 film)|The Warrens of Virginia]]'' (1924). On 29 November 1923, while working on location in [[San Antonio, Texas]], [[Martha Mansfield]] was severely burned when a match, tossed by a cast member, ignited her [[American Civil War|Civil War]] costume of [[Hoop skirt|hoopskirts]] and flimsy ruffles. Mansfield was playing the role of Agatha Warren and had just finished her scenes and retired to a car when her clothing burst into flames. Her neck and face were saved when leading man Wilfred Lytell threw his heavy [[overcoat]] over her. The [[chauffeur]] of Mansfield's car was burned badly on his hands while trying to remove the burning clothing from the actress. The fire was put out, but she sustained substantial burns to her body and died the following day.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Times]]'', "Martha Mansfield, Film Star, Dies of Burns Caused by Costume Fired by Smoker's Match", 1 December 1923, Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1925). An early filming attempt of the chariot race was done on location at the [[Circus Maximus]] in Rome. It brought about the death of one stuntman when a wheel of his chariot broke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Parade's Gone By...|last=Brownlow|first=Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Brownlow|year=1969}} quoted in {{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/benhur.asp|title=Ben-Hur|work=snopes.com|last=Johnson|first=Judy|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The General (1926 film)|''The General'']] (1926). During filming of the epic comedy in Oregon, there were a number of incidents. Several National Guardsmen, employed as extras for the Civil War battle scenes, were injured by mishaps caused by misfired muskets or explosions. Director and star Buster Keaton was knocked unconscious when he stood too close to a cannon firing. Assistant director Harry Barnes was accidentally hit in the face by a blank charge. Train brakeman Fred Lowry sued the production for US$2,900 after his foot was crushed when it was run over by a locomotive wheel during filming of one of the railway scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/indie/busterkeaton/Filming.html |title=The Filming of ''The General'' |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'' (1927). During filming of the World War I aerial combat scenes, stunt pilot [[Dick Grace]] was required to deliberately crash-land a [[Fokker D-VII]], specially modified to "crumple" on impact. When the Fokker struck the ground, the landing gear failed to crumple, making the impact a heavier one than planned. This caused Grace's safety straps to break, sending his head through the instrument panel, leaving him with four crushed vertebrae and a broken neck. Amazingly, Grace spent only six weeks in the hospital and was back performing stunt work within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silentsaregolden.com/articles/aviationstuntmen.html |title=Daredevils in the Air: Three of the Greats – Wilson, Locklear and Grace |author=Lussier, Tim |publisher=''Silents Are Golden'' |date=2004 |accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Noah's Ark (1928 film)|Noah's Ark]]'' (1928). Three people died, one man lost a leg and a number were injured in a scene where several hundred extras were caught in the "[[Genesis flood narrative|Great Flood]]." The deaths were instrumental in the introduction of film safety regulations the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Baxter, John O. |title=Stunt; the story of the great movie stunt men |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, N.Y |year=1974 |pages= |isbn=0-385-06520-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Aviator (1929 film)|''The Aviator'']] (1929). During aerial scouting for locations, an aircraft crashed, killing cameraman Alvin Knechtel and actor and stunt pilot [[William Hauber]].&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/safety-set-camera-crew-outnumber-stunt-personnel-4-165559917.html |title=Safety On Set: Camera Crew Outnumber Stunt Personnel 4-To-1 In On-Set Deaths |author=Robb, David |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |date=8 April 2014 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Godless Girl]]'' (1929). The filming of one scene required cast members [[Lina Basquette]] and [[George Duryea]] to be trapped in a burning building and both actors had their clothing, hair and exposed skin covered with an asbestos coating. During filming, Duryea, concerned that the pyrotechnic flames were getting too hot and too close, fled from the set but Basquette, eager to impress director [[Cecil B DeMille]], insisted on remaining until the scene was completed despite the intense heat. The actress suffered serious burns and blistering to her forearms and her eyebrows and lashes were singed.&lt;ref&gt;Basquette, Lina. ''Lina: DeMille's Godless Girl''. Fairfax, VA: Denlinger's Publishers, 1990. p-116-117.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unknown film (1929). [[Strongheart]], the [[German Shepherd]] film star, was accidentally burned after coming into contact with a hot studio light. The burn became tumorous, eventually leading to his death later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walkoffame.com/strongheart |title=Strongheart |publisher=[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] |accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1930s==
*''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'' (1930).

He was ready to bail out and called back to his mechanic Phil Jones (who was in the rear of the plane dumping lampblack to simulate smoke) to jump, but he didn't hear him and went down with the plane. Only one brief shot of the spinning Sikorsky was used in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=St. Louis Aviation|author=Jeremy R. C. Cox, St Louis Air and Space Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Celluloid Wings|author1=James H. Farmer |author2=Tab Books Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Such Men Are Dangerous]]'' (1930). During aerial filming off the coast of Southern California near Santa Monica on 2 January 1930, two [[Stinson Detroiter]] aircraft, employed as camera-planes, collided over the ocean. All ten men on board the two planes were killed, including director [[Kenneth Hawks]] (brother of [[Howard Hawks]]), assistant-director Max Gold, cinematographer [[Conrad Wells]], director of photography George Eastman, cameramen Otto Jordan and Ben Frankel, two property men and both pilots. Only five bodies were recovered. As it was one of the final scenes to be filmed, the movie was still completed on schedule. Families of the men who were lost took legal action against Fox Film Company but the courts ruled in favour of the latter.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/parker-v-james-granger-inc-24868 |title=Parker vs. James Granger, Inc. |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deadline Hollywood"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/04/movies-tv-on-set-deaths-camera-crews-stunts/ |title=Safety On Set: Camera Crew Outnumber Stunt Personnel 4-To-1 In On-Set Deaths |author=Robb, David |publisher=''Deadline Hollywood'' |date=8 April 2014 |accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Viking (1931 film)|''The Viking'']] (1931). After completion of filming in Canada, producer, co-director and real-life adventurer [[Varick Frissell]] decided that more footage of the [[Labrador]] ice floes was required. He and a small film crew joined the real ship ''The Viking'' on a seal-hunting voyage in order to obtain the footage he wanted. On 15 March, the ship became trapped in ice near [[Horse Islands (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Horse Isles]] and dynamite stored on board (intended for breaking up ice floes) accidentally detonated, destroying the vessel and killing 27 men, including Frissell and cameraman Alexander Penrod.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/466486%7C465795/The-Viking.html |title=''The Viking'' |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Four Frightened People]]'' (1934). During filming in Hawaii, actress [[Claudette Colbert]] was required to stand up to her neck in a real swamp. This scene was shot on her first day on set after having undergone an emergency appendectomy and Colbert and the director disregarded concerns raised by the on-set nurse. Filming in the unsanitary conditions while not yet fully recovered led to Colbert being hospitalized with a severe fever two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Quirk, Lawrence J. ''Claudette Colbert: An Illustrated Biography''. New York: Crown, 1985.p-62.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Lost Patrol (1934 film)|''The Lost Patrol'']] (1934). During filming in high temperatures in Buttercup Valley near [[Yuma, Arizona]], Director [[John Ford]] insisted his cast and crew only work in the early mornings and late afternoons to avoid the most intense heat of each day. Under pressure from RKO to speed up filming, Producer [[Cliff Reid]] insisted that the midday break be shortened. Ford refused, believing that many of the crew would be at risk of heatstroke in the 120-degree [[Fahrenheit|F]] conditions. Reid tried to prove his point by walking around in the open in the midday heat and soon collapsed with heat exhaustion, requiring hospital treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Nollen, Scott Allen. ''Three Bad Men: John Ford, John Wayne, Ward Bond''. Performing Arts Publishing, 2013. P-56.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[The Crusades (film)|''The Crusades'']] (1935). While filming a battle scene in which horses fall into a moat, four stunt riders sustained serious injuries which required hospitalization. All four of their horses were injured so severely they had to be destroyed. It was recommended that the injured stunt-men receive extra pay but director [[Cecil B DeMille]] refused, saying that the riders had 'bungled a simple scene'.&lt;ref&gt;Cary, Diana S. ''The Hollywood Posse: The Story of a Gallant Band of Horsemen who Made Movie History.'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1975. p-223-224.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936 film)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' (1936). During the filming of the charge sequence, a stuntman was killed when he fell off his horse and landed on a broken sword that was lying on the field, unfortunately wedged in such a position that its blade was sticking straight up. Also, due to the use of trip wires, three dozen horses had their legs broken and had to be shot during filming, resulting in the U.S. Congress passing laws to protect animals used in motion pictures.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}
*''[[Saratoga (film)|Saratoga]]'' (1937).  [[Lionel Barrymore]] broke his hip after tripping on a cable on the set that film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haun|first=Harry|title=NOISES OFF-BROADWAY AND BEYOND: ''The Old Man and the Moon'' Shines Bright and High Kicks Fill the ''Can-Can''|date=30 September 2014|publisher=''[[Playbill]]''|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/noises-off-broadway-and-beyond-the-old-man-and-the-moon-shines-bright-and-high-kicks-fill-the-can-can-com-331840|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' (1939). A horse was killed during the scene where it was ridden off a cliff into a river. This incident led to the [[American Humane Association]] opening a Hollywood office in 1940 and monitoring the treatment of animals in films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/18071/Jesse-James/articles.html|title=Jesse James|author=Jeremy Arnold|website=tcm.com|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939). [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] was badly burned during a scene in which her character, the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], "vanished" in a burst of flame and smoke.

*[[Hotel Imperial (1939 film)|''Hotel Imperial'']] (1939). Actor [[Ray Milland]] was seriously injured while filming a cavalry charge scene through a small village. While making a planned jump over an obstacle, the horse's saddle came loose and Milland fell into a pile of masonry. He spent a week in hospital with concussion, a 3-inch gash to his forehead and a badly injured left hand.&lt;ref&gt;Milland, Ray. ''Wide Eyed in Babylon''. New York: Morrow. 1974. p-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1940s==
*''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941). While filming, [[Orson Welles]] tripped down a staircase and chipped his anklebone, forcing him to use a wheelchair for the next two weeks.

*''[[My Life for Ireland]]'' (1941). An anti-British propaganda film made by the Germans. During the epic final battle scene, several extras were killed when one of them stepped on a live land mine.

*''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'' (1941). Three horsemen perished during the cavalry charge, one of whom was extra Jack Budlong, whose horse tripped as he rode alongside [[Errol Flynn]].

[[Jack Randall (actor)|Addison "Jack" Randall]] was killed at [[Canoga Park]], California, while riding a horse past the cameras at full speed on July 16, 1945, for a [[Universal Pictures]] [[Serial film|serial]], when he fell from the saddle while trying to retrieve his hat which had blown off his head, and struck a tree.

==1950s==
*''[[The Conqueror (1956 film)|The Conqueror]]'' (1956).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2609">The '''''Lucky-S'' incident''' occurred on January 7, 1993 when [[Turkish Navy]] vessels, carrying members of the [[Turkish Police|Turkish Narcotic Police]], intercepted the MV ''Lucky-S'', a Turkish ocean freighter in international waters in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The ship was suspected of being involved in smuggling illegal drugs into [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="tg1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tumgazeteler.com/?a=1345912 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717113237/http://www.tumgazeteler.com/?a=1345912 |title=''Kısmetim 1'' Davasında Yeni Karar |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |accessdate=January 18, 2009 |language=Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the second Turkish anti-drug-smuggling operation on the high seas in three weeks, following the [[Kısmetim-1 incident]].  {{convert|11039.550|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and {{convert|2568.010|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[morphine|morphine base]]&lt;ref name="tg1"/&gt; were captured on the ship, which was escorted to a Turkish port.

== Trial ==
A total of 11 individuals arrested as a result of the operation were convicted of involvement in the drug trade.&lt;ref name="ans"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ansiklopedi.turkcebilgi.com/Halil_Havar |publisher=Ansiklopedi |title=Halil Havar Hakkında Bilgi |accessdate=January 18, 2009 |language=Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nejat Daş]], who was also found to have organized [[drug trafficking]] by the MV ''Kısmetim-1'' and was imprisoned, escaped from custody on November 8, 1994, as he was brought from [[Sinop Fortress Prison]] to the 1st State Security Court in [[Istanbul]] for trial over his involvement in the Lucky-S incident. On March 16, 1995, he was sentenced in absentia to 24 years' imprisonment in a maximum-security prison.&lt;ref name="tg1"/&gt;

It was asserted that the drug on the ship belonged mostly to the Turkish [[drug lord]] [[Halil Havar]], son of the [[arms trafficking|arms trafficker]] Mehmet Havar. He was tried and sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment. He is serving his sentence in the maximum-security Uşak Prison.&lt;ref name="ans"/&gt;

On November 17, 1938 a joint decree No. 81 of [[Sovnarkom]] [[USSR]] and [[Central Committee]] of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] [[Decree about Arrests, Prosecutor Supervision and Course of Investigation]] and the subsequent order of the NKVD undersigned by [[Lavrentiy Beria]] cancelled most of NKVD orders of mass type (but not all, see, e.g., [[NKVD Order no. 00689]]) and suspended implementation of death sentences, signifying the end of the [[Great Purge]] ("Yezhovshchina").

[[Image:NZPWI_invitational 2006 poster.jpg|right]]
The '''NZPWI Invitational''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) event hosted by the website New Zealand Pro Wrestling Informer (NZPWI). The event was the first interpromotional show ever held in New Zealand and featured wrestlers from the country's three major promotions [[Impact Pro Wrestling]], [[Kiwi Pro Wrestling]], [[New Zealand Wide Pro Wrestling]], and Peter Ball's Major Impact Wrestling from [[Australia]] now called [[Impact Pro Wrestling Australia]]. Held annually in 2006 and 2007, it was primarily a [[single-elimination tournament]] and included a 20-man [[battle royal]] semi-main event. The battle royal would end via pin or submission between the last two entrants, the winner of which would receive an entry for next year's invitational.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/2127/1/ |title=Tuesday news: Drug testing, ECW tonight, Mexico, Tito vs. Ken rematch set, Tank to fight again, more |author=Alvarez, Bryan |authorlink=Bryan Alvarez |date=8 August 2006 |work=Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Online |publisher=F4Wonline.com |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCracken"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fighttimes.com/magazine/magazine.asp?article=520 |title=A New Tradition Begins as HAV Becomes NZPWI Invitational Grand Champion! |author=McCracken, Dion |date=August 2006 |work= |publisher=FightTimes.com |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.throng.co.nz/sport/sky-1-nzpwi-invitational-pro-wrestling |title=Sky 1: NZPWI Invitational Pro-Wrestling |author= |date=13 July 2007 |work=TV Highlights |publisher=Throng.co.nz |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OWW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/nzpwi-invitational/ |title=NZPWI Invitational |author=Ogilvie, Steve |author2=Kirsty Quested  |year=2007 |work=New Zealand Wrestling Promotions |publisher=OnlineWorldofWrestling.com |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was largely organised by Dion McCraken, NZPWI editor-in-chief, whose intention was to bring attention to [[professional wrestling in New Zealand]]. Similar to the [[ECWA Super 8 Tournament|Super 8 Tournament]] in the United States or the [[Super J-Cup]] in Japan, it showcased the top talent of New Zealand's "big three" and provided the first major television exposure for many independent wrestlers in the [[Australasia|Australasian region]] since the days of [[Steve Rickard]]'s "[[On the Mat]]" during the 1980s. The show also served as a reunion of sorts for older veterans of the era. [[John da Silva]], a champion amateur and pro wrestler during the 1960s and 70s, was in attendance at the 2006 invitational and presented the trophy to "Heartless" Alfred Valentine after winning the tournament.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCracken"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alvarez2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/2161/105/ |title=Monday notes: Raw, major WWE show moved, the TNA INFERNO, more |author=Alvarez, Bryan |authorlink=Bryan Alvarez |date=14 August 2006 |work=Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Online |publisher=F4Wonline.com |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Csonka"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/politics/columns/44061 |title=Various News: WWE Mexican Tour Changes and More |author=Csonka, Larry |date=14 August 2004 |work=Columns |publisher=411mania.com |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OWW"/&gt;

It was one of the largest show's ever held in New Zealand and the event received some coverage by the [[Media of New Zealand|national media]]. The 2006 NZPWI Invitational was promoted by ''Fight Times Magazine'' in March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fighttimes.com/magazine/magazine.asp?article=500 |title=New Zealand Pro-Wrestling Returns To The "Big Time"! |author=McCracken, Dion |date=April 2006 |work= |publisher=FightTimes.com |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Machine, an IPW wrestler and first entrant to battle royal, was featured in a [[Article (publishing)|cover story]] for the ''Horowhenua-Kapiti Weekend Chronicle'' on 29 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Meet The Machine |author=Burt, Andrew |newspaper=Horowhenua-Kapiti Weekend Chronicle |date=29 July 2006 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of its participants, IPW wrestlers Alfred Valentine and Jon E. King, were interviewed on [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV One]]'s morning talk show ''Breakfast'' by [[Kay Gregory]] days prior to the event.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Tuesday August&amp;nbsp;8 |episodelink= |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/497100/809128 |series=Breakfast |serieslink= |credits=[[Kay Gregory]] (Interviewer) |network=[[Television New Zealand]] |station=[[TV One (New Zealand)|TV One]] |airdate=8 August 2006 |season= |seriesno= |number= |minutes= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual NZPWI Invitational was held at the [[Lynfield, New Zealand|Lynfield]] [[YMCA]] on 12 August 2006, and was attended by a sell out crowd of 450 fans. It was the largest attendance for a live wrestling event in 20 years.&lt;ref name="Csonka"/&gt; The 2006 NZPWI Invitational was later shown on [[Sky1]] and proved so popular that the network aired on [[primetime]] the following year. The second show was broadcast following the 9 December 2007 edition of [[WWE Smackdown]],&lt;ref name="OWW"/&gt; and again on [[Christmas Eve]] followed by the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWE Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony]]. The program was watched by over 100,000 people on [[SKY Network Television|SKY Television]] and both invitationals later released on DVD. Dion McCracken served as the [[colour commentator]] for both shows, with co-host [[Vinny Dunn]] in 2006 and manager Gary O. Davis in 2007, and his performance led to a full-time position as the head announcer of ''[[IPW Ignition]]''.

Although plans were made to hold a third NZPWI Invitational in November 2008, the event was unable to gain the necessary [[corporate sponsorship]] to cover costs. Previous shows had been held at a significant loss, costing at least $15,000 to run, and almost entirely supported financially by McCraken himself. Due to the financial burden, as well as familial commitments, McCraken officially announced on NZPWI.co.nz that he would no longer be able to host the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzpwi.co.nz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4294&amp;Itemid=78 |title=The end of the line for the NZPWI Invitational |author= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Okinawa International Movie Festival''' is an annual [[Film Festival]] held in [[Ginowan]] City and [[Naha]] City on the Japanese island of [[Okinawa Island]]. The festival was founded by Japanese century-old comedy-entertainment giant [[Yoshimoto Kogyo]] in 2009 and focuses on comedy films from around the world, with the theme of "Laugh &amp; Peace".&lt;ref name="Hollywood Reporter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/okinawa-intl-movie-fest-open-303725 | title=Okinawa Intl Movie Fest to Open for Fun in the Sun| author= Gavin J. Blair | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=2012-03-23 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is held each year at the [[Okinawa Convention Center]] and Sakurazaka Theater with indoor and outdoor screenings of film premieres and recent movies from Japan and abroad. It also hosts fashion, music and trade shows and has been likened to a Japanese ''[[matsuri]]'' in atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Eye"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/okinawa-movie-festival-2012/ | title=Okinawa Movie Festival 2012| author= J.M.

The most prestigious award given out at the Okinawa International Movie Festival is the ''Golden [[Shisa]] Award'' for the best film, selected by a jury.

The 8th Okinawa International Film Festival was held from April 21, 2016 until April 24, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oimf.jp/ official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:2nd Okinawa International Movie Festival 002.jpg|thumb|right|Local performers on the red carpet at the 2nd Okinawa International Movie Festival, 2010]]
The concept for the festival was inspired by a visit to [[Cannes Film Festival]] by [[Yoshimoto Kogyo]] CEO Hiroshi Osaki. While watching the premiere of [[Hitoshi Matsumoto]]'s ''[[Dai Nipponjin]]'' he considered that the cost of making a film was higher than of putting on a festival, and so to allow people to enjoy watching films, perhaps his company could arrange their own.&lt;ref name="SBS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/films/movie-news/896243/Okinawa-International-Movie-Festival-Wrap-up | title=Okinawa International Movie Festival: Wrap-up | author= Russell Edwards | publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] | date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yoshimoto Kogyo]], which was started by Sei and Kichibei Yoshimoto in 1912 with a ''[[rakugo]]'' theater in the grounds Tenmangu Shrine in [[Osaka]], had been expanding throughout the 2000s with hundreds of new comedians graduating each year from New Star Creation, Yoshimoto's entertainment school. In addition it had spread out to manage athletes, producers and musicians, and two theatres in each of Tokyo and Osaka.&lt;ref name="FYI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20100518i1.html | title=Entertaining the nation | author= Alex Martin | publisher=[[The Japan Times]] | date=2010-05-18 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Busan Film Festival]] director Kim Dong-ho as a patron for the Okinawa International Movie Festival, he was able to give valuable advice while other staff brought expertise from [[Tokyo International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="SBS"/&gt; The [[1st Okinawa International Movie Festival]] took place over four days from March 19–22, 2009 at the American Village at Mihama Chatan-cho in [[Okinawa City]].

The location of Okinawa was selected for its natural beauty by the sea in order to replicate the atmosphere of Cannes, but with comedy at its heart.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2012/03/21/laughter-rules-at-okinawas-international-movie-festival/ | title=Laughter Rules at Okinawa’s Movie Fest | author= Robert Michael Poole | publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]] | date=2012-03-21 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before each screening, every film is introduced by one of comedy agency giant and organizer [[Yoshimoto Kogyo]]'s comedians.&lt;ref name="ShiftEast"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shifteast.com/fourth-okinawan-international-movie-festival/ | title= Fourth Okinawa International Movie Festival | author= Darrell Nelson | publisher= Shift East | date=2012-03-28 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival's largest screen is shipped over from Sweden and placed directly on the beach at [[Okinawa Convention Center]]. It measures just under 30m wide and 15m tall.&lt;ref name="ShiftEast"/&gt;

[[File:Meritxell edited.jpg|thumb|upright|Chapel of Meritxell, Andorra]]

'''Our Lady of Meritxell''' ({{lang-ca|Mare de Déu de Meritxell}}, {{IPA-ca|ˈmaɾə ðə ˈðew ðə məɾiˈtʃeʎ|IPA}}) is an [[Andorra]]n [[Roman Catholic]] [[statue]] depicting an [[Marian apparition|apparition of the Virgin Mary]]. Our Lady of Meritxell is the [[patron saint]] of [[Andorra]]. The original statue dated from the late 12th century. However, the [[chapel]] in which it was housed burned down on September 8 and 9, 1972, and the statue was destroyed. A [[replica]] can be found in the new Meritxell Chapel, designed in 1976 by [[Ricardo Bofill]].    

The [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[philologist]] [[Joan Coromines]] says that "Meritxell" is a diminutive of ''merig'', from the [[Latin]] ''meridiem'' (midday in English). Merig is a name used by shepherds to denote a pasture with lot of sun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vegueries.com/asp/rutasVCAT.asp?V=Andorra&amp;Id=94 Meritxell Chapel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
[[File:Santuari vell de Meritxell - 1.jpg|thumb|left|Old Sanctuary of Meritxell]]
In the late 12th century, on January 6, a wild [[rose]] in bloom was found by villagers from [[Meritxell]] going to [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in [[Canillo]].{{fact|date=October 2017}} It was out of season and at its base was found a statue of the [[Virgin and Child]].  
The statue was placed in the Canillo church. However, the statue was found under the same wild rose the next day.{{fact|date=October 2017}} [[Translation (relics)|The statue was taken]] to the church of [[Encamp]]. However, as before, the statue was again found under the same wild rose on the next day. As in similar legends elsewhere, the villagers of Meritxell took this as a sign and decided to build a new chapel in their town after they found an open space miraculously untouched by the winter snows.

'''Panguni Uthiram''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]:பங்குனி உத்திரம்) (also known as '''Meena Uttara-phalguni''' in [[Sanskrit]]) is a day of importance to [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Hindu]]s. It falls on the day the moon transits in the asterism or nakshatram of Uttara-phalguni or Uthiram in the twelfth month of the [[Tamil calendar]] i.e. Panguni. It is the [[Purnima]] or full moon of the month of Panguni (பங்குனி 14 March - 13 April). This coincides with the [[Hindu calendar]] month of [[Phalguna]] / [[Chaitra]].&lt;ref&gt;Nakshatra Uttara Phalguni[https://en.vedicencyclopedia.org/wiki/Uttara_Phalguni]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==

This month is special because the Uthiram nakshatram coincides with the full moon. This full moon signifies the marriage of [[Parvati]] and Parameswara (Lord [[Shiva]]), [[Murugan]] and Deivanai, and [[Aandaal]] (also known as Kothai) and Rangamannar took place. On Panguni Uthiram, Narayana marries Komalavalli Naachiyar and give his Kalyana Kola Seva to his Bhakthas. Again, [[Valmiki]]'s [[Ramayana]] says it is on this day and star that [[Sita]]'s marriage with [[Rama]] was celebrated. From Brahmanda Puranam we learn that on Panguni Uthiram every holy water joins Thumburu teertha (also spelt as Tirtha), one of seven sacred tanks in [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupati]] Tirumala. 

The day is intended to underline the glory of grahasta dharma (or the married life of a householder). The Almighty manifests in the marital state as Uma Maheswara, Sita Rama, and Radha Krishna – despite his changelessness, sans childhood or youth or old age. The Lord is indeed a Nitya Kalyana Murthi. It is our duty to celebrate this day when the Lord, in both Shiva and Vishnu temples, appears to devotees in his married state. On Panguni Uthiram, in all places where Lord Subrahmanya has a temple, his devotees carry in a kavadi the requisites for puja for him, in fulfilment of vows. Such vow fulfilment by devotees carrying kavadis is a special feature of Subrahmanya temples wherever they happen to be.

Devotees flock in hundreds to all the Murugan temples during the Panguni Uthiram festival, which is celebrated in March every year.[https://newsroom24x7.com/2017/04/28/panguni-uthiram-exclusive-from-bhopal/] It is the Jayanti (Day of Incarnation) of Lord [[Ayyappan]]. It is also an important festival day for Lord Subramanya (Muruga), as it is on this day that Sri Deivanai married Lord Subramanya. On this day Goddess Mahalakshmi incarnated on earth from the ocean of milk (after the ocean was churned by the Gods and the demons) and hence it is celebrated as Mahalakshmi Jayanti. On this day Goddess Parvati in the form of Gowri married Lord Siva in Kanchipuram and hence this day is also celebrated as the Gowri Kalyanam day.

== Other Significances of the day ==

The month of Panguni when coinciding with [[Phalguna]], sees the festival of [[Holi]] too. It is celebrated in the Braj region, which includes locations traditionally connected to the Lord [[Krishna]]: Mathura, Vrindavan, Nandagaon, and Barsana, Kumaoni ([[Uttarakhand]]); also as Basatotsav (Bengal), Phagwah (Bihar), Doḷajātra (Oriya), Ganga Mela (UP),  Dol Purnima (Bengal),  Śigmo (Konkani),  Rangapanchami (MP), Yaosang (Manipur), Basnata Panchami (AP), Phakuwa (Assam), Shimga (Maharashtra), Manjal Kuli (Kerala), Fagu Poornima (Nepal), Panguni Uthram Vasanthotsavam (TN). Mostly it coincides with the end of [[Rang Panchami]]; Phalgun Krushnapaksh Panchami celebrations, so called Panchami of Holi of Krishna, which carries on as a celebration of spring. The playful throwing of natural colored powders has a medicinal significance: the colours are traditionally made of Neem, Kumkum, Haldi, Bilva, and other medicinal herbs prescribed by [[Ayurveda]] doctors. A very auspicious day for all Hindus.

The day of Panguni Uthiram is of special significance to the worship of earth element, ''Prithvi lingam'' of [[Ekambareswarar Temple]], where festivities last for 13 days.&lt;ref&gt;Panguni Uthiram at Lord Ekambaranathar Temple [http://www.ekambaranathartemple.tnhrce.in/festivals.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Holiday ==

This occurs during the last month of the year known as Panguni (i.e. [[Phalguna]] / [[Chaitra]]). Panguni Uthiram is a famous festival and special to [[Murugan]] and [[Shiva]] devotees. The 2019 date is March 21, on Thursday.&lt;ref&gt;drikpanchang.com, Panguni Uthiram [https://www.drikpanchang.com/festivals/panguni-uthiram/panguni-uthiram-date.html?year=2019]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perestroika''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɛr|ə|ˈ|s|t|r|ɔɪ|k|ə}}; {{lang-rus|Перестро́йка|p=pʲɪrʲɪˈstrojkə|a=ru-perestroika.ogg}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc2/lectures/gorrev.html |title=Gorbachev and Perestroika |author=Professor Gerhard Rempel, Department of History, Western New England College, |publisher=Mars.wnec.edu |date=1996-02-02 |accessdate=2010-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828102933/http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc2/lectures/gorrev.html |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a political movement for reformation within the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] during the 1980s and 1990s and is widely associated with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and his [[glasnost]] (meaning "openness") policy reform. The literal meaning of perestroika is "restructuring," referring to the restructuring of the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet political]] and [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economic system]].

Perestroika is sometimes argued to be a significant cause of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the [[revolutions of 1989]] in [[Eastern Europe]], and the end of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20091116/kvh_cohen |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120525082937/http://www.thenation.com/doc/20091116/kvh_cohen |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 25, 2012 |title=Gorbachev on 1989 |author1=Katrina vanden Heuvel  |author2=Stephen F.

==Summary==
Perestroika  allowed more independent actions from various ministries and introduced some [[Market economy|market]]-like reforms. The goal of perestroika, however, was not to end the [[command economy]] but rather to make [[socialism]] work more efficiently to better meet the needs of Soviet citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Gorbachev, Perestroika (New York: Harper Collins, 1987), quoted in Mark Kishlansky, ed., ''Sources of the West: Readings in Western Civilization'', 4th ed., vol. 2 (New York: Longman, 2001), p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of implementing perestroika arguably exacerbated already existing political, social, and economic tensions  within the Soviet Union and is often blamed for furthering the political ascent of [[nationalism]] and nationalist political parties in the constituent republics. Perestroika and its associated structural ailments have been cited as major catalysts leading to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kotkin |first1=Stephen |title=Armageddon Averted |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic reforms==
In May 1985, Gorbachev gave a speech in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] in which he admitted the slowing of economic development, and inadequate living standards. This was the first time that a Soviet leader had done so.

The programme was furthered at the [[27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|27th Congress of the Communist Party]] in Gorbachev's report to the congress, in which he spoke about "perestroika", "[[uskoreniye]]", "[[Human factors|human factor]]", "[[glasnost]]", and "expansion of the [[khozraschyot]]" (commercialization).

During the initial period (1985–87) of Mikhail Gorbachev's time in power, he talked about modifying [[central planning]] but did not make any truly fundamental changes (''[[uskoreniye]]''; "acceleration"). Gorbachev and his team of economic advisors then introduced more fundamental reforms, which became known as ''perestroika'' (restructuring).

At the June 1987 [[plenary session]] of the [[Central Committee of the CPSU|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), Gorbachev presented his "basic theses", which laid the political foundation of economic reform for the remainder of the existence of the Soviet Union.

In July 1987, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] passed the Law on State Enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/04/world/new-struggle-in-the-kremlin-how-to-change-the-economy.html?pagewanted=1|title=New struggle in the Kremlin: How to change the economy|last=Bill|first=Keller|date=1987-06-04|work=The New York Times|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law stipulated that state enterprises were free to determine output levels based on demand from consumers and other enterprises. Enterprises had to fulfill state orders, but they could dispose of the remaining output as they saw fit. However, at the same time the state still held control over the means of production for these enterprises, thus limiting their ability to enact full-cost accountability. Enterprises bought input from suppliers at negotiated contract prices. Under the law, enterprises became self-financing; that is, they had to cover expenses (wages, taxes, supplies, and debt service) through revenues. No longer was the government to rescue unprofitable enterprises that could face bankruptcy. Finally, the law shifted control over the enterprise operations from ministries to elected workers' collectives. [[Gosplan]]'s ({{lang-ru|Госуда́рственный комите́т по планированию}}; ''Gosudarstvenniy komitet po planirovaniyu''; "State Committee for Planning") responsibilities were to supply general guidelines and national investment priorities, not to formulate detailed production plans.

The [[Law on Cooperatives]], enacted in May 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Karen M. (1988). ''[http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/13265/1/p88-29.pdf The Law on Cooperatives, Retail Food Prices, and the Farm Financial Crisis in the U.S.S.R.]'' ([[PDF]]). University of Minnesota. Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics. Retrieved on 14 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; was perhaps the most radical of the economic reforms during the early part of the Gorbachev era.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} For the first time since [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]] was abolished in 1928, the law permitted [[private ownership]] of businesses in the services, manufacturing, and foreign-trade sectors. The law initially imposed high taxes and employment restrictions, but it later revised these to avoid discouraging private-sector activity. Under this provision, cooperative restaurants, shops, and manufacturers became part of the Soviet scene.
[[Image:1988 CPA 5942.jpg|right|thumb|''Perestroika'' postage stamp, 1988]]

Gorbachev brought ''perestroika'' to the Soviet Union's foreign economic sector with measures that Soviet economists considered bold at that time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} His programme virtually eliminated the monopoly that the Ministry of Foreign Trade had once held on most trade operations. It permitted the ministries of the various industrial and agricultural branches to conduct foreign trade in sectors under their responsibility, rather than having to operate indirectly through the bureaucracy of trade ministry organizations. In addition, regional and local organizations and individual state enterprises were permitted to conduct foreign trade. This change was an attempt to redress a major imperfection in the Soviet foreign trade regime: the lack of contact between Soviet end users and suppliers and their foreign partners.

The most significant of Gorbachev's reforms in the foreign economic sector allowed foreigners to invest in the Soviet Union in the form of [[joint venture]]s with Soviet ministries, state enterprises, and cooperatives. The original version of the Soviet Joint Venture Law, which went into effect in June 1987, limited foreign shares of a Soviet venture to 49 percent and required that Soviet citizens occupy the positions of chairman and general manager. After potential Western partners complained, the government revised the regulations to allow majority foreign ownership and control. Under the terms of the Joint Venture Law, the Soviet partner supplied labor, infrastructure, and a potentially large domestic market. The foreign partner supplied capital, technology, entrepreneurial expertise, and in many cases, products and services of world competitive quality.

Gorbachev's economic changes did not do much to restart the country's sluggish economy in the late 1980s. The reforms decentralised things to some extent, although price controls remained, as did the ruble's inconvertibility and most government controls over the means of production.

By 1990 the government had virtually lost control over economic conditions. [[Government spending]] increased sharply as an increasing number of unprofitable enterprises required state support and consumer price subsidies continued. Tax revenues declined because republic and local governments withheld tax revenues from the central government under the growing spirit of regional autonomy. The elimination of central control over production decisions, especially in the consumer goods sector, led to the breakdown in traditional supply-demand relationships without contributing to the formation of new ones. Thus, instead of streamlining the system, Gorbachev's decentralisation caused new production bottlenecks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Comparison with China==
''Perestroika'' and [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]] have similar origins but very different effects on their respective countries' economies. Both efforts occurred in large socialist countries attempting to modernize their economies, but while China's GDP has grown consistently since the late 1980s (albeit from a much lower level), national GDP in the USSR and in many of its successor states fell precipitously throughout the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcselm.cfm?G=2001 |title=IMF World Economic Outlook Database April 2006 |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]] |date=2003-04-29 |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorbachev's reforms were [[gradualism|gradualist]] and maintained many of the macroeconomic aspects of the command economy (including price controls, inconvertibility of the ruble, exclusion of private property ownership, and the government monopoly over most means of production).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Reform was largely focused on industry and on cooperatives, and a limited role was given to the development of foreign investment and international trade. Factory managers were expected to meet state demands for goods, but to find their own funding. Perestroika reforms went far enough to create new bottlenecks in the Soviet economy but arguably did not go far enough to effectively streamline it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Chinese economic reform was, by contrast, a bottom-up attempt at reform, focusing on light industry and agriculture (namely allowing peasants to sell produce grown on private holdings at market prices).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Economic reforms were fostered through the development of "[[Special Economic Zone]]s", designed for export and to attract foreign investment, municipally managed [[Township and Village Enterprises]] and a "dual pricing" system leading to the steady phasing out of state-dictated prices.&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Shirk in ''The Political Logic of Economic Reform in China'', University of California, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1993. {{ISBN|0-520-07706-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Greater latitude was given to managers of state-owned factories, while capital was made available to them through a reformed banking system and through fiscal policies (in contrast to the fiscal anarchy and fall in revenue experienced by the Soviet government during ''perestroika''). Perestroika was expected to lead to results such as market pricing and privately sold produce, but the Union dissolved before advanced stages were reached.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Another fundamental difference is that where perestroika was accompanied by greater political freedoms under Gorbachev's [[glasnost]] policies, Chinese economic reform has been accompanied by continued [[authoritarianism|authoritarian rule]] and a [[Protest and dissent in China|suppression of political dissidents]], most notably at [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square]]. Gorbachev acknowledges this difference but has always maintained that it was unavoidable and that perestroika would have been doomed to defeat and [[revanchism]] by the [[nomenklatura]] without glasnost, because conditions in the Soviet Union were not identical to those in China.&lt;ref name="Gorbachev1996pp494-495"&gt;{{Citation |last=Gorbachev |first=Mikhail Sergeevich |year=1996 |title=Memoirs |publisher=Doubleday |pages=494–495 |isbn=9780385480192 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorbachev had lived through the era in which the attempted reforms by Khrushchev, limited as they were, were rolled back under Brezhnev and other pro-totalitarian conservatives, and he could clearly see that the same could happen again without glasnost to allow broad oppositional pressure against the nomenklatura. Gorbachev cited a line from a 1986 newspaper article that he felt encapsulated this reality: "The apparatus broke Khrushchev's neck and the same thing will happen now."&lt;ref name="Gorbachev1996p188"&gt;{{Citation |last=Gorbachev |first=Mikhail Sergeevich |year=1996 |title=Memoirs |publisher=Doubleday |page=188 |isbn=9780385480192 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another difference is that Soviet Union faced strong secession threats from its ethnic regions and a primacy challenge by the [[RSFSR]]. Gorbachev's extension of regional autonomy removed the suppression from existing ethnic-regional tension, while Deng's reforms did not alter the tight grip of the central government on any of their so-called autonomous regions. The Soviet Union's dual nature, part supranational union of republics and part unitary state, played a part in the difficulty of controlling the pace of restructuring, especially once the new Russian Communist Party was formed and posed a challenge to the primacy of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]]. Gorbachev described this process as a "[[parade of sovereignties]]" and identified it as the factor that most undermined the gradualism of restructuring and the preservation of the Soviet Union. This caused a situation in the USSR whose closest analog would be if English sovereignty undermined that of the United Kingdom at a time when the entire UK society and economy was under significant stress and reform, or if [[North China]] had a party and state emerge as a challenge to the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]] and PRC during Deng's reforms.

==Perestroika and glasnost==
One of the final important measures taken on the continuation of the movement was a report from the central committee meeting of the CPSU titled "On Reorganization and the Party's Personnel Policy".&lt;ref&gt;Gidadhubli, R. G. (1987, May 02). Perestroika and glasnost. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/4376986&lt;/ref&gt; This report was in such high demand in Prague and Berlin that many people could not get a copy. One effect was the sudden demand for Russian dictionaries in order to understand the content of Gorbachev's report. {{citation needed|reason=These two sentences need a reliable source|date=November 2018}}

== The role of the West in Perestroika ==
During the 1980s and 1990s the United States President [[George H. W. Bush]] pledged solidarity with Gorbachev, but never brought his administration into supporting Gorbachev's reform. In fact, "no bailout for Gorbachev" was a consistent policy line of the Bush Administration, further demonstrating the lack of true support from the West. President Bush had a financial policy to aid perestroika that was shaped by a minimalist approach, foreign-policy convictions that set Bush up against other U.S. internal affairs, and a frugal attitude, all influencing his unwillingness to aid Gorbachev. Other factors influenced the West's lack of aid as well like "the in-house Gorbi-skeptics" advocacy, the expert community's consensus about the undesirability of rushing U.S. aid to Gorbachev, and strong opposition to any bailout at many levels, including foreign-policy conservatives, the U.S. Congress, and the American public at large. The West seemed to miss an opportunity to help reform the Soviet regime into a more democracy-like society. The Soviets aided in the expansion of Western capitalism to allow for an inflow of Western investments, but the perestroika managers failed. President Bush had the opportunity to aid the Soviet Union in a chance to improve their government, like [[Harry S. Truman]] did for Western Europe. &lt;blockquote&gt;Early on, as perestroika was getting under way, I felt like the West might come along and find it a sensible thing to do—easing Russia's difficult transition from totalitarianism to democracy. What I had in mind in the Preface iv first place, was the participation [of the West] in conversion of defense industries, the modernization of light and food industries, and Russia's inclusion on an equal-member footing in the frameworks of the international economic relations ... [U]nlike some democrats, I did not expect "manna from Heaven," but counted on the Western statesmen to use their common sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=America, Russia, and the Cold War, 1945-2000|last=LaFeber|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;President George H. Bush  continued to dodge helping the Russians and the President of Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel, laid bare the linkage for the Americans in his address to a joint session of Congress on February 21, 1990: &lt;blockquote&gt;... I often hear the question: How can the United States of America help us today? My reply is as paradoxical as the whole of my life has been: You can help us most of all if you help the Soviet Union on its irreversible, but immensely complicated road to democracy. ...[T]he sooner, the more quickly, and the more peacefully the Soviet Union begins to move along the road toward genuine political pluralism, respect for the rights of nations to their own integrity and to a working—that is a market—economy, the better it will be, not just for Czechs and Slovaks, but for the whole world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the United States needed help with Germany's reunification, Gorbachev proved to be instrumental in bringing solutions to the "German problem" and Bush acknowledged that "Gorbachev was moving the USSR in the right direction". Bush, in his own words, even gave praise to Gorbachev "to salute the man" in acknowledgment of the Soviet leader's role as "the architect of perestroika ... [who had] conducted the affairs of the Soviet Union with great restraint as Poland and Czechoslovakia and GDR ... and other countries [that had] achieved their independence," and who was "under extraordinary pressure at home, particularly on the economy."

The '''Plasco Building''' ({{lang-fa|ساختمان پلاسکو|Sakhteman-e Pelasko}}) was a 17-story high-rise landmark building in [[Tehran]], the capital city of Iran. At the time of its construction in the 1960s it was the tallest building in Iran&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-collapse-kills-tehran-firefighters-battling-plasco-building-fire/|title=Collapse of burning building kills dozens of firefighters|publisher=CBS News|date=19 January 2017|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was considered an iconic part of the Tehran skyline.&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt; The building collapsed on 19 January 2017 during a [[skyscraper fire]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

== History ==
The Plasco building was built in 1962 by the prominent businessman [[Habib Elghanian]], during a decade of rapid growth in Iran. The building was named after his plastics company.&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt; At the time of its construction it was the tallest building in Iran,&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; and was considered an iconic landmark of the Tehran skyline, representing the drive for modernization under the rule of Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/world/middleeast/iran-tehran-building-collapse.html |title=At Least 20 Firefighters Killed in Tehran Building Collapse |first1=Thomas |last1 =Erdbrink |first2=Dan |last2=Bilefsky |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=19 January 2017 |accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt;

After the [[1979 Iranian revolution]], Habib Elghanian was executed by the new government, which seized the building and handed ownership of it to the state-controlled [[Mostazafan Foundation|Islamic Revolution Mostazafan Foundation]], tied to the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Iranian Revolutionary Guards]]. The Mostazafan Foundation operated the building until its collapse.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Iran Says Firefighters Killed in Collapse of Tehran High-Rise |agency=Associated Press |author=Amir Vahdat, Jon Gambrell |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-19/urgent-iranian-tv-high-rise-tower-on-fire-in-tehran-collapses |date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the fire, the Plasco building was used as a [[Mixed-use development|residential and commercial building]], with a major shopping center on its ground floor, a restaurant on its upper floor, and several clothing workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/tehran-s-iconic-plasco-building-collapses-after-fire-iran-state-n708721|title=A 17-story apartment block has reportedly collapsed in Tehran|publisher=NBC News|language=en|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 January 2017, a fire started on the ninth floor at around 07:50 local time (04:20 GMT).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/19/iran-shocked-by-deadly-fire-collapse-of-tehran-high-rise/|title=High-Rise Tower on Fire in Iranian Capital Collapses|last1=Vahdat|first1=Amir|last2=Gambrell|first2=John|work=Denver Post|language=en|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was occupied at the time by its residents, workers at the garment shops, and various tour groups that were being shown around the building.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-iran-high-rise-20170119-story.html |title=50 firefighters killed in Iran as burning high-rise collapses |first1=Shashank |last1=Bengali |first2=Ramin |last2= Mostaghim |date=19 January 2017 |accessdate=19 January 2017 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten fire brigades arrived to fight the blaze. The combined brigades had been trying to stop the fire for hours—while assuring that the building had been evacuated—when the building's north wall collapsed without warning, leading to the collapse of the rest of the building a few moments later.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38675628 |title=Tehran fire: Many feared dead as high-rise collapses |date=19 January 2017 |accessdate=19 January 2017 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse was captured on camera by Iran's state-run [[Press TV]], which was filming the firefighting efforts.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

Several firefighters were in the building when the north wall fell, some of whom safely escaped before the building completely collapsed. A number had been fighting the fire from elevated aerial platforms that toppled over during the collapse of the building. [[Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf]], the [[mayor of Tehran]], said he believed that no other civilians were within the building when it collapsed, but eyewitnesses reported seeing residents crossing police lines to try to enter the building and recover their possessions.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

Following the building's collapse, its owner, the Mostazafan Foundation, declined to make a public statement.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; Four days later, on 23 January 2017 the foundation apologized for their role in the possible failure in building's safety, but added that they are not a member of building's board who is responsible for the building's affairs. [[Mohammad Saeedikia]], CEO of Mostazafan Foundation also said that the organization is ready to rebuild the Plasco in two years.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In April 2017 the government issued a report on the collapse of the building which stated that the Mostazafan Foundation had ignored warnings given by the authorities.  The report also stated that government ministries had failed to enforce 22 national building regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/412459/Report-on-collapse-of-Plasco-building-released|title=Report on collapse of Plasco building released|date=8 April 2017|work=Tehran Times|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swansea Grand Theatre''' is a [[performing arts]] venue in the [[Swansea city centre|centre]] of [[Swansea]], [[Wales]]. The [[theatre]] stages [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[pantomime]]s and touring theatrical acts visiting Swansea. Swansea Grand Theatre was the base for the UK's only [[Russian ballet]] company, the Swansea Ballet Russe.&lt;ref name="Ballet Russe"&gt;[http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1806 City and County of Swansea - Swansea Ballet Russe]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The theatre opened in 1897. Erected on the site of the former 'Drill Hall' it was designed for proprietors H H Morell and F Mouillot by architect William Hope of Newcastle, built by D Jenkins and opened by Madame [[Adelina Patti]] - a locally resident operatic diva.

In 1968, the Swansea Grand was threatened with closure but, following a campaign led by its manager and artistic director John Chilvers, the theatre was saved.&lt;ref&gt;Vivyan Ellacott [http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/feature.php/20260/john-chilvers John Chilvers obituary] ''The Stage'' Features, 31 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swansea Corporation]] (City Council) leased the building in May 1969 and bought it outright in 1979. The theatre was then refurbished and updated between 1983 and 1987 at a cost of £6.5m. A further £1m was spent on an Arts Wing which opened in 1999 (opened by [[Catherine Zeta-Jones|Catherine Zeta Jones]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1830 City and County of Swansea - A brief history of Swansea's Grand Theatre] at [[City and County of Swansea Council|Swansea Council]] website&lt;/ref&gt; The City and County of Swansea continues to own, manage and fund the building today.

==Facilities==
Swansea Grand Theatre has a 1,014
-seat auditorium and variety of smaller studios and rooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1779 City and County of Swansea - Grand Theatre Conference Facilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218143125/http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1779 |date=2008-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arts Wing is the most recent development at the theatre, a space to host exhibitions, conferences and smaller-scale music and drama performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=2190 City and County of Swansea - Grand Theatre - The Arts Wing]&lt;/ref&gt; These include Lunchtime Theatre on the last Saturday of each month, presented by Fluellen Theatre Company, a regular [[burlesque]] night presented by The Blue Stocking Lounge, and a regular [[comedy]] club featuring acts on the comedy circuit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=12027 City and County of Swansea - Grand Theatre Comedy Club]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballet Russe and other organisations==
Since September 1999, the Ballet Russe, formerly known as Swansea's Pavlov Ballet, has been based at the Swansea Grand Theatre. The company, which started in [[Bristol]], is a group of young dancers, most whom trained in [[Russia]] at the [[Bolshoi Theatre|Bolshoi]] and [[Mariinsky Ballet|Kirov]] academies.&lt;ref name="Ballet Background"&gt;[http://www.balletrusse.com/ Background On The Ballet Russe Company]&lt;/ref&gt; They work as an ensemble under the artistic leadership of the Messerer family,&lt;ref name="Ballet Russe"/&gt; and are able to put on full-length performances of ''[[Giselle]]'', ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', ''[[Coppélia]]'', ''[[La Fille Mal Gardée]]'' and ''[[Swan Lake]]'', and also give gala performances including extracts from ''Bayadere'', ''Carnival of Venice'', ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'' and ''[[Le Corsaire]]''.&lt;ref name="Ballet Background"/&gt;

Swansea Grand Theatre is also home to the Sir [[Harry Secombe]] Trust Youth Theatre, Fluellen Theatre Company, the Swansea Grand Theatre School of Dance and Mellin Theatre Arts, which hold classes, performances and workshops at the venue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1795 City and County of Swansea - Sir Harry Secombe Trust Youth Theatre and the Swansea Grand Theatre School of Dance] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120805234725/http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1795 |date=2012-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louiseedwardsshoolofdance.com/about-us.php|title=Louise Edwards School of Dance|accessdate=23 December 2009}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fear of being buried alive''' is the [[fear]] of being [[premature burial|placed in a grave while still alive]] as a result of being incorrectly pronounced [[Death|dead]]. The abnormal, [[psychopathology|psychopathological]] version of this fear is referred to as '''taphophobia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] τάφος - ''taphos'', "grave, tomb"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dta%2Ffos1 τάφος],  Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and φόβος - ''phobos'', "fear"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfo%2Fbos φόβος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;), which is translated as "fear of graves".&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich H. "Taphophobia and resurrection mania", ''Schweizer Arkiv für Neurologie, Neurochirurgie und Psychiatrie''. 1977;120(2):195–203 {{PMID|905788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the advent of modern medicine, the fear was not entirely irrational. Throughout history, there have been numerous cases of people being buried alive by accident. In 1905, the English reformer [[William Tebb]] collected accounts of premature burial. He found 219 cases of near live burial, 149 actual live burials, 10 cases of live dissection and 2 cases of awakening while being embalmed.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Christine. ''The Corpse: A History''&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th century had seen the development of [[Artificial respiration|mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]] and crude [[defibrillation]] techniques to revive persons considered dead, and the [[Royal Humane Society]] had been formed as the Society for the Recovery of Persons Apparently Drowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|accessdate=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, an American funeral director, T. M. Montgomery, reported that "nearly 2% of those exhumed were no doubt victims of suspended animation",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/horrors/gruesome/buried.asp "Just Dying to Get Out"], from [[Snopes.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; although folklorist Paul Barber has argued that the incidence of burial alive has been overestimated, and that the normal effects of decomposition are mistaken for signs of life.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Paul. ''Vampires, Burial and Death: Folklore and Reality''. Yale University Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many [[urban legend]]s of people being accidentally buried alive. Legends included elements such as someone entering into the state of [[sopor (sleep)|sopor]] or [[coma]], only to wake up years later and die a horrible death. Other legends tell of coffins opened to find a corpse with a long beard or corpses with the hands raised and palms turned upward. Of note is a legend about the premature burial of Ann Hill Carter Lee, the wife of [[Henry Lee III]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/jarvis/jarvis81.html Robert E. Lee's Mother]&lt;/ref&gt;  On his deathbed in 1799, [[George Washington]] made his attendants promise not to bury him for two days.

Literature found fertile ground in exploring the natural fear of being buried alive. One of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s horror stories, "[[The Premature Burial]]", is about a person suffering from taphophobia. Other Poe stories about premature burial are "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]" and "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]"—and to a lesser extent, "[[The Black Cat (short story)|The Black Cat]]".

Fear of being buried alive was elaborated to the extent that those who could afford it would make all sorts of arrangements for the construction of a [[safety coffin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://p6.hostingprod.com/@www.kirchersociety.org/blog/?p=233 A Short History of Security Coffins] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927090943/http://p6.hostingprod.com/@www.kirchersociety.org/blog/?p=233 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure this would be avoided (e.g., glass lids for observation, ropes to bells for signaling, and breathing pipes for survival until rescued).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpmlegal.com/wcoffin.html Improved burial case]&lt;/ref&gt;

An urban legend states that the sayings "Saved by the bell" and "Dead ringer" are both derived from the notion of having a rope attached to a bell outside the coffin that could alert people that the recently buried person is not yet deceased; these theories have been proven a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilton|first=David|title=Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|pages=75–77|isbn=978-0-19-537557-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although greater public confidence in the medical profession and its ability to diagnose death accurately has seen a reduction in fear of premature burial after the early 20th century there have been periods of public alarm in recent decades after medical errors in diagnosing death were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bondeson |first1=Jan |title=Buried Alive: The Terrifying History of Our Most Primal Fear |date=17 March 2002 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=London |isbn=978-0393322224}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taphophobia may remain common in some parts of the world.  For example, a study of Pakistani women found severe taphophobia in one third of subjects with mental illness and a mild degree of this fear in half of the controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bajwa |first1=Munaza |title=Prevalence and factors associated with phobias among women |journal=Asean Journal of Psychiatry |date=2014 |volume=15 |issue=2 |page=140–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although rare in the developed world, a recent study reported three cases of taphophobia among older people in the west of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fanous |first1=S. |last2=O’Keeffe |first2=S.T. |title=Not yet dead and buried!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14628">'''The babysitter and the man upstairs''' — also known as '''the babysitter''' or '''the sitter''' — is an [[urban legend]] that dates back to the 1960s about a teenage girl [[babysitting]] children who receives telephone calls from a man who continually asks her to "check the children".&lt;ref name="Forman-Brunell"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/book?id=KnaKW5zvkUgC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=baby-sitter+man+upstairs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4WFwUvXqCMrpkAeIoIGoAQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAQ |title=Babysitter: An American History |first=Miriam |last=Forman-Brunell |page=133 |publisher=New York University Press |year=2009 |isbn=0-8147-2759-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic storyline has been adapted a number of times, including in ''[[Foster's Release]]'' (1971), ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (1974), ''[[Walter Hugo Khouri|O Anjo da Noite]]'' (1974), ''[[The Sitter (1977 film)|The Sitter]]'' (1977), ''[[When a Stranger Calls (1979 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]'' (1979), ''[[When a Stranger Calls Back]]'' (1993), ''[[When a Stranger Calls (2006 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]'' (2006) and ''[[Amusement (film)|Amusement]]'' (2008). (''The Sitter'', ''When a Stranger Calls'', and ''When a Stranger Calls Back'' are all the work of director [[Fred Walton (director)|Fred Walton]].)

It has also been covered in the television programs ''[[Freaky Stories]]'' and ''[[Mostly True Stories: Urban Legends Revealed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Urban legends |page=50 |author=Gillian Bennett, Paul Smith |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSq1AAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Contemporary legend |author=Gillian Bennett, Paul Smith |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zl39ezuo158C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The legend ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
A teenage girl is babysitting at night. The children have been put to bed upstairs and the babysitter is downstairs, watching TV. The phone rings; a man tells her to check on the children. The teenager dismisses the call and goes back to watching TV. The stranger calls back several times. Eventually the girl becomes worried and calls the police, who tell her they will trace the next call. After he calls again, the police call back, telling her that the call is coming from inside the house and tell her to get out now. She goes outside and the police meet her. They explain that the calls were coming from inside the house, and that the man was calling her after killing the children.

==The historical crime==
The crime on which this urban legend is based happened in 1950. On the evening of March 18, 1950, 13-year-old Janett Christman&lt;ref name=Columbia1&gt;{{cite web|title=Mueller v. Powell, 203 F. 2d 797 - Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit 1953|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=203+F2d+797+Mueller+v.+Powell&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=16134417045241941383&amp;scilh=0|website=Google Scholar|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was babysitting 3-year-old Gregory Romack at his home on West Boulevard and Stewart Road in [[Columbia, Missouri]]. Sometime after Christman put the toddler to bed and before his parents returned around 1:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., an intruder shattered a window and attacked her in the Romacks’ living room. Although a garden hose left outside was used to break the window, police said the furniture and light fixtures near the window were totally undisturbed, making it impossible for him to run into the darkness. that way. This indicated to investigators that the intruder attempted to make it look like the house had been broken into, when in reality, Christman probably opened the front door for someone she knew.&lt;ref name="Columbia4"&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of Violence: Janett Christman|url=http://archive.voxmagazine.com/stories/2011/05/12/history-violence-janett-christman/|website=Vox Magazine|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 10:35&amp;nbsp;p.m., Officer Roy McCowan received a jarring phone call. A girl was screaming hysterically on the other end, and McCowan heard the words “come quick!” The connection, however, broke off before the girl could identify herself. At that late hour, the test board at the telephone company was not staffed, and the call could not be traced. At about 1:35&amp;nbsp;a.m., the Romacks returned home to find the front Venetian blinds open and the porch light illuminated. Both the front and back doors were unlocked, and a side window was broken open. Christman lay in a pool of blood on a shag carpet by the family piano.&lt;ref name=Columbia3&gt;{{cite web|title=Who killed Janett Christman?|url=http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/perspectives/who-killed-janett-christman/article_9b21294b-9b76-5d00-9bc0-ee43c61ac54e.html|website=Columbia Daily Tribune|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the attack, she was hit on the head with a blunt weapon, raped and strangled with an iron cord. Several small puncture wounds on her head were consistent with that of a [[mechanical pencil]] — an item often carried by a close friend of the Romacks, Robert Mueller. He had met Christman several times and, according to court documents, “expressed admiration for Christman’s figure and her mature development, and expressed the opinion that she was a virgin.” Mrs. Romack told police she thought Mueller had made unwelcome advances toward Christman in the past.&lt;ref name="Columbia4"/&gt;

The prime suspect, 27-year-old Robert Mueller, was never charged, passed a [[Lie detection|lie detector test]] and eventually sued the sheriff and others for holding him illegally.&lt;ref name=Columbia5&gt;{{cite web|title=Unsolved murder brought back to spotlight|url=http://www.columbiatribune.com/8a78930e-08fa-11e3-9c17-10604b9f6eda.html|website=Columbia Daily Tribune|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crime remains unsolved.

==Variations==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2012}}
{{prose|date=March 2012}}
*In some tellings,&lt;ref name="Mikkelson2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/statue.asp|title=Statue|publisher=[[Snopes.com|Urban Legends Reference Pages]]|accessdate=28 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the babysitter does not receive any phone calls but is disturbed by a hideous clown-doll (sometimes it is an angel-doll). During the night, the babysitter repeatedly leaves the room and returns, and the clown always seems to be in a different position than before. The babysitter calls her employers asking for their permission to remove the doll from the bedroom, and the mother tells her they do not have a clown-doll. This version has made its way into the annals of internet "[[creepypasta]]."  This is most likely a version inspired by the movie ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]''. The film ''[[Amusement (film)|Amusement]]'' also includes a babysitter troubled by a sinister clown-doll.
*The number of children varies in different versions; sometimes one, other times, two or three. Also the children rarely survive in the story, sometimes having been murdered by the man before he called the babysitter.
*Sometimes in the story, the killer gives a certain time that he will kill the children and when he will come for the sitter (usually 10:30 pm is the given time).
*Often when the killer makes the phone call, he asks the sitter if she is "upstairs with the children".
*Sometimes the killer doesn't say anything but makes disturbing noises. And when the operator tells the babysitter that the calls are coming from upstairs, the line goes dead. The operator then tries calling the babysitter back to see if everything is alright, only to hear the same disturbing noises on the line.
*Sometimes the killer is described as having a weapon, like an axe or a sharp knife, or the killer is described as being covered in blood. In darker versions, he tears the children apart with his bare hands, such as in the film ''[[When a Stranger Calls (1979 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]''.
*Other similar legends feature the babysitter herself as the threat to the children.
*Other versions describe the sitter as having a [[Dissociative identity disorder|split or multiple personality]]. With at least one of these personalities being a threatening and dangerous one.
*In several semi-related variations, the babysitter goes upstairs to check on the children only to run away upon seeing a man's face in the window. Later, when the parents and police arrive, the babysitter mentions the window incident, the parents/the police however say that it is not a window, only a mirror, meaning the man was behind her.
*In lighter versions of the story, the calls turn out to be a prank by the children using a tape recorder of an adult voice (usually a recording of their father's voice).
*In lighter versions, the children are not killed. They are instead locked up in a closet or trunk, or tied up or threatened by the killer to be silent. This variant is used in the 2006 version of ''When a Stranger Calls''.
*In some versions of the story the police arrive just in time to save the children, but in others they are too late.
*There have also been versions where the killer gets away, and the children (and sometimes the sitter) are kidnapped and are never seen again such as in ''[[When a Stranger Calls Back]]''.
*In most versions, the caller asks the sitter "have you checked the children?" at least three times.
*In one version, the story cuts to several years later. The babysitter is now married with her own children, and she is out for dinner with her husband, having hired a babysitter. During the meal in the restaurant, the waiter advises that there is a phone call for her which turns out to be from the same caller who terrorized her years before. This element is used in ''[[When a Stranger Calls (1979 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]'' (1979).
*In about every variation of this tale, the sitter is told that the calls are coming from inside the house.
*In a different variation, the babysitter hides the children (usually in a laundry basket or an empty trunk) after she finds out the phone calls are coming from the house, only to be confronted by the killer soon after. He murders the babysitter and finds the children, who hug him lovingly when they discover he is, in fact, their brother. The parents come home, overjoyed to see their son come home from the ''bad place'' (possibly referring to an asylum or a prison) and the killer explains how he found the ''gift'' (the babysitter) waiting for him, suggesting that the whole family is [[Psychosis|psychotic]].
*Some renditions of the story only start out with a single parent leaving the children with the sitter only to have the other parent (who often has been restricted by court officials) breaking in to either see or take the children.
*A version appears in one of [[Alvin Schwartz (children's author)|Alvin Schwartz]]'s ''[[Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark]]'' books.  In this version, the sitter is with the children in the TV room and keeps getting calls from someone laughingly saying "pretty soon now".  She has the police trace the call, and they tell her that the man is inside the house, at which point he reveals himself.  This version ends with the sitter and children escaping and the police arresting the man.
*A lighter and slightly humorous variation ends with neither the deaths of the babysitter nor the children, but simple miscommunication on the babysitter's part about a man called "The Viper" calling constantly to announce his arrival once an hour, eventually for the babysitter to face her assassin face-to-face at the door after hearing a knock; a little man with a bucket and a cloth comes in and announces in some degree, "[[Window cleaner|I am the viper. I vish to vash and vipe the vindows.]]", and is a [[Central Europe]]an man with an [[Hypercorrection#V .2F W|accent]].
*Other variations also have one of the children (usually a young boy) being babysat playing a prank on the babysitter after the call is traced and coming from inside the house.
*There is also a version in which the babysitter calls the parents to ask if she can watch the TV in their room. After the father gives her permission she asks if she can cover up the statue of the angel they have in the garden because she is scared of it. The father then says to her to take the kids, call the police and leave the house immediately, as they do not have a statue in the garden. When the police arrive, the girl and the children are dead and the angel is gone.
*In another variation, the babysitter is watching the television with the children. But the phone begins to ring. Thinking it's the parents checking up on them, the babysitter answers it. Only to hear a creepy man's voice saying that he'll be with them soon. Then at random times throughout the evening, the caller keeps calling them and keeps stating that he'll be with them within one hour, then forty-five minutes, then thirty minutes, and so on. The babysitter then calls the operator and they put a trace on the caller if he calls again. The caller does call again, saying that he'll be with them very soon. The babysitter then contacts the operator who says that the calls are coming from upstairs and that the babysitter must get the children out of the house at once and they'll call the police. Just after the operator says this, the babysitter and the children hear a door open and slam shut upstairs and hurried footsteps heading down the stairs and towards the door to the room where they are. This story has two endings. In one the babysitter and the children managed to get out safely while the caller is captured and taken away by the police. While in the second version, the police arrive to find everyone killed brutally and the caller had disappeared into the night. There is also another version where the caller turns out to be an older sibling of the children who after going out for the night, had sneaked back into the house and was playing a prank on the babysitter. But they end up getting into serious trouble by the police because of the prank.

'''''Tom &amp; Viv''''' is a play written by English playwright [[Michael Hastings (playwright)|Michael Hastings]]. The play is based on the real life of [[T. S. Eliot]] and his wife [[Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/11/theater/theater-in-london-t-s-eliot-becomes-a-figure-of-controversy.html?pagewanted=all Figure of Controversy] accessed 11/4/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

To write the play,  Hastings spent many months conducting interviews with friends and family of the Eliot's that were still alive and read through the letters left behind from the family. The play received some controversy over painting T.S. Eliot in a less than flattering light over his treatment of his wife while she was in poor health. Hastings died in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/theater/michael-hastings-british-playwright-dies-at-74.html Hastings obituary] accessed 10/4/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The play begins with the beginning of the courtship between T.S. Eliot and Vivienne Haigh-Wood in 1914 and ends with their separation in 1933 and Vivienne's gradual mental health decline until her death in 1947. The play also follows the early career of T.S. Eliot, the death of Vivienne's father, and how her mother Rose dealt with her daughter's failing marriage and mental health.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6504">'''''Trojan.Win32.[[Domain Name Server|DNS]]Changer''''' (or '''''Trojan:Win32/[[Domain Name Server|Dns]]changer''''' (''Microsoft Malware Protection Center'')) is the definition of multiple [[AV-Labs]], of a ([[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]) [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]]. Due to [[McAfee Labs]], this [[Malware]] variant was detected on April 19, 2009, though ''[[Microsoft|Microsoft Malware Protection Center]]'' knew about this threat since December 8, 2006.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://home.mcafee.com/virusInfo/VirusProfile.aspx?key=154863 DNSChanger | Virus Profile &amp; Definition | McAfee Inc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?name=trojan:win32/dnschanger Trojan:Win32/Dnschanger&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behaviour ==
DNS changer Trojans are dropped onto systems by other malware such as ''TDSS'' or [[Koobface]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/125/how-dns-changer-trojans-direct-users-to-threats How DNS Changer Trojans Direct Users to Threats - Threat Encyclopedia - Trend Micro USA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The DNS-Changer-Trojan is a malicious [[.exe]] file, but is unable to spread of its own accord. It may therefore perform several actions of an [[Adversary (cryptography)|attacker]]'s choice on an compromised computer, such as changing the ''Domain&amp;nbsp;Name&amp;nbsp;Server'' (''DNS'') settings in order to divert traffic to unsolicited, and potentially illegal and/or malicious domains.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The ''Win32.DNSChanger'' is used by [[organized crime syndicate]]s to maintain [[Click fraud|Click-Fraud]]. In that moment the (unaware) user's browsing activity is secretly manipulated (such as altering the user who clicks on a (for him seemingly) legitimate link to then be forwarded to another offered site), so that the [[attacker]]s can [[Generator (mathematics)|generate]] [[revenue]]s from [[pay-per-click]] [[online advertising]] [[Get-rich-quick scheme|scheme]]s. Mostly this trojan is usually an extremely small file (+/- 1.5 kilobytes) that is designed to change the 'NameServer' [[Registry key]] value to a custom [[IP address]] or link. This called IP address is [[encrypted]] in the body of a trojan. As a result of this change, a victim's Device will contact the newly assigned ''DNS''-server to resolve names of different [[webserver]]s, sometimes randomly.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

; [[Trend Micro|TrendMicro systems]] described following behaviors of ''Win32.DNSChanger''.
*''Steering unknowing users to bad sites'': These sites can be phishing pages that spoof well-known sites in order to trick users into handing out sensitive information. A user who wants to visit the [[iTunes]] site, for instance, is instead unknowingly redirected to a rogue site.
*''Replacing ads on legitimate sites'': Visiting certain sites can serve users with infected systems a different set of ads from those whose systems are not infected.
*''Controlling and redirecting network traffic'': Users of infected systems may not be granted access to download important OS and software updates from vendors like Microsoft and from their respective security vendors.
*''Pushing additional malware'': Infected systems are more prone to other malware infections (e.g., FAKEAV infection).&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

== Other Aliases ==
* ''Win32:KdCrypt[Cryp]'' ([[Avast]])
* ''TR/Vundo.Gen'' ([[Avira]])
* ''MemScan:Trojan.DNSChanger'' ([[Bitdefender Labs]])

''[[F-Secure]]'' received samples of a variant that were named ''PayPal-2.5.200-MSWin32-x86-2005.exe''.

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 463''', adopted on 2 February 1980, after considering the latest developments in [[Southern Rhodesia]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 460|Resolution 460]] (1979) in which it was noted that an agreement had produced a Constitution for a free and independent [[Zimbabwe]] and majority rule, the Council called on all parties to comply with the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] and the administering power, the United Kingdom, to fully implement the agreement.  

Resolution 463 called upon the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] to ensure that South African forces would be withdrawn, regular or [[mercenary]], out of the country. It also requested that United Kingdom implement steps including:

: (a) the speedy return of Zimbabwean exiles and refugees in accordance with the agreement;
: (b) the release of [[political prisoner]]s;
: (c) the confinement of the Rhodesian and auxiliary forces to their bases;
: (d) the according of equal treatment of all parties;
: (e) the rescindment of all emergency measures and laws inconsistent with the conduct of free and fair elections.

The resolution also went on to call for the release of South African political prisoners, including "freedom fighters" - presumably [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] members detained by the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]] - and to ensure safe passage to a country of their choice. It also condemned South Africa for its interference in Southern Rhodesia.

While noting that it would keep the situation under review until the full independence of Zimbabwe, the Council adopted the resolution by 14 votes to none, while the United Kingdom did not participate in the vote.

'''Upstream collection''' is a term used by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) of the [[United States]] for intercepting telephone and Internet traffic from the [[Internet backbone]], i.e. major Internet cables and switches, both domestic and foreign. Besides the Upstream collection, NSA also gathers information from Internet communications through arrangements with Internet companies under the program codenamed [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]].&lt;ref name=fisc2011 /&gt; Both the Upstream programs and PRISM are part of the [[Special Source Operations]] (SSO) division, which is responsible for collection in cooperation with corporate partners.

One of the slides of a presentation about the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]]-program describes Upstream as "collection of communications on fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past" and says the Upstream collection is conducted under the following four major surveillance programs:&lt;ref name&gt;The Washington Post, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/the-nsa-slide-you-havent-seen/2013/07/10/32801426-e8e6-11e2-aa9f-c03a72e2d342_story.html The NSA slide you haven’t seen], July 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fairview (surveillance program)|FAIRVIEW]]
* [[Blarney (code name)|BLARNEY]]
* [[STORMBREW]]
* [[OAKSTAR]]

The FAIRVIEW, BLARNEY and STORMBREW programs are for collecting data at facilities in the United States, whereas OAKSTAR is an umbrella for eight different programs used for collection outside the US. Under all four programs, the collection takes place in cooperation with commercial telecommunication companies, both inside and outside the US.&lt;ref name=slides&gt;Top Level Telecommunications, [http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2014/01/slides-about-nsas-upstream-collection.html Slides about NSA's Upstream collection], January 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Upstream collection programs allow access to very high volumes of data. According to one anonymous official speaking to a Wall Street Journal reporter, first, a pre-selection is done by the telecommunication providers themselves, who select traffic (including the text of emails and the audio of telephone calls) that most likely contains foreign communications. Then the data is passed on to the NSA, where a second selection is made by briefly copying the traffic and filtering it by using so-called "strong selectors" like [[phone number]]s, [[e-mail]] or [[IP address]]es of people and organizations in which NSA is interested.&lt;ref name="wsj2013"&gt;Siobhan Gorman and Jennifer Valentino-DeVries, [http://www.matthewaid.com/post/58904880659/nsa-surveillance-programs-cover-75-of-internet-traffic NSA Surveillance Programs Cover 75% of Internet Traffic Transiting U.S.], Wall Street Journal, August 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], a former high-ranking NSA official who is now a whistleblower, publicly maintains that the NSA seeks to "collect it all" with minimal filtering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whittaker|first1=Zack|title=NSA is so overwhelmed with data, it's no longer effective, says whistleblower|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/nsa-whistleblower-overwhelmed-with-data-ineffective/|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet data collected by Upstream programs can be processed and searched through the [[XKeyscore|XKEYSCORE]] indexing and analysing system.

According to former and current US government officials, there are more than a dozen major US based Internet switching stations where this kind of filtering takes place, which is not only near the sites where the main [[Submarine communications cable|undersea Internet cables]] enter the US.&lt;ref name="wsj2013" /&gt; An actual example of a facility where NSA taps Internet backbone cables is [[Room 641A]] in the San Francisco switching station of AT&amp;T, which was revealed in 2006. One of the devices used to filter the Internet traffic is the Semantic Traffic Analyzer or STA 6400 made by Boeing subsidiary [[Narus (company)|Narus]].

For collection of data from Internet cables and switches outside the United States, the NSA also has secret agreements with foreign Internet providers, especially in Europe and the Middle East. The costs for this cooperation made by these companies are paid by NSA under its Corporate Partner Access program, just like the expenses of the American telecommunication companies. The total costs for this program were estimated at 278 million US dollar for the fiscal year 2013.&lt;ref name="wsj2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Top Level Telecommunications, [http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2013/08/nsa-has-also-arrangements-with-foreign.html NSA also has arrangements with foreign internet providers], August 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Upstream collection is conducted under four different legal authorizations: 
* [[Executive Order 12333|EO 12333]]
* [[Transit authority (NSA)|Transit]]
* [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]]
* [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|FAA]]

In a [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISC) order from October 3, 2011, it was said that the Upstream collection accounts for approximately 9% of the total number of 250 million Internet communications which NSA collects under the authority of section 702 FAA every year. During the first half of 2011, NSA acquired some 13.25 million Internet communications through Upstream collection. Although this is a relatively small amount, the order says Upstream collection is significant because it contains certain types of valuable foreign intelligence information, it still involves the collection of millions of Internet communications each year, and it is impossible for NSA to exclude domestic communications being collected due to technical difficulties.&lt;ref name=fisc2011&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/fisc_opinion_10.3.2011.pdf Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order], October 3, 2011, p. 29-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the conflict that was referred to as the World War before the start of the second war|World War I}}
{{War}}
A '''world war''' is a large-scale [[war]] which affects the whole world directly or indirectly. World wars span multiple countries on multiple [[continents]] or just two countries, with battles fought in many [[theater (warfare)|theaters]]. While a variety of global conflicts have been subjectively deemed "world wars", such as the [[Cold War]] and the [[War on Terror]], the term is widely and usually accepted only as it is retrospectively applied to two major international conflicts that occurred during the 20th century: [[World War I]] (1914–1918) and [[World War II]] (1939–1945).

==Origin of the term==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cited the first known usage in the [[English language]] to a [[Scotland|Scottish]] newspaper: the ''People's Journal'' in 1848: "A war among the great powers is now necessarily a world-war." The term "world war" had been used in 1850 by [[Karl Marx]] and his associate, [[Friedrich Engels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1887/12/15.htm|title=Introduction to Borkheim|last=Engels |first=Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''The Class Struggles in France''. [[Rasmus B. Anderson]] in 1889 described an episode in [[Teutonic mythology]] as a “world war” (Swedish: ''världskrig''), justifying this description by a line in an [[Old Norse]] epic poem, "[[Völuspá]]: folcvig fyrst i heimi" ("The first great war in the world".)&lt;ref&gt;[[Rasmus Björn Anderson]] (translator: [[Viktor Rydberg]]), ''Teutonic Mythology'', vol. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-uJRw32enFQC&amp;pg=PT237 p. 139], London: S. Sonnenschein &amp; Co., 1889 {{OCLC|626839}}.&lt;/ref&gt; German writer August Wilhelm Otto Niemann had used the term "world war" in the title of his anti-British novel, ''Der Weltkrieg: Deutsche Träume'' (''The World War: German Dreams'') in 1904, published in English as ''The Coming Conquest of England''.

In English, the term "First World War" had been used by [[Charles à Court Repington]], as a title for his memoirs (published in 1920); he had noted his discussion on the matter with a Major Johnstone of [[Harvard University]] in his diary entry of September 10, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qi.com/infocloud/the-first-world-war The First World War] Quite Interesting Ltd. Encyclopedia. Downloaded Feb. 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "World War I" was coined by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine on page 28b of its June 12, 1939 issue. In the same article, on page 32, the term "World War II" was first used speculatively to describe the upcoming war. The first use for the actual war came in its issue of September 11, 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://time.com/3195322/world-war-grey-friday/ |title=Grey Friday: TIME Reports on World War II Beginning |work=TIME |date=September 11, 1939 |accessdate=20 October 2014 |quote=World War II began last week at 5:20 a. m. (Polish time) Friday, September 1, when a German bombing plane dropped a projectile on Puck, fishing village and air base in the armpit of the Hel Peninsula.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One week earlier, on September 4, the day after France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany, the Danish newspaper ''[[Kristeligt Dagblad]]'' used the term on its front page, saying "The Second World War broke out yesterday at 11 a.m."&lt;ref&gt;"Den anden Verdenskrig udbrød i Gaar Middags Kl. 11", ''Kristeligt Dagblad'', September 4, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Speculative fiction]] authors had been noting the concept of a Second World War in 1919 and 1920, when [[Milo Hastings]] wrote his [[dystopian]] novel, ''City of Endless Night''.
Other languages have also adopted the "world war" terminology, for example; in [[French language|French]]: "world war" is translated as ''guerre mondiale'', in [[German language|German]]: ''Weltkrieg'' (which, prior to the war, had been used in the more abstract meaning of a global conflict), in [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''guerra mondiale'', in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''guerra mundial'', in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''verdenskrig'', and in [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''мировая война'' (''mirovaya voyna''.)

==First World War==
{{main|World War I}}
It occurred from 1914 to 1918 and in terms of human [[history of technology|technological history]], the scale of World War I was enabled by the technological advances of the [[second industrial revolution]] and the resulting [[globalization]] that allowed global power projection and [[mass production]] of military hardware. Wars on such a scale have not been repeated since the onset of the [[Atomic Age]] and the resulting danger of [[mutually-assured destruction]]. It had been recognized that the complex system of opposing alliances (the [[German Empire|German]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Empires against the [[British Empire|British]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]], and [[French colonial empire|French]] Empires) was likely to lead to a worldwide conflict if a war broke out. Due to this fact, a very minute conflict between two countries had the potential to set off a [[domino effect]] of alliances, triggering a world war. The fact that the powers involved had large overseas empires virtually guaranteed that such a war would be worldwide, as the colonies' resources would be a crucial strategic factor. The same strategic considerations also ensured that the combatants would strike at each other's colonies, thus spreading the wars far more widely than those of [[pre-Columbian]] times.

[[War crimes]] were perpetrated in World War I. [[chemical weapons in World War I|Chemical weapons]] were used in the First World War despite the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] having outlawed the use of such weapons in warfare. The Ottoman Empire was responsible for the [[Armenian genocide]], the death of over one million Armenians during the First World War.

==Second World War==
{{main|World War II}}{{Refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
The Second World War occurred from 1939 to 1945 and is the only conflict in which [[atomic bombs]] have been used. [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], in [[Japanese Empire|Japan]], were [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|devastated]] by atomic bombs dropped by the United States. [[Nazi Germany]] was responsible for [[genocides]], most notably [[the Holocaust]], the killing of six million [[Jews]]. The [[United States]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Canada]] deported and [[interned]] minority groups within their own borders, and largely because of the conflict, many ethnic [[Germans]] were later expelled from [[Eastern Europe]]. Japan was responsible for attacking [[neutrality (international relations)|neutral nations]] without a [[declaration of war]], such as the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]]. It is also known for its brutal treatment and killing of Allied [[prisoners of war]] and the inhabitants of [[Asia]]. It also used Asians as [[forced labor]]ers and was responsible for the [[Nanking massacre]] where 250,000 civilians in the city were brutally murdered by Japanese troops. [[Non-combatants]] suffered at least as badly as or worse than [[combatants]], and the distinction between combatants and non-combatants was often blurred by belligerents of [[total war]] in both conflicts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The outcome of World War II had a profound effect on the course of world history. The old European empires either collapsed or were dismantled as a direct result of the wars' crushing costs and, in some cases, their fall was due to the defeat of imperial powers. The United States became firmly established as the dominant global superpower, along with its ideological foe, the Soviet Union, in close competition. The two superpowers exerted political influence over most of the world's [[nation-states]] for decades after the end of the Second World War. The modern international security, economic, and diplomatic system was created in the aftermath of the wars.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Institutions such as the [[United Nations]] were established to collectivize international affairs, with the explicit goal of preventing another outbreak of general war. The wars had also greatly changed the course of daily life. Technologies developed during wartime had a profound effect on peacetime life as well, such as by advances in [[jet aircraft]], [[penicillin]], [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]], and [[electronic computers]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Third World War==
{{main article|World War III}}
Since the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] during the Second World War, there has been a widespread and prolonged fear of a potential Third World War between nuclear-armed powers. The Third World War is generally considered a successor to the Second World War and is often suggested to become a [[nuclear war]], devastating in nature and likely much more violent than the First World War and the Second World War combined; in 1947, [[Albert Einstein]] commented that "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Alice | last = Calaprice | title = The new quotable Einstein | page = 173 | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2005 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; | isbn = 978-0-691-12075-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7406337/ |title=The culture of Einstein|publisher=MSNBC |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been anticipated and planned for by military and civil authorities and has been [[World War III in popular culture|explored in fiction]] in many countries. Concepts have ranged from purely-conventional scenarios, to limited use of nuclear weapons, to the complete destruction of the planet's surface.

Among these are former American, French, and Mexican government officials, military leaders, politicians, and authors: Despite their efforts, none of these wars are commonly deemed world wars.

Wars described by some historians as "World War Zero" include the [[Seven Years' War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/07/01/why-the-first-world-war-wasnt-really|title=Why the first world war wasn't really|journal=The Economist|date=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the onset of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2087924-world-war-zero-brought-down-mystery-civilisation-of-sea-people/|title=World War Zero brought down mystery civilisation of 'sea people'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, few serious students of the subject would put the hemispheric figure at less than 75,000,000 to 100,000,000 (with approximately 8,000,000 to 12,000,000 north of Mexico).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
