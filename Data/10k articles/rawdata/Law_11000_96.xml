[[File:Rodoljub Šabić.jpg|thumb|Rodoljub Šabić, Commissioner for Information and protection of personal data]]
'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Serbia]], access to public information is guaranteed in the Constitution and protected by the Law on free Access to Information of Public Importance adopted in 2003 and amended in 2007 and 2009. 
The '''scope of the right''' entails that everyone in Serbia has the right to access to information of public importance and to be informed whether public authorities hold specific information, whether such information is already accessible, and to obtain a copy of the requested information.&lt;ref name="Serbia Commissioner for Information"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poverenik.rs/en/contents-of-the-right.html| title= Contents of the right regarding access to information of public importance |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= 17 February 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and Protection of personal data is the authority entitled by law to monitor the respect of obligations entailed by this Law.

==Legal framework==
Serbia is considered among the countries with the best regulatory framework regarding access to information of public relevance: the Global Right to Information Rating, compiled by NGOs AccessInfo and Centre for Law and Democracy, ranks the country in the second position in its global ranking assessing the quality of legislative frameworks regulating FOI across the world.&lt;ref name="RTI Rating"&gt;{{cite web |date=2016 |title=Global Right to Information Rating |url=http://www.rti-rating.org/view_country/?country_name=Serbia |access-date= 17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right of access to public information is defined in Article 51 of the [[Constitution of Serbia]], which establishes the right of everybody to be informed about issues of public importance and the deriving obligation of state bodies and public organizations to guarantee the access to such information.&lt;ref name= "Serbian Constitution"&gt;{{cite constitution |article= 51 |section= II |country= Serbia |language= en |ratified=2006 |url=http://www.srbija.gov.rs/cinjenice_o_srbiji/ustav.php?change_lang=en |accessdate=17 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to access to information of public relevance is translated into national law by the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance adopted in 2003 and amended in 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poverenik.rs/en/pravni-okvir-pi/laws-pi/881-zakon-o-slobodnom-pristupu-informacijama-od-javnog-znacaja-preciscen-tekst-sl-glasnik-rs-12004-5407-10409-i-3610.html | title=Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance |access-date= 17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of the law is valued positively especially inasmuch as it extends the right to access to information '''to all natural person''', notwithstanding their citizenship, temporary or permanent residence in the country.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;

Moreover, the right to access information applies to the executive, legislative and judicial bodies, State-owned enterprises, as well as other public authorities and private bodies that perform a public function or that receive significant public funding are also obliged to disclose information of public relevance (Art. 3).&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;

Requests should be lodged in written form, with no need for the applicant to specify the reason for the request.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;
The public authority shall reply without delay and within 15 days at the latest. If the requested information entails consequences for the protection of a person's life or freedom, public health and the environment, the time span at the disposal of authorities is reduced to 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt; In cases in which the document contains information that the public has no legitimate interest to know, the applicant has the right to access to other parts of the documents.

Limitations to the right to access to information are defined in Article 9 of the Law, establishing that legitimate limitation may derive if the requested information exposes to risk the life, health, safety or another vital interest of a person; if it obstacles the work of the judiciary; if it threatens national defense, national and public safety, international relations or the government's ability to manage the national economic processes. Finally, classified information are excluded from the right.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;

The authority in charge of monitoring the respect of the Law is the '''Commissioner for Information of Public Importance'''. The Commissioner is an independent, second-level appeal instance: if a public authority does not respond to the request within the deadline, the applicant may lodge a complaint with the Commissioner, except in cases prescribed by this Law (Art.16).&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;

The Commissioner is entitled by Law to issue decisions on disputed cases, and his/her decisions should be enforced by the Government of the Republic of Serbia if necessary (Art 28).&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt; The Commissioner is appointed by the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia on proposal of the Committee of the National Assembly responsible for information. The position of the Commissioner for Information has been held since 2004 by Rodoljub Šabić, who was appointed for an initial 7-years term and then re-elected in 2011.

Aside from examining individual complaints related to violations of the right to free access to information, the Commissioner also addresses citizens’ requests asking how to exercise their right to information, provides to state authorities opinions about the implementation of the law, trainings for law implementation and takes part in activities related to the EU accession process.

It has been noted that a significant '''limitation of the right''' set forth in the Constitution is due to the restrictions applied to the admissibility of complaints against first instance decisions: a complaint is not admissible if “lodged against decisions of the National Assembly, the President of the Republic, the Government of the Republic of Serbia, the Supreme Court of Serbia, the Constitutional Court and the Republic Public Prosecutor” (Art. 22).&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedominfo.org/2004/11/serbian-parliament-adopts-access-law/ FreedomInfo.org]{{Retrieved|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

Since the adoption of the Law on Access to Information in 2004, a significant increase in the number of requests has been registered by the entitled Commissioner, pointing to the positive fact that the right is increasing being used by citizens and media professionals in Serbia. At the same time, the increasing number of complaints filed to the Commissioner demonstrates the reluctancy by authorities to timely and fully comply with the obligation established by the Law on access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Serbia/Serbia-the-hard-fight-for-information-177372 |title=Serbia: the hard fight for information |last=Maja|first=Poznatov |date=13 February 2017 |website=balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Beta / Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa |access-date=24 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its annual report for 2015, the Commissioner for Information notes some limitation to the effective implementation of the law. These have to do, according to the Commissioner, particularly with insufficient accountability for violations of the Law and inefficient mechanisms of enforcement of the Commissioner’s decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poverenik.rs/images/stories/dokumentacija-nova/izvestajiPoverenika/2015/IZVESTAJ2015/engrezime.pdf |title= Summary of the report on the implementation of the law on Free Access to Information|last=Commissioner for Information in Serbia |date=2016 |access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the implementation of the Law on Access to Information in Serbia and its impact on the exercise of journalism, Freedom House has noted in 2016 that “Despite the existence of the 2004 Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance, authorities frequently obstruct journalists’ efforts to obtain public information”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/serbia |title= Freedom of the press in Serbia|last=Freedom House |date=2016 |access-date=19 February 2017|quote=“Despite the existence of the 2004 Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance, authorities frequently obstruct journalists’ efforts to obtain public information”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern over implementation, alignment with European standards, endowment of resources to the Commissioner for Information and enforcement of his decisions is highlighted also by the [[European Union]] in its annual report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2016/20161109_report_serbia.pdf |title= EU Serbia Progress Report 2016| date=2016 |access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth Initiative for Human Rights v. Serbia===
A landmark case by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] related to the right to access to information in Serbia. 
In 2006, the Belgrade-based NGO [[Youth Initiative for Human Rights]] (YIHR) filed a request to the Serbian [[Security Intelligence Agency]] demanding information concerning the use of electronic surveillance measures by that agency in 2005. 
The Agency denied access to the requested information twice, first on grounds of secrecy and then, after a binding decision by the Commissioner for Information stating that the information should be made public, by declaring that it did not hold the requested information.&lt;ref name=Voohroof&gt;{{cite web| url=https://strasbourgobservers.com/2013/07/08/article-10-of-the-convention-includes-the-right-of-access-to-data-held-by-intelligence-agency/#more-2125 |title=Article 10 of the Convention includes the right of access to data held by an intelligence agency |last=Voorhoof |first=Dirk |date=8 July 2013 |website=Strasbourg Observer |access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YIHR appealed to the European Court of Human Rights under [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 6]] and [[Article_10_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights|Article 10]] of the Convention.
In June 2013, the verdict of the ECtHR defined “unpersuasive” the argument used by the Agency according to which it did not hold the information requested and found that the restrictions imposed by the Serbian intelligence agency were not justified by domestic law and hence constituted a violation of article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref name=Voohroof/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1890">An '''ambush defence''' is one in which defence evidence - notably from [[expert witness]]es - has not been adduced in advance to the prosecuting authorities, leading to their inability to rebut it. The term is used in [[United Kingdom]] jurisprudence. Since 1987, the possibility of the ambush defence has been much reduced by The Crown Court (Advance Notice of Expert Evidence) Rules 1987, made under section 81 of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], which in essence require the defence to provide the prosecution with copies of expert witness reports in sufficient time for the prosecution to consider the nature of and if necessary prepare rebuttal evidence opposing the report.

An example of the ambush defence is found in a paper given by [[John Milford QC|Judge John Milford QC]] at a 1994 Joint Conference entitled "Beyond reasonable doubt" organised by the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] and the [[Expert Witness Institute]].  Discussing the trial of a train driver following the [[Rail accidents at Morpeth#1984 derailment|1984 derailment]] of a train near [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]] he wrote:

:The case of R v Allen 1985 illustrates the position which applied hitherto. The driver of a train which came off the rails at the Morpeth curve was prosecuted for driving under the influence of alcohol. However, the defence at the last minute provided medical evidence which suggested that at certain times the driver might pass out and the prosecution not having prior knowledge of this were unable to rebut it. The driver was acquitted.

      <comment>Armistice Convention with Austria-Hungary</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6072">The '''Armistice of Villa Giusti''' ended warfare between [[Italy]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] on the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Front]] during [[World War I]]. The [[armistice]] was signed on 3 November 1918 in the [[Villa Giusti]], outside [[Padua]] in the [[Veneto]], northern [[Italy]], and took effect 24 hours later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forost.ungarisches-institut.de/pdf/19181103-1.pdf Armistice Convention with Austria-Hungary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and terms==

By the end of October 1918, the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] was so fatigued that its commanders were forced to seek a ceasefire.
  
In the final stage of the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]], a stalemate was reached and the troops of [[Austria-Hungary]] started a chaotic withdrawal. From 28 October onwards, Austria-Hungary sought to negotiate a truce but hesitated to sign the text of armistice. In the meantime, the Italians reached [[Trento]], [[Udine]], and landed in [[Trieste]]. After the threat to break off negotiations, the Austro-Hungarians, on 3 November, accepted the terms.

The cease-fire would start at 3pm on 4 November, but a unilateral order of the Austro-Hungarian high command made its forces stop fighting on 3 November.

Under the terms of the armistice, Austria-Hungary’s forces were required to evacuate not only all territory occupied since August 1914 but also South Tirol, [[Tarvisio]], the [[Isonzo]] Valley, [[Gorizia]], [[Trieste]], [[Istria]], western [[Carniola]], and [[Dalmatia]]. All German forces should be expelled from Austria-Hungary within 15 days or interned, and the Allies were to have free use of Austria-Hungary’s internal communications. They were also obliged to allow the transit of the [[Entente cordiale|Entente]] armies, to reach Germany from the South.&lt;ref name="Cervone"&gt;{{cite book |first=Pier Paolo |last=Cervone |title=Vittorio Veneto, l'ultima battaglia |location=Milano |publisher=Mursia (Gruppo Editoriale) |year=1994 |isbn=88-425-1775-5 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in November 1918, the Italian Army with 20,000-22,000 soldiers occupied  [[Innsbruck]] and all [[North Tyrol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.agiati.it/UploadDocs/12255_Art_20_di_michele.pdf|title=Trento, Bolzano e Innsbruck: L’Occupazione Militare Italiana del Tirolo (1918-1920)|last=Di Michele|first=Andrea|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=436–37|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the Kingdom of Italy annexed the Southern Tyrol (now [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]]), according to the secret [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] terms as well as [[Trieste]] and the [[Austrian Littoral]].

{{Politics of Tonga}}

The position of '''[[Attorney General]]''' was established in the '''[[Tonga|Kingdom of Tonga]]''' in 1988. From 1988 to 2009, the Attorney General jointly held the office of Minister of Justice.&lt;ref name="matangitonga.to"&gt;[http://www.matangitonga.to/article/tonganews/government/20090601_attorneygen_alisi_taumoepeau.shtml "Minister of Justice and Attorney General resigns"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527150611/http://www.matangitonga.to/article/tonganews/government/20090601_attorneygen_alisi_taumoepeau.shtml |date=27 May 2011 }}, Matangi Tonga, 1 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Attorney General is [[Neil Adsett]], since 16 January 2012. He "has been a barrister and solicitor for over 30 years", and had recently been involved in Tonga's constitutional and electoral reforms. He is expected to serve for four years. He succeeded [[Barrie Sweetman]], a Fiji lawyer who had served in an interim capacity during the previous six months.&lt;ref name="IB"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130126162100/http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=MiddleMiddle/focusModuleID=130/focusContentID=27006/tableName=mediaRelease/overideSkinName=newsArticle-full.tpl "Neil Adsett appointed as Tonga’s new Attorney General"], ''Islands Business'', 24 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Tonga|Tongan government]] in 2010 defined the Attorney General as "Chief Legal Advisor to Government", with the following responsibilities:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmo.gov.to/component/content/article/55-lastes-news/395-attorney-general-of-the-kingdom-of-tonga.html "Attorney General of the Kingdom of Tonga"]{{dead link|date=October 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}, Tongan government website, March 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"Supporting constitutional integrity and governance; Ensuring legislative and statutory efficacy; Facilitating Government’s lawful and responsible legal dealings; Providing legal advice on law reform; Executing statutory enforcement powers; Perform [sic] responsibilities in an independent and transparent manner"''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pmo.gov.to/attorney-general-of-the-kingdom-of-tonga.html "Attorney General of the Kingdom of Tonga"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Tongan government website, 5 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Following constitutional reforms, applicable as from Adsett's appointment in January 2012, the Attorney General is reportedly
:''"the principal legal advisor to Cabinet and Government, and with the Solicitor General and other law officers will be responsible for prosecutions and legal cases for and against the government, the drafting of legislation for the Government and parliament, and generally for ensuring that the Constitution and laws of Tonga are understood and upheld by Government and individuals"''.&lt;ref name="IB" /&gt;

John Cauchi, appointed in May 2009, was the first Attorney General not to hold the portfolio of Justice Minister. He was also the first non-Tongan to hold the office, being an [[Australia]]n citizen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matangitonga.to/article/tonganews/law/2009020609_cauchi_attorneygen_tong.shtml "Tonga's new Attorney General"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527150629/http://www.matangitonga.to/article/tonganews/law/2009020609_cauchi_attorneygen_tong.shtml |date=27 May 2011 }}, Matangi Tonga, 2 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  He resigned the position on 30 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/asiapac/stories/201004/s2887482.htm|title=Tonga's Attorney General quits accusing Govt of protecting cronies|date=30 April 2010|publisher=[[Radio Australia]]|accessdate=2 June 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100502083130/http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/asiapac/stories/201004/s2887482.htm| archivedate= 2 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not currently clear how many people held the position between Cauchi's resignation and Sweetman's appointment. In early 2011, the [[CIA Factbook]] stated the Attorney General was [[ʻAsipeli ʻAminiasi Kefu]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/world-leaders-1/world-leaders-t/tonga.html Tonga: Cabinet members], CIA World Factbook, 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However this may have been an error, as other sources described Kefu as the [[Solicitor General of Tonga|Solicitor General]]. Minister for Justice [[Samiu Vaipulu]] was the Attorney General just prior to Sweetman's appointment; the latter thus disassociated the two positions, which had once again been combined in a single person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/pacbeat/stories/201109/s3307925.htm "Tonga's opposition welcomes foreign legal appointees"], Radio Australia, 1 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2011, the Kingdom has had at least seven Attorneys General.&lt;ref name="matangitonga.to" /&gt; [[Matangi Tonga]] has noted that three of the country's Attorneys General (namely Tupou and both Taumoepeaus) "have been told to resign".&lt;ref name="matangitonga.to" /&gt;

"'''Author's rights'''" is a term frequently used in connection with [[Intellectual property|laws about intellectual property]].{{Rights |Groups}}

The term is considered as a direct translation of the [[French language|French]] term '''''droit d’auteur''''' (also [[German language|German]] ''Urheberrecht''). It was indeed first (1777) promoted in France by [[Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais]], who had close relations with [[Benjamin Franklin]]. It is generally used in relation to the copyright laws of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries and in [[Copyright law of the European Union|European Union law]]. Authors' rights are internationally protected by the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] and by other similar treaties. Concerning "work of the spirit", “Author” is used in a very wide sense, and includes composers, artists, sculptors and even architects: in general, the author is the person whose creativity led to the protected work being created, although the exact definition varies from country to country. 

Authors’ rights have two distinct components: the economic rights in the work and the [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] of the author. The economic rights are a [[Property rights (economics)|property right]] which is limited in time and which may be transferred by the author to other people in the same way as any other property (although many countries require that the transfer must be in the form of a written [[contract]]). They are intended to allow the author or their holder to profit financially from his or her creation, and include the right to authorize the reproduction of the work in any form (Article&amp;nbsp;9, Berne Convention){{ref|Berne}}. The authors of [[Drama|dramatic works]] (plays, etc.) also have the right to authorize the public performance of their works (Article&amp;nbsp;11, Berne Convention).

The protection of the moral rights of an author is based on the view that a creative work is in some way an [[Sweat of the brow|expression of the author’s personality]]: the moral rights are therefore [[Inalienable right|personal to the author]], and cannot be transferred to another person except by [[Will (law)|testament]] when the author dies.{{ref|moral}} The moral rights regime differs greatly between countries, but typically includes the right to be identified as the author of the work and the right to object to any distortion or mutilation of the work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation (Article&amp;nbsp;6bis, Berne Convention). In many countries, the moral rights of an author are perpetual.

== Distinction between common law copyright and civil law authors’ rights ==
{{Intellectual property}}

Before the discovery of printing, the need for this right was not perceived because the number of handwritten copies was very small and there were not many authors by profession. From the sixteenth, in order to control the spread of thought and to guarantee the right of the bookseller, the police of printing erected the printing-houses in monopoly. Before any book would be printed, every bookseller should [[royalty payment|apply to the king for copyrights]]. Little by little (Beaumarchais, Balzac and Hugo) things changed. With author’s right, it was no more the fonts on the paper as a material thing which were considered, but the content of the book: the work of the spirit.

It is common to draw a distinction in the treatment of authors and other interested parties between common law jurisdictions and civil law systems. Both copyright and authors’ rights arose in the eighteenth century to address similar problems: the inequality in relations between authors and publishers (and between publishers themselves) if [[intellectual property]] is not recognized and protected, and the need to provide an income for authors other than [[patronage]]. Both systems provide for a [[monopoly]] right granted to the author for a limited term which can be transferred to another person, which was initially the right to copy or otherwise reproduce the work (hence “copyright”) but has since been expanded to take account of technological developments.

It is an essential feature of authors’ rights and of many copyright laws that the object which is protected must arise from the creativity of the author rather than from [[Sweat of the brow|his or her simple effort or investment]] (see ''[[Feist v. Rural]]'' in the [[United States]]): both [[French copyright law|French]] and [[German copyright law]]s protect “works of the mind” (''oeuvres de l'esprit'' and ''persönliche geistige Schöpfungen'',{{ref|DEGeistSch}} respectively). This has led civil law systems to adopt a strong link between the rights (at least initially) and the person of the author: the initial ownership rights by a [[corporation]] are severely restricted or even impossible (as in [[Germany]]{{ref|DEUrh}}). Common law jurisdictions are more willing to accept corporate ownership of copyright, as in the U. S. [[work for hire]] principle. Although the following comparison is simplistic and dependent on the exact laws of individual countries, it is difficult to see an effective (economic) difference in the two situations:
*Common law: employer owns the copyright in work created by employees
*Civil law: employer enjoys an exclusive licence to the economic rights in work created by employees

Civil law systems have also been forceful in protecting the moral rights of authors, arguing that their creativity deserves protection as an integral part of their personality. The protection of the personality in common law jurisdiction has for long been separate from the law of copyright, embodied in such [[tort]]s as [[defamation]] (also [[passing off]] and [[malicious falsehood]]). Moral rights were not, therefore, explicitly mentioned in [[Copyright law of the United Kingdom|UK copyright law]] until 1988,{{ref|UKmoral}} over a century after the United Kingdom signed the Berne Convention.{{ref|IEUSmoral}} The difference runs both ways: UK and Irish copyright laws protect the privacy of the subject of certain photographs and films as a moral right under copyright law,{{ref|UKIEportrait}} while civil law systems treat this as a separate [[portrait right]]. The different protections of [[industrial design rights]] cut across the divide between the two systems of law.

== Use in European Union law ==
The term “authors’ rights” is used in [[Copyright law of the European Union|European Union law]]{{ref|EUuse}} to avoid ambiguity, in preference to the more usual translation of ''droit d’auteur'' etc. as “copyright”. The equivalent term in [[Copyright law of the United Kingdom|British]] and [[Copyright law of the Republic of Ireland|Irish law]] is “copyright (subsisting) in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work”{{ref|UKIE}}; the term in Maltese and Cypriot law is similar, except that dramatic works are treated as a subset of literary works.{{ref|MTCY}}

=== Germany ===

Under a bill proposed by the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel approved by the Bundestag, Germany infringement of copyright is equivalent to the crime of theft. The prison sentences for violations of copyright, exactly equal to those provided for the theft, are five years in prison and are the strictest in Europe. For the offense may be indicted even children under 18 years. In addition, following the judgment of 20 October 1993 on the case Phil Collins, it was launched Article 12 (in the Treaty establishing the European Community), according to which states cannot discriminate against goods from other countries.

=== France ===

Since October 2009, as required under the Creation and Internet law n. 311, High Authority for the dissemination of works and protection of rights on the Internet (HADOPI) may order the ISP (Internet Service Provider), following a process of investigation and a series of warnings, to temporarily or permanently suspend the 'internet access to those who are caught downloading material illegally.

=== Italy ===

The Italian copyright law is governed primarily by Law 22 April 1941 n. 633, on "Protection of copyright and other rights associated with its exercise,"  and Article 2575 and following of the Civil Code (Book Five - Title IX: Of Intellectual property rights and on industrial inventions). Article 54 L.218 / 95 states as the proprietary rights are regulated by state law to use, although the advent of the internet complicate the identification of the place where the activity was carried out.

== Related (or neighbouring) rights ==
[[Related rights]] (in [[German language|German]] ''verwandte Schutzrechte''), often referred to as neighbouring rights as a more direct translation of the [[French language|French]] ''Droit Voisins'', are property rights granted to people who are not the “author” of the work in the creative sense of the term. Typically these include performers, producers of phonograms (records, CDs, etc.), producers of films (as opposed to directors or scriptwriters) and broadcasting organisations. Related rights are generally more restricted than authors’ rights in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries, although they may be equivalent in [[common law]] countries where both fall under the same concept of “[[copyright]]”. They are not directly covered by the [[Berne Convention]], but are internationally protected by other treaties such as the [[Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations]].{{ref|Rome}}

[[File:Himmelsblau.jpg|thumb|right|The emptiness of blue sky was a metaphor for the fraudulent basis of some securities that laws named after it sought to prevent by requiring disclosures to investors.|alt=A section of blue sky, featureless other than some light in the lower left corner]]
A '''blue sky law''' is a [[U.S. state|state]] law in the [[United States]] that regulates the offering and sale of [[security (finance)|securities]] ostensibly to protect the public from [[fraud]].  Though the specific provisions of these laws vary among states, they all require the registration of all securities offerings and sales, as well as of [[stockbroker]]s and [[brokerage firm]]s.  Each state's blue sky law is administered by its appropriate regulatory agency, and most also provide private [[cause of action|causes of action]] for private investors who have been injured by [[securities fraud]].

The first blue sky law was enacted in [[Kansas]] in 1911 at the urging of its banking commissioner, [[Joseph Norman Dolley]], and served as a model for similar statutes in other states. Between 1911 and 1933, 47 states adopted blue-sky statutes (Nevada was the lone holdout&lt;ref&gt;Simon, AER 1989, "The Effect of the 1933 Securities Act"&lt;/ref&gt;).  Today, the blue sky laws of 40 of the 50 states are patterned after the [[Uniform Securities Act]] of 1956. Historically, the federal securities laws and the state blue sky laws complemented and often duplicated one another. Much of the duplication, especially with regards to registration of securities and the regulation of brokers and advisors, was largely preempted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] with the [[National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996]] (NSMIA).  This act, however, left some regulation of investment advisors and much of the fraud litigation under state jurisdiction.  In 1998, state law securities fraud claims were expressly [[Federal preemption|preempted]] by the [[Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act]] from being raised in lawsuits that were effectively [[class action]]s by investors, even if not filed as class actions.

==Origin of the term ''Blue Sky'' in a securities context==
Its earliest cited use by the [[United States Supreme Court]] was in an opinion by [[U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Joseph McKenna]] in ''[[Hall v. Geiger-Jones Co.]]'', 242 U.S. 539 (1917), a case that addressed the constitutionality of state securities laws.  Oddly, McKenna is frequently (and erroneously) given credit for inventing the term, even though J. N. Dolley used the term when plumping for passage of the Kansas statute in 1910, and McKenna's own opinion in ''Hall'' itself attributes the term to an unnamed, earlier source: {{quote|The name that is given to the law indicates the evil at which it is aimed, that is, to use the language of a cited case, "speculative schemes which have no more basis than so many feet of 'blue sky'"; or, as stated by counsel in another case, "to stop the sale of stock in fly-by-night concerns, visionary oil wells, distant gold mines and other like fraudulent exploitations." Even if the descriptions be regarded as rhetorical, the existence of evil is indicated, and a belief of its detriment; and we shall not pause to do more than state that the prevention of deception is within the competency of government and that the appreciation of the consequences of it is not open for our review.}}

Kansas banking commissioner Dolley, railing against "blue sky merchants" when pushing for passage of the Kansas statute in 1910, observed that certain fraudulent investments were backed by nothing but the blue skies of Kansas. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has a cited use dating to 1906.  Also, ''[[The New York Times]]'' (and other national newspapers) frequently reported on the blue sky laws as various states began to enact them between 1911 and 1916. The newspapers expressly used the term ''blue sky'' to describe the laws.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7765">'''Conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline''' is an offence against [[military justice|military law]] in many countries.  It has existed in military law since before the 17th century and is an important offence which functions as a catch-all to criminalise offences against military order which are not specified elsewhere. 

==Background==
The offence of "conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline" has been described as one of the offences that forms the "hardcore of military law".&lt;ref name=devil111&gt;Nichols p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  The offence is present in the military law of many countries and is often considered a [[wiktionary:catch-all|catch-all]] offence to criminalise misconduct that is not specified elsewhere.&lt;ref name=guide79&gt;Davidson p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=devil130&gt;Nichols p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  

This kind of offence was first introduced to [[England|English]] military law in the 17th century, the law having previously been "minute in its details" with no catch-all article.&lt;ref name=devil114&gt;Nichols p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;  However such articles were found in continental military law such as the Swedish Articles of [[Gustavus Adolphus]] issued in 1621 which allowed for "whatsoever is not contained in these articles, and is repugnant to military discipline ... shall the several commanders make good, or see severally punished".&lt;ref name=devil114/&gt;  A form of this catch-all article was introduced to England in the [[Articles of War]] for 1625 which stated that "all other disorders whatsoever are to be punished, as these formerly nominated".&lt;ref name=devil113&gt;Nichols p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;  This had been expanded on in the 1627 articles stated that "all other abuses and offences not specified in these orders shall be punished according to the discipline of war and opinions of such officers and others shall be called to make a [[Council of war|''Councell of Warr'']]".&lt;ref name=devil113/&gt;

The article took on something of its modern form in 1642 when the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]'s Articles of War stated that "all other faults, disorders and offences, not mentioned in these articles, shall be punished according to the general customs and laws of war".&lt;ref name=devil113/&gt;&lt;ref name=guide80/&gt;  The "conduct to the prejudice" concept was introduced at some point after 1700.&lt;ref name=devil114/&gt;  By the late 18th century the offence had become article 23 of the [[United Kingdom|British]] military law and allowed for the punishment of "all disorders or neglects ... to the prejudice of good order and military discipline".&lt;ref name=guide80/&gt;  This part of British military law was adopted by the [[Continental Congress]] for use in the military of the [[United States]] in 1775.&lt;ref name=guide80/&gt;  By 1835 the article was commonly known as the "Devil's article" within the British Army.&lt;ref name=devil112&gt;Nichols p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{See also|General article (military law)}}
In the [[US Armed Forces]] the offence is covered by article 134 (the [[General article (military law)|"general article"]]) of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ). This section states that "all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces" shall be tried by court martial and punished at the discretion of that court. The general article also covers offences which bring discredit upon the armed forces and "crimes and offenses not capital".&lt;ref name=UCMJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/references/ucmj/ucmj2.html#899|title=Uniform Code of Military Justice: Subchapter IX|publisher=US Government|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UCMJ requires that all acts be directly prejudicial to good order and discipline. Examples of misconduct prosecuted under the act includes a [[Chief Petty Officer]] "cross dressing in public view", a [[Sergeant]] who [[mooning|mooned]] another servicemember's wife and a seaman making unauthorised long distance calls. Examples of conduct listed in the [[Manual for Courts-Martial]] include adultery, bribery, fraternization, gambling, [[wikt:straggle|straggling]], and [[Profanity|indecent language]].&lt;ref name=guide80&gt;Davidson p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''E-G8 Forum''' (or simply the '''eG8''') was an invitation-only [[Summit (meeting)|summit]] of leaders in government and industry focusing on the Internet in the context of global [[public policy]]. The event was put on by Publicis Groupe and was convened by French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] from May 24-25th 2011, prior to the [[37th G8 summit]], and was held at the [[Tuileries Garden]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=Pfanner20&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/21/technology/21tech.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Chaos of Internet Will Meet French Sense of Order |last=Pfanner |first=Eric |date=May 20, 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The idea for the event came up on a blog post by [[Tariq Krim]] in which the founder of [[Netvibes]] complained that France doesn't have its own [[Chief technology officer|CTO]].&lt;ref&gt;Tariq Krim, [http://tariqkrim.posterous.com/france-needs-a-cto-now France needs a CTO now !], ''blog de Tariq Krim'', 31 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The blog post was reposted by Arnaud Dassier and [[Loïc Le Meur]], and read by the [[Elysée]]'s technical counsellor [[Nicolas Princen]], who then convinced [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] to take a step towards the French digital natives after the failure of [[Hadopi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.petitweb.fr/actualites/eg8-le-divorce-entre-la-salle-et-lestrade/ EG8 : le divorce entre la salle et l’estrade], 30 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference, which was the first of its kind,&lt;ref name=Pfanner20/&gt; was a meeting of international government figures and those in the global technology industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/eg8-france |title=The Truth About the eG8, The Huge Forum Of Tech CEOs And World Leaders |last=Gobry |first=Pascal-Emmanuel |date=May 5, 2011 |work=[[Business Insider]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; It included participants such as [[Eric Schmidt]] from [[Google]], [[Sheryl Sandberg]] and [[Mark Zuckerberg]] from [[Facebook]], [[Jimmy Wales]] from the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], French [[Minister of the Economy, Industry and Employment (France)|Minister of the Economy]] [[Christine Lagarde]], [[Rupert Murdoch]] from [[News Corp]], and was opened with a speech by Sarkozy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/24/sarkozy-opens-e-g8-summit |last=Willsher |first=Kim |title=Sarkozy opens 'historic' forum on future of internet in runup to G8 |work=[[guardian.co.uk]] |date=24 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few invitees, such as author [[Cory Doctorow]], refused to attend in protest before it even began, and claimed the event was, more or less, a PR stunt financed by the advertising industry and Sarkozy's connections to Publicis Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boingboing.net/2011/05/17/fight-back-against-s.html |title=Fight back against Sarkozy's EG8 -- an exercise in censorship and control dressed up as a technology summit |last=Doctorow |first=Cory |authorlink=Cory Doctorow |date=May 17, 2011 |work=[[Boing Boing]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and reactions==
[[File:E-G8 - Clôture avec Mark Zuckerberg 2.jpg|thumb|Zuckerberg closed the event]]
The discussion over the two-day meeting surfaced many tensions between technologists and policy makers. In general, Sarkozy led a camp pushing for further [[government regulation]] (such as [[HADOPI law]] in France) to protect [[Minor (law)|minors]], prevent  or punish [[copyright infringement]], and to encourage economic growth through [[electronic commerce]].&lt;ref name=Pfanner20/&gt; Participants such as [[John Perry Barlow]], [[Yochai Benkler]], Zuckerberg, and Schmidt spoke out during the event against tight regulatory control of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google, Facebook warn on Internet rules at e-G8|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/25/us-eg-idUSTRE74O72L20110525|accessdate=30 May 2011|newspaper=Reuters|date=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/152619/20110526/unresolved-conflicts-mark-close-of-eg8.htm |title=Unresolved Conflicts Mark Close of eG8 |last=Phillips |first=James Lee |date=May 26, 2011 |work=[[International Business Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pfanner24/&gt;  While the forum was publicized as a way for technology leaders to participate in the G8's thinking on Internet-related public policy, a copy of a communique from the G8 which was composed before the closing of the Forum was leaked to ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Pfanner24&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/technology/25tech.html |title=G-8 Leaders to Call for Tighter Internet Regulation |last=Pfanner |first=Eric |date=May 24, 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circuit]] that includes the first recognition of [[retaliatory eviction]] as a defense to [[eviction]] in [[real property law|landlord-tenant law]].

==Factual background==
Plaintiff Edwards [[lease|rented]] property from defendant Habib on a month-to-month basis.  Habib failed to address sanitary code violations brought up by Edwards, so Edwards reported Habib to the Department of Licenses and the Inspection Department.  An inspection revealed 40 sanitary code violations, and Habib was ordered to rectify the violations.  After the inspection, Habib obtained a default judgment against Edwards in a statutory eviction action.

==Holding==
The court held that a tenant cannot be evicted for reporting sanitary code violations, and this became known as the defense of retaliatory eviction.&lt;ref&gt;Casner, A.J. et al.  ''Cases and Text on Property, Fifth Edition.''  Apsen Publishers, New York, NY: 2004.  P. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6104">During the beginning of the German invasions during [[World War II]], [[Jacques Jaujard]], the  director of the French [[Réunion des Musées Nationaux|Musées Nationaux]], foreshadowed the fall of France and decided to organize the evacuation of the [[Louvre]] art collection in province.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web

| publisher=[[The Guardian]]

== Evacuation of the art collection ==

[[File:La Grande Gallerie désertée.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The Grande Gallerie in September 1939]]
On 25 August 1939, the Louvre was closed for 3 days, officially for repairs. However, many of the Louvre art collection was hauled on trucks (203 vehicles transporting 1862 wooden cases) and sent to [[Château de Chambord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some of the art pieces were too big to be fit in a truck. For example [[The Raft of the Medusa]] had to be covered with a blanket. When the truck initially arrived at Versailles on his route to Chambord, the canvas touched an electric cable and created a short-circuit which switched off the electricity in the whole town. After that, the routes were carefully planned to avoid this type of problems, and attendants which poles were responsible to deal with electric or phone cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Knopf]], pp. 54–55. {{ISBN|978-0-679-40069-1}}; OCLC 246524635&lt;/ref&gt;

The last art piece to leave the museum was the [[Winged Victory of Samothrace]], which was moved on September 3, 1939, the day the French ultimatum to Germany expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the war, the arts pieces were clandestinely moved from chateau to chateau to avoid being taken back by the Nazis.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; For example, the ''Mona Lisa'' was moved from Chambord to several castles and abbeys, to finish at the end of the war at the [[Musée Ingres]] in [[Montauban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| quote=''The only wartime documents available about the Mona Lisa say that on 27 August 1939 it was packed in a specially-marked crate, tailor-made in 1938, of double-thick poplar wood. Along with other artworks from French national museums, it was sent for storage, first to Chambord Castle in the Loire Valley. On 5 June 1940, it was transferred to Chauvigny on a cushioned stretcher in the back of an ambulance, which had been sealed to keep the humidity constant (the official who accompanied the painting arrived nearly asphyxiated from the lack of circulation in the sealed vehicle). In September, it moved again, to the Ingres Museum in Montauban, before a final move to Montal in 1942''

== The arrival of the German army in Paris ==
On 16 August 1940, count [[Franz von Wolff-Metternich]], who was responsible of the conservation of the French art collections under the [[Kunstschutz]] principle, arrived in Paris to oversee France’s art collection, but the museum was almost empty. He knew what was going on but voluntarily did not do anything.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Flexible Citizenship''' is an ideology on [[citizenship]] that asserts that economic reasons are the primary reason people choose their [[citizenship]] as opposed to identifying with a community based on shared [[political rights]].{{sfn|Ong|1998|p=137}}

== Background ==

Flexible citizenship is a form of citizenship that redefines the traditional citizenship view based on membership of political rights and participation within a nation state. Flexible citizenship is arguably based on that [[globalization]] has made economic concerns the major contributing factor in people in ‘choosing’ their citizenship as opposed to citizenship based on an allegiance to country’s government.  Therefore, people arguably will choose their citizenship based on economic reasons rather than political rights or participation within what nation state they reside.{{sfn|Ong|1998|p=139}}

== History ==

The thought of flexible citizenship has arisen over the past few decades after the [[Cold War]].  Due to the growing changes and increasing levels of technology in the world, flexible citizenship has become applicable to many [[Human migration|migrants]] within many different states. Globalization has been the primary reason for the development of various new forms of citizenship.  Due to Globalization, the access to borders has become increasingly easier for people to move from nation to nation.{{sfn|Karns|2009|p=145}} Also, it has given people the greater opportunity to gain access on information where the greatest accesses to jobs are held.  Due to the great migrations and interconnected borders that have arisen from globalization, traditional citizenship has been challenged by various scholars who have brought forth new thoughts of how citizenship should work in the contemporary world.  For instance, the Cosmopolitan scholars such as Nussbaum and Appiah and Post-national citizenship theorists have challenged the view of looking towards citizenship as purely based on rights to political participation.{{sfn|Appiah|1998|p=96}}
   
This form of citizenship could arguably been derived from a form of transnational citizenship that is clearly seen in contemporary society.  These individuals travel to nations to find employment, but do not have the same the traditional rights (such as political rights) that residents gain in their society.  Although most of these migrants lack political rights, they do have some employment rights in countries like the United States.&lt;ref name="mexpert"&gt;{{cite web|work=Migrationexpert: USA Visa Services |title=New Agreement Signed to Protect U.S. Migrant Workers |url=http://www.migrationexpert.com/visa/us_immigration_news/2011/aug/0/394/new_agreement_signed_to_protect_u.s._migrant_workers |date=31 August 2011 |accessdate= 19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications of flexible citizenship ==

As it is true that populations of people have been traveling around the world all of history to find greater access to economic gains, it has never been this numerous.  Predominantly during the 1980s, there began an increasing trend of populations (predominantly from Taiwan and Hong Kong) to travel around the world to search for work to send back to their families in their country of origin.&lt;ref name="globalaffairs"/&gt;    Many people from these areas searched for as migration workers in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.  However, it not just migration workers that use this flexible citizenship for their advantage.  Numerous Chinese elites send their children overseas to these countries universities to gain access to an elite education that will benefit them in country of origin,&lt;ref name="globalaffairs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese "astronaut families"|url=http://www.globalaffairs.es/en/chinese-%E2%80%9Castronaut-families%E2%80%9D/|accessdate=19 November 2011|last=Mateu|first=Jaime|work=Globalaffairs.es|date=15 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and could also set up important business connections that could benefit their country of origin.    This term of the “astronaut family” has been developed to challenge the traditional view of the nuclear family. 

Within in some countries in Europe, it is clear to see some contemporary examples of flexible citizenship.  The example of Turkish guest workers in Germany is a great example of both transnationalism and flexible citizenship.  For instance, after World War II there was shortage of able-bodied men to work lower position jobs, therefore migrant workers from many different countries were recruited to take this position.&lt;ref name="chin"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Rita|last=Chin |title=Imagining a German Multiculturalism: Aras Ören and the Contested Meanings of the 'Guest Worker,' 1955-1980|journal=Radical History Review |volume=83|issue=2|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Primarily, these guest workers came from Turkey to fill these positions.   Although there was initially a rule of ‘quick return’ for the migrant workers, the German government realized it was more profitable to keep the migrant workers there, and issued them guest worker permits that let these Turkish guest workers stay indefinitely.&lt;ref name="chin"/&gt;

In the United States, it is clear to see more examples of flexible citizenship with looking towards the migrant workers in the Southwest.  As stated early, migrant workers in the United States have the rights to information on workers compensation and a minimum wage.&lt;ref name="mexpert"/&gt; However, many of these migrant workers live below the poverty line and do not receive these wages due to the fear of deportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=21 November 2011|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cmw.htm|date=18 December 1990|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119100956/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cmw.htm|archivedate=19 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The primary argument that most of these migrants have left their country of origin is once again economic concerns, and finding job opportunities in the United States.  For instance, there are abundance of farmwork jobs in the United States that many United States citizens are unwilling to work.  Therefore, many of these migrant workers are granted permit residence as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=Alan K. |work=Bill Summary &amp; Status 99th Congress (1985 - 1986) S.1200 All Information. |title=Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d099:SN01200:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;%7CTOM:/bss/d099query.html |accessdate= 23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Declaration==

In October 2002 the meeting of LIIs in Montreal at the 4th Law via Internet Conference, made the following declaration&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [http://www.worldlii.org/worldlii/declaration/montreal_en.html WorldlII]&lt;/ref&gt; as a joint statement of their philosophy of access to law. There were some further modifications of the Declaration at the Sydney meeting of LIIs in 2003&lt;ref&gt;The amendments were: (i) in the title of the Declaration, `public' was changed to `free'; (ii) the words `where possible' were deleted from the second bullet point `where possible, free of charge'; (iii) addition of the description of a legal information institute and the encouragement to participate in networks; and (iv) addition of the final bullet point about an annual meeting to the list of areas of agreed cooperation.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Paris meeting in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;The amendments were: (i) the words "It also includes legal documents created as a result of public funding." were added to the end of para 2 after 'boards of enquiry': (ii) the words "To provide to the end users of public legal information clear information concerning any conditions of re-use of that information, where this is feasible." were added to the final list of bullet points.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|Legal information institutes of the world, meeting in Montreal, declare that,
* Public legal information from all countries and international institutions is part of the common heritage of humanity. Maximising access to this information promotes justice and the rule of law;
* Public legal information is digital common property and should be accessible to all on a non-profit basis and free of charge;
* Independent non-profit organisations have the right to publish public legal information and the government bodies that create or control that information should provide access to it so that it can be published.

Public legal information means legal information produced by public bodies that have a duty to produce law and make it public. It includes primary sources of law, such as legislation, case law and treaties, as well as various secondary (interpretative) public sources, such as reports on preparatory work and law reform, and resulting from boards of inquiry. It also includes legal documents created as a result of public funding.

A legal information institute,
* Publishes via the internet public legal information originating from more than one public body;
* Provides free, full and anonymous public access to that information;
* Does not impede others from publishing public legal information; and
* Supports the objectives set out in this Declaration.

All legal information institutes are encouraged to participate in regional or global free access to law networks.

Therefore, the legal information institutes agree,
* To promote and support free access to public legal information throughout the world, principally via the Internet;
* To cooperate in order to achieve these goals and, in particular, to assist organisations in developing countries to achieve these goals, recognising the reciprocal advantages that all obtain from access to each other's law;
* To help each other and to support, within their means, other organisations that share these goals with respect to,
** Promotion, to governments and other organisations, of public policy conducive to the accessibility of public legal information;
** Technical assistance, advice and training;
** Development of open technical standards;
** Academic exchange of research results.
* To meet at least annually, and to invite other organisations who are legal information institutes to subscribe to this declaration and join those meetings, according to procedures to be established by the parties to this Declaration.
* To provide to the end users of public legal information clear information concerning any conditions of re-use of that information, where this is feasible.}}

'''Grandparent visitation''' is a legal right that [[grandparent]]s in some jurisdictions may have to have court-ordered [[contact (law)|contact]] (or visitation) with their grandchildren.

==United States==
In the [[United States]], most states have statutes that describe when a third party, such as a grandparent, may ask a court to grant them the legal right to maintain ongoing contact with somebody else's child. Many states have laws that specifically address the rights of grandparents. However, a federal Supreme Court decision called [[Troxel v. Granville]] places limits on when states can grant visitation rights to third parties, including grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Grandparents' Rights to Visitation|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/child_custody/grandparents_rights.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=10 July 2017|date=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State laws vary greatly, and no state guarantees that the grandparents will be able to obtain a court order granting them visitation, unless it is in the best interests of the child. The rationale behind these laws is that sometimes, especially with the death of a parent or in a family that has undergone [[divorce]], the children may not have the opportunity to have contact with the [[child custody#Non-custodial parents|non-custodial parent]] and his relatives, thus fostering continued familial bonds. Those opposing this view say that court-ordered grandparent visitation infringes upon the fundamental right of fit parents to raise their child in the manner that they see fit (including the right to decide with whom the child will associate). Grandparent's rights to see their grandchildren, following death, divorce, child born out of wedlock, or where the child does not reside in the home of a parent, was first created by Bloomfield Hills, Michigan Family Law Attorney, Richard S. Victor who later went on to form the national nonprofit Grandparents Rights Organization (GRO) in the early 1980's and which still exists today. 

In mosts states grandparent rights exists however, the grandparent must obtain their own attorney. They will not be awarded an assigned counsel.  

Organizations, like the Grandparents Rights Organization, are working on some changes in the law to provide grandparents automatic visitation upon the death of a parent (their child) to allow for continued family interaction with that part of their family.  

===Impact of ''Troxel v. Granville''===
In the case of ''[[Troxel v. Granville]]'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] stated that "the interest of parents in the care, custody and control of their children--is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court."&lt;ref&gt;''Troxel v. Granville'', 530 U.S. 57, 65; 120 S Ct 2054, 2060 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court also made it clear that this fundamental right is implicated in grandparent visitation cases. The plurality opinion stated at the outset that statutes allowing grandparent visitation orders to be imposed over parental objection "present questions of constitutional import." However, the court clearly held that the states that did have grandparent visitation laws would not be held unconstitutional on their face, as requested in the case.  The Supreme Court declared that a parent's fundamental right to the "care, custody and control of their children" was "at issue in this case." They held that in order for state laws to be constitutional, three things need to be in the law: 1) If there is a claim or action filed, it is the grandparent that has the burden of proof; 2) The court should give "deference" to a "fit" parent's decision; and 3) The grandparent may still proceed with their request for grandparent visitation and overcome being denied contact; and each state should have a set of factors for the court to evaluate when deciding to either grant or deny a grandparent's request, over a parent's objections. The Supreme Court struck down the Washington visitation statute because it was not their grandparent visitation statute that was being evaluated and the statute that the grandparent filed under was "over broad" and too excessive. Prior to the case being heard by the US Supreme Court, the state legislature in Washington repelled the law in question, but allowed their grandparent visitation law to remain in place, as that law was never challenged in the case. 

State courts considering non-parent visitation petitions must apply "a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children.".&lt;ref&gt;''Troxel'', 530 US at 69; 120 S Ct at 2061, 2062.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Troxel'' requires that state courts must give "deference" or some special weight to a fit parent's decision to deny non-parent visitation. "Choices [parents make] about the upbringing of children... are among constitutional rights, but were not an absolute right... sheltered by the Fourteenth Amendment against the State's unwarranted usurpation, disregard, or disrespect."&lt;ref&gt;''[[M.L.B. v. S.L.J.]]'', 519 U.S. 102, 116-117 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; This principle must inform the understanding of the "special weight" that ''Troxel'' requires courts to give to parents' decisions concerning whether, when and how grandparents will associate with their children. Even though ''Troxel'' does not define "special weight," previous Supreme Court precedent indicates that "special weight" is a strong term signifying very considerable deference.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[[Comstock v. Group of Institutional Investors]]'', 335 US 211, 230 (1948); ''[[Tibbs v. Florida]]'', 457 US 31 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; The "special weight" requirement, as illuminated by these prior Supreme Court cases, means that the deference provided to the parent's wishes will be overcome only by some compelling governmental interest and by overwhelmingly clear factual circumstances supporting that governmental interest.

* A person who is a descendant of a citizen of Grenada by birth (grandparent) - Section 5A
* A person who is/or has been married to a citizen of Grenada - Section 5(3) 
* Commonwealth &amp; Irish citizens – may apply for citizenship by registration under Section 6(1) provided that the person have been legally living in Grenada for 7 years (citizens from Non-Caribbean Countries), OR 4 years (citizens of Caribbean countries) AND 2 years as holder of a Permanent Residence Permit (within the applicable citizenship requirement period) immediately preceding the date of application. &lt;ref&gt;[http://antiguaobserver.com/new-regulations-governing-citizenship-for-grenada/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Citizenship by naturalisation ==
* Aliens or British Protected Persons can apply for Grenadian citizenship by naturalisation under Sch. 5 Reg. 7 of the Grenada Citizenship Act, if they have been legally living in Grenada for 7 years AND 2 Years as a Permanent Resident (within the seven-year period) immediately preceding the date of application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiguaobserver.com/new-regulations-governing-citizenship-for-grenada/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dual Citizenship ==
Grenadian law allows their citizens to hold [[dual citizenship]].

== Rights and privileges of Grenadian citizens ==

=== In Grenada ===
Grenadian citizens enjoy the following rights (subject to certain exceptions):
* the right to enter and remain in Grenada at any time without an immigration permit.
* Entitlement to a Grenadian passport and to Grenadian consular protection overseas.
* Immunity to deportation.
* Entitlement to vote and stand for public office.
* Entitlement to leave Grenada and return at any time without requirement a visa.
* Entitlement to pass Grenadian citizenship by descent or registration to children born outside Grenada.
* Full access to education rights and scholarships.
* Ability to apply for public service jobs reserved to Grenadian citizens.
* Access to international sport (in some sports, international players must be citizens of the country they represent).

=== In other Commonwealth Countries ===
As Commonwealth citizens, Grenadians are afforded a number of privileges in some Commonwealth countries.

In the United Kingdom, Grenadian citizens enjoy the following privileges:

* the right to vote in all elections (i.e., parliamentary, local and European elections) as long they have registered to vote (they must possess valid leave to enter/remain or right of abode on the date of their electoral registration application)
* the right, unless other disqualified, to stand for election to the British House of Commons as long as they possess indefinite leave to remain or do not require leave under the Immigration Act 1971 to enter or remain in the UK.
* the right, if a qualifying peer or bishop, to sit in the House of Lords.
* Eligibility to hold public office (e.g., as judge, magistrate, minister, police constable, member of armed forces, etc.)
* the right of abode (for those born before 1983 who meet the requirements)
* access to UK Ancestry Entry Clearance (for those with a grandparent born in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, or in the Republic or Ireland on or before 31 March 1922)
* may not be required to register with the police while living in the United Kingdom

In [[New Zealand]], [[Mauritius]], [[Malawi]] and many Commonwealth countries in the Caribbean, Grenadian citizens who are long-term residents have the right to vote in elections.

== Visa requirements ==
[[File:Visa requirements for Grenadian citizens.png|thumb|450px|right|Visa requirements for Grenadian citizens {{legend|red|Grenada}}{{legend|#22b14c|Visa free access}}{{legend|greenyellow|Visa on arrival}}{{legend|#61c09a|eVisa}}{{legend|#79D343|Visa available both on arrival or online}}{{legend|lightgrey|Visa required}}]]
{{main article|Visa requirements for Grenadian citizens}}

Visa requirements for Grenadian citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[Grenada]]. As of October 2018, Grenadian citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 144 countries and territories, ranking the ordinary [[Grenadian passport]] 33rd in the world according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa Restrictions Index|Visa Restrictions Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Visa Restriction Index 2018|url=https://www.henleyglobal.com/files/download/HPI2018/PI%202018%20INFOGRAPHS%20GLOBAL%20181008.pdf|publisher=Henley &amp; Partners|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oath of Citizenship ==
Non-Commonwealth nationals may be required to swear an oath of allegiance to the [[Queen of Grenada]]:

I, A.B., do solemnly and sincerely affirm and declare that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen [[Elizabeth the Second]], Her Heirs and Successors, according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of [[Grenada]] and full my duties as a citizen of [[Grenada]]. So help me God.

== Consular protection ==
Grenadian citizens who require consular assistance in a foreign country where there is no Grenadian foreign mission may be able to request assistance from a British Embassy, high commission or consulate. For example, Grenadians who need to travel urgently and whose passport has expired, been lost or stolen can be issued with an emergency travel document by a British foreign mission as long as this has cleared with the Grenadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

== Loss of Grenadian citizenship ==
Any citizen of [[Grenada]] of full age and capacity may voluntary renounce his or her citizenship as of Section 10 of the Grenada Citizenship Act, 1976.

== Grenada and British nationality ==
Prior to 1974 persons connected with [[Grenada]] held [[British nationality]]. Grenadians were mainly classified as Citizens of UK and Colonies (CUKCs). Upon independence from the United Kingdom, Grenada became a commonwealth realm with HM Queen Elizabeth II as Head of State.

Persons connected with [[Grenada]] at independence may have retained citizenship of the UK and colonies if:
* they did not acquire Grenadian citizenship;
* they had specified ties with the UK itself i.e. parent or grandparent who was born or naturalised in the UK or in a place which remained a [[British Overseas Territory]].

Such persons would have become British citizens on 1 January 1983 if they had specified ties to the UK. Otherwise they would have become British Overseas Citizens.

A '''hybrid offence''', '''dual offence''', '''Crown option offence''',  '''dual procedure offence''', '''offence triable either way'''  or '''wobbler''' is one of the special class offences in the [[common law]] jurisdictions where the case may be prosecuted either summarily or as indictment. In the [[United States]], an alternative misdemeanor/felony offense (colloquially known as a '''wobbler''') lists both county jail ([[misdemeanor]] sentence) and state prison ([[felony]] sentence) as possible punishment. Similarly, a '''wobblette''' is a crime that can be charged either as a misdemeanor or an [[infraction]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.shouselaw.com/wobbler.html, "Legal definition of a "Wobbler" in California law"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
The power to choose under which class a hybrid offence will be tried rests with the [[crown counsel]].  Hybrid offences can either be [[summary offence#Canada|summary offence]]s (minor crimes) or [[indictable offence]]s (major crimes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal offences|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/cj-jp/victims-victimes/court-tribunaux/offences-infractions.html|website=Government of Canada|accessdate=27 April 2018|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most indictable offences, a person has the right to [[trial by jury]].

A hybrid offence is the most common type of charge in Canada. There are three types of charges and each will affect when you can apply for a Record Suspension.

Under the [[Criminal Records Act]], Section 2.1,&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-47/page-1.html#h-4], ''[[Criminal Records Act]]'', R.S.C., 1985, c. C-47&lt;/ref&gt; the Parole Board of Canada is the administrative tribunal that has the exclusive authority to make decisions regarding Record Suspensions. A Record Suspension is a formal means to remove the disadvantages associated with having a Criminal Record for people that have been convicted of a criminal offence. In order to apply for a Record Suspension an individual must complete an application that is later reviewed by the Board and a decision to grant, or deny the application is made by an officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Record Suspensions - Fact Sheet|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/parole-board/corporate/publications-and-forms/fact-sheets/record-suspensions-fact-sheet.html|website=Government of Canada|accessdate=27 April 2018|date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Section 7, the Parole Board of Canada also has the ability to revoke granted Record Suspensions if there is a breach in good conduct on the part of the applicant or if a person reoffends and commits an indictable offence and even in some cases a summary offence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-47/page-3.html#h-8], ''[[Criminal Records Act]]'', R.S.C., 1985, c. C-47&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Wales==
In relation to [[England and Wales]], the expression "offence triable either way" means an offence, other than an offence triable on [[indictment]] only by virtue of Part V of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]], which, if committed by an adult, is triable either on indictment or summarily; and the term "triable either way", in its application to offences, is to be construed accordingly. In this definition, references to the ways in which an offence is triable are to be construed without regard to the effect, if any, of section 22 of the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]] on the mode of trial in a particular case.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Interpretation Act 1978]], section 5 and Schedule 1 (in the heading [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/30/schedule/1/crossheading/construction-of-certain-expressions-relating-to-offences "construction of certain expressions relating to offences"]), as amended by section 170 of, and paragraph 59 of Schedule 15 to, the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]], and by section 154 of, and paragraph 169 of Schedule 7 to, the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English criminal law]] a hybrid offence is called a "triable-either-way offence" and can be heard at either the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]] or [[Crown Court]].  The decision as to which court will hear the case is determined at a Mode of Trial hearing.

The magistrates decide if the case is suitable to be heard in the Magistrates' Court. If they decide that the case is either too serious or too complex, they can send the case to the Crown Court in which case the defendant has no say in the matter. If the magistrates decide that the case is suitable to be heard by the magistrates then the defendant is asked for consent to do so. The defendant can then either consent to be tried by the magistrates or opt for trial by jury at the [[Crown Court]] provided that they have pleaded not guilty. If they have pleaded guilty then they have no say in the matter - thus there is no way for a defendant to [[plea bargaining|agree to plead guilty]] in exchange for having a case dealt with by magistrates.

If the defendant is tried summarily in the Magistrates' Court and is convicted, there may still be a committal to the Crown Court for sentencing if the magistrates think that their sentencing  powers are inadequate.

===History===
The expression "hybrid offence" was applicable to an offence triable either on indictment or summarily. It was applicable to offences to which section 18 of the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1952]] applied.&lt;ref&gt;Aldridge, Trevor M. The Criminal Law Act 1977. Butterworths. 1978. {{ISBN|0-406-55211-8}}. paragraph 195 at page 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

See sections 14(c) and 64 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]].

==Scotland==
In [[Scots law]], all common law offences other than those within the exclusive jurisdiction of the [[High Court of Justiciary]] (i.e. [[murder]], [[treason]], [[rape]] and breach of duty by magistrates)&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, section 3&lt;/ref&gt; can be tried either summarily in the [[justice of the peace court]]s or [[Sheriff Court]]s, or on indictment in the High Court of Justiciary or Sheriff Court. For statutory offences, the statute will provide whether the offence is triable summarily, on indictment, or both. 

The choice of forum is a matter for the [[Lord Advocate]] and [[procurator fiscal]], and is determined in a process known as marking.

==United States==
In [[U.S. state]]s in which these offenses occur, the prosecuting attorney has discretion in deciding which category to charge the defendant. Prosecutors may strategically file such offenses as felonies, agreeing to refile the charge as a misdemeanor should the defendant consent to a guilty plea.

After hearing evidence at a [[preliminary hearing]], the judge or magistrate has discretion to reduce a felony wobbler to a misdemeanor charge; the opposite is not permitted.

In [[juvenile court]], after a minor is declared to be delinquent following a bench trial or open plea, the judge may classify a wobbler felony as a misdemeanor instead.

===California===
In California, one example of a wobbler offense is grand theft (PC487).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=484-502.9|title=California Penal Code, Section 484-502.9|accessdate=2010-06-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628225209/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=484-502.9|archivedate=2010-06-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the judge has the power to reduce a felony charge of this type to a misdemeanor during various stages of the proceeding, including the preliminary hearing all the way until after a defendant completes probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Davina|title=California “Wobblers”:  How to De termine Whether a Prior California  Conviction Was a Felony or a Misdemeanor|url=https://www.fd.org/sites/default/files/criminal_defense_topics/essential_topics/sentencing_resources/clemency/clemency-how-to-determine-whether-a-prior-california-conviction-was-a-felony-or-misdemeanor.pdf|website=Defender Services Office, Training Division|publisher=Administrative Office of the United States Courts|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kowloon Waterfront, Hong Kong, 2013-08-09, DD 05.jpg|thumbnail|A row of taxis idling in Hong Kong]]
'''Idling''' refers to running a vehicle's engine when the vehicle is not in motion. This commonly occurs when drivers are stopped at a red light, waiting while parked outside a business or residence, or otherwise stationary with the engine running. When idling, the engine runs without any loads except the engine accessories.

== Vehicle emissions ==
Both running an engine and idling an engine produce several pollutants that are monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency. Emission facts: idling vehicle emissions. April 1998. Accessed at [https://web.archive.org/web/20050724123833/http://www.epa.gov/oms/consumer/f98014.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often believed that stopping and restarting the engine uses more gas than idling. In reality, an engine restart uses fuel approximately equal to 10 seconds of idling.&lt;ref name=EDF2008&gt;Environmental Defense Fund. (2008) Attention Drivers! Turn Off Your Idling Engines. Accessed at http://www.edf.org/transportation/reports/idling.&lt;/ref&gt;
Restarting the engine also causes less engine wear than idling.&lt;ref name=EDF2008 /&gt;

== Health effects of idling pollutants ==

Health effects of idling are related to engine exhaust, and include acute effects such as eye, throat, and bronchial irritation; nausea; cough, phlegm congestion; allergic or asthma-like respiratory response; increased risk for cardiac events; cancer, and chronic effects, such as bronchitis, decreased lung function, damage to reproductive function (low birth weight and damage to sperm chromatin and DNA).&lt;ref&gt;Calogero A.E. et al. Environmental car exhaust pollution damages human sperm chromatin and DNA. [[Journal of Endocrinological Investigation]] (2011). 34;E139-E143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). (2002) Health assessment document for diesel engine exhaust. Prepared by the National Center for Environmental Assessment, Washington, DC, for the Office of Transportation and Air Quality; EPA/600/8-90/057F. Available from: National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA; PB2002-107661, and &lt;http://www.epa.gov/ncea&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;HEI Panel on the Health Effects of Traffic-Related Air Pollution. (2010) Traffic-Related Air Pollution: A Critical Review of the Literature on Emissions, Exposure, and Health Effects. HEI Special Report 17. Health Effects Institute, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

These health effects are more damaging in those with preexisting heart disease, asthma, or other lung problems.  Children are also more susceptible, due to their faster breathing rate and the fact that their respiratory system is still developing.  Idling pollutants also disproportionately affect the elderly, who have limited physiological reserve to compensate for the adverse effects of the pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hcdoes.org/airquality/anti-idling/bushealth.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies to reduce idling ==
Effort has been made to reduce the amount of time engines spend idling, chiefly due to [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] and [[exhaust gas|emissions]] concerns, although some engines can also be damaged if kept idling for extended periods.  In the United States, about a billion gallons (3.8 billion liters) of fuel is consumed by idling heavy-duty truck and locomotive engines each year.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).  [http://www.epa.gov/smartway/transport/what-smartway/idling-reduction.htm "Idling Reduction."]  ''SmartWay Transport''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many newer semi-trucks have small [[auxiliary power unit]]s (APUs) to run accessories more efficiently while the truck is parked.  [[Hybrid vehicle]]s typically shut down their [[internal combustion engine]]s while stopped, although some conventional vehicles are also including [[start-stop system]]s to shut off the engine when it would otherwise idle.

At the macro level, governments can implement strategies to reduce reliance on motorised transport, including investing in public transport and implementing transit-oriented development.

==Anti-idling legislation ==
===Canada===

The city of [[Toronto]] enacted the first idling bylaw (No. 673-1998 Chapter 517 in the Municipal Code) in [[Canada]] in 1996 to reduced idle time to 3 minutes for vehicles and marine vessels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/life/health/article/76026--city-health-officials-consider-beefing-up-anti-idling-bylaw|City Health Officials Consider Beefing Up Anti-Idling Bylaw&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toronto.ca/transportation/onstreet/idling.htm  Idling Control By-law&lt;/ref&gt; There are plans by the health department to ask the bylaw to be amended to a limit of one minute and no exemptions to the city's fleet, including the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] buses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/life/health/article/76026--city-health-officials-consider-beefing-up-anti-idling-bylaw City Health Officials Consider Beefing Up Anti-Idling&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hong Kong ===
In a bid to reduce air pollution, the Hong Kong Government enacted the Motor Vehicle Idling (Fixed Penalty) Ordinance from December 2011. The law prohibits drivers from idling for more than three minutes in any 60-minute period. Both police traffic wardens and inspectors of the [[Environmental Protection Department]] can fine offenders HK$320.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motor Vehicle Idling (Fixed Penalty) Ordinance|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/4f0db701c6c25d4a4825755c00352e35/B3CE1E5CED7F155F4825785000535DAC/$FILE/CAP_611_e_b5.pdf|website=Bilingual Laws Information System|publisher=Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

Both the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency have programs in place to reduce idling. The DOE is funding research and development for alternative and advanced vehicles, which includes the gathering of quantitative data on medium-duty trucks, examining idling reduction alternatives, and the CoolCab project for semi-truck curtains and installation.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of  Energy. Alternative and advanced vehicles. (2011) http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/idle_reduction_research.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA's programs include the Environmental Technology Verification Program,&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency. Environmental technology verification program.(2012) http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/std/etv/center-apc.html&lt;/ref&gt; the Smart Way Transport Partnership (freight incentives), the Model State Idling Law (diesel) and Clean School Bus USA.&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency. Smart way.(2011) http://www.epa.gov/smartway/basic-info/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

All but 11 states have at least one incentive or law in place to reduce idling, while 7 states have at least four.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of  Energy. Idle reduction incentives and laws. (2011) http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/idle_reduction_laws.html&lt;/ref&gt; The state of Colorado has in place a tax credit for alternative fuel and qualified idle reduction technologies, as well as the Green Truck Grant Program which allows the Governor's Energy Office to provide reimbursement of up to 25% of costs to owners of commercial trucks used in interstate commerce to reduce emissions.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of  Energy. Colorado incentives and laws for idle reduction. http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/progs/ind_state_laws.php/CO/IR&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many local ordinances and programs to discourage idling, such as ordinances limiting the minutes per hour in which a vehicle can idle.&lt;ref&gt;Denver the Mile High City. Idling vehicles. (2011) http://www.denvergov.org/OutdoorAirQuality/SmokingIdlingVehicles/tabid/424914/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a local program is Denver, Colorado's Engines Off! citywide anti-idling campaign, which aims to improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting voluntary behavior change in idling behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Engines off! Denver. Engines off! Denver. (2008) http://enginesoff.com/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[international community]] considers the establishment of [[Israeli settlements]] in the [[Israeli-occupied territories]] illegal under international law, because of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] of 1949 which states: "The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Prolonged Military Occupation: The Israeli-Occupied Territories Since 1967|last=Roberts|first=Adam|author-link=Adam Roberts (scholar)|journal=The American Journal of International Law|volume=84|issue=1|publisher=American Society of International Law|pages=85–86|quote=The international community has taken a critical view of both deportations and settlements as being contrary to international law.

This policy has also been justified in terms of security interests, taking into consideration the dangerous geographic circumstances of Israel before 1967 (where Israeli areas on the Mediterranean coast were potentially threatened by Jordanian control of the West Bank ridge).

==Background==
Shortly after independence, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the fundamental principles of international law, accepted as binding by all civilized nations, were to be incorporated in the domestic legal system of Israel.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;see the "Place of customary international law" on pages 5–6 of [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1290714 International Law in Domestic Courts: Israel, by Dr. David Kretzmer] and Chapter 2 "Application of International Law", in [https://books.google.com/books?id=_Thjg-0dut0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=%22%22&amp;source=gbs_book_citations_r&amp;cad=1_0#PPA31,M1 The Occupation of Justice, by David Kretzmer]&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israel [[military occupation|occupied]] the Sinai Peninsula, the Gaza Strip, [[Israeli-occupation of the West Bank|West Bank]] and Golan Heights. Immediately after the war, the Israeli government authorised the construction of military settlements for security purposes. They were built on the fringes of the territories, along the Jordanian and Syrian frontiers and along the edges of the Sinai Peninsula.&lt;ref name="Gelvin2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=James L. Gelvin|title=The Israel-Palestine conflict: one hundred years of war|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5FwAT5fx03IC&amp;pg=PA188|accessdate=9 December 2010|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88835-6|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Israel conveyed that it was willing in principle to return most of the newly captured territory.&lt;ref name="Inc1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=Time Inc|title=LIFE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5FMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=9 December 2010|date=12 March 1971|publisher=Time Inc|page=32|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukacs1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yehuda Lukacs|title=Israel, Jordan, and the Peace Process|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mv8R-o_b0acC&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate=9 December 2010|date=September 1999|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-2855-2|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Levi Eshkol]] offered to return the territories with only minor border modifications. Nevertheless, with government permission granted, [[Kfar Etzion]] was re-established in September 1967, becoming the first civilian settlement to be built in the West Bank. During the 1970s, Israel's Supreme Court regularly ruled that the establishment of civilian settlements by military commanders was legal on the basis that they formed part of the territorial defense network and were considered temporary measures needed for military and security purposes.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Yvonne Schmidt|title=Foundations of Civil and Political Rights in Israel and the Occupied Territories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=51gNA4Go_lUC&amp;pg=PA361|accessdate=18 December 2010|date=May 2008|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-638-94450-2|pages=361–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Likud came to power in 1977, using land on the basis of the 1907 Hague Regulations, which implied a temporary nature of Israeli presence, was not employed anymore as the new government declared land in the West Bank "state land".&lt;ref name="Schmidt2008"/&gt;

In 1978 and 1979 the Israeli Supreme court, prompted by the new government policies, ruled on two important cases that set out the requirements for Israeli settlement legality under international law. In Ayauub ''et al.'' vs. Minister of Defence (the Beit-El Toubas case), the Court determined that the Hague Conventions but not the Geneva Conventions could be applied by Israeli courts on land and settlement issues in the occupied territories. The following year the Court ruled on Dwikat ''et al.'' vs. the Government of Israel (the [[Elon Moreh]] case), outlining the Hague Conventions' limitations on Israeli land acquisition and settlements. Settlements, whether on private or public land, could not be considered permanent, nor could the land be permanently confiscated, only temporarily requisitioned. Settlements on private land were legal only if determined to be a military necessity; the original owner retained title to the land and must be paid rental fees for its use. Public lands' "possession cannot be alienated, nor its basic character transformed".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4326305 "Israel and the West Bank after Elon Moreh: The Politics of De Facto Annexation"] Ian Lustick&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, an advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice concluded that Israel had breached its obligations under international law by establishing settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and that Israel cannot rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of imposing a régime, which is contrary to international law. The Court also concluded that the Israeli régime violates the basic human rights of the Palestinians by impeding the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception of Israeli citizens) and their exercise of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;See the Judgment in "Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory", para 120, 134, and 142 {{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706021237/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-06 |df= }} and PAUL J.

==Status of the territories==
{{further|Status of territories occupied by Israel in 1967}}
Although all areas in question were captured by [[Israel]] in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israel has treated them in three different ways:
* "[[East Jerusalem]]"—[[Jerusalem]] and its surroundings were envisioned as an [[corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|international area under United Nations administration]] in the 1947 partition plan, which was accepted by [[Yishuv|the Jewish public]] but rejected by all Arab nations. In 1948, [[Jordan]] captured and annexed the eastern half of Jerusalem, while Israel captured and annexed the west. Following the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel annexed the eastern part, together with several villages around it. In 1980 the Israeli Knesset passed the [[Jerusalem Law]] stating that "Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel".
* The Israeli [[Golan Heights Law]] of 1981 applied Israel's "laws, jurisdiction and administration" in the [[Golan Heights]], captured from Syria in 1967.  The public viewed the move as an annexation, but the law itself refrained from using the term officially.
* The [[Gaza Strip]] and [[West Bank]] form part of the areas offered by the UN to a prospective Arab state of Palestine in the Partition Plan, which was rejected by the Arabs. From 1948 until 1967, The Gaza Strip was [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|occupied by Egypt]] and the West Bank was annexed by [[Jordan]]. Together with the annexation of East Jerusalem mentioned above, [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordan's annexation of the West Bank]] was not recognized internationally. Since 1967, the West Bank has been under [[military occupation]]. Gaza was also occupied in 1967, but after [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Israel's unilateral disengagement in 2005]] the status has become disputed, with conflicting opinions on whether or not the occupation has ended.

The [[Jerusalem Law]] and the [[Golan Heights Law]] have both been deemed illegal by the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] (resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478|478]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 497|497]] respectively), and are not recognized by the international community. The [[United States]] abstained from the vote on Resolution 478 and the U.S. Congress (which does not define U.S. foreign policy&lt;ref name=USTRANSCRIPT /&gt;) passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]],&lt;ref name=USTRANSCRIPT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1079/is_v84/ai_3369221/pg_2/?tag=content;col1|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|website=findarticles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

Israel has signed peace treaties with Egypt (removing all Israeli settlements and returning the [[Sinai Peninsula]] to Egyptian sovereignty), and Jordan (returning small sections to Jordanian sovereignty); there are currently no peace treaties governing Israel's borders related to the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights. Israel therefore asserts that the armistice lines (known as the Green Line) of 1949 have no other legal status.

Palestinians object to this view as the [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]] was not to alter the status of any territories coming under Israeli control during the hostilities of 1967 (article 3(2) of the Israel–Jordan peace treaty).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/jordan_treaty.htm |title=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/jordan_treaty.htm |accessdate= |work= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827032618/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/jordan_treaty.htm# |archive-date=2009-08-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International legal opinions==
At present, based on the result of numerous UN resolutions that cite Article 49 of the Geneva Convention, the consensus view of the [[international community]] is that Israeli settlements are illegal and constitute a violation of international law.&lt;ref name=Playfair1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Albin2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibney1999/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_GC4"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1682640.stm |title=The Geneva Convention |date=2004-08-24 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;"The view that the fourth Geneva Convention is applicable, and should be applied, in all the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 has been very widely held internationally.

In 1979 and 1980, numerous UN Security council resolutions, including [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 446|446]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 452|452]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 465|465]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 471|471]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 476|476]], considered the settlements as having "no legal validity" under the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/documents/sc/res/1980/scres80.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427050621/http://www.un.org/documents/sc/res/1980/scres80.htm# |archive-date=2013-04-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Security Council Resolution 2334, approved in December 2016 reaffirms the settlements lack of legal validity, and terms them "a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-State solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2004, an advisory opinion by the primary judicial organ of the UN, the [[International Court of Justice]], also found the settlements to be illegal under international law.&lt;ref name="icj-cij.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706021237/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-06 |df= }} paragraphs 95–101 and 120&lt;/ref&gt; The court's finding was based on the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention and [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] resolutions that condemned the establishment of settlements and attempts by Israel to alter the demographics of the territories under its control.

An opinion by a legal adviser to the [[U.S. Department of State]] found the settlements contrary to international law in 1978.

====Israel====
The Israeli government's essential position is that rather than being "occupied territory," the West Bank is "disputed territory." Given that the Arab states prevented the formation of the sovereignty proposed by the 1947 partition resolution, Jordan's subsequent unrecognized annexation of the West Bank in 1950, as well as the fact that there has never been a Palestinian sovereignty in that territory, it has been posited that there is no legally recognized claim to who has sovereignty over the West Bank. Moreover, since the League of Nations Mandate for Palestine, with the intent to form a Jewish state between the sea and the Jordan river, included the area now known as the West Bank, Israel has at least as legitimate claim to the territory as any other state or group.
Under the views of Howard Grief and others, according to Article 6 of The Anglo-American Treaty of 1924, Jewish Settlements are not illegal. The rights granted to and guaranteed by Mandate for Palestine survived the League of Nations and the Anglo-American Treaty of 1924 still has the force of law pursuant to Article 80 of the UN Charter by virtue of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Laws of Treaties.
Under this reasoning the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits forced population transfers, something that Israel is not engaged in since Jewish settlers move to the disputed territories on an individual, voluntary basis.  
In 1967, [[Theodor Meron]], legal counsel to the Israeli Foreign Ministry stated in a legal opinion to Adi Yafeh, the Political Secretary of the Prime Minister, "My conclusion is that civilian settlement in the [[administered territories]] contravenes the explicit provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gershom Gorenberg|Gorenberg, Gershom]]. "The Accidental Empire". New York: Times Books, Henry Holt and Company, 2006. p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The legal opinion, forwarded to [[Levi Eshkol]], was not made public at the time, and the Labor cabinet progressively sanctioned settlements anyway; this action paved the way for future settlement growth. In 2007, Judge Meron stated that "I believe that I would have given the same opinion today."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Macintyre, {{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/secret-memo-shows-israel-knew-six-day-war-was-illegal-450410.html |title=''Secret memo shows Israel knew Six Day War was illegal'' |accessdate=2008-06-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611213726/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/secret-memo-shows-israel-knew-six-day-war-was-illegal-450410.html |archivedate=June 11, 2008 |df= }}. Independent, 26 May 2007. (on web.archive)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Israel considers its settlement policy to be consistent with international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention, while recognizing that some of the smaller settlements have been constructed "illegally" in the sense of being in violation of Israeli law.&lt;ref&gt;

Retrieved 29 Jan, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 the Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs produced "The International Criminal Court Background Paper".&lt;ref&gt;30th July 1998, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs produced "The International Criminal Court Background Paper" http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/mfaarchive/1990_1999/1998/7/the%20international%20criminal%20court%20-%20background%20pape, accessed 2007-05-13&lt;/ref&gt; It concludes&lt;blockquote&gt;International law has long recognised that there are crimes of such severity they should be considered "international crimes". Such crimes have been established in treaties such as the Genocide Convention and the Geneva Conventions.... The following are Israel's primary issues of concern [ie with the rules of the ICC]: – The inclusion of settlement activity as a "war crime" is a cynical attempt to abuse the Court for political ends. The implication that the transfer of civilian population to occupied territories can be classified as a crime equal in gravity to attacks on civilian population centres or mass murder is preposterous and has no basis in international law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Israel also argues that some of the settlements are built in areas where Jewish settlements existed before the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] and violence prior, when many West Bank settlements were destroyed and the residents massacred or expelled, such as [[Hartuv]], [[Kfar Etzion]], [[Hebron]], and the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]] of [[Jerusalem]], and therefore the application of the Geneva Convention is an entirely different issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1378577 The Economist.

Some argue that according to international law Israel is the custodian of absentee property in the West Bank and may not give it to settlers. In 1997 the Civil Administration's legal adviser gave his opinion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Custodian of Absentee Property in the West Bank is nothing but a trustee looking after the property so it is not harmed while the owners are absent from the area ... the custodian may not make any transaction regarding the asset that conflicts with the obligation to safeguard the asset as stated, especially his obligation to return the asset to the owner upon his return to the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Akiva Eldar |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-effectively-annexes-palestinian-land-near-jordan-valley-1.396225 |title=Israel effectively annexes Palestinian land near Jordan Valley |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=18 November 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Israel contends that the Geneva Convention only applies in the absence of an operative peace agreement and between two powers accepting the Convention. Since the [[Oslo Accords]] leave the issue of settlements to be negotiated later, proponents of this view argue that the Palestinians accepted the temporary presence of Israeli settlements pending further negotiation, and that there is no basis for declaring them illegal.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1378577 | work=The Economist | title=Double standards | date=2002-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Helmreich&gt;Helmreich, Jeffrey.

Israel has justified its civilian settlements by stating that a temporary use of land and buildings for various purposes appears permissible under a plea of military necessity and that the settlements fulfilled security needs.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Kretzmer, David "The occupation of justice: the Supreme Court of Israel and the Occupied Territories, SUNY Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7914-5337-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-5337-7}}, page 83&lt;/ref&gt; It is further argued that [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]] calls for "secure and recognized boundaries", and that neither the 1949 armistice demarcation lines, nor the 1967 cease-fire lines have proved themselves secure.&lt;ref name="Blum_Secure"&gt;{{cite book |title=Secure Boundaries and Middle East Peace |pages=63–79 |author=[[Yehuda Blum]] |year=1971 |publisher=Hamakor Press |location=Jerusalem, Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated that the settlements were being developed consistently with international law and that they did not violate any agreements with either the Palestinians or Jordan. They added that the settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were recognised as legitimate by the Mandate for Palestine adopted by the [[League of Nations]], and that the only administration that completely prohibited Jewish settlement was that of Jordan from 1948 to 1967. Regarding the Geneva Convention, they maintained that the Israeli government was not forcibly transferring its population into the territories. Neither had the land that was being settled been under the legitimate sovereignty of any state beforehand. It further highlighted that no clauses in the Convention could be used to prohibit the voluntary return of individuals to towns and villages from which they or their ancestors had been previously ejected by forcible means. It claimed the settlements had only been established after exhaustive investigations making sure none were built on private land.&lt;ref name="Mahler2004"/&gt;

====Canada====
[[Canada]], agreeing with UN Security Council Resolutions 446 and 465, argues that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to the occupied territories (the Golan Heights, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip) and that Israeli settlements are a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Policy on Key Issues in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/name-anmo/peace_process-processus_paix/canadian_policy-politique_canadienne.aspx?lang=eng|publisher=[[Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal arguments==

===Fourth Geneva Convention===
There are two disputes regarding the Fourth Geneva Convention: whether the convention applies to the territories in question and whether the Convention forbids the establishment of Israeli settlements. Article 2 concerns the applicability of the Convention whereas article 49 concerns the legality of population transfers.

====Article 2====
Article 2 extends the Convention to "all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties" and "all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party".&lt;ref name=4GC&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/6756482d86146898c125641e004aa3c5 Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.] Geneva, 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Endorsement=====
The applicability of the fourth Geneva Convention to "all the territories occupied by Israel in 1967" is held with "a remarkable degree of unanimity" among international actors.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; In a 2004 advisory opinion to the [[UN General Assembly]], the [[International Court of Justice]] stated that Article 2 of the Convention applied to the case of Israel's presence in the territories captured during the 1967 war. It stated that Article 2 applies if there exists an armed conflict between two contracting parties, regardless of the territories' status in international law prior to the armed attack. It also argued that "no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal" according to [[customary international law]] and defined by "Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations" (General Assembly Resolution 2625).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf ''Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706021237/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf |date=2010-07-06 }}, International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion, July 9, 2004, paragraphs 95 and 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

At their July 1999 Conference, the States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention issued a statement in which they "reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem". In December 2001, the [[High contracting party|High Contracting Parties]] to the Convention reaffirmed the "applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestiniari Territory, including East Jerusalem". They further reminded the contracting parties, the parties to the conflict and the state of Israel as the occupying power, of their obligations under the Convention.&lt;ref name=ICJ2004&gt;{{cite book|title=Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Advisory Opinion, I.

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] in a declaration of December 2001 stated that "the ICRC has always affirmed the ''[[de jure]]'' applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied since 1967 by the state of Israel, including East Jerusalem".&lt;ref name=ICJ2004/&gt;

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] has affirmed the applicability of the Convention to the [[Palestinian Territories]] in many resolutions. The [[United Nations Security Council]] has taken the same view. Security Council resolution 271 (1969) called upon "Israel scrupulously to observe the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international law governing military occupation". Security Council resolution 446 (1979) affirmed "''once more'' that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including Jerusalem".&lt;ref name=ICJ2004/&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of Israel]] in a ruling of 30 May 2004 declared, "the military operations of the [Israeli Defence Forces] in Rafah, to the extent they affect civilians, are governed by Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907 ... and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949."&lt;ref name=ICJ2004/&gt; A further June 2004 Israeli Supreme Court ruling concerning the [[West Bank]] stated that "the point of departure of all parties – which is also our point of departure – is that Israel holds the Area in [[military occupation|belligerent occupation]] (''occupatio bellica'')" and that the military commander's authority is "anchored in IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949".&lt;ref name=ILAC&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael Schmitt|first=Jelena Pejic|title=International Law and Armed Conflict: Exploring the Faultlines (International Humanitarian Law Series)|date=15 August 2007|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-04-15428-0|page=511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BietSourik&gt;{{cite web|title=Beit Sourik Village Council v. 1.The Government of Israel 2.Commander of the IDF Forces in the West Bank|url=http://elyon1.court.gov.il/Files_ENG/04/560/020/A28/04020560.A28.HTM|publisher=The Supreme Court Sitting as the High Court of Justice|accessdate=8/5/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Rejection=====
The official Israeli legal argument against the application of Article 2 to the situation in the West Bank is based on a 1971 interpretation by Israeli Attorney-General, [[Meir Shamgar]].&lt;ref name=Kretzmer2002/&gt; His view was presented by [[Moshe Dayan]] in a speech before the 32nd session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1977.&lt;ref name=Slonim&gt;Slonim, S.

URL accessed May 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the argument, the last legal sovereignty over the territories was that of the League of Nations Palestine Mandate, which stipulated the right of the Jewish people to settle in the whole of the Mandated territory. According to Article 6 of the Mandate, "close settlement by Jews on the land, including State lands not required for public use" was to be encouraged. Article 25 allowed the League Council to temporarily postpone the Jewish right to settle in what is now Jordan, if conditions were not amenable. Article 80 of the U.N. Charter preserved this Jewish right to settlement by specifying, "nothing in the [United Nations] Charter shall be construed ... to alter in any manner the rights whatsoever of any states or peoples or the terms of existing international instruments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&amp;x_outlet=36&amp;x_article=259|title=BACKGROUNDER:  Jewish Settlements and the Media - CAMERA|website=www.camera.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shamgar further stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no rule of international law according to which the Fourth Convention applies in each and every armed conflict whatever the status of the parties.... The whole idea of the restriction of military government powers is based on the assumption that there has been a sovereign who was ousted and that he was a legitimate sovereign. Any other conception would lead to the conclusion, for example, that [[France]] should have acted in [[Alsace-Lorraine]] according to rule 42–56 of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)#Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Rules of 1907]], until the signing of a peace treaty.&lt;ref name=Slonim/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Israeli legal argument was dismissed by the International Court of Justice. The Court cited the Geneva Convention's ''[[travaux préparatoires]]'', which recommended that the conventions be applicable to any armed conflict "whether [it] is or is not recognized as a state of war by the parties" and "in cases of occupation of territories in the absence of any state of war"  as confirmation that the drafters of the article had no intention of restricting the scope of its application.&lt;ref name=ICJ2004/&gt; {{efn|Ambassador Morris Abram, who was involved in drafting the Fourth Geneva Convention, argued that the convention "was not designed to cover situations like Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, but rather the forcible transfer, deportation or resettlement of large numbers of people."&lt;ref name="jcpa.org"/&gt;}}

====Article 49====
Article 49 (1) states &lt;blockquote&gt;Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.&lt;ref name=4GC/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 49 (6) states &lt;blockquote&gt;The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.&lt;ref name=4GC/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Jean Pictet]] of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], this clause intended to prevent the [[World War II]] practice of an occupying power transferring "portions of its own population to occupied territory for political and racial reasons or in order, as they claimed, to colonize those territories", which in turn "worsened the economic situation of the native population and endangered their separate existence as a race".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Pictet|Pictet, Jean]] (ed.)

=====Endorsement=====
U.S. State Department Legal Advisor, Herbert J. Hansell, in a letter dated 1 April 1978, concluded that although Article 49 (1) prohibits ''forcible'' transfers of protected persons out of the occupied territory, "paragraph 6 is not so limited."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

He argued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The view has been advanced that a transfer is prohibited under paragraph 6 only to the extent that it involves the displacement of the local population. Although one respected authority, [[Elihu Lauterpacht|Lauterpacht]], evidently took this view, it is otherwise unsupported in the literature, in the rules of international law or in the language and negotiating history of the Convention, and it seems clearly not correct. Displacement of protected persons is dealt with separately in the Convention and paragraph 6 would seem redundant if limited to cases of displacement. Another view of paragraph 6 is that it is directed against mass population transfers such as occurred in World War II for political, racial or colonization ends; but there is no apparent support or reason for limiting its application to such cases.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ths interpretation was adopted by the International Court of Justice in its 2004 advisory opinion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf ''Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706021237/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf |date=2010-07-06 }}, International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion, July 9, 2004, paragraph 120.&lt;/ref&gt; and 150 countries supported a non-binding General Assembly resolution demanding Israel to "comply with its legal obligations as mentioned in the advisory opinion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/f3b95e613518a0ac85256eeb00683444?OpenDocument|title=http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/f3b95e613518a0ac85256eeb00683444?OpenDocument|accessdate=|format=|work=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517152912/http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/f3b95e613518a0ac85256eeb00683444?OpenDocument|archivedate=2006-05-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Kretzmer, Professor of International Law at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, has argued that it is "quite clear that by actively organizing or encouraging transfer of its own population into the occupied territory, an occupying power does indeed violate Article 49(6)".&lt;ref&gt;Kretzmer, David. [http://www.lex.unict.it/STIPIL2008/documenti/David%20Kretzmer_The%20Advisory%20Opinion.pdf "The Advisory Opinion: The Light Treatment of International Humanitarian Law"] in ''American Journal of International Law'' Vol.99 No. 1 (Jan., 2005), pp. 88–102, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Rejection=====
Those who reject the application of Article 49 to the situation in the Israeli-held territories argue that even if the Convention did apply, it should be read only in the context of the [[World War II]] forcible migrations. It is only intended to cover ''forcible'' transfers and to protect the ''local population'' from displacement:
*Article 49 (1) specifically covers "individual or mass forcible transfers", whereas the Israelis who live in the settlements have moved there voluntarily.
*Article 49 (6) only applies when the transfer of the Occupying Powers civilian population involves the displacement of the local population, whereas the Israeli settlements are not intended to, or have ever resulted in, the displacement of Palestinians from the area.&lt;ref name="Rostow1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfa"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lacey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dann/&gt;&lt;ref name=Einhorn/&gt;

In addition, they state that the Geneva Convention only applies in the absence of an operative peace agreement and between two powers accepting the Convention. Since the [[Oslo Accords]] leave the issue of settlements to be negotiated later, proponents of this view argue that the Palestinians accepted the temporary presence of Israeli settlements pending further negotiation, and that there is no basis for declaring them illegal.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;&lt;ref name="Helmreich"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lacey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Einhorn/&gt;

====Application====
In July 1999, the conference of the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention ruled that the Convention did apply in the Israeli-occupied territories.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations (2002).

(PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the conference called upon "the Occupying Power to fully and effectively respect the Fourth Geneva Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to refrain from perpetrating any violation of the Convention." The High Contracting Parties reaffirmed "the illegality of the settlements in the said territories and of the extension thereof".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList325/D86C9E662022D64E41256C6800366D55 Implementation of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied Palestinian territories: history of a multilateral process (1997–2001)], ''International Review of the Red Cross'', 2002 – No. 847.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, some argued that the conference had amended history and had construed the Convention only for this specific situation.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} According to barrister and human rights activist Stephen Bowen, arguments dismissing the ruling as applying to more specific cases were rejected "because the Convention also states that it applies 'in all circumstances' (Article 1), and 'to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict' (Article 2)".&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, Stephen (1997). ''Human Rights, Self-Determination and Political Change in the Occupied Palestinian Territories''. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers. {{ISBN|90-411-0502-6}}, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, Israel does not accept that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies ''de jure'', but has stated that on humanitarian issues it will govern itself ''de facto'' by its provisions, without specifying which these are.&lt;ref name="Gerson, Allan 1978, p. 82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts, Adam 1988 pp. 345-359"/&gt;

===Arguments based on UNSC Resolution 242 and the British Mandate===
Rostow and others further argue that [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|UN Security Council Resolution 242]] (which Rostow helped draft) mandates Israeli control of the territories, and that the original [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] still applies, allowing Jewish settlement there.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Helmreich/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rostow2&gt;[[Eugene V. Rostow|Rostow, Eugene]]. [http://www.tzemachdovid.org/Facts/islegal1.shtml Resolved: are the settlements legal? Israeli West Bank policies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915102140/http://www.tzemachdovid.org/Facts/islegal1.shtml |date=2008-09-15 }}, ''[[The New Republic]]'', October 21, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In Rostow's view &lt;blockquote&gt;The British Mandate recognized the right of the Jewish people to "close settlement" in the whole of the Mandated territory. It was provided that local conditions might require Great Britain to "postpone" or "withhold" Jewish settlement in what is now Jordan. This was done in 1922. But the Jewish right of settlement in Palestine west of the Jordan river, that is, in Israel, the West Bank, Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, was made unassailable. That right has never been terminated and cannot be terminated except by a recognized peace between Israel and its neighbors. And perhaps not even then, in view of Article 80 of the U.N. Charter, "the Palestine article", which provides that "nothing in the Charter shall be construed ... to alter in any manner the rights whatsoever of any states or any peoples or the terms of existing international instruments...."&lt;ref name=Rostow2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; According to Rostow "the Jewish right of settlement in the area is equivalent in every way to the right of the local population to live there".&lt;ref&gt;''American Journal of International Law'', 1990, volume 84, page 72&lt;/ref&gt;

This right is based on Article 6 of the Mandate, which states: "The Administration of Palestine, while ensuring that the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced, shall facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions and shall encourage, in cooperation with the Jewish Agency referred to in Article 4, close settlement by Jews on the land, including State lands not required for public use". In addition, many Israeli settlements have been established on sites that were home to Jewish communities before 1948 such as [[Neve Yaakov]], [[Gush Etzion]], [[Hebron]], [[Kalia, Israel|Kalia]], and [[Kfar Darom]].

Contrary to this view other legal scholars have argued that under Articles 31 and 32 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] the only common sense interpretation of UNSC 242 is that Israel must withdraw from all of the territory captured in 1967, as any interpretation permitting the extension of sovereignty by conquest would violate the relevant governing principle of international law as emphasized in the preambular statement, i.e., "the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war" as established through the abolition of the right of conquest by the [[League of Nations]] following [[World War I]].

Furthermore, it is argued that UNSC 242 has binding force under Article 25 of the UN Charter owing to its incorporation into [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|UN Security Council Resolution 338]] and that it is also binding on Israel and the PLO by agreement owing to its incorporation into the Oslo Accords.&lt;ref name=McHugo&gt;McHugo, John (2002). Resolution 242: A Legal Interpretation of the Right-Wing Israeli Interpretation of the Withdrawal Phrase With Reference to the Conflict Between Israel and the Palestinians. ''International and Comparative Law Quarterly'', 51, 851–882.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that the Oslo Accords supersede UNSC 242 rather than making it binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middle-east-info.org/gateway/unitednations/Israel%20and%20Iraq%20-%20UN%20Double%20Standards.pdf |title=Double standards |website=www.middle-east-info.org |format=PDF}} &lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration of Principles in the accords only state that future negotiations will "lead to the implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycentral.com/Israel/Documents/Oslo.html|title=Oslo Accord&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, as the international community considered the status of Jerusalem to be unresolved, even after 1967, and did not deem any part of the city to be Israeli territory, including that part held since 1948, UNSC 242 did not settle territorial issues between Israel and Palestine left unresolved by the 1949 Armistice Agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, John (2002). Palestine: The Issue of Statehood (pp. 37–54). In Silverburg, Sanford R. (Ed.). ''Palestine and International Law: Essays on Politics and Economics''. McFarland &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-7864-1191-0}}, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Sir Elihu Lauterpacht and others have argued that, because of the disorder in Palestine at the time, the territorial framework of the 1947 Partition Plan did not come into effect in such a way as to [[ipso jure]] grant Israel sovereignty over the territory allocated to the Jewish state under that plan.&lt;ref name=McHugo/&gt; Stone agrees with Lauterpacht's analysis, and his view that sovereignty was acquired through other means:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Lauterpacht has offered a cogent legal analysis leading to the conclusion that sovereignty over Jerusalem has already vested in Israel. His view is that when the partition proposals were immediately rejected and aborted by Arab armed aggression, those proposals could not, both because of their inherent nature and because of the terms in which they were framed, operate as an effective legal re-disposition of the sovereign title. They might (he thinks) have been transformed by agreement of the parties concerned into a consensual root of title, but this never happened. And he points out that the idea that some kind of title remained in the United Nations is quite at odds, both with the absence of any evidence of vesting, and with complete United Nations silence on this aspect of the matter from 1950 to 1967?... In these circumstances, that writer is led to the view that there was, following the British withdrawal and the abortion of the partition proposals, a lapse or vacancy or vacuum of sovereignty. In this situation of sovereignty vacuum, he thinks, sovereignty could be forthwith acquired by any state that was in a position to assert effective and stable control without resort to unlawful means.&lt;ref name=Lacey/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Antonio Cassese]] disagrees with this analysis, arguing that although Israel's original occupation of West Jerusalem might have been carried out in an act of self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter, this did not confer legal title to the territory owing to the general prohibition in international law on the [[acquisition of sovereignty]] through military conquest. He further considers that "mere silence" could not constitute agreement by the United Nations to the acquisition of sovereignty by Israel or Jordan as a result of their ''de facto'' control of Jerusalem. Cassese concludes that "at least ''a tacit manifestation of consent through conclusive acts would have been necessary''", whereas such relevant acts as did take place confirmed that no such consent to the transfer of sovereignty was given.&lt;ref&gt;Cassese, Antonio (1986). Considerations on the International Status of Jerusalem (pp. 13–40). In Kassim, A. F. ''The Palestine Yearbook of International Law 1986''. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers. {{ISBN|90-411-0340-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments based on the cause of the war===
It has been argued that Israel took control of the West Bank as a result of a ''defensive war''. Former Israeli diplomat [[Dore Gold]] writes that: &lt;blockquote&gt;The language of "occupation" has allowed Palestinian spokesmen to obfuscate this history. By repeatedly pointing to "occupation", they manage to reverse the causality of the conflict, especially in front of Western audiences. Thus, the current territorial dispute is allegedly the result of an Israeli decision "to occupy", rather than a result of ''a war imposed on Israel'' by a coalition of Arab states in 1967.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He quotes Former State Department Legal Advisor Stephen Schwebel, who later headed the International Court of Justice in the Hague, and wrote in 1970 regarding Israel's case: &lt;blockquote&gt;Where the prior holder of territory had seized that territory unlawfully, the state which subsequently takes that territory in the lawful exercise of self-defense has, against that prior holder, better title.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, international law scholar [[John Quigley (academic)|John Quigley]] has written, "... a state that uses force in self-defense may not retain territory it takes while repelling an attack. If Israel had acted in self-defense, that would not justify its retention of the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Under the UN Charter there can lawfully be no territorial gains from war, even by a state acting in self-defense. The response of other states to Israel's occupation shows a virtually unanimous opinion that even if Israel's action was defensive, its retention of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was not."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Quigley (academic)|John Quigley]], ''The Case for Palestine'', 2005, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments based on property rights and private ownership===
On January 30, 2009, the [[Associated Press]] reported that Israeli political group [[Yesh Din]] plans to use a classified Israeli Government database to prove that many [[West Bank]] [[Israeli settlements]] were built on land privately owned by Palestinian citizens without compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2009/01/30-4 | title = Group: Settlement info implicates Israeli gov't | author = Matti Friedman | agency = Associated Press | date = January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unauthorized or illegal outposts==
{{See also|Sasson Report}}

In two cases decided shortly after independence (the Shimshon and Stampfer cases) the Israeli Supreme Court held that the fundamental rules of international law accepted as binding by all "civilized" nations were incorporated in the domestic legal system of Israel. The Nuremberg Military Tribunal had already determined that the articles annexed to the Hague IV Convention of 1907 were customary law, recognized by all civilized nations.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;

The Court determined in the 1979 Elon Moreh case that only the military commander of an area may requisition land according to [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague04.asp#art52 article 52 of the Hague regulations]. Military necessity had been an afterthought in the planning portions of the Elon Moreh settlement. That situation did not fulfill the precise strictures laid down in the articles of the Hague Convention, so the Court ruled the requisition order had been invalid and illegal.&lt;ref&gt;see page 349 of [https://books.google.com/books?id=-QL8LsEpbuoC&amp;pg=PA347&amp;lpg=PA347&amp;dq=&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ddBYIVW_4_&amp;sig=qEemf94wdDtnxqAxNFoHUfGRnyc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hqziSfKvHurqnQeAn_mmAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#PPA349,M1 Israel Yearbook on Human Rights Volume 9, 1979, By Yoram Dinstein]&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent cases, the Court has ruled that Article 43 of the Hague IV Convention is a mandatory planning consideration for approval of building projects on state lands in the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;see for example, the Ja'amait Ascan case on pages 68–69 of [https://books.google.com/books?id=_Thjg-0dut0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=&amp;source=gbs_book_citations_r&amp;cad=1_0#PPA68,M1 Kretzmer's The Occupation of Justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressured by America, the [[Ariel Sharon|Sharon]] administration commissioned the [[Sasson Report]], which found that the Israeli government had funded the creation of Jewish settler outposts in the West Bank that were unauthorized and in violation of stated government policy. According to the report, the Housing and Construction Ministry, the [[World Zionist Organization]], the Education Ministry and the Defense Ministry cooperated to "systematically establish illegal settlement points", paying millions of dollars to create the infrastructure for scores of settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE2DF163CF93AA35750C0A9639C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=Israeli Report Condemns Support for Settlement Outposts |first=Steve |last=Erlanger |date=2005-03-09 |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1128/p07s04-wome.html |publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |title=Israeli court rebukes state over illegal outposts |date=2008-11-28 |first=Joshua |last=Mitnick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The summary of the Sasson Report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmo.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/4F5F5333-7EFF-4081-988B-024133357752/0/sassons.doc Summary of the Sasson Report], available from the Prime Minister of Israel's Communications Office&lt;/ref&gt; explains that local law requires the fulfillment of a number of basic conditions before establishing a settlement in Judea and Samaria. It lists four preconditions that must be fulfilled in each case. The second precondition regarding title to the land cites the precedent established in the Elon Moreh case. The third precondition is that a settlement can only be established according to a lawfully designed building scheme, which has the power to produce a building permit. The fourth precondition is that the bounds of jurisdiction of the settlement must be determined in advance by order of the Commander of the area. The Israeli Supreme Court has ruled that the fulfillment of the applicable Hague IV Convention criteria is a mandatory and integral part of satisfying those three preconditions of the local law. Sasson summed up the situation by explaining:&lt;blockquote&gt;An unauthorized outpost is a settlement which does not fulfill at least one of the above mentioned conditions. And I must emphasize: an unauthorized outpost is not a "semi legal" outpost. Unauthorized is illegal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report found "blatant violations of the law" by officials and state institutions. Many of the more than 100 outposts investigated added at state expense paved roads, permanent housing, power lines and other infrastructure. According to the report, some of the outposts were established on private lands owned by Palestinians with the help of Housing Ministry architects, the Housing Ministry funded many of the trailers used to start the outposts, and Defence Ministry officials allocated such private land to the quasi-official [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;March 8, 2005, Financial Times of London, "Israeli Report Hits at Funding for Settlements, http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/67ba9b06-8ff9-11d9-9a51-00000e2511c8,stream=FTSynd,s01=2.html?nclick_check=1&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the 2003 [[Road map for peace|"Road map" for peace]], Israel committed itself to remove about two dozen such settlements, an obligation it has yet to fulfill.&lt;ref name="christiansciencemonitor1"&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1128/p07s04-wome.html|title=Israeli court rebukes state over illegal outposts|first=Joshua|last=Mitnick|date=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to [[Israeli settler violence|settler violence]] directed towards Israeli security forces, Israel declared it would no longer fund unauthorized outposts from November 2008. Settlers claim the violence was sparked by the beating of a settler child; border police spokesman Moshe Pinchi said he had no knowledge of the alleged beating and accused the settlers of "cynically" sending minors to attack the police.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel cuts aid to outposts over settler violence|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=2009-10-03 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/11/03/2408502.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is evidence that support continues unabated for illegal outposts. At one unauthorized settlement, [[Eli, Mateh Binyamin|Eli]], there has been recent work on a new road that cuts through Palestinian territory.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |title=New support for West Bank outpost movement |first=Tim |last=Franks |publisher=BBC |date=2009-03-26 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7965503.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report of the Israeli Environmental Protection Ministry, waste water management is "virtually nonexistent" in unauthorized Jewish settler outposts and some other settlements, thus raw sewage is contaminating the ground water in parts of the West Bank. According to the report, the main cause of the contaminated water is that raw waste water flows from Hebron, Ramallah, Nablus, Jenin and other villages, without proper treatment. The report blames Israeli settlements for pumping contaminated water into the sewers, not Palestinian villages. 70% of the Jewish communities east of the Green Line are connected to treatment facilities, so "illegal outposts" are the main source of the untreated water, according to the Israeli report.&lt;ref&gt;October 1, 2008, Maan News Agency, "Israel: 'Illegal outposts' Contaminating West Bank Water Supplies" http://www.maannews.net/en/index.php?opr=ShowDetails&amp;ID=32268&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Defense Minister Ehud Barak said that over two dozen illegal outposts in the West Bank had been "declared as such by the Talia Sasson Commission", and would be dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/printarticle.aspx?id=143263 |title=PM: No new West Bank settlements |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |author=Herb Keinon |date=2009-05-24 |accessdate=2017-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, 2009, four members of Netanyahu's cabinet — [[Deputy leaders of Israel#Deputy Prime Minister|Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Internal Affairs Minister of Israel|Minister of Internal Affairs]] [[Eli Yishai]] ([[Shas]]), [[Israeli Vice Prime Minister|Vice Prime Minister]] and [[Strategic Affairs Minister of Israel|Minister of Strategic Affairs]] [[Moshe Ya'alon]] ([[Likud]]), [[Information and Diaspora Minister of Israel|Minister of Information]] [[Yuli Edelstein]] ([[Likud]]), and [[Science and Technology Minister of Israel|Minister of Science and Technology]] [[Daniel Hershkowitz]] ([[The Jewish Home]]) — embarked on a tour of West Bank outposts. During the tour, Yishai stated that the outposts are not illegal:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3763086,00.html |title=Yishai says outposts not illegal |last=Weiss|first=Efrat |date=2009-08-17 |website=[[Ynetnews]] |accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/printarticle.aspx?id=152059 |title=Ministers urge PM to legalize outposts |date=2009-08-17 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=2017-01-09 |author=Tovah Lazaroff }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The people of Israel should know that these settlements [outposts] are legal. If someone thinks otherwise and plans to evacuate them, it will have to be approved by the cabinet. You cannot just evacuate people from their homes without due process.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During ''[[TechCrunch Disrupt]]'' on September 11, 2013 Zuckerberg elaborated further on his vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/11/everybody-wants-to-be-connected-thats-why-were-here/|title=Zuckerberg’s Manifest Destiny: Connecting The 5 Billion People Without Internet|last=Constine|first=Josh|date=September 11, 2013|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TechCrunch]] blog compared Internet.org with Google's [[Project Loon]].&lt;ref name="launch-techcrunch" /&gt; Zuckerberg also released a video on September 30, 2013 explaining Internet.org's goal of making the Internet 100 times more affordable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57605378-93/zuckerberg-lets-make-the-internet-100x-more-affordable/|title=Zuckerberg: Let's make the Internet 100x more affordable: Working with his Internet.org partners, Facebook's CEO outlines what needs to be done to drop the cost of Web access worldwide.|last=Kerr|first=Dara|date=September 30, 2013|publisher=[[CNet]]|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 2014, shortly before a keynote presentation by Zuckerberg at the [[Mobile World Congress]] in [[Barcelona]] on February 24, 2014, Internet.org unveiled several new projects: an education partnership called SocialEDU with [[Nokia]] and local carrier [[AirTel]], [[edX]], and the government in [[Rwanda]]; a project with [[Unilever]] in India; and a new Internet.org Innovation Lab with [[Ericsson]] in its [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]] HQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/24/facebook-led-internet-org-partners-with-nokia-on-socialedu-in-rwanda-unilever-in-india-ericsson-on-new-lab-to-connect-developing-economies/|title=Facebook-Led Internet.org Partners With Nokia On SocialEDU In Rwanda, Unilever In India, Ericsson On New Lab To Connect Developing Economies|last=Lunden|first=Ingrid|date=February 24, 2014|publisher=''[[TechCrunch]]''|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presentation, Zuckerberg says that [[Facebook]]'s recent acquisition of mobile messaging app [[WhatsApp]] for $19 billion was closely related to the Internet.org vision.&lt;ref name="techcrunch-whatsapp-io"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/24/whatsapp-is-actually-worth-more-than-19b-says-facebooks-zuckerberg/|title=WhatsApp Is Actually Worth More Than $19B, Says Facebook’s Zuckerberg, And It Was Internet.org That Sealed The Deal|last=Lunden|first=Ingrid|date=February 24, 2014|publisher=''[[TechCrunch]]''|accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/web/mark-zuckerberg-whatsapp-is-worth-more-than-19-billion-1227925|title=Mark Zuckerberg: WhatsApp is worth more than $19 billion|last=Fitzsimmons|first=Michelle|date=February 24, 2014|publisher=''[[Techradar]]''|accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/zuckerberg-talks-whatsapp-internet-access-for-all/2014/02/24/5c54226c-9d84-11e3-878c-65222df220eb_story.html|title=Zuckerberg takes long view with WhatsApp, Internet|date=February 24, 2014|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Mobile World Congress]] March 2015, Mark Zuckerberg says that the Internet.org initiative was "willing to work" with [[Project Loon]] (Google's project to use high-altitude balloons to provide people cheaper Internet access) but emphasizes that in his view, the real work is in partnering with existing telecommunications companies to improve access and reduce costs for people already within range of a network, which he estimates at over 80% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/02/and-connectivity-for-all/|title=Zuck Says "Sure", Facebook Would Love To Work With Google On Global Internet Access|last=Constine|first=Josh|date=March 2, 2015|publisher=''[[TechCrunch]]''|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zuck-disses-loon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/mark-zuckerberg-shuns-googles-project-loon-to-focus-on-real-work-20150303-13t9ii.html|title=Mark Zuckerberg shuns Google's Project Loon to focus on 'real work'|last=Ramli|first=David|date=March 3, 2015|publisher=''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Net neutrality criticism in India ===
The first Internet.org summit was held on 9 October 2014 in [[New Delhi]], India. The primary objective of this summit was to bring together experts, officials and industry leaders to focus on ways to deliver more Internet services for people in languages other than English. Zuckerberg also met Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] to talk about how Facebook and the Indian government can collaborate on Internet.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/141008/technology-latest/article/mark-zuckerberg-visit-india-tomorrow-meet-pm-narendra-modi|title=Mark Zuckerberg to meet PM Narendra Modi tomorrow|date=October 9, 2014|publisher=''[[Deccan Chronicle]]'' (via PTI)|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india.com/top-n/mark-zuckerberg-to-meet-narendra-modi-schedule-of-the-internet-org-summit-168252/|title=Mark Zuckerberg to meet Narendra Modi: Schedule of the Internet.org summit|date=October 9, 2014|publisher=India.com|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/facebook-ceo-in-india-key-highlights-of-the-modi-zuckerberg-meeting-237342.html|title=Facebook CEO in India: Key highlights of the Modi-Zuckerberg meeting|publisher=FirstPost (via PTI)|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-addresses-the-first-internetorg-summit-in-new-delhi-to-meet-pm-modi-on-october-10/504908-11.html|title=Mark Zuckerberg addresses the first Internet.org summit in New Delhi; to meet PM Modi on October 10|date=October 9, 2014|publisher=IBNLive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Mark Zuckerberg wrote in an article for ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' stating that Internet.org and net neutrality can co-exist and Internet.org will never differentiate between services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/technology-topstories/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-to-ht-net-neutrality-and-universal-connectivity-must-co-exist/article1-1337766.aspx|title=Mark Zuckerberg to HT: Net neutrality and universal connectivity must co-exist|last=Zuckerberg|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Zuckerberg|date=April 17, 2015|publisher=''[[Hindustan Times]]''|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His claims were contested by many response articles, including one published in the ''Hindustan Times''.&lt;ref name="tech.firstpost.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/internet-org-is-just-a-facebook-proxy-targeting-indias-poor-263778.html|title=Internet.org is just a Facebook proxy targeting India’s poor|last=Murthy|first=Mahesh|date=April 17, 2015|publisher=FirstPost|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/technology-topstories/mr-zuckerberg-facebook-is-not-and-should-not-be-the-internet/article1-1337944.aspx|title=Dear Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook is not, and should not be the internet|date=April 17, 2015|publisher=''[[Hindustan Times]]''|author=SaveTheInternet.in coalition|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, the Internet.org Platform, open to participation by any developers meeting specified guidelines, was announced. Some commentators viewed this announcement as a response to the net neutrality concerns expressed.&lt;ref name="platform-announce-tc" /&gt;
The [[Prime Minister's Office (India)|PMO]] has expressed displeasure at Facebook's reaction to and handling of TRAI's consultation paper, calling it a crudely majoritarian and orchestrated opinion poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/pmo-displeased-with-facebooks-reaction-to-trais-consultation-paper/articleshow/50842057.cms|title=PMO displeased with Facebook's reaction to Trai's consultation paper|date=February 4, 2016|publisher=''[[The Economic Times]]''|author=Anandita Singh Mankotia|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Indian journalist, in his reply to Mark Zuckerberg's article defending Internet.org in India, criticized Internet.org as "being just a Facebook proxy targeting India's poor" as it provides restricted Internet access to Reliance Telecom's subscribers in India.&lt;ref name="tech.firstpost.com" /&gt; Until April 2015, Internet.org users could access (for free) only a few websites, and Facebook's role as gatekeeper in determining what websites were in that list was criticised for violating [[net neutrality]]. In May 2015, Facebook announced that the Free Basics Platform would be opened to websites that met its criteria.&lt;ref name="platform-announce-tc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developers.facebook.com/docs/internet-org/faq#addservice|title=Free Basics - FAQ - Documentation - Facebook for Developers|website=Facebook Developers|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, some Indian startups start pulling out of Internet.org to protect [[net neutrality]].&lt;ref name="nn-verge"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/15/8423075/indian-startups-leave-facebook-internet-org-net-neutrality|title=Indian startups are pulling out of Facebook's Internet.org to protect net neutrality.

TRAI accused Facebook of failing to pass on the four questions in the regulator's consultation paper and also blocking access to TRAI's designated email for feedback on Free Basics.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/trai-slams-facebook-letter-on-free-basics-campaign-wholly-misplaced/|title=Facebook ‘I support Free Basics’ campaign is wholly misplaced, says TRAI|date=21 January 2016|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=21 January 2016|author=Tech Desk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/21/facebook_india_free_basics_net_neutrality_dispute_escalates/|title=India just about accuses Facebook of faking Free Basics fandom|date=21 January 2016|publisher=The Register|accessdate=21 January 2016|author=Simon Sharwood}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2016, TRAI banned the Free Basics service in India based on "Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016" notification.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On February 11, 2016 Facebook withdrew the Free Basics platform from India.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Facebook-withdraws-the-controversial-Free-Basics-platform-from-India/articleshow/50947427.cms|title=Facebook withdraws the controversial 'Free Basics' platform from India|date=11 February 2016|publisher=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Expanding Internet access===

An article published on ''[[Datamation]]'' in August 2013 discussed Internet.org in relation to past accessibility initiatives by Facebook and Google such as [[Facebook Zero]], [[Google Free Zone]], and [[Project Loon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datamation.com/mobile-wireless/facebook-and-google-we-need-a-bigger-internet.html|title = Facebook and Google: "We're Going to Need a Bigger Internet"|publisher = Datamation|date = August 21, 2013|last = Elgan|first = Mike|accessdate = January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet.org and Project Loon have been described as being engaged in an Internet space race.&lt;ref name="drone-vs-loon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/131699-the-internet-space-race-is-on-google-loon-vs-facebook-drones-vs-spacex-satellites|title=The internet space race is on: Google Loon vs Facebook drones vs SpaceX satellites|last=Edwards|first=Luke|date=March 27, 2015|publisher=Pocket Lint|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/03/05/in-the-race-between-google-and-facebook-over-global-connectivity-everyone-is-winning/|title=In the race between Google and Facebook over global connectivity, everyone is winning|last=O'Brien|first=Chris|date=March 5, 2015|publisher=''[[VentureBeat]]''|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2855979/why-google-and-facebook-need-balloons-drones-and-rockets.html|title=Why Google and Facebook need balloons, drones and rockets|last=Elgan|first=Mike|date=December 6, 2014|publisher=''[[ComputerWorld]]''|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been technical debates about the relative feasibility and value of using balloons (as championed by Project Loon) instead of drones,&lt;ref name="drone-vs-loon" /&gt; with [[Mark Zuckerberg]] favoring drones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/03/28/drones-vs-balloons-zuckerberg-explains-why-wings-are-better-for-the-internet-than-helium/|title=Drones vs. balloons: Zuckerberg explains why wings are better for the internet than helium|date=March 28, 2014|publisher=''[[GigaOm]]''|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, [[David Talbot]] wrote a detailed article for ''[[Technology Review]]'' titled ''Facebook's Two Faces: Facebook and Google Aim to Fix Global Connectivity, but for Whom?'' about Internet.org and other Internet accessibility initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/review/522671/facebooks-two-faces/|title = Facebook's Two Faces|last = Talbot|first = David|authorlink = David Talbot|date = December 17, 2013|accessdate = January 8, 2014|publisher = ''[[Technology Review]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===User experience research===

In 2015, researchers evaluating how Facebook Zero shapes ''information and communication technologies'' (ICT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ictworks.org/2014/08/29/is-facebook-zero-the-future-of-public-internet-access/ |title= Is Facebook Zero the Future of Public Internet Access |first= Maria |last= Andersen |date= Aug 29, 2014 |publisher= ICT Works }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ictworks.org/about/ |title= ICT Works |quote= Resource for sharing and expanding knowledge on appropriate information and communication technologies (ICT) and the implementation processes that can make them sustainable in rural and underserved communities across the developing world }}&lt;/ref&gt; usage in the developing world found that 11% of Indonesians who said they used Facebook also said they did not use the Internet. 65% of Nigerians, and 61% of Indonesians agree with the statement that "Facebook is the Internet" compared with only 5% in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet/|title=Millions of Facebook users have no idea they’re using the internet|author=Leo Mirani|date=9 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japanese competition law''' consists of the {{Nihongo|'''Antimonopoly Act'''|独占禁止法|Dokusen Kinshihō|"AMA"}}, officially the {{Nihongo|'''Act on Prohibition of Private Monopolization and Maintenance of Fair Trade'''|私的独占の禁止及び公正取引の確保に関する法律|Shiteki-dokusen no Kinshi oyobi Kōseitorihiki no Kakuho ni Kansuru Hōritsu|Act No. 54 of April 14, 1947}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jftc.go.jp/e-page/legislation/index.html |title=Legislation and Guidelines |author=Fair Trade Commission |accessdate=December 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322190634/http://www.jftc.go.jp/e-page/legislation/index.html |archivedate=March 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and several other statutory laws.

The AMA was introduced during the postwar Allied [[Occupation of Japan|occupation]]. The [[U.S. Government]], on 6 September 1945, issued a [[presidential directive]] instructing the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] (SCAP) to dissolve [[Zaibatsu]] structures. Prior to [[World War II]], [[Japan]] had no [[antitrust law]]s. There were seventeen Zaibatsu organisations, the four largest of which had controlled approximately a fourth of all of the paid-up capital in the Japanese economy just prior to the World War.

In opposition to General MacArthur's fear that Zaibatsu dissolution would lead to instability, the U.S. Departments of State and Justice sent a "Special Mission on Japanese Combines" to Japan for the implementation of a comprehensive antimonopoly framework. In response, MacArthur coerced the [[Japanese Diet]] into adopting legislation known as the Antimonopoly Act (AMA), with the persuasion to them that enforcement was optional.

==Antimonopoly Act==
MacArthur's AMA, which is still Japan's fundamental competition law, generalised prohibitions against three types of anticompetitive conduct.
*private monopolization
*unreasonable restraints of trade and
*unfair methods of competition.

The AMA led to the formation of [[Fair Trade Commission (Japan)|Japan's Fair Trade Commission]] (JFTC).

==Relaxation of the Act==
The weakness of the AMA was due to vagueness requiring JFTC officials to be familiar with presumptions built into [[United States antitrust law|American antitrust laws]]. Seeing the need for stability and the growing threat of [[Communism]], the [[United States]] backtracked on requiring Japan's enforcement of the AMA and instead encouraged the resurrection of Zaibatsu structures.

Japan, which had grown increasingly independent of the United States in the 1950s, succumbed to pressures from Japanese business and need for recovery from economic depression due to the end of the [[Korean War]]. The SCAP and the U.S. Government acquiesced to [[Shigeru Yoshida|Prime Minister Yoshida's]] actions to enact relaxations to the AMA when occupation of Japan ended with the implementation of the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] on 28 April 1952. All cartels illegal under the original AMA were effectively legalized.

==Strengthening of the Act==
Amendments were made to strengthen the AMA in the 1970s due to, in part, pressures from American businesses. The [[1973 oil crisis]] and price fixing by Japanese oil companies further garnered public opinion in Japan against the weakness of the AMA and its lack of enforcement. The new articles introduced authorised the JFTC to dissolve or divest a company based on barriers against market-entry, lack of price benefit for consumers and unreasonable profits. The JFTC was authorised to impose fines for violations of the AMA.

==Cartels still exist==
&lt;!-- see talk page --&gt;
However, the existence of [[cartel]]s known as [[keiretsu]] are still legalized with the following notes.
*Cartels calculate penalties beforehand and include such penalties as costs of business.
*Penalty calculations, which do not correlate with profits, present insufficient financial disincentives for businesses to collude.
*Courts in Japan lack [[Contempt of court|contempt powers]] to ensure compliance with the JFTC's cease and desist orders.

The '''Landsting''' was a house of the [[Rigsdag]] in Denmark from 1849 until 1953, when the [[bicameral]] system was abolished. The house had powers equal to the [[Folketing]], which made the two houses of parliament hard to distinguish.

Originally membership and the electorate was restricted, and the members were largely [[conservatism|conservatives]]. Membership of the house was then restricted to certain sectors of society: only males with a certain net worth could hold a seat. In 1915, these restrictions were removed, and a few new members were appointed by the existing members.

==History==
[[Image:Rigsretten i Landstingssalen 1877.jpg|thumb|left|The Danish court of Impeachment, ''Rigsretten'', during a session in the Landsting Chamber, Christiansborg Palace, 1877.]]
Under the [[Constitution of Denmark|Constitution of 1849]], the requirements for the right to vote was the same for the two houses, however the requirements for electability was stricter for the Landsting; candidates were limited to those of age 40 and above and they were required to have a substantial income.&lt;ref name=constitution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.um.dk/publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap1/1-9.asp |title=Official Denmark – Constitution |accessdate=21 January 2007 |last=Zahle |first=Henrik |date=May 2003 |work=Denmark |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark|Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110120220/http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap1/1-9.asp |archivedate=10 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The house originally had 51 members, all elected indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sekr.uvm.dk/historie/tekster_tidssoejle/tid_hist/dan_2_grund_48.html|title=Danmarks Riges Grundlov af 5. juni 1849|accessdate=21 January 2007|work=Danmarkshistorien|publisher=[[Ministry of Education of Denmark|Danish Ministry of Education]]|language=Danish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212021337/http://sekr.uvm.dk/historie/tekster_tidssoejle/tid_hist/dan_2_grund_48.html|archivedate=12 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voters elected a group of electors for each constituency, and the electors elected the members of the house. The members were elected for a term of eight years; however, half of the seats were up for election every four years.

With the Constitution of 1866, the electoral system was reformed. The number of seats was increased to 66 of which twelve were appointed by the king for a period of twelve years, and one by the [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] [[Løgting]].&lt;ref name=gjennemsete&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sekr.uvm.dk/historie/tekster_tidssoejle/tid_hist/dan_5_grund_66.html|title=Danmarks Riges Gjennemsete Grundlov af 5. juni 1849 som stadfæstet 28. juli 1866|accessdate=21 January 2007|work=Danmarkshistorien|publisher=[[Ministry of Education of Denmark|Danish Ministry of Education]]|language=Danish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319094830/http://sekr.uvm.dk/historie/tekster_tidssoejle/tid_hist/dan_5_grund_66.html|archivedate=19 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining 53 were elected indirectly. In [[Copenhagen]], half the electors were elected by the voters paying the largest amount of tax, the other half by all the voters. In the rest of the country, one elector was elected by the voters in each parish in the country and half as many electors were elected in the [[market town]] by the same system as in Copenhagen. Then for each elector elected in the country parishes and the market towns, one elector was found among those that paid the greatest amount of tax in the country parishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Engelstoft|first=Povl|editor=Bomholt, J. |editor2=Fabricius, K. |editor3=Hjelholt, H. |editor4=Mackeprang, M. |editor5=Møller A.

Schultz Forlag|location=Copenhagen|language=Danish|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the main direct tax of the time was based on real estate and its value as farmland, this system greatly favored manor owners. The result was a conservative majority lasting 35 years, until the [[Danish Landsting election, 1902|1902 election]].&lt;ref name=gjennemsete /&gt;

The next reform of the electoral system came with the Constitution of 1915, and the first election under this system was the [[Danish Landsting election, 1918|1918 election]]. Women were given the right to vote, the number of seats was increased to 72, the number of constituencies was reduced to seven, and the system of appointed members was replaced by 18 members elected by the resigning Landsting for a period of eight years.&lt;ref&gt;Engelstoft, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenkrantz&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenkrantz|first=Palle|title=Den danske regering og rigsdag 1903–1934|year=1934|publisher=Arthur Jensens Forlag|location=Copenhagen|language=Danish|pages=41, 407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a [[Danish constitutional referendum, 1939|1939 referendum]] that would have replaced the Landsting with another chamber—the Rigsting—and simplified the legislative process, failed due to a low voter turnout, the bicameral system and thereby the Landsting was abolished in a [[Danish constitutional and electoral age referendum, 1953|1953 referendum]].

==Etymology and earlier use==
[[File:Landstingssalen 2018a.jpg|thumb|The former Landsting chamber in [[Christiansborg Palace]] in 2018]]
Ting (old Norse: [[Thing (assembly)|þing]]) means [[Deliberative assembly|assembly]]. It first came into being during [[Viking]] times and was formed by the [[citizenship|freemen]] of the community. In those times it numbered a hundred men. Tings were necessary in the clan society of Northern Germany and [[Scandinavia]]. Inter-clan wars were resolved or prevented through the governance of the ting. It also served as the place for religious rites and trade negotiations.

==Early life==
Hyde was born in [[Boston]], the son of Elizabeth Sanford Hyde and [[Walter Lewis Hyde]]. He received an M.A. in [[comparative literature]] from the [[University of Iowa]] and a B.A. in [[sociology]] from the [[University of Minnesota]] after which there were many years of freelance work and odd jobs, before teaching writing in the 80s.

==Career==
Hyde taught writing at [[Harvard University]] (1983–1989); in his last year there, he directed the undergraduate writing program. From 1989 to 2001 he was the Luce Professor of Arts and Politics at [[Kenyon College]] in Ohio. Since 2006 he has served as the Richard L. Thomas Professor of Creative Writing at Kenyon, and a visiting fellow at Harvard's [[Berkman Center]].  He is also a Nonresident Fellow at the [[University of Southern California|USC]] [[Annenberg Center for Communication]].

===Awards===
Hyde's awards include an [[National Endowment for the Humanities|NEH]] Fellowship for Independent Study and Research (1979); three [[National Endowment for the Arts|NEA]] Creative Writing Fellowships (1977, 1982, 1987); a [[MacArthur Fellow]]ship (the "Genius" award) (1991); a residency at the [[Getty Center]], Los Angeles (1993–94); an "Osher Fellow"  at the [[Exploratorium]] in San Francisco (1998);&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.exploratorium.edu/memory/lewishyde.html Exploratorium Lewis Hyde biography].&lt;/ref&gt; a Lannan Literary Fellowship (2002); an [[American Council of Learned Societies]] Fellowship (2003); and a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship]] (2006).

==Works==
Hyde's popular works of scholarship, including the books ''[[The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property|The Gift]]'' (1983) and ''Trickster Makes this World'' (1998) have been widely praised by fiction writers, including [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Michael Chabon]], [[Jonathan Lethem]] and [[David Foster Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again| pages=67| author=David Foster Wallace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=Adam|title=David Foster Wallace and New Sincerity Aesthetics: A Reply to Edward Jackson and Joel Nicholson-Roberts|journal=Orbit: A Journal of American Literature|date=8 August 2017|volume=5|issue=5|page=16|url=https://www.pynchon.net/articles/10.16995/orbit.224/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Gift'' has also been cited as the inspiration for visual artist Jim Mott's [[Itinerant Artist Project]]. Robert Darnton in ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Hyde's latest book, ''Common as Air: Revolution, Art and Ownership'' ( Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2010), "an eloquent and erudite plea for protecting our cultural patrimony from appropriation by commercial interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/books/review/Darnton-t.html |title=A Republic of Letters |author=Robert Darnton |publisher=New York Times Sunday Book Review |date=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs''' is a [[Government of Nepal|governmental body]] of [[Nepal]] dealing with the management of the judicial administration, legal affairs and legislative activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=कानून, न्याय तथा संसदीय मामिला मन्त्रालय|url=http://www.moljpa.gov.np|publisher=Government of Nepal|accessdate=30 October 2017|language=Nepali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''Department of Law (कानून विभाग)'' was established in 1950 before being developed into a ministry in 1956. Two years later, the ministry's portfolio was adjusted for the first time, making it the ''Ministry of Government and Law (कानून तथा संसदीय प्रबन्ध मन्त्रालय)''. In 1961, it was again renamad into the ''Ministry of Law and Justice (कानून तथा न्याय मन्त्रालय)''. The term ''Parliamentary Affairs'' was added and dropped several times throughout the history of the ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=मन्त्रालयको परिचय|url=http://www.moljpa.gov.np/मन्त्रालयको-परिचय/|publisher=Government of Nepal|accessdate=30 October 2017|language=Nepali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 21st-century debates about [[animal welfare]] and [[animal rights]] can be traced back to the ancient world.

==Jainism==
{{Further|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
[[Jainism]], dating from the 6th century BCE, is the oldest religious philosophy which has advocated complete non-violence towards animals of all forms.  The concept of Ahiṃsā is so much intertwined with Jainism that it conjures up images of ascetics who cover their mouths and sweep the ground before them with small brushes to avoid injuring the most minuscule forms of life and Jain-owned animal sanctuaries where even the sickest, most deformed birds and beasts are protected and cherished.  Non-violence is of the top most priority in the basic set of [[Jainism#Principles and other beliefs|Principles of Jainism]].

==Ancient Greek Philosophy==
{{Further|Greek philosophy}}
[[File:Kapitolinischer Pythagoras adjusted.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Pythagoras]] (c. 580–c.500 BCE)]]
Psychologist [[Richard D. Ryder|Richard Ryder]], former Mellon Professor at [[Tulane University]] and chairman of the [[RSPCA]] in 1977, writes that it is in 6th century BCE Greek philosophy that we first find concern for the treatment of animals.&lt;ref name=Ryder17&gt;Ryder, Richard. ''Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism''. Berg, 2000, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four schools of thought were influential in [[ancient Greece]]: [[animism]], [[vitalism]], [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], and [[anthropocentrism]]. The philosopher and mathematician [[Pythagoras]] ( c. 580–c. 500 BCE) was the central figure within animism. He urged respect for animals, because he believed that humans and non-humans had the same kind of soul, one spirit that pervades the universe and makes us one with animals.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Steiner, ''Anthropocentrism and its Discontents: The Moral Status of Animals in the History of Western Philosophy''. University of Pittsburgh Press, 2005, at page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
The souls were indestructible, made of fire and air, and were [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] from human to animal, or vice versa, the so-called [[transmigration of the soul]]. He was a vegetarian, and was reportedly the first animal "liberationist," buying animals from the market in order to set them free.&lt;ref name="Ryder17"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor34&gt;[[Angus Taylor (philosopher)|Taylor, Angus]]. ''Animals and Ethics''. Broadview Press, 2003, p. 34.
* Also see Huffman, Carl. [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2006/entries/pythagoras "Pythagoras"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Winter 2006. Retrieved January 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Against these ideas, [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE) argued that non-human animals had no interests of their own, ranking far below humans in the [[Great Chain of Being]], or ''scala naturae'', because of their alleged irrationality.&lt;ref name=EB3&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007642/animal-rights Animal Rights]." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to attempt the creation of a taxonomical categorization and hierarchy of animals.  Aristotle perceived some similarities between humans and other species and developed a sort of "psychological continuum", recognising that human and non-human animals differ only by degree in possessing certain temperaments.&lt;ref name="Mark R. Fellenz 2007, p. 90"&gt;Mark R. Fellenz, ''The Moral Menagerie: Philosophy and Animal Rights''. University of Illinois Press, 2007, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he denied animals rationality and moral equality. "Plants are created for the sake of animals," he wrote, "and animals for the sake of men."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Francione, Gary. ''Animals, Property, and the Law''. Temple University Press, 1995, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle argued that humans were the “masters” in his created hierarchical structure based upon their rational powers.&lt;ref name="Mark R. Fellenz 2007, p. 90"/&gt; 

One of Aristotle's pupils, [[Theophrastus]], argued against eating meat on the grounds that it robbed animals of life and was therefore unjust. He argued that non-human animals can reason, sense, and feel just as human beings do.&lt;ref name=Taylor35&gt;[[Angus Taylor (philosopher)|Taylor, Angus]]. ''Animals and Ethics''. Broadview Press, 2003, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Theophrastus did not prevail, and it was Aristotle's position—that human and non-human animals exist in different moral realms because one is rational and the other not—that persisted largely unchallenged in the West for nearly two thousand years.

==The Bible and ancient Judaism==
{{Further|Tza'ar ba'alei chayim|Jewish vegetarianism}}
While the first chapter of [[Book of Genesis]] describes how God gave human beings dominion over animals, this is tempered throughout the [[Torah]] by injunctions to show kindness and to respect animals. Severing a limb from a live animal and eating it was forbidden (Genesis 9:4), cattle were to be rested on [[Biblical Sabbath]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 20:10; 23:12), a cow and her calf were not to be killed on the same day ([[Leviticus]] 22:28), a person had to feed his animals before himself ([[Deuteronomy]] 11:15), animal suffering had to be relieved (Deuteronomy 22:4), oxen treading the corn were not to be muzzled (Deuteronomy 25:4), [[Goat|kids]] were [[Kashrut|not to be cooked in their mother's milk]] (Deuteronomy 14:21), mother birds not to be disturbed while sitting on eggs (Deuteronomy 22:6-7), and oxen and asses not to be yoked together (Deuteronomy 22:10).  In the opening chapters of Genesis, human beings are not permitted to eat meat at all, though after [[Great Flood (Biblical)|the Flood]], meat-eating was permitted within certain limits.&lt;ref name=Ryder25&gt;Ryder, Richard. ''Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism''. Berg, 2000, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish oral tradition developed the principle of [[Tza'ar ba'alei chayim]], forbidding inflicting unnecessary pain on animals.  This concept was accepted by the Talmud (Bava Metzia 32b) as being a Biblical mandate. It is linked in the Talmud from the Biblical law requiring people to assist in unloading burdens from animals (Exodus 23:5).

The Seven Laws of Noah, or the [[Noahide Laws]], are a set of moral imperatives that, according to the Talmud, were given by God as a binding set of laws for the "children of Noah" – that is, all of humanity; the sixth law is: Do not eat of a live animal. This law is derived from Genesis 9:4, as interpreted in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 59a).

Compassion for animals is declared to have been the merit of [[Moses]] which made him the shepherd of his people (Exodus Rabbah 2), while [[Judah ha-Nasi]] saw in his own ailment the punishment for having once failed to show compassion for a frightened calf.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Encyclopedia,'' Volume 5, page 251&lt;/ref&gt;

The book of Genesis declares that God created humans in his own image, "saying to them, 'Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth and conquer it. Be masters of the fish of the sea, the birds of heaven and all living animals on the earth' "(Genesis 1.28).

==Ancient Christianity==
[[Image:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued in the 13th century that humans should be kind to animals to make sure that cruel habits do not carry over into our treatment of other human beings, an argument that remains influential.&lt;ref name=SingerHonderich/&gt;]]
[[Peter Singer]] argues that the Christian [[New Testament]] is devoid of injunctions to be kind, with [[Paul of Tarsus]] interpreting the Sabbath requirement, "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox as he treadeth the corn" as intended to benefit human beings. "Doth God take care for oxen? Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope." ([[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 9:9-10).{{cn|date=November 2015}}{{lopsided|date=November 2015}}

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] (354 – 430) argued that [[Jesus]] allowed the 2,000 [[Legion (demon)|Gadarene swine]] to drown to demonstrate that man has no duties to animals: "Christ himself shows that to refrain from the killing of animals and the destroying of plants is the height of superstition ..."&lt;ref&gt;Saint Augustine. ''The Catholic and Manichaean Ways of Life''. Gallagher, D.A. and Gallagher, I.J. (trans.) Boston University Press, 1966, p. 120, cited in Singer, Peter. ''Animal Liberation''. Random House, 1990, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] (c. 1225–1274) qualified Augustine's position, arguing that human beings should be charitable to animals only to make sure that cruel habits do not carry over into our treatment of other humans, or cause a financial loss to the animal's owner. "If in Holy Scripture there are found some injunctions forbidding the infliction of some cruelty toward brute animals ... this is either for removing a man's mind from exercising cruelty towards other men ... or because the injury inflicted on animals turns to a temporal loss for some man ..."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, Thomas. ''Summa Contra Gentiles, iii. 112, cited in Ryder, Richard D. ''Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes towards Speciesism''. Berg, 2000, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas' argument was later supported by a number of philosophers, including [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724 – 1804), and it underpinned much of the 19th and 20th centuries' animal protection legislation.&lt;ref name=SingerHonderich&gt;Singer, Peter. "Animals" in [[Ted Honderich|Honderich, Ted]] (ed). ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy, Oxford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Benthall&gt;Benthall, Jonathan. [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8322.2007.00494.x "Animal liberation and rights"], ''Anthropology Today'', volume 23, issue 2, April 2007, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Law professor [[Gary Francione]] has called it "legal welfarism," namely that the welfare of animals is viewed as important only insofar as it benefits human beings.&lt;ref name=FrancioneLaw&gt;Francione, Gary. ''Animals, Property, and the Law'', Temple University Press, 1995, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Roman thought==
Singer writes that animals, along with criminals and other undesirables, largely fell outside the Roman moral sphere. He quotes a description from the historian W.E.H. Lecky of the [[Ludi Romani|Roman games]], first held in 366 BCE:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[E]very variety of atrocity was devised to stimulate flagging interest. At one time, a bear and a bull, chained together, rolled in fierce combat across the sand ... Four hundred bears were killed in a single day under [[Caligula]] [12–41] ... Under [[Nero]] [37–68], four hundred tigers fought with bulls and elephants. In a single day, at the dedication of the [[Colosseum]] by [[Titus]] [39–81], five thousand animals perished. Under [[Trajan]] [53–117] ... lions, tigers, elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotami, giraffes, bulls, stags, even crocodiles and serpents were employed to give novelty to the spectacle ... So intense was the craving for blood, that a prince was less unpopular if he neglected the distribution of corn than if he neglected the games.&lt;ref&gt;Lecky, W.E.H. ''History of European Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne''. Vol. 1, Longmans, 1869, pp. 280-282, cited in Singer, Peter. ''Animal Liberation''. Random House, 1990, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meat eating was a status symbol, and animals were often cooked alive; Ryder writes that pigs were skewered alive on hot spits to improve the taste. He writes that there were nevertheless signs of tender feelings for animals in the poetry of [[Virgil]] (70–19 BCE), [[Lucretius]] (99–55 BCE), and [[Ovid]] (43 BCE–17). The statesman [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (4 BCE–65) was a vegetarian and said that he found the practice not only moral but delightful,&lt;ref name="Daniel A. Dombrowski 1984"&gt;Daniel A. Dombrowski, The Philosophy of Vegetarianism, 81 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; as were the philosophers [[Plutarch]] (46–120), [[Plotinus]] (205–270), and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (232–305). Porphyry wrote two tracts on the issue, ''De Abstinentia'' (On Abstinence) and ''De Non Necandis ad Epulandum Animantibus'' (On the Impropriety of Killing Living Beings for Food).&lt;ref name=Ryder19&gt;Ryder, Richard D. ''Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes towards Speciesism''. Berg, 2000, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch, who was Greek but lived in Rome, argued strongly against meat eating, seeing it as responsible for much of the cruelty in the world:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the sake of some little mouthful of flesh, we deprive a soul of the sun and light ... And then we fancy that the voices it utters and screams forth to us are nothing else but certain inarticulate sounds and noises, and not the ... entreaties ... of each of them ...&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch "Of eating of flesh," cited in Ryder, Richard D. ''Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes towards Speciesism''. Berg, 2000, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Concept of "ius"==
{{Further|Natural law|Natural rights|Roman law#Concepts}}
Legal philosopher [[John Finnis]] writes that the Romans gave us the concept of "''ius''", meaning what is right, just, or lawful, and it is from this concept that the idea of a "right" as a claim, an entitlement, an immunity, or a liberty, arose in the late-medieval to modern period. He writes that it remains unclear how the concept of ''ius'' developed into the idea of modern rights, but a key feature of the latter is that the relationship between persons is articulated from the perspective of the relationship's beneficiary, the holder of the right. This is an important idea in the development of the concept of animal rights, the essence of which is to view the relationship between human and non-human from the perspective of the animal as beneficiary, rather than from the perspective of the human, which is how most animal protection legislation is framed. The idea is that any wrong not only "deforms the agent," as Finnis writes of human beings, but also offends the victim's "fundamental equality."&lt;ref&gt;Finnis, John. "Natural rights" in Honderich, Ted. ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Oxford University Press, 1995. Note that, in this entry, Finnis discusses human rights only.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism and Buddhism==
[[File:Surabhi Cow Vrindavan.jpg|right|thumb|220px|A cow resting on a street in [[Vrindavan]], India, free to wander around.]]
{{Further|Ahimsa|Animals in Buddhism|Buddhist vegetarianism|Cattle in religion}}
Both [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] societies saw widespread vegetarianism from the 3rd century BCE, in line with ''[[ahimsa]]'', the doctrine of non-violence. Ryder writes that animals were thought to possess the same feelings as human beings, and several kings of ancient India built hospitals for sick animals. Human souls could be reborn as animals if they had behaved badly, with all souls regarded as part of the Supreme Being. Failing to observe the duty to care could lead to bad [[karma]], which increased the likelihood of returning as an animal next time round.&lt;ref name=Ryder21&gt;Ryder, Richard D. ''Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes towards Speciesism''. Berg, 2000, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{Further|Ḏabīḥah|Halal|Islam and animals}}
[[Muhammad]] (570–632) taught that it was permissible to kill animals, but to do so unnecessarily or with cruelty was forbidden. "If you must kill, kill without torture."&lt;ref&gt;Masri, Al-Hafiz Basheer Ahmad. ''Islamic Concern for Animals''. Athene Trust, 1987, cited in Ryder, Richard D. ''Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes towards Speciesism''. Berg, 2000, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw animals as having internal mental states. They should not be bound when being slaughtered, and should not be made to wait. To let an animal see you sharpen your knife is to kill it twice.&lt;ref name=Ryder23&gt;Ryder, Richard D. ''Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes towards Speciesism''. Berg, 2000, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polytheism==
Some varieties of [[Animism]], [[totemism]], [[Ethnic religion|religions of indigenous peoples]], [[paganism]] and many [[polytheism]] hold the belief that animals are spiritual beings, people practicing these belief systems have great respect towards the [[right to life]] of animals. &lt;ref&gt;Harvey, G. (2006). ''Animism: respecting the living world''. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4643">The '''National Clearinghouse for Science, Technology and the Law'''  at [[Stetson University College of Law]] is an organization that provides information sharing and professional development to forensic scientists, lawyers, judges, other legal professionals, law enforcement personnel, educators, and the general public. Sponsored by a grant from the [[National Institute of Justice]], NCSTL offers educational programs and a database of [[forensic]]-related information. Within the context of the promotion of justice based on sound science and technology, NCSTL focuses on raising awareness and fostering communication and understanding among the various parties interested in [[scientific evidence (law)| scientific evidence]] and expert testimony.

== Free Forensics Database ==
One of the primary purposes of NCSTL is to provide a resource that collects and tracks the latest available sources related to [[forensics]] and technology.  NCSTL scrutinizes and disseminates useful information in the form of a research database on the Internet that is free and available to the public.

The NCSTL database was first offered live to the public in February 2005. It collects and distributes bibliographic information on thousands of court decisions, pieces of legislation, legal and scientific publications, news and media features, websites and educational opportunities.  Using the database, researchers can choose to view all types of resources in all its forensic-related topics, or restrict to those topics or resource types of specific interest.  Individual records provide bibliographic information, as well as active URLs that link to full text whenever available.  Researchers can also take advantage of a feature that offers the ability to save favorite searches.  Materials found in the database are supported in hard copy in the NCSTL collection in [http://www.law.stetson.edu/lawlib Stetson Law Library].

== Educational Resources ==
In its continuing education efforts, NCSTL tries to raise awareness of the nature of good evidence practices.  NCSTL presents an annual lecture series on the Stetson Law School campus that has included presentations by noted forensic scientists such as Drs. [[Michael Baden]] and [[Henry Lee (forensic scientist)|Henry Lee]] about a wide variety of forensic topics, including forensic investigations.   Thus, through its continuing education efforts, NCSTL shares with the forensic science community and the public what good forensic science practices are.  NCSTL’s lecture series is not only free and open to the public, but is webcast and podcast live, as well as available archivally from the NCSTL website.  NCSTL is also developing continuing education programs for forensic scientists and attorneys.

NCSTL also offers educational opportunities to students.  As a program at [[Stetson University College of Law]], students can earn academic or pro bono credit by helping build the NCSTL database.  In addition, students at other universities are welcome to volunteer, and may be able to arrange earning credit at their own educational institutions.

The '''National Library of South Africa''' is the [[government agency|agency]] of the government of South Africa which maintains a [[national library]] of all published materials relating to the country.

==History==
In 1818, [[Lord Charles Somerset]], the Cape Colony's first civil Governor, issued a proclamation to control the wine trade, imposing a tax on wine brought into Cape Town for sale. The net proceeds would be used to form a Public Library which should "lay the foundation of a system, which shall place the means of knowledge within reach of the youth of this remote corner of the Globe," (presuming a globe hath corners) "and bring within their reach what the most eloquent of ancient writers has considered to be one of the first blessings of life, 'Home Education'."&lt;ref name="Coates, P. 2012"&gt;Coates, P. (2012). WAS THE SOUTH AFRICAN LIBRARY AN ATHENAEUM?. Quarterly Bulletin of the National Library of South Africa, 66(4), 11–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, South Africa's library development was bifurcated although the library in Cape Town was the original establishment.The most likely model for Cape Town's "Public Library" was the London Institution (established in 1805 in the style of an Athenaeum).&lt;ref name="Coates, P. 2012"/&gt;

The Library's first significant acquisition was the collection of Joachim Nicolaus von Dessin, who bequeathed his books to the Dutch Reformed Church in 1761 to serve as the foundation of a public library. In 1820 the board of trustees decided to donate the Dessinian Collection to the new library. Other notable donations followed over the years, among others Sir [[George Grey]] who when he left South Africa in 1861 presented the Library with his remarkable personal collection of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts and rare books. In 1873 the South African Public Library became a legal deposit library for the Cape Colony, and from 1916 it received all printed items published throughout the country. The Library continued as a legal deposit library until 1954, when this function was taken over by the City of Cape Town. From then on it began to develop its unique character as a national reference library devoted to research based on its extensive stock, with a concurrent name change in 1967 to the South African Library.&lt;ref name="nlsa.ac.za"&gt;National Library of South Africa: Where We Come From.  Retrieved from http://www.nlsa.ac.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=242&lt;/ref&gt;

Diplomat [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]] visited the library, then called the '''South African Library''' around 1833 and described it as "once the pride and boast of the colony." He noted that the library had approximately 10,000 volumes and called it a "highly creditable place."&lt;ref name=Roberts1&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Edmund|title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat|year=1837|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|location=New York|page=396|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/396/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The State Library===
The "Staats-Bibliotheek der Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek" (State Library of the South African Republic) came into being thanks to a donation of books from the Maatschappij der Nederlandsche Letterkunde. These books consisted of a complete library of Dutch works, mainly Dutch literature and language, to the Transvaal Republic's government. The first consignment of eight chests of books arrived in 1883, including a chest from the Dutch Bible Society. On 21 September 1887 the Transvaal government approved the constitution of the Staats-Bibliotheek. As Pretoria began to grow in size, there arose a need for a public library. The first Pretoria Public Library had opened its doors in 1878, but because of ongoing financial problems was closed down in 1890. In 1893 strong public support and a collection of 700 saw another public library arise, this time under the wing of the Staats-Bibliotheek and with the bookstock of the former Public Library. From that time onward until 1964, the State Library performed a dual role as public library and national library. The first national librarian, the Afrikaans poet [[Jan Celliers]], saw exchange agreements as a means of enriching the State Library's collections. The first exchange agreement was entered into in 1898 with the Smithsonian Institution of Washington in the United States. In terms of the agreement the State Library would receive all American official publications in exchange for two copies of each official publication of the South African republic. From the early thirties under the guidance of the visionary national librarian Matthew Stirling, the State Library began to develop the character of a central library for South Africa, taking on functions such as striving for a national library lending system and a centre for bibliographical information.&lt;ref name="nlsa.ac.za"/&gt;

==Modern consolidation==
[[File:Librería Nacional, Ciudad del Cabo, Sudáfrica, 2018-07-19, DD 09.jpg|thumb|Contemporary view of the entrance to the library in Cape Town.]]
Until 1 November 1999, for historical reasons, South Africa had two national libraries, the South African Library, founded in 1818, in Cape Town, and the State Library, founded in 1887, in Pretoria. In terms of South African legal deposit legislation, each of the national libraries was a legal deposit library, entitled to receive from the publishers a gratis copy of every book, serial, newspaper, government publication or other printed item published in South Africa. In South Africa legal deposit, in some form or another, dates back to 1842. As a result, extensive collections of material of great scholarly value have been built up in the former national libraries. During the 1990s the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology began a review of all legislation under its jurisdiction, including the National Libraries Act, No 56 of 1985. The Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology in 1996 appointed a Working Group on the National Libraries of South Africa to advise him on the future of the two national libraries. The most important recommendation of the Working Group was that the two national libraries be amalgamated to form a dual-site (Cape Town and Pretoria) national library, to be known as the National Library of South Africa.&lt;ref name="nlsa.ac.za"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sebe, J. (2009). "Foreword: Celebrating the tenth anniversary of the National Library of South Africa". ''Quarterly Bulletin of the National Library of South Africa'', 63 (3/4), 51–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation under the National Library Act===
The National Library of South Africa's core national library functions are described in Section 4 subsection 1 of the National Library Act, No 92 of 1998, and cover the following broad areas:

* to build up a complete collection of published documents emanating from or relating to South Africa; 
* to maintain and extend any other collections of published and unpublished documents with the emphasis on documents emanating from or relating to Southern Africa; 
* to promote the optimal management of collections of published documents held in South African libraries as a national resource; and to render a national bibliographic service and to act as the national bibliographic agency; 
* to promote optimal access to published documents, nationally and internationally; 
* to provide reference and information services, nationally and internationally; 
* to act as the national preservation library and to provide conservation services on a national basis; 
* to promote awareness and appreciation of the national published documentary heritage; and 
* to promote information awareness and information literacy.

An '''open border''' is a [[border]] that enables [[Freedom of movement|free movement]] of people between different jurisdictions with few or no restrictions on movement, that is to say lacking substantive [[border control]]. A border may be an open border due to a lack of legal controls or intentional legislation allowing free movement of people across the border (''[[de jure]]''), or a border may be an open border due to lack of adequate enforcement or adequate supervision of the border (''[[de facto]]''). An example of the former is the [[Schengen Agreement]] between most members of the [[European Economic Area]] ([[European Free Trade Area|EFTA]] and the [[European Union|EU]]). An example of the latter has been the [[Bangladesh-India border|border]] between [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]], which is becoming controlled. The term "open borders" applies only to the flow of people, not the flow of goods and services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populationenvironmentresearch.org/papers/Colemanmigration.pdf |format=PDF |title=International Union for the Scientific Study of Population : XXIV General Population Conference, Salvador da Bahia, Brazil : Plenary Debate no 4 |date=24 August 2001 |website=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2016-04-11 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801080227/http://www.populationenvironmentresearch.org/papers/Colemanmigration.pdf |archivedate=August 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and only to borders between political jurisdictions, not to mere boundaries of privately owned property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/open-border |title=Definition of "open border" - English Dictionary |website=dictionary.cambridge.org |accessdate=2017-09-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503193452/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/open-border |archivedate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open borders are the norm for borders between subdivisions within the boundaries of [[sovereign state]]s, though some countries do have controlled borders within the boundaries of the state (for example in the [[People's Republic of China]] between the mainland and the [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]). Open borders are also usual between member states of [[federation]]s (such as the [[United States of America]]), though again in some instances movement between member states may be controlled via an [[internal passport]] system. Federations and confederations typically maintain external border controls through a collective border control system, though they sometimes have open borders with other non-member states (particularly [[enclave]]s, such as [[Switzerland–European Union relations#Schengen Agreement|Switzerland and the European Union]]) through special international agreements.

Pervasive international border control is a relatively recent phenomenon in world history. In the past, many states had open international borders either in practice or due to a lack of any legal restriction. Many authors, such as [[John Maynard Keynes]], have identified the early 20th century and particularly [[World War I]] as the point when such controls became common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Economic Consequences of the Peace]] |last=Keynes |first=John Maynard |authorlink=John Maynard Keynes |year=1920 |publisher=Harcourt Brace |location=New York|chapter=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been sporadic attempts to promote global open borders as a viable policy option. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casey|first=John P.|date=2009|title=Open Borders: Absurd Chimera or Inevitable Future Policy?|url=|journal=International Migration|volume= 48 (5)|pages=14–62|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open borders quickly became popular after 1889.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The International Emigration Conference held in Rome in May 1924 stated that anybody has the right to immigrate to a different country if they wanted to.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Before the 1880s, migration to the United States was not fully controlled. During World War I it became easier for people to migrate from their country of origin to foreign countries.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} After World War II, countries were looking for many new workers, and Germany issued a guest work program to attract more people to work.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}  Later, in the 1970s to 1980s strict borders were reinstated in industrialized countries.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Currently, immigration is more restricted and harder for low-skilled and low-income people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Types of borders==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
To understand the arguments for and against open borders, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of the other types of borders available.  These are:

A '''conditionally open border''' is a border that allows movement of people across the border that meet a special set of conditions. This special set of conditions which limits the application of border controls that would normally otherwise apply could be defined by an international agreement or international law, or the special conditions could be defined by a regulation or law of the jurisdiction that the people are claiming the right to enter.  Conditionally open borders generally requires a claim to be submitted from the people who are proposing to enter the new jurisdiction stating why they meet the special conditions which allow entry into the new jurisdiction. The new jurisdiction may detain the people until their claim is approved for entry into the new jurisdiction, or they may release them into the new jurisdiction while their claim is being processed. Whenever a conditionally open border is allowed, a considerable effort is often required to ensure that border controls do not break down to such an extent that it becomes an open border situation. An example of a conditionally open border is a border of any country which allows movement of asylum seekers due to application of either the 1951 Refugee Convention or international law which allows people to cross a border to escape a situation where their lives are directly threatened or in significant danger. Another example is the border between [[Ireland (state)|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The two countries allow unrestricted movement of their own citizens, but in order to enjoy such movement across the [[Irish Sea]], those same citizens may be required to provide evidence at seaports and airports that they are UK or Irish nationals. These checks are by the police, not immigration officers. ({{As of|October 2018}}, there are no such controls on the highly porous [[Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border|land border between them]]).

A '''controlled border''' is a border that allows movement of people between different jurisdictions but places restrictions and sometimes significant restrictions on this movement. This type of border may require a person crossing this border to obtain a [[Visa (document)|visa]] or in some cases may allow a short period of visa free travel in the new jurisdiction. A controlled border always has some method of documenting and recording people movements across the border for later tracking and checking compliance with any conditions associated with the visa or any other border crossing conditions. A controlled border places limitations on what a person crossing the border can do in the new jurisdiction, this is usually manifested in limitations on employment and also it limits the length of time the person can legally remain in the new jurisdiction.  A controlled border often requires some type of barrier, such as a river, ocean or fence to ensure that the border controls are not bypassed so that any people wishing to cross the border are directed to authorized border crossing points where any border crossing conditions can be properly monitored.  Given the large scale movement of people today for work, holidays, study and other reasons a controlled border also requires internal checks and internal enforcement within the jurisdiction to ensure that any people who have entered the jurisdiction are in fact complying with any border crossing conditions and that they are not overstaying to reside illegally or as an undocumented resident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpri.org/orbis/5001/ting.immigrationnationalsecurity.pdf |title=Orbis &amp;#124; Foreign Policy Research Institute |publisher=Fpri.org |date=2014-05-08 |accessdate=2014-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most international borders are by legislative intent of the controlled border type.  However, where there is a lack of adequate internal enforcement or where the borders are land borders, the border is often controlled only on part of the border, while other parts of the border may remain open to such an extent that it may be considered an open border due to lack of supervision and enforcement.

A '''closed border''' is a border that prevents movement of people between different jurisdictions with limited or no exceptions associated with this movement.  These borders normally have fences or walls in which any gates or border crossings are closed and if these border gates are opened they generally only allow movement of people in exceptional circumstances. Perhaps the most famous example of an extant closed border is the [[Demilitarized Zone (Korea)|Demilitarized Zone]] between [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]]. The [[Berlin Wall]] could also have been called a closed border.

Borders can be open or and closed based on: entry status, entry duration, entry qualifications, entrant rights and obligations, and entry quotas.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Citizenship, borders, and human needs.|last=Smith|first=Rogers|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entry status refers to the occupation of someone when and if they are allowed to cross a border, whether they are a student, worker, soldier, immigrant. One’s status effects the chances of being permitted to cross a border. “Most states control border crossing by limiting the duration of any visit.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Entry qualifications are restrictions based on factors such as health, age, income, religion, race. “Many countries, including Canada and Singapore, will admit wealthy immigrants who can demonstrate an intention and capacity to invest in the country.” Entrants rights and obligations are the restrictions that will be placed on those who have already been permitted to cross a border: you must follow certain rules and regulations given by the government to be allowed to stay in that country. A government may allow you to take up residency but may not allow you to work, and those who are allowed to work may not be able to find work due to the restrictions and forms of employment allowed. Entry quotas are restrictions based on the amount of immigrants allowed across a border within a certain frame of time: if you meet all of the qualifications to cross a border, but the country you want to enter has already met its quota for allowing immigrants inside, you may still not be allowed to enter.

As seen from the examples below, there are differing degrees of "openness" of a border, the nature of which depends on whether or not there are physical [[passport control]]s in place (and enforced). Passport control by police or immigration officers may be in place on some kinds of border but citizens of the destination territory or participating territories are permitted to cross using at most an identity card without any further approval, restrictions or conditions. Examples of the most open type of border include the [[Schengen zone]] or the [UK/Ireland] [[Common Travel Area]], where transit across the inter-state frontiers are entirely uncontrolled,{{efn|{{As of|November 2018}}, because of [[Dublin Regulation|illegal onward migration]] from Africa and Asia, identity checks are being enforced at Italy's borders with France, Switzerland and Austria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/11/01/migrants-risk-their-lives-to-move-on-from-italy Migrants risk their lives to move on from Italy]{{snd}} [[The Economist]], 1 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;}} and third-country illegal immigration is controlled by internal policing as with any other kind of clandestine entry. Examples of near-open borders include the border between the Common Travel Area (on the one hand) and the Schengen Zone (on the other) which, despite having full passport control, is an internal EU border that EU citizens can pass freely without any conditions, other than an identity card. Non-EU nationals are subject to full passport and visa control measures at airports and some seaports. A hybrid of these two possibilities is the border between [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]] in the [[Union State]] which lacks any physical control but formally foreigners are not permitted to use an uncontrolled crossing.

==Political debate==
The modern debate around open borders is not clearly delineated into the traditional [[Left-right political spectrum]]. Some right-wingers like [[Libertarianism|Libertarians]] and [[Neoliberalism|Neoliberals]] support unrestricted immigration, while others like [[Donald Trump]] reject open border policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Bowman|first= Sam|date= 13 April 2011|title= Immigration Restrictions Made us Poorer|url= https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/international/immigration-restrictions-make-us-poorer|work= Adam Smith Institute|location= |access-date= 27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some left-wingers like [[Democratic Socialism|Democratic Socialist]] [[Bernie Sanders]] reject open-border policies, while other left-wingers support open-borders, shown by the slogan "no human is illegal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Nagle|first1= Angela|last2= |first2= |date= |title= The Left Case Against Open Borders|url= https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2018/11/the-left-case-against-open-borders/#notes|journal= American Affairs|volume= 2|issue= 4|pages= 17-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments for open borders===
#Open borders advocates argue that free migration is the most effective way to reduce world poverty.

#From a human rights perspective, free migration may be seen to complement Article 13 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights: (1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state. (2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title.php?rowtag=PecoudMigration |title=Migration Without Borders : BERGHAHN BOOKS : Oxford, New York : Independent Publishing Since 1994 |publisher=Berghahn Books |date= |accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#American bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel]] has argued that "treating human beings differently, simply because they were born on the opposite side of a national boundary," is inherently unethical. According to Appel, such "birthrights" are only defensible if they serve "useful and meaningful social purposes" (such as inheritance rights, which encourage mothers and fathers to work and save for their children), but the "birthright of nationality" does not do so. Economist and writer [[Philippe Legrain]] argues that the countries of the world need migration to help global trade and reduce the occurrence of regional wars.
#Open borders cannot be dismissed as a utopian idea, argues [[Harald Bauder]], because they do not propose an alternative way to organize human society but rather are a critique of closed or controlled borders. This critique, however, invites the search for practical as well as radical solutions to the problematic consequences of contemporary migration practices, including the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, the US-Mexico border, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/Migration-Borders-Freedom/Bauder/p/book/9781138195608 |title=Migration Borders Freedom : Routledge : London |publisher=Routledge |date= |accessdate=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Restrictions on mobility can only be justified if it can be shown that those restrictions prevent significant harm. Since research indicates that open borders will be better for both the natives and the migrants, and at the very least have not been shown to cause major harm, those restrictions are unjustified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caplan|first=Bryan|date=2012-01-01|title=Why Should We Restrict Immigration?|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/ctojournl/v_3a32_3ay_3a2012_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a5-24.htm|journal=Cato Journal|volume=32|issue=1|pages=5–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that borders between the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) countries be opened. If goods and services and corporations can cross international boundaries without restraint, it is argued, then it does not make sense to restrain on the flow of people who work to make those goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Cavanaugh |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/117320.html |title=Open the Borders |website=Reason.com |date=2006-04-16 |accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimate that open borders where people are free to move and find work could result in 78 trillion dollars in economic gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/world-if/21724907-yes-it-would-be-disruptive-potential-gains-are-so-vast-objectors-could-be-bribed|title=A world of free movement would be $78 trillion richer|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those in favor of a global migration policy advocate the adoption of a migratory regulatory system and new criteria to better guaranteed all rights (civil, social and political) for all immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raffaele Marchetti|first=|date=Summer 2008|title=Toward a World Migratory Regime|url=|journal=Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies|volume= 15| issue =  2|pages=471–487|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary to expand migration policy to create better management of global migratory system. Some propose a new meaning and understanding of global citizenship to establish a border global migration system. Migration is under the control and management of local governments and officials, but it is both a domestic political issue, and a global issue which needs joint efforts from different countries.

===Arguments against open borders===
Controlled borders restrict migration by non-citizens. Several arguments for controlled borders and against open borders are as follows:

# That controlled borders encourage responsible policies in relation to population and birth rates for countries by preventing high population and high birth rate countries from disgorging their people onto other low population and low birth rate countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairus.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=16925&amp;security=1601&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1009  ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822200410/http://www.fairus.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=16925&amp;security=1601&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1009 |date=August 22, 2011 |title=Questions And Answers on Immigration and the Environment (Federation for American Immigration Reform)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/flashbks/immigr/populate.htm |title=Optimism and Overpopulation - 94.12 |publisher=Theatlantic.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturechange.org/issue10/overpopulation.html |title=The Road to Overpopulation is Roads |publisher=Culturechange.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Large-scale immigration from poorer countries into richer countries can create a "[[brain drain]]" in the source country, where educated professionals leave their home country to live elsewhere, depriving their home countries of an educated workforce. For example, in 2010 there were more Ethiopian doctors living in Chicago than there were in Ethiopia itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/06/11/countries-without-doctors/|title=Countries Without Doctors?|last=Tulenko|first=Kate|date=June 11, 2010|website=Foreign Policy|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of open borders==

===Nordic Passport Union===
One of the earliest open border agreements was the [[Nordic Passport Union]] of 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norden.org/en/om-samarbejdet-1/nordic-agreements/treaties-and-agreements/passport-issues-citizenship-and-national-registration/the-nordic-passport-convention|title=The Nordic Passport Convention — Nordic cooperation|website=www.norden.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire [[Nordic region]], apart from [[Svalbard]], the [[Faroe Islands]], and [[Greenland]] (see below), have subsequently become part of the [[Schengen Area]].

===Svalbard===
Uniquely, the Norwegian special territory of [[Svalbard]] is an [[Visa policy of Svalbard|entirely visa-free zone]]. No person requires a visa or residence permit and anyone may live and work in Svalbard indefinitely, regardless of citizenship. The [[Svalbard Treaty]] grants treaty nationals equal [[right of abode]] as Norwegian nationals. So far, non-treaty nationals have been admitted visa-free as well. 
"Regulations concerning rejection and expulsion from Svalbard" are in force on a non-discriminatory basis. Grounds for exclusion include lack of means of support, and violation of laws or regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry and residence|url=http://www.sysselmannen.no/en/Visitors/Entry-and-residence/|work=[[Governor of Svalbard]]|publisher=[[Governor of Svalbard]]|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sysselmannen.no/Documents/Sysselmannen_dok/English/Regulations/Regulations_relating_to_rejection_and_expulsion_of_persons_from_Svalbard_Me16t.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/07/200841012024779644.html|title=Immigrants warmly welcomed|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-day visa-free transit at [[Oslo Airport]] is possible when travelling on non-stop flights to Svalbard.

| [[File:Open Border - Schengen Zone.png|200px]]
| Most [[European Union]] (EU) and [[European Free Trade Area]] (EFTA) nations share open inter-state borders as part of the Schengen Agreement, allowing free flow of people between nations: controls on entry to the entire Schengen area are carried out at the first country of entry. However, some political scientists regard the EU as a ''de facto'' federation&lt;ref name="Built to Last"&gt;Kelemen, R. Daniel. (2007). {{cite web |url= http://www.princeton.edu/~smeunier/Kelemen%20Memo.pdf |title= Built to Last?

Border controls persist for travel between the Schengen area and the Anglo-Irish 'Common Travel Area' (see below), though these are relatively lightweight for EU/EFTA/Swiss citizens. In each case, there are more exacting entry restrictions on travellers who are not in these categories.

Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican City are ''de facto'' Schengen states (officially not members but have no border control on the border with their respective enclaving states). 

[[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] have shared open borders since the [[Nordic Passport Union]] arrangement in 1954.

== Discrimination ==
According to [[Daniel Wilsher]], detention has become a tool of power and political control. Immigrants became "[[Alien (law)|Alien]]s" when "the border began to emerge more clearly as a site of politics and regulation".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Immigration Detention: Law, History, Politics.|last=Wilsher|first=Daniel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn= 9781107417021 |location=Cambridge|pages=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economics and trade imbalances created wealth and power for countries, and immigrants challenge this. In the 19th century, immigrants were excluded based on race. “Such control initially took place at ports of entry in order to separate out aliens viewed as ‘undesirable’....this was mainly on economic and racial grounds.” Detention has increased and specific and different categories for immigration reasons are ignored in favour of the general category of “undocumented.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With no status, immigrants are subject to detention. Once labelled “illegal,” one's human rights diminish. “We can thus see that detention has now become a technique of control used in a great many different situations to a wide variety of different categories of foreigners.” Immigration is determined by the executive branch and courts have less of a role. Immigrants are not seen as part of the human community and thus have little legal status. “The doubtful status of aliens under domestic legal orders is mirrored in the absence of an international law framework regulating migration and migrants’ rights.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Immigrants are vulnerable because they lack national and international human rights. Immigrants are often detained because they are perceived as a threat to security. Many detention centres do not follow the normal rule of law. “[T]he exclusionary device of making people illegal is so complete that those so labelled scarcely even have human rights.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Opium Law''' (or ''Opiumwet'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) is the section of the [[Law of the Netherlands|Dutch law]] which covers nearly all [[psychotropic drug]]s. Most non-psychotropic, but prescription-only drugs are covered by the Medicine Act, the most well known exception being [[Ketamine]] which is covered by the Medicine Act.

== Origin and history ==
In 1912,&lt;ref&gt; http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index5174EN.html?pluginMethod=eldd.countryprofiles&amp;country=NL &lt;/ref&gt; the [[First International Opium Conference]] took place in [[The Hague]], where agreements were made about the trade in [[opium]]; this initiated the introduction of the Opium Law, which took place 7 years later. In 1919, the first Opium Law (later known as List I of the Opium Law) was introduced, and on 12 May 1928 the second Opium Law (later known as List II of the Opium Law) was introduced. The first Opium Law was created to regulate drugs with a high addiction or abuse factor, or that are physically harmful. As the name indicates the main reason for introduction was to regulate the Opium trade and later to control various other addictive drugs like [[morphine]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], [[barbiturates]], [[amphetamines]] and several decades later, [[benzodiazapines]], which were used both medically and recreationally.

Except for the addition of new drugs to List I and II of the Opium Law, the Opium Law remained unchanged until 1976. After the rise of a new youth culture which revolved much around the use of drugs like [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[LSD]], and with [[hashish]] being openly used, a change of law was needed by the government, to properly control all drugs, but with a clear definition between drugs with an unacceptable degree of addictiveness or physical harm (known as [[hard drugs]]), and drugs with an acceptable degree of addictiveness or physical harm (known as [[soft drugs]]).  In 1976 these changes officially took effect, and the Opium Law was edited to include the changes in the law. In the same year, a decision was made by the Dutch government discontinue prosecuting cannabis and hashish offenses, provided the person did not sell hard drugs, did not advertise and carried less than a specified maximum amount of cannabis or hashish.

In 1980, the decision to not prosecute cannabis and hashish dealers, under certain conditions, was publicly announced by the Dutch government.  Many people thereby concluded that this decision would also allow the sale in [[Cannabis coffee shop|coffee shop]]s, and coffee shops began selling cannabis and hashish. This led to an enormous rise in the number of coffee shops in the 80's and 90's, and because of this, new regulations were demanded by the government to regulate the sale of cannabis products by coffee shops. In 1996 the laws were changed again to include new regulations for coffee shops. The terms coffee shops had to follow were:
* No advertisement
* No hard drugs
* No entrance to coffee shops by persons under the age of 18
* No sale of more than 5&amp;nbsp;grams of cannabis products per person, per day
* Coffee shops are not allowed to have more than 500&amp;nbsp;grams of cannabis in stock at any time

Since 1996, no new changes have been made to the Opium Law. New guidelines for coffee shops have been made, but they are not covered by the Opium Law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-klinikka.fi/transdrug/resources/nl_policy_article.html#Top ''The elusive history of Dutch drug policy: Experiments with Delphi and scenario methods'', Transdrug website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/nieuws/2011/10/07/zware-cannabis-wordt-harddrug.html Zware cannabis wordt harddrug, de Nederlands Rijksoverheid, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical use ==
Even though List I substances are officially classified as hard drugs, several of them are often prescribed by licensed [[physician|doctors]]. For example, nearly all [[opioids]] are List I drugs, but they are commonly prescribed to cancer and HIV patients, as well as sufferers of chronic pain, although prescriptions for opioids are very scarce due to fear of misuse, and they are only prescribed in situations where they are certainly needed, like the terminally ill. Two [[stimulants]] which are both prescribed for [[Attention deficit disorder|ADD]]/[[ADHD]] and [[narcolepsy]]; dexamphetamine and methylphenidate, are also List I drugs of the Opium Law. On the other hand, all barbiturates except for secobarbital are List II drugs, while none of them, except for phenobarbital, are prescribed today. In theory, a licensed doctor could prescribe any substance they think is needed for the correct treatment of their [[patient]], both List I and List II substances of the Opium Law, though substances which aren't available as commercial [[pharmaceutical]] preparations have to be custom prepared by the designated [[pharmacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabis-med.org/dutch/Regulations/Opium_Act_Decree.pdf |accessdate=March 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024151904/http://www.cannabis-med.org/dutch/Regulations/Opium_Act_Decree.pdf |archivedate=October 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All prescriptions for List I and some List II substances ([[amobarbital]], [[buprenorphine]], [[butalbital]], [[cathine]], [[cyclobarbital]], [[flunitrazepam]], [[temazepam]], [[glutethimide]], hemp, [[pentazocine]] and [[pentobarbital]]) of the Opium Law have to be written in full in letters, and have to contain the name and initials, address, city and telephone number of the licensed prescriber issuing the prescriptions, as well as the name and initials, address and city of the person the prescription is issued to. If the prescription is issued for an animal, the data of the owner should be used instead, and a description of the animal has to be included on the prescription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cannabis-med.org/dutch/Regulations/Opium_Act_Decree.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Political Liberalism''''' is a 1993 book by [[John Rawls]],&lt;ref name="Rawls" &gt;John Rawls (1993 [2005]). ''Political Liberalism''. [http://cup.columbia.edu/book/political-liberalism/9780231130882 Description], table of contents as linked at [http://cup.columbia.edu/sampler/9780231130882/google-preview Contents], and selected pages from the [https://books.google.com/books?id=roHeAMi8W14C&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PR23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false introductions] and after. New York：[[Columbia University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; an update to his earlier ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971).  In it, he attempts to show that his theory of [[justice]] is not a "comprehensive conception of [[Good and evil|the good]]" but is instead compatible with a [[liberalism|liberal]] conception of the role of justice, namely, that government should be neutral between competing conceptions of the good. Rawls tries to show that his two principles of justice, properly understood, form a "theory of the right" (as opposed to a theory of the good) which would be supported by all reasonable individuals, even under conditions of reasonable [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]]. The mechanism by which he demonstrates this is called "[[overlapping consensus]]". Here he also develops his idea of [[public reason]].

An expanded edition of the book was published in 2005.  It includes an added introduction, the essay "The Idea of Public Reason Revisited" (1997) — some 60 pp. — and an index to the new material.&lt;ref name="Rawls" /&gt; 

==Reception==
A 1993 review  by [[Stuart Hampshire]] writes that:
:Rawls’s great achievement in international thought was to restore the notion of justice to its proper place at the center of arguments about politics, the place that it had occupied at the very beginning of theorizing in Plato’s Republic. Justice is a necessary virtue of individuals both in their day-to-day conduct and in their personal relations, and it is the principal virtue of institutions and the social order.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Hampshire (1993). [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1993/08/12/liberalism-the-new-twist/ "Liberalism: The New Twist,"] [[New York Review of Books]], August 12.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Samuel Freeman (1994) concludes that:  
:The political conception provides a public justification of liberal institutions that is "freestanding," hence based in fundamental ideals democratic citizens share in common, and independent of the comprehensive views that form an overlapping consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Freeman (1994). [http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2933&amp;context=cklawreview "Political Liberalism and the Possibility of a Just Democratic Constitution,"] ''Chicago-Kent Law Review'',  69(3), Symposium on John Rawl's Political Liberalism, p. 668.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuat  Gursozlu  (2014) notes a condition for sustainable liberalism identified in the volume: 
:Rawls is aware that when unreasonable doctrines grow so strong, it may be too late for the liberal democratic regime. The argument for the normative stability of the regime and the account of containment as transformation points out the need to prevent the unreasonable from becoming strong enough to overwhelm the liberal political regime.&lt;ref&gt;Fuat  Gursozlu  (2014). [http://digitalcommons.tourolaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2356&amp;context=lawreview "Political Liberalism and the Fate of Unreasonable People,"] ''Touro Law Review'', 30(1), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proto-fascism''' refers to the direct predecessor ideologies and cultural movements that influenced and formed the basis of [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Spackman. Fascist virilities: rhetoric, ideology, and social fantasy in Italy. Pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davies, Derek Lynch. ''The Routledge companion to fascism and the far right''.

Fascist virilities: rhetoric, ideology, and social fantasy in Italy. Pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Proto-fascist political movements include the [[Italian Nationalist Association]] (ANI), the [[German National Association of Commercial Employees]] (DHV) and the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davies, Derek Lynch. ''The Routledge companion to fascism and the far right''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge. Pp. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Precedence to modern fascism can be seen in the culture and government of older nations based heavily on law and order, such as the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[ancien régime|anciens régimes]] of Europe.

Other people that have been labeled proto-fascist are [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Charles Maurras]] and [[Ion Dragoumis]] (by John Mazis in his book "A Man For All Seasons"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ethnikonkratos.gr/2017/06/05/%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%BC%CE%AC%CE%B6%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%BF-%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%BC%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%BD-%CE%AD%CF%87%CF%89-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%BC/|title=Γιάννης Μάζης: «Ο Δραγούμης δεν έχω καμία αμφιβολία ότι ήταν ένας πρωτοφασίστας»|date=2017-06-04|work=Εθνικόν Κράτος|access-date=2018-10-23|language=el-GR}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

A '''referendum''' (plural: '''referendums''' or less commonly '''referenda''') is a direct [[vote]] in which an entire [[Constituency|electorate]] is invited to vote on a particular proposal. This may result in the adoption of a new law. In some countries, it is synonymous with a '''plebiscite''' or a vote on a '''ballot question'''.

Some definitions of 'plebiscite' suggest that it is a type of vote to change the constitution or government of a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/plebiscite |title=Definition of Plebiscite |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some other countries define it differently. For example,  Australia defines 'referendum' as a vote to change the constitution, and 'plebiscite' as a vote that does not affect the constitution.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2015/08/plebiscite-or-referendum-whats-the-difference.html | title=Plebiscite or Referendum - What's the Difference | publisher=ABC | date=12 August 2015 | accessdate=23 August 2015 | author=Green, Antony}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, the vote to adopt its constitution was called a "plebiscite", but a subsequent vote to amend the constitution is called a 'referendum', and so is a poll of the electorate on a non-constitutional bill.

==Etymology and plural form==
'Referendum' is the [[gerundive]] form of the [[Latin language|Latin]] verb ''refero'', literally "to carry back" (from the verb ''fero'', "to bear, bring, carry"&lt;ref&gt;Marchant &amp; Charles, Cassell's Latin Dictionary, 1928, p.221&lt;/ref&gt; plus the inseparable [[preposition]] ''re-'', here meaning "back".&lt;ref&gt;Marchant &amp; Charles, Cassell's Latin Dictionary, 1928, p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt;) As a gerundive is an [[adjective]],&lt;ref&gt;A gerundive is a verbal adjective (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.)&lt;/ref&gt; not a [[noun]],&lt;ref&gt;A [[gerund]] however is a verbal noun (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.) but has no nominative case, for which an infinitive (''referre'') serves the purpose&lt;/ref&gt; it cannot be used alone in Latin and must be contained within a  context attached to a noun such as ''Propositum qui referendum est populo'', "A proposal which must be carried back to the people". The addition of the verb ''sum'' (3rd person singular, ''est'') to a gerundive, denotes the idea of necessity or compulsion, that which "must" be done, rather than that which is "fit for" doing. Its use as a noun in English is thus not a strictly grammatical usage of a foreign word, but is rather a freshly coined English noun, which therefore follows English grammatical usage, not Latin grammatical usage. This determines the form of the plural in English, which according to English grammar should be "referendums". The use of "referenda" as a plural form in English (treating it as a Latin word and attempting to apply to it the rules of Latin grammar) is thus insupportable according to the rules of both Latin and English grammar alike. The use of "referenda" as a plural form is  posited hypothetically as either a gerund or a gerundive by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which rules out such usage in both cases as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Referendum&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Referendums'' is logically preferable as a plural form meaning 'ballots on one issue' (as a Latin gerund,&lt;ref&gt;a [[gerund]] is a verbal noun (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.) but has no nominative case, for which an infinitive (''referre'') serves the purpose. It has only accusative, genitive, dative and ablative cases (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, pp. 91-2.)&lt;/ref&gt; referendum has no plural). The Latin plural gerundive 'referenda', meaning 'things to be referred', necessarily connotes a plurality of issues".&lt;ref&gt;i.e. ''Proposita quae referenda sunt popolo'', "Proposals which must be carried back to the people"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is closely related to the [[political agenda]], "those matters which must be driven forward", from ''ago'', to drive (cattle); and the [[memorandum]], "that matter which must be remembered", from ''memoro'', to call to mind.

==Earliest use ==
The name and use of the 'referendum' is thought to have originated in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] canton of [[Graubünden]] as early as the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Benjamin R.. ''The Death of Communal Liberty: A History of Freedom in a Swiss Mountain Canton''. Princeton University Press, 1974, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, J.M.. ''State and Federal Government in Switzerland'', Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;122&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'plebiscite' has a generally similar meaning in modern usage, and comes from the Latin ''plebiscita'', which originally meant a decree of the ''[[Plebeian Council|Concilium Plebis]]'' (Plebeian Council), the popular assembly of the [[Roman Republic]]. Today, a referendum can also often be referred to as a plebiscite, but in some countries the two terms are used differently to refer to votes with differing types of legal consequences. For example,  Australia defines 'referendum' as a vote to change the constitution, and 'plebiscite' as a vote that does not affect the constitution.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; In contrast, Ireland has only ever held one plebiscite, which was the vote to adopt its constitution, and every other vote has been called a referendum. Plebiscite has also been used to denote a non-binding vote count such as the one held by Nazi Germany to 'approve' in retrospect the so-called Anschluss with Austria, the question being not 'Do you permit?' but rather 'Do you approve?' of that which has most definitely already occurred.

==Typology==
The term referendum covers a variety of different meanings. A referendum can be binding or advisory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=2–3 |title=The Dynamics of Referendum Campaigns: An International Perspective|chapter=Context, Elites, Media and Public Opinion in Reerendums: When Campaigns Really Matter|last= de Vreese |first=Claes H. |isbn=9780230591189 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=wHuGDAAAQBAJ |date= 2007 |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, different names are used for these two types of referendum.

Referendums can be further classified by who initiates them: mandatory referendums prescribed by law, voluntary referendums initiated by the legislature or government, and referendums initiated by citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Serdült|first1=Uwe|last2=Welp|first2=Yanina|title=Direct Democracy Upside Down|journal=Taiwan Journal of Democracy| date=2012 |volume=8 |issue=1 |url=http://www.tfd.org.tw/export/sites/tfd/files/publication/journal/dj0801/004.pdf|doi=10.5167/uzh-98412|pages=69–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[deliberative referendum]] is a referendum specifically designed to improve the deliberative qualities of the campaign preceding the referendum vote, and/or of the act of voting itself.

==Rationale==
From a political-philosophical perspective, referendums are an expression of [[direct democracy]]. However, in the modern world, most referendums need to be understood within the context of representative democracy. Therefore, they tend to be used quite selectively, covering issues such as changes in voting systems, where currently elected officials may not have the legitimacy or inclination to implement such changes.

==Referendums by country==
{{Further|Referendums by country}}
Since the end of the 18th century, hundreds of national referendums have been organised in the world;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Bruno S. Frey et Claudia Frey Marti, ''Le bonheur. L'approche économique'', [[Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes]], 2013 ({{ISBN|978-2-88915-010-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; almost 600 national votes were held in [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]] since its inauguration as a [[Modern history of Switzerland|modern state in 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/explore-600-national-votes_how-direct-democracy-has-grown-over-the-decades/41481992 |title=How direct democracy has grown over the decades |author=Duc-Quang Nguyen |publisher=swissinfo.ch - a branch of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG SSR |date=17 June 2015  |location=Berne, Switzerland |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italy]] ranked second with 72 [[Referendums in Italy|national referendums]]: 67 popular referendums, 3 constitutional referendums, [[Italian institutional referendum, 1946|one institutional referendum]] and [[Italian advisory referendum, 1989|one advisory referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://elezionistorico.interno.it/index.php?tpel=F&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiple-choice referendums==
A referendum usually offers the electorate a choice of accepting or rejecting a proposal, but this is not necessarily the case. In [[Switzerland]], for example, multiple choice referendums are common. Among several other instances, two multiple choice referendums held in [[Sweden]], in 1957 and in 1980, offered voters three options; in 1977, a referendum held in [[Australia]] to determine a new [[Advance Australia Fair|national anthem]] was held in which voters had four choices; in 1992, New Zealand held a five-option referendum on their electoral system; and in 1982, Guam had one on six options, with an additional blank option for anyone(s) wishing to (campaign and) vote for their own seventh option.

A multiple choice referendum poses the question of how the result is to be determined. If no single option receives the support of an absolute [[majority]] (more than half) of voters resort can be made to the two-round system or the alternative vote (AV, which is also called IRV, PV, or STV). In 2018 the [[Citizens' Assembly (Ireland)|Citizens' Assembly]] considered [[referendums in Ireland]], with 76% supporting allowing more than two options, and 52% favouring STV in such cases.&lt;ref name="citizensassembly_referenda"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citizensassembly.ie/en/Manner-in-which-referenda-are-held/Manner-in-which-referenda-are-held.html|title=Manner in which referenda are held|publisher=Citizens' Assembly|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people regard a non-majoritarian methodology like the [[Modified Borda count, MBC]] as more inclusive and more accurate.

Swiss referendums offer a separate vote on each of the multiple options as well as an additional decision about which of the multiple options should be preferred. In the Swedish case, in both referendums the 'winning' option was chosen by the [[First Past the Post electoral system|Single Member Plurality]] ("first past the post") system. In other words, the winning option was deemed to be that supported by a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]], rather than an absolute majority, of voters. In the 1977, Australian referendum, the winner was chosen by the system of preferential [[instant-runoff voting, IRV or PV]]. Polls in Newfoundland (1949) and Guam (1982), for example, were counted under a form of the [[two-round system]], and an unusual form of TRS was used in the 1992 New Zealand poll.

Although [[California]] does not have deliberate multiple-choice referendums in the Swiss or Swedish sense (in which only one of several counter-propositions can be victorious, and the losing proposals are wholly null and void), it does have so many yes-or-no referendums at each Election Day that the State's Constitution provides a method for resolving conflicts when two or more inconsistent propositions are passed on the same day. This is a de facto form of [[approval voting]]—i.e. the proposition with the most "yes" votes prevails over the others to the extent of any conflict.

Another voting system that could be used in multiple-choice referendum is the [[Condorcet method|Condorcet rule]].

==Criticisms==

===Criticism of populist aspect===
[[File:Odessa Russian Sring 20140330 07.JPG|thumb|Pro-Russian protesters in [[Odessa]], [[Ukraine]], demanding a referendum, March 30, 2014]]
[[File:20150703 Greek Referendum Demonstration for NO syntagma square Athens Greece.jpg|thumb| [[Greek bailout referendum, 2015]] Demonstration for "NO" vote [[Syntagma square]] [[Athens]], [[Greece]] ]]

Critics{{who|date=February 2016}} of the referendum argue that voters in a referendum are more likely to be driven by transient whims than by careful deliberation, or that they are not sufficiently informed to make decisions on complicated or technical issues. Also, voters might be swayed by [[propaganda]], strong personalities, intimidation, and expensive advertising campaigns. [[James Madison]] argued that direct democracy is the "[[tyranny of the majority]]".

Some opposition to the referendum has arisen from its use by dictators such as [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] who, it is argued,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Qvortrup|first1=Matt |title=Direct Democracy: A Comparative Study of the Theory and Practice of Government by the People|isbn=978-0-7190-8206-1|date=2013|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the plebiscite to disguise oppressive policies as [[populism]]. Dictators may also make use of referendums as well as [[show elections]] to further legitimize their authority such as Benito Mussolini in [[Italian general election, 1934|1934]], Adolf Hitler in [[German election and referendum, 1936|1936]], [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in [[Philippine constitutional plebiscite, 1973|1973]], [[Park Chung-hee]] in [[South Korean constitutional referendum, 1972|1972]], and [[Francisco Franco]] in [[Spanish law of succession referendum, 1947|1947]]. Hitler's use of plebiscites is argued{{by whom|date=March 2016}} as the reason why, since [[World War II]], there has been no provision in [[Germany]] for the holding of referendums at the federal level.

In recent years, referendums have been used strategically by several European governments trying to pursue political and electoral goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jcer.net/index.php/jcer/article/view/836/781|first1= Cecilia Emma |last1=Sottilotta|date= 2017|title=The Strategic Use of Government-Sponsored Referendums in Contemporary Europe: Issues and Implications|journal= Journal of Contemporary European Research|volume=13|issue=4|pages=1361–1376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patten's criticism===
British politician [[Chris Patten]] summarized many of the arguments used by those who oppose the referendum in an interview in 2003, when discussing the possibility of a referendum in the [[United Kingdom]] on the [[Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe|European Union Constitution]]:

{{quote|I think referendums are awful. The late and great [[Julian Critchley]] used to say that, not very surprisingly, they were the favourite form of plebiscitary democracy of Mussolini and Hitler. They undermine Westminster. What they ensure, as we saw in the last election, is that if you have a referendum on an issue, politicians during an election campaign say: "Oh, we're not going to talk about that, we don't need to talk about that, that's all for the referendum." So during the last election campaign, the euro was hardly debated. I think referendums are fundamentally anti-democratic in our system, and I wouldn't have anything to do with them. On the whole, governments only concede them when governments are weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast_with_frost/2954232.stm |title=Breakfast with Frost &amp;#124; Interview with Chris Patten, EU Commissioner for External Affairs on Sunday 01 June 2003 |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-06-01 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Closed questions and the separability problem===
Some critics of the referendum attack the use of closed questions. A difficulty which can plague a referendum of two issues or more is called the [[separability problem]]. If one issue is in fact, or in perception, related to another on the ballot, the imposed simultaneous voting of first preference on each issue can result in an outcome that is displeasing to most.

===Undue limitations on regular government power===
Several commentators have noted that the use of [[initiative|citizens' initiatives]] to amend constitutions has so tied the government to a mishmash of popular demands as to render the government unworkable. ''[[The Economist]]'' has made this point about the US State of [[California]], which has passed so many referendums restricting the ability of the state government to tax the people and pass the budget that the state has become effectively ungovernable. Calls for an entirely new Californian constitution have been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

A similar problem however arises when elected governments accumulate excessive debts. That can severely reduce the effective margin for later governments.

Both these problems can be moderated by a combination of other measures as 
* strict rules for correct accounting on budget plans and effective public expenditure;
* mandatory assessment by an independent public institution of all budgetary implications of all legislative proposals, before they can be approved;
* mandatory prior assessment of the constitutional coherence of any proposal;
* interdiction of extra-budget expenditure (tax payers anyway have to fund them, sooner or later).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10546">In the [[regulation]] of [[algorithm]]s, particularly [[artificial intelligence]] and its subfield of [[machine learning]], a '''right to explanation''' (or '''right to ''an'' explanation''') is a [[right]] to be given an [[explanation]] for an output of the algorithm. Such rights primarily refer to [[individual right]]s to be given an explanation for decisions that significantly affect an individual, particularly legally or financially. For example, a person who applies for a loan and is denied may ask for an explanation, which could be "[[Credit bureau]] X reports that you declared bankruptcy last year; this is the main factor in considering you too likely to default, and thus we will not give you the loan you applied for."

Some such [[legal right]]s already exist, while the scope of a general "right to explanation" is a matter of ongoing debate.

== Examples ==
=== Credit score in the United States ===
{{details|Credit score in the United States}}

[[Credit score in the United States]] – more generally, credit actions – have a well-established right to explanation. Under the [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act]] (Regulation B of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]]),
Title 12, Chapter X, Part 1002, [https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=1bb14fdfd1afc7d3f2d4756d223aeadb&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.8.1002_19 §1002.9], creditors are required to notify applicants of action taken in certain circumstances, and such notifications must provide specific reasons, as detailed in §1002.9(b)(2):&lt;ref&gt;[[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]], [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/eregulations/1002-9/2011-31714#1002-9-b-2 §1002.9(b)(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|(2) Statement of specific reasons. The statement of reasons for adverse action required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section must be specific and indicate the principal reason(s) for the adverse action. Statements that the adverse action was based on the creditor's internal standards or policies or that the applicant, joint applicant, or similar party failed to achieve a qualifying score on the creditor's credit scoring system are insufficient.}}

The [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/eregulations/1002-Subpart-Interp/2011-31714#1002-9-b-2-Interp-1 official interpretation] of this section details what types of statements are acceptable.

Credit agencies and data analysis firms such as [[FICO]] comply with this regulation by providing a list of reasons (generally at most 4, per interpretation of regulations), consisting of a numeric '''{{visible anchor|reason code}}''' (as identifier) and an associated explanation, identifying the main factors affecting a credit score.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creditscoring.com/creditscore/fico/factors/reason-codes.html US FICO credit risk score reason codes: Fundamental document from FICO listing all of the FICO credit score reasons that a score is not higher], March 31, 2010, by Greg Fisher&lt;/ref&gt; An example might be:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reasoncode.org/reasoncode101 Reason Codes 101]&lt;/ref&gt;

:32: Balances on bankcard or revolving accounts too high compared to credit limits

=== European Union ===

The European Union [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (enacted 2016, taking effect 2018), extends the automated decision-making rights in the 1995 [[Data Protection Directive]] to provide a legally disputed form of a right to an explanation, stated as such in [https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/r71.htm Recital 71]: "[the data subject should have] the right ... to obtain an explanation of the decision reached". In full:

{{quote|
The data subject should have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure, evaluating personal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on automated processing and which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her, such as automatic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention.

...

In any case, such processing should be subject to suitable safeguards, which should include specific information to the data subject and the right to obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view, to obtain an explanation of the decision reached after such assessment and to challenge the decision.}}

However, the extent to which the regulations themselves provide a "right to explanation" is heavily debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodman |first1=Bryce |title=European Union Regulations on Algorithmic Decision-Making and a 'Right to Explanation' |last2=Flaxman |first2=Seth |url=https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2741 |journal=AI Magazine |year=2017 |doi=10.1609/aimag.v38i3.2741}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://iapp.org/news/a/is-there-a-right-to-explanation-for-machine-learning-in-the-gdpr/ Is there a 'right to explanation' for machine learning in the GDPR?], Jun 1, 2017, Andrew Burt&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main strands of criticism. There are significant legal issues with the right as found in Article 22 — as recitals are not binding, and the right to an explanation is not mentioned in the binding articles of the text, having been removed during the legislative process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=2903469 |last1=Wachter |first1=Sandra |last2=Mittelstadt |first2=Brent |last3=Floridi |first3=Luciano |title=Why a Right to Explanation of Automated Decision-Making Does Not Exist in the General Data Protection Regulation |date=December 28, 2016 |journal=International Data Privacy Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are significant restrictions on the types of automated decisions that are covered — which must be both "solely" based on automated processing, and have legal or similarly significant effect — which limits their applicability in many of the cases of algorithmic controversy that have been picked up in the media.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Lilian|last2=Veale|first2=Michael|date=2017|title=Slave to the algorithm? Why a "right to an explanation" is probably not the remedy you are looking for|url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=2972855|journal=Duke Law and Technology Review|volume=|pages=|ssrn=2972855|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second source of such a right has been pointed to in Article 15, the "right of access by the data subject". This restates a similar provision from the 1995 Data Protection Directive, allowing the data subject access to "meaningful information about the logic involved" in the same significant, solely automated decision-making, found in Article 22. Yet this too suffers from alleged challenges that relate to the timing of when this right can be drawn upon, as well as practical challenges that mean it may not be binding in many cases of public concern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== France ===
In [[France]] the 2016 ''Loi pour une République numérique'' (Digital Republic Act or ''loi numérique'') amends the country's administrative code to introduce a new provision for the explanation of decisions made by public sector bodies about individuals.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Lilian|last2=Veale|first2=Michael|date=2018|title=Enslaving the Algorithm: From a ‘Right to an Explanation’ to a ‘Right to Better Decisions’?|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3052831|journal=IEEE Security &amp; Privacy|volume=|pages=|ssrn=3052831|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It notes that where there is "a decision taken on the basis of an algorithmic treatment", the rules that define that treatment and its “principal characteristics” must be communicated to the citizen upon request, where there is not an exclusion (e.g. for national security or defence). These should include the following:
# the degree and the mode of contribution of the algorithmic processing to the decision- making;
# the data processed and its source;
# the treatment parameters, and where appropriate, their weighting, applied to the situation of the person concerned;
# the operations carried out by the treatment. 
Scholars have noted that this right, while limited to administrative decisions, goes beyond the GDPR right to explicitly apply to decision support rather than decisions "solely" based on automated processing, as well as provides a framework for explaining specific decisions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Indeed, the GDPR automated decision-making rights in the European Union, one of the places a "right to an explanation" has been sought within, find their origins in French law in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bygrave|first=L A|date=2001|title=Minding the Machine: Article 15 of the EC Data Protection Directive and Automated Profiling|url=http://folk.uio.no/lee/oldpage/articles/Minding_machine.pdf|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|volume=17|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1016/S0267-3649(01)00104-2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Some argue that a "right to explanation" is at best unnecessary, at worst harmful, and threatens to stifle innovation. Specific criticisms include: favoring human decisions over machine decisions; being redundant with existing laws; and focusing on process over outcome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techzone360.com/topics/techzone/articles/2017/01/25/429101-eus-right-explanation-harmful-restriction-artificial-intelligence.htm EU's Right to Explanation: A Harmful Restriction on Artificial Intelligence], Nick Wallace, Center for Data Innovation, January 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

More fundamentally, many algorithms used in machine learning are not easily explainable. For example, the output of a [[deep neural network]] depends on many layers of computations, connected in a complex way, and no one input or computation may be a dominant factor. The field of [[Explainable AI]] seeks to provide better explanations from existing algorithms, and algorithms that are more easily explainable, but it is a young and active field.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Similarly, human decisions often cannot be easily explained: they may be based on intuition or a "[[gut feeling]]" that is hard to put into words. Requiring machines to meet a higher standard than humans is thus arguably unreasonable.

'''''Roe v. Wade''''', 410 U.S. 113 (1973),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Roe v. Wade|410|113|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark decision]] issued in 1973 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] on the issue of the constitutionality of laws that [[abortion law|criminalized or restricted]] access to [[abortion]]s.  The Court ruled 7–2 that a right to [[Privacy#Privacy law|privacy]] under the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] extended to a woman's decision to have an abortion, but that this right must be balanced against the state's interests in regulating abortions: protecting women's health and protecting the potentiality of human life.&lt;ref&gt;''See Roe'', 410 U.S. at 162 ("We repeat, however, that the State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman, whether she be a resident of the State or a non-resident who seeks medical consultation and treatment there, and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.").&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that these state interests became stronger over the course of a pregnancy, the Court resolved this [[balancing test]] by tying state regulation of abortion to the third [[Trimester (pregnancy)#Physiology|trimester of pregnancy]].

Later, in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992),&lt;ref name="Casey"&gt;{{ussc|name=Planned Parenthood v.

==Background==

===History of abortion laws in the United States===
According to the Court, "the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage." Providing a historical analysis on abortion, Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] noted that abortion was "resorted to without scruple" in Greek and Roman times.&lt;ref&gt;''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackmun also addressed the permissive and restrictive abortion attitudes and laws throughout history, noting the disagreements among leaders (of all different professions) in those eras and the formative laws and cases.&lt;ref&gt;''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 131–136, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, in 1821, Connecticut passed the first state statute criminalizing abortion.

=== History of the case ===
In June 1969, 21-year-old [[Norma McCorvey]] discovered she was pregnant with her third child. She returned to [[Dallas]], Texas, where friends advised her to assert falsely that she had been raped in order to obtain a legal abortion (with the understanding that Texas law allowed abortion in cases of rape and incest). However, this scheme failed because there was no police report documenting the alleged rape. In any case, the Texas statute allowed abortion only ”for the purpose of saving the life of the mother”. She attempted to obtain an [[Illegal abortion]], but found that the unauthorized facility had been closed down by the police. Eventually, she was referred to attorneys [[Linda Coffee]] and [[Sarah Weddington]].&lt;ref&gt;McCorvey, Norma and Meisler, Andy. ''I Am Roe: My Life, Roe V.

== Before the Supreme Court ==
''Roe v. Wade'' reached the Supreme Court on appeal in 1970. The justices delayed taking action on ''Roe'' and a closely related case, ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', until they had decided ''[[Younger v. Harris]]'' (because they felt the appeals raised difficult questions on judicial jurisdiction) and ''[[United States v. Vuitch]]'' (in which they considered the constitutionality of a [[Washington D.C.|District of Columbia]] statute that criminalized abortion except where the mother's life or health was endangered). In ''Vuitch'', the Court narrowly upheld the statute, though in doing so, it treated abortion as a medical procedure and stated that physicians must be given room to determine what constitutes a danger to (physical or mental) health. The day after they announced their decision in ''Vuitch'', they voted to hear both ''Roe'' and ''Doe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=77–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments were scheduled by the full Court for December 13, 1971. Before the Court could hear the oral arguments, Justices [[Hugo Black]] and [[John Marshall Harlan II]] retired. [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren Burger]] asked Justice [[Potter Stewart]] and Justice Blackmun to determine whether ''Roe'' and ''Doe'', among others, should be heard as scheduled. According to Blackmun, Stewart felt that the cases were a straightforward application of ''Younger v. Harris'', and they recommended that the Court move forward as scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his opening argument in defense of the abortion restrictions, attorney Jay Floyd made what was later described as the "worst joke in legal history."&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;Sant, Geoffrey. "[http://www.salon.com/2013/07/26/8_horrible_courtroom_jokes_and_their_ensuing_legal_calamity 8 horrible courtroom jokes and their ensuing legal calamities]", ''Salon.com'' (July 27, 2013): "The title of Worst Joke in Legal History belongs to one of history's highest-profile cases.

It's an old joke, but when a man argues against two beautiful ladies like this, they are going to have the last word." His remark was met with cold silence; one observer thought that Chief Justice Burger "was going to come right off the bench at him. He glared him down."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Malphurs|2010|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garrow|1994|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a first round of arguments, all seven justices tentatively agreed that the Texas law should be struck down, but on varying grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burger assigned the role of writing the Court's opinion in ''Roe'' (as well as ''Doe'') to Blackmun, who began drafting a preliminary opinion that emphasized what he saw as the Texas law's vagueness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1988|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; (At this point, Black and Harlan had been replaced by Justices [[William Rehnquist]] and [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.]], but they arrived too late to hear the first round of arguments.) But Blackmun felt that his opinion did not adequately reflect his liberal colleagues' views.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=81–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1972, he proposed that the case be reargued. Justice [[William O. Douglas]] threatened to write a dissent from the reargument order (he and the other liberal justices were suspicious that Rehnquist and Powell would vote to uphold the statute), but was coaxed out of the action by his colleagues, and his dissent was merely mentioned in the reargument order without further statement or opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garrow|1994|p=556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was reargued on October 11, 1972. Weddington continued to represent ''Roe'', and Texas Assistant Attorney General Robert C. Flowers replaced Jay Floyd for Texas.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;!--Probably in {{harvnb|Garrow|1994|pp=569–570}} but if not why not say "...Texas Assistant Attorney General [[Robert C. Flowers]] represented Wade."--&gt;

Blackmun continued to work on his opinions in both cases over the summer recess, even though there was no guarantee that he would be assigned to write them again. Over the recess, he spent a week researching the history of abortion at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Minnesota, where he had worked in the 1950s. After the Court heard the second round of arguments, Powell said he would agree with Blackmun's conclusion but pushed for ''Roe'' to be the lead of the two abortion cases being considered. Powell also suggested that the Court strike down the Texas law on privacy grounds. Justice [[Byron White]] was unwilling to sign on to Blackmun's opinion, and Rehnquist had already decided to dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=93–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supreme Court decision ==
[[File:US Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, detail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harry Blackmun]] wrote the Court's opinion.]]
The Court issued its decision on January 22, 1973, with a 7-to-2 majority vote in favor of Roe. Justices Burger, Douglas, and Stewart filed concurring opinions, and Justice White filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Rehnquist joined. Burger's, Douglas's, and White's opinions were issued along with the Court's opinion in ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' (announced on the same day as ''Roe v. Wade''). The Court deemed abortion a [[fundamental right]] under the [[United States Constitution]], thereby subjecting all laws attempting to restrict it to the standard of [[strict scrutiny]].&lt;ref&gt;Although abortion is still considered a fundamental right under current jurisprudence, [[#Role in subsequent decisions and politics|subsequent cases]], notably ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', and ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' have affected the legal standard.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to privacy ===
The Court declined to adopt the district court's [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] rationale, and instead asserted that the "right of privacy, whether it be founded in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the district court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."&lt;ref&gt;Chase, H. et al. (1975). ''Supplement to Edward S. Corwin's The constitution and what it means today: Supreme Court decisions of 1973, 1974, and 1975'', p. 36. Princeton University Press: "The abortion cases afforded the Supreme Court another opportunity to caress the Ninth Amendment without embracing it."&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas, in his concurring opinion in the companion case, Doe, stated more emphatically, "The Ninth Amendment obviously does not create federally enforceable rights."&lt;ref&gt;Devins, Neal and Watson, Wendy (1995). ''Judicial Nominations'', p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Blackmun's majority opinion explicitly rejected a fetal "right to life" argument.&lt;ref&gt;''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 156–159.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court instead recognized the right to an abortion as a fundamental right included within the guarantee of personal privacy.&lt;ref&gt;''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 153 ("This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.").&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, regulations limiting abortion had to be justified by a "compelling state interest," and legislative enactments regulating abortion had to be narrowly tailored to meet the compelling interests; in other words, Justice Blackmun applied a strict scrutiny analysis to abortion regulations.&lt;ref&gt;''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

While acknowledging that the right to abortion was not unlimited, Justice Blackmun, speaking for the Court, created a trimester framework to balance the fundamental right to abortion with the government's two legitimate interests: protecting the mother's health and protecting the "potentiality of human life." The trimester framework addressed when a woman's fundamental right to abortion would be absolute, and when the state's interests would become compelling. In the first trimester, when it was believed that the procedure was [[Abortion#Safety|safer than childbirth]], the Court left the decision to abort completely to the woman and her physician.&lt;ref&gt;''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 163.&lt;/ref&gt; From approximately the end of the first trimester until [[fetal viability]], the state's interest in protecting the health of the mother would become "compelling."&lt;ref name="Id. at 163"&gt;''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 163.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the state could regulate the abortion procedure if the regulation "reasonably relate[d] to the "preservation and protection of maternal health."&lt;ref name="Id. at 163"/&gt; At the point of viability, which the Court believed to be in the third trimester, the state's interest in "potential life" would become compelling, and the state could regulate abortion to protect "potential life."&lt;ref name="Id. at 163"/&gt; At that point, the state could even forbid abortion so long as it made an exception to preserve the life or health of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 163–164 ("If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.").&lt;/ref&gt; The Court added that the primary right being preserved in the ''Roe'' decision was that of the physician to practice medicine freely absent a compelling state interest – not women's rights in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, however, the plurality of Justices [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[David Souter]], and [[Anthony Kennedy]] made a subtle move away from the physician's-rights approach of ''Roe'' and toward a patient's-rights approach in ''Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey''. The plurality in ''Casey'', explicitly confirming that women had a constitutional right to abortion and further upholding the "essential holding" of ''Roe'', stated that women had a right to choose abortion before viability and that this right could not be unduly interfered with by the state.&lt;ref name=Casey846&gt;''Casey'', 505 U.S. at 846.&lt;/ref&gt; They asserted that this right was rooted in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref name=Casey846/&gt;

Prior to the decision, the justices discussed the trimester framework at great length. Justice Powell had suggested that the point where the state could intervene be placed at viability, which Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] supported as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an internal memo to the other justices before the majority decision was published, Justice Blackmun wrote: "You will observe that I have concluded that the end of the first trimester is critical. This is arbitrary, but perhaps any other selected point, such as [[quickening]] or viability, is equally arbitrary."&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Bob.

=== Justiciability ===
An aspect of the decision that attracted comparatively little attention was the Court's disposition of the issues of [[Standing (law)|standing]] and [[mootness]]. Under the traditional interpretation of these rules, Jane Roe's appeal was "moot" because she had already given birth to her child and thus would not be affected by the ruling; she also lacked "standing" to assert the rights of other pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;Abernathy, M. et al. (1993), ''[https://books.google.com/?id=tHhlYpWokFIC Civil Liberties Under the Constitution]''. U. South Carolina, p. 4. Retrieved February 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As she did not present an "actual [[case or controversy]]" (a grievance and a demand for relief), any opinion issued by the Supreme Court would constitute an [[advisory opinion]].

The Court concluded that the case came within an established exception to the rule: one that allowed consideration of an issue that was "capable of repetition, yet evading review."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Federal Jurisdiction |series=Introduction to Law |first=Erwin |last=Chemerinsky |authorlink=Erwin Chemerinsky |edition=4th |publisher=Aspen Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7355-2718-8 |page=132 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wgpGAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase had been coined in 1911 by Justice [[Joseph McKenna]] in ''[[Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Southern Pacific v. Interstate Commerce Commission|volume=219|page=498|pin=|year=1911}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackmun's opinion quoted McKenna and noted that pregnancy would normally conclude more quickly than an appellate process: "If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied."&lt;ref&gt;''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 125; see also {{harvnb|Schwartz|1988|pp=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dissents ==
[[File:Justice White Official.jpg|thumb|right|[[Byron White]] was the senior dissenting justice.]]
Justices White and Rehnquist wrote emphatic dissenting opinions. White wrote:
{{quote|I find nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to support the Court's judgment. The Court simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant women and, with scarcely any reason or authority for its action, invests that right with sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion statutes. The upshot is that the people and the legislatures of the 50 States are constitutionally disentitled to weigh the relative importance of the continued existence and development of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spectrum of possible impacts on the woman, on the other hand. As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has authority to do what it does today; but, in my view, its judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review that the Constitution extends to this Court.&lt;ref name="Doe" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potts, Malcolm et al. ''Abortion'', p. 347 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

White asserted that the Court "values the convenience of the pregnant mother more than the continued existence and development of the life or potential life that she carries." Though he suggested that he "might agree" with the Court's values and priorities, he wrote that he saw "no constitutional warrant for imposing such an order of priorities on the people and legislatures of the States." White criticized the Court for involving itself in the issue of abortion by creating "a constitutional barrier to state efforts to protect human life and by investing mothers and doctors with the constitutionally protected right to exterminate it." He would have left this issue, for the most part, "with the people and to the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs."

Rehnquist elaborated on several of White's points, asserting that the Court's historical analysis was flawed:
{{quote|To reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment. As early as 1821, the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the Connecticut Legislature. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion. While many States have amended or updated their laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today.&lt;ref name="Roe"&gt;''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 174–177 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Currie |first=David |title=The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The Second Century, 1888–1986|volume=2|page=470|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.economist.com/node/4134124 Rehnquist's legacy]", ''[[The Economist]]'' (June 30, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From this historical record, Rehnquist concluded, "There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted." Therefore, in his view, "the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter."

== Reception ==

===Political===
A  statistical evaluation of the relationship of political affiliation to pro-choice and anti-abortion issues shows that public opinion is much more nuanced about when abortion is acceptable than is commonly assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Analysis {{!}} How America feels about abortion|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/04/24/how-america-feels-about-abortion/?wpisrc=nl_draw&amp;wpmm=1|accessdate=April 25, 2017|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of ''Roe'' describe it as vital to the preservation of [[women's rights]], personal freedom, bodily integrity, and privacy. Advocates have also reasoned that access to safe abortion and reproductive freedom generally are fundamental rights. Some scholars (not including any member of the Supreme Court) have equated the denial of abortion rights to compulsory motherhood, and have argued that abortion bans therefore violate the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]:

{{quote|When women are compelled to carry and bear children, they are subjected to 'involuntary servitude' in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment….[E]ven if the woman has stipulated to have consented to the risk of pregnancy, that does not permit the state to force her to remain pregnant.&lt;ref name="Koppelman" /&gt;}}

Supporters of ''Roe'' contend that the decision has a valid constitutional foundation in the Fourteenth Amendment, or that the fundamental right to abortion is found elsewhere in the Constitution but not in the articles referenced in the decision.&lt;ref name="Koppelman"&gt;Koppelman, Andrew.

A prominent argument against the ''Roe'' decision is that, in the absence of consensus about when meaningful life begins, it is best to avoid the risk of doing harm.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Ronald. ''[http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/10456929?tab=holdings Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation]'', (Nelson 1984): "If you don't know whether a body is alive or dead, you would never bury it.

In response to ''Roe v. Wade'', most states enacted or attempted to enact laws limiting or regulating abortion, such as laws requiring [[parental consent]] or parental notification for minors to obtain abortions; spousal mutual consent laws; [[Paternal rights and abortion|spousal notification]] laws; laws requiring abortions to be performed in hospitals, not clinics; laws barring state funding for abortions; laws banning [[intact dilation and extraction]], also known as partial-birth abortion; laws requiring waiting periods before abortions; and laws mandating that women read certain types of literature and watch a fetal ultrasound before undergoing an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Guttmacher Institute, "[http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_OAL.pdf State Policies in Brief, An Overview of Abortion Laws (PDF)]", published January 1, 2007. Retrieved 2007-01-26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Congress passed the [[Hyde Amendment]], barring federal funding of abortions (except in cases of rape, incest, or a threat to the life of the mother) for poor women through the [[Medicaid]] program. The Supreme Court struck down some state restrictions in a long series of cases stretching from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, but upheld restrictions on funding, including the Hyde Amendment, in the case of ''[[Harris v. McRae]]'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Harris v. McRae|volume=448|page=297|pin=|year=1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some opponents of abortion maintain that [[personhood]] begins at [[fertilization]] or [[Conception (biology)|conception]], and should therefore be protected by the Constitution;&lt;ref name="Balkin" /&gt; the dissenting justices in ''Roe'' instead wrote that decisions about abortion "should be left with the people and to the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs."&lt;ref name="Doe"&gt;{{ussc|name=Doe v. Bolton|volume=410|page=179|pin=|year=1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most notable opposition to ''Roe'' comes from Roe herself: In 1995, Norma L. McCorvey revealed that she had become [[pro-life]], and from then until her death in 2017, she was a vocal opponent of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;McCorvey, Norma, with Andy Meisler (1994).

=== Legal ===
Justice Blackmun, who authored the ''Roe'' decision, stood by the analytical framework he established in ''Roe'' throughout his career.&lt;ref name=Blackmun&gt;''Casey'', 505 U.S. at 930–934 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("In sum, ''Roe''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s requirement of strict scrutiny as implemented through a trimester framework should not be disturbed.").&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite his initial reluctance, he became the decision's chief champion and protector during his later years on the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=183–206, 250}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Modern liberalism in the United States|Liberal]] and [[feminist]] legal scholars have had various reactions to ''Roe'', not always giving the decision unqualified support. One argument is that Justice Blackmun reached the correct result but went about it the wrong way.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Balkin|Balkin, Jack]]. [http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/110-8/balkin.pdf Bush v.

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/19/AR2005101901974.html "Support Choice, Not Roe",] ''Washington Post'', (October 19, 2005): "If the best we can say for it is that the end justifies the means, then we have not only lost the argument – but a bit of our soul as well." Retrieved 2007-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], while agreeing with the decision, has suggested that it should have been more narrowly focused on the issue of privacy. According to Stevens, if the decision had avoided the trimester framework and simply stated that the right to privacy included a right to choose abortion, "it might have been much more acceptable" from a legal standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Jeffrey.

A [[Gallup poll]] conducted in May 2014 indicates that 50% of Americans believe that abortions should be legal under certain circumstances, 28% believe abortion should be legal under any circumstances, and 21% believe that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Saad, Lydia.

A [[Gallup poll]] conducted in May 2009 indicates that 53% of Americans believe that abortions should be legal under certain circumstances, 23% believe abortion should be legal under any circumstances, and 22% believe that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances. However, in this poll, more Americans referred to themselves as "Pro-Life" than "Pro-Choice" for the first time since the poll asked the question in 1995, with 51% identifying as "Pro-Life" and 42% identifying as "Pro-Choice".&lt;ref&gt;Saad, Lydia.

In contrast, an October 2007 [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris]] poll on ''Roe v. Wade'' asked the following question:
{{quote|In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that states laws which made it illegal for a woman to have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy were unconstitutional, and that the decision on whether a woman should have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy should be left to the woman and her doctor to decide.

In reply, 56 percent of respondents indicated favour while 40 percent indicated opposition. The Harris organization concluded from this poll that "56 percent now favours the U.S. Supreme Court decision."

== Role in subsequent decisions and politics ==
Opposition to ''Roe'' on the bench grew when President Reagan, who supported legislative restrictions on abortion, began making federal judicial appointments in 1981. Reagan denied that there was any [[litmus test (politics)|litmus test]]: "I have never given a litmus test to anyone that I have appointed to the bench…. I feel very strongly about those social issues, but I also place my confidence in the fact that the one thing that I do seek are judges that will interpret the law and not write the law. We've had too many examples in recent years of courts and judges legislating."&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Ronald. ''[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1986/62386e.htm Interview With Eleanor Clift, Jack Nelson, and Joel Havemann of the Los Angeles Times]'' (June 23, 1986). Retrieved 2007-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to White and Rehnquist, Reagan appointee [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] began dissenting from the Court's abortion cases, arguing in 1983 that the trimester-based analysis devised by the ''Roe'' Court was "unworkable."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health|volume=462|page=416|pin=|year=1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his retirement from the bench, Chief Justice Warren Burger suggested in 1986 that ''Roe'' be "reexamined";&lt;ref name="Thornburgh"&gt;{{ussc|name=Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|volume=476|page=747|pin=|year=1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the associate justice who filled Burger's place on the Court – Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] – vigorously opposed ''Roe''. Concern about overturning ''Roe'' played a major role in the defeat of [[Robert Bork]]'s nomination to the Court in 1987; the man eventually appointed to replace ''Roe''-supporter Lewis Powell was [[Anthony Kennedy]].

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] used the rulings in both ''Roe'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' as grounds to find Canada's federal law restricting access to abortions unconstitutional. That Canadian case, ''[[R. v. Morgentaler]]'', was decided in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1988/1988rcs1-30/1988rcs1-30.html R. v.

=== ''Webster v. Reproductive Health Services'' ===
{{Main article|Webster v. Reproductive Health Services}}
In a 5–4 decision in 1989's ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'', Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, declined to explicitly overrule ''Roe'', because "none of the challenged provisions of the Missouri Act properly before us conflict with the Constitution."&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;{{ussc|name=Webster v. Reproductive Health Services|volume=492|page=490|pin=|year=1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the Court upheld several abortion restrictions, and modified the ''Roe'' trimester framework.&lt;ref name="Webster"/&gt;

In concurring opinions, O'Connor refused to reconsider ''Roe'', and Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] criticized the Court and O'Connor for not overruling ''Roe''.&lt;ref name="Webster"/&gt; Blackmun – author of the ''Roe'' opinion – stated in his dissent that White, Kennedy and Rehnquist were "callous" and "deceptive," that they deserved to be charged with "cowardice and illegitimacy," and that their [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] opinion "foments disregard for the law."&lt;ref name="Webster"/&gt; White had recently opined that the majority reasoning in ''Roe v. Wade'' was "warped."&lt;ref name="Thornburgh"/&gt;

=== ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' ===
{{Main article|Planned Parenthood v. Casey}}

During initial deliberations for ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), an initial majority of five Justices (Rehnquist, White, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas) were willing to effectively overturn ''Roe''. [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]] changed his mind after the initial conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Totenberg|first=Nina|authorlink=Nina Totenberg|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1745254|title=Documents Reveal Battle to Preserve 'Roe'; Court Nearly Reversed Abortion Ruling, Blackmun Papers Show|publisher=NPR|work=Morning Edition|date=March 4, 2004|accessdate=January 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter joined Blackmun and Stevens to reaffirm the central holding of ''Roe'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=203–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying, "Our law affords constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education. [...] These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life."&lt;ref&gt;''Casey'', 505 U.S. at 851.&lt;/ref&gt; Only Justice Blackmun would have retained ''Roe'' entirely and struck down all aspects of the statute at issue in ''Casey''.&lt;ref name=Blackmun/&gt;

Scalia's dissent acknowledged that abortion rights are of "great importance to many women", but asserted that it is not a liberty protected by the Constitution, because the Constitution does not mention it, and because longstanding traditions have permitted it to be legally proscribed. Scalia concluded: "[B]y foreclosing all democratic outlet for the deep passions this issue arouses, by banishing the issue from the political forum that gives all participants, even the losers, the satisfaction of a fair hearing and an honest fight, by continuing the imposition of a rigid national rule instead of allowing for regional differences, the Court merely prolongs and intensifies the anguish."&lt;ref&gt;''Casey'', 505 U.S. at 1002 (Scalia, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' ===
{{Main article|Stenberg v. Carhart}}
During the 1990s, the state of [[Nebraska]] attempted to ban a certain second-trimester abortion procedure known as [[intact dilation and extraction]] (sometimes called [[partial birth abortion]]). The Nebraska ban allowed other second-trimester abortion procedures called [[dilation and evacuation]] abortions. Ginsburg (who replaced White) stated, "this law does not save any fetus from destruction, for it targets only 'a method of performing abortion'."&lt;ref name="Stenberg"&gt;{{ussc|name=Stenberg v. Carhart|volume=530|page=914|pin=958–59|year=2000}} ("The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human adult or child would: It bleeds to death as it is torn from limb from limb. The fetus can be alive at the beginning of the dismemberment process and can survive for a time while its limbs are being torn off.").&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court struck down the Nebraska ban by a 5–4 vote in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' (2000), citing a right to use the safest method of second trimester abortion.

Kennedy, who had co-authored the 5-4 ''Casey'' decision upholding ''Roe'', was among the dissenters in ''Stenberg'', writing that Nebraska had done nothing unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="Stenberg"/&gt; In his dissent, Kennedy described the second trimester abortion procedure that Nebraska was not seeking to prohibit, and thus argued that since this dilation and evacuation procedure remained available in Nebraska, the state was free to ban the other procedure sometimes called "partial birth abortion."&lt;ref name="Stenberg"/&gt;

The remaining three dissenters in ''Stenberg'' – Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas – disagreed again with ''Roe'': "Although a State may permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State must do so."

=== ''Gonzales v. Carhart'' ===
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}
{{Main article|Gonzales v. Carhart}}
In 2003, Congress passed the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]], which led to a lawsuit in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''. The Court had previously ruled in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' that a state's ban on "partial birth abortion" was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception for the health of the woman. The membership of the Court changed after ''Stenberg'', with [[John Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito]] replacing Rehnquist and O'Connor, respectively. Further, the ban at issue in ''Gonzales v. Carhart'' was a clear federal statute, rather than a relatively vague state statute as in the ''Stenberg'' case.

On April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a 5 to 4 decision upholding the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, asserting that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left the door open for as-applied challenges. Kennedy's opinion did not reach the question of whether the Court's prior decisions in ''Roe v. Wade'', ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', and ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' remained valid, and instead the Court stated that the challenged statute remained consistent with those past decisions whether or not those decisions remained valid.

Chief Justice [[John Roberts]], Scalia, Thomas, and Alito joined the majority. Justices Ginsburg, Stevens, Souter, and Breyer dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent, and also offering an equality-based justification for abortion precedent. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in ''Roe v. Wade'' and ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act possibly exceeded the powers of Congress under the [[Commerce Clause]].

The Texas legislature enacted in 2013 restrictions on the delivery of abortions services that created an undue burden for women seeking an abortion by requiring abortion doctors to have difficult-to-obtain "admitting privileges" at a local hospital and by requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities. The Court struck down these two provisions "facially" from [[Texas House Bill 2|the law at issue]] – that is, the very words of the provisions were invalid, no matter how they might be applied in any practical situation. According to the Supreme Court the task of judging whether a law puts an unconstitutional burden on a woman's right to abortion belongs with the courts and not the legislatures.&lt;ref name="20160627SCOTUSDenniston"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/06/opinion-analysis-abortion-rights-reemerge-strongly/|title=Whole Woman's Health v.

=== Activities of Norma McCorvey ===
[[Norma McCorvey]] became a member of the anti-abortion movement in 1995; she supported making abortion illegal until her death in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39016181 |title=Roe v Wade: Woman in US abortion legal test case dies |website=bbc.co.uk |date=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, she testified to Congress:
{{quote|It was my pseudonym, Jane Roe, which had been used to create the "right" to abortion out of legal thin air.

We talked about truly desperate and needy women, not women already wearing maternity clothes.&lt;ref name="testimony"/&gt;}}

As a party to the original litigation, she sought to reopen the case in [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] in Texas to have ''Roe v. Wade'' overturned. However, the [[Fifth Circuit]] decided that her case was moot, in ''[[McCorvey v. Hill]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=McCorvey v.

=== State laws regarding ''Roe'' ===
[[File:Guttmacher Abortion Restrictions.SVG|thumb|upright=1.1|Since 2010 there has been an increase in state restrictions on abortion.]]

Several states have enacted so-called [[trigger law]]s which would take effect in the event that ''Roe v. Wade'' is overturned, with the effect of outlawing abortions on the state level. Those states include Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota and South Dakota.&lt;ref name="Vestal"&gt;Vestal, Christine. [http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2006/06/22/states-probe-limits-of-abortion-policy "States probe limits of abortion policy"], Stateline.org (June 11, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many states did not repeal pre-1973 statutes that criminalized abortion, and some of those statutes could again be in force if ''Roe'' were reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Frances Frank. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5D71738F93BA35754C0A96F948260 "Louisiana Moves Against Abortion"], ''[[New York Times]]'' (July 8, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states have passed laws to maintain the legality of abortion if ''Roe v. Wade'' is overturned. Those states include California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Nevada and Washington.&lt;ref name="Vestal" /&gt;

The Mississippi Legislature has attempted to make abortion unfeasible without having to overturn ''Roe v. Wade''. The Mississippi law as of 2012 was being challenged in federal courts and was temporarily blocked.&lt;ref&gt;LZ Granderson [http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/11/opinion/granderson-mississippi-abortion/index.html?hpt=hp_c1 "Mississippi's end run around abortion"], ''[[CNN]]'' (July 12, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Salomón–Lozano Treaty''' was signed in July 1922 by representatives of [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]]. The fourth in a succession of treaties on the Colombian-Peruvian disputes over land in the upper Amazon region, it was intended to be a comprehensive settlement of the long border dispute between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photius.com/countries/colombia/national_security/colombia_national_security_the_leticia_conflict.html photius] retrieved July 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of a Peruvian attack on the river town of Puerto Córdoba, the treaty made both countries to scale back the number of troops in the region. It essentially created a border between both nations along the [[Putumayo River]]. Also, Colombia recognized Peruvian territorial claims to the Amazon east of [[Ecuador]].

'''Sardinian banditry''' was a criminal phenomenon typical of [[Sardinia]].

==History==
The phenomenon of banditry has a particular importance in the history of Sardinia.
The Code enacted in the reign of [[Carlo Felice]] (1827) stated that: "were reputed bandits that were not declared as such by the public pregone: I already sentenced to the jail; those who investigated the crime of similar major penalty, had already been cited to defend himself, as well as those whose arrest was decreed by the competent court, if it gave to the bush to escape from justice."

A bandit, then, is one who has voluntarily removed from the execution of a command of the law. The Sardinian bandit beats the campaign and commits other crimes.

==The Roman period==
The banditry in Sardinia was already known since the times of the ancient Romans, when it assumed the character of latent "national" rebellion and a social nature. In the Roman period, banditry was primarily [[cattle rustling]] and damage to property.
Often those who practiced it were shepherds, the inhabitants of the mountains; speakers as [[Cicero]] called it ''latrunculi mastrucati''.

==The Judicial and Aragonese period==
[[Eleanor of Arborea]], in her ''Carta de Logu'', authorized unconventional remedies in order to suppress banditry.
In 1477, there is news, though not official, of the first kidnapping for ransom in Sardinia, which occurred in the Baronia of [[Posada, Sardinia|Posada]] between [[Olbia]] and [[Siniscola]].
During the next centuries the phenomenon continued to occur but became particularly evident during the Spanish period.

==The Spanish period==
Beginning in the sixteenth century, the countries were racing from ''homines facinorosos en que van quadrilla'', real gangs like that of Manunzio Fiore.
The phenomenon was of such importance that in 1574 it was ordained a ''Prammatica'' with which they were taken to prevent the formation of gangs and especially to prevent the facilitation of (often by the same landowners) made possible criminal activity.
During the seventeenth century the phenomenon of armed gangs developed further: the countries of [[Sassari]], [[Nuoro]], [[Goceano]] and [[Gallura]], thanks to the nature of the place, became the scene of companies fearsome gangs were soon in a position to compromise seriously public order.

==The Savoy period==
The situation did not change with the advent of the [[House of Savoy]], so, already in 1720, the first measures were enacted for the suppression of the phenomenon.
On March 13, 1759, a ''Regulations for the Administration of the Justice in the Kingdom of Sardinia'' was enacted.
In the second half of the 18th century, in certain areas of the island (such as the [[Gallura]]), banditry was linked to smuggling.
During the first half of the nineteenth century, the banditry was connected with bloody clashes between family clans.
The clashes were interspersed with ''peaces'', practices endorsed by the authorities and that included all the members of rival clans the family heads of villages swearing in church, followed by the granting of pardons and safe-conduct on the part of the authorities.

==The Italian period==
The public peace, unfortunately, was not reached: in the second half of the endemic social crisis, poverty, difficulties in relations with the authorities, led the bandits to appear in ever more features.
In particular, it was practiced by bands formed for the occasion, the ''bardana'', which was an armed expedition to plunder a village, and the ''robbery'', always an armed expedition to capture a country in view of the stripping of a rich owner: did the shot bands melted, making it difficult for the investigators.
The most famous of these expeditions was the one that went down in history as ''the bardana of [[Tortolì]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Floris,''The Great Encyclopedia of Sardinia'', vol.1, The Library of La Nuova Sardegna&lt;/ref&gt;

In the night between 13 and November 14, 1894 a group formed by a hundred horsemen came to Tortolì and besieged the house of a rich owner, Vittorio Depau, killed a servant (wounded by several stab wounds and ended up with a gunshot to the head ) who had fired against the criminals and invaded and raided the house, whose inhabitants had barricaded themselves in a safe in the attic.
The [[carabinieri]] (there were only seven) failed to curb the raid but managed to kill a bandit, whose body was taken away from the others and found a few days later in rural areas of the country stripped and beheaded in order to make it impossible to recognize.
In the firefight was also mortally wounded the Brigadier Pietro Giua.
Around 1875 he reappeared the practice of kidnapping for ransom.
Violence and fear took possession of the countryside. These facts aroused the attention of the Italian Prime Minister [[Francesco Crispi]], who appointed the Sardinian deputy Francesco Pais Serra, to make an inquiry "on the economic conditions and public safety in Sardinia." 
The investigation began to make clear the links between banditry and social situation, but public opinion, deeply disturbed by the situation, negatively influenced the actions of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Angelo De Murtas, ''100 years of our history - 1899-1906 the roots of violence'', vol. 2, La Nuova Sardegna, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
So, while you spread the idea, supported by the positivist school of anthropologists such as Alfredo Niceforo, who [[Barbagia]] banditry was rooted not only endemic, but even genetic, i.e. race,&lt;ref&gt;Niceforo in his essay ''La delinquenza in Sardegna'' (''The delinquency in Sardinia'' - 1897) argued that:'' "The accursed race, that people all over Sardinia, Sicily and southern Italy should be treated equally with iron and with fire, condemned to death as inferior races of Africa and Australia" Alfredo Niceforo, ''La delinquenza in Sardegna'' (1897).''&lt;/ref&gt; the government decided to send army units to [[Nuoro]] to eradicate the problem.
The enterprise is told in the book of the officer Giulio Bechi,''Caccia Grossa'', which aroused bitter controversy (as well as interpretations rather hasty).

At the end of the nineteenth century there were in Sardinia and 197 fugitives were killed 77 policemen in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Floris,''The Great Encyclopedia of Sardinia'', vol.1, The Library of La Nuova Sardegna&lt;/ref&gt;
The decade 1890–1899 can be considered the period of far more serious in the history of banditry in Sardinia. For the number of murders, the number and the unique personality of the fugitives - bandits, for the true carnage of human life (bandits, their victims, police), and the frequency of conflicts which led, especially in [[Barbagia]], a situation not dissimilar to that of war, the decade ended with the intervention of the army stands tragically from any other period in the history of [[Sardinia]] until today.
A noncomprehensive list of fugitives-bandits, many of which in their turn gang-leaders, makes it clear, but certainly not justify the proposal put forward in 1896 by the captain Vincenzo Mauro, to order the immediate arrest of all the joint of the fugitives.
As can be seen from the report of the joint membership, the bandits came almost all from [[Nuoro]], from a limited number of countries [[Barbagia]] and some of the country and of the pastoral area of [[Ogliastra]] and the province of [[Sassari]].
They were:
Giuseppe Pintore; Pietro Sanna; Giovanni Satta Saba; Giovanni Maria Astara; Giovanni Marongiu; Domenico Ruiu; Raffaele Gusai; Giovanni Congiu; Giuseppe Sanna Columbu; Antonio Porcu; Antonio Piroi; Antonio Farina; Elias and Giacomo Sanna Serra of [[Nuoro]]. 
Giuseppe Lovicu; Francesco Rubano; Antonio Soro; Pietro Sini; Pietro Sotgiu of [[Orgosolo]].
Giovanni Mula; Salvatore Pau (accused of 16 murders); Antonio Congiu; Antonio Mulas; Giovanni Corbeddu Salis; Michele Tupponi of [[Oliena]].
Antonio Manconi; Giuseppe Noli Coi; Francesco Reseu; Giuseppe Budroni of [[Orani, Sardinia|Orani]].
Dionigi Mariani; Giovanni Moni; Giuseppe Goddi; Antonio Fenu of [[Orune]].
Giovanni Falconi; the brothers Malucco; Giovanni Piras; Salvatorangelo Catte of [[Fonni]].
Pietro Mameli; Simone Loddo; Gabriele Murgiolu of [[Olzai]].
Ciccio De Rosas; Mario Angius; Sebastiano Chessa of [[Usini]].
Tommaso Virdis and Giovanni Pinna of [[Oniferi]].
Giovanni Lussu and Giovanni Mulas of [[Orosei]].
Paolo Solinas and Bernardino Pirisi of [[Sarule]].
Angelo Mulargia and Giovanni Maria Bomboi of [[Siniscola]].
Diego Doneddu of [[Bitti]]; Quirico Vargiu of [[Buddusò]]; Giuseppe Salis of [[Burgos]]; Vincenzo Fancellu known ''Berrina'' of [[Dorgali]]; Salvatore Carta of [[Orotelli]]; Antonio Fenu of [[Pattada]]; Giovanni Maria Nuvoli of [[Florinas]]; Antonio Sanna Deriu of [[Torralba, Sardinia|Torralba]]; Francesco Campesi of Tula; Giovanni Podda of [[Urzulei]]; Salvatore Dettori of [[Ottana]]; Giovanni Antonio Mulas of [[Osidda]].
The dramatic decade 1890–1899 was characterized by three aspects:
* The high number of murders, almost always related to cattle rustling, road robberies and revenges;
* The fact that the problem that the police had to deal with was not the identification of the culprits, almost all well-known fugitives, but their capture (this fact turned the investigative efforts by the military);
* The impressive frequency of firefights, until the last of ''Morgogliai''.
To give an exact idea of the gravity of the situation it is useful to mention some of the more stirring events.
In 1891, they were kidnapped and released after payment of ransom, the engineers Lombroso and Marignani; authors of the kidnapping were Giuseppe and Pietro Moni from Orune, the fugitive brothers Giovanni and other relatives; Always in 1891 the bandit Ciccio De Rosas of Usini killed on the same day two men and two women, one of them pregnant forwarded; in 1892 were seized the two French timber merchants Pral and Paty; in 1894 began the tragic bandit career of Giuseppe Lovicu, accused of 12 murders, 4 attempted murders and countless robberies, thefts, and damages; on January 15, 1895, a band of eleven outlaws attacking two [[carabinieri]] in the road that leads from the station to the village of [[Oniferi]], intended to rob the payroll of the [[carabinieri]] Lieutenancy, and killed the [[carabiniere]] Antonio Ferrari; in August 1895 was carried out a robbery at the [[Oniferi]] bus: the gang is being chased by the [[carabinieri]] departments, army and ''barracelli'', who set fire to the forest to bring into the open the bandits; all escape from the encirclement, exception of one, who was killed, but before, killing the captain of ''barracelli'' Louis Pirisi, the [[carabiniere]] Mameli and seriously injures the corporal Basilo Porcu and the lance corporal Pietro Sini (which will then be killed in shootout with Serra Sanna gang); in 1898 is killed the famous Corbeddu: near the body, the rifle of Major Spada, the commander of the [[Carabinieri]] Division of [[Sassari]] the first time that Corbeddu had attacked and robbed, leaving him half-naked in the street; 1892–1898, in seven years, were killed by bandits a [[Carabinieri]] lieutenant, a sergeant, 4 sergeants and 14 [[Carabinieri]].
In July 1899, the captain Petella, to create a vacuum around the fugitives, is organizing what may be considered the most grandiose police operation in the history of [[Italy]], arrested 500 people in a single night in the district [[Nuoro]]-[[Ozieri]]; the process will be celebrated with 682 defendants burdened with 237 titles imputation. in the same month of July 1899, in the place ''Morgogliai'', between [[Oliena]] and [[Orgosolo]], 50 [[Carabinieri]] and an entire battalion of infantry engages in a real battle against the gangs of Serra Sanna, Virdis, Pau and Lovicu: all the bandits are killed to except Lovicu that will later killed in a shootout with the [[Carabinieri]] in [[Oliena]] in 1901.
The ''conflict of Morgogliai'' and killing of fugitive fed the illusion of having put an end to banditry only because they had eliminated the most dangerous gangs.

But the roots of the phenomenon were not even touched by them and, after a brief lull, the bandits will draw new food, giving rise to periodic outbreaks of crime.

==The first decades of the 1900s and the fascist period==
At the end of the century the government had sent the army, but did not prevent the annihilation of the bands that just eight years later, in 1907, unleashed the ''Disamistade'' (feud), which resulted in 20 murders in just [[Orgosolo]].
On the eve of [[World War I]], the situation is not likely to improve: in 1913 will be made 4 murders, 70 attempted murders, 21 robberies followed by murder and simple robbery 138. 
The First World War interrupted for a short time the robbery, which resumed after the war raging and the harsh repression, the confinement of police and executions of [[fascism]] can not contain.
After the death of Samuele Stochino, [[Fascism]] proclaims that banditry was extirpated.
It is extirpated from the newspapers of propaganda, but not from the confidential reports of the Fascists Prefects and the Questors.
The fugitives multiply: Flores, Pietro Liandru, Ganga, Corsi, Floris, Cheri, Puddu of [[Sarule]], Antonio Pintori, Giovanni Chironi said ''Praticheddu'', Modolo of [[Orani, Sardinia|Orani]], are the most formidable that appear in the quarterly reports of the Prefects. 
From a statistic of the Police of [[Nuoro]] is noted that in the four years from 1932 to 1935, only in the province of [[Nuoro]], were committed 49 murders, 181 robberies, two kidnappings; figures probably below the true because in another document signed by the Superintendent Pumo recording 10 murders, 59 robberies and a kidnapping only in the first eight months of 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Ignazio Pirastu,'' Sardinia under investigation - The report of Ignazio Pirastu on Sardinian crime'', Banditi e Carabinieri, The Library of La Nuova Sardegna.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the Second World War==
After the doldrums of [[World War II]] banditry explodes again with appalling violence. 
In August 1949, in [[Villagrande Strisaili]], and in September 1950, nine kilometers from [[Nuoro]], were carried out two robberies, during which eight [[Carabinieri]] were killed and one blinded.
January 15, 1950 were killed the father and son Arangino, a few kilometers from [[Tonara]].
In 1950, only in [[Orgosolo]], were committed 13 murders.
In 1952, on the way to [[Ozieri]] a robbery that took place can be considered the most sensational of the century: on the very day in which they celebrated the Anniversary of the [[Carabinieri]], a dozen gunmen stopped and robbed 240 people for blocking two hours three courier and more than ten cars and fleeing with the loot undisturbed.
A few months later, four kilometers from [[Nuoro]], was killed on a Roman merchant Patalacci who had not stop to order of bandits. 
On 6 November 1953 on the highway [[Orosei]]-[[Dorgali]] five masked bandits kidnapped 20 people, loaded on two trucks and transported for approximately 20 kilometers, passing through the outskirts of [[Dorgali]], big center in the province of [[Nuoro]].
It released nineteen and held prisoner the engineer Capra. The episode culminated with the death of the victim.
The seizure Capra aroused emotion and clamor throughout [[Italy]].
On April 30, 1954, at 12&amp;nbsp;km from [[Nuoro]], in the same area where he was killed Patalacci, which is carried out a robbery of romance.
Around noon, four bandits kidnap the debt collector Putzolu that passed with two of his employees.
The Putzolu had already been seized under the same conditions, roughly in the same place, ten months before.
The bandits had imposed Putzolu to send the driver in [[Nuoro]] to bring the ransom money;
instead the driver had warned the [[Carabinieri]] that they had not had time to catch the robbers, but had arrived in time to save the life of the hostage.
Ten months later the same bandits stopped again Putzolu.&lt;ref&gt;were the same because presented to the debt collector the checks that they had removed the first time.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The bandits threatened to kill the hostage if the driver does not return within an hour at most. 
The driver this time does not inform the [[Carabinieri]] and returns the sum; the bandits leave the Putzolu free and unharmed. 
From 1955 to 1965 followed by another decade of stagnation and then suddenly a new upsurge shakes and bloody Sardinian countries, with a frightening frequency of kidnappings and armed conflicts, in which 23 people were killed, including 5 agents of Public Security.
It can also be a random coincidence, but the fact is that the overwhelming upsurge of banditry of the years 1966-1969, beginning 4–5 years after the law n. 588 on the ''Piano di Rinascita'' (Plan of Rebirth), in the years when it begins to appear clearly the ineffectiveness of this latter.
The law is of June 1962. 

In 1966, the banditry explodes with between 81 murders and attempted murders, 67 robberies, 19 attempted robberies, 55 extortions, 11 kidnappings.
On August 12, 1966 was seized in the territory of [[Orgosolo]], a 14-year-old boy, Giuseppino Vedele, who was held captive for 14 days in the hollow of a large tree.
In 1967, four kidnappings were carried out in the month of August.
In three years (1966–1968) were carried out 33 kidnappings for ransom, exactly 11 every year, the highest number ever in the history of Sardinian banditry and never achieved in any country in the world.
In August 1972, in [[Lanusei]], six bandits enter in the house of the doctor Vincenzo Loddo. The first to notice the bandits is his wife who gets scared and starts to scream.
The bandits lose his head and start shooting.
Are killed in the shootout, the doctor, his brother, his wife, a nephew and one of the bandits.
The tragic fact is remembered as ''the massacre of [[Lanusei]]''.
In July 1979, on the beach of ''Sa rena bianca'' (''The white sand'') in [[San Pantaleo]] ([[Olbia]]) are kidnapped Luigia and Cristina Cinque, mother and daughter, from [[Milan]]; will be held hostage for 80 days before being released in [[Nuoro]] after payment of a ransom of 550 million lire.
On 19 August 1979, he was kidnapped in [[Umbria]] (the first kidnapping was made outside of [[Sardinia]]), [[Guido Freddi]], who was then 13 years old. It brought in a niche carved out between the bushes, covered with a tarp. He was released after 28 days in a parking lot of the [[Autostrada del Sole]], near [[Magliano Sabina]].

On 27 August of that same year, in [[Tempio]], are kidnapped the two most famous victims of kidnapping in [[Sardinia]]: the singer-songwriter [[Fabrizio De André]] and his girlfriend and future wife [[Dori Ghezzi]].
Are kept for 107 days chained inside a tent in the [[Monte Lerno]], in [[Pattada]].
Are released near [[Benetutti]] after paying ransom of 550 million lire.
The fact inspire you to [[Fabrizio De André]] the song ''Hotel Supramonte''.
Always caused a sensation in 1979 kidnapping of the two brothers Giorgio and Marina Casana, from [[Turin]], picked up on the beach by a group of 15 offenders on August 22 and released on October 21, after payment of a ransom.
In November 1983, he was kidnapped in [[Nuoro]] the pharmacist Gina Manconi. Would never return home.
On 17 January 1985, an unprecedented fact happens in the panorama of kidnappings in [[Sardinia]]: Tonino Caggiari is kidnapped, a small business owner of [[Oliena]].
For his release mobilize not only to significant law enforcement agencies (Police, [[Carabinieri]], Guardia di Finanza), but also a substantial group of citizens, villagers of Caggiari, mostly shepherds, who wanted to collaborate with the police.
There was a tremendous firefight in the territory of ''Osposidda'' between [[Oliena]] and [[Orgosolo]], where four fugitives were killed Giovanni Corraine, Giuseppe Mesina, Nicolò Floris from Orgosolo and Salvatore Fais said ''Speedy Gonzales'', from [[Santulussurgiu]], and the cop Vincenzo Marongiu of [[Mogoro]]. This shootout will go down in history as ''The Battle of Osposidda''.
On October 20, 1990, he was seized entrepreneur Giovanni Murgia of [[Dolianova]]. It's kept hidden for three months in a hole dug in a slope.
He was released the following year in the countryside of [[Telti]] after paying a ransom of 600 million lire.
The 15 January 1992 to [[Pantogia]] near [[Porto Rotondo]], is kidnapped the little [[Farouk Kassam]], son of [[Fateh Kassam]] a French-born Egyptian, owner of a hotel. The kidnappers carry the baby in the [[Supramonte]], and moving from one place to another always keeping it hidden in caves carved into the rock reinforced with stone walls and covered with earth. To convince parents to pay the ransom, they cut a piece of an ear. The story of the little [[Farouk]] moved all [[Italy]].
The 10 July of that same year, was found in good health by the [[police]] near a dry stone wall in the place ''Iriài'', between [[Orgosolo]] and [[Dorgali]].
You'll find out later (between endless arguments) that Farouk Kassam was released through the mediation of [[Graziano Mesina]].
In December 1994 he was kidnapped at the intersection of [[Borore]], the contractor Vinci.
Is held for almost a year before being released in October, after payment of a ransom of 4,000,000,000 lire.
In May 1995 he was kidnapped at [[Abbasanta]], Vanna Licheri that after 4 months of seizure falls ill and dies.&lt;ref&gt;are 33 in all the hostages that will no longer return home.&lt;/ref&gt;
On 17 June 1997, in [[Manerbio]], in the province of [[Brescia]] (another kidnapping made in Peninsula) is kidnapped the industrial entrepreneur Giuseppe Soffiantini.
He was locked up in various hideouts in [[Calvana]] and the [[Prato]] mountains, where he was held in inhumane conditions for 237 days. It is one of the longest and most particular kidnappings occurred in  [[Italy]], and which fortunately was successful by virtue of the payment of a ransom of well 5,000,000,000 lire.
During two different firefights during the kidnapping, were killed the fugitive Mario Moro from [[Ovodda]] and the police inspector of NOCS, Samuele Donatoni.

In 1997, he was kidnapped in [[Tortolì]], Silvia Melis, daughter of engineer Tito Melis; is found in good condition on the road [[Nuoro]]-[[Orgosolo]].
On 28 May 2007 he was released the entrepreneur of [[Bonorva]], Giovanni Battista Pinna said ''Titti''. Even his father, had earlier threatened kidnapping, while a relative of his, who was also kidnapped never returned home.
With laws that block the payment of ransom, the arrest of the fugitives and the best control of the territory, has drastically reduced the phenomenon of kidnapping.
However, the crime has not disappeared, even from "rural" has evolved and has become "urban". The most common forms of crime of the 2000s are: the assault on transport vehicles and at ATMs with a lot of bulldozers and drug trafficking.

==The new course of banditry==
In the years 1966–1969, in the face of appalling frequency of kidnappings there were those who argued that this was to be considered as a new fact of [[Sardinia]]n banditry, who was to give the impression of being in front of a new crime, the type of "gangster" and then to causes other than those of the past, no longer connected with the structure and conditions of the countryside of the island.
After the seizure of the little Ghilardi and awesome revenge killings or followed a failed kidnapping attempt, the businessmen Ghitti in [[Ottana]] and missing a few kilometers from [[Cagliari]], some publicists claimed, with polemical vigor, that the explanations of the phenomenon no longer had no current value. Those explanations, he wrote, were perhaps valid and useful to understand banditry "romantic" of the past, but the current and completely new, different and alien to social and economic motives. 
It is worth mentioning that even some prefects of the [[Fascist]] regime stressed several times that at the root of crime in rural [[Sardinia]] were the economic and social conditions of the inland areas; telegafico in a brief report sent to the Italian Ministry of the Interior, July 14, 1933, by the Prefect of [[Nuoro]] Chiaromonte was written verbatim: 
"... Means radicals can not recognize that measures of social and economic development of long-range, according to various reports contained in my reports, but in the meantime it is essential to fairly distribute public works next winter season, giving preference those character sanitary et et postponing school buildings beautification works."&lt;ref&gt;Ignazio Pirastu,'' Sardinia under investigation - The report of Ignazio Pirastu on Sardinian crime'', Banditi e Carabinieri, The Library of La Nuova Sardegna.&lt;/ref&gt;
The thesis of the ''new course'' of Sardinian banditry is based on the claim that in order to characterize different from the banditry of the past, "traditional", are essentially three aspects:
* The particular cruelty of the bandits, who have come to kidnap a child and even kill without pity some of those who have resisted the kidnapping;
* The fact that the bandits commit crimes solely for profit, which distinguishes them from the bandits of the past and must make them consider the ''gangster'' as there are in other parts of [[Italy]] and the world;
* The fact that the perpetrators of the kidnappings have chosen their vittme not only among the landowners, but also among the industrialists, merchants and wealthy men (or supposed) and small businessmen of the city.
That would deny the nature of "rural" or "sheep-farming" of the phenomenon.
It is true that the three aspects which underpin the thesis of the ''new course'' of banditry have characterized the criminal manifestations seriously after years of the ''Piano di Rinascita'' (Plan of Rebirth);
is not true is that they are ''new'' aspects of banditry island.
Quite the contrary is true: the bandits in the past, the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth century, they committed their crimes with ruthlessness inconceivable; not only kidnapped, but they kidnapped and then murdered boys and girls; few exceptions, acted for profit and not spare traders, businessmen and wealthy people living in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Ignazio Pirastu,'' Sardinia under investigation - The report of Ignazio Pirastu on Sardinian crime'', Banditi e Carabinieri, The Library of La Nuova Sardegna.&lt;/ref&gt;

The real ''new course'' of crime in [[Sardinia]] has since the mid-1960s with the collusion with subversive and politicians movements and the reinvestment of the ransom money in other criminal activities such as drug trafficking.

==Collusion of the banditry with the Sardinian political subversion==
The season of politics subversion, active in [[Italy]] since the early postwar years, it expanded in [[Sardinia]] in the mid-sixties and ended in the eighties, the late lead also in the peninsula.
The contacts between the local bandits and militants of the extreme left and subversive organizations active in the ''red terrorism'', such as the [[Brigate Rosse]] and Nuclei Armati Proletari, were partly helped by the detention of militant left-wing extremists in maximum security prisons on the island, in a manner similar to how [[Sicilian Mafia]] members imprisoned in [[northern Italy]] began colluding with and influencing local Northern Italian criminal groups near their prisons, giving birth of the [[Mala del Brenta]].

The most famous terrorist movements and paramilitary forces, who were born on the island, were '' Barbagia Rossa'', ''Moviment Armato Sardo'' and ''Comitato di Solidarietà con il Proletariato Prigioniero Sardo Deportato'' (Committee of Solidarity with the Sardinian Deported Proletariat Prisoner), in the majority of [[Communism|communist]] and [[Sardinian nationalism|independentist]] ideology, within a decade claimed several attacks and kidnappings.
Among the main supporters of the separatist and subversive because there was the publisher [[Giangiacomo Feltrinelli]], who repeatedly tried to make contact with various organizations with the intention of making independent [[Sardinia]] (with the help of pro-independence) and form a communist government (with the help of the subversive left) on the model approached by [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;Gnosis magazine of Italian intelligence, Sardinia, political laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;
Taking into consideration the election of [[Graziano Mesina]], the most notorious bandit of the crime of [[Sardinia]], as the head of the rebel troops, an idea that was actually optioned by both subversive left as shown by the various contacts that have taken place by the secret services.
In August 2004, we have news of a failed bomb attack, in [[Porto Rotondo]], against the Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], during the visit of British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in [[Sardinia]].
This fact led to the arrest of 10 members of a separatist movement, called ''Organizzazione Indipendentista Rivoluzionaria'' (Independence Revolutionary Organization) and some elements belonging to the ''Nuclei Proletari per il Comunismo.''

==The figure of the bandit==
Sardinians in the late nineteenth century began to hatch feelings of revenge and rebellion against authority.
It is these feelings created the idealization of the figure of the bandit, seen not as a criminal, but as a hero and a liberator. After all, they called themselves fighters.
The wrongs which the bandit revenge, they were considered a defense against bullying and ill-treatments revenge was considered justice if not a duty.
And here was formed in the figure of the people bandit-hero.
The economist Giorgio Todde told of a bandit who jumped into a river to save a [[carabiniere]] who had fallen while chasing him; this contributed to the growing admiration for these characters.
Even [[Antonio Gramsci]] said he had been fascinated when he was young by the figure of Giovanni Tolu, the bandit of [[Florinas]] made famous by writer and journalist Enrico Costa from Sassari and from that of Francesco De Rosas.
[[Sebastiano Satta]] felt admiration for the bandits ''beautiful, fierce and brave.''
The figure of the outlaw was also shot on the intellectuals.
The Congressman Francesco Pais Serra wrote in his report:
Even today, the legendary ''Sardinian bandit, perhaps more fabulous than true, attracts a mixture of romantic strength, brutal revenge and set of chivalric generosity naive minds of the people and a halo of sympathy naive, but tenacious, surrounds the head of him who, alone and weak, it is believed not fight against the right of society, but the claim against violence and bullying staff and authority: he knows how to use the cunning against the force, draw fierce and exemplary vengeance of whoever opposes, but protects those who, like him weak, protects and defends it.''
And it was so in fact, for the poor people who suffered the abuses of those who held the wealth and power.
Girolamo Sotgiu in his ''History of Sardinia after the Unification'', it calls into question ''a small group of owners, that with a basic but efficient system of blackmail imposed his will to the community''. It was they, in fact, that the great majority of the population, peasants and shepherds could have land and labor, and so it was clear they wanted to obey if you physically get the chance to live."&lt;ref&gt;Angelo De Murtas '' 100 years of our history - 1899-1906 the roots of violence'', vol. 2, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
These characters also had control of the City Council and then at their command you could not subtract.
In a nutshell, the bandit was the poor man who rebelled against the rich.
Among the bandits ''romantic'' include:
Bastiano Addis Tansu, said ''Il Muto di Gallura'', made famous by the writer Enrico Costa; Giovanni Tolu of [[Florinas]];&lt;ref&gt;which, ever the writer Enrico Costa, devoted a [[biographical novel]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni Corbeddu Salis]] of [[Oliena]], called ''The Kingof the bush''; the Serra Sanna brothers, especially his sister Mariantonia, called ''Sa reina'' (The queen) in the nineteenth century.
Samuele Stochino of [[Arzana]]; Pasquale Tandeddu of [[Orgosolo]]; Giuseppino Càmpana said ''Rubinu'', of [[Orune]]; [[Graziano Mesina]] said ''Gratzianeddu'', of Orgosolo; Matteo Boe, ''the cold-eyed bandit'' of Lula, [[Attilio Cubeddu]] of [[Arzana]] in the ''[[Anonima sarda]]'' and Giovanni Farina of [[Tempio]] in the twentieth century.
The facts prove incontrovertibly that in reality, banditry "romantic" has never existed in [[Sardinia]]; it's just happened that some writers and poets have described the key romantic and they did rise to false emblem of individual cases of banditry bandits who began their career with a tragic crime of honor or a Vendetta for wrongs but that almost all, they ended up robbing and killing for profit.
Who says that the brutality is one of the distinguishing factors of the ''new course'', unaware apparently some chilling episodes of the past that is worth remembering.
In 1899, the two bandits of [[Orune]], Giovanni Moni and Giuseppe Goddi, killed a farmer of [[Benetutti]] in the presence of his wife and child; the disemboweled, quartered it, the detached head that they laid on a dry stone wall and the blood that was dripping with the curled mustache.
The bandit Ciccio De Rosas of [[Usini]], killed on the same day November 4, 1891, the doctor Giuseppe Michele Melis of Usini, Antonio Secchi and two women, Maria Antoinetta Sotgia and Clotilde Coco, one of which was in an advanced state of pregnancy. 
On 20 February 1897 the Italian Crown Prosecutor in [[Nuoro]], Nonis, in a public speech were somehow figure of the fugitive that, reads, ''&lt;&lt;lives of crops, robberies and thefts, which quenches the thirst of human blood capriciously, which ambushes macchiasenza to expose themselves, which does not shy away from the extreme cowardice to reunite with many others like him troublemakers, to give the agent the death of the police...&gt;&gt;''
Another Italian Crown Prosecutor in [[Nuoro]], Marcialis, so called bandits in his inaugural speech of the judicial year 1900 
''&lt;&lt;This hyenas always thirsty for human blood, this monsters, which should cancel the memory ...&gt;&gt;''
The truth is that the brutality has always characterized the banditry in Sardinia:
On January 3, 1937 in the territory of [[Benetutti]], Giovanni Pala of [[Orune]], with an ax smashed the skull of the young [[Andrea Bellina]], 17 years old, as she slept; Samuele Stochino in 1928, the famous bandit of [[Arzana]], killed with a shot at point-blank Assunta Nieddu, a 10-year-old girl.
In 1960 in [[Orgosolo]], the kidnapped Pietrino Crasta was killed by his captors with a boulder that crushed his head;&lt;ref&gt;the case of the seizure Crasta is linked to the origin of the absconding of [[Graziano Mesina]]&lt;/ref&gt;
in the New Year's Eve of 1966, to [[Ollolai]], the fugitive Antonio Casula and his associates massacred the spouses Podda, sixties, and their grandson Michele of 11 years.
The same applies with regard to the kidnapping of strangers to the sheep-farming world: in January 7, 1925 was seized a girl of 10 years, [[Wanda Serra]], daughter of the mayor of [[Aidomaggiore]], for which it was requested a ransom of 40,000 pounds, then reduced to 30,000.
The child was found dead; authors were identified in the parish of [[Aidomaggiore]], don Spanu, and Peppa Ziulu.
July 6, 1933 were kidnapped the mayor of [[Bono]], Pietro Molotzu, his wife, his daughter Maria, the teacher Pietrina Marongiu and the notary Ena; the kidnappers left all free except for the little Maria, 7 years old, for which demanded a ransom of 250,000 lire silver coins. The girl skeleton was found after more than a year.
The authors discovered and arrested, they were bandits Congiu of [[Bottidda]], Chironi of [[Nuoro]] and the [[Pintore]] brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Ignazio Pirastu,'' Sardinia under investigation - The report of Ignazio Pirastu on Sardinian crime'', Banditi e Carabinieri, The Library of La Nuova Sardegna.&lt;/ref&gt;
With regard to the fury of revenge, the German traveler [[Joseph Fuos]] in a letter of 1773 wrote: 
''&lt;&lt;If a Sardinian vowed to another deadly hatred, there is no way to escape the fulfillment of this curse, that or go out of the country, or to slay the opponent. It is said, therefore, a Sardinian who followed him to his enemy to Naples, where he took refuge: it seems like there was reconciled with him, and led him to the tavern and the brothel, and stabbed him in the act here venereum, to kill, as he said, not only his body, but also eternally damn his soul. Now he tells this idea even more, but who attributed it to a Sardinian, has basically met the favorite passion of the people, and knew that their thirst for vengeance goes to the most extreme limits to which a man can get her.'' 
''So it is not uncommon for a Sardinian is not content to kill his enemy, but he also abuses his body with bites, cuts and dismemberment, in the most compassionate way, that just recently took place in Sassari and there two heinous examples [...].'' 
''How different is also the way of thinking of men! If I say to a Sardinian in my homeland a murderer must die without hope grace at the hands of justice, it does the sign of the cross and says that I was born in a cruel people. But if this same Sardinian killed half a dozen men because of miserable disputes, and sworn death to another half dozen (and similar cases in this country if it finds more than one) he will not find anything cruel. &gt;&gt;'' &lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fuos,'' Nachrichten aus der gegenwärtingen Verfassung Sardinia von dieser Insel'', 1773.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banditry and economy situation==
Assuming that banditry was somehow connected to a feudal society and an economy based on archaic farming yet contemplated the ritual of transhumance, and grazing (considered as causes of criminal activity), they tried to make changes the social-economic structure, impact of Sardinia by different laws.
In the nineteenth century it was introduced the ''Edict of Chiudende'', which included the enclosure of land uncultivated pasture, to benefit the development of an agricultural economy and sedentary activities. It was introduced private property.
In 1887 a severe economic crisis linked to the customs bloc with the [[France]] (main importer of cattle from the island) struck the [[Sardinia]]. This increased the deep latent discontent in the country, which resulted in the bloody events that shook the [[Barbagia]] in the last decade of the nineteenth century.
In the early twentieth century were introduced industries for the production of cheese; the shepherd was transformed from master-merchant in keeper-milker. Thus was born the figure of the ''shepherd servant''.
In the beginning of the sixties was passed the Law on the ''Piano di Rinascita'' (''Plan of Rebirth''), which included the installation of factories in order to modernize an agricultural-pastoral economy to an industrial society.
Although most of the laws for the betterment of the economy has not obtained the expected success and banditry has not eradicated, it is good to mention that in some areas where it was a process of transformation, we saw almost disappear or this phenomenon. 
This is the case of [[Gallura]], that from the seventeenth century to the first half of the nineteenth century was the area most devastated by criminal incidents; after changing from nomadic to sedentary pastoral guidance, the [[Gallura]] banditry underwent an inflection up, almost to disappear altogether.
Ignazio Pirastu, in his report also cites the example of the village of [[Oliena]], according to a study done by Dr. Panico. 
The study has shown that the processes of rapid change of the regime and crop landowner paid equally rapid extinction of the phenomenon.
In the conclusions of the investigation it is said: "The argument that an intensive agrarian transformation and the resulting improved economic conditions, has paid [[Oliena]] a regression of the sheep-farming and a drop in crime is fully proven by the investigation conducted on the spot. The agrarian transformation in [[Oliena]] occurred in two periods: from 1934 to 1939 and 1945 to 1960.
Consequently, it was noted a steady reduction of the sheep-farming: 40,000 sheep from the 1900 ran to 15,000 in 1951 and 10,000 in 1955.
In this period we had in [[Oliena]] an overall decrease of the crimes, both against the person and against property. 
The thesis is then confirmed by a reverse phenomenon, occurring from 1960 to 1969. 
In this period it is in fact registered in [[Oliena]] an increase in crimes against the person and against property than in previous decades. This increase corresponds to a recovery of the sheep-farming. In fact, after the 1956 is a gradual increase in sheep and goats [[Oliena]] that, from 10,000 in 1955, rising to 21,000 in 1964 and, further, to 24.589 at the end of 1967." 
Another test is made by the radical change in behavior of the colonies of the shepherds of [[Barbagia]] that have moved to other [[Italy]] regions and who have distinguished themselves, in general, hard work and honesty.&lt;ref&gt;Ignazio Pirastu,'' Sardinia under investigation - The report of Ignazio Pirastu on Sardinian crime'', Banditi e Carabinieri, The Library of La Nuova Sardegna.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Securities Commission''' was an independent [[Crown entity]] of the government of [[New Zealand]] and the main regulator of investments.  It was replaced on 1 May 2011 by the [[Financial Markets Authority (New Zealand)|Financial Markets Authority]].

It was responsible for enforcement, monitoring and market oversight of the securities markets, authorising participants and promoting public understanding of investments.  This included authorising the [[New Zealand Stock Exchange]] with which it ran a co-regulatory model.

On 27 April 2010 the New Zealand minister for commerce [[Simon Power]] announced that Securities Commission would be replaced by a new integrated financial regulator the Financial Markets Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10641503 |title=One financial regulator to rule them all |publisher=NZ Herald |date=29 Apr 2010 |first=Adam |last=Bennett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission was first established under the Securities Act 1978 which determines its powers and functions.

The commissions role was modified and extended by a number of additional pieces of legislation.  These include the Securities Markets Act 1988, the Investment Advisers (Disclosure) Act 1996, the Securities Regulations 1983, the Securities Act (Contributory Mortgage) Regulations 1988, and the Securities (Fees) Regulations 1998.

The Financial Advisers Act 2008 gave the Securities Commission new responsibilities to register and set minimum standards for financial advisers.  There was some concern that the commission did not have the resources to effectively carry out its responsibilities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0909/S00664.htm Securities Commission needs staff, money and IT]&lt;/ref&gt; and that this additional responsibility would make the situation worse.

The agency was chaired by Jane Diplock from 2001 until it was disbanded in 2011 and faced criticism for its handling of the collapse of a large number of finance companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goodreturns.co.nz/article/976495596/diplock-defends-commission-over-fin-coy-failures.html |publisher=Good Returns |title=Diplock defends commission over fin coy failures |date=September 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jane Diplock was also the chairperson of the [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) during her time as chairperson of the Securities Commission.

==Responsibilities and functions==
The Securities Commission undertook the following roles: 
* Enforcement, monitoring and market oversight 
* Law reform 
* Exemptions 
* Authorisations 
* International co-operation and
* Promoting public understanding

==Notable cases==
* In May 1993 the Commission published a very extensive report on the manipulation of reported profits by the largely Government owned Bank of New Zealand. "Arrangements" to make the manipulation look valid were put in place in March 1988 but in the event they were not used until the Banks 1990 year when the Bank's profit was overstated by $55m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.justaccounting.co.nz/reca.pdf |title= Report of an Enquiry into Certain Arrangements entered into by Bank of New Zealand in March 1988  |date=24 May 1993 |publisher=New Zealand Securities Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2007, [[Michael Fay (banker)|Michael Fay]] and [[David Richwhite]] through one of the companies that they co-owned, Midavia Rail Investments, paid $20 million to the commission to settle [[insider trading]] proceedings relating to [[Tranz Rail]]. In October 2004 the commission accused Midavia of insider trading and Richwhite of tipping off Midavia to sell $63 million worth of shares while knowing Tranz Rail was facing financial problems, which was not known to the public. The commission noted that the payments had been made "without any admission of liability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

*On 11 November 2007 the NZ Securities Commission issued a report&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justaccounting.co.nz/seccomfeltex2.html|title=Feltex Carpets Ltd IPO Prospectus Financial Reporting and Continuous Disclosure|last=|first=|date=11 November 2007|website=Justaccounting|publisher=NZ Securities Commission|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; into two matters concerning Feltex Carpets Ltd which by then had gone into liquidation with the probable loss of all shareholders funds. The first matter was an Initial Public Offer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justaccounting.co.nz/feltexpros.pdf|title=Feltex Carpets Prospectus|last=|first=|date=April 2004|website=|publisher=Feltex Carpets Ltd|access-date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; made in April 2004 by which a sole shareholder sold all its shares to the public for about $250m. The report declared that this IPO was not misleading in any material particular. Nevertheless over three thousand of the eight thousand subscribers to this IPO have taken legal action against various parties associated with making the offering on the grounds that the offering was misleading. The High Court (Houghton v Saunders)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chapmantripp.com/publications/Documents/Houghton%20v%20Saunders.pdf|title=Houghton v Saunders|last=|first=|date=|website=Chapman Tripp|publisher=High Court|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found against the shareholders and as at April 2016 the matter is being considered by the Court of Appeal.

:In the second matter the Securities Commission reported that Feltex had overstated the length of tenure of most of its extensive bank debt in its half yearly report to 31 December 2005. The Ministry of Economic Development took legal action against five of the Feltex directors as a result of this Securities Commission report but in MED v Feeney Judge M Doogue dismissed the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chapmantripp.com/publications/Documents/2011%20PUB%20BC%20Directors%20backsides%20exposed%20if%20noses%20in%20fingers%20out.pdf|title=Directors Backsides Exposed|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Chapman Tripp|access-date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Doogue specialized in family court matters. Less than a year after this judgement she was promoted to Chief District Court Judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/district/district/the-judges/judge-chief|title=Chief District Court Judge|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Justice Department|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On 20 June 2010, the Securities Commission put the [[Financial institution|finance company]] ''South Canterbury Finance'' which was run by [[Allan Hubbard (businessman)|Allan Hubbard]] into statutory management after complaints from a number of investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* In late 2010, the Securities Commission successfully applied to the [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] to have the assets of former director of [[Financial institution|finance company]] [[Hanover Finance]], [[Mark Hotchin]] frozen.&lt;ref name="frozen"&gt;{{cite news

In American law, a '''signing agent''' or '''courtesy signer''' is an agent whose function is to obtain a formal signature of an appearer to a document.  In common parlance, most jurisdictions require the appearer to sign before a [[notary public]]. From this, the practice of a notary public designating themselves as a signing agent has arisen. There are notaries public who specialize in the notarization of [[real estate]] transfer and loan document signings. Signing agents often have certification and training through private organizations, but is not a requirement in law, although it may be a requirement of the lender in the oversight of real estate transaction document signatures.

Also referred to as a ''notary signing agent'' or a ''loan signing agent'', a signing agent should not be confused with a [[mortgage loan closer|mortgage loan closer or closing agent]]. Signing agents are notaries public, who usually have experience and/or training concerning the proper execution of loan documents and are hired by mortgage companies, escrow companies, title companies, and signing services to identify loan documents, obtain the necessary signatures, and in some cases deliver the documents to the borrower. A signing agent is an impartial party to the transaction, and must adhere to the notary laws of their state or jurisdiction. In some states of the United States where signing agents are allowed, signing agents may identify documents and can point out terms to the loan transaction.  However, signing agents are prohibited from giving legal advice or in any way explaining or interpreting the meaning of any terms or documents, and they are not permitted to prepare the documents, or alter them in any way.  Any advice, explanation, or opinion can be considered unauthorized practice of law, except in the State of Louisiana, which is governed by Civil Law; in Louisiana, civil law notaries public have broad powers, and can actually prepare documents and discuss them with the signers.

The American Signing Agents Association Inc defines the signing agent as, "A signing agent is a trusted professional, usually a state commissioned notary public, that performs the closing ceremony for real estate transactions, mortgage loan transactions, legal process transactions and other similar transactions where an independent third part is requested.  A signing agent should insure that they are disinterested in the transaction and have a mutual obligation to all parties to remain objective, neutral to any position, insure awareness of document contents by affiant and make a reasonable effort to prevent fraud and protect affiants from coercion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americansigningagents.org/home/standards/what-is-a-signing-agent American Signing Agents Association Inc: ''What is a Signing Agent'', 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410084313/http://www.americansigningagents.org/home/standards/what-is-a-signing-agent |date=2013-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TV Everywhere''' (also known as '''authenticated streaming''' or '''authenticated video on-demand''')&lt;ref name="verge-starzplay"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/8/3473290/starz-play-encore-play-cox-streaming-video | title=Starz Play and Encore Play 'authenticated' streaming video now available for Cox customers | publisher=Vox Media | work=The Verge | date=October 8, 2012 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Ingraham, Nathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a [[business model]] wherein access to [[streaming video]] content from a television channel requires users to "authenticate" themselves as current subscribers to the channel, via an [[user account|account]] provided by their participating [[pay television]] provider, in order to access the content.

Under the model, broadcasters offer their customers the ability to access content from their channels through [[Internet television|internet-based]] services and [[mobile app]]s—either live or [[Video on demand|on-demand]], as part of their subscription to the service. [[Time Warner Cable]] first proposed the concept in 2009; in 2010, many television providers and networks began to roll out TV Everywhere services for their subscribers, including major networks such as [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] and [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] (whose owner was an early supporter of the concept), [[ESPN]], and [[HBO]] among others. Broadcast television networks have also adopted TV Everywhere restrictions for their online content.

Television providers and broadcasters have touted the advantages of being able to access content across multiple platforms, including on the internet, and on [[mobile device]]s (such as [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]]) as part of their existing television subscription. The TV Everywhere concept has received criticism for being difficult for end-users to set up, while media activists have criticized the concept for being a [[paywall]] that extends the existing [[oligarchy]] of the subscription television industry to the internet, and considering it to be [[collusion]] against [[cord cutter]]s—those who drop cable and satellite entirely in favor of accessing content via terrestrial television, the internet, and subscription [[video on demand]] (SVOD) services.

== Rationale ==
TV Everywhere services were developed in an attempt to compete with the [[market trend]] of [[cord cutting]], where consumers drop traditional pay television subscriptions in favor of accessing TV content exclusively through over-the-air television and/or online on-demand services, including [[Hulu]], [[Netflix]], [[YouTube]], and other sources. Authenticated streaming and video on-demand services allow traditional television providers to directly compete with these competitors, and add value to existing television subscriptions in an effort to retain subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/business/media/23couch.html?_r=1&amp;ref=sofa_wars | title=In the Living Room, Hooked on Pay TV | work=The New York Times | date=August 23, 2010 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Matt, Richtel | author2=Stelter, Brian}} {{subscription needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcn-critical/&gt;

In particular, broadcasters and providers have emphasized the use of TV Everywhere services to allow [[multi-platform]] access to their content, on devices such as personal computers, [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer|tablets]], [[digital media player]]s, and [[video game console]]s.&lt;ref name="mcn-critical"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.multichannel.com/content/how-critical-tv-everywhere | title=How Critical Is TV Everywhere? | publisher=NewBay Media | work=Multichannel News | date=October 17, 2011 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Spangler, Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Precursors ===
[[ESPN Inc.|ESPN]] first introduced a TV Everywhere-like concept with [[ESPN360]], a service which allowed users to stream [[Broadcasting of sports events|sports programming]] from its networks either live or on-demand through a website. However, access to ESPN360 was restricted to the users of [[internet service provider]]s who had negotiated deals with ESPN to offer the service; a model closer in nature to cable television carriage. Similar tactics were soon used by several other channels, such as [[NFL Network]] (who used the technique to restrict access to its ''Game Extra'' service for ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'') and [[Epix (TV network)|Epix]]. David Preschlack, ESPN's executive vice president for affiliate sales and marketing, foresaw a future in the model, believing that access to exclusive content would soon play a greater role in competition between high-speed internet providers. However, the model was deemed a violation of the principles of [[net neutrality]] by some critics.&lt;ref name="wired-espntoisps"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/2009/02/espn-stands-fir/ | title=ESPN to ISPs: Pay for Your Customers to Play Video | publisher=Condé Nast | work=Wired | date=February 5, 2009 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Buskirk, Eliot Van}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-tvforeveryone/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired-360neutrality"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/business/2009/06/cable-isps-see-net-neutrality-foul-in-espn-online-video-charges/ | title=Cable ISPs See Net Neutrality Foul in ESPN Online-Video Charges | publisher=Condé Nast | work=Wired | date=June 12, 2009 | accessdate=January 5, 2014 | author=Singel, Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Introduction and adoption ===
In 2009, [[Time Warner Cable]] announced an initiative known as ''TV Everywhere'', a set of principles which were "designed to serve as a framework to facilitate deployment of online television content in a way that is consumer friendly, pro-competitive."&lt;ref name="ars-comcastexpand"/&gt; The concept would enable users of their respective cable television services to access live and on-demand online content from channels that they subscribe to by using an account-based authentication system. TWC CEO [[Jeffrey Bewkes]] believed that the TV Everywhere principles were "good concepts" that are "likely to be the general direction for all TV networks and all the distribution connections that are out there."&lt;ref name="ars-tvforeveryone"/&gt; That summer, both TWC and [[Comcast]] began trials of services based on the system; [[Turner Broadcasting]] was an early supporter of the system, providing access to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] and [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] content as part of the trials. Comcast officially launched a public beta of its TV Everywhere-based portal, Xfinity Fancast, in December 2009 for all double-play television and internet customers. Afterwards, other providers began to follow suit.&lt;ref name=mcn-critical/&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-tvforeveryone"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/06/is-comcast-and-timewarners-tv-everywhere-tv-for-everyone/| title=Is Comcast and Time Warner's "TV Everywhere" TV for everyone? | publisher=Condé Nast | work=Ars Technica | date=June 24, 2009 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Lasar, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-comcastexpand"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2009/12/comcast-expands-online-video-to-all-cableinternet-customers/ | title=Comcast expands online video to all cable+Internet customers | publisher=Condé Nast | work=Ars Technica | date=December 15, 2009 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Cheng, Jacqui}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, broadcasters and television providers began a wider roll-out of TV Everywhere-based services; for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], [[NBC Sports]] offered live and video on-demand access to events throughout the Games that required users to authenticate for access.&lt;ref name="sbj-testcase"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2009/04/20090413/This-Weeks-News/Olympics-A-Test-Case-For-Web-Video.aspx | title=Olympics a test case for Web video? | publisher=Advance Publications | work=Sports Business Journal | date=April 13, 2009 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Ourand, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in February, [[HBO]] launched HBO Go, a video on demand service exclusive to HBO subscribers on participating providers.&lt;ref name="engadget-hbogo"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/topics/hd/2010/02/17/eyes-on-with-hbo-go/ | title=Eyes-on with HBO GO | publisher=AOL Inc. | work=Engadget | date=February 17, 2010 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Drawbaugh, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] would begin launching an array of TV Everywhere-based services, including [[WatchESPN]] (a successor to ESPN360 offered to ESPN television subscribers), and similar apps for [[Disney Channel]] and [[Disney XD]].&lt;ref name="mcn-modelforfuture"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://multichannel.com/news/policy/comcast-disney-deal-model-future/264273 | title=Comcast-Disney Deal a Model for Future | publisher=NewBay Media | work=Multichannel News | date=January 9, 2012 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Reynolds, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] became the first over-the-air network to restrict on-demand access with a TV Everywhere-based system; "next day" on-demand episodes (either through its website or [[Hulu]], itself a joint venture between Fox, [[NBC]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] at the time) would only be available online to users authenticating themselves as a subscriber to a cable or satellite provider, or those who subscribe to the Hulu Plus service. All other users would be subject to an 8-day delay.&lt;ref name="nyt-foxhulu"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/business/media/fox-to-limit-next-day-streaming-on-hulu.html | title=Fox to Limit Next-Day Streaming on Hulu to Paying Cable Customers | work=The New York Times | date=July 26, 2011 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Stelter, Brian}} {{subscription required|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, 2011, fellow Fox property [[Big Ten Network]] (a [[college sports]] network dedicated to the [[Big Ten Conference]], operated in partnership with [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]) also launched a TV Everywhere service known as ''BTN2Go''.&lt;ref name="btn2go-mcn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://multichannel.com/news/cable-operators/btn2go-kicks-four-distributors/327365 | title=BTN2GO Kicks off with Four Distributors | publisher=NewBay Media | work=Multichannel News | date=September 1, 2011 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Renyolds, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion ===
Matt Strauss, Comcast senior vice president of digital and emerging platforms, considered the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] to be a "watershed" event for TV Everywhere services; [[NBCUniversal]] announced that a total of nearly 10 million authenticated devices accessed its online coverage during the Games across both the NBCOlympics.com site and NBC Olympics Live Extra app; in particular, parent company Comcast accounted for 3.3 million devices from 1.5 million users.&lt;ref name="mcn-watershed"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://multichannel.com/news/cable-operators/comcasts-strauss-2012-olympics-were-tv-everywhere-watershed-event/326328 | title=Comcast's Strauss: 2012 Olympics Were 'TV Everywhere' Watershed Event | publisher=NewBay Media | work=Multichannel News | date=August 14, 2012 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Spangler, Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Games, the service was rebranded as NBC Sports Live Extra to serve as a general streaming app for the [[NBC Sports]] division.&lt;ref name="engadget-nbcliveextra"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/09/01/nbc-rebrands-olympics-app-as-nbc-sports-live-extra-promises-str/ | title=NBC rebrands Olympics app as NBC Sports Live Extra, promises streams for a wider athletic universe | publisher=AOL Inc. | work=Engadget | date=September 1, 2009 | accessdate=April 19, 2014 | author=Fingas, Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TV Everywhere services also began to appear in Canada in the early 2010s, with the Canadian launch of [[HBO Canada|HBO Go]] in 2012,&lt;ref name="thr-hbogocanada"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hbo-go-mobile-app-headed-274232 | title=HBO Go Mobile App Headed to Canada | publisher=Prometheus Global Media | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=December 15, 2011 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Vlessing, Etan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2013 announcement of TV Everywhere services from [[Bell Media]] (beginning with [[Bravo (Canada)|Bravo Go]], and also including [[CTV Television|CTV Go]]) and [[Shaw Media]] (beginning with [[Global Television Network|Global]]).

In May 2013, ABC released its Watch ABC [[mobile app]], which allows viewers on participating providers to access live streams from participating ABC affiliates.&lt;ref name="variety-watchabc"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/abc-to-stream-live-via-app-1200479778/ | title=ABC to Stream Live Via App | publisher=Penske Media Corporation | work=Variety | date=May 12, 2013 | accessdate=June 1, 2013 | author=Wallenstein, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engadget-watchabc"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/31/watch-abc-app-kindle-fire/ | title=Watch ABC app with live TV streaming comes to Kindle Fire, but not Google Play | publisher=AOL Inc. | work=Engadget | date=May 31, 2013 | accessdate=June 1, 2013 | author=Lawler, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, ABC confirmed that it would impose a similar restriction to Fox for "next day" on-demand episodes beginning on January 6, 2014, with 7-day exclusivity for authenticated users and Hulu Plus subscribers.&lt;ref name="variety-abclimit"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/abc-to-limit-new-episodes-online-to-paying-subscribers-starting-jan-6-1201015862/ | title=ABC to Limit New Episodes Online to Paying Subs for One Week | publisher=Penske Media Corporation | work=Variety | date=December 31, 2013 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Spangler, Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC unveiled its own plans for a similar TV Everywhere app to its affiliate board in April 2014.&lt;ref name="nbc-tveaffiliates"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/nab-nbc-unveils-tv-everywhere-app-affiliates/130344 | title=NAB: NBC Unveils TV Everywhere App for Affiliates | publisher=NewBay Media | work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable | date=April 7, 2014 | accessdate=May 25, 2014 | author=Malone, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, after negotiations surrounding [[revenue sharing]] and infrastructural mandates (including a proposed requirement that the games only be available through the league's existing apps), [[Major League Baseball]] reached a three-year deal with Fox to allow it to offer in-market online streaming on Fox Sports Go (though streamed using [[MLB Advanced Media]] infrastructure) for the 16 teams that it holds regional rights to through the [[Fox Sports|Fox Sports Networks]] division.&lt;ref name=sbj-foxinmarket&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB, Fox break impasse in streaming talks|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2015/08/17/Media/MLB-streaming.aspx|website=Sports Business Journal|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcn-inmarket&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB, RSNs Yet To Bridge In-Market Streaming Differences|url=http://www.multichannel.com/mlb-rsns-yet-bridge-market-streaming-differences/389010|website=Multichannel News|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sbj-mlbinmarket&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB, Fox Sports Agree To Three-Year Deal For In-Market Game Streaming, Beginning In '16|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2015/11/20/Media/MLB-Streaming.aspx|website=Sports Business Journal|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, [[Discovery Communications]], a long hold-out on the concept, launched Discovery Go, a centralized TV Everywhere service and mobile app for [[Discovery Channel]], [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]], as well as its array of sister networks.&lt;ref name=mcn-discoverygo&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery Bows TV Everywhere App|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/discovery-bows-tv-everywhere-app/395629|website=Multichannel News|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The TV Everywhere concept has been met with mixed reception. Some broadcasters were initially hesitant to introduce TV Everywhere services, with concerns that they might affect advertising revenue and not be adequately counted by [[Nielsen ratings]].&lt;ref name=mcn-critical/&gt; [[Songwriters Guild of America]] president Rick Carnes praised the TV Everywhere concept and other recent developments for helping to provide easier, legal access to premium content online.&lt;ref name="ars-plottokill"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/01/tv-everywhere-causing-controversy-everywhere/ | title=TV Everywhere: gift to consumers or plot to kill online TV? | publisher=Condé Nast | work=Ars Technica | date=January 6, 2010 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Lasar, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media activists have criticized the concept as protecting the existing [[closed platform|closed]], regionalized [[oligarchy]] of multichannel television by tying digital content to traditional television subscriptions, thus harming fully [[over-the-top content|over-the-top]] competitors. [[Public Knowledge]] believed that "under the 'TV Everywhere' plan, no other program distributors would be able to emerge, and no consumers will be able to 'cut the cord' because they find what they want online. As a result, consumers will be the losers."&lt;ref name=ars-tvforeveryone/&gt; A 2010 report by [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]] made similar arguments, contending that TV Everywhere was an act of [[collusion]] by the cable industry, and arguing that "by tying programming to local cable subscriptions, while denying content to pure online TV distributors, the incumbent industry hopes to artificially reproduce the lack of competition for TV distribution to which it is accustomed, based on geographical fiefdoms and turf."&lt;ref name="ars-plottokill"/&gt; The [[NCTA (association)|NCTA]] denied many of Free Press' arguments, stating that it was "an effort to ensure more content than ever is distributed over the Internet at no extra charge to consumers."&lt;ref name="ars-plottokill"/&gt;

In July 2014, BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield criticized the video on demand services offered through TV Everywhere systems for being ad-supported. In examples from [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] and [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]], he noticed that ads often repeated, and that in TNT's case, its version of an episode of ''[[The Last Ship (TV series)|The Last Ship]]'' included 20 minutes of unskippable ads across 45 minutes of programming. In conclusion, he contended that viewers would rather wait for programs to appear on subscription streaming services rather than use TV Everywhere services.&lt;ref name="deadline-ads"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/07/tv-everywhere-ads-repeat-video/ | title=What's The Problem With TV Everywhere?

=== Viewer awareness ===
[[File:TV Everywhere generic logo.svg|thumb|right|180px|The Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association for Marketing introduced a logo ''(pictured)'' intended for marketing TV Everywhere services.]]
Despite efforts by broadcasters to educate viewers on TV Everywhere services and how to utilize them (including Fox, which produced a promotional video starring [[Jane Lynch]] as her ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' character [[Sue Sylvester]], describing the process as being less painful than [[waterboarding]]),&lt;ref name=atd-foxwaterboarding/&gt; critics and end-users criticized the registration and authentication processes for being frustrating and difficult. In response, providers took steps to improve their user experiences; [[Disney]] reported that use of its TV Everywhere services increased after it simply changed its process to use the term "verify" instead of "authenticate", [[Comcast]] and [[Cablevision]] introduced systems that automatically verify users with their [[residential gateway]]s, and Synacor (a provider of authentication platforms used by providers) added the ability for users to link their provider account to a [[Social networking service|social network]] [[OAuth|login]], such as Facebook or Twitter.&lt;ref name=mcn-watershed/&gt;&lt;ref name="atd-foxwaterboarding"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://allthingsd.com/20110727/signing-up-for-foxs-new-web-tv-plan-isnt-as-hard-a-being-waterboarded/ | title=Using Fox's New Web TV Plan Isn't as Hard as Being Waterboarded | publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company | work=All Things Digital | date=July 27, 2011 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Kafka, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atd-synacorsocial"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://allthingsd.com/20120906/exclusive-synacor-to-offer-tv-everywhere-authentication-via-social-ids/ | title=Exclusive: Synacor to Offer TV Everywhere Authentication Via Social IDs | publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company | work=All Things Digital | date=September 6, 2012 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Swisher, Kara}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atd-nbcpainful"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://allthingsd.com/20120605/nbcs-olympic-web-video-plan-live-legal-and-painful/ | title=NBC's Olympic Web Video Plan: Live, Legal and "Painful" | publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company | work=All Things Digital | date=June 5, 2012 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Kafka, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and [[2014 Winter Olympics]], NBC worked closer with providers to help educate users, and produced customized marketing materials and video tutorials featuring [[Carson Daly]] (2012) and [[Ryan Seacrest]] (2014) to help inform users. As an incentive, NBC also allowed authenticated users to enter a sweepstakes to win a trip to London (2012) or [[Rio de Janeiro]] (2014).&lt;ref name="mcn-nbc1000sochi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://multichannel.com/news/content/nbc-olympics-present-1000-live-stream-hours-sochi/356709 | title=NBC Olympics to Present 1,000 Live-Stream Hours from Sochi | publisher=NewBay Media | work=Multichannel News | date=December 16, 2013 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Reynolds, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcn-medal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.multichannel.com/mahttp://multichannel.com/news/marketing/nbcu-looks-medal-tv-everywhere-olympic-authentication/289449rketing/nbcu-looks-medal-tv-everywhere-olympic-authentication/139203 | title=NBCU Looks to Medal with TV Everywhere Olympic Authentication | publisher=NewBay Media | work=Multichannel News | date=July 16, 2012 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 | author=Reynolds, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, with dissatisfaction with the system and the [[nbcfail|quality of NBC's overall coverage]], there was an increase in the use of [[virtual private network]] (VPN) services to access the more comprehensive online coverage of the Games being provided by broadcasters in Canada ([[CTV Olympics|CTV]] in London, [[Olympics on CBC|CBC]] in Sochi) and the United Kingdom ([[BBC Sport|BBC]]), which only used [[geoblocking]] and did not require TV Everywhere authentication.&lt;ref name="gigaom-nbcvpn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gigaom.com/2012/08/09/olympics-nbc-authentication-vpn/ | title=Olympic winners: How NBC's authentication helped VPN providers | work=Gigaom | date=August 9, 2012 | accessdate=March 12, 2014 | author=Roettgers, Janko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gandm-cbcvpn"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/olympics/some-us-viewers-turn-to-cbc-amid-complaints-about-nbcs-olympic-coverage/article16790846/ | title=Some U.S. viewers turn to CBC amid complaints about NBC's Olympic coverage | work=The Globe and Mail | date=February 10, 2014 | accessdate=March 12, 2014 | author=Szklarski, Cassandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association for Marketing (CTAM) unveiled an industry-wide initiative for marketing and educating subscribers about TV Everywhere services provided by broadcasters and providers; these efforts include a stylized "tv everywhere" logo which the organization intends providers to use as a unified brand to denote TV Everywhere services. The logo consists of interlocking rectangles, representing multiple "screens" (platforms) for viewing content. The association also provided design recommendations for TV Everywhere user experiences, aiming to alleviate the confusion that had been experienced by users during the authentication process.&lt;ref name="mcn-ctamlogo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/cable-operators/getting-know-tv-everywhere/373810 | title=Getting to Know 'tv everywhere' | publisher=NewBay Media | work=Multichannel News | date=April 14, 2014 | accessdate=May 25, 2014 | author=Gibbons, Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcn-ctamtve"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.multichannel.com/cable-show-2014-ctam-hopes-demystify-tv-everywhere/374300 | title=Cable Show 2014: CTAM Hopes to Demystify TV Everywhere | publisher=NewBay Media | work=Multichannel News | date=May 1, 2014 | accessdate=May 25, 2014 | author=Walsten, Jessika}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adoption ===
In a December 2013 survey of 4,205 pay television subscribers, [[NPD Group]] found that 21% of them used a TV Everywhere service at least once per month, and that 90% of them were satisfied with the experience. NPD analyst Russ Crupnick felt that "aggressive" use of the model was helping to counter cord cutting, which "speaks to the level of engagement they have with programming and a comfort in using the Internet to both access and interact with that programming."&lt;ref name="mcn-npdsurvey"/&gt; The study also found that 3 out of 10 pay television subscribers who were also subscribed to an SVOD service used TV Everywhere services at least once a week (in comparison to 2 out of 10 for those who were not).&lt;ref name="mcn-npdsurvey"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/tv-everywhere/study-21-pay-tv-subs-use-tv-everywhere-monthly/374386 | title=Study: 21% Of Pay-TV Subs Use TV Everywhere Monthly | publisher=NewBay Media | work=Multichannel News | date=May 6, 2014 | accessdate=May 25, 2014 | author=Baumgartner, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid criticism of NBC's coverage, adoption of NBC's TV Everywhere services during the 2014 Winter Olympics was still significantly large: on February 21, 2014, coverage of the [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics&amp;nbsp;– Men's tournament#Semifinals|Men's hockey semi-final featuring the U.S. and Canada]] recorded the largest Live Extra audience in NBC Sports history, with 2.12 million unique viewers, augmenting the average [[NBCSN]] television audience of 3.9 million.&lt;ref name="mcn-menshockeyrecord"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://multichannel.com/news/content/us-canada-men-s-hockey-semifinal-sets-streaming-record-nbc-sports-digital/356118 | title=U.S.–Canada Men's Hockey Semifinal Sets Streaming Record For NBC Sports Digital | publisher=NewBay Media | work=Multichannel News | date=February 21, 2014 | accessdate=March 12, 2014 | author=Baumgartner, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcn-nbcsnratings"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://multichannel.com/news/content/winter-olympics-nbcsn-scores-highest-rated-hockey-game-ever-canada-us-semifinal/356112 | title=Winter Olympics: NBCSN Scores Highest-Rated Hockey Game Ever with Canada-U.S. Semifinal | publisher=NewBay Media | work=Multichannel News | date=February 22, 2014 | accessdate=March 12, 2014 | author=Reynolds, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN's coverage of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] drew similarly heavy online viewership: during a group stage match between the U.S. and Portugal, at least 1.7 million concurrent viewers were using WatchESPN (though, not all of the viewers were necessarily watching the game).&lt;ref name="engadget-17millionespn"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/06/26/watchespn-brings-in-1-7-million-concurrent-viewers-for-usa-vs-germany/ | title=1.7 million people were using WatchESPN during the U.S. vs. Germany World Cup match | publisher=AOL Inc. | work=Engadget | date=June 26, 2014 | accessdate=June 27, 2014 | author=Wollman, Dana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, research firm [[GfK]] estimated that 53% of the United States' pay television subscribers have used a TV Everywhere service—an increase from 42% in 2012, that overall use had doubled since 2012, and 79% of those surveyed found the login process easy. However, only 25% of those surveyed were aware of the term "TV Everywhere" or the CTAM logo, leading to the firm believing that consumer awareness and education was still a "critical missing piece" in the adoption of these services.&lt;ref name=bc-awarenesschallenge&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Everywhere Unknown But Being Used More|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/tv-everywhere-unknown-being-used-more/146453|website=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Platform non-neutrality ===
In 2014, [[Comcast]] was criticized for its decision to arbitrarily block access to [[HBO Go]] on [[PlayStation]] and [[Roku]] devices, but still allowing its use on competing [[Apple TV]] and [[Xbox 360]]. Comcast similarly blocked access to [[Showtime Anytime]] on Roku as well. A spokesperson for the provider stated that "with every new website, device or player we authenticate, we need to work through technical integration and customer service which takes time and resources. Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize as we partner with various players."&lt;ref name=verge-comcasthbogo/&gt;

During both the FCC's [[net neutrality]] hearings and comments regarding Comcast's then-proposed merger with [[Time Warner Cable]] (which, by contrast, allows HBO Go access on all supported devices), Roku criticized the provider for contradicting the TV Everywhere concept by discriminating against specific devices, thus prioritizing its own on-demand platform over external services. The company argued that providers could selectively favor certain platforms over others, further stating that "a large and powerful [[Multichannel video programming distributor|MVPD]] may use this leverage in negotiations with content providers or operators of streaming platforms, ultimately favoring parties that can either afford to pay for the privilege of authentication, or have other business leverage that can be used as a counterweight to discriminatory authentication."&lt;ref name=verge-comcasthbogo&gt;{{cite web|title=Comcast isn't letting customers watch HBO Go on PlayStation 3|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/5/5474850/comcast-isnt-letting-customers-watch-hbo-go-on-ps3|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-hbogocomcast/&gt;

On December 15, 2014, Comcast enabled the ability to use HBO Go and Showtime Anytime on Roku devices.&lt;ref name=ars-hbogocomcast&gt;{{cite web|title=Comcast to stop blocking HBO Go and Showtime on Roku streaming devices|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2014/12/comcast-to-stop-blocking-hbo-go-and-showtime-on-roku-streaming-devices/|website=Ars Technica|publisher=Condé Nast Digital|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Comcast still blocked HBO Go on PlayStation consoles until December 2016.&lt;ref name=verge-comcast-hbogo-ps4&gt;{{cite web|title=Surprise: Comcast won't let anyone watch HBO Go on PlayStation 4|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/5/8156025/comcast-blocks-hbo-go-sony-ps4|website=The Verge|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/07/comcast-finally-allows-hbo-espn-streaming-via-playstation-4/|title=Comcast finally allows HBO, ESPN streaming via PlayStation 4|work=Engadget|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Password sharing ===
There have been instances of users deliberately sharing their TV Everywhere login credentials, or having them sold without their owner's knowledge on the [[black market]], in order to allow others to view programs without subscribing to the channel. [[Charter Communications]] CEO Tom Rutledge, and ESPN's executive vice president for affiliate sales and marketing Justin Connolly, have considered this practice equivalent to [[pirate decryption|piracy]]. In December 2017, it was reported that television providers and program distributors have begun to implement measures in order to discourage this practice, including reducing the length of login session, reducing the number of concurrent streams allowed on a single account, and monitoring unusual usage patterns such as large numbers of concurrent streams on a single account—especially those originating from outside of the customer's region, or during major programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/cable-tv-s-password-sharing-crackdown-is-coming|title=Cable TV’s Password-Sharing Crackdown Is Coming|date=2017-12-20|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the provisions of the [[United Kingdom]] [[Housing Act 2004]] every [[landlord]] or [[letting agent]] that takes a [[tenancy deposit|deposit]] for an [[assured shorthold tenancy]] in [[England and Wales]] must protect the deposit under an authorised '''tenancy deposit scheme'''. The regulations came into effect on 6 April 2007, and were amended by the [[Localism Act 2011]], taking effect from 6 April 2012. The [[Deregulation Act 2015]] further amended the regulations from 26 March 2015.

==Reasons for introduction==
It is common for landlords to take a dilapidation deposit from a tenant at the start of the tenancy. The deposit acts as a safeguard should the tenant cause any damage to the property. Some unscrupulous landlords are either very slow to return deposits at the end of the tenancy or make unfair deductions. The purpose of the regulations is to ensure good practice in this area, and try to keep disputes between landlords and tenants out of the courts by encouraging [[alternative dispute resolution]].

==Description==
The tenant pays over the deposit (commonly one month's rent) in the usual way when the tenancy agreement is signed. The landlord or letting agency has 30 days from receipt of the deposit to provide the tenant with details of the scheme that they are using (known as the prescribed information). If there is no dispute at the end of the tenancy the deposit will be returned to the two parties as agreed. If a dispute has arisen then the parties will be invited to make use of the alternative dispute resolution process that is provided free within the scheme. Should the parties opt for alternative dispute resolution they will be bound by its decision with no redress to the courts.

There are two types of protection scheme:

– Custodial-based

– Insurance-based

The Custodial-based scheme is provided by the Deposit Protection Tenancy. It is free to use and the landlord or letting agents can simply pay the deposit online or over the phone. The money is held in a bank account by the Deposit Protection Scheme and transferred directly to the tenant once both parties agree on the total sum of money to release. Landlords based overseas must use the custodial Deposit Protection Service scheme unless they employ a British-registered letting agent to manage the tenancy.

When the deposit is under an insurance-based scheme, the Landlord or the letting agent will hold the deposit, but have to pay a fee to ensure the landlord will not illegally hold the deposit at the end of the tenancy. If at the end of the tenancy the landlord does not release the deposit, the insurance will pay back the tenant. This scheme is provided by deposits or the Tenancy Deposit Scheme.

==Schemes==
{{As of|2016|November}} three companies are authorised by the UK government to run tenancy deposit schemes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tenancy deposit protection|url=https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-deposit-protection/overview|website=gov.uk|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[https://www.tenancydepositscheme.com/ The Tenancy Deposit Scheme (TDS)]
*MyDeposits
*The Deposit Protection Service (The DPS)

TDS was the original tenancy deposit scheme - established in 2003 which many agents and landlords volunteered to use prior to the introduction of the legislation.
Initially, the DPS offered only a custodial scheme while the TDS and MyDeposits offered only an insurance-backed scheme. From April 2013, the DPS also offered an insurance-backed scheme, and from April 2016, the TDS and MyDeposits both started offering a custodial scheme. Between April and September 2013, [[Capita]] also operated an insurance-backed scheme. Deposit protected by Capita was subsequently transferred to MyDeposits.

==Enforcement==
If a landlord or letting agent does not both protect a tenant’s deposit and provide the tenant with the prescribed information within 30 days then they are prevented from regaining possession of the property under a Section 21 notice under the Housing Act 1988, unless the deposit is first repaid or proceedings for a penalty against the landlord, or its agent, has been initiated and settled.

If the tenant applies to court for the deposit to be protected and it is shown the landlord is not compliant with the scheme, then the court must order the landlord to pay the tenant between one and three times the deposit amount within 14 days.

Non-protection of a deposit taken before the commencement of the regulations on 6 April 2007 does not result in a penalty, but no valid Section 21 notice may be served until the deposit has been protected.

===Pre-2012 cases===
* Tiensia v Vision Enterprises Ltd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/1224.html | title = Tiensia v Vision Enterprises Ltd (t/a Universal Estates) &lt;nowiki&gt;[2010]&lt;/nowiki&gt; EWCA Civ 1224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; - deposit registered after 14-day deadline
* Gladehurst Properties Ltd v Hashemi - deposit never registered during tenancy
* Draycott v Hannels - deposit registered after 14-day deadline
* Harvey v Bamforth - deposit registered within 14 days but information not provided

The defences in these cases are affected by the [[Localism Act 2011]], which made the following changes to the law affecting deposit registration:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/notes/division/5/7/6/4 | title = Section 184: Tenancy deposit schemes, Explanatory notes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deadline for registration and providing prescribed information changed from 14 to 30 days following payment of the deposit
* Penalties for non-compliance apply even if the registration is done late
* Grants the court discretion to award 1x to 3x the deposit amount as a sanction, instead of 3x in all cases
* The penalties for non-compliance apply even once the tenancy has ended

==Claims process==
Either a Landlord or a tenant may begin the claims process from 14 days after the end of the tenancy.&lt;ref name="DPS"&gt;[https://www.depositprotection.com/help/browse/agent-landlord/agent-single-claim-process Deposit Protection Service ] Retrieved October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The first step in beginning a claim is to obtain a so-called Statutory Declaration by accessing the Landlord or tenant's online account, and starting the process using an online form.&lt;ref name="DPS"/&gt; Once a claim has begun, the dispute service in question makes contact with both parties notifying them of the dispute, and requesting any additional evidence, before the claim is referred to an [[alternative dispute resolution]] service, unless either party states that they do not wish to use the ADR service or notifies in writing that they wish to resolve the dispute in the [[county court]]s, or alternatively another dispute resolution service.&lt;ref name="DPS"/&gt;

==Localism Act 2011==
The Housing Act left open a loophole for landlords and letting agents. Although there was a penalty for not protecting the deposit or issuing prescribed information, there was no penalty for not doing so within the original 14 day limit. To close this loophole, the Localism Act 2011 extended the time limit for protecting tenancy deposits from 14 to 30 days, and this limit became absolute. Therefore, on the 31st day after the payment of the deposit money to the landlord the tenant can make an application to the court if the money has not been protected and the prescribed information given. Even if the deposit is registered or the prescribed information is given at any time after the 30-day window the tenant still has a right to make a claim. The claim will be for the return of the full sum of the deposit along with a penalty of between one and three times the sum of the deposit, to be awarded at the discretion of the Court. Tenants can also now make an application to a county court for a penalty award after the tenancy has ended.&lt;ref&gt;The Tenancy Deposit Scheme http://www.tds.gb.com/resources/files/The%20Housing%20Act%202004%20and%20the%20changes%20introduced%20by%20the%20Localism%20Act%202011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
There are a number of “no deposit” or “zero deposit” schemes in operation that are provided by insurance companies. These can offer landlords protection without having to take a deposit.

[[Bond scheme (housing)|Bond schemes]] are an alternative for those unable to afford a deposit. They are commonly used as a homelessness prevention measure.

'''Ukrainian nationality law''' is the law of [[Ukraine]] which concerns [[citizenship]]. The body of law is primarily regulated by the Law of Ukraine on Citizenship of Ukraine and certain provisions within the  [[Constitution of Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.ua/mfa/en/273.htm |title=Citizenship |accessdate=2008-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012012209/http://www.mfa.gov.ua/mfa/en/273.htm |archivedate=October 12, 2012 |df= }}.

''Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine''.&lt;/ref&gt; The current law was adopted by the [[Verkhovna Rada]] after the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 1990|election]] of 26 July 1990 together with the [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine|Declaration of State Sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="Ukraine proclaims sovereignty UW"&gt;[http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1990/299001.shtml Ukraine proclaims sovereignty], ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'' (July 22, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C8C3xuqd6aMC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=Declaration+of+State+Sovereignty+of+Ukraine+July&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZkaSQ4sbLAhXIwBQKHVv-DFcQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Declaration%20of%20State%20Sovereignty%20of%20Ukraine%20July&amp;f=false How Ukraine Became a Market Economy and Democracy] by [[Anders Åslund]], [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]], 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-88132-427-3}} (page 21)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of Ukrainian citizenship==
Citizens of Ukraine typically fall into at least one of the following categories:
* Former citizens of the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] who were permanently resident on the territory of the former [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] at the moment of the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]] on August 24, 1991.
* Stateless people, residing on the territory of Ukraine on November 13, 1991.
* People who came to Ukraine with the intent of taking up permanent residence since 13 November 1991 and who had the endorsement "Citizen of Ukraine" inserted into their 1974-type [[passport of the USSR|Soviet passport]] by Ukrainian authorities, as well as the children of such persons who arrived in Ukraine together with their parents, provided that they had not attained their majority before their entry to Ukraine.
* People who acquired Ukrainian citizenship in accordance with the laws of Ukraine and the international treaties of Ukraine.

==Acquisition of citizenship==
[[File:Ukrainian passport 2017.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The front cover of a biometric Ukrainian passport.]]
[[Image:Ukrainian_biometric_passport_data_page.jpg|thumb|200px|right|International travel biometric [[Ukrainian passport|passport]] details page]]
Citizenship of Ukraine may be acquired in any one of the following ways:&lt;ref  name=usopm&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.opm.gov/EXTRA/INVESTIGATE/is-01.PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030406210657/http://www.opm.gov/extra/investigate/IS-01.pdf|title=Citizenship Laws of the World|publisher=Office of Personnel Management, Investigations Service|location=Washington, D.C.|date=March 2001|accessdate=2013-12-14|archivedate=2003-04-06|ref=CITEREFOPM2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*By descent:
** Being born to parents, at least one of whom is a citizen of Ukraine.
** Being born abroad to stateless parents, but legally residing in Ukraine, and having acquired no other nationality at birth.
** Being born in Ukraine to non-Ukrainian parents, but legally residing in Ukraine and having not acquired the nationality of either parent.
** Being born in Ukraine to parents, at least one of whom is a registered refugee under Ukrainian law, and having not acquired the nationality of either parent or only the nationality of the parent holding refugee status.
** Being born in Ukraine to unknown parents.
*By registration:
** Being adopted as a child by citizens of Ukraine.
** Having no other citizenship and at least one parent or grandparent Ukrainian by birth.
** Having no other citizenship, under certain conditions listed in the Statute on Citizenship.
*By naturalization:
** Having resided in Ukraine for at least five years, being able to function in the Ukrainian language, and being knowledgeable of the Ukrainian Constitution. The individual is required to voluntarily renounce any foreign citizenships they may hold.

Birth within the territory of Ukraine does not automatically confer citizenship.

==Loss of citizenship==
From 2005 until mid-2017 87.376 people lost their Ukrainian citizenship.&lt;ref name=Ulc31717/&gt; 67.305 of them  voluntarily renounced it, 19.738 lost it because of international agreements and 333 were involuntary deprived of their citizenship.&lt;ref name=Ulc31717&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://pda.pravda.com.ua/news/id_7150944/For 11 years citizenship was deprived of almost 90 thousand Ukrainians], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (July 31, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntary loss of citizenship===
According to Ukraine's nationality law, Ukrainian citizenship can be voluntarily renounced by Ukrainian citizens who have taken up permanent residence in a foreign country and who have acquired a foreign citizenship or have received confirmation that they will acquire a foreign citizenship upon successful renunciation of their Ukrainian citizenship. Citizenship can only be renounced in the presence of a Ukrainian consular official at a [[List of diplomatic missions of Ukraine|Ukrainian diplomatic mission]] and proof of the final/impending acquisition of foreign citizenship is required to do so.

===Automatic loss of citizenship===
Automatic loss of Ukrainian citizenship occurs in the event an adult Ukrainian citizen voluntarily acquires a foreign nationality or enters into the military or governmental service of a foreign power.

Ukrainian citizenship is not automatically lost in the following circumstances:

*Acquiring a foreign citizenship at birth by descent from a parent when Ukrainian citizenship is also acquired by descent.
*Being adopted by foreign nationals when Ukrainian citizenship was originally acquired by descent from a biological parent.
*Automatically acquiring citizenship of one's spouse upon marriage to a foreign national.
*Automatically acquiring a foreign citizenship upon reaching the age of majority in accordance with the nationality law of a foreign country. In this case Ukrainian citizenship is retained providing that the individual had no formal (documented) knowledge of the automatic acquisition of the foreign citizenship.

The decision on  termination of Ukrainian citizenship must be taken by the [[President of Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;Law on Citizenship. Article 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual citizenship==
Ukrainian law currently does not recognise [[dual citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rada.gov.ua/const/conengl.htm Constitution of Ukraine: Article 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521190059/http://www.rada.gov.ua/const/conengl.htm |date=2011-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are citizens of Ukraine who hold dual citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/4b1aa47e76eef/ З життя українських олігархів – вілла Коломойського на Женевському озері], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (March 10, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ukremb"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ria.ru/incidents/20110907/431989797.html|script-title=ru:Посольство Украины подтвердило гибель трех украинцев в крушении Як-42|date=7 September 2011|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|accessdate=|location=Moscow|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainian law states that (after gaining Ukrainian citizenship) the new Ukrainian citizen must renounce its non-Ukrainian citizenship(s) within two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.mobi/a/georgia-saakashvili-citzenship-stripped/27406996.html Saakashvili Slams Georgian Decision To Revoke His Citizenship], [[Radio Free Europe]] (4 December 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 estimate put the number of Ukrainians with more than one passport from 300,000 to a few million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/45040/ Dual Identities], [[Kyiv Post]] (July 9, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Within Ukrainian boundaries Ukrainian citizens who also hold multiple citizenships are considered to be solely Ukrainian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.ua/mfa/en/publication/content/719.htm The Law of Ukraine On Citizenship of Ukraine: Article 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204201403/http://www.mfa.gov.ua/mfa/en/publication/content/719.htm |date=2008-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|''If a citizen of Ukraine acquires citizenship (nationality) of another state or states, in legal relations with Ukraine, the person is recognized as a citizen of Ukraine only. If a foreigner acquires the citizenship of Ukraine, then in legal relations with Ukraine, the person is recognized as a citizen of Ukraine only...''|
20px|20px|''Article 2. Law on citizenship of Ukraine.''}}

On February 8, 2014, the Verkhovna Rada proposed a bill to criminalize the act of holding two citizenships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.liga.net/news/politics/976681-v_radu_vnesen_zakonoproekt_nakazyvayushchiy_za_dvoynoe_grazhdanstvo.htm|title=В Раду внесен законопроект, наказывающий за двойное гражданство|author=|date=|website=liga.net|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visa requirements==
{{main|Visa requirements for Ukrainian citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for Ukrainian citizens.png|thumbnail|400px|right|Visa requirements for Ukrainian citizens]]

In June 2017, Ukrainian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 116 countries and territories, ranking the Ukrainian passport 42nd in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index.

The '''Victorian Reports''' ('''VR''') are a series of [[law report]]s which report significant [[Case law|cases]] from the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]] in its [[Original jurisdiction|first decisions]] and [[Appellate jurisdiction|appeal decisions]] [[jurisdiction]]s.

The reports were initially titled the '''Victorian Law Reports''' ('''VLR''') (1875 to 1956), before adopting their present title in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.monash.edu.au/legal-abbreviations/abb-v.html|title=Monash University Library – Abbreviations of legal publications – VLR|publisher=[[Monash University]]|accessdate=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier equivalent reports, published between 1847 and 1851, had been known as "Williams practice cases" and "A'Beckett's reserved judgments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/content.php?pid=50118&amp;sid=368102|title=Law reports – Court cases in Australia – Research Guides at State Library of Victoria|publisher=[[State Library of Victoria]]|accessdate=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Little William Bourke commenced publishing the Victorian Reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://victorianreports.com.au|title=Victorian Reports Portal|publisher=Little William Bourke |accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new portal contains both the VRs and the VLRs (1875 to date) in a searchable format.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1300">The '''West African Court of Appeal''' ('''WACA''') was a court which served as the appellate court for the British colonies of [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], [[Colonial Nigeria|Nigeria]], [[Gambia Colony and Protectorate|Gambia]], and [[Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate|Sierra Leone]].

The WACA was first established in 1867 as the appellate court for British possessions in western Africa. It was abolished in 1874, but was revived in 1928. Jurisdiction over Nigeria ended in 1954. The court became defunct with the independence of the states which it served. The court was based in Sierra Leone.

Decisions of the court could be appealed with leave to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]].

Australia's first whistleblower protection laws were introduced in [[Queensland]] following the recommendations of the [[Fitzgerald Inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dadic |first=Zac |title=Whistleblower Protection and Disclosures to Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly |year=2009 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=97-113 |url=http://www.aspg.org.au/journal/2009spring_24_2/11-Dadic%20whistleblowings%20ANZACATT.pdf |publisher=Australasian Parliamentary Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws have subsequently been introduced in other states and territories, culminating with the adoption of federal legislation with the passage of the ''Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013''.

==Federal law== 

===General provisions===
The ''Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013'' (PID Act) introduced a new comprehensive framework for protecting Commonwealth public sector whistleblowers.&lt;ref name="pidabd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/billsdgs/2494869/upload_binary/2494869.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22legislation/billsdgs/2494869%22 |title=Bills Digest No. 125, 2012–13: Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013 |accessdate=20 April 2016 |publisher=Australian Parliamentary Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PID Act is the legislation underpinning the Commonwealth Government's Public Interest Disclosure (PID) Scheme to encourage public officials to report suspected wrongdoing in the Australian public sector. The PID Act arose in response to the report on Whistleblower Protection: a comprehensive scheme for the Commonwealth public sector by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.&lt;ref&gt; House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Whistleblower Protection: a comprehensive scheme for the Commonwealth public sector, 2009 http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=laca/whistleblowing/report.htm &lt;/ref&gt; During the Committee's Inquiry it was recognised that whistleblowers play an important role in ensuring accountability. As a result, those making disclosures needed to be protected from retribution. 

The PID Act offers protection to 'whistleblowers' from reprisal action. The protection applies to public officials who disclose suspected illegal conduct, corruption, maladministration, abuses of public trust, deception relating to scientific research, wastage of public money, unreasonable danger to health or safety, danger to the environment or abuse of position or conduct which may be grounds for disciplinary action.

The Commonwealth Ombudsman has a significant role supporting and monitoring the administration of the whistleblower scheme established under the PID Act. The Commonwealth Ombudsman is responsible for promoting awareness and understanding of the PID Act as well as providing guidance, information and resources about making, managing and responding to disclosures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ombudsman.gov.au/about/making-a-disclosure&lt;/ref&gt;

The unauthorised disclosure of Commonwealth information is a federal crime under section 70 of the ''Crimes Act 1914'' that carries a penalty of two years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca191482|Crimes Act 1914|70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provision is often used to pursue whistleblowers and leaks by federal government employees and private contractors.&lt;ref name=s70ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Journalists reporting on asylum seekers referred to Australian police |author=Paul Farrell |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jan/22/journalists-reporting-on-asylum-seekers-referred-to-australian-police |date=22 January 2015 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Abbott Government]] took office, federal agencies have referred journalists from ''[[The Guardian]] Australia'', [[news.com.au]] and ''[[The West Australian]]'' using this provision in a bid to uncover the sources for immigration stories.&lt;ref name="s70ref" /&gt;

===National security===
The ''National Security Amendment Act (No 1) 2014 (Cth)'' amended the legislation governing [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation|ASIO]] to criminalise the disclosure of any information relating to a "Special Intelligence Operation".&lt;ref name="natsecbd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/billsdgs/3361366/upload_binary/3361366.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22legislation/billsdgs/3361366%22 |title=Bills Digest No. 19, 2014-15: National Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014 |date=3 June 2013 |accessdate=20 April 2016 |publisher=Australian Parliamentary Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' noted that any act committed by ASIO could be declaration a Special Intelligence Operation with the Attorney-General's approval and removed from scrutiny.&lt;ref name=farrelnatsec /&gt;

===Immigration law===
Section 42 of the ''Australian Border Force Act 2015'' (Cth) imposes a penalty of two years' imprisonment for a whistleblower who makes a disclosure in relation to an [[Australian immigration detention facilities|Australian immigration detention facility]], although section 42(2)(c) exempts a disclosure where it is "required or authorised by or under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|abfa2015225|Australian Border Force Act 2015|42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] considered whether the section 42(2)(c) exemption would apply so that a whistleblower could rely on the protections of ''Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013'' (Cth).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/factcheck-could-a-whistleblower-go-public-without-fear-of-prosecution-under-the-border-force-act-44467|title=FactCheck: Could a whistleblower go public without fear of prosecution under the Border Force Act?|last=Hoang|first=Khanh|website=The Conversation|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It found that the exemption might indeed apply, but would do so subject to several qualifications, such as:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* the whistleblower would first need to report their concerns internally
* an external disclosure could only then be made after the whistleblower believed on reasonable grounds that the either the investigation or response were inadequate or delayed
* the disclosure must not be contrary to the public interest nor make public sensitive information about law enforcement
* the disclosure cannot be made about a matter in which a Minister has taken action or proposes to take action.
Section 42 of the ''Australian Border Force Act 2015'' (Cth) has been criticised by the Australian Lawyers Alliance for its potential [[chilling effect]] on whistleblowers and journalists.&lt;ref name="chilling" /&gt;

Medical professionals who have worked at [[Nauru]] are launching a [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] challenge against the secrecy provisions of the ''Australian Border Force Act 2015''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What are the secrecy provisions of the Border Force Act?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-27/what-are-the-secrecy-provisions-of-the-border-force-act/7663608|accessdate=27 July 2016|work=ABC News|date=27 July 2016|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private sector===
[[Transparency International]] Australia considers the protections for private sector whistleblowers to be weaker than for those in the public sector, with the main provisions found in corporations legislation that does not mandate any internal company procedures.&lt;ref name=tia /&gt;

Part 9.4AAA of the Corporations Act provides a degree of protection.&lt;ref name="km"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kordamentha.com/docs/default-source/for-publications/issue-14-05-protection-for-whistleblowers-in-australia.pdf2 |title=  Blowing the whistle: Protection for whistleblowers in Australia |date=September 2014 |page=4 |accessdate=20 April 2016 |publisher=KordaMentha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State and territory laws==
Apart from South Australia, the [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] whistleblower protection laws only cover the public sector.&lt;ref name=cpaa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpaaustralia.com.au/~/media/corporate/allfiles/document/professional-resources/ethics/whistleblowing.pdf |title=Whistleblowing: Some Relevant Considerations |publisher=CPA Australia |page=9 |accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
