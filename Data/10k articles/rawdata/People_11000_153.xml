'''Agents''' are a group of characters in [[The Matrix (franchise)|''The Matrix'' franchise]]. They are [[sentient]] computer programs carefully disguised as average-looking human males,&lt;ref name="rogerebert"/&gt; displaying a high-level of [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sparknotes.com/film/matrix/canalysis.html "The Matrix Trilogy"]. [[SparkNotes]]. Retrieved 3 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agents are representatives within the Matrix [[fictional universe]].&lt;ref name="rogerebert"/&gt; They are guardians within the computer-generated world of the [[Matrix (fictional universe)|Matrix]], protecting it from anyone or anything (most often [[Red pill and blue pill|Redpill]]s) that could reveal it as a false reality or threaten it in any other way.&lt;ref name="rogerebert"/&gt;

Agents also hunt down and terminate any rogue programs, such as [[Keymaker|The Keymaker]], which no longer serve a purpose to the overall Machine objective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-matrix "The Matrix"]. [[Common Sense Media]]. Retrieved 3 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; They physically appear human, but have a tendency to speak and act in highly precise and mechanical ways.&lt;ref name="rogerebert"/&gt;

==Physical aspects==
Agents wear black [[Suit (clothes)|business suits]] lined with a gold fabric, white [[dress shirt]]s, black [[dress shoes]], black neckties with a silver [[Tie clip|bar clip]], square [[sunglasses]], and a communication [[Headphones|earpiece]]. These features are copied from the attire for plainclothes agents of the [[United States Secret Service]], as well as those of the [[Men in Black]] conspiracy or the stereotypical [[G-Man (slang)|G-Man]]/[[FBI portrayal in the media|FBI]] official. All Agents are [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] males (with a minor exceptions of black Agent Perry and female Agent Pace from ''[[The Matrix Online]]'' game), which also provides a dynamic compared to the majority population of Zion, containing many diverse cultures and walks of life. With the exception of Agent Pace, Agents also tend to have common Anglo-Saxon names such as Smith, Jones, Brown, etc. They have sideburns, and their hair is either slicked back or side-parted. Matrix Agents carry [[Desert Eagle]] handguns in shoulder holsters that are concealed beneath their suit jackets. In addition to proficiency in the use of firearms, all Agents are masters of the [[martial arts]] and hand-to-hand combat. 

Agents are programmed with a number of [[superhuman]] abilities. An Agent's speed, agility, stamina and reflexes enable them to leap great distances such as across building rooftops, sway their body from side to side to evade gunfire, and perform unusual counter attacks in melee combat (Agent Smith managed to directly counter a punch from Morpheus with a punch of his own to Morpheus's still-moving fist). Agents possess [[superhuman strength]], performing feats such as tearing open a car's roof with one hand and punching through solid [[concrete]]. Although they can be momentarily stunned by certain attacks (such as when Neo jabbed his fingers into Agent Smith's throat), they are generally impervious to pain and injury (the upgraded Agent that Trinity shot in the abdomen and shoulder showed no reaction of pain).

In spite of their abilities, they can be caught off guard with a point-blank [[contact shot]] aimed directly at their head or a barrage of firepower from a weapon with a high rate of fire, such as that from a “[[minigun]]”. Any trauma that is instantly lethal to a vital organ will kill an Agent.

However, being "killed" is a temporary inconvenience, as Agents do not exist in their own bodies as other programs do. Rather, they [[spirit possession|take over]] the virtualized body of a [[Bluepill]]—a human directly connected to the Matrix—which transforms into the Agent's form until the Agent leaves the body. An Agent can jump from one body to another, either to re-emerge in the Matrix if they "die" (which only kills the host body) or to hunt their quarry by taking over a nearby Bluepill. For this reason, areas with a high population density (crowded apartment buildings, market places, freeways, etc.) are usually avoided by the Zion rebels, who regard every Bluepill as potential threat that could become an Agent at any time. Matrix Agents can also disguise themselves as the host body (when Agent Smith possessed the body of a Matrix SWAT soldier and used it as a disguise to locate Morpheus and his crew hiding in the walls of the bathroom). 

Beyond their conventional abilities, Agents possess some level of influence over the Matrix to rewrite aspects of itself. In the first film, Agent Smith was able to plant a suggestion that Neo's mouth has sealed shut which made his mouth disappear on his [[residual_self_image#Residual_self-image|residual self-image]] (RSI), and later, the Agents changed the Matrix to trap the rebels inside a hotel by surrounding it with brick walls. It is not explained how this ability works but is most likely based on a line of communication to the Source, rather than an Agent possessing inherent access to manipulate the Matrix's source code.

In addition to their abilities, Agents possess an unspecified level of authority to command civilian law enforcement as both security and first-line enforcers: in particular, they have a heavily-armed SWAT team that serves as their building security. The Agents have branded the Zion infiltrators as terrorists, and the unassuming law enforcement officers will arrest or kill any rebels on the word of the Agents.

With the exception of Smith, who seems intellectually superior to his colleagues (and far more ambitious), Agents show little or no emotion.

==Interaction with Zion infiltrators and other programs==
In any direct confrontation, an Agent's abilities ensure they would prevail against a normal human opponent that would eventually exhaust their own firepower, stamina, and capacity to sustain pain and injury. All Zion hovercraft crew members know that Agents are extremely dangerous and virtually impossible to eliminate; as such, they are cautioned to escape upon encountering one. According to [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]], in the time before [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] was freed from the Matrix, every human that had stood their ground against an Agent was killed. Morpheus and Neo both individually fought Agent Smith in the first movie, and both were defeated, only surviving because Smith needed Morpheus for questioning and Neo due to his self-realization of himself as the One. Later, once Neo had harnessed his abilities as the One, Agents no longer posed a threat to him and he could easily disintegrate Smith, scaring Agents Brown and Jones into fleeing. It is implied in the game ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'' that one of the main reasons for Neo's ability to defeat Agents was his ability to focus enough to move quickly for far longer periods than could normal rebels. This is the main cause of the player's difficulty in fighting Agents, since when the player is outside bullet time the Agents are able to dodge and counter all hand-to-hand attacks.

Morpheus had been fortunate enough to survive encounters with two Agents (Smith and Johnson) throughout the trilogy. He was defeated soundly by Smith (who beat him to a bloody pulp but left him alive because he needed information from the high-ranking infiltrator), and only overcame Johnson due to the nature of their situation; he did not wear down his opponent, but merely threw him from the top of the speeding truck on which they were fighting, although he only managed to turn the tables on his foe after he was thrown off, due to the unexpected arrival of [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]], who rescued him.

Niobe has defeated an Agent, but as with Morpheus, there were extenuating circumstances. The fight took place on board a cargo plane in the skies above the Megacity; Niobe lowered the rear cargo ramp and managed to knock Agent Johnson out of the plane.

[[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Ghost|Ghost]] has also defeated a single Agent during a raid on a nuclear power plant, again by making use of unique circumstances of the encounter. Agent Johnson challenged him in the control room of the plant, whereupon he damaged one of the high-voltage [[Server (computing)|servers]] with small arms fire and threw his opponent into it, electrocuting him.

The Oracle's bodyguard [[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]] says to Smith in ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'': "I have beaten you before," but this is not expanded upon. Smith remarks that chasing Seraph is like "chasing a ghost," suggesting a lasting rivalry between the two programs.   

[[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] is the only other character to have "stood up" against an Agent and survive, given that she dispatched Agent Jones by a [[contact shot]] when he was near to killing Neo, getting in close while the Agent's attention was focused on Neo. If, as Morpheus suggests, no other human had survived an Agent encounter, this would mark the first time that an Agent had been "defeated", albeit the Agent's program then "body hopped" into another Bluepill and was fighting again within minutes.

==Notable film agents==
===Agents Jones and Brown===
In the first film, Agents Jones ([[Robert Taylor (Australian actor)|Robert Taylor]]) and Brown ([[Paul Goddard (actor)|Paul Goddard]]) are credited as Agent Smith's "sidekicks". Smith is given at least one order (or at least a forceful suggestion) by Jones ("order the strike"), and there appears to be some resentment or disagreement between the three on several occasions.

Jones and Brown undergo little character development and do not appear in the sequels, though they are occasionally seen in ''[[The Matrix Online]]''. They are mostly silent, but brutal accomplices to Smith, who perform secondary tasks such as holding Neo in place when Smith places a tracking device (possibly a program) inside his body cavity.

Brown chases Trinity across the rooftops in the opening sequence, missing several shots. Brown is also present in the scene wherein Morpheus is interrogated, injecting a truth serum into Morpheus's neck. Finally, Brown is ordered by Smith to check Neo for life signs after Smith shoots him and confirms Neo's death. Brown shows subtle hints of cynically deriding his "superior" Smith, such as when he seems slightly annoyed at him when they are interrogating Morpheus.

Jones is less prominent than Brown in the first movie, but his most notable scene is a confrontation with Neo in a rooftop fight. He then stands above the stricken Neo, uttering the line "[o]nly human," before being shot by Trinity, who managed to get in close enough to shoot him in the head at [[point-blank range]] while he was occupied with Neo. From this, it can be deduced Jones perceives the human race much as Smith does, though with less unbridled revulsion. Likely as a precaution, Jones is briefly seen in the background holding Brown back when Neo is about to destroy Smith in the end of the film, and they are last seen fleeing from Neo. Jones seems slightly more jaded and bored with his tasks than the other Agents.

===Upgraded Agents===
''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' introduced "Upgraded" Agents, Jackson, Johnson, and Thompson. Their enhanced strength, speed and stamina enable them to engage in protracted combat with Neo. In ''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]'', the upgraded Agents recover from violent physical injuries in a relatively short time. However, an unarmed Neo is still able to defeat them easily. 

The upgraded Agents continue the use of very plain, common, [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] names. A difference is that now their names are all two syllables and end in "-son", while the original Agents had names consisting of only a short syllable. Agent Johnson appears to be the leader of the upgrades, filling the same role as Smith prior to his first "death". Johnson attempts to destroy the exiled Keymaker program, and fights Morpheus on top of a speeding truck.

=== Rogue Agents ===
{{main|Agent Smith}}
When Smith was destroyed by Neo at the end of ''[[The Matrix]]'', his programming instructed him to return to the Source (the Machine mainframe), either to be destroyed or stored. As a result of Neo's attack, something changed in Smith that allowed him to defy his programming. The change in Smith also disconnects him from the system, setting him "free" from his duties. In effect, this change makes Smith an "Exile" program without purpose. By copying his programming onto others, especially The Oracle, Smith develops similar qualities as the One, such as the ability to withstand dramatic damage and the power of flight. Because Smith feels that he is still a victim to "purpose", he thus makes it his goal to destroy both Zion and The Matrix. Beginning to behave like a [[computer virus|virus]], he makes multitudinous copies of himself by using humans and other programs in the Matrix as hosts. The copies thereafter display the memories and special abilities of any assimilated programs, such as the Oracle's ability to see the future and control over The Matrix. Smith's ability to copy himself onto others may be a corruption of his original ability to move between hosts before Neo's attack. Neo is shown to be the only person able to withstand such assimilations, Morpheus only being spared because Neo threw off the Smiths that were trying to copy over him; even the Oracle fell victim to the attack, although it apparently required greater effort on Smith's part than usual. Smith eventually assimilates the entire Matrix and is destroyed when Neo, co-operating with the Machines, allows himself to be overwritten by Smith after a protracted fight.

Smith's appearance changes slightly once he loses his status as an Agent. His sunglasses take on an angular shape that is an approximation of the rounded lenses Neo uses. In addition, he removes his earpiece and sends it to Neo as a warning.

{{main|The Twins (The Matrix)}}
The Twins are believed to be Agents of the second Matrix prototype: the 'Hell' Matrix. When the new Matrix versions were created, along with new versions of the Agents, the Twins were seen as worthless and were sentenced to deletion. However, they avoided deletion and become exiles/rogue programs, working for The Merovingian as bodyguards.

===Other Agents===
Many other agents have appeared in the ''Animatrix'', the Matrix console games, and the Matrix comics. Agents Ash, Bird, Finn, Fine, Gray, and White are the only Agents named there, but other unnamed Agents have appeared as well.

Agent White also appears in ''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]'' as a replacement for [[Agent Smith|Smith]] after the latter was destroyed by [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]. White appears in only one section of the Redpill Rescue level called The Security Guard. He appears much like Agent Brown but has his own personality, and appears to be stronger than both Jones and Brown at the time as he gives Neo a fair degree of difficulty, even while Neo is the One.

The ''[[The Animatrix|Animatrix]]'' story ''[[World Record (The Animatrix)|World Record]]'' featured a different style of Agent wearing full-length trenchcoats instead of the usual dark suit.

==Notable MMO agents==
The Agents lived on in the film's continuation, the MMORPG ''[[The Matrix Online]]''. In line with the brokered truce created by Neo at the end of ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', Agents were no longer assigned to kill [[redpill]]s on sight. Instead, they guard various areas of the Matrix that are still restricted to the awakened. The Agents revert to their original programming with the collapse of the Truce.

===Impostor Agents===
Red-Eyed "Impostor" Agents appeared at the start of ''The Matrix Online'' storyline during chapter 1.1. These "agents" impersonated system representatives and began widespread sabotage and assaults on the awakened redpills in an attempt to stress/break the truce agreement. All three major organizations ([[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]], the Machines, and [[the Merovingian]]) were quick to deny being responsible for the attacks and the impostors were soon declared a fourth group unto themselves.

It was soon discovered that these beings were not agents at all, but rather were using some kind of disguise technology to try to implicate the machines for their actions. Glowing red eyes and lack of system-issue firearms were flaws in the plan.

It is revealed in a "Report to the General" document that the Red-Eyed Agents are the General's, the Exile who used to command the Sentinels, commandos, taking into consideration that programs could gain access to other shells (like the way the Oracle changed appearance in the movies), made occasional documented reports to the General in various Zion and Machine critical missions, and also hinted that their disguises were malfunctioning.

=== {{Visible anchor|Agent Gray}} ===
Gray was one of several Agents trapped in the Matrix during the infestation known as Smith. His program was overwritten with new code, executing instructions which conflicted with his primary architecture. When Smith was defeated and Smith's program was withdrawn from the system, Gray was freed.

The Machine Civilization is run by cautious protocols, and there was still some chance that the Smith code had found a place to shelter within the system, or within an RSI. Agents that had been exposed to Smith were quarantined within the Matrix during the reset – something that is usually never done. Bluepills have their connections to the system attenuated so they never notice the event, and Exiles can seek shelter in a construct, but Agents have no such recourse. Those trapped in the system during the reset were literally turned inside out as their code was deconstructed and recompiled with a vicious error-checking routine.

Even afterward, he has not been allowed to return to the Source, instead relegated to a buffer system created during the reboot – a gateway construct which acts as a Machine analog to the Merovingian's Mobil Avenue Station. In some ways he is almost an Exile, but for the fact that he believes he will eventually be able to return to the Source.

Due to his current situation, Agent Gray was selected to act as recruiter and Controller for human beings that the Machines believe can assist them in controlling the Matrix. Like all Agents he is normally dispassionate and aloof, with a precise manner of speaking, but his forced dealings with humans have left him with somewhat more understanding of them than most Agents.

When dealing with humans, he uses many euphemisms, as he has found that humans often prefer not to say what they really mean. Death is "cessation of awareness"; stealing is "expeditious acquisition". He addresses humans by their gender titles and bluepill last name (e.g. "Mister Anderson"), and seems to have a foolproof way of knowing this information about every human to whom he speaks.

Though Gray resented his assignment greatly at first, he has come to appreciate that he is better at dealing with humans than most other machine Agents. Although he does not enjoy interacting with humans, his efficiency at it gives him a sense of pride.

Occasionally, a remnant of Smith's code has been known to influence his behavior, causing him to develop a misanthropic and homicidal attitude, as well as greatly increasing his power.

Agent Gray is voiced by [[John Patrick Lowrie]].

===Agent Pace===
Agent Pace is the first female Agent, created in ''The Matrix Online'' storyline as an attempt by the Machines to better interact with their human liaisons.  Agent Pace is somewhat less stern and more personable than other Agents, and often refers to her human liaisons using [[Italian language|Italian]] terms, almost verging on "pet names" if AI could be said to use them (similar to how the Merovingian program decided that he prefers French over other human languages, Pace likes Italian). "Pace" also means "peace" in Italian.

==Musical career==

===Star Factory===
Prikhodko won the seventh edition of the Russian television singing [[Talent show|talent contest]] [[Star Factory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://visualrian.com/images/item/174378 {{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.musicsrc.com/video/Anastasia+Prihodko+-+Russian+Star+Factory-7+-+Nevesomo.php?id=7uiV6VKZfWo  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307164600/http://musicsrc.com/video/anastasia%20prihodko%20-%20russian%20star%20factory-7%20-%20nevesomo.php?id=7uiv6vkzfwo |date=March 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the show, Prikhodko was filmed telling another contestant that she did not like [[Chinese people]] and [[Black people|blacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8AbPQW0qG8 Fragment of "Star Factory"], Youtube (March 12, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; She apologized about this shortly after the incident.

===Eurovision Song Contest 2009===

====Ukrainian national selection====
Prikhodko entered the [[Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009|Ukrainian national selection for the 2009 Eurovision]] in the semi-final. She was disqualified for performing her own composition, "Vsë za tebya" ("Все за тебя"), from her repertoire for the ''Star Factory'' TV show. The National Jury saw it as a violation of Paragraph 4.3 of the Rules of Eurovision Song Competition issued by the [[National Television Company of Ukraine]] on October 31, 2008 prohibiting performance in the semi-final of anything but the Eurovision entry. In explicit words, the paragraph said: "On 8 February 2009 on the improvised stage set in the NTVU studios, the 30 semi-finalists perform their competition songs live."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1tv.com.ua/euro/euro2009/eurodoc/ Положення про Національний відбір "Євробачення-2009"] Перший канал {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422010500/http://www.1tv.com.ua/euro/euro2009/eurodoc/ |date=April 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prikhodko's interpretation of the rules was that as her Eurovision entry song "[[Mamo (song)|Mamo]]" had been submitted already in the first round of the competition, the rules did not require her to perform the song before the final. In Prikhodko's understanding, the semi final had been just a showcase of the contestant's vocal talents.&lt;ref name="kaz"/&gt; She and her manager Olena Mozhova (ex-wife of [[Oleksandr Ponomaryov]], one of the members of the jury) claimed that neither the broadcaster [[National Television Company of Ukraine|NTU]] nor the members of the jury had used trustworthy methods to select the contestants. The duo sent a letter to the [[President of Ukraine]] where Prikhodko stated: "as a citizen of Ukraine, native Kievan, patriot of the country, I was deeply staggered by the impertinent actions and unethical comments of representatives of NTU, and also members of the so-called 'objective, impartial and independent' judges of the competition... I only ask for an honest chance to come forward before an All-Ukrainian audience in the finale of the National selection". The letter was co-signed by Konstantin Meladze and fellow Ukrainian artists [[Sofia Rotaru]], [[Mykola Mozhovyy]] and [[Tina Karol]].&lt;ref name=patriot&gt;{{uk icon}}[http://ua.korrespondent.net/showbiz/756503 Співачка, яка не потрапила у фінал відбору на Євробачення, написала листа Ющенку], [[Korrespondent]] (February 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The Ukrainian national final, held on March 8, 2009, was temporarily suspended by a [[court]] based in Kiev due to Prikhodko's protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/13451|title=Ukraine: National final to take place tomorrow|last=Hondal|first=Victor|date=2009-03-07|work=ESCToday|accessdate=2009-03-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090310110624/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/13451| archivedate= March 10, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5284|title=Ukraine: National Final to go on as planned|last=Calleja Bayliss|first=Marc|date=2009-03-07|work=Oikotimes|accessdate=2009-03-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312023916/http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5284|archivedate=March 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prikhodko claims, the court ruled in favour of her.

Prikhodko sang her entry in both Russian and Ukrainian. "I'm convinced, when representing one's country, one should sing in the native language," she said:"Russian preselection committee has agreed to my principal condition – to perform "Mamo" in the final of Russian preselection in both [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Russian language]]s".&lt;ref name=kaz/&gt; After the final, Iosif Prigozhin the producer of the losing finalist [[Valeriya]] stated: "A song performed in Ukrainian can’t have anything to do with Russia". Valeriya herself sang in English. Prikhodko's win of the Russian national selection for the 2009 Eurovision sparked allegations of vote-rigging.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article5875152.ece Eurovision vote-rigging row as Ukrainian wins contest to represent Russia], [[The Times]] (March 10, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eurovision Song Contest final performance====
[[Image:Anastasiya Prykhodko.jpg|thumb|right|Prikhodko at the Final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2009]]
Prikhodko became the second non-Russian singer (the first being [[Natalia Podolskaya]]) to [[Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest|represent Russia at the Eurovision Song Contest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tophitru.com/newsshowdetale.shtml?id=872 ''To Natalia Podolskaya it almost wasn`t forbidden to start up to Moscow all because of her Belarus passport''], tophit.ru (Februarie 12, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Against the usual Eurovision canons, the final performance did not include choreography but concentrated on Prikhodko's vocal skills and emotions. The giant floating screens at the background featured a video of her face aging from a twenty-year-old to a seventy-year-old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=2490 Russia: Drama in black], ESCToday&lt;/ref&gt; She finished in 11th place with 91 points.

===Later career===
Producer Konstantin Meladze ended his collaboration with Prikhodko in 2010 and her new partnership with producer Igor Goncharenko ended in May of the same year.&lt;ref name=May2010&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://afisha.mail.ru/article.html?id=27921 Продюсеры отказываются работать с Настей Приходько] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507162313/http://afisha.mail.ru/article.html?id=27921 |date=May 7, 2010 }}, [[Mail.ru]] (May 4, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Since then her brother Nazar has been her writing partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://afisha.mail.ru/article.html?id=28410 Анастасия Приходько снова одна] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625164041/http://afisha.mail.ru/article.html?id=28410 |date=June 25, 2010 }}, [[Mail.ru]] (June 22, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Prikhodko switched to a [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] repertoire in 2015.&lt;ref name="5a9d48f0a9f2c Prikhodko"&gt;{{uk icon}} [https://tabloid.pravda.com.ua/person/5a9d48f0a9f2c/ Prikhodko: I do not know how to cheer people], [[Табло ID]] (5 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed that this cost her popularity because at the time Ukrainian chart succes was achieved with "funny, cheerful, with inflammatory music or [[Russian language|Russian]]."&lt;ref name="5a9d48f0a9f2c Prikhodko"/&gt;

In 2016, Prikhodko attempted to qualify for the [[Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016 Eurovision Song Contest]]. She failed to qualify from the semi-final, finished seventh out of nine contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Omelyanchuk|first1=Olena|title=Ukraine: Results of the first semi-final|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=ukraine_results_of_the_first_semi-final|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=6 February 2016|date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 October 2018 Prikhodko anounced on [[Facebook]] that she had decided to end her musical career.&lt;ref name="Prikhodko161018"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.obozrevatel.com/ukr/show/people/ya-jdu-zi-stseni-prihodko-zrobila-guchnu-zayavu.htm |script-title=uk:  ''Я йду зі сцени'': Приходько зробила гучну заяву |language= Ukrainian |trans-title="I'm leaving the scene": Prikhodko made a loud statement |publisher= [[Obozrevatel]] |date= 16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistry===
Prikhodko has an unusually deep [[contralto]] vocal range. Combining this with her folk vocal training, her repertoire comprises atypical songs in a [[minor key]] with a touch of folk style, performed in Ukrainian and Russian. Prikhodko composes some of her songs herself. She plays the [[flute]], the guitar and the [[pianoforte]], with the latter as her favourite instrument. Prikhodko pays great attention to criticism, and always tries to improve herself accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rian.ru/ev09_bio/20090307/164160258.html Анастасия Приходько.

During their early childhood Clyde and Kerry were cared for by a nurse, Inez McCracken, whom Clyde described as a "surrogate mother" who made "an unbearable childhood tolerable".&lt;ref name="Connolly"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.news.com.au/opinion/indigo-is-the-luckiest-packer-of-them-all/story-e6frfs99-1111117043148 | title = Indigo Is the Luckiest Packer of Them All | last = Connolly | first = Fiona | work = [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Telegraph]] | publisher = [[News Corp Australia]] | date = 29 July 2008 | accessdate = 17 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Packer was a boarder at [[Cranbrook School, Sydney|Cranbrook School]] in Sydney and then [[Geelong Grammar School|Geelong Grammar]] in Victoria.&lt;ref name="Milliken"/&gt; He took part in various sports at school, including boxing, cricket, and rugby.&lt;ref name="Milliken"/&gt;

== Media career==
In the early 1950s, instead of attending university as he wished, Clyde Packer heeded his father's directive "You go to work for me ... You'll learn far more in the school of hard knocks".&lt;ref name="Milliken"/&gt; He joined Australian Consolidated Press (ACP) as a journalist and sub-editor of its flagship, ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref name="Milliken"/&gt; For six&amp;nbsp;months he worked at the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in London.&lt;ref name="Milliken"/&gt; In 1954 ACP launched a magazine, ''Weekend'', with [[Donald Horne]] as editor and Packer on staff.&lt;ref name="Packer Media"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ketupa.net/packer2.htm | title = Packer: Landmarks | publisher = Ketupa.net | accessdate = 15 October 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130403065954/http://ketupa.net/packer2.htm | archivedate = 3 April 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Horne"&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=v157FNdS-OcC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=clyde+packer+peter+coleman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d4hoRm6Z_X&amp;sig=ndUGXgLHfrk7QMDdIfuVw3cG7AQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pDVcUpj1IcSfiQfzjoCICA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=clyde%20packer&amp;f=false | title = On How I Came to Write The Lucky Country | last = Horne | first = Donald | authorlink = Donald Horne | publisher = [[University of Melbourne|Melbourne University Press]] (MUP) | location = Melbourne | year = 2006 | pages = 12–18, 23, 75–76, 81 | accessdate = 15 October 2013 | isbn = 978-0-52285-222-6 | series = Issue 4 of MUP Masterworks }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1956 Packer was a director at ACP, Frank purchased the rights to Sydney TV station [[TCN|TCN-9]] – the first Australian station to begin regular broadcasting.&lt;ref name="Packer Media"/&gt; By 1957 ''Weekend'' employed [[Lillian Roxon]] as a journalist and later a sub-editor.&lt;ref name="Milliken 2"/&gt; When Queensland authorities wanted to ban the magazine Packer and Horne successfully fought the injunction in court.&lt;ref name="Milliken 2"/&gt;

ACP followed, in February 1958, with the launch of ''The Observer'', an "intellectual magazine" where Horne was editor and Packer was his boss.&lt;ref name="Packer Media"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horne"/&gt; Packer allowed Horne to hire various contributors including [[Bruce Beresford]], [[Peter Coleman]], [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], [[Barry Humphries]], and [[James McAuley]].&lt;ref name="Milliken"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horne"/&gt; Packer was later the talent manager for Humphries.&lt;ref name="Lawson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yarrow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PowerHouse"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://from.ph/417219 | title = 97/272/1-2/14 Photographic print, black and white, 'Taking a leak', Clyde Packer and Barry Humphreys at urinals in Luna Park, by Janice Wakely, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, 1976 | last1 = Powerhouse Museum | authorlink1 = Powerhouse Museum | last2 = Wakely | first2 = Janice | accessdate = 15 October 2013 | publisher = Powerhouse Museum, Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 Packer had hired [[Francis James]] of Anglican Press to print ''The Observer'' but after three years and a run of "broken deadlines, overcharges, misprints, [and] slow deliveries" Horne and Packer had taken that job away.&lt;ref name="Horne"/&gt;

In 1960 ACP were involved in a commercial rivalry with [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corp Australia|News Limited]], over interests in print media in Sydney.&lt;ref name="Tiffen"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://inside.org.au/nine-tenths-of-the-law/ | title = Nine-tenths of the Law | last = Tiffen | first = Rodney | authorlink = Rodney Tiffen | publisher = Inside Story | date = 3 June 2010 | accessdate = 14 October 2013 | issn = 1837-0497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ACP had made an offer to buy Anglican Press when it was placed in receivership so that they could publish suburban newspapers in opposition to Murdoch's recent acquisitions.&lt;ref name="Tiffen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horne"/&gt; In June 1960 the rivalry between the two groups turned into a physical brawl where men hired by Murdoch fought with Packer, Kerry and their associates over the control of Anglican Press building.&lt;ref name="Tiffen"/&gt; The Murdoch group had a photographer take evidence of the fracas and their afternoon newspaper, ''[[The Daily Mirror (Australia)|The Daily Mirror]]'', ran a front page article headlined "Knight's Sons in City Brawl" with a photo of Packer ejecting the manager of Anglican Press, John Willis, into the street.&lt;ref name="Tiffen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?ei=5dddUt3yNsP_iAfl7oHIAw&amp;id=IePgAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=clyde+packer&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Clyde+Packer%22 | title = The Rise and Rise of Kerry Packer Uncut | last = Barry | first = Paul | authorlink = Paul Barry | publisher = Bantam Books / ABC Books ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]) | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-86325-331-4 | page = 128 | accessdate = 16 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year Frank bought majority interests in Melbourne TV station [[GTV (Australia)|GTV-9]] which was combined with TCN-9 to form Australia's first national network, [[Nine Network]].&lt;ref name="Packer Media"/&gt;

In 1961 Packer was promoted to assistant general manager of ACP.&lt;ref name="MLC Record"/&gt; During that year two ACP publications ''Weekend'' and ''The [[Australian Woman's Mirror]]'' were merged to form ''[[Everybody's (Australian magazine)|Everybody's]]'' with Horne editing and Packer as its manager.&lt;ref name="Horne"/&gt; In 1965 Packer was made general manager of ACP and founded a record label also called Everybody's as a joint venture with [[Harry M.

During the late-1960s Packer took on more of the administration of Network Nine while Spin Records continued to release singles and albums by various Australian artists.&lt;ref name="Milliken"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimball 2"/&gt; In June 1969 Miller produced the Australian stage version of ''[[Hair (musical)#Early international productions|Hair]]'', a rock musical.&lt;ref name="Hair NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.orlok.com/hair/holding/articles/HairArticles/NYT6-7-69.html | title = ''Hair'' Reaches Australia | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 7 June 1969 | page = 26 | publisher = ''Hair'' Online Archives | accessdate = 15 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimball 3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.milesago.com/Stage/hair.htm | title = Stage Shows – ''Hair'': Original Australian Production, 1969–71 | last1 = Kimball | first1 = Duncan | publisher = Milesago: Australasian Music and Popular Culture 1964–1975.

=== Dispute with father ===
In 1970 Clyde Packer became joint managing director of Nine Network with his father, Frank.&lt;ref name="Milliken"/&gt; Clyde later recalled: "[I]t was a very equitable arrangement ... I had the responsibility and he had the authority".&lt;ref name="Milliken"/&gt; Late in the next year Clyde Packer launched ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' on the Nine network, with [[Mike Willesee]] hosting.&lt;ref name="Carmody"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/stories/s275373.htm | title = Clyde Packer dies at 65 | last = Carmody | first = Rebecca | work = The World Today | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date = 10 April 2001 | accessdate = 17 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Willesee organised for ''A Current Affair'' to have an on-air interview with then-union leader, [[Bob Hawke]], during an industrial dispute.&lt;ref name="Carmody"/&gt; When Frank heard of the arrangement he vetoed the decision to allow Hawke on his network, undermining Clyde's authority.&lt;ref name="Carmody"/&gt; Willesee later declared: "You can't run a current affairs program, as you couldn't run a serious newspaper, and have people tell you you can't have the leader of the Trade Union movement".&lt;ref name="Carmody"/&gt; Packer resigned his posts at the Nine Network and ACP, and later reflected on the split: "I suspect my father was as glad to get rid of me as I was to get rid of him".&lt;ref name="Milliken"/&gt;

Their public falling-out followed years of tight control by Frank. According to [[Paul Barry]], "Clyde Packer ... was also frequently dressed down and abused in public by his father, Sir Frank. Into his late thirties, Clyde was still treated like a stupid, disobedient little boy, until he could take no more and rebelled against such tyranny, splitting clearly and completely with his father".&lt;ref name="Donaldson"&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=V-KjZ8p3N2oC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%22clyde+packer%22+dressed+down&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I5OHw0uQB7&amp;sig=JAa4RE0teFCE6Vo9sG1YD5mJcxY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GeJdUs_fDofliAfR5oDwBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22clyde%20packer%22&amp;f=false | last1 = Donaldson | first1 = Mike | last2 = Poynting | first2 = Scott | title = Ruling Class Men: Money, Sex, Power | page = 32 | publisher = Peter Lang | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-3-03911-137-4 | accessdate = 16 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On his father's death in May 1974, the family estate, valued at A$100 million passed directly to Kerry.&lt;ref name=Higham&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ssSijGtEWyAC&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Giants of Tourism |first1=James E.S. |last1 =Highham |first2=Scott |last2 = Cohen|page=182|publisher=CABI |year= 2010 |accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Clyde sold his quarter-share of the family business for A$4 million to Kerry, who went on to become Australia's richest man.&lt;ref name="Milliken"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carmody"/&gt;

Packer was the Honorary Treasurer of the Children's Surgical Research Fund, a member of New South Wales Society for Crippled Children and New South Wales Committee Council for Civil Liberties.&lt;ref name="MLC Record"/&gt; Although a conservative politician, Packer supported freedom of speech, he voted against a bill to ban pornography.&lt;ref name="Milliken"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milliken 2"&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TNLpoUK-eUkC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=%22clyde+packer%22+politician&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u6jzUrPt_M&amp;sig=QQ6-OCP8bcpWtCv8cAhufYcKuDM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lH9fUtLLOu-ZiQeRhYGoCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=clyde&amp;f=false | title = Mother of Rock: The Lillian Roxon Story | last = Milliken | first = Robert | publisher = Black Inc | pages = 89–92, 181 | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-92186-656-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During early 1974 he worked with New South Wales Premier, [[Robert Askin]], to develop a series of ads run by [[John Singleton (Australian entrepreneur)|John Singleton]]'s agency against the incumbent Prime Minister, [[Gough Whitlam]], and his [[Australian Labor Party]] in the lead up to the [[Australian federal election, 1974|federal election]] in May.&lt;ref name="Langmore"&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=RnG_tEGjSloC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=%22clyde+packer%22+voting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zedgUqKWAsGgkAXZ9oGYCA&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22clyde%20packer%22%20voting&amp;f=false | title = Australian Dictionary of Biography, 1981–1990 | editor1-last = Langmore | editor1-first = Diane | editor2-last = Bennet | editor2-first = Darryl | chapter = Askin, Sir Robert (Robin) William | accessdate = 18 October 2013 | publisher = The Miegunyah Press | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-52285-382-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Counter-cultural involvement ==
After Clyde Packer's resignation from the family's media interests in 1972, he became briefly involved in the [[counter-culture]] – famously donning a [[kaftan]], claiming that it was "better than dieting".&lt;ref name="Lawson 2"/&gt; In the next year Packer established an adult sex magazine, ''Forum'', with [[Bettina Arndt]] as consulting editor, and later editor and then publisher.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/talkingheads/txt/s1951266.htm | title = Transcripts: Bettina Arndt | last = Thompson | first = Peter | authorlink = | work = [[Talking Heads (Australian TV series)|Talking Heads]] | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) | date = 18 June 2007 | accessdate = 17 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March that year he explained his motivation for launching the new magazine in the context of changes in the role of sexuality.&lt;ref name="Packer C"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/39361891?q=Packer%2C+Clyde+Forum&amp;c=article&amp;sort=holdings+desc&amp;_=1381927491049&amp;versionId=188158366 | title = Why I Publish ''Forum'' | last = Packer | first = Clyde | work = [[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | date = March–April 1973 | publisher = [[National Library of Australia]] | pages = 65–69 | issn = 0033-5002 }} Note: only an Abstract is available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to California in 1976 and thereafter rarely returned to Australia. In America, he pursued interests in film, surf culture, and magazine publishing. He bought ''[[Surfing Magazine]]'' in 1976 and during the mid-1980s he expanded his interests establishing the sister magazines, ''Bodyboarding Magazine'' and ''Volleyball''.&lt;ref name="Borte"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.surfline.com/surfing-a-to-z/surfing-magazine-history_920/ | title = ''Surfing Magazine'' History | last = Borte | first = Jason | publisher = Surfline | accessdate = 18 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 Packer released a book, ''No Return Ticket'', where he interviewed nine fellow Australian expatriates: [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], [[Gordon Chater]], Graham Fraser, [[Judith Anderson|Dame Judith Anderson]], [[James Wolfensohn]], [[Germaine Greer]], [[Maxwell Newton]], [[Zoe Caldwell]], and [[Sumner Locke Elliott]].&lt;ref name="No Return"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Packer | first1 = Clyde | title = No Return Ticket | publication-date = 1984 | publisher = [[Angus &amp; Robertson]] | isbn = 978-0-207-15028-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Canberra Times]]''{{'}} Mark Thomas the book is a "quirky, frothy anachronism" where the interviewees "whinge about the Australian cultural cringe in terms which no young Australian would find comprehensible".&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article122533267 | title = Tickets on Themselves |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] | date = 8 December 1984 | accessdate = 17 October 2013 | page = 25 | publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during 1984 the [[Costigan Commission]] issued a draft report into its investigation into the [[Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union|Painters and Dockers Union]] which implicated a prominent businessman codenamed "Goanna" in [[tax evasion]] and [[organised crime]] activities.&lt;ref name="Costigan"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://resources.news.com.au/files/2012/08/24/1226457/727948-aus-news-file-kerry-packer.pdf | title = Packermain | publisher = news.com.au | format = [[PDF]] | date = 24 August 2012 | accessdate = 17 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September that year news reports published leaked case summaries and Kerry outed himself as "Goanna" but denied all allegations.&lt;ref name="Costigan"/&gt; When Packer was contacted he observed that his brother "had his rights trampled on and his name defamed".&lt;ref name="Costigan"/&gt; The Costigan Commission had also contacted the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] to investigate Packer's own activities after a US surfing official claimed that one of Packer's local magazines was a front for drug-trafficking.&lt;ref name="Costigan"/&gt; Packer was never officially accused of any wrongdoing related to these investigations.&lt;ref name="Costigan"/&gt;

In January 1987 Packer told Ali Cromie from ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' that he had left Australia because he "would have a better future in America than Australia".&lt;ref name="Cromie"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19870123&amp;id=FfVjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=veQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3165,4932217 | title = The Other Packer: a View from Afar | last = Cromie | first = Ali | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]  | date = 23 January 1987 | accessdate = 17 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Packer had made documentaries but most of his subsequent work was in publishing.&lt;ref name="Cromie"/&gt;
He also ran a consultancy business, Magazine Investment and Management.&lt;ref name="Cromie"/&gt; Cromie described his relationship with Kerry "they got on well without being especially close.

'''David Gene Parker''' (born June 9, 1951), nicknamed "'''The Cobra'''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bighairplasticgrass.com/2011/06/day-of-the-cobra.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222105157/http://www.bighairplasticgrass.com/2011/06/day-of-the-cobra.html |archivedate=February 22, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American former player in [[Major League Baseball]]. He was the 1978 National League [[MVP]] and a two-time batting champion. Parker was the first professional athlete to earn an average of one million dollars per year, having signed a five-year, $5 million contract in January 1979. Parker's career achievements include 2712 hits, 339 [[home run]]s, 1493 runs batted in and a lifetime [[batting average]] of .290. Parker was also known as a solid defensive outfielder during the first half of his career, with a powerful arm, winning three consecutive [[Gold Glove]]s during his prime. From 1975 to 1979, he threw out 72 runners, including 26 in 1977.

He was a baseball [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] in 1977, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1985, 1986, and 1990. In the 1979 All-Star Game, Parker showcased his defensive ability and powerful arm by throwing out [[Jim Rice]] at third base and Angels catcher [[Brian Downing]] at home.  Parker also contributed an RBI on a [[sacrifice fly]] and was named the game's MVP.

==Early life==
Parker grew up in Cincinnati near [[Crosley Field]], where he learned to play baseball on the stadium's parking lots. His father, Dick Parker, was a shipping clerk in a foundry.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19780201&amp;id=NYMqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e1oEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3299,109912&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Parker attended Courter Tech High School. He has said his favorite sport was football, and he starred at tailback but injured a knee in a game during his senior year and gave up the game. Also a baseball star, one of his fondest memories is playing at [[Western Hills High School (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Western Hills High School]] (alma mater of [[Pete Rose]]), where he hit a home run that landed on the roof of a [[Frisch's]] restaurant.&lt;ref name="www2.cincinnati.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.cincinnati.com/blogs/recruiting/2012/03/09/dave-parker-looking-forward-to-cps-induction/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006173203/http://www2.cincinnati.com/blogs/recruiting/2012/03/09/dave-parker-looking-forward-to-cps-induction/ |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
In the early 1970s, as a member of the Pirates AAA minor league ball team Charleston (WV) Charlies, Parker hit a home run that landed on a coal car on a passing train and the ball was later picked up in Columbus, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;"Parker Excited to Return to Charleston", ''The Charleston Gazette'', May 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  He began his major league career on July 12, 1973 with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], for whom he played from 1973 to 1983.

At the 1977 MLB All-Star Game he became the only player in history to have worn batting helmets from two different teams—neither of them his own—in the same game, wearing a San Diego Padres helmet early on before swapping it out for a Cincinnati Reds one.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lukas (July 12, 2013) "http://espn.go.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/38106/uni-watch-all-star-helmet-mix-ups"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, he was National League batting champion, a feat he repeated in 1978 when he was named the [[National League]]'s [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]]. This was in spite of a collision at home plate with [[John Stearns]] during a game against the Mets on June 30, 1978, in which Parker fractured his jaw and cheekbone; he wore a specially constructed facemask in order to minimize his time away from the lineup.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lukas, [http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/080724 "Aggh! It's Dave Parker at the plate!,"] [[ESPN]] Page 2, July 29, 2008, accessed March 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pirates rewarded him with baseball's first million-dollar-per-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;Derek A. Reveron, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Yn2aYTGaVQsC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Dave+Parker+baseball&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Dave%20Parker%20baseball&amp;f=false "Dave Parker: Big Man, Big Bat and Baseball's Biggest Salary,"] ''Ebony'' October 1979: "the reported five=year, $5 million contract he agreed to in January."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iEIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=Dave+Parker+baseball&amp;cd=10#v=onepage&amp;q=Dave%20Parker%20baseball&amp;f=false "Parker's $5 Million Pact Says He's Baseball's Best,"] ''Jet'' February 22, 1979, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he was an instrumental part of the Pirates' [[1979 World Series|World Series]] championship team.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Parker as told to George Vass, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5zMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=Dave+Parker+baseball&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Game%20I%27ll%20Never%20Forget&amp;f=false "The Game I'll Never Forget,"] ''Baseball Digest'' April 1985, pp. 79-80: "I've been a big influence in some pennant races. We won the division three years when I was at Pittsburgh ('74, '75 and '79), and we won the World Series in 1979."&lt;/ref&gt;

During a game in 1979, a powerful hit he made to right field was very difficult to throw into the infield, because he had "knocked the cover off the ball."  One of the seams on the ball ruptured, making nearly half of the cover come loose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaseballzealot.com/hall-of-fame/hof-09-dave-parker |title="The Baseball Zealot", H0F '09 Dave Parker, accessed 14 Nov 2013 |publisher=Thebaseballzealot.com |date=December 9, 2008 |accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pittsburgh fans angered by his million-dollar contract threw "nuts and bolts and bullets and batteries" at him, as pitcher [[Kent Tekulve]] stated; a typo in a news story made it appear that they threw car batteries.&lt;ref name=Downey&gt;Mike Downey, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jzQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Dave+Parker+baseball&amp;cd=1#v=snippet&amp;q=Dave%20Parker%20left%20his%20anger&amp;f=false "Dave Parker Left His Anger, not His Talent, in Pittsburgh: During his second season in Cincinnati, he produced some big numbers, reminiscent of his happy days with the Pirates,"] ''Baseball Digest'' November 1985, repr. from ''The Los Angeles Times'': pp. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, at a point in his career when it looked as if he would one day rank among the game's all-time greats, [[Lawrence Ritter]] and [[Donald Honig]] included him in their book ''The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time''.&lt;ref&gt;New York: Crown, {{ISBN|0-517-54300-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors, noting that Parker had succeeded [[Roberto Clemente]] at the position, wrote, "Someone must have a fondness for right field in Pittsburgh."

Parker took after his Pirates teammate [[Willie Stargell]] in warming up in the on-deck circle with a [[sledgehammer]] (when most batters would use a simple lead-weighted bat).&lt;ref&gt;Rushin, Steve. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1136759/3/index.htm "Big Brew Ha-ha: Old hands Don Baylor and Dave Parker are showing the Brewers how to stay loose and win,"] ''Sports Illustrated'' (June 11, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, however, Parker's hitting suffered due to injuries, weight problems, and his increasing [[cocaine]] use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19850912&amp;id=KZYsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zfsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1255,4884497 "Reds Star Dave Parker Admits Cocaine Use,"] ''Lakeland Ledger'' September 12, 1985: "In his first public admission of drug use, Parker said that he bought cocaine from [Curtis] Strong and used it with him in Pittsburgh and in Philadelphia."&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the central figures in a drug scandal that spread through the major leagues.

===Later career===
At the end of the [[1983 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1983 season]], Parker became a free agent and signed with the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. In Cincinnati, his hometown, he returned to the form that made him an All-Star in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name=Downey/&gt; In [[1985 Cincinnati Reds season|1985]], he enjoyed his best season since he won the 1978 MVP with a .312 batting average, 34 home runs, and 125 RBI. Parker finished second in 1985 MVP voting to [[Willie McGee]].

Following the season, Parker was among several players who testified against a dealer in the [[Pittsburgh drug trials]]. Named as "regular users", Parker and six other players were suspended for the following season. The sentences were commuted, however, in exchange for donating ten percent of their base salaries to drug-related community service, submitting to random drug testing, and contributing 100 hours of drug-related [[community service]].&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;Cook, Ron. [http://www.post-gazette.com/pirates/200009291980bucs3.asp "The Eighties: A terrible time of trial and error,"] ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' (September 29, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bodley&gt;Bodley, Hal. [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/columnist/bodley/2004-03-04-bodley_x.htm "Ueberroth took action in 1986 cocaine scandal,"] ''USA Today'' (March 4, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1987 Cincinnati Reds season|1987 season]], Cincinnati traded Parker to the [[Oakland Athletics]] for [[José Rijo]] and [[Tim Birtsas]]. In Oakland, Parker was able to extend his career by spending most of his time as a [[designated hitter]]. Although injuries and age caught up to him to a degree &amp;ndash; he hit just .257 with 12 homers in 377 at-bats in [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|1988]] and .264 with 22 homers in 553 at-bats in [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|1989]] &amp;ndash; his veteran leadership was a significant factor in the A's consecutive World Series appearances.

Parker signed with the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] for the 1990 season and had a solid year as the [[1990 Milwaukee Brewers season|Brewers]]' DH with a .289 average and 21 home runs in 610 at-bats. Milwaukee opted for youth, however, at the end of the year and traded the aging Parker to the Angels for [[Dante Bichette]].

Parker's last season was 1991. He played for the [[1991 California Angels season|California Angels]] until late in the season when he was released. The [[1991 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] then signed him as insurance for the pennant race, and Parker hit .333 in limited action. Since he was acquired too late in the season, however, he did not qualify for inclusion on the post-season roster and thus was unable to play in the [[1991 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] against the [[1991 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]], which the Blue Jays lost in five games. Parker retired at the end of the season.

==Retirement==
Parker has served as a first-base coach for the [[Anaheim Angels]], a batting coach for the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|1998]], and a special hitting instructor for Pittsburgh. He owned several [[Popeyes Chicken &amp; Biscuits|Popeye's Chicken]] franchises in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jon Newberry|title=Franchise businesses opening doors of opportunity |url=http://cincinnati.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2007/12/31/story4.html|work=Business Courier of Cincinnati|date=December 28, 2007|accessdate=September 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; until selling his interest in them in 2012 after 25 years.&lt;ref name="espn1530.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn1530.com/onair/lance-mcalister-7818/former-red-cincinnati-legend-dave-parker-11548469/ |title=About Lance McAlister &amp;#124; Get Articles, Bio &amp; Show Info |publisher=ESPN 1530 |date= |accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker never got more than 24% of votes on Hall of Fame ballots, and his 15-year Baseball Writers' Association of America eligibility was exhausted on the 2011 ballot. He can now be considered for the [[Veterans Committee]] Expansion from 2014. Along with [[Keith Hernandez]] and (until 2017) [[Tim Raines]], Parker's involvement with the [[Pittsburgh drug trials]] has been the most likely cause of his not being voted into the Hall of Fame, serving as a precursor to those listed on the [[Mitchell Report]] not being voted into the Hall of Fame due to [[Banned substances in baseball in the United States|steroid abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2013-01-09/baseball-hall-of-fame-vote-results-bonds-clemens-peds-biggio-morris |title=Baseball Hall of Fame 2013 vote: No candidate elected by BBWAA &amp;#124; MLB |publisher=Sporting News |date=January 9, 2013 |accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Langosch |first=Jenifer |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101118&amp;content_id=16154154&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Dave Parker gets final shot at Hall of Fame &amp;#124; MLB.com |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker has had both of his knees replaced due to injuries from his playing career.&lt;ref&gt;[[KICU]] telecast, Oakland A's vs Chicago White Sox, August 17, 2008, per [[Dave Henderson]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he confirmed to the ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'' that he had been diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20130806/SPT04/308060096/Report-Dave-Parker-battling-Parkinson-s-disease?gcheck=1 |title=Cincinnati Enquirer &amp;#124; cincinnati.com |publisher=News.cincinnati.com |date= |accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is involved in raising money to find a cure for Parkinson's disease through the Dave Parker 39 Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/dave-parker-doesnt-let-parkinsons-stop-him/c-221635114|title='Cobra' not letting Parkinson's hold him back|first=Bill|last=Ladson|date=March 30, 2017|accessdate=July 18, 2018|work=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker has six children. He currently resides in [[Loveland, Ohio]], near Cincinnati, with his wife, Kellye.&lt;ref name="www2.cincinnati.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="espn1530.com"/&gt;

'''Louise Yvonne Faulkner''' (born 7 April 1937) and '''Charmian Christabel Alexis Faulkner''' (born 30 October 1977) were a mother and daughter who [[Missing person|went missing]] from  [[St Kilda, Victoria]], Australia, in 1980. {{As of|2014}}, no-one has been charged over the disappearance and no bodies have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/daughter-still-hopes-for-the-call-to-unlock-a-34yearold-murder-mystery-20140801-zzbxt.html |title= Daughter still hopes for the call to unlock a 34-year-old murder mystery |date=2 August 2014 |first=Tammy |last=Mills |newspaper=[[The Age]] |accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Louise was born on 7 April 1937 in [[Colac, Victoria]] and was the youngest of three children.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Charmian was born on 30 October 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSob=c&amp;GSmid=47914829&amp;GRid=141867548&amp; |title=Charmian Faulkner |first=Alyssa |last=McIntosh |work=Find A Grave Memorial |id=141867548 |date=27 January 2015 |accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Last confirmed sighting ==
Whilst residing at Acland St, St. Kilda, Louise Faulkner developed a friendship with Corrine Wylde, a neighbour in the same block of flats. On 25 April 1980, [[Anzac Day]] in Australia, Louise and Charmian attended a first birthday party for Wylde's son. Faulkner told Wylde that she was going to visit her boyfriend in [[Gippsland]]. The following day, Wylde saw the two Faulkners get into a white [[Ute (vehicle)|ute]] with an older man. This was the last confirmed sighting of either of them. Louise Faulkner was aged 43 and Charmian was two at the time of their disappearance. The only suspect was her lover 60 year old George Sutherland whom Louise Faulkner named as Charmian's father.&lt;ref name = "SMH1"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.smh.com.au//breaking-news-national/police-offer-reward-for-mum-mystery-20101006-167my.html | work =[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | title = Police offer reward for 'mum mystery' | first = Greg | last = Roberts | date = 6 October 2010 | accessdate = 24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Police investigation ==
On 9 June 1980 preliminary investigations of the disappearances began. Inquiries were conducted over the following 12 months with friends and associates of Louise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kqworumadRcC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;q=george%20sutherland%20faulkner  |accessdate=24 July 2016 |pages=220–235 |title=Badlands: Australia's 13 Most Intriguing True Murders |last=Houlihan |first=Liam |date= 1 August 2010 |publisher=Melbourne University Publishing|isbn=9780522859768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coronial inquest ==
In August 2006 a [[Inquest|coronial inquest]] was held into the disappearance and death of Louise and Charmian Faulkner and found that the pair were probably murdered.&lt;ref name = "SMH1" /&gt; The inquest was re-convened in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/daughter-haunted-by-28-year-mystery/story-e6frf7jo-1111115644627 |title=Daughter haunted by 28-year mystery |newspaper=Herald Sun |date=26 February 2008 |author=Dina Rosendorff |accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that occasion the coroner ruled the deaths foul play, but said there was not enough evidence to link anyone to the killings.&lt;ref name = "ABC1"&gt;[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (18 March 2008).

'''Dominic A. LeBlanc''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|PC|MP}} (born December 14, 1967), is a Canadian lawyer and politician. He has been the member of parliament for the [[New Brunswick]] riding of [[Beauséjour (electoral district)|Beauséjour]] since 2000. Since July 2018, he has been serving as [[Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Northern Affairs and Internal Trade|Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Northern affairs and Internal Trade]]. LeBlanc is the son of former Member of Parliament, [[Senate of Canada|Senator]] and [[Governor General of Canada]], [[Roméo LeBlanc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/romeo-leblanc-1927-2009/|title=Romeo LeBlanc, 1927-2009|work=Maclean's|date=June 24, 2009|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LeBlanc ran for leadership of Liberal Party in 2008 but dropped out of [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 2009|the race]] to endorse [[Michael Ignatieff]], who was later acclaimed leader. With the resignation of Ignatieff after the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 federal election]] LeBlanc was considered a likely candidate in [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 2013|the race]] to succeed him as party leader, but declined on running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/leblanc-eyes-liberal-leadership-1.1117264|title=LeBlanc eyes Liberal leadership|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=2011-05-03|accessdate=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dominic"&gt;{{cite news|title=Justin Trudeau's leadership bid backed by LeBlanc|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-s-leadership-bid-backed-by-leblanc-1.1299230|accessdate=May 16, 2018|newspaper=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, 2015, he was appointed the [[Leader of the Government in the House of Commons]] in the present [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]], headed by [[Justin Trudeau]]. On May 31, 2016, upon the resignation of [[Hunter Tootoo]] from the Ministry, LeBlanc also assumed the role of [[Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard]]. On August 19, 2016, LeBlanc was replaced by [[Bardish Chagger]] as [[Leader of the Government in the House of Commons]].&lt;ref name="CBC News"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bardish Chagger adds government House leader to small business, tourism duties|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cabinet-shuffle-house-learder-1.3728243|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 18, 2018, LeBlanc was shuffled from the role of [[Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard]] to the role of [[Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Northern Affairs and Internal Trade]].

==Early life and education==
LeBlanc was born in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], to [[Roméo LeBlanc]] and Joslyn "Lyn" Carter. As a child, he baby-sat [[Justin Trudeau|Justin]], [[Alexandre Trudeau|Alexandre]], and [[Michel Trudeau]], the children of then-Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]]. He has remained friends with Justin Trudeau, with whom he is currently serving with in the House of Commons, and endorsed [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 2013|his candidacy for Liberal leader]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="Dominic" /&gt;

===Chrétien and Martin governments===
During the Liberal Party's time in power LeBlanc served as [[Parliamentary Secretary]] to the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]], from January 13, 2003, to December 11, 2003, and was the chair of the Atlantic Caucus.

On July 10, 2004, he was sworn-in as a Member of the Privy Council for Canada and appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the [[Leader of the Government in the House of Commons (Canada)|Leader of the Government in the House of Commons]] and Deputy Chief Government Whip. He has served on the Special Committee on Non-Medical Use of Drugs, and the Standing Committees on Fisheries and Oceans, Transport and Government Operations, National Defence and Veterans Affairs, and Public Accounts, Procedures and House Affairs, and International Trade.

===In opposition===
In January 2006, he was named Official Opposition critic for international trade and later that year he was co-chair of the [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 2006|2006 Liberal Party leadership convention]] in [[Montreal]]. In January 2007, he was named by the Honourable [[Stéphane Dion]], Vice Chair - Liberal Party of Canada Policy and Platform Committee and In October of that year, he was named Official Opposition critic for intergovernmental affairs. In January 2009, he was named by the Honourable [[Michael Ignatieff]] as the critic for justice and attorney general. Before the return of Parliament in September 2010, Ignatieff shuffled his Shadow Cabinet and appointed LeBlanc as the Liberal critic for national defence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20100918120619/http://www.nationalpost.com/news/Ignatieff+shuffles+shadow+cabinet/3491323/story.html .Ignatieff shuffles shadow cabinet]&lt;/ref&gt; Following LeBlanc's re-election in the 2011 federal election, interim Liberal leader [[Bob Rae]] appointed LeBlanc as the Liberal Party's Foreign Affairs Critic.

====2008 leadership bid====
On October 27, 2008, LeBlanc was the first candidate to officially announce his intention to seek the leadership of the Liberal party to replace Stéphane Dion. Former leadership candidates Michael Ignatieff and Bob Rae came forward shortly after LeBlanc's announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/leblanc-seeks-manley-tests-liberal-support/article662227/|publisher=Globe and Mail|author=Brian Laghi and Omar El Akkad|date=2008-10-27|accessdate=2015-05-25|title=LeBlanc seeks, Manley tests Liberal support}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His supporters included top staffers in the prime minister's office under [[Jean Chrétien]], such as his former chief of staff [[Percy Downe]], and [[Tim Murphy (Canadian politician)|Tim Murphy]], chief of staff under [[Paul Martin]]. Some senior organizers in [[Gerard Kennedy]]'s 2006 leadership bid were also with LeBlanc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timestranscript.canadaeast.com/newstoday/article/463705 Beausejour MP to run for federal Liberal leadership, wants to be a voice for middle-class, younger generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828232530/http://timestranscript.canadaeast.com/newstoday/article/463705 |date=August 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, 2008, LeBlanc announced he was dropping out of the leadership race because he felt a leader needed to be put in place as soon as possible and that he was throwing his support behind Ignatieff. The next day Rae dropped out of the race and Ignatieff was acclaimed leader when Dion stepped down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20081208/dion_coalition_081208/20081208?hub=TopStories|publisher = CTV|date = 2008-12-08|accessdate = 2008-12-08|title = Dion to step aside; LeBlanc supports Ignatieff|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081209064032/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20081208/dion_coalition_081208/20081208?hub=TopStories|archivedate = 2008-12-09|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/rae-bows-out-offers-unqualified-support-for-ignatieff-as-liberal-leader-1.732354|title=Rae bows out, offers 'unqualified' support for Ignatieff as Liberal leader|work=CBC News|date=December 9, 2008|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011-2015====
LeBlanc retained his seat in the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 election]], while the Liberals dropped down to third place in the House of Commons.

Regarding the race for the leadership of the Liberal Party, LeBlanc, a prospective leadership candidate, puts it, the next leader needs to commit 10 to 15 years of his or her life "occupied exclusively" with rebuilding the Liberal party and winning elections.&lt;ref name="The Ottawa Citizen"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ottawa Citizen - Liberals set to lay out latest leadership race rules|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Liberals+latest+leadership+race+rules/7200075/story.html|work=The Ottawa Citizen|publisher=The Ottawa Citizen|accessdate=September 12, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emma C. de Guzman''' (born December 8, 1949) is a [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[Roman Catholic]] widow, laywoman, stigmatist and claimed [[Marian visionary]]. She is the co-founder, along with the late Sister Soledad Gaviola, of the Catholic lay group association ''La Pieta'', dedicated to a Marian devotion under the title ''Mother of Love, Peace and Joy''. Guzman claims to have first seen the Virgin Mary on the Feast of the [[Nativity of Mary]] in 1991.

She is reputedly notable for her alleged Marian visions under trance, particularly the golden dust ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Escarchas'', [[English language|English]]: "''Frost''") which allegedly manifests on her face during her trances. She claims to have communicated with [[Jesus Christ]], the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], various angels&lt;ref name="NenaSunico"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.catholic.org/saints/angelstories/?story=118&amp;page=5 |last=Sunico |first=Nena |title=My angel brought me home — Angel Stories |publisher=Catholic Online |access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and souls seeking [[penitence]] and has been observed by various high ranking Filipino Catholic prelates, recorded in photographs and on live video. The group specifically seeks to promote prayer and peace to various nations through any particular [[Marian devotion]].&lt;ref name=joy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherofjoy.com/miracles.htm |title=Mother of Joy House of Prayer |publisher=Motherofjoy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The La Pieta prayer group, along with its apparition, stigmata, and miraculous events are currently unapproved, though pending investigation by the [[Holy See]]. The group is openly tolerated and endorsed by various leading international bishops, including the former [[Papal Nuncio|Apostolic Papal Nuncio]] to the Philippines, [[Archbishop]] [[Antonio Franco]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Jaime Lachica Sin]], and Cardinal [[Francis Eugene George]].&lt;ref name=joy/&gt;

==History==
Previously in 1984, Emma de Guzman was an impoverished [[domestic helper]] in [[Singapore]], and later sought to find work in an overseas nanny housekeeping job in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. She is also the mother of three children to whom she worked to financially support them.&lt;ref name=Bibsy&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140826113553/http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/sundaylifestyle/sundaylifestyle/view/20091213-241660/What-is-the-real-message--of-the-Virgin--to-Emma-de-Guzman Carballo, Bibsy M., "What is the real message of the Virgin to Emma de Guzman?", ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'', December 13, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Emma attributes her first mystical encounter with a [[whirlwind]] at a church, where a leaf landed on her foot which bore a piece of paper enlisting a potential job for her in [[Ontario]], Canada.

In [[Canada]], her best friend, Sol Gaviola, had organized a pilgrimage to the Fatima Shrine in Youngstown, New York, in 1991, and took her along.&lt;ref name=Bibsy/&gt; Emma mentioned that the Virgin Mary taught her how to pray the [[Rosary based prayers#Holy Rosary|Holy Rosary]], and requested her numerous times to pray them over, and over again through the course of three successive nights. In addition, she claims that the Virgin Mary emphatically immersed Emma's emotions through the various [[mysteries of the Rosary]] as if she were actually living each decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/prayers/mystery.php |title=The Mysteries of the Rosary |publisher=Catholic Online |access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emma claims to have met [[Jesus Christ]] on two separate occasions. The first occasion was in the old chapel of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] in [[Youngstown, New York]], under the guise of an old man.&lt;ref name=gorilla&gt;[http://www.goldstardailynews.com.ph/opinion/the-mystical-experience-of-emma-de-guzman.html Gorillo, Cesar. "The mystical experience of Emma de Guzman", ''Gold Star Daily'', January 21, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The second occasion was during a trance, to which she claims that Jesus directed her to a copy of the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]]. Many of Emma's followers during her Wednesday group meetings attested to the fragrances&lt;ref name="NenaSunico" /&gt; and oils which anonymously oozed out of religious statues in the home.

In 2009, a letter was circulated by unknown parties, claiming the Virgin Mary predicted the results of the upcoming presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiancorrespondent.com/7037/blessed-virgin-mary-says-noynoy-will-be-president-in-2010/ Farol, Paul. "Blessed Virgin Mary says Noynoy will be President in 2010", AsianCorrespondent.com, September 18, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Description of the Virgin===
According to de Guzman, the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] wears a full white tunic and has a yellow golden sash and a golden-bordered veil surrounded by light. A statue specific to Guzman's description was made for Marian veneration.

According to Emma de Guzman, the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] has only chosen to appear to her annually on two specific dates, the [[Nativity of Mary]] (September 8) and the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]] (December 8) which also coincides with Emma's birthday. An exception occurred in December 2009, when Emma refused to broadcast the message she had allegedly received to the public.&lt;ref name=Bibsy/&gt; She also notes that the [[Virgin Mary]] does not arrive immediately, but is first introduced by singing angels.&lt;ref name="NenaSunico" /&gt;

===Mountain of Salvation===
Members of the La Pieta Group asked the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lipa|Archbishop of Batangas]] [[Ramon Arguelles]] permission to pray at the mountains, and requested a [[Holy Mass]], both of which were authorized by the Archbishop. The mountainous site of the apparition was later referred ''The Mountain of Salvation'' by de Guzman. Two locations were chosen by de Guzman, [[Cebu]]&lt;ref name=Ballescas&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/freeman-opinion/756684/december-8-message-mama-mary-filipinos Ballescas, "December 8 message from Mama Mary for Filipinos", ''The Freeman'', December 10, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Batangas]], which were land donations from her [[benefactor (law)|benefactors]]. The group also has non-Filipino members, especially among [[Americans|American]], [[Canadians|Canadian]], [[Poles|Polish]], and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] devotees who travel to the shrine to witness the alleged Marian apparition.

==Miraculous claims==

===Manifestation of facial golden dust===
According to an Action News 3 New York documentary on Emma's claims of apparition, belief in golden glitters during apparitions date back to 1917, and are commonly referred to as ''Escarchas''. After obtaining samples of Emma's collected gold dust and compared them to common glitter found in [[holy cards]], electron analysis showed no difference between the two materials yet Emma's golden dust remained the same when exposed to high contents of [[Hydrochloric acid]].{{clarify|date=August 2014}} Followers of Emma maintains that the glitters appear mysteriously on her face during trances, as recorded in various video recordings. Furthermore, the golden dust collectively amounts on its own, saved on a white sheet where de Guzman sits during her apparition.

===Bodily removal of roses===
On November 4, 1995, during one of Emma's trances to which she allegedly claims to experience the [[Passion of Jesus Christ]], Emma drew out five small, thornless, rose buds out of her chest, filled with blood and bodily mucus. Later accounts of the videotaped event claims a hole on her chest, which later closed.

===Writings in ancient Koine Greek===
Followers of Emma also attest to her various letters written in [[Ancient Greek]], containing scriptural passages of the [[Gospel of Saint John]], written under trance. In 2006, Witnesses claim that while Emma was being dictated to write on paper, her eyeline sight was elevated into the ceiling not looking into the writing pad, yet still continued to write a foreign language, in perfect straight lining on paper. Emma claims the writings were given by [[Saint John the Evangelist]], and that she has no previous education in Ancient Greek or any other language, as well as doctrinal or theological knowledge of anything she has written down. At the time of the event, Emma did not have full proficiency in the [[English language]].

A [[Catholic priest]], Father Renato Lopez, reviewed the actual physical letter and ruled that the language in which Emma wrote down was not Classical Greek but [[Koine Greek]], remaining faithful to the timeline in which the [[Gospel of Saint John]] could possibly have been originally recorded.

Furthermore, the content of the Gospel of Saint John written down by Emma in Koine Greek refers to the first letter of Saint John, chapter 4:1 which pertains to a warning not to quickly believe any spirit or seer which claims to be from God but rather seek true discernment through prayer.

===Mediatrix===
In September 2012, the Feast of the [[Nativity of Mary]], Emma stated that the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] revealed her maternal role as  ''[[Mediatrix]] before the Mediator'', a special Marian title associated by many Filipino Catholics as in reference to [[Our Lady Mediatrix of All Graces]].&lt;ref&gt;http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/66814/messages-from-mama-mary&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partial stigmata===
Video recordings of Emma's partial stigmata manifesting include: forehead wounds, back scourging, palms, and foot.

===Encounter with purgatorian souls===
Emma has also claimed to have met with souls from [[Purgatory]], brought by [[Magdalena de Pazzi|Saint Magdalena of Pazzi]], requesting prayers for the liberation of their souls under the penalty of [[Seraphim|Seraphic]] fire.

===Encounter with female saints===
Emma claims to have either seen and/or conversed with [[Saint Bernadette Soubirous]], [[Saint Teresa of Avila]], and [[Saint Faustina Kowalska]].

==Opposition to the RH bill==
Emma de Guzman, a devout Catholic, publicly opposes the passage of the [[Reproductive Health bill]] in the Philippines. On December 8, 2008, she claimed that the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] wept and rebuked politicians and laypersons who do not respect the sanctity of life, as well as to warn that the Reproductive Health Bill as a law will bring forward the suffering and destruction of many souls. In addition, she also opposes the use of [[contraception]] and [[abortion]] among her followers.

==Church position==

===Ecclesiastical endorsement===
Emma de Guzman is known for receiving approbations from various notable Roman Catholic clerics, namely the former [[Papal Nuncio|Apostolic Papal Nuncio]] to the Philippines, [[Archbishop]] [[Antonio Franco]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Jaime Lachica Sin]], Cardinal [[Francis Eugene George]],  Bishop [[James Michael Moynihan]],  [[Monsignor]] John Canary, the [[Vicar-General]] of the [[Archdiocese of Chicago]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In a [[circular letter (religion)|circular]] dated November 18, 2004, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kalookan]], authorised by Bishop Deogracias Iñiguez granted an official [[Imprimatur]] on the La Pieta house prayer booklet, along with its religious Marian hymns.

On December 2, 2012, the statue of ''"Our Mother of Love, Peace and Joy''" endorsed by de Guzman was featured in the ''Intramuros Grand Marian Procession'', a religious Catholic event sponsored by the [[Cofradia de la Inmaculada Concepcion]] and [[Archdiocese of Manila]].

===Investigation by the Holy See===
Various materials and correspondence were submitted to the [[Holy See]] in 2010 for further research and investigation. The prayer group, ''La Pieta House of Prayer'', declines to provide any information regarding its submission, contents and correspondence to the general public. The apostolate group claims full obeisance to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and its verdict on the recorded apparitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapietainternational.com/index.php/events |title=Schedule of Events |publisher=Lapietainternational.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613192812/http://lapietainternational.com/index.php/events |archivedate=June 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5092">'''Evan Shelby''' (1720 – 4 December 1794) was a Welsh-American trapper and militia officer on the frontier of the Southern colonies.

==Early life==
Evan Shelby was born in [[Tregaron]], [[Cardiganshire]], Wales, in 1720 (some sources give 1719). His father was also Evan Shelby; his mother was Catherine Davies Morgan. The family moved to the American colonies in about 1734, settling first in [[Pennsylvania]], but later moving to [[Maryland]]. The younger Evan worked on a farm near [[Frederick, Maryland]], named "Mountain of Wales".&lt;ref name="NCPedia"&gt;Paul W. Beasley, [http://ncpedia.org/biography/shelby-evan "Evan Shelby"] in William S. Powell, ed., ''Dictionary of North Carolina Biography'' (UNC Press 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

==On the American frontier==

Shelby signed the [[Fincastle Resolutions]]&lt;ref&gt;Thad Tate, "The Fincastle Resolutions: Southwest Virginia's Commitment" ''Journal of the Roanoke Valley Historical Society'' IX (9)(1975).&lt;/ref&gt; and actively supported the war for American independence, serving on a boycott committee and eventually taking the lead in defending Virginia's western frontier. He rose to the rank of colonel in 1777, in raids against the [[Chickamauga Cherokee|Chickamauga]].&lt;ref&gt;Zella Armstrong, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XWEU0MaU87kC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;ots=SROw0rpu_j&amp;dq=Evan%20Shelby%20Chickamauga&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage ''The History of Hamilton County and Chattanooga, Tennessee''] (Overmountain Press 1992): 27-28. {{ISBN|9780932807915}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1787, he became a brigadier general in western [[North Carolina]], and was even elected governor of the [[State of Franklin]], a post which he declined.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Foster, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oq2QKloMleEC&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=Evan%20Shelby%20Franklin&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage ''Franklin the Stillborn State: And the Sevier-Tipton Political Feud''] (Overmountain Press 2006): 10-12. {{ISBN|9781570722592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Shelby married twice; his first wife was Letitia Cox, with whom he was the parent of five sons and three daughters. Their son [[Isaac Shelby]] was later the [[governor of Kentucky]]. Letitia Cox Shelby died in 1777. There were three more children born into Evan Shelby's second marriage, to Isabella Elliot, in 1787.&lt;ref name="NCPedia" /&gt;

'''Frederic Lloyd''', [[OBE]] (1 July 1918 – 27 July 1995), was an English theatre manager.  Most notably, Lloyd was the General Manager of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] from 1951 until its closure in 1982.

==Biography==
Lloyd was born into an ecclesiastical family near [[Oxford]], England.  During the [[Second World War]] he worked with the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, the precursor of the [[Arts Council]].&lt;ref name=Times&gt;''[[The Times]]'' obituary, 23 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 he was a director of the [[Festival of Britain]],&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; and in September of that year he was appointed General Manager of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] and of the [[Savoy Theatre]], in succession to Alfred Nightingale.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, Appendix, p. v&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to his D'Oyly Carte duties, Lloyd was a member of the council of management of the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] and played an important part in saving the orchestra's tour of [[Americas|America]] in 1963 at a critical time in the RPO's fortunes.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1961 to 1982, Lloyd was also secretary of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust.  In 1966 he was elected President of the Theatrical Managers' Association.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 23 December 1966, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

With D'Oyly Carte's closure, Lloyd retired from theatre management, although he continued to sit on numerous committees.  He was chairman of the governors of the [[Royal Academy of Music]], 1980-83, and trustee and chairman of the general committee of the [[Garrick Club]], 1976-84.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;  He wrote articles on [[Elgar]] and [[Beethoven]], and he collaborated with [[Robin Wilson (mathematician)|Robin Wilson]] on an official history of the D'Oyly Carte Company in 1984.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

On his retirement, he moved from his London home in [[St John's Wood]] to the village of [[Strathpeffer]], Scotland, near [[Inverness]], where he became a lay-preacher at his local church.  His wife Valerie died in 1991.  They had two sons.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

Lloyd died in Inverness at age 77.&lt;ref&gt;obituary: ''The Independent'' (London), 9 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon arrival in the Sicilian capital, George went immediately to the palace and found service with the [[Normans|Norman]] count, [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]].

__TOC__

==Rise and early career: subjugation of Apulia==
[[File:Ponte dell'Ammiraglio, Palermo.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Ponte dell'Ammiraglio|Admiral's Bridge]] in Palermo.]]
George of Antioch's prior knowledge of the Zirid administration, his connections with an Armenian official in [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid Egypt]], and knowledge of Greek and Arabic led to his rise in the Norman administration. He rose to the title of ''familiaris'' of the court and by 1123 had risen to second in command in Christodulus' navy. In these years, he also served as a frequent envoy to the Fatimid court in Cairo. In a Norman attack on Mahdia that year, George captured the fortress of [[ad-Dimas]], located on the coast of Tunisia, but the campaign resulted in a decisive Norman defeat at the hands of the Zirid emir, [[Abu'l-Hasan al-Hasan ibn Ali|al-Hasan ibn Ali]]. In the following five years, George overshadowed Chrisotodulus and by 1127 had replaced him in the position of emir of Palermo. In that year, both emirs were present at Montescaglioso with Count Roger, but Christodulus seems to have died soon thereafter and George succeeded him.

George was instrumental in fully subduing independent-minded [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]] in the years following Roger's succession there. In 1129, George brought sixty ships to bear on besieged [[Bari]], then rebellious under Prince [[Grimoald Alferanites]]. Surrender was forced, but Roger pardoned the prince. In 1131, Roger demanded that the citizens of [[Amalfi]] turn over the keys to the castle as well as full control over their city's defences. The Amalfitans refused and George blockaded the city and captured all Amalfitan ships, forcing the city to surrender. In 1132, George was given the title ''ammiratus ammiratorum'', which translates as ''Admiral of Admirals'' in modern English, but was understood as ''[[Emir of Emirs]]'' to his contemporaries. He was also given the Greek title "Archon of Archons".

In 1143, George founded the [[Greek Orthodox]] church of [[S. Maria dell'Ammiraglio]], also known as the Martorana, in Palermo. In the church there is a contemporary mosaic depicting George, as well as a mosaic showing Roger II being crowned by Christ.

==Height of career: conquests in Greece and Africa==
[[File:Georgiosbulle.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Seal of George of Antioch, bearing the titles of his offices (''archōn archontōn'' and ''amēras'') in Greek.]]
In 1146, George captured [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]] and established Sicilian authority in North Africa on a permanent basis. He had already captured several minor coastal cities in the fifteen years prior, but Mahdia, which had been in the hands of [[Abul-Hasan al-Hasan ibn Ali]] since the failed attack of 1123, did not capitulate yet.

In 1147, Roger attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]], which continued to contest his gains in southern Italy. George he sent from [[Otranto]] with seventy [[galley]]s to assault [[Corfu]]. According to [[Nicetas Choniates]], the island capitulated due to the imperial tax burden and George's promises. Leaving a garrison, George sailed on to the [[Peloponnesus]]. He sacked [[Athens]] and quickly moved on to the [[Ionian Islands]]. He ravaged the coast all along [[Euboea]] and the [[Gulf of Corinth]] and penetrated as far as [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], where he pillaged the silk factories and carried off the Jewish silk weavers. George capped the expedition with a sack of [[Corinth]], in which the relics of [[Theodore of Amasea|Saint Theodore]] were stolen, and then returned to Sicily.

In 1148, George finally conquered Mahdia. Antecedently, the governor of [[Gabès]] had revolted against his overlord, al-Hasan, and promised to deliver his city to Roger II if he was confirmed as governor. War inevitably broke out in the summer of 1148. George led a fleet against Mahdia. The sultan voluntarily went into exile, taking with him very little treasure, and Mahdia capitulated. The cities of [[Sfax]] and Soussa surrendered soon after. [[Kingdom of Africa|Tunisia (Ifriqiya)]] was incorporated into the Kingdom of Sicily, which reached its apogee through George's conquests, containing not only Sicily and the [[Mezzogiorno]], but also Corfu and Tunisia.

In 1149, Corfu was retaken and George took a fleet of forty ships up the [[Bosphorus]] to the walls of [[Constantinople]], where he tried to land. Failing this, he ravaged a few ''villae'' on the Asian coast and fired arrows at the imperial palace. He died soon after, in year 546 [[Hijri year|AH]] according to [[Ibn al-Athir]], corresponding to 1151 or 1152. He was succeeded in his offices by [[Philip of Mahdia]].

George was a polyglot and very cultured man. He founded the church of San Michele in [[Mazara del Vallo]]. Besides that and his eponymous church, George of Antioch left as an architectural monument the seven-arched Admiral's Bridge over the River Oreto by Palermo where, on May 27, 1860, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s [[Redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]] first fought the troops of [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies]] in the ''[[Risorgimento]]''.

In [[Arthurian legend]], '''Gringolet''' is Sir [[Gawain]]'s [[horse]]. A sturdy [[war horse|charger]], with distinctive ears, Gringolet was known far and wide for his ability in combat, and appears in very many [[romance (heroic literature)|romances]] in several different languages.

==Derivation of name==
[[Israel Gollancz]] in the early 20th century suggested that Gringolet was derived from the giant [[Wade (folklore)|Wade]]'s magic boat, Wingalet - one form of magical transport (horse) being substituted for an earlier one (boat).&lt;ref&gt;I. Gollancz, 'Gringolet, Gawain's Horse', in ''Saga Book of the Viking Society for Northern Research'' (1980) p. 106-7&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally accepted is the suggestion by the prominent Arthurian scholar [[Roger Sherman Loomis]] that the [[French language|French]] name Gringolet derived from either the [[Welsh language|Welsh]]  ''guin-calet'' ("white and hardy"), or ''keincaled'' ("handsome and hardy")&lt;ref&gt;Roger Sherman Loomis, ''Arthurian tradition &amp; Chr&amp;eacute;tien de Troyes'' (1949), p.158, 159 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=X4dcAAAAMAAJ books.google]). Loomis defers to the suggestion by Tolkien *Gwyngalet 'white-hard'", and cites Heinrich Zimmer for the other etymology.&lt;/ref&gt; - linked to a wider Celtic tradition of heroic white horses with red ears.&lt;ref&gt;H. M. Mustard trans, ''Wolfram von Eschenbach: Parzival'' (New York 1961)p. 183n&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
His earliest appearance is in [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' ''[[Erec and Enide]]''; in that poem he is borrowed by [[Sir Kay]] to joust against [[Erec]]. Even Gringolet cannot prevent Kay from losing to the protagonist. In the [[Lancelot-Grail]] Cycle, Gawain wins Gringolet from a [[Saxons|Saxon]] warrior{{citeneeded|date=May 2016}}; a different story of the acquisition is given in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]'', where the horse bears the mark of, and comes from the stable of, the Grail castle - part of the gradual displacement of Gawain by Percival and the story of the grail.&lt;ref&gt;H. M. Mustard trans, ''Wolfram von Eschenbach: Parzival'' (New York 1961)p. 287 and p. xli&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the [[Middle English]] poem ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', Gawain sets out atop Gringolet in search of the Green Chapel.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien trans, ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' (London 1995) p. 34-6&lt;/ref&gt; Lines 600-604 of the poem describe Gringolet's ornate appearance in being readied for the journey:

:''The bridle was embossed and bound with bright gold;''
:''So were the furnishings of the fore-harness and the fine skirts.''
:''The crupper and the caparison accorded with the saddle-bows,''
:''And all was arrayed on red with nails of richest gold,''
:''Which glittered and glanced like gleams of the sun.''

==Gawain's attachment==
Gawain is always shown as attached to Gringolet, caring for his horse, and talking to it as to a beloved pet or companion.&lt;ref&gt;E. Kooper ed., ''Arthurian Literature'' (1999) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; When (in one tale) Gringolet is killed beneath him in combat, Gawain is seized with battle fury, and runs mad, his strength amplified, until nightfall.&lt;ref&gt;J. Matthews, ''Sir Gawain'' (2003)  p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Independent Paralympic Athletes Team''', a team consisting of refugee and asylee Paralympic athletes, will compete at the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016. Its creation was announced on 5 August 2016.

== Participation ==
The team was announced on August 5, 2016 by the International Paralympic Committee.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.paralympic.org/news/refugees-compete-dedicated-team-rio-2016-paralympics|title=Refugees to compete in dedicated team at Rio 2016 Paralympics|last=|first=|date=August 5, 2016|website=International Paralympic Committee|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|access-date=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants were nominated for the team by National Paralympic Committees who were aware of qualified sportspeople. The International Paralympic Committee stepped in to assist with getting athletes ready by doing a number of things, including insuring that athletes were [[Disability sport classification|classified]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 26 August 2016, the IPC announced the two members of the refugee team: Ibrahim Al Hussein of Syria, who will compete in the S10 50 and 100 m freestyle swimming events, and Shahrad Nasajpour of Iran, who will compete in F37 Discus.&lt;ref name="bbc-refugeeteam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rio Paralympics: Two refugee Para-athletes named for Rio Paralympics|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/disability-sport/37194903|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ipc-hussein"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ibrahim Al Hussein spreads message of hope|url=https://www.paralympic.org/news/ibrahim-al-hussein-spreads-message-hope|publisher=IPC|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Sainsbury]] was the [[chef de mission]] of the team; Sainsbury has previously been the chef de mission of the [[Great Britain at the Paralympics|British Paralympic Team]] at five [[Paralympics]].&lt;ref name="bbc-refugeeteam"/&gt;

== Disability classifications ==
{{main article|Disability sport classification}}
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five [[Summer Paralympic Games#Disability categories|disability categories]]; [[amputation]], the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; [[cerebral palsy]]; [[wheelchair]] athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; [[visual impairment]], including [[blindness]]; [[Les Autres sport classification|Les autres]], any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example [[dwarfism]] or [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name=class1&gt;{{cite web |title=Paralympics categories explained |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |date=3 September 2008 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/09/03/2354016.htm?site=paralympics/2008 |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=class2&gt;{{cite news |title=Making sense of the categories |publisher=[[BBC|BBC Sport]] |date=6 October 2000 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics2000/paralympics/959701.stm |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[Paralympic Games#Summer sports|Paralympic sport]] then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as [[Athletics at the 2016 Summer Paralympics|athletics]], divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example [[Swimming at the 2016 Summer Paralympics|swimming]], group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.&lt;ref name=class3&gt;{{cite news |title=A-Z of Paralympic classification |publisher=[[BBC|BBC Sport]] |date=28 August 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/7586684.stm |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jack Tafari''' (born 31 October 1946 in [[Gravesend, Kent]], [[United Kingdom]], died &lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/10/jack-tafari-obituary|title=Jack Tafari obituary|first=Kevin|last=Brown|date=10 May 2016|work=theguardian.com|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20 April 2016 in [[Accra, Ghana]], [[Africa]]), was a sometimes homeless [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] [[activist]] who advocated for himself and other homeless people, in the USA and the UK. He was best known for promoting "sanctioned tent cities" as transitional [[affordable housing|housing]] for [[Vagrancy (people)|homeless people]], including himself, in [[Portland, Oregon]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-1315-the_duke_of_dignity_village.html|title=the duke of dignity village|work=wweek.com|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/news/tent-city/Content?oid=23601|title=Tent City|first=Michelle|last=Milne|work=portlandmercury.com|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/29/news/mn-18802|title=Homeless Believe It Takes a Village to Raise Dignity|first=KIM|last=MURPHY|date=29 December 2001|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2016|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/05/us/home-for-the-homeless-but-can-it-continue.html|title=Home for the Homeless, But Can It Continue?|date=5 October 2003|work=The New York Times|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
[[File:Jack Tafari.jpg|thumb|widthpx|287px|right|'''Jack Tafari; ''photo by Kevin Brown''''']]

In February 2000, Tafari moved from [[Salem, Oregon]] to [[Portland, Oregon]] after being fired from a job. He was homeless, and he, with others, created [[Dignity Village]] in 2000, as a 'sanctioned tent city' (self governing homeless shelter) in Portland, Oregon.

In December 2000, Tafari was sleeping rough under bridges and in doorways in [[Portland, Oregon]], [[United States]].  There weren’t enough [[homeless shelter|shelter]] spaces for all of Portland's homeless, and Tafari found himself sharing the streets with others. With seven others, Tafari began occupying city properties and pitching tents. "Confronted by [[police]] for their unlicensed use of public land, the initial group of eight men and women had the benefit of a forceful voice in the person of homeless activist Jack Tafari, and the early support of a few local politicians and associated coverage in the local [[News media|media]]. The Portland [[police]] department eventually realized that the group, then calling themselves Camp Dignity, was engaged in complicated Constitutional issues of redress of [[grievance]], and deferred the political issue to the local political authority: The Portland City Council and Mayor".&lt;ref name="Dignity Village"&gt;[[Dignity Village]]&lt;/ref&gt;

While living on Portland's streets, Tafari had become the protector of a sixteen-year-old boy who went by the ‘street name’ of Field Mouse.  Field Mouse had been evicted from a [[hostel]] for runaways for violating [[curfew]].  As his ‘street father’, Tafari helped him to forage for food and protected him from ‘chicken hawks’, or [[sexual predators]].  At a Portland [[public library]], Field Mouse taught Tafari how to use computers and email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.streetroots.org/2009/12/06/brief-history-out-doorways-campaign-part-one|title=A brief history of the Out of the Doorways campaign, part one - Street Roots|work=streetroots.org|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early confrontations with the Portland police, Tafari used his newfound technological prowess to advance his cause by combining [[Internet]] communications and traditional public relations techniques.  To ‘sweep’ Camp Dignity, the police were required to serve twenty-four hours' notice. Tafari started writing [[press release]]s and distributing them by [[email]], using the Internet facilities of the [[Independent Publishing Resource Center]].  His group put their things in shopping carts and, led by their wheelchair cases, they were ‘moved on’ by the police from place to place.  John Reese was appointed as ‘[[Grand Marshal]]’, and as a result of extensive media coverage, their ‘[[shopping cart]] parades’ became internationally celebrated.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The most famous shopping cart parade, which took place on [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]], 2001, included 35 shopping carts and was headed up by a disabled pair in wheelchairs, Grand Marshal John Reese and "Granma Coyote", Jada Mae Langloss.  It attracted nationwide media coverage, and the spectacle of armed policemen herding a group of the indigent made for compelling viewing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

As a consequence of the Martin Luther King Day Parade, Camp Dignity lasted for a space of about six months underneath Portland's [[Fremont Bridge (Portland, Oregon)|Fremont Bridge]]. The Mayor and Council granted the camp the status of a city "pilot project" and offered them a site seven miles from Portland at the Sunderland Recycling Yard. As a negotiating tactic, Tafari distributed another press release headlined "We're Having a Big Parade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dignity.scribble.com/news/index2.html?988228800|title=Dignity: ARTICLES|work=scribble.com|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Faced with the prospect of another highly publicized parade of the indigent, Portland backed down, and allowed the campers two more months at the Fremont Bridge site. Calling off the planned parade, Tafari sent out another press release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dignity.scribble.com/news/index2.html?988664400 "Correkshan"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003122/http://dignity.scribble.com/news/index2.html?988664400 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After protracted negotiations, Camp Dignity accepted Portland's offered site at the Sunderland Recycling Yard.

Throughout the ‘Out of the Doorways Campaign’ years, Tafari was a staff [[writer]] and submissions editor for the Portland street [[newspaper]] [[Street Roots]], and he used this position to publicise his cause among the homeless. The following passage, from an article in the December 2000 issue, is an example of the language Tafari used in his articles to rally Portland's homeless to his cause. He said,

{{cquote|Today we live in a time of [[social]] [[Social change|transformation]]… a new [[information age|informational age]] and a time of economic [[globalization]]. It is a time of social dislocation. Today the [[economy]] is booming and so is the [[home]]less [[population]]. What we see around us now in the [[downtown]] core of our [[cities]] is homeless people wall-to-wall. Many of the [[Employment|jobs]] that paid anything have gone south or elsewhere or are now done by [[machine]]. Today the [[cost]] of space in our cities to live in is climbing beyond the reach of many [[low-income]] [[people]]. And today homeless people are harried and harassed, run from here to there, [[tax]]ed by [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s, commodified and used as a [[resource (economics)|resource]], sometimes brutalized, occasionally felonized and often used as [[slave labour]] by the [[prison]] [[industry]]. You know what they say: the good can't rest and the wicked never sleep. Not, of course, that ev'ry one of we is good. But we are [[human being]]s and we do not deserve the treatment we receive at the hands of wicked men.

Very soon now we shall pitch the tents of [[Joshua]] on various sites around the city. We are blessed here in [[Oregon]] with ample [[public land]] and so there is [[space]] if not a place for us to go. We must build that place for ourselves. Know that the kernel of the [[future]] lies buried in the present. It is important for the future how we set up and [[governance|govern]] our camps now. We have many [[friendship|friends]]. There are those who would fight against we, workers of iniquity who [[profit (economics)|profit]] from our situation and would rather things remain the way they are. It is time to be of good [[courage]], [[brother]]s and [[sister]]s. We may wander for a [[time]] in the [[wilderness]]. But as surely as [[night]] follows [[day]], one day we shall reach a [[Gaddi (Bible)|land flowing with milk and honey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dignity.scribble.com/articles/future.html|title=The Future |website=dignity.scribble.com|author=Jack Tafari|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Dignity Village]], a homeless camp incorporated in [[Portland, Oregon]] as a [[501(c)(3)]] membership-based non-profit organization, is set up as a self-governing entity, and "residents" are bound by five rules of behaviour, contained in their membership agreement.&lt;ref name="Dignity Village"/&gt; Tafari was chairman of Dignity Village Inc. from 2002 until 2005.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The community has generated considerable international interest as a possible means of ameliorating the problem of developed world homelessness.  In 2004, Tafari was invited to London to address the Crisis Innovations Fair on the subject of homelessness and possible solutions.  He shared the podium with Dr. Michael Woolcock, [[authority|senior]] [[social science|social scientist]] with the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crisis.org.uk/data/files/policy_research/events/2004conferencereport.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20100218230739/http://www.crisis.org.uk/data/files/policy_research/events/2004conferencereport.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 February 2010|title=Homelessness and Loneliness: Building Social Capital in the twenty-first Century {{hyphen}} Conference Report: Crisis Innovations Fair|publisher= ngo.media |author=Emma Meyer|date = October 19, 2004|website=crisis.org.uk|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dignity Village has been featured in articles in London's [[The Guardian]], in [[The New York Times]],&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', "Home for the Homeless, But Can It Continue?" 5 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and in other [[publication]]s and [[electronic media|media]]. ''[[The LA Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.is.asu.edu/pipermail/hpn/2001-December/005223.html "Homeless Believe It Takes a Village to Raise Dignity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814011952/http://projects.is.asu.edu/pipermail/hpn/2001-December/005223.html |date=14 August 2007 }} 29 December 2001&lt;/ref&gt; captured Tafari's vision for Dignity Village in a whimsical, [[idyll]]ic [[quotation]]. "Essentially, we will create housing for ourselves....The housing will be [[solar-power]]ed, wind-driven. We'll eat from our [[garden]], on our own table, and rest under our own [[ficus|fig]] [[tree]]s when our [[manual labour|labor]]s are done."

Dignity Village, founded in 2001, today (in 2016) also serves as a widely emulated [[prototype]] for the [[tiny house]]s for the homeless movement:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/01/oregon-tiny-houses-solution-homelessness|title=Can Oregon's tiny houses be part of the solution to homelessness?|first=Jason|last=Wilson|date=1 April 2015|work=theguardian.com|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an example, Opportunity Village&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.squareonevillages.org/|title=SquareOne Villages|work=squareonevillages.org|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Eugene Oregon]].

In 2005 Tafari was diagnosed with [[hepatitis C]]. As he was poor he had no US [[health insurance]], and was therefore unable to have his condition treated. He was also however, a [[UK citizen]]. He resigned his position as CEO of Dignity Village and returned to London to receive [[medical treatment]] under the English [[National Health Service]] (NHS). Homeless at first, he took advantage of English [[squatting]] laws to secure temporary housing for himself and sometimes others. These laws, which originated in the [[middle ages]], allowed for unoccupied buildings to be taken over as temporary housing by those in need. During this period Tafari honed his squatting skills in three areas: the ‘scouting’ of suitable squats; ‘cracking’ squats (gaining entry); and ‘legally filing’ (registering) squats, such that property owners would have to go to court to secure evictions by means of interim possession orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/property/homeowners_should_have_right_to_kick_out_squatters_1_794800?usurv=skip|title=Homeowners should have right to kick out squatters|first=Sanchez|last=Manning|work=edp24.co.uk|accessdate=4 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625134037/http://www.edp24.co.uk/property/homeowners_should_have_right_to_kick_out_squatters_1_794800?usurv=skip|archivedate=25 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Tafari secured housing for himself when he was awarded a council flat on a [[Peabody Trust]] estate in [[Islington]], north London. Now a British [[pensioner]], and with his hepatitis C in remission, he had a secure base from which to continue his activism. He therefore set out to reconfigure his housing for the homeless strategy to suit the English legal and institutional landscape. With a small network of co activists, he began scouting, cracking and legally registering squats as temporary housing for homeless people, sometimes working informally with organisations such as the Advisory Service for Squatters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.squatter.org.uk/|title=Advisory Service for Squatters - Legal &amp; practical advice for squatters and other homeless people|work=squatter.org.uk|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, 2012, squatting residential properties became a [[criminal offence]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/squatting-new-criminal-offence|title=Squatting - new criminal offence - News stories - GOV.UK|work=www.gov.uk|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tafari nevertheless continued to advocate for housing rights for homeless people, for example by forcefully opposing the sale to private developers of London's dwindling stock of [[council housing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camdennewjournal.com/news/2013/jul/investigation-launched-how-town-hall-sold-council-home-without-housing-chiefs-realisin|title=Investigation launched into how Town Hall sold off council home without housing chiefs realising - Camden New Journal|work=camdennewjournal.com|accessdate=4 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701053122/http://www.camdennewjournal.com/news/2013/jul/investigation-launched-how-town-hall-sold-council-home-without-housing-chiefs-realisin|archivedate=1 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death in Africa==

In January 2016, Tafari was diagnosed in London with inoperable [[liver cancer]].  With help from a group of friends, he achieved his bucket list wish to revisit Africa, where he had travelled in 2010 in the company of his friend Leland Larson, philanthropist, of the Oregon-based Larson Legacy. He left London in the company of another close friend, Maira Fenci, travelling first to Casablanca, and from thence to Accra, Ghana. He died on April 20 at the 37 Military Hospital in Accra of liver failure, and is buried in Akuma Village on the outskirts of Accra.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; His wake and burial were performed in accordance with blended Ghanaian and Rastafari [[funeral rites]], and included crowds of guests from Accra's Rastafari community.

'''Joseph "Joe" Kahahawai Jr.''' (25 December 1909 – 8 January 1932) was a [[Native Hawaiian]] prizefighter accused of the rape of [[Thalia Massie]]. He was abducted and killed after he was freed following an inconclusive court case that ended with a [[hung jury]] mistrial.&lt;ref name="Stannard1"&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Stannard |authorlink=David Stannard |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2001/Oct/14/op/op03a.html |title=The Massie case: Injustice and courage |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |work=[[The Honolulu Advertiser]] |publisher=[[Black Press]] |date=2001-10-14 |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/massie/massiechronology.html|title=The Massie Trials: A Chronology|last=Linder|first=Douglas O.|authorlink=Douglas O.

==Early life==
Joseph Kahahawai was born in rural [[Maui]], 25 December 1909. His family moved to [[Honolulu]] and Kahahawai′s parents divorced. He lived with his mother, who later remarried, while Kahahawai remained in contact with his father. After elementary school, Kahahawai attended [[Saint Louis School]] through an athletic scholarship to play for the high school football team, building up a positive reputation. Due to the [[Great Depression]], Kahahawai never graduated and worked various jobs. He also enlisted in the [[Hawaii Army National Guard|Territorial National Guard]]. As a [[Boxing|boxer]], Kahahawai fought both professionally under the name '''Joe Kalani''' and as a member of the 298th Infantry Regiment.&lt;ref name="Stannard2"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Stannard |authorlink=David Stannard |title=Honor killing |year=2006 |origyear=2005 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=New York, NY, USA |isbn=9781440649219 |id={{OCLC|759838997|648096412|645891754}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99}}

==Accusation of rape and subsequent trial==
{{Main|Massie Trial}}

==Abduction and murder==
With a [[hung jury]] &amp;ndash; stymied by conflicting evidence &amp;ndash; resulting in a mistrial, Kahahawai was kidnapped by Thalia Massie's mother and husband, [[Grace Fortescue]] and Navy Lieutenant Thomas Massie respectively, and two Navy enlisted men, Albert O. Jones and Edward J. Lord.&lt;ref name="Stannard1"/&gt; While Thomas Massie was questioning him in an attempt to force a rape confession, Kahahawai reportedly lunged at Massie, and Jones shot him.&lt;ref name="Life"&gt;{{cite journal |date=1966-10-07 |title=...A Sailor Confesses to Old Hawaii Killing |journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |volume=61 |issue=15 |page=49 |pages= |at= |chapter= |location=Chicago |publisher=[[Time Inc]] |issn=0024-3019 |oclc=561728384 |accessdate=2013-03-23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jFYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22An+older+and+much+better-kept+secret+is+broken%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RklOUaq_K43wigKi0YCoDg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22An%20older%20and%20much%20better-kept%20secret%20is%20broken%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Puea.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Joseph Kahahawai Jr., at Puea Cemetery in [[Kalihi]], [[Honolulu]] ]]

Massie, Fortescue, Jones and Lord were charged with murder. The jury found them guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter, and they were each sentenced to 10 years in prison.  The white population, heavily weighted by the American citizens of [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor]] and the businesses supporting it, was enraged. Under pressure from [[Rear Admiral]] [[Yates Stirling, Jr.]], Commandant of the US Navy's 14th Naval District (including N.S. Pearl Harbor), and following threats that martial law might be imposed if the sentences were allowed to stand, Territorial Governor [[Lawrence M. Judd]] commuted the 10-year sentences of the convicted killers to one hour, to be served in his office.&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt;  The four convicted killers left Hawaii just days after sitting through their one hour sentence preventing the retrial of the four surviving defendants in the Massie rape case.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16361">'''Juana Gertrudis Navarro Alsbury''' (1812 – July 23, 1888) was one of the few [[List of Texan survivors of the Battle of the Alamo|Texian survivors of the Battle of the Alamo]] during the [[Texas Revolution]] in 1836.  As Mexican forces entered her hometown, [[San Antonio de Bexar]], on February 23, Alsbury's cousin by marriage, [[James Bowie]], brought her with him to the [[Alamo Mission]] so that he could protect her.  Bowie, the co-commander of the [[Texian]] forces, collapsed from illness on the second day of the siege; Alsbury nursed him throughout the remainder of the siege. On March 4, Texian co-commander [[William Barret Travis]] sent her as an emissary to Mexican commander [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]] to negotiate an honorable surrender for the Texian forces.  She made no headway, and her visit likely increased Santa Anna's impatience to end the siege in a spectacular fashion.  Santa Anna launched an early-morning assault on the Alamo on March 6.

Most Texian troops were killed during the [[Battle of the Alamo]].  Two of them died in front of Alsbury.  One Texian was killed trying to protect Alsbury, her sister Gertrudis, and her young son [[Alijo Perez Jr.]], from Mexican troops.  The other was found hiding in her room.  The women were rescued by a Mexican officer and interviewed by Santa Anna before being released.

Alsbury belonged to a prominent family within San Antonio de Bexar and was raised by her uncle [[Juan Martin de Veramendi]], who briefly served as governor of Texas.  She married three times.  Her first husband died of cholera; the second, Dr. [[Horace Alsbury]], was captured by Mexican forces during the [[Mexican-American War]]; after his death, she married a cousin of her first husband.

==Early years==
Juana Gertrudis Navarro was born in San Antonio de Béxar (modern [[San Antonio, Texas]]) to [[José Ángel Navarro (elder)|José Ángel Navarro]] and Concepción Cervantes.  Her exact birthdate was unrecorded, but she was baptized on December 28, 1812.&lt;ref name=ragsdale&gt;{{citation|last=Ragsdale|first=Crystal Sasse|title=Juana Gertrudis Navarro Alsbury|work=Handbook of Texas|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fal49|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Navarro family was well known in Béxar; both Juana's father and his brother, [[José Antonio Navarro]], held prominent positions in local government.&lt;ref name=chartier18&gt;Chartier and Enss (2004), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Juana was about 17 when her mother died on January 30, 1830. Juana's father remarried almost a year later in January 1831. She and her younger sister Gertrudis were adopted by their father's sister, Josefa Navarro, who was married to [[Juan Martín de Veramendi]].&lt;ref name=chartier18/&gt;  The Navarro girls considered their cousin Ursula another sister.&lt;ref name=guerra137&gt;Guerra (2012), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Veramendi served as governor of [[Coahuila y Tejas]] from 1832–1833.  Although Juana spoke little English,&lt;ref name=chartier19&gt;Chartier and Enss (2004), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; she and her family socialized with the prominent Anglo families in Béxar, including [[Samuel Maverick|Samuel]] and [[Mary Maverick]].&lt;ref name=guerra128&gt;Guerra (2012), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832, Juana married Alejo Pérez Ramigio,&lt;ref name=ragsdale/&gt; a relative of the [[Martín De León|De León]] family which had founded [[Victoria, Texas]]. Pérez was a merchant, with a license to transport goods to and from [[Monclova, Mexico|Monclova]]&lt;ref name=guerra137/&gt;  The couple had one son, [[Alijo Perez Jr.]], and may have had a daughter who died in infancy.&lt;ref name=ragsdale/&gt;

Juana's adoptive parents and her cousin Ursula died in a [[cholera]] epidemic in Monclova in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her husband died of the same disease in either 1834&lt;ref name=ragsdale/&gt; or 1835.&lt;ref name=guerra137/&gt;

==Texas Revolution==
In the early to mid-1830s, the political situation in Mexico underwent much upheaval.  [[Federalism|Federalists]] wished to delegate many powers to the individual Mexican states, while [[centralized government|centralists]] wished to consolidate power at the national level. In 1835, several interior Mexican states, angry at the increasingly dictatorial policies of Mexican President [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], took up arms against the Mexican government.&lt;ref name=todish6&gt;Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Texian]]s launched their own armed rebellion, known as the [[Texas Revolution]], in October 1835.  Over the next two months, Texians successfully removed all Mexican troops from the region.  Their actions infuriated Mexican president [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]], who immediately began preparations to invade Texas.&lt;ref name=hardin98&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;   Most of the Navarro family supported the Texian cause.  An exception was Juana's father, who joined Santa Anna's new Army of Operations in Texas as an officer.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;  Although he remained loyal to Mexico, José Ángel Navarro had been very vocal in his disagreement with Santa Anna's overthrow of the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]].&lt;ref name=chartier14&gt;Chartier and Enss (2004), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1836, Juana married again, to Dr. [[Horace Alsbury]].&lt;ref name=williams&gt;{{citation|last=Williams|first=Amelia|title=Texas Collection|journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|volume=49|issue=4|date=April 1946|url=
http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth146056/m1/722/?q=juana navarro|page=635–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple had known each other for some time; Alsbury had many meetings in Béxar with [[James Bowie]], the widower of Juana's cousin Ursula.&lt;ref name=chartier18/&gt;  Alsbury was a Texian spy, gathering information about the Mexican army.&lt;ref name=chartier19/&gt;

[[File:Jimbowie.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Bowie]] escorted Juana and her family into the [[Alamo Mission]] for safety.]]
Rumors soon flew that Santa Anna and his army were coming directly toward Béxar, location of the [[Alamo Mission]], one of two Texian garrisons.  Many local residents fled the town.  On February 23, Horace Alsbury left for East Texas, either to find a safe place to bring his wife, her son, and her sister Gertrudis,&lt;ref name=ragsdale/&gt;&lt;ref name=williams/&gt; or to gather reinforcements for the undermanned Texian garrison.&lt;ref name=chartier14and15&gt;Chartiers and Enss (2004), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alsbury left his family with Bowie, a colonel in the Texian militia.&lt;ref name=ragsdale/&gt;&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;

Later that afternoon, the vanguard of Santa Anna's army arrived.  Bowie moved the women and children into the Alamo.&lt;ref name=ragsdale/&gt;  The women and child were given a room in "the northwest corner of the fort", near the quarters of Texian commanders Bowie and [[William Barret Travis]].&lt;ref name=chartier19/&gt; By the end of the day, more than 1,500 Mexican troops had entered Bexar and initiated a [[siege of the Alamo]].&lt;ref name=todish40&gt;Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point on the second day of the siege, Bowie collapsed from illness.  He was confined to his bed and Juana acted as his nurse.&lt;ref name=hopewell117&gt;Hopewell (1994), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the siege, the Mexican army kept up a continual bombardment, while the Texians were forced to conserve their ammunition and rarely respond.&lt;ref name=hardin132&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conditions were difficult for the women and children in the fort.  There was little food, and the constant noise made it difficult to sleep.&lt;ref name=chartier19/&gt;

On March 3, an additional 1,000 Mexican soldiers arrived in Bexar.&lt;ref name=todish47&gt;Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Texians were vastly outnumbered, although between 32 and 80 additional men were able to break through Mexican lines to join them in the Alamo, bringing Texian numbers to approximately 250.&lt;ref name=lindley138to142&gt;Lindley (2003), pp. 138–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following evening (March 4), Travis sent Juana to negotiate an honorable surrender for the [[list of Alamo defenders|Alamo defenders]].  Fellow survivor [[Susanna Dickinson]] misinterpreted Juana's mission and, years later, accused her of deserting the Texians to provide information about their defenses to her father, who served on Santa Anna's staff.&lt;ref name=edmondson355&gt;Edmondson (2000), p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians place no credence in the theory that Juana spied for the Mexican army, but acknowledge that her visit likely increased Santa Anna's impatience to end the siege. As historian Timothy Todish noted, "there would have been little glory in a bloodless victory".&lt;ref name=todish49&gt;Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  The following morning, Santa Anna announced to his staff that the assault would take place early on March 6.&lt;ref name=todish49/&gt;

The Mexican army attacked the Alamo just before 6:00 am on March 6.&lt;ref name=edmondson362&gt;Edmondson (2000), p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; During the battle, Juana and her son and sister hid in one of the rooms along the west wall.&lt;ref name=todish54/&gt;  Juana dressed her son as a girl "in the hope that Mexican troops would not harm him".&lt;ref name=chartier18/&gt;  As the battle approached their rooms,  Gertrudis Navarro opened the door to signal that they meant no harm.&lt;ref name=todish54&gt;Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; When Mexican soldiers threatened them, a Texian defender&lt;ref group=Note&gt;According to Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 54, the Texian defender was either Edwin Mitchell or Napoleon Mitchell; Alsbury knew only his last name.&lt;/ref&gt; charged into the room to defend them; he was quickly killed, as was a young Tejano who took refuge in the room.&lt;ref name=todish54/&gt; Soldiers rifled through Juana's trunk and confiscated most of its contents, including her clothing, coins, jewelry, and even "the watches that Travis and other officers had given her for safekeeping."&lt;ref name=chartier21&gt;Chartier and Enss (2004), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Mexican officer entered the room and forbade the soldiers from harming the women and child.&lt;ref name=chartiers22&gt;Chartiers and Enss (2004), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; When the battle ended, almost all of the Texians were dead.&lt;ref name=todish55/&gt;  Seven women and seven children survived.&lt;ref name=guerra123&gt;Guerra (2012), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Juana and her family were escorted out of the Alamo by her former brother-in-law, Manuel Pérez, who was a soldier in Santa Anna's army.  Pérez took them to the home of her father.&lt;ref name=chartiers22/&gt;

Santa Anna personally interviewed each surviving noncombatant on March 7.  He was most impressed with Dickinson, and offered to adopt her young daughter and educate the child in Mexico City.  No similar offer was extended to Juana, whose son was approximately the same age.&lt;ref name=todish55&gt;Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each woman was given a blanket and two silver [[peso]]s.&lt;ref name=petite127&gt;Petite (1998), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;  The survivors requested permission to find the bodies of their loved ones and give them a proper burial, but were denied by Santa Anna.&lt;ref name=guerra129&gt;Guerra (2012), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Juana and her sister were in an awkward situation.  Many Anglos in Béxar considered all Mexicans traitors to the Texas Revolution.  Many of those in Béxar still loyal to Mexico considered Juana and her sister traitors for being in the Alamo.&lt;ref name=guerra129/&gt;  The Texas Revolution ended in April 1836, when the Texian army captured Santa Anna at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]].  Juana's father died several months later, leaving each of his daughter 25 head of cattle.&lt;ref name=guerra137/&gt;

==Later years==
Following the war, the Alsburys moved to Calaveras Ranch, property her family had long owned along the road to [[Goliad, Texas|Goliad]].&lt;ref name=guerra138&gt;Guerra (2012), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;   The Mexican government refused to recognize the new [[Republic of Texas]].  In September 1842, Mexican general [[Adrian Woll]] invaded Texas and captured Béxar.  He arrested several dozen Texians, including Horace Alsbury, and marched them into Mexico.  Juana followed as far as [[Candela, Coahuila]].  She waited there for almost two years, until Horace Alsbury was released in 1844.  The couple returned to Texas.&lt;ref name=ragsdale/&gt;  Horace Alsbury then joined troops fighting the [[Mexican-American War]].  He died while in the army in 1846&lt;ref name=chartier23&gt;Chartier and Enss (2004), p .23.&lt;/ref&gt; or 1847.&lt;ref name=ragsdale/&gt;  At some point after this, Juana married again, to Juan Pérez, her first husband's cousin.&lt;ref name=ragsdale/&gt;

In 1857 Juana petitioned the legislature of the [[State of Texas]] for one of the pensions available to people who had served in the Texas Revolution. For her service as a nurse to Bowie, her request was granted.&lt;ref name=ragsdale/&gt;

Juana died on July 23, 1888 at her son's home along [[Salado Creek]] in [[Bexar County, Texas]].  She was either buried there or at a Catholic cemetery within San Antonio.&lt;ref name=ragsdale/&gt;

==Legacy==
For many decades, published accounts of the Battle of the Alamo listed only two survivors, Susannah Dickinson and her daughter Angelina, "the Babe of the Alamo".&lt;ref name=guerra124/&gt;

In the late 1880s Juana was interviewed by her friend [[Mary Maverick]] and historian [[John S. Ford]] about her recollections of the Battle of the Alamo.&lt;ref name=guerra124&gt;Guerra (2012), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;  The interview took place over 50 years after the battle, and the resulting synopsis was written in the "romantic post-Civil War language of hyperbole that was fashionable in the 1880s".&lt;ref name=guerra125&gt;Guerra (2012), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;  As one of only three accounts by Texian survivors, Juana's interview is "among the most relied upon sources about these non-combatant women and children."&lt;ref name=guerra126&gt;Guerra (2012), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;  The interview was not published until 1995, when it appeared in historian Timothy Matovina's book ''The Alamo Remembered: Tejano Accounts and Perspectives''.&lt;ref&gt;Matovina (1995), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kaspar Kornelius Mortaigne de Potelles''' (1609 – 10 July 1647 [[Sankt Goar]]) was a [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[General-Lieutenant]] who fought during the course of the Thirty Years' and Hessian Wars.

==Biography==
Mortaigne was born in 1609, to a Flemish Lutheran family. Mortaigne became a [[squire]] of Prince Philipp, son of [[Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]], while he was pursuing a military education in the [[Netherlands]]. On 17 August 1626, Philipp was killed while fighting for the Protestant side at the Battle of Lutter. Following his master's death Mortaigne entered the service of [[Sweden]], becoming colonel in 1637. The course of the Swedish intervention into the Thirty Years' War was abruptly interrupted in the aftermath of the 10 May 1641 death of  [[Johan Banér]], the commander of the Swedish expeditionary force.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|pp=626–629, 970}}{{sfn|Poten|1885|pp=339–340}}

Mortaigne became a leader of a large scale mutiny which paralyzed the Swedish army, demanding the immediate payment of their arrears. In July 1641, Mortaigne and [[Adam von Pfuhl]] were invited into [[Stockholm]] as representative of the mutineers. Mortaigne was promoted into [[brigadier general]] and received land in [[Pomerania]], while the rest of the army was paid the sum of 486,200 [[thaler]]s settling the crown's debts. During the course of 1642, Mortaigne took part in the [[Battle of Breitenfeld (1642)|second Battle of Breitenfeld]] and was later severely injured during an engagement in the vicinity of [[Brzeg|Brieg]]. In 1643, Mortaigne's forces ravaged through [[Moravia]]. On 12 February 1645, he was captured by an [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] patrol outside [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] while carrying a portfolio of important documents. He was released on ransom, later commanding the Swedish center at the [[Battle of Jankau]]. In 1646, he returned to the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel]] with the approval of [[Christina, Queen of Sweden]], receiving the rank of [[general-lieutenant]]. He led Hesse-Kassel's troops during the [[Hessian War]]. On 10 July 1647, a cannonball crushed his left leg, gravely wounding him  while  he was besieging the  [[Rheinfels Castle]].{{sfn|Wilson|2011|pp=626–629, 970}}{{sfn|Poten|1885|pp=339–340}}

The '''Kickapoo People''' ([[Kickapoo people#Language|Kickapoo]]: '''''Kiikaapoa''''' or '''''Kiikaapoi''''') are an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[Indigenous Mexican]] [[tribe]]. ''[[Anishinaabe]]g'' say the name "Kickapoo" (''Giiwigaabaw'' in the [[Ojibwe language|Anishinaabe language]] and its [[Kickapoo language|Kickapoo]] cognate ''Kiwikapawa'') means "Stands here and there," which may have referred to the tribe's migratory patterns.  The name can also mean "wanderer".  This interpretation is contested and generally believed to be a [[folk etymology]].

Today there are three [[Federally recognized tribe|federally recognized]] Kickapoo tribes in the [[United States]]: [[Kickapoo Tribe of Indians of the Kickapoo Reservation in Kansas]], the [[Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma]], and the [[Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas]]. The Oklahoma and Texas bands are politically associated with each other. The Kickapoo in Kansas came from a relocation from southern Missouri in 1832 as a land exchange from their reserve there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tolatsga.org/kick.html KICKAPOO HISTORY]&lt;/ref&gt; Around 3,000 people are enrolled tribal members. Another band, the [[Mexican Kickapoo|Tribu Kikapú]], resides in [[Múzquiz Municipality]] in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Coahuila]]. Smaller bands live in [[Sonora]] and [[Durango]].

== History ==
[[File:Kickapoo, Babe Shkit, Chief and Delegate from Oklahoma - NARA - 523854.tif|Babe Shkit, Kickapoo chief and delegate from Indian Territory, ca. 1900|thumb|left]]

The Kickapoo were an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian-language]] people who likely migrated to or developed as a people in a large territory along the [[Wabash River]] in the area of modern [[Terre Haute, Indiana]]. They were confederated with the larger [[Wabash Confederacy]], which included the [[Piankeshaw]] to their south, the [[Wea]] to their north, and the powerful [[Miami Tribe]], to their east. A subgroup occupied the [[Upper Iowa River]] region in what was later known as northeast [[Iowa]] and the [[Root River (Minnesota)|Root River]] region in southeast [[Minnesota]] in the late 1600s and early 1700s. This group was probably known by the clan name "Mahouea", derived from the Illinoian word for wolf, ''m'hwea''.&lt;ref name=betts&gt;{{cite web|last=Colin M. |first=Betts |title=Rediscovering the Mahouea |work=Journal of the [[Iowa Archeological Society]] 58:23-33 |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/focus/publications/ias/jiasbycounty.htm |accessdate=January 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119071947/http://www.uiowa.edu/~osa/focus/publications/ias/jiasbycounty.htm |archivedate=November 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest European contact with the Kickapoo tribe occurred during the [[La Salle Expeditions]] into [[Illinois Country]] in the late 17th century. The French colonists set up remote [[fur trading]] posts throughout the region, including on the [[Wabash River]]. They typically would set up posts at or near Native American villages, and Terre Haute was founded as a French village. The Kickapoo had to contend with a changing cast of Europeans; the British defeated the French in the [[Seven Years' War]] and took over nominal rule of this area after 1763. They increased their own trading with the Kickapoo.

The United States acquired this territory east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River after it gained independence from the United Kingdom. As white settlers moved into the region from the United States eastern areas, beginning in the early 19th century, the Kickapoo were under pressure. They negotiated with the United States over their territory in several treaties, including the [[Treaty of Vincennes]], the [[Treaty of Grouseland]], and the [[Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809)|Treaty of Fort Wayne]]. They sold most of their lands to the United States and moved north to settle among the Wea.

Rising tensions between the regional tribes and the United States led to [[Tecumseh's War]] in 1811. The Kickapoo were one of Tecumseh's closest allies. Many Kickapoo warriors participated in the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] and the subsequent [[Indiana in the War of 1812|War of 1812]] on the side of the British, hoping to expel the American settlers from the region. A prominent, nonviolent spiritual leader among the Kickapoo was [[Kennekuk]], who led his followers during [[Indian Removal]] in the 1830s to their current tribal lands in Kansas. He died there in 1852.

The close of the war led to a change of federal Indian policy in the [[Indiana Territory]], and later the state of [[Indiana]]. American leaders began to advocate the [[Indian removals in Indiana|removal of tribes]] to lands west of the [[Mississippi River]], to extinguish their claims to lands wanted by American settlers.  The Kickapoo were among the first tribes to leave Indiana under this program.  They accepted land in [[Kansas]] and an annual subsidy in exchange for leaving the state.

[[File:Grupo Kikapú en Coahuila México.jpg|thumb|300px|Kickapoo people building a Winter House in the town of Nacimiento Coahuila, México, 2008]]
Kickapoo speak an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language closely related to that of the [[Fox language|Sauk and Fox]].  They are classified with the Central Algonquians, and are also related to the [[Illinois Confederation]].

In 1985 the Kickapoo Nation's School in [[Horton, Kansas]] began a language immersion program for elementary school grades to revive teaching and use of the Kickapoo language in grades K-6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2010, the Head Start Program at the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas (KTTT) reservation, which teaches the Kickapoo language, became "the first Native American school to earn Texas School Ready!

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2010, Mexico's "[[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia]] (INAH) participated in the elaboration of a Kickapoo alphabet that may be used by more than 700 members of the group that dwell in Mexico and the United States, in the states of Coahuila and Texas. Previously no Kickapoo alphabet was used in Mexico; although there is a syllabic writing system it has no element ordination, organization or classification method."&lt;ref&gt;

The Kickapoo language and members of the Kickapoo tribe were featured in the movie ''[[The Only Good Indian]]'' (2009), directed by Greg Wilmott and starring [[Wes Studi]]. This was a fictionalized account of Native American children forced to attend an Indian boarding school, where they were forced to speak English and give up their cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Tribes and communities==
There are three federally recognized Kickapoo communities in the United States: one in Kansas, one in Texas, and the third in Oklahoma. The [[Mexican Kickapoo]] are closely tied to the Texas and Oklahoma communities.  These groups migrate annually among the three locations to maintain connections. Indeed, the Texas and Mexican branch are the same cross-border nation, called Kickapoo of Coahuila/Texas &lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|last1=Mager|first1=Elisabeth|title=The Kickapoo Of Coahuila/Texas Cultural Implications Of Being A Cross-Border Nation|journal=Voices of Mexico|date=2011|issue=90|pages=36-40|url=http://www.revistascisan.unam.mx/Voices/pdfs/9008.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kickapoo Indian Reservation of Kansas ===
The [[Kickapoo Indian Reservation of Kansas]] is located at {{coord|39|40|51|N|95|36|41|W|scale:250000}} in the northeastern part of the state in parts of three counties: [[Brown County, Kansas|Brown]], [[Jackson County, Kansas|Jackson]], and [[Atchison County, Kansas|Atchison]]. It has a land area of {{convert|612.203|km2|sqmi}} and a resident population of 4,419 as of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]]. The largest community on the reservation is the city of [[Horton, Kansas|Horton]]. The other communities are:

*[[Netawaka, Kansas|Netawaka]] 
*[[Powhattan, Kansas|Powhattan]]
*[[Whiting, Kansas|Whiting]]
*[[Willis, Kansas|Willis]]
{{div col end}}

===Kickapoo Indian Reservation of Texas===
The [[Kickapoo Indian Reservation of Texas]] is located at {{coord|28|36|37|N|100|26|19|W|scale:100000}} on the [[Rio Grande]] on the [[U.S.-Mexico border]] in western [[Maverick County, Texas|Maverick County]], just south of the city of [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]], as part of the community of [[Rosita South, Texas|Rosita South]]. It has a land area of {{convert|0.4799|km2|acre}} and a 2000 census population of 420 persons. The Texas Indian Commission officially recognized the tribe in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Tom. ''On the Border: Portraits of America's Southwestern Frontier'', pp. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Kickapoo in Maverick County, Texas, constitute the "South Texas Subgroup of the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma". That band owns {{convert|917.79|acre|km2}} of non-reservation land in Maverick County, primarily to the north of Eagle Pass. It has an office in that city.&lt;ref&gt;Maverick County Appraisal District property tax appraisals, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma ===
[[File:Kickapoo wickiup.jpg|thumb|A Kickapoo [[Wigwam|wickiup]], [[Sac and Fox Nation|Sac and Fox Agency]], Oklahoma, ca. 1880.]]
After being expelled from the [[Republic of Texas]], many Kickapoo moved south to [[Mexico]], but the population of two villages settled in [[Indian Territory]]. One village settled within the [[Chickasaw Nation]] and the other within the [[Creek (people)|Muscogee Creek Nation]]. These Kickapoo were granted their own reservation in 1883 and became recognized as the [[Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma]].

The reservation was short-lived. In 1893 under the Dawes Act, their communal tribal lands were broken up&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and assigned to separate member households by allotments.  The tribe's government was dismantled by the [[Curtis Act of 1898]], which encouraged assimilation by Native Americans to the majority culture. Tribal members struggled under these conditions.

In the 1930s the federal and state governments encouraged tribes to reorganize their governments. This one formed the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma in 1936, under the [[Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act]].&lt;ref name="ohs"&gt;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/K/KI004.html Annette Kuhlman, "Kickapoo"], ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History &amp; Culture'', Oklahoma Historical Society, 2009 (accessed 21 February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma is headquartered in [[McLoud, Oklahoma]].  Their tribal jurisdictional area is in [[Oklahoma County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma]], [[Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma|Pottawatomie]], and [[Lincoln County, Oklahoma|Lincoln]] counties. They have 2,719 enrolled tribal members.&lt;ref name=OIA&gt;Oklahoma Indian Affairs.

'''Lord Uxbridge's leg''' was probably shattered by a piece of case shot at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and removed by a surgeon.&lt;ref name=USM&gt;''Leaves from a Soldier's Notebook'', in ''Colborn's United Service Magazine and Naval and Military Journal'' for 1847, Part II (London, H. Hurst, 1847) p. 543&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Anglesey, ‘'Paget , Henry William, first marquess of Anglesey (1768–1854)’', [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21112, accessed 10 Oct 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The amputated right limb became a tourist attraction in the village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] in Belgium, where it had been removed and interred.&lt;ref&gt;Material on which this article is based can be found in the ''[http://www.bbchistorymagazine.com/ BBC History Magazine]'', vol. 3, no. 6, June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waterloo==
[[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Henry Paget, 2nd Earl of Uxbridge]], later the 1st [[Marquess of Anglesey]], commanded 13,000 Allied cavalry and 44 guns of the [[horse artillery]] at the Battle of Waterloo.  At about 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm, at a critical stage in the battle, he led a charge of the 2,000 [[heavy cavalry]] of the [[Household Brigade]] and the Union Brigade to throw back the columns of [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|D'Erlon]]'s French I Corps, who were threatening to push back [[Thomas Picton|Picton]]'s severely outnumbered 5th Division, with some 15,000 French infantry advancing on 3,000 British and Dutch-Belgian troops.  The charge succeeded in sweeping the French infantry away in disorder, but Uxbridge was unable to rally his troops, who ran on in pursuit and were cut up by counter-attacking French cavalry. Uxbridge spent the rest of the battle leading a series of charges by British [[light cavalry]] formations, and had eight or nine horses shot from under him.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

One of the last cannon shots fired on 18 June 1815 hit his right leg, necessitating its [[amputation]] above the knee.&lt;ref&gt;Contemporaneous sources: ( For example: Edward Baines, ''History of the Wars of the French Revolution, from the Breaking Out of the War, in 1792, to the Restoration of a General Peace in 1815: Comprehending the Civil History of Great Britain and France, During that Period'', Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, 1818. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GMxLAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA467#PPA468,M1 p. 468] &amp;
George Jones, John Booth, ''The Battle of Waterloo: With Those of Ligny and Quatre Bras, Described by Eye-witnesses and by the Series of Official Accounts Published by Authority. ...'', Published by L. Booth, 1852. [https://books.google.com/books?id=k4dJAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA403&amp;dq=waterloo+Uxbridge+left+leg+surgeon p. 403]) say right leg; some more recent sources say the left.&lt;/ref&gt; According to anecdote, which is probably apocryphal, he was close to the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] when his leg was hit, and exclaimed, "By God, sir, I've lost my leg!", to which Wellington replied "By God, sir, so you have!"&lt;ref&gt;Anglesey, ‘Paget , Henry William, first marquess of Anglesey (1768–1854)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Oct 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21112, accessed 13 Nov 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Geoffrey. Military Anecdotes (1992) p. 34 Guinness Publishing {{ISBN|0-85112-519-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps a more authentic version of this exchange comes from the diary of J. W. Croker, a friend of Wellington, written on 8 December
1818, in which he recounts a conversation with Horace Seymour, the man who carried the wounded Uxbridge from the battlefield. Seymour recalled that when Uxbridge was shot he cried out, "I have got it at last," to which the Duke of Wellington responded, "No? Have you, by God?".&lt;ref&gt; waterloo200.org/wp-content/uploads/.../Wellington_and_Uxbridge.pdf, accessed 8 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amputation==
After being wounded, Lord Uxbridge was taken to his headquarters in the village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], a house owned by M. Hyacinthe Joseph-Marie Paris, Maison Tremblant, who was still in his residence at 214, Chaussée de Bruxelles.&lt;ref&gt;The house was demolished in the twentieth century ([http://www.napoleonic-literature.com/Waterloo/Water-1.html The Tomb of Lord Uxbridge's Leg]) but the monument remains in the garden.&lt;/ref&gt;  There, the remains of his leg were removed principally by Doctor John Hume assisted by surgeons James Powell of the [[Ordnance Medical Department]], and James Callander of the [[7th Queen's Own Hussars|7th Hussars]], without [[antiseptic]] or [[anaesthetics]]. The [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] created him Marquess of Anglesey and made him a [[Knight Grand Cross]] of the [[Order of the Bath]] five days after the battle.

Lord Uxbridge, true to his nature, remained stoical and composed. According to his [[aide-de-camp]], [[Thomas Wildman]], during the amputation Paget smiled and said, "I have had a pretty long run. I have been a beau these forty-seven years, and it would not be fair to cut the young men out any longer." According to another anecdote his only comment through the procedure was, "The knives appear somewhat blunt."

According to the account of [[Hussey Vivian, 1st Baron Vivian|Sir Hussey Vivian]] recorded by Henry Curling in 1847:{{quote|Just after the Surgeon had taken off the Marquis of Anglesey's leg, Sir Hussey Vivian came into the cottage where the operation was performed. "Ah, Vivian!" said the wounded noble, "I want you to do me a favour. Some of my friends here seem to think I might have kept that leg on. Just go and cast your eye upon it, and tell me what you think." "I went, accordingly", said Sir Hussey, "and, taking up the lacerated limb, carefully examined it, and so far as I could tell, it was completely spoiled for work. A rusty grape-shot had gone through and shattered the bones all to pieces. I therefore returned to the Marquis and told him he could set his mind quite at rest, as his leg, in my opinion, was better off than on."&lt;ref name=USM/&gt;}}

A further anecdote reports him saying "Who would not lose a leg for such a victory?"&lt;ref name = Bains-468&gt;Edward Baines, ''History of the Wars of the French Revolution, from the Breaking Out of the War, in 1792, to the Restoration of a General Peace in 1815: Comprehending the Civil History of Great Britain and France, During that Period'', Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, 1818. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GMxLAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA467#PPA468,M1 p. 468]&lt;/ref&gt;  The saw used to amputate his leg is held by the [[National Army Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.national-army-museum.ac.uk/exhibitions/changingTheWorld/page2-1.shtml National Army Museum : Exhibitions : Changing the World : Key Objects&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206035951/http://www.national-army-museum.ac.uk/exhibitions/changingTheWorld/page2-1.shtml |date=2008-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Uxbridge was offered an annual pension of £1,200 in compensation for the loss of his leg, which he refused.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

==Shrine==
[[File:Marquess of Anglesey's Column - geograph.org.uk - 786189.jpg|thumb|Marquess of Anglesey's column, [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]], [[Anglesey]]]]
Paris asked if he might bury the leg in his garden, later turning the place into a kind of shrine, as for a [[relic]].  Visitors were first taken to see the bloody chair upon which Uxbridge had sat during the amputation, before being escorted into the garden, where the leg had its own 'tombstone', inscribed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|fr|Ci est enterré la Jambe de l'illustre et vaillant comte Uxbridge, Lieutenant-Général de S. M. Brittanique, Commandant en chef de la cavalerie anglaise, belge, et hollondaise, blessé le 18 juin 1815, à la mémorable bataille de Waterloo, qui, par son héroïsme, a concouru au triomphe de la cause du genre humaine, glorieusement décidéé par l'éclatante victoire du dit jour.}} (''[[Notes and Queries]]'', 3rd S. II, September 27, 1862, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PZsgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lr= p. 249])&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Here lies the Leg of the illustrious and valiant Earl Uxbridge, Lieutenant-General of His Britannic Majesty, Commander in Chief of the English, Belgian and Dutch cavalry, wounded on the 18 June 1815 at the memorable battle of Waterloo, who, by his heroism, assisted in the triumph of the cause of mankind, gloriously decided by the resounding victory of the said day.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some were impressed; others less so. According to an article headed "Marquis of Anglesey's Leg" in ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', 1862,&lt;ref name="NQ"&gt;''[[Notes and Queries]]'', 3rd S. II, September 27, 1862, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PZsgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lr= p. 249]&lt;/ref&gt; a wag wrote on the tombstone –

:''Here lies the Marquis of Anglesey's limb;''
:''The Devil will have the remainder of him.''

[[George Canning]] recorded his own impressions in verse.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Edinburgh Review#Edinburgh Review, 1802–1929|The Edinburgh Monthly Review]]'' Waugh and Innes, 1821 Volume 5 (1821)&lt;!--Original from Harvard University

The leg attracted an amazing range of tourists from European society of the very top drawer, from the [[King of Prussia]] to the [[Prince of Orange]].  It was a nice earner for Monsieur Paris and his descendants, all the way down to 1878, when it was the occasion for a minor diplomatic incident.  Uxbridge's son visited, to find the bones not buried, but on open display.  On investigation by the Belgian ambassador in London, it was discovered that they had been exposed in a storm which uprooted the [[willow]] tree beside which they were buried.  The ambassador demanded repatriation of the relics to England but the Paris family refused, instead offering to sell the bones to the Uxbridge family, who were enraged.  At this point the Belgian Minister of Justice intervened, ordering the bones to be reburied. However, the bones were not reburied; they were kept hidden.  In 1934, after the last Monsieur Paris died in Brussels, his widow found them in his study, along with documentation proving their provenance. Horrified by the thought of another scandal, she incinerated them in her central heating furnace.

==Aftermath==
Uxbridge's close family lost several limbs in the service of the United Kingdom during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]:  his brother, Major-General Sir [[Edward Paget]], lost his right arm in the crossing of the [[Douro]] during the [[Second Battle of Porto]] in 1809, and his daughter lost a hand tending her husband on a battlefield in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

Uxbridge used an articulated above-knee [[artificial limb|artificial leg]] invented by [[James Potts|James Potts of Chelsea]], with hinged knee and ankle and raising toes which became known as the [[Anglesey leg]], after his [[marquessate]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy Wendy B.

The loss of his leg did not impede the Marquess of Anglesey's career.

'''Earvin''' "'''Magic'''" '''Johnson Jr.''' (born August 14, 1959) is an American retired professional [[basketball]] player and current president of basketball operations of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He played [[point guard]] for the Lakers for 13 seasons. After winning championships in [[High school basketball#U.S. high school basketball|high school]] and [[College basketball|college]], Johnson was selected first overall in the [[1979 NBA draft]] by the Lakers. He won a championship and an [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award]] in his rookie season, and won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s. Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted [[HIV]], but returned to play in the [[1992 NBA All-Star Game|1992 All-Star Game]], winning the [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP Award]]. After protests from his fellow players, he retired again for four years, but returned in 1996, at age 36, to play 32&amp;nbsp;games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time.

Johnson's career achievements include three [[NBA MVP Awards]], nine [[NBA Finals]] appearances, twelve [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Star]] games, and ten [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] First and Second Team nominations. He led the league in regular-season [[assist (basketball)|assists]] four times, and is the NBA's all-time leader in average assists per game, at 11.2.&lt;ref name="alltimeassist"&gt;{{cite web|title=All Time Leaders: Assists Per Game|work=''www.nba.com''|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|url=http://www.nba.com/statistics/default_all_time_leaders/AllTimeLeadersAPGQuery.html?topic=4&amp;stat=10|accessdate=May 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was a member of the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team]] ("The Dream Team"), which won the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] gold medal in 1992. After leaving the NBA in 1992, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a [[barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] team that travelled around the world playing [[exhibition game]]s.&lt;ref name = barnstorm&gt;[http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/magic-johnson-at.htm "Magic Johnson."] ''www.entertainment.howstuffworks.com.''

His mother spent many hours after work each night cleaning their home and preparing the next day's meals, while his father did janitorial work at a used car lot and collected garbage, all while never missing a day at General Motors. Johnson would often help his father on the garbage route, and he was teased by neighborhood children who called him "Garbage Man".&lt;ref name=siblings&gt;Danois, Alejandro.

There were incidents of racism, with rocks being thrown at buses carrying black students and white parents refusing to send their children to school. Larry was kicked off the basketball team after a confrontation during practice, prompting him to beg his brother not to play. Johnson did join the basketball team but became angry after several days when his new teammates ignored him during practice, not even passing the ball to him. He nearly got into a fight with another player before head coach George Fox intervened. Eventually, Johnson accepted his situation and the small group of black students looked to him as their leader.&lt;ref name=mylife /&gt; When recalling the events in his autobiography, ''My Life'', he talked about how his time at Everett had changed him:

{{cquote|As I look back on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett.

==Professional career==

===Rookie season in the NBA (1979–1980)===
Johnson was [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|drafted first overall]] in 1979 by the [[1979–80 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]]. Johnson said that what was "most amazing" about joining the Lakers was the chance to play alongside [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Earvin "Magic"|author2=William Novak|title=My Life|page=113|isbn=1-902799-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team's 7&amp;nbsp;ft 2&amp;nbsp;in (2.18&amp;nbsp;m) [[center (basketball)|center]] who became the leading scorer in NBA history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_points.html|title=Regular Season Records: Points|publisher=''www.nba.com''|accessdate=February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Abdul-Jabbar's dominance, he had failed to win a championship with the Lakers, and Johnson was expected to help them achieve that goal.&lt;ref name="1980finals"&gt;{{cite web|work=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|title=Rookie Makes the Lakers Believe in Magic|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19791980.html|accessdate=May 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lakers coach [[Jack McKinney (basketball)|Jack McKinney]] had the {{convert|6|ft|9|in|m|adj=on}} rookie Johnson, who some analysts thought should play [[forward (basketball)|forward]], be a point guard, even though incumbent [[Norm Nixon]] was already one of the best in the league.&lt;ref name="extra"&gt;{{cite news|last=Helin|first=Kurt|title=The Extra Pass: Talking “Showtime” Lakers with author Jeff Pearlman|date=March 5, 2014|publisher=NBC Sports|url=https://nba.nbcsports.com/2014/03/05/the-extra-pass-talking-showtime-lakers-with-author-jeff-pearlman/|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsay|first=Dr. Jack|title=Dr. Jack's Leadership Lessons Learned From a Lifetime in Basketball|page=98|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uDQYw_Dr-hEC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=%22magic+johnson%22+forward+mckinney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XZoxFCdwNr&amp;sig=jhUxdwQS2bOzWDaQgqIIOBXvgWU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiBzYTW8N_dAhWLBIgKHd_0A7UQ6AEwDHoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-471-46929-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson averaged 18.0&amp;nbsp;points, 7.7&amp;nbsp;rebounds, and 7.3&amp;nbsp;assists per game for the season, was selected to the [[NBA All-Rookie Team]], and was named an [[NBA All-Star Game]] starter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/birdla01.html|title=Larry Bird Statistics|publisher=''www.basketball-reference.com''|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ups and downs (1980–1983)===
Early in the [[1980–81 NBA season|1980–81 season]], Johnson was sidelined after he suffered torn [[cartilage]] in his left knee.

In 1981, after the 1980–81 season, Johnson signed a 25-year, $25-million contract with the Lakers, which was the highest-paying contract in sports history up to that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Hs9RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-20DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2762,5761965&amp;dq|title=Johnson rubs LA's Magic lantern for 25 million bucks|date=June 27, 1981|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=10|accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the [[1981–82 NBA season|1981–82 season]], Johnson had a heated dispute with Westhead, who Johnson said made the Lakers "slow" and "predictable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Earvin "Magic"|author2=William Novak|title=My Life|page=141|isbn=1-902799-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Johnson demanded to be traded, Lakers owner [[Jerry Buss]] fired Westhead and replaced him with Riley.

===Battles against the Celtics (1983–1987)===

HIV had been associated with drug addicts and homosexuals,&lt;ref name="lifeafterdeath" /&gt; but Johnson's campaigns sought to show that the risk of infection was not limited to those groups.

Johnson introduced a fast-paced style of basketball called "[[Showtime (basketball)|Showtime]]", described as a mix of "no-look passes off the [[fast break|fastbreak]], pin-point [[Alley-oop (basketball)|alley-oops]] from [[half court|halfcourt]], spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through [[double team|triple teams]]."&lt;ref name="nbafullbio" /&gt; Fellow Lakers guard [[Michael Cooper]] said, "There have been times when [Johnson] has thrown passes and I wasn't sure where he was going. Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores, and I run back up the floor convinced that he must've thrown it through somebody."&lt;ref name="nbafullbio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="espnshowtime" /&gt;  Johnson could dominate a game without scoring, running the offense and distributing the ball with flair.&lt;ref name=espn_alltime_rank/&gt; In the [[1982 NBA Finals]], he was named the Finals MVP averaging just 16.2 points, the lowest average of any Finals MVP award recipient in the three-point shot era.&lt;ref name=espn_alltime_rank/&gt;

Johnson was exceptional because he played point guard despite being 6&amp;nbsp;ft 9&amp;nbsp;in (2.06&amp;nbsp;m), a size reserved normally for [[frontcourt]] players.&lt;ref name="nbafullbio" /&gt; He combined the size of a power forward, the one-on-one skills of a [[swingman]], and the ball handling talent of a guard, making him one of the most dangerous [[triple-double]] threats of all time; his 138&amp;nbsp;triple-double games are second only to [[Oscar Robertson]]'s 181.&lt;ref name="tripledouble"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wojnarowski|first=Adrian|title=Making triple trouble|date=November 18, 2006|publisher=Yahoo!

===Rivalry with Larry Bird===
{{See also|Lakers–Celtics rivalry}}
Johnson and [[Larry Bird]] were first linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad defeated Bird's Indiana State team in the 1979 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] finals. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers–Celtics games. Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily [[box score]] was the first thing he checked in the morning.&lt;ref name="magiclarryquotes" /&gt;

Several journalists hypothesized that the Johnson–Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness ("Showtime") and Boston/Indiana [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] grit ("Celtic Pride"), and between blacks and whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bork|first=Gunter|title=Basketball Sternstunden|year=1995|pages=49–55}} {{ISBN|3-7679-0456-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/web/COM1057184/1/index.htm|title=The Stuff Dreams Are Made Of|last=Halberstam|first=David|date=June 29, 1987|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, Rome. {{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/26/earlyshow/leisure/main523385.shtml|title='Magic' Time|publisher=''www.cbsnews.com''|date=September 26, 2002|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won a whole generation of new fans,&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/08/14/magic020814.html|title=Larry Bird inducting Magic Johnson|publisher=''www.cbc.ca''|date=August 15, 2002|accessdate=May 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair. According to sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN, Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref name="espnshowtime" /&gt;

Despite their on-court rivalry, Johnson and Bird became close friends during the filming of a 1984 [[Converse (company)|Converse]] shoe advertisement that depicted them as enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aamidor|first=Abraham|title=Chuck Taylor, All Star: The True Story of the Man Behind the Most Famous Athletic Shoe in History|year=2006|page=151|isbn=0-253-34698-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014103.html|title=Eye for victory|last=Schwartz|first=Larry|publisher=''www.espn.com''|accessdate=February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony in 1992, and described Bird as a "friend forever";&lt;ref name="magiclarryquotes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/Classic_NBA_Quotes_Magic_and_Larry.html|title=Classic NBA Quotes: Magic and Larry|publisher=''NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition''|accessdate=September 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; during Johnson's Hall of Fame ceremony, Bird formally inducted his old rival.&lt;ref name="cbc" /&gt;

In 2009, Johnson and Bird collaborated with journalist [[Jackie MacMullan]] on a non-fiction book titled ''When the Game Was Ours''. The book detailed their on-court rivalry and friendship with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheinin|first1=Dave|title=Book review: When the Game Was Ours by Larry Bird and Magic Johnson|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/11/AR2009121101705.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 12, 2016|date=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[HBO]] developed a documentary about their rivalry titled ''[[Magic &amp; Bird: A Courtship of Rivals]]'', which was directed by [[Ezra Edelman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clinchy |first1=Evans |title=HBO Documentary Revisits Magic Johnson–Larry Bird Rivalry That Saved Basketball |url=https://nesn.com/2010/03/hbo-documentary-revisits-magicbird-rivalry-that-saved-basketball/ |website=NESN.com |accessdate=October 31, 2018 |date=March 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Jerry Buss==
Magic Johnson had an extremely close relationship with Lakers owner [[Jerry Buss]], whom he saw as a mentor and a father figure.&lt;ref name=father&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4dFPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-gcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=johnson%20part%20owner%20of%20the%20lakers&amp;pg=6886%2C4351985 "Report: Johnson to become part owner of Lakers."] ''Ocala [Florida] Star-Banner'', June 27, 1994. ''Google News Archives.'' Retrieved May 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Calling Buss his "second father" and "one of [his] best friends", Johnson spent five hours visiting Buss at the hospital just a few months before his death from [[cancer]]. Speaking to media just hours after Buss had died, Johnson was emotional, saying, "Without Dr. Jerry Buss, there is no Magic."&lt;ref name=jbuss&gt;Plaschke, Bill. [http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/19/sports/la-sp-magic-jerry-buss-20130219 "To Magic Johnson, Jerry Buss was friend, mentor, and 'second father.'"] ''Los Angeles Times'', February 19, 2013. Retrieved May 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Buss acquired the team from [[Jack Kent Cooke]] in 1979, shortly before he drafted Johnson with the #1 pick in the [[1979 NBA draft]]. In addition to playing 13 seasons for the Lakers and coaching the team briefly in 1994, Johnson also had an ownership stake in the team for nearly twenty years. Buss took a special interest in Johnson, introducing him to important Los Angeles business contacts and showing him how the Lakers organization was run, before eventually selling Johnson a stake in the team in 1994.&lt;ref name=jbuss /&gt; Johnson credits Buss with giving him the business knowledge that enabled him to become part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers.&lt;ref name=jbuss /&gt;&lt;ref name=doctor&gt;[http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/magic-johnson-says-jerry-buss-made-him-man-he-is-today-021913 "Magic Johnson says Jerry Buss made him man he is today."] ''www.msn.foxsports.com'', February 20, 2013. Retrieved May 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Buss supported Johnson as he revealed his diagnosis of HIV in 1991, and he never hesitated to keep Johnson close to the organization, bringing him in as part-owner, and even as a coach.
Johnson had never seriously considered coaching, but he agreed take the head coaching position with the Lakers in 1994 at Buss' request. In 1992, Buss had given Johnson a contract that paid him $14 million a year, as payback for all the years he was not the league's highest paid player. Although Johnson's retirement prior to the [[1992–93 NBA season]] voided this contract, Buss insisted that he still be paid.&lt;ref name=jbuss /&gt; It was this arrangement that allowed Johnson to coach the team without receiving any additional salary.&lt;ref name=brief /&gt;&lt;ref name=father /&gt; After Johnson ended his coaching stint, Buss sold him a 4% stake in the Lakers for $10 million, and Johnson served as a team executive.&lt;ref name=jbuss /&gt;

'''Michael Pillsbury''' (born February 8, 1945) is the American Director of the Center on Chinese Strategy, [[Hudson Institute]], [[Washington, D.C.]], from 2014. He is the author of three books on China.  The most recent one, ''The Hundred-Year Marathon'',  is an international bestseller{{cn|date=November 2018}} and was number one on the ''[[Washington Post]]'' list,&lt;ref&gt;February 15, 2015.{{full|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a selection of the Commander, U.S. Special Operations Command, Commanders Reading List, in 2017,{{cn|date=November 2018}} with Korean, Japanese, Taiwan-Chinese, PRC-Chinese, Hindi, and Mongolian editions also published.{{cn|date=November 2018}} On September 26, 2018 U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] described Michael Pillsbury as "the leading authority on China.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Tweed|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-27/trump-identifies-the-leading-authority-on-china-who-is-he|title=This Is the Man Trump Described as ‘The Leading Authority on China’|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=September 27, 2018|page=A1|accessdate=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 30, 2018 The New York Times, Politico and Bloomberg articles asserted Michael Pillsbury's importance of being one of Trump's top advisers on China.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lexey|last=Swall|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/us/politics/trump-china-trade-xi-michael-pillsbury.html|title=A China Hawk Gains Prominence as Trump Confronts Xi on Trade’|work=[[The New York Times|The New York Times]]|date=November 30, 2018|page=A1|accessdate=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Mayeda|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-28/there-s-no-cold-war-with-china-says-trump-s-hawkish-adviser|title=There's No Cold War With China, Says Trump's Hawkish Adviser’|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=November 28, 2018|page=A1|accessdate=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ben|last=SCHRECKINGER |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/30/trump-china-xi-jinping-g20-michael-pillsbury-1034610|title=

==Career==
During the Reagan administration, Pillsbury was the Assistant Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Planning and responsible for implementation of the program of covert aid known as the [[Reagan Doctrine]]. In 1975–76, while an analyst at the [[RAND Corporation]], Pillsbury published articles in ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' and ''[[International Security]]'' recommending that the United States establish intelligence and military ties with China. The proposal, publicly commended by [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Henry Kissinger]], and [[James Schlesinger]], later became US policy during the Carter and Reagan administrations.

Pillsbury served on the staff of four US Senate Committees from 1978–1984 and 1986–1991. As a staff member, Pillsbury drafted the Senate Labor Committee version of the legislation that enacted the [[US Institute of Peace]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mary E.|last=Montgomery|title=Working for Peace While Preparing for War: The Creation of the United States Institute of Peace|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=40|issue=4|year=2003|pages=479–496|doi=10.1177/00223433030404007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also assisted in drafting the legislation to create the [[National Endowment for Democracy]] and the annual requirement for a DOD report on Chinese military power.

In 1992, under President [[George H. W. Bush]], Pillsbury was Special Assistant for Asian Affairs in the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]], reporting to [[Andrew W. Marshall]], Director of Net Assessment. Pillsbury is a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]].

In 2015, a former CIA Director revealed that a book called ''The Hundred-Year Marathon'' "is based on work Michael Pillsbury did that landed him the CIA Director's Exceptional Performance Award." The official website has declassified documents and photos that illustrate the book.

Pillsbury played a role in three Presidential actions:

===US–China military and intelligence ties===
Pillsbury participated in President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s decision in 1979–80, as modified by President Reagan in 1981, to initiate military and intelligence ties with China.&lt;ref name="mann"&gt;{{cite book|first=James|last=Mann|title=About Face: A History of America's Curious Relationship with China, from Nixon to Clinton|publisher=Knopf|year=1998|isbn=978-0-679-76861-6|authorlink=James Mann (writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Banning|last=Garrett|title=The China Card and its Origins|publisher=Brandeis University doctoral dissertation}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2018}}

According to [[Raymond L. Garthoff]], "Michael Pillsbury first floated the idea of arms sales and broad range of American military security relationships with China in a much-discussed article in ''Foreign Policy'' in the fall of 1975. Not known then was that Pillsbury had been conducting secret talks with Chinese officials … his reports were circulated to a dozen or so top officials of the NSC, Department of Defense and Department of State as secret documents."&lt;ref name="garthoff"&gt;{{cite book|first=Raymond L.|last=Garthoff|title=Détente and Confrontation: American-Soviet Relations from Nixon to Reagan|publisher=Brookings Institution|year=1983|isbn=978-0-8157-3044-6|authorlink=Raymond L. Garthoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|696}} According to the book ''US–China Cold War Collaboration, 1971–1989'', "The man spearheading the effort was not a public official, and enjoyed deniability. Michael Pillsbury, a China analyst at the RAND Corporation… spent the summer of 1973 secretly meeting PLA officers stationed under diplomatic cover at China's UN mission… The DoD managed Pillsbury. Pillsbury filed a report, L-32, in March 1974… L-32 was a seminal paper on which subsequent US-PRC military cooperation blossomed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mahmud|last=Ali|title=US-China Cold War Collaboration, 1971–1989|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=978-0-415-35819-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|81}} [[James Mann (writer)|James Mann]] wrote, "Outward appearances indicate that Pillsbury may have been working with American intelligence agencies from the very start of his relationship with General Zhang… In the fall of 1973, Pillsbury submitted a classified memo suggesting the novel idea that the United States might establish a military relationship with China… This was the genesis of the ideas of a 'China card,' the notion that the United States might use China to gain Cold War advantage over the Soviet Union. The idea would eventually come to dominate American thinking about the new relationship with China."&lt;ref name="mann" /&gt;{{rp|58–59}}

===Stingers for Afghanistan decision===
Pillsbury participated in President Reagan's decision in 1986 to order the CIA to arm the Afghan resistance with [[Stinger missiles]]. According to the UN Undersecretary General who negotiated the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, "Initially, the Stinger campaign was spearheaded by Undersecretary of Defense for Policy [[Fred Ikle]] and his aggressive Coordinator for Afghan Affairs, Michael Pillsbury… The Stinger proponents won their victory in the face of overwhelming bureaucratic resistance that persisted until the very end of the struggle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cordovez|first=Diego|title=Out of Afghanistan: The Inside Story of the Soviet Withdrawal|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-19-506294-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|195}} Mann wrote, "For Michael Pillsbury, the covert operations in Afghanistan represented the fulfillment of the decade-old dream of American military cooperation with China… To help him win the argument, Pillsbury made use of his China connections."&lt;ref name="mann" /&gt;{{rp|137–139}} [[George Crile III|George Crile]] stated in ''[[Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History|Charlie Wilson's War]]'' that, "Ironically, neither [[Gust Avrakotos|[Gust] Avrakotos]] nor [[Charles Wilson (Texas politician)|[Charlie] Wilson]] was directly involved in the decision and claims any credit."&lt;ref name="wilsonwar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crile|first=George|title=Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History|publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-87113-854-5|authorlink=George Crile III}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|419}}&lt;ref name="heymann"&gt;{{cite book|first=Philip|last=Heymann|title=Living the Policy Process|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-533539-2|authorlink=Philip Heymann}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Milt|last1=Bearden|first2=James|last2=Risen|title=The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB|publisher=Ballantine|year=2004|isbn=978-0-345-47250-2|pages=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coll"&gt;{{cite book|first=Steve|last=Coll|title=Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan and bin Laden|publisher=Penguin|year=2004|isbn=978-1-59420-007-6|authorlink=Steve Coll}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref name="binladens"&gt;{{cite book|first=Steve|last=Coll|title=The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century|year=2009|publisher= Penguin|isbn=978-1-59420-164-6|authorlink=Steve Coll}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref name="lundberg"&gt;{{cite report|first=Kirsten|last=Lundberg|title=Politics of a Covert Action: The US, the Mujahideen, and the Stinger Missile|publisher=Kennedy School of Government Case Program.

Harvard University's JFK School of Government published what it called the first case study of how covert action policy is made and describes the role of Michael Pillsbury.&lt;ref name="lundberg"/&gt;{{rp|24}} According to ''Charlie Wilson's War'', "The moving force in this group was an engaging, well-born conservative intellectual named Mike Pillsbury, then serving as the Pentagon's deputy undersecretary in charge of overseeing covert programs. Pillsbury, a former Senate staffer and China expert, had been an early believer in the program…"&lt;ref name="wilsonwar"/&gt;{{rp|415–416}} According to [[Philip Heymann]] in his 2008 book ''Living the Policy Process'', "A policy player such as Michael Pillsbury may have absorbed many of the critical rules of the game of shared policy choice without even thinking of them as rules."&lt;ref name="heymann"/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2018}}

Heymann wrote that "providing Stinger missiles was obviously of such importance or political prominence that the President would want to decide. This decision is obviously of that character for several reasons. If approved, we may be furnishing a terrifying weapon to a present or future enemy. There is a small chance that we will encourage dangerous forms of retaliation by the Soviet Union. Even the shift from a "plausibly deniable" covert action to the open support of a guerrilla force fighting the Soviet Union would raise issues in Congress that the President would want to consider in light of his staff's advice."&lt;ref name="heymann"/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2018}}

Pillsbury worked through the secret Planning and Coordination Group. Heymann wrote, "This committee was secret, and public details about it are sketchy… The covert action committee met every three to four weeks. Its existence was not officially acknowledged, although such a committee had operated in every administration since Eisenhower. In the Kennedy administration, for example, it was known as the Forty Committee. Any information on covert actions was protected under a compartmentalized security system given the name VEIL."&lt;ref name="heymann"/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2018}}

According to [[Steve Coll]], in 1985–1986 [[Osama Bin Laden]] also wanted US weapons including the Stinger missiles. Coll wrote, "Michael Pillsbury flies to the Afghan frontier to review training facilities used by two Afghan warlords, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Abdul Rasul Sayyaf… Bin Laden family head [[Salem bin Laden]] asks the Pentagon to supply anti-aircraft missiles to Arab volunteers fighting in the Soviet-Afghan War. The request is made on behalf of Salem's brother Osama [Bin Laden], who is establishing a semi-autonomous group of Arab volunteers outside the direct control of local Afghan commanders and will set up a camp just for Arabs later this year… Later research will indicate that there is no formal decision by the Reagan administration not to supply the missiles or other equipment to the Arab volunteers. Pentagon official Michael Pillsbury will later say he was not aware of any such decision, but if such a decision had been taken, he would have been aware of it."&lt;ref name="coll"/&gt;{{rp|287}}

===Studies of China and the Pentagon's annual report===
In 1997–2007, Pillsbury published research reports and two books on China's view of future warfare. According to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2005, Pillsbury's findings were added to the reports the Secretary of Defense sent to Congress on Chinese military power in 2002–2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Neil|last=King|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB112613947626134749|format=Fee required|title=Secret Weapon: Inside Pentagon, A Scholar Shapes Views of China|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=September 8, 2005|page=A1|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Pillsbury Factor|work=The Oriental Economist|date=August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Pillsbury signed a nonpartisan report of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] task force on Chinese military power. The task force found that China is pursuing a deliberate course of military modernization, but is at least two decades behind the United States in terms of military technology and capability. The task force report stated it was a "nonpartisan approach to measuring the development of Chinese military power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Segal|first=Adam|title=Chinese Military Power Independent Task Force Report|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-87609-330-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2018}} He has discussed the threat the people's republic of China poses to the United States of America with [[Tucker Carlson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hudson.org/research/14318-the-china-threat|title=The China Threat|first=Michael|last=Pillsbury|website=Hudson.org|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Pillsbury's scholarship has been questioned by ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' assistant editor Soyoung Ho, in his article "Panda Slugger, the dubious scholarship of Michael Pillsbury, the China hawk with Rumsfeld's ear", published in the July/August issue in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ho |first1=Soyoung |title=Panda Slugger, the dubious scholarship of Michael Pillsbury, the China hawk with Rumsfeld's ear. |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0607.ho1.html |work=Washington Monthly |accessdate=3 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214060701/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0607.ho1.html |archivedate=14 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mushulatubbee''' ([[Choctaw language|Choctaw]] ''{{lang|cho|AmoshuliTabi}}'', "Determined to Kill") (born c. 1750–1770, died c. 1838) was the chief of the [[Choctaw]] ''Okla Tannap'' ("Lower Towns"), one of the three major Choctaw divisions during the early 19th century.  When the Principal Chief [[Greenwood LeFlore]] stayed in Mississippi at the time of [[Indian Removal Act|removal]], Mushulatubbee was elected as principal chief, leading the tribe to [[Indian Territory]].

In 1812 he had led his warriors to assist General [[Andrew Jackson]] in the war against the Creek [[Red Sticks]], known as the [[Creek Wars]].

In December 1824 Mushulatubbee was one of three principal chiefs leading a Choctaw delegation to Washington to seek help against encroaching European-American settlers. [[Pushmataha]] and [[Apuckshunubbee]] were the other chiefs; Apuckshunubbee, age 80, died before they reached Washington, and Pushmataha died of illness in the capital soon after their meeting with the government.

On 26 September 1830, together with the Principal Chief Greenwood LeFlore and others, Mushulatubbee signed the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]], which ceded to the US government most of the remaining Choctaw territory in [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]] in exchange for territory in [[Indian Territory]].  Other spellings for his name include: ''Mosholetvbbi'', ''AmoshuliTvbi'', ''Musholatubbee'', ''Moshaleh Tubbee'', and ''Mushulatubba''.

==Creek Wars==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}
The great Shawnee leader [[Tecumseh]] visited Mushulatubbee in 1811 when he came south to get support for his Great Confederacy, in an effort to push out the European Americans. Today it is known as [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]]. Tecumseh met Moshulatubbee at his village Mashulaville (located in present-day [[Noxubee County, Mississippi]]). He was chief of ''Okla Tannap'' (Lower Towns), the southern division of the three major geographic and [[clan]] Choctaw areas of settlement. Other major divisions were in the northeast, including part of Alabama; and the west, near Vicksburg. Mushulatubbee had sympathy for Tecumseh and his cause, but decided he was too old to do anything for the confederacy, so remained neutral.

In addition to fighting with Jackson and his forces against the Creek, Mushulatubbee led 52 Choctaw warriors in the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in 1814. They fought in the swamps and cypress trees, picking off many British pickets and demoralizing them.  They kept shooting down the Red Coats, as they were fighting for their homeland. When the [[Battle of New Orleans]] was over, Moshulatubbee and his 52 warriors returned home. They left the service on January 27, 1815, from Fort Stoddard.

==Land cessions==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}
Under continuing pressure from European-American settlers and the United States government, Mushulatubbee signed the [[Treaty of the Choctaw Trading House]] on 24 October 1816, and the [[Treaty Ground]] on 18 October 1820 to cede land. The US failed to prevent settlers from continuing to encroach on Choctaw territory.

==Journey to Washington==
In 1824, [[Pushmataha]], Mushulatubee, and [[Apuckshunubbee]], the three chiefs of the Choctaw regional divisions, became concerned about the encroaching settlement of European Americans and the unwillingness of local authorities to respect Indian land titles.  They still hoped to offset the government's push for removal west of the Mississippi River and resolved to take their case to the Federal government in [[Washington, D.C.]]  Pushmataha led the delegation; they sought either expulsion of white settlers from deeded lands in [[Arkansas]], or compensation in land and cash for such lands.&lt;ref name=mhs&gt;

They planned to travel the [[Natchez Trace]] to Nashville, then to [[Lexington, Kentucky]]; onward to [[Maysville, Kentucky]]; across the [[Ohio River]] (called the ''Spaylaywitheepi'' by the Shawnee) northward to [[Chillicothe, Ohio]] (former principal town of the Shawnee); then finally east over the "National Highway" to Washington City.
&lt;ref name=choctaw_nation_earl_white /&gt;

While in Washington, the chief also met with the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], who was visiting [[Washington, D.C.]] for the last time.  He hailed him as a fellow aged warrior who, though foreign, rose to high renown in the American cause.

{{quote|You are one of our fathers that fought in the War with Gen. [[George Washington]]. We take you here by the hand as a friend and a father. We have always walked in the white paths of peace; and in those paths we have traveled to visit you. We offer you pure hands, which have never been stained with the blood of Americans.-- We live in the south, where the sun shines hot upon us. We have been neighbors to the [[France|French]], neighbors to the [[Spaniards]], and neighbors to the [[England|English]]: but now our only neighbors are the Americans, in the midst of whom we live as friends and brothers.|Mushulatubba, ''The Essex Register '', 2 December 1824.&lt;ref name="marquis_speech"&gt;

==Candidate for U.S. Congress==
In 1830 Mushulatubbee announced his candidacy for office in Mississippi in the ''Port Gibson Correspondent'', as reported by the ''Christian Mirror and N.H. Observer'' (15 July 1830).&lt;ref name="us_congress"&gt;

{{quote|To the voters of Mississippi. Fellow Citizens:-I have fought for you, I have been by your own act, made a citizen of your state; ... According to your laws I am an American citizen, ... I have always battled on the side of this republic ... I have been told by my white brethren, that the pen of history is impartial, and that in after years, our forlorn kindred will have justice and 'mercy too'.|Mushulatubba, ''Christian Mirror and N.H. Observer'', July 1830.&lt;ref name="us_congress"/&gt;
}}  

The US government forced the Choctaw to remove to [[Indian Territory]] west of the Mississippi River.  Mushulatubbee was the chief of his division during the removal and for a time after their resettlement in what became [[Oklahoma]]. The government had encouraged the Choctaw to resettle in their former clan divisions.  Relocation soon led to changes in the society in which those clan divisions became less important.

'''Muslim ibn Aqil Al-Hashimi''' ([[Arabic]]: مسلم بن عقيل الهاشمي) was the son of [[Aqeel ibn Abi Talib]] and a member of the clan of [[Bani Hashim]], thus, he is a cousin of [[Husayn ibn Ali]]. The people of Kufa called upon Husayn to overthrow the [[Umayyad dynasty]] who was on his way to Mecca for the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage. He wanted to confirm the loyalty of the people of Kufa, so he sent his cousin and his ambassador, Muslim ibn Aqeel, a famous warrior, to Kufa to observe the situation. He sent a letter to Husayn confirming their loyalty, before knowing that the 30,000 followers that he gained would all betray him. He was executed by the newly installed governor, [[Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad]], on the 20th of Rabi Ul Awal, 60 AH,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hujjat.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=142:hadhrat-muslim-ibn-aqeel-a&amp;catid=28&amp;Itemid=100013&lt;/ref&gt; and is buried at the back of [[Great Mosque of Kufa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jafariyanews.com/2k3_news/apr/27_kufa.htm |title=Hundreds of thousands’ Friday assemblage in Masjid-e-Uzma Kufa |accessdate=20 November 2008 |work=Jafariyanews.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journey to Kufa==

=== Letters from Kufa===

Husayn ibn Ali received thousands of letters from people of [[Kufa]] stating that they were rejecting their governor and asking him to come and serve as their Imam. One letter in particular contained these words: ''“We invite you to come to Kufa as we have no Imam to guide us. Through you Allah will unite us on the path of truth.”'' A few days later, the people of Kufa sent an emissary, a special messenger, to Husayn ibn Ali to persuade him to go to Kufa. There followed hundreds of other letters and many special emissaries from the people of Kufa to Husayn ibn Ali.

Receiving so many petitions and messages from Kufa, Husayn ibn Ali decided to send Muslim ibn Aqeel, who was a famous warrior, as his emissary to Kufa to study the situation there and report to Husayn ibn Ali.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barnaby Rogerson|Rogerson, Barnaby]]. '''The Heirs of Muhammad'''. Woodstock, NY: The Overlook Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim's Assignment===

He wrote a letter to the people of Kufa and gave it to Muslim ibn Aqeel. In this letter Husayn ibn Ali said, ''“I am sending my cousin and one of the most trusted ones from my family, Muslim ibn Aqeel, to report to me about your affairs. If his report agrees with what you have written I will soon be with you. You must be clear of the fact that the Imam is the only one who follows the book of Allah, and serves Allah in all matters and affairs with justice, honesty and truth.”''&lt;ref name=Jafri&gt;Jafri, Syed Husian Mohammad. '''The Origins and Early Development of Shi'a Islam'''. Oxford: Orxford UP, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Husayn ibn Ali also told Ibn Aqeel: ''“Muslim, the whole world knows that you are one of the bravest warriors. It is just possible that seeing you in Kufa some people may think that our intention is to fight Yazid. Take your two sons Muhammad and Ibrahim with you. When they see you with such young children, they will know that our intentions are peaceful.”''

According to reports, Muslim ibn Aqeel’s sons were so young, that they could not even tie up the buttons of their shirts.

Husayn sent three people with Muslim: Qays Ibn Mash'ar, 'Imarah Ibn 'Abdullah al-Saluli, and 'Abdul Rahman Ibn 'Abdullah al-Azd, in addition to the messenger from Kufa.&lt;ref name=Islam&gt;Kitab al-Irshad. Excerpts from al-Islam.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traveling to Kufa===
This group set off from [[Mecca]] on the 15th of Ramadan. His first destination was [[Medina]], where he left his family and hired two people to guide him on his way. The guides, however, lost their way in the desert and were too weak from lack of water to continue on. But in their weakened physical state, they managed to show Muslim the right direction before they both died of thirst.

==In Kufa==

=== The Kufan's Pledge of Allegiance===
Muslim arrived in Kufa on 5 Shawwal 60 AH/ 9 July 680. He went first to the house of al-Mukhtar ibn Abu 'Ubayd al-Thaqafi, who was highly liked by his people and who later became the person who ordered the murder of Ibn Ziyad.&lt;ref name=Julius&gt;Wellhausen, Julius. '''The Religio-Political Factions in Early Islam.''' New York: U of Hull, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 18,000-30,000 people appeared before Muslim ibn Aqeel and enthusiastically pledged their allegiance to Husayn ibn Ali as their Imam and pledged to support Husayn even with their lives.&lt;ref name=Tabari&gt;Tabari. Excerpts from Al-Islam.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim ibn Aqeel, encouraged by this response, reported to Husayn ibn Ali by letter that he should proceed to Kufa.&lt;ref name=Jafri /&gt;

The governor of Kufa, al-Nu'man Ibn Bashir, was told of Muslim's arrival, but refused to attack him. Bashir was a mild man and did not want to harm the members of the family of the Prophet, so he did nothing to stop Muslim.&lt;ref name=Ayoub&gt;Ayoub, Mahmoud. '''Redeptive Suffering in Islam'''. London: U of Toronto, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the supporters of Yazid saw this lack of action as a sign of weakness and encouraged the caliph to replace Bashir with a stronger man. Yazid then deposed Bashir and replaced him with Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad. Ibn Ziyad  was a resourceful and often cruel politician who spared nothing in order to attain political ends. His strong and ruthless character was exactly what the caliph was looking for in order to gain control in Kufa.&lt;ref name=Ayoub/&gt; Yazid wrote to him, ''"Go to Kufa, capture Muslim ibn 'Aqil and see what is appropriate to imprison him, send him to exile or kill him."'' &lt;ref name=Brill&gt;Kohlberg, E. "Muslim B. Akil B. Ali Talib" '''The Encyclopedia of Islam'''. 2nd ed. Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor's Warning===
The morning of his arrival in Kufa, Ibn Ziyad gathered the people at the grand mosque. There he delivered a speech warning them against mutiny and promised them generous rewards for conforming.  He said, ''"Anyone found to be sheltering one of those who scheme against the authority of the commander of the faithful and who does not hand him over will be crucified on the door of his own house".'' &lt;ref name=Islam/&gt;

===Searching for Muslim===
During this time, Ibn Ziyad was working diligently to discover the hiding place of Muslim. He knew that the people of Kufa were meeting secretly, but he was not able to figure out the location. Ibn Ziyad decided that the best way to find Muslim would be to infiltrate his inner circle. He called upon his servant, Ma'qil, to meet him. He gave Ma'qil three thousand dirhams and ordered him to meet with the Shi'as. He was to tell them that he was a Syrian slave who has just arrived in the country and wanted to hand deliver a donation to Muslim. Ma'qil entered the grand mosque and was introduced to Muslim. Ma'qil then delivered the money and swore allegiance to him.  This servant continued to meet with Muslim in the coming days. No secrets were kept from him, so he kept gathering information, which he then reported back to Ibn Ziyad in the evenings.&lt;ref name=Brill/&gt;

===Hani's Arrest===
With the information from Ma'qil, Ibn Ziyad was able to figure out that Muslim was staying at the house of Hani. The governor gathered some of the friends of Hani and asked why he had not visited in quite a while. They made excuses for him, saying that he had been sick and other similar things. Hani was then summoned by the governor who accused him of harboring Muslim in his house.&lt;ref name=Islam/&gt; Hani denied this claim and things got heated. Ibn Ziyad then called in Ma'qil and had him corroborate the story that Ibn Ziyad was trying to paint. At this point, Hani was arrested, beaten in the face with an iron-tipped cane, and thrown into prison and was later executed with Muslim ibn Aqeel.

Muslim reported to Husayn through Abis ibn Shabib that most of the people in Kufa were ready to receive him as their Imam and advised that Husayn should proceed to Kufa (Tareekh-e-Tabri, Vol.6, Page211). Amongst the people of Kufa there were many spies employed by Yazid to report to him directly. When Yazid heard from them of the invitations to Hussain and the arrival in Kufa of Muslim he was filled with fury. He sent a message to his Governor in Basrah, Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad, to go to Kufa and take over the position of Nu'amaan ibne Basheer. Ibn Ziyad was also told to arrest Muslim and murder him and do all that was necessary to suppress the Shiahs in Kufa.

Ibn Ziyad was a shrewd man. He kept his journey from Basra to Kufa a secret and just before entering Kufa he covered his face with a black scarf so that he could not be recognized. He had a few horsemen in front of him and a few behind him as he entered Kufa. The people of Kufa had been waiting for the arrival of Imam Hussain anxiously and they presumed that the Imam had arrived. Soon people started gathering around him and singing welcoming songs. Ibn Ziyad kept observing the people and memorizing faces as the crowd grew and soon it was difficult for his convoy to proceed swiftly. One of his guards, Muslim bin Amr Bahili, shouted "Clear the way, this is the Amir Ubaidullah ibn Ziyad". Hearing this, people started running away quickly and when Ibn Ziyad reached the Dar-al-Amara only a handful people had been left. Ibn Ziyad arrived in Kufa on the evening of 2nd Dhul-Hajj. On the following day he went to the mosque and addressed the people of Kufa. He first announced his appointment as Yazid's governor. He then threatened any one who was engaged in any activity against the government with immediate death, and ordered them to surrender Muslim to him.

Ibn Ziyad sealed Kufa in such a way that no one could go in or out of the city without the governor's permission.

==Death==

Since several people knew that he was staying with Mukhtar Thaqafi, Muslim decided to move from there as a measure of precaution and protection. At the invitation of Hani ibn Urwah, another leading member of the Shia community, he moved to Hani's house. This was done secretly and except for a few people no one knew where Muslim was. Through a spy, Maaqal, who pretended to be a Shia, Ibn Ziyad found out where Muslim was. Since ibn Ziyad had prior relations with Hani, he called him by trick to his palace and got him arrested and thrown into prison. Muslim got the news of Hani's arrest and not wishing to further endanger the lives of his friends, Muslim and his two sons left Hani's house. He left the children with Shurayb, a judge, and went into the desert to try to get back to Husayn to warn him not to go to Kufa. This was the 7th of Dhul-Hajj. That whole day and the following day Muslim tried to get out of the city. He found all the exits sealed and guarded by Ibn Ziyad's soldiers.

=== Muslim at the House of Tuwaa ===
On the 7th, late in the evening, tired, hungry and exhausted,  [[Muslim]] knocked on the door of a house on the outskirts of the city. A lady named 'Tuwaa" opened the door. Muslim requested for a little water to quench his thirst. The lady gave him water. When she learnt who he was, she invited him in and offered him shelter for the night. She gave Muslim  food and water and took him to a room where he spent the night.

Late that night Tuwaa's son came home. When he learned that the man Ibn Ziyad was looking for was in his mother's house, he felt that he would be rewarded by the governor if he got Muslim arrested. Unknown to his mother he slipped out in the darkness of the night and gave the information to a captain in Ibn Ziyad's army. Early the next morning, five hundred soldiers under the leadership of Mohammad bin Ashas surrounded the house of Tuwaa and demanded Muslim's surrender. Muslim came out holding his sword. Three times he drove the enemy away and killed 150 men. Twice Ibn Ziyad had to send in reinforcements.

While Muslim was fighting, some soldiers went up the rooftops and began throwing stones and lighted torches at him. Others dug a trench in the path of  Muslim and covered it with grass. Ibn Ziyad told his commanders to trick Muslim otherwise it would not be possible to capture him. Although badly wounded and totally exhausted, Muslim kept on fighting. As a trick, soldiers of Ibn Ziyad offered peace and protection to Muslim but he rejected the offer. He was deeply wounded in this tough fight and finally fell into the trench. He was pounced upon, chained and dragged to the court of Ibn Ziyad.

===Execution===
Historians narrate that Muslim was badly wounded when he entered the court of Ibn Ziyad. His teeth were broken and blood was flowing from all over. Still he entered the court like a 'Lion'. Someone in the court told him to pay respect to Ibn Ziyad because he is the "Amir" (Ruler). Muslim refused and replied that his [[Amir]] was only Husayn.

Ibn Ziyad told Muslim that he would be killed and asked him if he had any last wishes. Muslim replied saying, "I owe a debt which should be discharged by selling off my sword and armour. Secondly I want my body to be given a proper burial. Thirdly I want a message sent to Hussain advising him not to come to Kufa." Ibn Ziyad agreed to the first request but refused to do anything about the second and third requests. He then ordered Muslim to be taken to the roof of the palace to be executed and his body thrown to the ground.

Muslim was calm and composed as he was dragged up the steps. He was reciting "Allahu Akber" until the last moment. Then there was an absolute silence followed by a thud as the head of Muslim was chopped and his body fell to the ground. This was on the 9th of Dhul-Hujja. Immediately after Muslim was killed, Hani ibn Urwah as well was dragged to the roof top and executed.

Ibn Ziyad ordered [[Muqair Ibn Obran-e-Ahmari]] to take him to the palace's roof.&lt;ref name= Julius/&gt; They went to the top of the fortress, Muslim was decapitated in front of the people, his head was thrown down first and then followed by his body. Hani was also executed. They were executed in this way in order to intimidate the populace.&lt;ref name=Ayoub/&gt; Ibn Ziyad ordered that the bodies of these two men be dragged by their feet through the streets and marketplaces in Kufa. Muslim's body was then crucified upside down and the heads of Muslim and Hani were sent to Yazid to be displayed on the streets of Damascus.&lt;ref name=Brill/&gt;

Muslim bin Aqeel’s two sons, Mohammad and Ibrahim, were also killed in Kufa.

===Muslim is made a [[Shaheed]]===

Muslim called on the people of Kufa for assistance and narrations say that approximately 40,000 people accompanied him to the government building. By then, Ibn Ziyad had placed the leaders of Kufa on the roof top of the building and threatened to kill them if they did not leave Muslim bin Aqeel.

Within a short while, not one person from the 40,000 was with Muslim.

Muslim was later taken by the soldiers of Ibn Ziyaad and was martyred. Later, the two sons of Muslim were also martyred. These were two young children who accompanied their father, thinking that they were journeying to a place that was filled with true followers of the Ahle Bait.

===Husayn departs for Kufa===

On receiving the letter of Muslim, Hussain departed from Makkah and left for Kufa. When this group of the Ahlul Bayt left Makkah, every person and every child stood watching them with sadness as they left.

Their eyes filled with tears and their hearts heavy with sadness. On his way, he received news of the death of Muslim and his children. Hussain was also informed of the betrayal of the people of Kufa. He was very sad when he heard this news and read In'na lil'laahi Wa in'na ilaihi Raaji'oon. He then comforted the family members and gave them hope.

When the Ahlul Bayt reached a place called Thaa'lba, Hussain rested for a while. He awoke with tears in his eyes. His beloved sister, Zainab asked the reason for this, and he said, "I dreamt of our grandfather, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam. The Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam was crying and he said "O Hussain! You are soon to come and meet with me."

On hearing this, Ali Akbar the son of Hussain said, " O my dear father! Are we not on Haq (truth)?" Hussain replied, "verily we are on Haq and Haq is with us." Then Ali Akbar said, "why then should we fear death, O my father? We all must pass from this world one day. I am seeing the gardens of Shahaadat and a mansion better than that of the world and bounties even greater than that of this world are before us."

==Legacy==
While Muslim was not killed at [[Karbala]], he is counted as one of the martyrs of the battle.&lt;ref name=Ayoub/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorraj, Manochehr. "Symbolic nd Utilitarian Political Value of a Tradition: Martyrdom in the Iranian Political Culture" '''The Review of Politics'''. Summer 1997:511. JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shi'ite recommend visiting his grave in Kufa and there are certain prayers that are to be recited there.&lt;ref name=Islam/&gt;

On the other hand, there is the [[mausoleum]] of [[Ruqayyah bint Ali]] (Wife of Muslim ibn Aqeel) located in [[Lahore]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Bibi Pak Daman#cite note-ref93gifel-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Legend has it that it holds the graves of six ladies (one is Ruqqayah herself and others are Muslim's sisters) from [[Muhammad]]'s household ([[Ahl Al-Bayt]]).

Today, Muslim ibn Aqeel's descendants go by the surname "Uqaili" and are found in [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], and [[Iraq]].

'''Oyub Salmanovich Titiev''' ({{lang-ru|Оюб Салманович Титиев}}; born 24 August 1957, [[Lebedinovka]], Kyrgyz SSR, Soviet Union) is a Russian human rights activist and the head of [[Memorial_(society)|Memorial's]] [[Grozny|Grozny, Chechnya]] office. In 2018 he was arrested on politically-motivated charges, sparking an international campaign by human rights groups calling for his release. On 8 October 2018, Oyub Titiev was awarded the Václav Havel Human Rights Prize, which honours "outstanding" defence of human rights in Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://website-pace.net/web/apce/vaclav-havel-human-rights-prize|title=Václav Havel Human Rights Prize|website=website-pace.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Biography ==
Oyub Titiev’s ancestors were among the first settlers of the village Kurchaloi, Chechnya. However, as a result of the [[Deportation_of_the_Chechens_and_Ingush|deportation of Chechens in March 1944]] he was born in the village of Lebedinovka in the Kyrgyz SSR. He later returned to Kurchaloi, Chechnya. Active in wrestling and weightlifting, Titiev became a physical education teacher and created a local children's sports club, which has produced a number of professional athletes. 

Since 2000, he has worked for [https://www.memo.ru/en-us/ Memorial] and for the [https://refugee.ru/en/ Civic Assistance Committee], documenting human rights abuses in Chechnya and overseeing humanitarian projects such as assisting schools in Chechnya’s mountain regions or defending Muslims from discrimination in the criminal justice system. After the assassination of [[Natalya Estemirova]] in 1999, he became the head of Memorial in Chechnya.

== Arrest, detention and criminal case ==
On 9 January 2018 Oyub Titiev left Kurchaloi, traveling towards Mairtup, Chechnya, where he was supposed to meet a friend at 9:00 am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Human Rights Centre Memorial |url=https://memohrc.org/en/news_old/head-memorials-office-grozny-chechnya-detained |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official version, his Lada Kalina was stopped to verify his documents. Upon inspecting the car, the police officers found “a polymer bag with a substance of plant origin with the specific smell of marijuana, weighing approximately 180 grams.” Titiev was then detained and taken to the Kurchaloevsky police station for medical examination, while the packet with the substance was sent for expert analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rights Defender Arbitrarily Arrested in Chechnya |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/11/russia-rights-defender-arbitrarily-arrested-chechnya |website=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;. That same day, Memorial reported his detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chechnya moves to silence a courageous critic |url=https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/01/17/chechnya-moves-to-silence-oyub-titiev-a-courageous-critic |website=The Economist |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite web |title=Head of Grozny HRC Memorial was arrested |url=https://www.memo.ru/en-us/memorial/departments/intermemorial/news/110 |website=Memorial |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 2018, the Shalinsk city court arrested Titiev until March 9 on request of the investigator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oyub Titiev detained and facing criminal investigation |url=https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/oyub-titiev-detained-and-facing-criminal-investigation |website=Frontline Defenders |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The human rights activist was accused of breaking Part 2 Article 228 of the Criminal Code (the illegal acquisition, storage, and transportation of drugs)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ongoing judicial harassment and arbitrary detention of Mr. Oyub Titiev |url=https://www.fidh.org/en/issues/human-rights-defenders/russian-federation-ongoing-judicial-harassment-and-arbitrary |website=Worldwide Movement for Human Rights |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Titiev denied guilt and in a statement sent to the Investigatory Committee of the Chechen Republic accused the police officers of planting the illegal drugs under his passenger’s seat while inspecting his car&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pre-trial detention of Oyub Titiev confirmed in appeal hearing amid fears for his safety in detention |url=https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/oyub-titiev-detained-and-facing-criminal-investigation |website=Frontline Defenders |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On 12 January, his defense appealed the two-month arrest. 

Memorial representative Aleksandr Cherkasov said that Titiev’s arrest was related to his professional work which was “met with disapproval from Chechen authorities.” The representative of the [[Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights]], Mikhail Fedotov, said that the council had already appealed to the Ministry of Internal Affairs on January 10th to verify Titiev’s detention and investigate the situation.  

On 24 January, Aleksandr Cherkasov appealed to the Russian and international community on behalf of Memorial, urging them to closely monitor Titiev’s case as they had with criminal proceedings against historian and head of the Karelian branch of Memorial, [[Yury A. Dmitriev]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Address of the international Memorial to the Russian and international community (Russian) |url=https://echo.msk.ru/blog/shalommani/2135114-echo/ |website=Echo Moscow |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On January 28th, [[Ksenia Sobchak]], then a candidate in the [[Russian presidential election, 2018|March 2018 Russian Presidential Elections]], held a one-night-long picket in Grozny in “memory of journalists who died for a free country” with a poster reading “Freedom for Oyub Titiev.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sobchak complained to police about provocateurs in Grozny |url=http://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/42205/ |website=Caucasian Knot |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 1 February the [http://eng.ombudsmanrf.org/ High Commissioner for Human Rights in Russia], [[Tatyana Moskalkova]] called for the investigation of the Titiev case to be passed on to the federal level. A similar opinion was expressed by the representative of the [[Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights]], Mikhail Fedotov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The head of the HRC called the reasons for the transfer of Titiev's case |url=https://ria.ru/society/20180203/1513923046.html |website=RIA |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 6 March the Staropromyslov district court extended Titiev’s arrest until 9 May, while rejecting the ''poruchitelstvo'' (personal vouches, Russian: поручительство) he received from presidential candidates Grigory Yavlinsky and Kesnia Sobchak&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Human rights defender Oyub Titiev’s detention extended for two months |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/03/russia-human-rights-defender-oyub-titievs-detention-extended-for-two-months/ |website=Amnesty International |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

On 4 May, while considering an appeal to the ruling of the Staropromyslov district court, human rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina and test pilot and Hero of Russia Sergey Nefedov also offered a ''poruchitelstvo'' for Titiev, which the court also rejected&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Court leaves Chechen rights defender Oyub Titiev under arrest |url=http://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/43098/ |website=Caucasian Knot |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

A number of leading international human rights organizations, including [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Amnesty International]], [[Front Line Defenders]], [[FIDH]], the [[World Organization Against Torture]]) released a joint statement on 11 January, defending Titiev and Memorial’s activities in the Caucuses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rights Defender Arbitrarily Arrested in Chechnya |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/11/russia-rights-defender-arbitrarily-arrested-chechnya |website=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On 8 February, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on Oyub Titiev’s case calling for the "immediate release of the Director of the Memorial Human Rights Centre in the Chechen Republic, Mr Oyub Titiev"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Parliament resolution of 8 February on Russia, the case of Oyub Titiev and the Human Rights Centre Memorial |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;language=EN&amp;reference=P8-TA-2018-0034 |website=European Parliament |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Pauline Esther''' "'''Popo'''" '''Phillips'''  (née '''Friedman'''; July 4, 1918 – January 16, 2013), also known as '''Abigail Van Buren''', was an American [[advice columnist]] and [[Radio host|radio show host]] who began the ''[[Dear Abby]]'' column in 1956. During her decades writing the column, it became the most widely syndicated newspaper column in the world, syndicated in 1,400 newspapers with 110 million readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/17/showbiz/dear-abby-pauline-phillips-obit/index.html |title=Pauline Phillips, longtime Dear Abby advice columnist, dies at 94|work=CNN News|date= January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1963 to 1975, Phillips also hosted a daily ''Dear Abby'' program on CBS Radio. TV anchorwoman [[Diane Sawyer]] calls her the "pioneering queen of salty advice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sawyer, Diane |url= {{YouTube|UXa02kyJa28}}|title='Dear Abby' Columnist, Pauline Phillips, Dies at Age 94|work= ABC News|date= January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
'''Pauline Esther Friedman''', nicknamed "Popo", was born in [[Sioux City, Iowa]], to [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jewish]] immigrants, Rebecca (née Rushall) and Abraham B. Friedman, owner of a chain of movie theaters.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/business/media/pauline-phillips-flinty-adviser-to-millions-as-dear-abby-dies-at-94.html?emc=na&amp;_r=0 |title=Pauline Phillips, Flinty Adviser to Millions as Dear Abby, Dies at 94|work=The New York Times|date= January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the youngest of four sisters and grew up in Sioux City. Her identical twin, [[Eppie Lederer|Esther Pauline Friedman]] (married name Lederer), was columnist [[Ask Ann Landers|Ann Landers]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Lederer had become Ann Landers in 1955, and inspired by her sister's example, Phillips soon followed suit by launching her own advice column.

In describing her family's emigration to America, Phillips says, "My parents came with nothing. They all came with nothing." She adds that her parents never forgot first seeing the ''[[Statue of Liberty]]'':

{{quote|It's amazing the impact the lady of the harbor had on them. They always held her dear, all their lives.&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt;}}

Her sister, Esther, recalls their home life: "My father was the sort of man people came to for advice. My mother couldn't turn away anyone with a hard-luck story. Our house was always full of guests."&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; Phillips agrees, and understood that her parents had a clear effect on her own personality:

{{quote|I was cocky. My contemporaries would come to me for advice. I got that from my mother: the ability to listen and to help other people with their problems. I also got Daddy's sense of humor.&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt;}}

They are both alumnae of Central High School&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siouxcityhistory.org/sites/more.php?id=47_0_3_0_M |title=Central High School |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017054713/http://siouxcityhistory.org/sites/more.php?id=47_0_3_0_M |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sioux City and [[Morningside College]], where they both studied journalism and psychology, along with writing a joint gossip column for the college newspaper.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; They both played the violin. In July 1939, they were married in a double-wedding ceremony on July 2, two days before their 21st birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Eppie: The Story of Ann Landers, by Margo Howard (her daughter), p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ink"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jodyewing.com/jeanne_phillips_8_01.html |title=Daughter Helps Keep 'Abby' Ink Flowing |author=Ewing, Jody |date=August 23, 2001 |publisher=Ewing, Jody |accessdate=September 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61hdwpgBc?url=http://www.jodyewing.com/jeanne_phillips_8_01.html |archivedate=September 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pauline married Morton Phillips of [[Minneapolis]], and had two children, a son, Edward Jay Phillips, and a daughter, [[Jeanne Phillips]].&lt;ref name="Abby"/&gt;

In her July 8, 2017 ''Dear Abby'' column, Jeanne Phillips said her mother liked being a twin while her aunt wanted to be an individual, and this caused conflict between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/2017/7/8/twins-disagree-over-plan-to-go|title=Twins Disagree Over Plan to Go Their Separate Ways|last=Van Buren|first=Abigail|publisher=[[Uexpress]]|date=2017-07-08|accessdate=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Pauline's writing career that led to ''Dear Abby'' began in January 1956, when she was 37 and new to the greater San Francisco area.  Sometime during this period she phoned the editor of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and said she could write a better advice column than the one she had been reading in the newspaper.&lt;ref name="Abby"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCNews/&gt; After hearing her modest credentials, editor Stanleigh "Auk" Arnold gave her some letters in need of answers and said to bring back her replies in a week; Phillips got her replies back to the ''Chronicle'' in an hour and half. In an interview with [[Larry King]], she said she had no work experience, lacking even a social security number. The editor, however, asked if she were a professional writer. He said her writing was "fabulous', and she was hired that day.&lt;ref name="Abby"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;video interview: {{YouTube|akk_67S3DUk|"'Dear Abby' talks about her big break"}}, CNN&lt;/ref&gt;

She went by the pen name [[Abigail Van Buren]], after the [[Old Testament]] prophetess from the [[Book of Samuel]]: ''Then David said to Abigail ... 'Blessed is your advice and blessed are you.''&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; "Van Buren" was used after the president, [[Martin Van Buren]].&lt;ref name="Ander"&gt;{{cite news |title=At 72, 'Dear Abby' Says Retirement Is A Dirty Word |author=Ander, Marsha S. |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/s/InfoWeb/aggdocs/AWNB/0EB04D391BB2E2F9/0D0CB57AB53DF815 |newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=June 8, 1991 |accessdate=2011-09-14 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61hknl0Nb?url=http://iw.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_theme=aggdocs&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_sort=YMD_date%3AD&amp;p_product=AWNB&amp;p_docid=0EB04D391BB2E2F9&amp;p_text_direct-0=document_id%3D%28%200EB04D391BB2E2F9%20%29&amp;p_nbid=R51I4CYCMTMxNjA0ODI3NS44MTA1OTI6MTo5OjEyOC |archivedate=September 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillips says that because she applied for the columnist job without notifying her sister first, it created bad feelings between them for many years. Each wrote her own advice column, and as competing columnists, they sometimes clashed; in 1956, Phillips offered her column to the ''[[Sioux City Journal]]'' at a reduced price, provided the paper refused to print her sister's column.&lt;ref name="Ink"/&gt; The sisters ostensibly reconciled in 1964, but remained competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Landers.html|first=Robin|last=Judd|title=Ann Landers biography |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, after only two years writing their columns, they became "the most widely read and most quoted women in the world," according to [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine.&lt;ref name=Life&gt;''Life'' magazine, April 7, 1958 pp. 102–112&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing style===
Although newspapers had included gossip and personal columnists for over a century, the two sisters added "something special," writes ''Life'', in that they were the first to publish letters and their replies covering a wide range of personal problems. From as many as 9,000 letters in a single week in their initial years, they responded with answers to people from all walks of life, including doctors, lawyers, and clergymen, as well as from pregnant teenagers, harassed husbands, unwed mothers, alcoholics, gays, and mistresses.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; Setting their column apart even more from columnists of earlier decades was their particular style of writing, replying with "vaudeville punch lines" yet always rooted in common sense.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; Phillips is described thusly by the ''New York Times'':

{{quote|With her comic and flinty yet fundamentally sympathetic voice, Mrs. Phillips helped wrestle the advice column from its weepy Victorian past into a hard-nosed 20th-century present.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;}}

Phillips was considered liberal minded politically, yet personally conservative. She remained reluctant to advise unmarried couples to live together, for instance, until the 1990s, yet she adapted readily to social changes.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; One example:

{{quote|
'''Dear Abby:''' Our daughter-in-law was married in January. Five months later she had a nine pound baby girl. She said the baby was premature. Tell me, can a baby this big be that early? ''Wondering''

'''Dear Wondering:''' The baby was on time. The wedding was late. Forget it.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;}}

Both Phillips and her sister were considered remarkable women soon after starting their careers, recognized for being bright and entertaining, and writing with "an earthy wit, audacity and awesome self-confidence," often exemplified in Phillips' "crackling one-liners."&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; The editor of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' described their skill as "beyond mere shrewdness—a quality very close to genuine wisdom."&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; [[Amy Dickinson]], a syndicated advice columnist who styles her columns after ''Dear Abby,'' says that  Phillips was a "master" in her ability to write with both "genuine honesty" and "compassion," while at the same time being able to respond with "tough love" when needed:&lt;ref&gt;video interview: {{YouTube|O212Y2yuogU|"Remembering Pauline Phillips, 'Dear Abby'"}}, ''PBS Newshour'' interview with [[Amy Dickinson]], January 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
'''Dear Abby:''' What is the cure for a man that has been married for 33 years and still can't stay away from other women? ''His Wife''

'''Dear Wife:''' Rigor mortis.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;}}

{{quote|
'''Dear Abby:''' Which is better? To go to a school dance with a creep or to sit home?  ''All Shook Up''

'''Dear Shook:''' Go with the creep, and look over the crop.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;}}

The letters that Phillips and her sister each picked for publication were meant to give the public glimpses of "the most intimate of human difficulties," which contributed to their immediate acceptance. ''Life'' magazine explains:

{{quote|This careful selectivity, together with their own brevity, understanding and the abrasive humor of the answers, has earned the twins a phenomenal following of readers, even among people with no important problems of their own. They are discussed at the country club bridge table and the faculty tea, as well as in the beauty parlor, and are read by men as well as by women.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;}}

Phillips stated that the most sensitive letters she received were never published, but were instead replied to individually. Sometimes she would write a brief note on the letter itself, letting one of her secretaries respond fully using her advice. If a person seemed suicidal from their letter, she would call them on the phone.&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt; As noted by ''Life'':

{{quote|The most demanding of the problems never reach their columns. Homosexuals, people in mortal fear that their minds are slipping, women in terror of sex aberrants, wives afraid of brutal husbands, sinning clergymen—all write without reticence, asking for help. Both sisters write personal letters to these unfortunates. In some cases they rush telegraphic advice.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;}}

===Public relations===
As part of their work both sisters engaged with other editors, publishers, and the general public whenever they could. "Neither ever forgets a name," and they were uninhibited public speakers: they "whirl around the country appearing on radio and television and—dressed like visiting movie actresses—holding thousands of housewives spellbound in speeches at theaters and auditoriums."&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;

==Personal life and beliefs==
Like her sister, Phillips was considered "the embodiment of female orthodoxy." They made their husbands and families a high priority in their lives, feeling that "marriage must be permanent, even when disturbed by masculine lunacy." Phillips typically spoke in glowing terms about her husband in public, calling him "loveboat" or smooching with him in restaurants. This attitude carried over into their columns in the late 1950s, with Phillips considering women who were unable to make their marriages work as "faintly ridiculous." Her "code of conduct" was "husband and children first."&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; In her later years, she did not avoid suggesting divorce when a relationship became "intolerable", and considered how a bad marriage might affect children: "When kids see parents fighting, or even sniping at each other, I think it is terribly damaging."&lt;ref name=chronicle&gt;{{cite news|url= http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/458541-dear-abby-advice-columnist-sister-of-ann-landers-dies-at-94 |title=Dear Abby, advice columnist, sister of Ann Landers, dies at 94|work=The Chronicle Herald|location= Canada|date= January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dear Abby.jpg|thumb|240px|with [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Dean Martin]]]] --&gt;
Both Phillips and her sister enjoyed socializing with celebrities, and because of their notoriety, celebrities liked being seen with either of them. Among Phillips' friends soon after she began her column were politicians, including Senators [[Hubert Humphrey]] and [[Herbert Lehman]]; and entertainers, including [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Dean Martin]].&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;

They also admired Bishop [[Fulton Sheen]], whom they met when learning about Catholicism while studying about other religions. The bishop admired them both in return due to their ability to remain "unawed" and unaffected by the fame of others. Phillips, who was Jewish, commented: "He's one of the greatest men I ever met, but he'll be a Jew before I'm a Catholic."&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; Phillips and Bishop Sheen corresponded often and she recalls their letters:

{{quote|When we correspond, he ends his letters, "God love you, Yours in Christ." I end mine, "God love YOU, Daughter of Isaac, Abraham and Jacob."&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;}}

Phillips was an honorary member of [[Women in Communications]], the [[American College of Psychiatrists]], and the [[National Council of Jewish Women]]. She authored six books:  ''Dear Abby'', ''Dear Teenager'', ''Dear Abby on Marriage'', ''Where Were You When President Kennedy was Shot?'', ''The Dear Abby Wedding Planner'', and ''The Best of Dear Abby''. ''The Dear Abby Show'' aired on the [[CBS Radio Network]] for 12 years.&lt;ref name="ups"&gt;Universal Press Syndicate historical files.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked near the end of her career whether her years of writing the column were a lot of work, she said, "It's only work if you'd rather be doing something else." She felt that her career had been "fulfilling, exciting and incredibly rewarding."&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt;

After some point in life Phillips stopped driving. Her daughter Jeanne said, "She quit after skidding into the back of a coal truck during a Wisconsin winter," with Jeanne having a life-long scar from the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/2018/3/19/1/family-ridicules-woman-who-never-learned|title=Family Ridicules Woman Who Never Learned To Drive|last=Phillips|first=Jeanne|date=2018-03-19|website=Dear Abby via uexpress|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Goldblatt''' (born 1943) is a [[South African]] [[botanist]], working principally in the United States.

== Life ==
Goldblatt was born in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa on October 8, 1943. His undergraduate studies (B.Sc.) were undertaken at the [[University of Witwatersrand]] in Johannesberg (1965–1966), from where he went on to graduate studies at the [[University of Cape Town]], where he received his doctorate in 1970. He held a position as lecturer in botany at Witwatersrand (1967) and then Cape Town (1968–1971) before emigrating to the United States in 1972. In the US he took up a position as a researcher at the [[Missouri Botanical Gardens]], in [[St. Louis]], where he has remained since, holding the position of Senior Curator since 1990. He returned briefly to South Africa in 2006 as a researcher at the [[Compton Herbarium]], South African National Biodiversity Institute, in Cape Town. He has also held appointments at the [[University of Missouri]], as well as the [[University of Portland]], [[Oregon]] (2000–2004). He obtained US citizenship in 1978.{{sfn|Goldblatt|2016a}}{{sfn|Goldblatt|2016b}}{{sfn|Gunn|Codd|1981|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=mkfdQ3l1YQUC&amp;pg=PA169 p.&amp;nbsp;169]}}

== Work ==
Peter Goldblatt started his career as a plant collector in 1962, and worked extensively in [[Cape Province]], but also in other regions of Africa, Madagascar, the United States, Greece, Italy, Israel, Turkey and Iran, having collected thousands of specimens. His interests lie in systematic [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].{{sfn|Goldblatt|1995}} One of his main research interests has been the cytology and taxonomy of the [[Iridaceae]] of Africa.{{sfn|Goldblatt|2016a}}{{sfn|Goldblatt|2016b}}{{sfn|Gunn|Codd|1981|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=mkfdQ3l1YQUC&amp;pg=PA169 p.&amp;nbsp;169]}}  A member of several botanical societies, he was also General Secretary (1982–1985) of the Association for the Taxonomic Study of Tropical African Flora.{{sfn|HUH|2015}}{{sfn|Tropicos|2015}}

In 1999 he was awarded the [[International Bulb Society]]'s [[Herbert Medal]] for his contributions to the knowledge of [[bulb|bulbous plants]].{{sfn|Timber Press|2016}}

'''Phanariotes''', '''Phanariots''', or '''Phanariote Greeks''' ({{lang-el|Φαναριώτες}}, {{lang-ro|Fanarioți}}, {{lang-tr|Fenerliler}}) were members of prominent [[Greeks|Greek]] families in [[Fener|Phanar]]&lt;ref name="BritB"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica,''Phanariote'', 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; (Φανάρι, modern ''Fener''),&lt;ref&gt;The names [[Fener]] and Φανάρι (''Fanari'') derive from the Greek nautical word meaning "[[Lighthouse]]" (literary "lantern" or "lamp")&lt;br&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.komvos.edu.gr/dictonlineplsql/simple_search.display_full_lemma?the_lemma_id=15948&amp;target_dict=1 | title=''Τριανταφυλλίδης On line Dictionary'' | work=Φανάρι (ναυτ.) |accessdate= October 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the chief Greek quarter of [[Constantinople]] where the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]] is located, who traditionally occupied four important positions in the [[Ottoman Empire]]: Grand [[Dragoman]], Grand [[Dragoman]] of the Fleet, [[Hospodar of Moldavia]], and [[Hospodar of Wallachia]]. Despite their cosmopolitanism and often-Western education, the Phanariotes were aware of their [[Hellenization|Hellenism]]; according to [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]]' ''Philotheou Parerga'', "We are a race completely Hellenic".&lt;ref&gt;Mavrocordatos Nicholaos, ''Philotheou Parerga'', J.Bouchard, 1989, p.178, citation: Γένος μεν ημίν των άγαν Ελλήνων&lt;/ref&gt;

They emerged as a class of moneyed Greek merchants (of mostly noble [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] descent) during the second half of the 16th century, and were influential in the administration of the Ottoman Empire's Balkan domains in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="BritB"/&gt; The Phanariotes usually built their houses in the Phanar quarter to be near the court of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]], who (under the Ottoman [[millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]] system) was recognized as the spiritual and secular head (''millet-bashi'') of the [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] subjects—the [[Rum Millet]], or "Roman nation" of the empire, except those under the spiritual care of the patriarchs of Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Ohrid and Peć—often acting as [[archons of the Ecumenical Patriarchate|archontes of the Ecumenical See]]. They dominated the administration of the patriarchate, often intervening in the selection of [[hierarch]]s (including the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople).

==Overview==
Many members of Phanariot families (who had acquired great wealth and influence during the 17th century) occupied high [[State organisation of the Ottoman Empire|political and administrative posts]] in the Ottoman Empire. From 1669 until the Greek War of Independence in 1821, Phanariotes made up the majority of the [[dragoman]]s to the Ottoman government (the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]) and foreign [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]] due to the Greeks' higher level of education than the general Ottoman population.&lt;ref name=BritA&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, The Phanariotes, 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; With the church dignitaries, local notables from the provinces and the large Greek merchant class, Phanariotes represented the better-educated members of Greek society during Ottoman rule until the 1821 start of the [[Greek War of Independence]]. During the war, Phanariotes influenced decisions by the [[Greek national assemblies|Greek National Assembly]] (the representative body of Greek revolutionaries, which met six times between 1821 and 1829).&lt;ref name=BritA/&gt;&lt;ref name="Papar108"/&gt; Between 1711–1716 and 1821, a number of Phanariotes were appointed [[Hospodar]]s ([[voivode]]s or princes) in the [[Danubian Principalities]] ([[Moldavia]] and Wallachia) (usually as a promotion from dragoman offices); the period is known as the Phanariote epoch in Romanian history.&lt;ref name=BritB/&gt;

==Ottoman Empire==
After the [[fall of Constantinople]], [[Mehmet II]] deported the city's Christian population, leaving only the Jewish inhabitants of [[Balat, Fatih|Balat]],&lt;ref name=ma98&gt;Mamboury (1953), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; repopulating the city with Christians and Muslims from throughout the whole empire and the newly conquered territories.&lt;ref name=ma98/&gt; Phanar was repopulated with Greeks from Mouchlion in the [[Peloponnese]] and, [[Trabzon#Ancient and medieval|after 1461]], with citizens of [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]].&lt;ref name=ma99&gt;Mamboury (1953), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of Greek ascendancy can be traced to the Ottoman need for skilled, educated negotiators as their empire declined and they relied on treaties rather than force.&lt;ref name=BritB/&gt; During the 17th century, the Ottomans began having problems in foreign relations and difficulty dictating terms to their neighbours; for the first time, the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] needed to participate in diplomatic negotiations.

With the Ottomans traditionally ignoring Western European languages and cultures, officials were at a loss.&lt;ref name="Stavrianos" /&gt; The Porte assigned those tasks to the Greeks, who had a long mercantile and educational tradition and the necessary skills. The Phanariotes, Greek and Hellenized families primarily from [[Constantinople]], occupied high posts as secretaries and interpreters for Ottoman officials.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawm"/&gt;

==={{anchor|Diplomats and Patriarchs}}Diplomats and patriarchs===
As a result of Phanariote and ecclesiastical administration, the Greeks expanded their influence in the 18th-century empire while retaining their [[Greek Orthodox]] faith and Hellenism. This had not always been the case in the Ottoman realm. During the 16th century, the [[South Slavs]]—the most prominent in imperial affairs—converted to [[Islam]] to enjoy the full rights of Ottoman citizenship (especially in the [[Eyalet of Bosnia]]; Serbs tended to occupy high military positions.&lt;ref name="Stavrianos"&gt;Stavrianos, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

A Slavic presence in Ottoman administration gradually became hazardous for its rulers, since the Slavs tended to support [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] armies during the [[Great Turkish War]]. By the 17th century the Greek Patriarch of Constantinople was the religious and administrative ruler of the empire's Orthodox subjects, regardless of ethnic background. All formerly-independent Orthodox patriarchates, including the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Patriarchate]] renewed in 1557, came under the authority of the Greek Orthodox Church.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawm"&gt;Hobsbawm pp. 181–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Greek patriarchs were drawn from the Phanariotes.

Two Greek social groups emerged, challenging the leadership of the Greek Church:&lt;ref name="Svoronos87"&gt;Svoronos, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; the Phanariotes in [[Constantinople]] and the local notables in the [[Ottoman Greece|Helladic provinces]] (''[[kodjabashis]]'', ''dimogerontes'' and ''prokritoi''). According to 19th-century Greek historian [[Constantine Paparrigopoulos]], the Phanariotes initially sought the most important secular offices of the patriarchical court and could frequently intervene in the election of bishops and influence crucial decisions by the patriarch.&lt;ref name="Papar108"&gt;Paparregopoulus, Eb, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek merchants and clergy of [[Byzantine]] aristocratic origin, who acquired economic and political influence and were later known as Phanariotes, settled in extreme northwestern Constantinople (which had become central to Greek interests after the establishment of the patriarch's headquarters in 1461, shortly after [[Hagia Sophia]] was converted into a mosque).&lt;ref name="Svoronos88"&gt;Svoronos, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Byzantine eagle.JPG|thumb|alt=Double-headed eagle on a building|Emblem of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]]]]

====Patriarchate====
After the 1453 fall of Constantinople, when the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] replaced ''[[de jure]]'' the [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine emperor]] for subjugated Christians, he recognized the Ecumenical Patriarch as the religious and national leader (''[[ethnarch]]'') of the Greeks and other ethnic groups in the Greek Orthodox ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet]]''.&lt;ref name="glenny"&gt;Glenny, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The Patriarchate had primary importance, occupying this key role for Christians of the Empire because the Ottomans did not legally distinguish between nationality and religion and considered the empire's [[Orthodox Christians]] a single entity.&lt;ref name="Svoronos83"&gt;Svoronos, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of the Patriarchate in the Ottoman state encouraged Greek renaissance projects centering on the resurrection and revitalization of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Patriarch and his church dignitaries constituted the first centre of power for the Greeks in the Ottoman state, which infiltrated Ottoman structures and attracted the former Byzantine nobility.&lt;ref name="Svoronos83" /&gt;

===Merchant middle class===
[[File:Greek merchant 16th century (cropped).JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=Bearded man in a robe|Engraving of Greek merchant by [[Cesare Vecellio]] (16th century)]]

The wealth of the extensive Greek merchant class provided the material basis for the intellectual revival featured in Greek life for more than half a century before 1821. Greek merchants endowed libraries and schools. On the eve of the Greek War of Independence, the three most important centres of Greek learning (schools-cum-universities) were in the commercial centres of [[Chios]], [[Smyrna]] and [[Aivali]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Greek history, The mercantile middle class'', 2008 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Greek millionaire of the Ottoman era was [[Michael Kantakouzenos Şeytanoğlu|Michael "Şeytanoğlu" Kantakouzenos]], who earned 60,000 [[ducat]]s a year from his control of the fur trade from [[Muscovy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Runciman]].

===Civil servants===
During the 18th century, the Phanariotes were a hereditary clerical−aristocratic group who managed the affairs of the patriarchate and the dominant political power of the Ottoman Greek community. They became a significant political factor in the empire and, as diplomatic agents, played a role in the affairs of Great Britain, France and the Russian Empire.&lt;ref name="Svoronos89"&gt;Svoronos, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Phanariotes competed for the most important administrative offices in the Ottoman administration; these included collecting imperial taxes, monopolies on commerce, working under contract in a number of enterprises, supplying the court and ruling the [[Danubian Principalities]] (Moldavia and Wallachia). They engaged in private trade, controlling the crucial wheat trade on the [[Black Sea]]. The Phanariotes expanded their commercial activities into the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and then to the other Central European states. Their activities intensified their contacts with Western nations, and they became familiar with Western languages and cultures.&lt;ref name="Svoronos88"&gt;Svoronos, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, the Phanariotes were firmly established as the political elite of Hellenism. According to Greek historian Constantine Paparrigopoulos, this was a natural evolution given the Phanariotes' education and experience in supervising large parts of the empire.&lt;ref name="Papar108" /&gt; According to Nikos Svoronos argued, the Phanariotes subordinated their [[national identity]] to their [[Social class|class identity]] and tried to peacefully co−exist with the Ottomans; they did not enrich the Greek national identity and lost ground to groups which flourished through their confrontation with the Ottoman Empire (the ''[[klepht]]s'' and ''[[armatoloi]]'').&lt;ref name="Svoronos91"&gt;Svoronos, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Greek presence had established itself in both provinces, resulting in the appointment of Greek princes before the 18th century. After the Phanariote era, families of Phanariote ancestry in Wallachia and Moldavia identified themselves as [[Romanians|Romanian]] in [[Romania]]n society (including the Rosetti family; [[C. A. Rosetti]] represented the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|radical]], nationalist cause during and after the [[1848 Wallachian revolution]].

Phanariote attention focused on occupying the most favorable offices the empire could offer non-Muslims and the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, which were still relatively rich and—more importantly—autonomous (despite having to pay tribute as [[vassal]] states). Many Greeks had found favorable conditions there for commercial activities, in comparison with the Ottoman Empire, and an opportunity for political power; they entered Wallachian and Moldavian [[boyar]] nobility by marriage.

Reigns of local princes were not excluded on principle. Several [[Hellenization|hellenized]] Romanian noble families, such as the [[Callimachi]]s (originally ''Călmașul''), the [[Ghica]]s or the [[Racoviță]]s, penetrated the Phanar nucleus to increase their chances of occupying the thrones and maintain their positions.

Most sources agree that 1711 was when the gradual erosion of traditional institutions reached its zenith, but characteristics ascribed to the Phanariote era had made themselves felt long before it.&lt;ref&gt;See the historiographical discussion in Drace-Francis, ''The Making of Modern Romanian Culture'', p. 26, note 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans enforced their choice of [[hospodar]]s as far back as the 15th century, and foreign (usually Greek or [[Levant]]ine) [[boyar]]s competed with local ones since the late 16th century. Rulers since Dumitraşcu [[Cantacuzino]] in Moldavia and [[George Ducas]] (a prince of Greek origin) in Wallachia, both in 1673, were forced to surrender their family members as hostages in Constantinople. The traditional [[Elective monarchy|elective system]] in the principalities, resulting in long periods of political disorder, was dominated by a small number of ambitious families who competed violently for the two thrones and monopolized land ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 123, 125–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1711–1715===
[[File:Stavropoleos Preziosi.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Building with pillars and people outside|[[Stavropoleos Monastery|Stavropoleos Church]], built in [[Bucharest]] by [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]], in an 1868 [[lithograph]] by [[Amedeo Preziosi]]]]

A change in policy was indicated by the fact that autonomous Wallachia and Moldavia had entered a period of skirmishes with the Ottomans, due to the insubordination of local princes associated with the rise of [[Imperial Russia]]'s power under [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and the firm presence of the Habsburg Empire on the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] border with the principalities. Dissidence in the two countries became dangerous for the Turks, who were confronted with the attraction on the population of protection by a fellow [[Eastern Orthodox]] state. This became obvious with [[Mihai Racoviță]]'s second rule in Moldavia, when the prince plotted with Peter to have Ottoman rule overthrown. His replacement, [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]], was the first official Phanariote in his second reign in Moldavia and replaced [[Ștefan Cantacuzino]] in Wallachia as the first Phanariote ruler of that country.

A crucial moment was the [[Russo-Turkish War (1710–1711)|Russo−Turkish War]] of 1710−1713, when [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] sided with Russia and agreed to Russian tutelage of his country. After Russia experienced a major defeat and Cantemir went into exile, the Ottomans took charge of the succession to the throne of Moldavia. This was followed by similar measures in Wallachia, prompted by [[Ștefan Cantacuzino]]'s alliance with Habsburg commander [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] in the closing stages of the [[Great Turkish War]].

===Rulers and retinues===
[[File:Mavrogheni trasura cerbi.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Painting of people traveling on horseback and in a carriage drawn by stags|Phanariotes in [[Wallachia]]. The caption reads: "Flight of [[Nicholas Mavrogenes|Prince Mavrogeni]] from [[Bucharest]] while ''[[k.u.k.]]'' troops approach&amp;nbsp;/ 9 Nov[ember] 1789".]]

The person raised to the office of prince was usually the chief [[dragoman]] of the Porte, well-versed in contemporary politics and Ottoman statecraft. The new prince, who obtained his office in exchange for a generous bribe, proceeded to the country he was selected to govern (whose language he usually did not know). When the new princes were appointed, they were escorted to [[Iași]] or [[Bucharest]] by retinues composed of their families, favourites and creditors (from whom they had borrowed the bribes). The prince and his appointees counted on recouping these in as short a time as possible, amassing an amount sufficient to live on after their brief time in office.

Thirty-one princes, from eleven families, ruled the two principalities during the Phanariote epoch. When the choice became limited to a few families due to princely disloyalty to the Porte, rulers would be moved from one principality to the other; the prince of Wallachia (the richer of the two principalities) would pay to avert his transfer to Iaşi, and the prince of Moldavia would bribe supporters in Constantinople to appoint him to Wallachia. [[Constantine Mavrocordatos]] ruled a total of ten times in [[Moldavia]] and Wallachia. The debt was owed to several creditors, rather than to the Sultan; the central institutions of the Ottoman Empire generally seemed determined to maintain their rule over the principalities and not exploit them irrationally. In an early example, [[Ahmed III]] paid part of [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]]' sum.

===Administration and boyars===
[[File:Alexandru Moruzi at Curtea Nouă.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of two statesmen on a couch, surrounded by other men|[[Alexander Mourousis]] welcoming the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] ambassador in [[Curtea Nouă]]]]

The Phanariote epoch was initially characterized by fiscal policies driven by Ottoman needs and the ambitions of some hospodars, who (mindful of their fragile status) sought to pay back their creditors and increase their wealth while in a position of power. To make the reigns lucrative while raising funds to satisfy the needs of the Porte, princes channeled their energies into taxing the inhabitants into destitution. The most odious taxes (such as the  ''[[Historical Romanian taxes|văcărit]]'' first imposed by [[Iancu Sasul]] in the 1580s), mistakenly identified with the Phanariotes in modern Romanian historiography, were much older.

The mismanagement of many Phanariote rulers contrasts with the achievements and projects of others, such as Constantine Mavrocordatos (who abolished [[serfdom]] in Wallachia in 1746 and  Moldavia in 1749) and [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1725–1805)|Alexander Ypsilantis]], who were inspired by Habsburg serf policy. Ypsilantis tried to reform legislation and impose salaries for administrative offices in an effort to halt the depletion of funds the administrators, local and Greek alike, were using for their own maintenance; it was, by then, more profitable to hold office than to own land. His ''Pravilniceasca condică'', a relatively-modern [[legal code]], met stiff [[boyar]] resistance.

The focus of such rules was often the improvement of state structure against conservative wishes. Contemporary documents indicate that, despite the change in leadership and boyar complaints, about 80 percent of those seated in the [[Sfatul boieresc|Divan]] (an institution roughly equivalent to the [[estates of the realm]]) were members of local families.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.124&lt;/ref&gt; This made endemic the social and economic issues of previous periods, since the inner circle of boyars blocked initiatives (such as Alexander Ypsilantis') and obtained, extended and preserved [[tax exemption]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russian influence ==
The Phanariotes copied Russian and Habsburg institutions; during the mid-18th century they made noble rank dependent on state service, as [[Peter I of Russia]] did. After the [[Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji]] (1774) allowed Russia to intervene on the side of Ottoman Eastern Orthodox subjects, most of the Porte's tools of political pressure became ineffective. They had to offer concessions to maintain a hold on the countries as economic and strategic assets. The treaty made any increase in tribute impossible, and between 1774 and the 1820s it plummeted from about 50,000 to 20,000 [[gold coin]]s (equivalent to [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|Austrian gold currency]]) in Wallachia and to 3,100 in Moldavia.&lt;ref&gt;Berza&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexandros Mourouzis.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Portrait of a bearded man with a hat|[[Alexander Mourousis]]]]

Immediately afterward, Russia forcefully used its new prerogative. The deposition of [[Constantine Ypsilantis]] (in Wallachia) and [[Alexander Mourousis]] (in Moldavia) by [[Selim III]], called on by [[First French Empire|French Empire]]'s [[French Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire|ambassador to the Ottoman Empire]] [[Horace François Bastien, baron Sébastiani|Horace Sébastiani]] (whose fears of pro−Russian [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracies]] in Bucharest were partially confirmed), was the ''[[casus belli]]'' for the 1806–1812 conflict, and Russian general [[Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich]] swiftly reinstated Ypsilantis during his military expedition to Wallachia.

Such gestures began a period of effective Russian supervision, culminating with the [[Regulamentul Organic|Organic Statute]] administration of the 1830s. The Danubian principalities grew in strategic importance with the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]], as European states became interested in halting [[Russian history, 1796–1855|Russian southward expansion]] (which included the 1812 annexation of [[Bessarabia]]). New [[Consul (representative)|consulates]] in the two countries' capitals, ensuring the observation of developments in Russian−Ottoman relations, had an indirect impact on the local economy as rival diplomats began awarding protection and ''[[sudiţi|sudit]]'' status to merchants competing with local [[guild]]s. [[Nicholas I of Russia]] pressured Wallachia and Moldavia into granting constitutions (in 1831 and 1832, respectively) to weaken native rulers.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Balkans 1804-1945, page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[boyars]] began a petition campaign against the princes in power; addressed to the Porte and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], they primarily demanded Russian supervision. Although they referred to incidents of [[political corruption|corruption]] and misrule, the petitions indicate their signers' conservatism. The boyars tend to refer to (fictitious) "[[Capitulations (Ottoman)|capitulations]]" which either principality would have signed with the Ottomans, demanding that rights guaranteed through them be restored.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.123&lt;/ref&gt; They viewed reform attempts by princes as illegitimate; in alternative proposals (usually in the form of constitutional projects), the boyars expressed desire for an [[Mixed government|aristocratic republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.319&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek war of independence and legacy==
[[File:Alexander2.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Portrait of a balding man with a handlebar mustache|[[Alexandros Ypsilantis]] (1792–1828), prince of the [[Danubian Principalities]], senior [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] cavalry officer during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and leader of the [[Filiki Eteria]], commanded the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Revolution]] in [[Wallachia]] and planned a pan-Balkan uprising.]]
[[File:Mavrokordatos1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Portrait of an older, mustachioed man|[[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]] (1791–1865), a leader of the [[Greek War of Independence]] and first [[List of Prime Ministers of Greece|President of the Provisional Administration of Greece]] (1822–1823)]]

The active part taken by Greek princes in revolts after 1820 and the disorder provoked by the [[Filiki Eteria]] (of which the [[Ghica family|Ghica]], [[Văcărescu family|Văcărescu]] and Golescu families were active members&lt;ref&gt;Alex Drace-Francis, ''The Making of Modern Romanian Culture: Literacy and the Development of National Identity'', p.87, 2006, I.B.Tauris, {{ISBN|1-84511-066-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; after its uprising against the Ottoman Empire in Moldavia and [[Tudor Vladimirescu]]'s [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|Wallachian uprising]]) led to the disappearance of promotions from the [[Phanar]] community; the Greeks were no longer trusted by the Porte. Amid tense relations between boyars and princes, Vladimirescu's revolt was primarily the result of compromise between [[Oltenia]]n [[pandurs]] and the [[Regent|regency]] of boyars attempting to block the ascension of [[Scarlat Callimachi (hospodar)|Scarlat Callimachi]] (the last Phanariote ruler in Bucharest).&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ioan Sturdza]]'s rule in Moldavia and [[Grigore IV Ghica]]'s in Wallachia are considered the first of the new period, although the new regime abruptly ended in Russian occupation during another [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|Russo−Turkish War]] and the subsequent period of Russian influence.

Most Phanariotes were patrons of [[Greek culture]], education and printing. They founded academies which attracted teachers and pupils from throughout the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] commonwealth, and there was awareness of intellectual trends in [[Habsburg]] Europe.&lt;ref name=BritB/&gt; Many of the Phanariote princes were capable, farsighted rulers. As prince of Walachia in 1746 and Moldavia in 1749, [[Constantin Mavrocordat]] abolished serfdom and [[Alexandru Ipsilanti]] of Walachia (reigned 1774–1782) initiated extensive administrative and legal reforms. Ipsilanti's reign coincided with subtle shifts in economic and social life and the emergence of spiritual and intellectual aspirations which pointed to the West and reform.&lt;ref name=BritC&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica,''History of Romania, Romania Between Turkey and Austria'',2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Condemnation of the Phanariotes is a focus of [[Romania]]n nationalism, usually integrated into a general resentment of foreigners. The tendency unifies pro− and anti−modernisation attitudes; Phanariote Greeks are painted as reactionary elements (by [[Communist Romania]]) and agents of brutal, opportunistic change (as in [[Mihai Eminescu]]'s ''Scrisoarea a III-a'').

'''Raja Ali Haji bin Raja Haji Ahmad''' (1808&amp;ndash;1873) was a 19th-century [[Bugis people|Buginese]]&amp;ndash;[[Malay people|Malay]] historian, poet and scholar.&lt;ref name="KellyBoyd"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' (1999), pg 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;
He was elevated to the status of [[National Hero of Indonesia]] in 2004.

==Early life==
Raja Ali Haji was born in [[Selangor]] (although some sources stated that he was born in Penyengat)&lt;ref name="AryaA"/&gt; in 1808 or 1809,&lt;ref name="Al-nafis"&gt;''The Precious Gift: Tuhfat Al-nafis'' (1982), pg 5&lt;/ref&gt; and was the son of Raja Ahmad, who was titled Engku Haji Tua after accomplishing the pilgrimage to Mecca. He was the grandson of Raja Ali Haji Fisabilillah (the brother of Raja Lumu, the first Sultan of Selangor).&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of Modern Malaya: A History from Earliest Times to the Present'' (1963), pg 69&lt;/ref&gt; Fisabilillah was a scion of the [[Sultanate of Riau|royal house of Riau]], who were descended from Bugis warriors who came to the region in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;The Precious Gift: Tuhfat Al-nafis (1982), pg 277&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Encik Hamidah binti Malik was a cousin of her father and also of [[Bugis people|Bugis]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;''The World's Religions'' (1988), pg 42&lt;/ref&gt; Raji Ali Haji soon relocated to Penyengat as an infant, where he grew up and received his education there.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society'' (1994), pg 29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pulau Penyengat 3.jpg|thumb|Raja Ali Haji's tomb on [[Penyengat Island]].]]

==Death==
Most sources stated that Raja Ali Haji died in 1872 at Penyengat Island&lt;ref name="AryaA"&gt;''Mengenal Pahlawan Indonesia'', Ajisaka, pg 219&lt;/ref&gt; in Riau, but the date of his death was being debated as scattered evidences surfaced to oppose this claim. Among the best-known evidences was a letter written in 1872 when Raja Ali Haji wrote a letter to Herman Von De Wall, a Dutch cultural expert, who later died at [[Tanjung Pinang]] in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;''Contesting Malayness: Malay Identity Across Boundaries'' (2004), pg 128&lt;/ref&gt;

'''R. Randolph Brinson''' (born 1957)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albme.org/Default.aspx?Page=LicenseeDetails&amp;ID=11349 Alabama Board of Medical Examiners: Licensee search-Robert Randolph Brinson]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a political activist and physician sub-specializing in [[gastroenterology]] from [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. In 2003 Brinson founded [[Redeem the Vote]], an organization originally modeled after the youth-vote [[Rock the Vote]] campaign to register young people of faith to vote. The organization has since moved to issue advocacy and mobilization of an email list self-reported at 71 million names.

A lifelong Republican, Brinson grew up in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] and went to boarding school in South Carolina, where he worked on the successful gubernatorial campaign of [[James Burrows Edwards]], the first Republican since the [[Reconstruction Era]] to hold that office. He attended [[Valdosta State College]], where he met his wife, Pamela Bennett.  After attending the [[Medical College of Georgia]] he was a resident at the [[University of Florida College of Medicine]]. He completed his gastroenterology fellowship back at the Medical College of Georgia, then moved to Alabama.

From 1987 to 1989 Brinson was staff gastroenterologist at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]] and then went into private practice. In the late 1990s he advised [[governor of Alabama]] [[Fob James]] on health-care issues and helped found the [[Christian music]] radio network [[WAY-FM Network|WAY-FM]]. He serves on the state board of the [[Fellowship of Christian Athletes]], and the Board of Trustees for the [[University of Mobile]].

By October 2004, Redeem the Vote had enlisted 47 [[Contemporary Christian music]] groups,  including [[Steven Curtis Chapman]], [[Point of Grace]], [[Jeremy Camp]], [[FFH (band)|FFH]] and [[Jaci Velasquez]], to register young evangelicals and promote political participation. 
Sponsors included [[Sean Hannity]] and Fox News, the [[American Tract Society]], [[Focus on the Family]], [[FamilyNet]] and the [[Gospel Music Association]]. Gov. [[Mike Huckabee]] of Arkansas, [[Chuck Colson]] of [[Prison Fellowship]] and [[Gary Bauer]] of [[American Values]] were members of the national advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The group estimated it registered between 70,000 and 78,000 members based on the 30,000 forms distributed at concerts and 40,000 over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Meanwhile, its email list grew in connection with the promotions for "Passion of the Christ," reaching 12 million addresses by the election. A video message recorded by Christ portrayer [[Jim Caviezel]] was shown in churches across the country and e-mailed to more than 60 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to preserve the God-given freedoms we each hold dear, it's important that we let our voices be heard. Voting is not only a privilege, but also an important responsibility to let your voice be heard. It's critical that you participate in the political process, and we encourage you to get involved. Together we can make a difference by voting on Nov. 2. See you at the polls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vbuttons.com/ec/1407/index.php?em_id=1317958 Jim Caviezel for Redeem the Vote]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More recently, during the [[United States Republican Party presidential nomination, 2008|2008 Republican nomination campaign]], Brinson's group partnered with the [[Mike Huckabee]] campaign. Huckabee had been an RTV national chairman in 2004, and the Huckabee campaign showed the most interest when a Redeem the Vote list manager, Webcasting TV, pitched their services. RTV claims to now have 71 million addresses, 25 million belonging to "25 and 45 years old, upwardly mobile, right-of-center, conservative households." The campaign got over 414,000 [[Iowa]] contacts from Brinson's list, which is four times the expected participation in the [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2008|Iowa caucuses]].&lt;ref name="Cillizza"&gt;{{cite news

'''Richard Leroy Walters''' (May 3, 1931 – August 19, 2007) was a jet propulsion engineer who died [[homeless]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and left a bequest of $4 million to charities, including [[National Public Radio]] and the Mission of Mercy, in Phoenix.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news

During the [[Korean War]] he served in the [[US marines|Marines]]. According to the 1959 Purdue University yearbook, his hometown was [[Huntington, Indiana]] and he was a member of the honorary engineering societies [[Pi Tau Sigma]], [[Tau Beta Pi]], and the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]].&lt;ref name="Debris"&gt;{{cite book

After 23 years of working at [[Allied Signal|Allied Signal Aerospace]] he was forced into early retirement, and began living on the streets. While living on the streets, he was always neat and clean and wore a baseball cap and small backpack, but was very reserved and lacked social skills.&lt;ref name="MOM"/&gt;  He did not own a car. Rita Belle, a volunteer nurse with the mission, befriended Walters for nine years and helped him find temporary housing after she learned that he slept behind a local senior center.  Nevertheless, he chose to leave the housing after a short time. He used the telephone in the center's billiards room to make his investments, and he completed his own income tax forms.&lt;ref name="Belle"/&gt;

During his last years he suffered from severe [[diabetes]] and [[high blood pressure]].  He had two operations on his legs to improve his circulation, two operations on his eyes, and a [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|quadruple bypass]] heart operation.  After suffering a [[stroke]] he contacted Belle, but at first resisted hospitalization because he felt he hadn't benefited from previous medical treatments.  In the hospital he suffered another stroke and died.&lt;ref name="Belle"/&gt;

He was an avowed [[atheist]] but converted to [[Catholicism]] on his [[Deathbed conversion|deathbed]], with the aid of Belle.&lt;ref name="Belle"&gt;{{cite news

Belle was the executor of the estate, as well as a beneficiary.  Several charities received about $400,000 each from the estate, including [[National Public Radio]] and the Mission of Mercy. NPR announces on air: "Support for NPR comes from the estate of Richard Leroy Walters, whose life was enriched by NPR, and whose bequest seeks to encourage others to discover public radio."&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

A lobbyist and civil engineer by trade, Kito was appointed to serve out the term of [[Beth Kerttula]] in House District 32 after she resigned in early 2014. Governor [[Sean Parnell]] selected him in February from among three nominees forwarded by the Tongass Democrats, passing over [[Assembly of the City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska|Juneau Assembly]]man Jesse Kiehl and [[Juneau School District]] budget committeewoman Catherine Reardon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://juneauempire.com/local/2014-02-04/tongass-democrats-deliver-names-open-house-seat|agency=Juneau Empire|first=Jennifer|last=Canfield|date=February 4, 2014|accessdate=February 8, 2015|title=Tongass Democrats deliver names for open House seat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ktuu.com/news/news/sam-kito-iii-nominated-to-fill-rep-kertullas-house-seat/24605136|agency=KTUU|title=Sam Kito III Nominated to fill Rep.

'''Samuel Paul Kershaw''' (born February 24, 1958) is an American [[country music]] artist. He has released 16 studio albums, with three RIAA platinum certifications and two gold certifications among them. More than 25 singles have entered Top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including the number one hit "[[She Don't Know She's Beautiful]]" and 10 more Top 10 hits: "[[Cadillac Style]]", "[[Anywhere but Here (song)|Anywhere but Here]]", "[[Haunted Heart (song)|Haunted Heart]]", "[[Queen of My Double-Wide Trailer]]", "[[I Can't Reach Her Anymore]]", "[[National Working Woman's Holiday]]", "[[Third Rate Romance]]", "[[Meant to Be (Sammy Kershaw song)|Meant to Be]]", "[[Vidalia (song)|Vidalia]]", and "[[Love of My Life (Sammy Kershaw song)|Love of My Life]]".

Kershaw tried to enter politics, running as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for [[lieutenant governor of Louisiana]] in 2007 and 2010. In 2007 he finished third in the jungle primary, but Democrat [[Mitch Landrieu]] won strongly in the general election. In 2010 he carried more parishes than any other candidate, but placed third. He endorsed Republican [[Jay Dardenne]], Secretary of State, for the position, who won the general election.

==Early life and career==
Sammy Kershaw was born in the [[Acadiana]] town of [[Kaplan, Louisiana|Kaplan]], located in south Louisiana. He is the third cousin of singer [[Doug Kershaw]].&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; When he was 11, his grandfather gave him his first [[guitar]]. But his father died that year, so Sammy started to work a variety of day jobs while playing [[Roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]]s at night to support his family. He began performing in Acadiana with Louisiana legend [[J.B. Pere]]. At the age of 12, Kershaw was playing in a variety of honky-tonks and beer joints, and when he was 14 he met [[George Jones]], his lifelong idol.&lt;ref name="villages-news.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villages-news.com/sammy-kershaw-tells-tales-battling-booze-bankruptcy-lorrie-morgan |title=Sammy Kershaw tells tales of battling booze, bankruptcy and Lorrie Morgan |website=Villages-News.com|accessdate=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he opened shows for [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Merle Haggard]], and [[George Jones]] while still barely into his teens. When the pressures of growing up fast took their toll in the form of a serious [[drug abuse|drug]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] problem, he quit his bad habits in 1988. He took a break from the music world to work as a remodeling supervisor at [[Wal-Mart]].&lt;ref name="liner"/&gt;

==Musical career==
One of Kershaw's demonstration tapes made its way to [[Mercury Records]], which released his debut album ''[[Don't Go Near the Water (album)|Don't Go Near the Water]]'' in 1991. This album was certified [[platinum album|platinum]] by the [[RIAA]], and it produced four hit singles. The lead-off, "[[Cadillac Style]]", went to No.&amp;nbsp;3 in late 1991 and early 1992, followed by the [[Don't Go Near the Water (Sammy Kershaw song)|title track]] at No.&amp;nbsp;12, "[[Yard Sale (song)|Yard Sale]]" at No.&amp;nbsp;17, and "[[Anywhere but Here (song)|Anywhere but Here]]" at No.&amp;nbsp;10. Kershaw was initially reluctant to release "Cadillac Style" because he felt that it was not suitable for his style; however, his co-producer, [[Buddy Cannon]], convinced him to give the song a chance.&lt;ref name="liner"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=The Definitive Collection |titlelink=The Definitive Collection (Sammy Kershaw album) |others=Sammy Kershaw |year=2004 |first=Robin |last=Flans |type=CD |publisher=Mercury Records |id=B0002330-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kershaw's often [[honky-tonk]] material and singing voice led to critical comparisons to [[George Jones]],&lt;ref name="liner"/&gt; and he covered one of Jones's early singles, "What Am I Worth", on his debut as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r123511|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Don't Go Near the Water'' review |accessdate=2008-10-02 |last=Mansfield |first=Brian |work=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kershaw's second album, ''[[Haunted Heart (Sammy Kershaw album)|Haunted Heart]]'', followed in 1993. Its lead-off single, "[[She Don't Know She's Beautiful]]", became his only Number One hit, in April of that year. Following it were the [[Haunted Heart (song)|title track]], the [[Dennis Linde]]–penned "[[Queen of My Double-Wide Trailer]]", and "[[I Can't Reach Her Anymore]]", all of which hit the Top 10 as well. Although Kershaw had been told by others that radio audiences might not identify with the subject matter on "Queen of My Double-Wide Trailer", Kershaw wanted to release the song because he had an experience similar to its story line.&lt;ref name="liner"/&gt; Like his debut, ''Haunted Heart'' was a platinum album.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; In mid-1994, Kershaw also covered the [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] song "[[I Know a Little]]" on the tribute album ''[[Skynyrd Frynds]]'', which included country music covers of Skynyrd songs. Also in 1994, Kershaw contributed the song "[[Fire and Rain (song)|Fire and Rain]]" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

''[[Feelin' Good Train]]'' was Kershaw's third album, released later in 1994. This album also produced four hits, including two consecutive No.&amp;nbsp;2's in "[[National Working Woman's Holiday]]" and "[[Third Rate Romance]]" (the latter a cover of the [[Amazing Rhythm Aces]] hit from 1975),&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; with the No.&amp;nbsp;27 "[[Southbound (song)|Southbound]]" and No.&amp;nbsp;18 "[[If You're Gonna Walk, I'm Gonna Crawl]]" following in 1995. The album included a duet with George Jones on "Never Bit a Bullet Like This", which had previously been released on Jones's 1993 album ''[[High-Tech Redneck]]''. ''Feelin' Good Train'' was certified gold. It was followed by a Christmas album, ''[[Christmas Time's A-Comin' (album)|Christmas Time's A-Comin']]'', and Kershaw's first greatest-hits package, ''Greatest Hits, Volume 1'', both in 1995. The latter produced a No.&amp;nbsp;47 single in "Your Tattoo" (written by [[Kostas Lazarides|Kostas]] and [[Jack Tempchin]]), the first single of Kershaw's career not to reach the Top 40.

===Mid-late 1990s===
Kershaw's fourth studio album, the gold-certified ''[[Politics, Religion and Her]]'', was issued in 1996. It produced Top 10 hits in "[[Meant to Be (Sammy Kershaw song)|Meant to Be]]" and "[[Vidalia (song)|Vidalia]]", the latter of which Kershaw also considered a risky song, saying, "If radio will play this one more than twice—so people can get the story and learn what a [[Vidalia onion]] is—it'll be a smash."&lt;ref name="liner"/&gt; These songs were followed by "[[Fit to Be Tied Down (Sammy Kershaw song)|Fit to Be Tied Down]]" and the [[Politics, Religion and Her (song)|title track]], both of which hit the Top 30. Also included on ''Politics, Religion and Her'' were covers of [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[Memphis, Tennessee (song)|Memphis, Tennessee]]" and [[Sammy Johns]]' "[[Chevy Van (song)|Chevy Van]]". The same year, Kershaw briefly took ownership of a [[NASCAR]] Busch series team (now Xfinity Series).

''[[Labor of Love (Sammy Kershaw album)|Labor of Love]]'' was issued later in 1997 as his fifth album. Unlike his previous albums, this one was predominantly composed of ballads.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; It produced a No.&amp;nbsp;2 in "[[Love of My Life (Sammy Kershaw song)|Love of My Life]]", and although none of the other three singles ("[[Matches (song)|Matches]]", "[[Honky Tonk America]]" and "[[One Day Left to Live]]") reached higher than No.&amp;nbsp;22, the album was nonetheless certified platinum. His next album, ''[[Maybe Not Tonight]]'', brought a Top 20 duet with [[Lorrie Morgan]].&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; 

Kershaw stated that he enjoyed working with Morgan on the song, telling ''[[Country Weekly]]'' magazine, "I knew our vocals would match up… Plus, we have fun together. We're friends and we have been friends for a long time."&lt;ref name="liner"/&gt; "[[Maybe Not Tonight (song)|Maybe Not Tonight]]" was commercially less successful than its predecessors, however, and it became the first album of Kershaw's career not to achieve an RIAA certification. Following "Maybe Not Tonight" were the singles "[[When You Love Someone (Sammy Kershaw song)|When You Love Someone]]" and "[[Me and Maxine]]", both of which peaked in the thirties. "[[Louisiana Hot Sauce]]", the final release from ''[[Maybe Not Tonight]]'', was also the first single of his career not to enter the charts.

In 2000, Kershaw released an album of [[cover song]]s, ''[[Covers the Hits]]''. This album comprised 10 cover songs that Kershaw had recorded in his career. Some of the songs on it, such as the single "Third Rate Romance", were previously found on Kershaw's studio albums, while others came from various tribute albums (such as ''Skynyrd Frynds'') to which he had contributed. ''Covers the Hits'' also included a rendition of [[Dr. Hook]]'s "Little Bit More", a previously unreleased cover which Kershaw had recorded during the sessions for ''Labor of Love''.

===2000s===
By 2001, Kershaw and Morgan had married. The two recorded a vocal duet album in 2001 entitled ''[[I Finally Found Someone (Lorrie Morgan and Sammy Kershaw album)|I Finally Found Someone]]'' (the [[I Finally Found Someone|title track]] being a cover of the [[Bryan Adams]]/[[Barbra Streisand]] duet). This album was less successful commercially, with its only Top 40 hit being the No. 39 "He Drinks Tequila". Shortly afterward, a second 'greatest hits' package was released, and Kershaw left Mercury's roster.

In 2003, Kershaw signed to [[Audium Entertainment]] to release the album ''[[I Want My Money Back]]''.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; This album produced a No. 33-peaking in its [[I Want My Money Back (song)|title track]], but the second single "I've Never Been Anywhere" fell short of the Top 40. The third and final single, "Beer, Bait &amp; Ammo" (which failed to chart), was previously recorded and written by [[Kevin Fowler]] on his 2000 debut album [[Beer, Bait &amp; Ammo|of the same name]], and would later be recorded by [[Mark Chesnutt]] on his 2004 album ''[[Savin' the Honky Tonk]]''.

After Audium closed its Nashville division, Kershaw signed to [[Category 5 Records]], then a newly established independent label, in 2006. His first release for the label and first chart single in three years, "Tennessee Girl", fell three spaces short of the Top 40 that year. It was the first release from his 2006 album ''[[Honky Tonk Boots]]''. The album's only other single, a cover of [[Mel McDaniel]]'s Number One hit "[[Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On]]", failed to chart, and financial difficulties caused the label to close in 2007. In October of the same year, Kershaw divorced Morgan, citing [[irreconcilable differences]].

In 2008, Sammy Kershaw was inducted into The [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]] in honor of his career achievements and was also inducted into the Louisiana Songwriters Association Hall Of Fame in 2010.

Kershaw's first single in two years, "[[Real People (song)|Real People]]", was released in late 2008 in the Boomerville/Big Hit label. However, the single failed to chart. His tenth studio album, ''[[Better Than I Used to Be]]'', was released on August 31, 2010.

===Political activity===
Kershaw had become increasingly interested in politics. On June 13, 2007, he announced his candidacy for [[lieutenant governor]] of Louisiana in the October 20 [[jungle primary]]. The position was held by the incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], [[Mitch Landrieu]]. Kershaw also faced a second Republican candidate, [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Representative]] [[Gary Beard]] of [[Baton Rouge]], an [[engineer]] first elected to the State House in a 2001 [[special election]]. Kershaw finished second with 30 percent of the vote, but Landrieu won re-election with a majority on the first ballot.

Watching his state embroiled in the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|Gulf Oil Spill]] in April 2010, Kershaw, a Lafayette resident, became the official spokesperson for Protect Our Coastline, a non-profit dedicated to providing relief to the fishermen and shrimpers affected most by the spill.

On August 28, 2010, Kershaw announced his second bid for lieutenant governor in the October 2 [[special election]] to replace Mitch Landrieu, who left office in May after being elected [[mayor]] of [[New Orleans]]. Kershaw's intraparty rivals included  state Republican chair [[Roger F. Villere Jr.]] of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]], [[St. Tammany Parish]] president Kevin Davis of [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]], and Secretary of State [[Jay Dardenne]] of Baton Rouge. Kershaw polled 19 percent and carried 31 of the 64 parishes (more than any other candidate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the 2011 race for lieutenant governor, Kershaw endorsed Dardenne's opponent, fellow Republican [[Billy Nungesser]].  Dardenne ultimately defeated Nungesser 53%-47%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theadvertiser.com/article/20111023/NEWS01/110230338/In-brutalest-races-Dardenne-survives ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025230724/http://www.theadvertiser.com/article/20111023/NEWS01/110230338/In-brutalest-races-Dardenne-survives |date=October 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
Kershaw continues touring throughout the year with his band, as well as performances with his often sold-out acoustic "Roots and Boots" tour, featuring himself onstage with other artists including [[Aaron Tippin]], [[Joe Diffie]], [[Pam Tillis]], [[Darryl Worley]], [[Colin Raye]], and others.

On June 27, 2016, Kershaw performed in [[The Villages, Florida]] with a six piece band, including a steel guitar and fiddle. During the performance, Kershaw frequently made mention of not wanting to "look back" and instead continue to make music.&lt;ref name="villages-news.com"/&gt;

===Conception===
''One Life to Live'' series creator Agnes Nixon conceived the central role of Victoria "Viki" Lord inspired by her relationship with her domineering father, Harry Eckhardt, and her own married family life along the [[Philadelphia Main Line]] in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]].&lt;ref name="Legends"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael Callahan |year=2007 |title=Legends: The Original Desperate Housewife |journal=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]] |issue=May 2007 |publisher=[[Metrocorp]] |url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/legends-the-original-desperate-housewife/ |accessdate=August 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shemadeit.org/meet/biography.aspx?m=45 |title=She Made It: Agnes Nixon, Television Writer, Producer |work=[[Paley Center for Media|The Paley Center for Media]] |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon took further inspiration from lead protagonist Tracy Lord of the 1939 play ''[[The Philadelphia Story (play)|The Philadelphia Story]]'',&lt;ref name="Martha"&gt;{{cite book |title=No End to Her: Soap Opera and the Female Subject |last=Nochimson |first=Martha |year=1993 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=[[Berkeley, California]] |isbn=9780520077713 |page=64 |accessdate=July 11, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3b-ufUPQ6qsC&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Showbiz Viki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.showbiz411.com/2012/01/03/one-life-to-live-has-but-9-episodes-left-starting-today |title=''One Life to Live'' Has But 9 Episodes Left Starting Today |author=[[Roger Friedman]] |date=January 3, 2012 |work=[[Showbiz411]] |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; portrayed on stage and [[The Philadelphia Story (film)|film]] by actress [[Katharine Hepburn]].

===Casting===
The role of Victoria was originally cast to Gillian Spencer, who appeared from the July 1968 debut until 1970.&lt;ref name="1985 Encyc"/&gt; [[Joanne Dorian]] replaced Spencer from October 1970 until March 16, 1971,&lt;ref name="1985 Encyc"/&gt; when established theater actress Erika Slezak stepped into the role in the following day's episode.&lt;ref name="1985 Encyc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SOD stats Slezak"/&gt; Slezak became synonymous with the character role since her first appearance in the role March 17, 1971, playing Victoria [[list of longest-serving soap opera actors#United States|continually for 41 years]] until the original ''One Life'' television finale in 2012. Slezak reprised the role onscreen upon [[Prospect Park (production company)|Prospect Park]] resumption of the serial from April 29, 2013 through the final episode released August 19, 2013.&lt;ref name="OLTL suspended"/&gt;

Two other actresses portrayed Victoria while Slezak was on [[parental leave|maternity]] and personal leave: [[Christine Jones (actress)|Christine Jones]] in 1980 and 1981,&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;[http://www.soapcentral.com/oltl/whoswho/victoria.php Victoria Lord Davidson profile – SoapCentral.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Judith Barcroft]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt; In the summer of 2003, Slezak's real-life daughter, [[Amanda Davies (actress)|Amanda Davies]], portrayed a teenaged Victoria in flashbacks.&lt;ref name="SOD stats Slezak"/&gt; Leah Marie Hays played the role of a young Victoria Lord in a series of flashbacks as well.

At the death of show and character creator [[Agnes Nixon]] in 2016, Slezak [[eulogy|eulogized]] that, "When she hired me to play Viki on ''One Life To Live'', she changed my life and my career and I will forever be grateful to her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160929102426/http://www.erikaslezak.com/ |url=http://www.erikaslezak.com |title=Agnes Nixon: A Note from Erika about Agnes Nixon |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |archivedate=September 29, 2016 |date=September 28, 2016 |website=Erika Slezak Fan Club |access-date=September 29, 2016 |quote="I am so terribly saddened by the death of Agnes Nixon.

When she hired me to play Viki on One Life To Live, she changed my life and my career and I will forever be grateful to her. I wish her peace and angels all around her. She deserves that!"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slezak expressed interest for reprising portrayal of the character in a short-term [[guest appearance]] on ABC's last remaining soap opera, ''[[General Hospital]]'', in a March 2018 interview with ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' magazine, ahead of the 50th anniversary of the July 1968 premiere of ''One Life to Live''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Larson |first=Kelli M. |date=March 21, 2018 |title=''ONE LIFE TO LIVE'' Star Erika Slezak Opens up About Her Return to Television (EXCLUSIVE) |url=http://www.abc.soapsindepth.com/posts/one-life-to-live-erika-slezak-the-resident-155754 |magazine=[[Soap Opera Digest]] |access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characterization===
At the debut episode of ''One Life to Live'' July 15, 1968, twentysomething recent college graduate and [[heir]]ess Victoria "Viki" Lord is described by author Martha Nochimson as "blonde [and] ivory-complexioned... the clichéd American princess," personifying the "woman on a pedestal" archetype.&lt;ref name=Martha/&gt; The show's [[hero]]ine from the outset,&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt; [[ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] Victoria initially harbors a strong [[Electra complex]] and suffers a bout with [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] prompted by her mother [[Eugenia Randolph|Eugenia]]'s absence from childhood and father [[Victor Lord|Victor]]'s incessant grooming of her to eventually helm the family's communication business, [[Lord Enterprises]]. As Erika Slezak stepped into the role in 1971, head writer Nixon matured Victoria to a self-assured working woman managing fictional [[Llanview]]'s predominant newspaper, ''The Banner''. An increasingly headstrong Victoria, relinquishing her primal desires to pander to Victor, marries working-class ''Banner'' editor [[Joe Riley (One Life to Live)|Joe Riley]], much to the patriarch's chagrin.&lt;ref name=Martha/&gt;

By the mid-1980s, Victoria largely adopts a matronly role&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1995 |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |volume=145 |issue=18–26 |pages=76 |publisher=[[Time Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with her capacities as well-connected town businesswoman and socialite, though she is still plagued with intermittent bouts of mental illness. The character comes to mother five of her own children onscreen (three from infancy), while providing surrogate nurture to younger siblings [[Tina Lord|Tina]] and [[Todd Manning|Todd]]. Since 2000s, the role has evolved to be regarded as the "[[grande dame]] of Llanview."&lt;ref name=PeopleSpecial/&gt;&lt;ref name=FinaleHeaven/&gt;&lt;ref name=McConnell/&gt; In a 2006 ''[[Boston (magazine)|Boston]]'' magazine article, Slezak remarked of Victoria representing "the very classy, very old-world money,"&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt; with writer Michael Callahan calling the character "the stiff-upper-lipped matriarch"&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt; of the prominent [[Lord family]].

American journalist and soap opera critic [[Connie Passalacqua Hayman]] ([[pen name]] "Marlena De Lacroix") briefly summed up the character role:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... Slezak's 'Viki' is the consummate soap opera heroine, because she has so harrowingly and humanistically triumphed over all her life's tragedies."&lt;ref name="GreatSoapActress"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2010/02/50-greatest-soap-actresses-3-erika.html |title=50 Greatest Soap Actresses: #3 Erika Slezak |author=Staff writer |date=February 7, 2010 |website=[[We Love Soaps]] |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Character development==

===1960s and 1970s===
The eldest child of domineering millionaire publisher [[Victor Lord]] ([[Ernest Graves (actor)|Ernest Graves]]), Victoria Lord, often nicknamed "Viki," (originally Spencer) has little time for romance when ''One Life to Live'' begins in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |series=One Life to Live |serieslink=One Life to Live |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |year=1968 |season=1 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; She clashes with reporter [[Joe Riley (One Life to Live)|Joe Riley]] ([[Lee Patterson]]), but they soon fall in love; Victor disapproves and tries to keep them apart. Torn between pleasing her father and following her heart, Viki develops a wild [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]] named "Niki Smith", who falls in love with [[Vince Wolek|Vinny Wolek]] ([[Antony Ponzini]]). Viki's illness — apparently caused by seeing her pregnant mother fall down the stairs as a child — is eventually treated, and she and Joe marry December 11, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |series=One Life to Live |serieslink=One Life to Live |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date=December 11, 1969 |season=2 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/1968-69/1968.html |title=''One Life to Live'' recap (1968–69) |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |accessdate=November 21, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423033131/http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/1968-69/1968.html |archivedate=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe is presumed dead in a car accident in 1970, and a heartbroken Viki (Slezak onward)&lt;!--Viki/Steve romance begins when Slezak assumes the role--&gt; finds comfort with fellow reporter [[Steve Burke (One Life to Live)|Steve Burke]] (Bernie Grant) in 1971.

Ben's first wife, [[Skye Chandler]] ([[Robin Christopher]]), comes to town and tries in vain to keep Ben and Viki apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |series=One Life to Live |serieslink=One Life to Live |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date=1999–2000 |season=31 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

Viki is diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] in 2000, but survives after a mastectomy and chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |series=One Life to Live |serieslink=One Life to Live |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date=February–August 2000 |season=31–32 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and Ben marry in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/2000-01/1100.html |title=''One Life to Live'' recap (November 2000) |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |accessdate=June 26, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402062227/http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/2000-01/1100.html |archivedate=April 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, a girl named [[Natalie Buchanan|Natalie Balsom]] ([[Melissa Archer]]) makes the startling claim that she is Viki and Clint's biological daughter, which is confirmed by a [[genetic fingerprinting|DNA test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |series=One Life to Live |serieslink=One Life to Live |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date=October 2001 |season=33 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitch Laurence returns from the dead, divulging to Viki he drugged and raped her around the same time she and Clint conceived Jessica and had unknowingly become pregnant with fraternal twins, one fathered by Clint, Natalie, and the other fathered by Mitch, Jessica ([[Erin Torpey]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |series=One Life to Live |serieslink=One Life to Live |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date=November–December 2002 |season=34 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to reconcile the revelation, Niki Smith emerges during the ordeal and plots to kill Ben in order to have her freedom, but when Ben is accidentally shot by [[Antonio Vega (character)|Antonio Vega]] ([[Kamar de los Reyes]]), Viki returns. Ben is left comatose after the shooting. In 2003, Victor (William Stone Mahoney) is ostensibly revealed to be alive, claiming to have faked his death in 1976; however, shortly after he returns, Victor dies — but not before Viki and Todd confront him on ills inflicted to them in his wake.&lt;ref name = "seedofdoubt"/&gt; In 2004, Viki is diagnosed with heart disease and eventually needs a heart transplant. Coincidentally, a comatose Ben dies just as Viki takes a turn for the worse, and his heart is transplanted into Viki, who recovers but must face widowhood once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=All My Stories |author=Renee Michael |url=http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/all-my-stories/ |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 19, 2011 |accessdate=June 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Viki and Clint ([[Jerry verDorn]]) start dating again, but Dorian decides she wants Clint for herself and plots to break up the couple. Dorian's schemes succeed, and Clint ends things with Viki to start a new relationship with Dorian. Feeling humiliated and defeated, Viki leaves Llanview for a much-needed vacation and finds herself in [[Paris, Texas]], where she tries to reinvent herself by waiting tables at a local diner. It is there that she meets patron [[Charlie Banks (One Life to Live)|Charlie Banks]] ([[Brian Kerwin]]), a recovering alcoholic, and the two begin seeing one another. Viki ultimately returns to Llanview once her family discovers her secret life, and Charlie's search for his estranged son [[Jared Banks|Jared]] ([[John Brotherton]]) leads him there as well. Viki and Charlie resume their relationship, but break up when Viki discovers that Charlie had lied about the identity of his son in extenuating circumstances. In July 2008, Viki is involved in a car accident with Dorian; Viki's heart stops as a result of the crash, but Dorian manages to revive her. Reexamining her life, Viki reunites with Charlie, and they marry on August 4, 2009. Viki runs for mayor against Dorian and wins; she steps down, however, to help her family deal with the unexpected return of Mitch Laurence, who wreaks havoc on her daughters and murders Jared in the process.

===2010–12===
Charlie, devastated over his son's death, quits his sobriety and began drinking, distancing himself from Viki, choosing instead to conspire with Dorian to kill Mitch. Though Dorian tries to stop him at the last minute, Charlie ends up accidentally shooting Jessica ([[Bree Williamson]] onward), who survives. Devastated by Charlie's actions, Viki asks him for a divorce, but they eventually reconcile. Viki and Charlie's marriage is further complicated by the return of Echo DiSavoy, a woman who almost destroyed her marriage to Clint in 1983. Echo begins insinuating herself into Charlie and Viki's marriage, much to Viki's dismay. When a paternity revealed Charlie not to be the father of [[Rex Balsom]] ([[John-Paul Lavoisier]]), a devastated Charlie turns to Echo for comfort. Dorian, who had suspicions about Echo and Charlie's dealings, forged a truce with Viki to uncover Charlie's misgivings. A devastated Viki finds out about Charlie's affair and definitively asks him for a divorce. After confronting Charlie and Echo, Viki goes to court to fight for custody of grandson [[Ryder Ford]] while his mother Jessica was ill with her multiple personality. A stressed Viki suffers a bout with multiple personalities on the stand, leading the judge against giving the child to Viki but instead to her son and daughter-in-law, Joey (Tom Degnan) and [[Aubrey Wentworth|Aubrey Buchanan]] ([[Terri Conn]]).

In summer 2011 a man with the "original" face of her only known living brother, Todd (Howarth), returned to Llanview claiming to be the victim of eight years of imprisonment and torture at the hands of his mother and Viki's childhood friend, a back-from-the-dead Irene Manning ([[Barbara Rhoades]]). After medical tests revealed the "newer" Todd ([[Trevor St. John]]) and the "old" Todd (Howarth) to have identical DNA, Irene appeared to reveal the "two Todds" to be twins. The man who resembled Walker Laurence (St. John) and who has been living as Todd since 2003 was revealed actually have been born [[Victor Lord, Jr.]], brainwashed into believing that he is Todd by Irene. Meanwhile, Viki agrees in court to put up Clint in Llanfair for [[house arrest]] after he was convicted of various crimes in Llanview. Dorian and Viki ostensibly put an end to their feud of nearly four decades when Dorian leaves town to become an acting [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]]. Viki continues work at ''The Banner'' when Tina returns to town for the reading of the will of recently murdered Victor, Jr. After months of rehashing old feelings and living under the same roof, Clint and Viki too admit to their unresolved feelings and agreed to give a romantic relationship one more try.

At the original finale, a prison breakout leads Allison Perkins to shoot both Clint and Viki, but only after telling the two that Jessica was in fact Clint's daughter and not the daughter of Mitch Laurence. Clint sanctioned another paternity test and, in the presence of Jessica, Viki, and Natalie, revealed Allison's claim to be true.  Following all the emotional revelations and tears, Clint again declares his undying love for Viki and asks her to marry him for a third time.

===2013===
&lt;!-- PLEASE: NO DAILY RECAPS, JUST MAJOR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENTS --&gt;
Upon the series resumption in April 2013, Viki accepts Clint's marriage proposal, and concurrently hires freelance journalist [[Jeffrey King]] ([[Corbin Bleu]]) to investigate the alleged congressional malfeasance of junior U.S. senator Dorian. Upon visiting niece [[Danielle Manning]] (Kelley Missal) in the hospital after overdosing on drugs and alcohol, she uncovers her brother Victor, Jr. to be alive. With her family newspaper in financial straits, ''The Banner'' focuses on growing the publication's online presence.

===Alternate personalities===

As of the final ABC episode, all of Victoria's six&lt;ref name="Anniversary"&gt;{{cite book |title=The ''One Life to Live'' 40th Anniversary Trivia Book |last=Waggett |first=Gerry |year=2008 |publisher=[[Hyperion Books]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=9781401323097 |accessdate=August 19, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FxIAmjBPZCQC&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;ots=jPIY92jufN}}&lt;/ref&gt; alternate personalities are integrated with her baseline psyche. At times during the series, Viki has been forced to impersonate one of them, particularly Niki and Jean. In order of their first appearance on ''One Life to Live'', they are:
* '''Nicole "Niki" Smith''' – a devil-may-care, sexually promiscuous party girl, approximately 22 years old. First appearing on the episode first-run November 15, 1968, Niki appears more times than all of the other alters combined, and is very skilled at masquerading as Viki when necessary to hide her re-emergence.&lt;ref name=OLTL111568&gt;{{Cite episode |title= |series= One Life to Live |series-link= One Life to Live |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date=November 15, 1968 |season= 1 |credits = Doris Quinlan ([[Executive producer]]); [[Agnes Nixon]], Paul Roberts and Don Wallace ([[Head writer]]s)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niki has had two serious relationships with [[Vince Wolek]] (1968–69) and [[Harry O'Neill (One Life to Live)|Harry O'Neill]] (1985); neither Vinny or Harry realized at the time that Niki was an alter of Viki.
* '''Tommy''' – a 14-year-old male alter emerged in 1995, who embodied Viki's anger and rage at her abuse.&lt;ref name=OLTL020295&gt;{{Cite episode |title= |series= One Life to Live |series-link= One Life to Live |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date=February 2, 1995 |season= 27 |credits = Susan Bedsow Horgan ([[Executive producer]]); [[Michael Malone]] and [[Josh Griffith]] ([[Head writer]]s)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tommy usually emerged to protect Princess (another alternate personality), and once threw [[Dorian Lord]] down the La Boulaie staircase and attempted to beat her to death with a [[claw hammer]] in the Llanfair secret room.
* '''Jean Randolph''' – Jean Randolph is the calm, cool, collected and calculating caretaker of all the other alters, who took over when Viki's abusive childhood was revealed.&lt;ref name=OLTL020295 /&gt; Her name is derived from that of Viki's mother, Eugenia Randolph Lord. Jean blackmailed con man [[David Vickers]] into divorcing Viki's sister, [[Tina Lord|Tina]], and also freed Viki's son, [[Joey Buchanan|Joey]], from Dorian Lord's clutches by imprisoning Dorian in a secret room in the basement of Llanfair, which led Joey to believe that Dorian left him. Jean then forced Dorian to marry David to keep them both occupied and away from Viki's loved ones.
* '''Princess''' – a manifestation of Viki as a seven-year-old girl. She is a traumatized child who is constantly reliving the molestation by Viki's father.  Protected by Tommy, the 14-year-old alternate personality, who is most angry about the abuse.
* '''Tori Lord''' – Tori emerged in 1995, approximately 19 years old, after Dorian revealed the truth of Victor's abuse to Viki. It was established that Tori was the alter who murdered Victor Lord in 1976. (It would later be revealed that Victor survived and did not die until 2003. However Dorian has planted [[Lord family#A seed of doubt|a seed of doubt]] regarding that notion, suggesting that the man who re-emerged as Victor in 2003 was a fraud.) Although her declared mission was to force Viki to face the truth, she wreaked much destruction before getting around to that. Tori started undermining ''The Banner'' by feeding stories and information to rival newspaper editor [[Todd Manning]], and she torched Llanfair, nearly killing Jessica in the blaze.
* '''Victor Lord''' – this personality is the reflective image of Viki's abusive father, Victor. The Victor Lord personality only emerged two or three times, but one of the instances that he took over led Viki to attempt suicide by cutting her own wrists to "expel" Victor from her body.

==Reception==
Series [[fansite]] ''Llanview Labyrinth'' remarks that although Gillian Spencer's Victoria is featured at the show's outset, "the obviousness of Viki being the show[']s unquestioned 'lead' did not smack the viewer quite as hard as it later would [with Erika Slezak's portrayal],"&lt;ref name="LLViki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://llanviewlabyrinth.webs.com/recastcontrasts/recasts_viki.html |title=Victoria "Viki" Lord |author=Staff writer |year=2012 |website=Llanview Labyrinth |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Spencer's Victoria melding into the [[ensemble cast]]. Joanne Dorian briefly stepped into the role beginning in October 1970, with a markedly less dynamic presence on the series than her predecessor.

In March 1971, ''One Life to Live'' executive producer Doris Quinlan remarked to ''After Noon TV'' magazine of Erika Slezak and her audition before herself, series creator and head writer Agnes Nixon, and director David Pressman, "You've got to meet this girl—she's going to be a star."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1971 |title=Three Wishes for Erika |journal=After Noon TV |url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Academy/6053/ar71_.html |accessdate=August 19, 2012 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026231445/http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Academy/6053/ar71_.html | archivedate=October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the introduction of Slezak as Victoria, her portrayal has become regarded as definitive to the role.&lt;ref name=LLViki/&gt; Slezak's work has garnered her the acclaim of media critics and viewers alike, earning the actress comparisons between herself and contemporary film star [[Meryl Streep]] for perceived similarities in acting range, versatility, and numerous award nominations.&lt;ref name="Showbiz Viki"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="All My Children": Goodbye to a fondly remembered world |author=Hal Bodoedeker |url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_tv_tvblog/tag/erika-slezak |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=April 17, 2011 |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soapcentral.com/oltl/news/2008/1103-slezak_iview_01.php |title=One-on-One with One Life to Live's Erika Slezak |author=Dan J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1903">'''Woldemichael Solomon''' was an [[Eritrea]]n ruler. He served as the [[Ras (title)|Ras]] (Prince) of the [[Medri Bahri]] kingdom and [[Hamasien]] during the 19th century.
[[File:Ras_Woldemichael_Solomon,_Ruler_of_MedriBahri.jpg|thumb|right|''Ras'' of [[Medri Bahri]].]]

==Life==
Ras Woldemichael was born into the Hazega clan.&lt;ref name="Caulk"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caulk |first1=Richard |title=Bad Men of the Borders: Shum and Shefta in Northern Ethiopia in the 19th Century |journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies |date=1984 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=201–227 |doi=10.2307/218604 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/218604 |accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as prince of [[Hazega]] in [[Eritrea]]. His unofficial title was Ras, Woldemichael Solomon because, although he ruled as a king, his leadership ended before he was crowned the Governor of Hamasien (which is mainly located in present-day Eritrea, where he is widely celebrated as a hero standing for Eritrean sovereignty).&lt;ref name="DenisonPaice2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Denison|author2=Edward Paice|title=Eritrea: The Bradt Travel Guide|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=Qi-KQchGks8C}}|year=2007|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-171-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ras Woldemichael Solomon fought against Emperor [[Yohannes IV]] who sent Ras [[Alula Engida|Alula]] to fight him. When Ras Alula became aware of the difficulties fighting Woldemichael, he tricked him  by arranging a peace treaty that he had no intention of observing, swearing on [[Bible|The Bible]] that he wouldn't attack. However, Alula broke his promise and imprisoned Ras Woldemichael at Amba Selama, ruling Hamasien himself afterwards. Woldemichael later settled in [[Axum]], [[Ethiopia]] until his death in 1906.
