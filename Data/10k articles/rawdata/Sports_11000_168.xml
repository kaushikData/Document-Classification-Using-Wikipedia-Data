The '''2010 [[Gent–Wevelgem]]''' [[road bicycle racing|cycle road race]] took place on March 28, 2010. It was the 72nd edition of the international top classic [[Gent–Wevelgem]]. The final of Gent–Wevelgem was largely redrawn. An extra track was added in [[France]], with a double passage over Mont des Cats and Mont Noir.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gent-wevelgem.be/en/edition-2010/&lt;/ref&gt; The race was the sixth event in the [[2010 UCI World Ranking|UCI World Ranking]].

[[Bernhard Eisel]] (AUT) beat [[Sep Vanmarcke]] of Belgium in a six-way sprint to the finish to win the Ghent-Wevelgem cycling classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/448366/eisel-let-off-the-leash-to-win-ghent-wevelgem.html|title=Eisel let off the leash to win Ghent-Wevelgem |date=2010-02-28|work=Cycling Weekly|accessdate=2010-03-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100401115132/http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/448366/eisel-let-off-the-leash-to-win-ghent-wevelgem.html| archivedate= 1 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the pre-race favourites [[Philippe Gilbert]] finished third ahead of American veteran [[George Hincapie]]. The other pre-race favourites [[Tom Boonen]] and [[Fabian Cancellara]] both dropped out in the middle of the race. Eisel commented after the race, "Until now I never liked this race. The wind and all is not my thing. But from this day on Gent–Wevelgem is going to become my great love."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bicycling.com/article/0,6610,s1-3-10-22181-1,00.html bicycling.com - Race recap]&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of a total of 24 mini-games having their own theme – [[Jungle]], [[Western (genre)|Western]], [[Underwater]], [[Snow]]y and more. In each of the modes, players choose a character or make a new one if there are free character slots. Players also have the ability to use their [[Mii]] characters as well.&lt;ref name="Manual"/&gt;

In ''Treasure Adventure'', players must find as much treasure as possible while working on the top score for each quest. The game also includes a party mode, which can played with up to 8 people. Party mode games can either be played in 5, 10 or 20 rounds. The player with most points after the final round is the winner. The top 5 scores for each game are shown in the Rankings menu.&lt;ref name="Manual"/&gt; In ''Free Play'' mode, players can play any of the 24 mini-games. In ''Party Mode'' as many as eight players compete against each other in a randomly selected mini-game. In ''Treasure Trials'' a player goes through a series of tests to earn a rank. They are Rookie, Amateur, Specialist, Professional, Veteran, Master, and Legend, from lowest to highest.

After a player beats all the Treasure Trials, the ''Challenge Missions'' are unlocked. Here, each mini-game offers two challenges where a skill is practiced.

'''Bowling''' is a [[sport]] or leisure activity in which a player rolls or throws a [[bowling ball]] towards a target. It is one of the major forms of [[throwing sports]]. In pin bowling variations, the target is usually to knock over [[Bowling pin|pins]] at the end of a lane. A strike is when all the pins are knocked down on the first roll, whereas a spare is when all the pins are knocked over on the second shot. The maximum score is 300, which is achieved by getting 12 strikes in a row. Three consecutive strikes are known as a "turkey". Further strings of strikes are referred to as the number with the word "bagger", such as "four-bagger" for four consecutive strikes. The term "hambone" has also been used to describe four consecutive strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bowling.about.com/od/learntobowl/tp/strings_of_strikes.htm|title=12 Nicknames For Consecutive Bowling Strikes|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In target variations, the aim is usually to get the ball as close to a [[Glossary of bowls terms#Mark|mark]] as possible. The pin version of bowling is often played on a flat wooden, or other synthetic, surface (which can be oiled in different patterns for different techniques).&lt;ref&gt;[http://usbcongress.http.internapcdn.net/usbcongress/bowl/rules/pdfs/2009-2010PlayingRules.pdf United States Bowling Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; In target bowling, the surface may be grass, gravel or a synthetic surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crystal-Mark |title=Laws of the Sport of Bowls| year=2010 |publisher=World Bowls Ltd |ref=harv |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common [[Bowling#Types of pins|types]] of pin bowling include [[ten-pin bowling|ten-pin]], [[nine-pin bowling|nine-pin]], [[candlepin]], [[duckpin bowling|duckpin]] and [[five-pin bowling]]. In target bowling, [[bowls]], [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]], [[Kegel (bowling)|kegel]], [[bocce]], [[Carpet Bowls|carpet bowls]], [[pétanque]], and [[boules]], both indoor and outdoor varieties are popular. Today the sport of bowling is played by 100 million people in more than 90 countries worldwide (including 70 million players in the United States),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfmba.com/tidbits.htm|title=Niagara Falls Bowling Association|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102134931/http://nfmba.com/tidbits.htm|archive-date=2 January 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to grow through entertainment media such as video games for home consoles and handheld devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vir2l.com/gamepages/gamepage-amfpinbusters-ngage.php/|title=Bethsoft.com|work=Bethsoft.com|accessdate=24 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329201045/http://www.vir2l.com/gamepages/gamepage-amfpinbusters-ngage.php|archivedate=29 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bowling'' in the United States and Canada usually refers to ten-pin bowling. In the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries it tends to refer to lawn bowls.

==History==
===Antiquity===    
The earliest known forms of bowling date back to [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name="bowlingmuseum1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://helpwithbowling.com/history-origins-of-bowling.php|title=Bowling History - Origin of Bowling|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remnants of balls used at the time were found among artifacts in ancient Egypt going back to the [[Naqada III|Egyptian protodynastic period]] in 3200 BC.&lt;ref name=Pretsell&gt;{{cite book |last=Pretsell|first=James M. |title=The Game of Bowls Past and Present| year=1908 |publisher=Oliver &amp; Boyd |ref=harv |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Balls were made using the husks of grains, covered in a material such as leather, and bound with string.  Other balls made of porcelain have also been found, indicating that these were rolled along the ground rather than thrown due to their size and weight.&lt;ref name=Pretsell/&gt; Some of these resemble the modern day jack used in target bowl games. Bowling games of different forms are also noted by [[Herodotus]] as an invention of the [[Lydians]] in [[Asia Minor]].{{sfn|Pretsell|1908|p=2}}

About 2,000 years ago, in the [[Roman Empire]], a similar game evolved between Roman legionaries entailing the tossing of stone objects as close as possible to other stone objects, which eventually evolved into Italian [[Bocce]], or outdoor bowling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canbowl.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=331:a-little-bowling-history&amp;catid=18:general&amp;Itemid=62|title=A little Bowling History|author=Administrator|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 400 AD, bowling began in Germany as a religious ritual to cleanse oneself from sin by rolling a rock into a club (kegel) representing the heathen, resulting in bowlers being called keglers.&lt;ref name="www.britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/sports/bowling|title=bowling - game|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
In 1299 the oldest known bowling green for target style bowling to survive to modern times was built. Master's Close (now the Old Bowling Green of the Southampton Bowling Club) in [[Southampton, England]] is still in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Linney | first=E.J. |title=A History of the Game of Bowls| year=1933 |publisher=Edingburgh Press |ref=harv |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1325 laws were passed in [[Berlin]] and [[Cologne]] limiting bets on lawn bowling to five shillings.&lt;ref name="www.britannica.com"/&gt;

In 1366 the first official mention of bowling in [[England]] was made, when King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] banned it as a distraction to archery practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bowlingmuseum.com/Visit/History-of-Bowling|title=Bowling Museum &amp; Hall of Fame &gt; Visit &gt; History of Bowling|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th-17th centuries lawn bowling spread from Germany into Austria, Switzerland, and the Low Countries, with playing surfaces
made of cinders or baked clay.&lt;ref name="www.britannica.com"/&gt;

In 1455 lawn bowling lanes in [[London]] were first roofed-over, turning bowling into an all-weather game.&lt;ref name="www.britannica.com"/&gt;  In Germany, they were called kegelbahns, often attached to taverns and guest houses.

In 1463 a public feast was held in [[Frankfurt, Germany]], with a venison dinner followed by lawn bowling.&lt;ref name="www.britannica.com"/&gt;

===16th to 18th centuries===
[[File:Style of David Teniers the Younger Peasants bowling.jpg|thumb|325px|left|Peasants bowling in front of a tavern in the 17th century]]

In 1511 English King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was an avid bowler. He banned bowling for the lower classes and imposed a levy for private lanes to limit them to the wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banwellbowlsclub.com/history.html|title=History of Bowls|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another [[Bowls|English law]], passed in 1541 (repealed in 1845), prohibited workers from bowling, except at [[Christmas]], and only in their master's home and in his presence. In 1530 he acquired [[Whitehall Palace]] in central London as his new residence, having it extensively rebuilt complete with outdoor bowling lanes, indoor tennis court, jousting tiltyard, and cockfighting pit.

Protestant Reformation founder [[Martin Luther]] set the number of pins (which varied from 3 to 17) at nine.{{cn|date=August 2018}} He had a bowling lane built next to his home for his children, sometimes rolling a ball himself.&lt;ref name="www.britannica.com"/&gt;

On 19 July 1588 English Vice-Admiral Sir [[Francis Drake]] allegedly was playing bowls at [[Plymouth Hoe]] when the arrival of the [[Spanish Armada]] was announced, replying "We have time enough to finish the game and beat the Spaniards too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/armada.html|title=The Spanish Armada|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JanSteen05.JPG|thumb|right|325px|The Bowling Game, by Dutch painter [[Jan Steen]], c. 1655. Many [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]s depicted bowling.]]

In 1609 [[Dutch East India Company]] explorer [[Henry Hudson]] discovered [[Hudson Bay]], bringing Dutch colonization to [[New Amsterdam]] (later New York); Hudson's men brought some form of lawn bowling with them.&lt;ref name="www.britannica.com"/&gt;

In 1617 English King [[James I of England|James I]] published ''[[Declaration of Sports]]'', banning bowling on Sundays but permitting dancing and archery for those first attending an Anglican service, outraging Puritans; it was reissued in 1633 by his successor [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], then ordered publicly burned in 1643 by the Puritan Parliament.

In 1670 Dutchmen liked to bowl at the Old King’s Arms Tavern near modern-day 2nd and Broadway in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bowlingmuseum.com/Visit/Online-Exhibits|title=Bowling Museum &amp; Hall of Fame &gt; Visit &gt; Online Exhibits|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1733 [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] in New York City was built on the site of a Dutch cattle market and parade ground, becoming the city's oldest public park to survive to modern times.

===In the 19th century===
A painting from around 1810 shows British bowlers playing a bowling sport outdoors. It shows a triangular formation of ten pins chronologically before it appeared in the United States.&lt;ref name="Pluckhahn121"&gt;Pluckhahn, Bruce; "Bowling Games People Play". ''Bowler's Journal'' magazine, December 1988 issue, pg. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1819, New York writer [[Washington Irving]] made the first mention of ninepin bowling in American literature in his story ''[[Rip Van Winkle]].

On 1 January 1840, Knickerbocker Alleys in New York City opened, becoming the first indoor [[bowling alley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almanac.com/fact/first-recorded-ten-pin-bowling-match-played-at|title=First recorded ten-pin bowling match played…|work=Old Farmer's Almanac|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841, the state of [[Connecticut]] banned nine-pin bowling to stop gambling, causing ten-pin bowling to be created to get around the law&lt;ref name="bowlingmuseum1"/&gt; — some 31 years after the aforementioned British outdoor ten-pin bowling painting was dated.

In 1846, the oldest surviving bowling lanes in the [[United States]] were built as part of [[Roseland Cottage]], the summer estate of Henry Chandler Bowen (1831-1896) in [[Woodstock, Connecticut]]. The lanes, now part of Historic New England's Roseland Cottage House Museum contain Gothic Revival architectural elements in keeping with the style of the entire estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicnewengland.org/historic-properties/homes/roseland-cottage |title=Roseland Cottage&amp;nbsp;— Historic New England |publisher=Historicnewengland.org |date= |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, the [[Revolutions of 1848]] resulted in accelerated German immigration to the U.S., reaching 5 million by 1900, bringing their love of beer and bowling with them; by the late 19th century they made New York City a center of bowling.

In 1848, the [[Bowls|Scottish Bowling Association]] for lawn bowling was founded in Scotland by 200 clubs; it was dissolved then refounded in 1892.

In 1864, [[Glasgow]] cotton merchant William Wallace Mitchell (1803–84) published ''Manual of Bowls Playing'', which became a standard reference for lawn bowling in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pelhamsbowlsclub.co.uk/Pages/History.aspx|title=History|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, the National Bowling Association (NBA) was founded by 27 local clubs in New York City to standardize rules for ten-pin bowling, setting the ball size and the distance between the foul line and the pins, but failing to agree on other rules; it was superseded in 1895 by the American Bowling Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DnCsBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=national+bowling+association+1875|title=Sports in America from Colonial Times to the Twenty-First Century|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, Justin White of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] invented [[Candlepin Bowling]].

In the 1880s, [[Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards|Brunswick Corporation]] (founded 1845) of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], maker of billiard tables began making bowling balls, pins, and wooden lanes to sell to taverns installing bowling alleys.

On 9 September 1895, the modern standardized rules for ten-pin bowling were established in [[New York City]] by the new [[United States Bowling Congress|American Bowling Congress (ABC)]] (later the United States Bowling Congress), who changed the scoring system from a maximum 200 points for 20 balls to a maximum 300 points for 10 balls, and set the maximum ball weight at 16 lbs., and pin distance at 12 inches.  The first ABC champion (1906-1921) was Jimmy Smith (1885-1948).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bowlinghistory.wordpress.com/2009/01/19/jimmy-smith-famous-bowler-bibliography/|title=A Jimmy Smith Bibliography|work=Dr. Jake's Bowling History Blog|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1927 Mrs. Floretta "Doty" McCutcheon (1888-1967) defeated Smith in an exhibition match, founding a school that taught 500,000 women how to bowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bowl.com/Hall_of_Fame/Hall_of_Famers/Superior_Performance/Floretta_McCutcheon/|title=BOWL.com - Floretta McCutcheon|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ballreviews.com/miscellaneous/floretta-mccutcheon-biography-t71008.0.html|title=Floretta McCutcheon biography|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DnCsBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187|title=Sports in America from Colonial Times to the Twenty-First Century|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993 women were allowed to join the ABC.  In 2005 the ABC merged with the Women's International Bowling Congress (WIBC) et al. to become the United States Bowling Congress (USBC).[[File:Bowling trophy 300 game winner 20181106 064933 01.jpg|thumb|left|300 game gold ring]]

The ABC initially used bowling balls made of [[Lignum vitae]] hardwood from the [[Caribbean]], which were eventually supplanted by the [[Ebonite International|Ebonite]] rubber bowling ball (1905) and the [[Brunswick Corporation|Brunswick]] Mineralite rubber ball (1914). In 1980 urethane-shell bowling balls were introduced by Ebonite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bowlingball.com/BowlVersity/bowling-ball-evolution%22|title=#1 Online Bowling Pro Shop, New Bowling Balls, Bowling Bags, Bowling Shoes, Bowling Accessories &amp; Supplies|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 it changed its name to World Bowling.

In 1952 [[American Machine and Foundry]] (AMF) of [[Brooklyn, N.Y.]] began marketing automatic [[Pinsetter]] machines, eliminating the need for pinboys and causing bowling to rocket in popularity, making the 1950s the Decade of the Bowler.

In 1954 Steve Nagy (1913-1966) became the first person to bowl a perfect 300 game on TV on NBC-TV's "Championship Bowling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/22550|title=Steve Nagy (1913 - 1966) - Find A Grave Memorial|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bowl-a-roll.blogspot.com/2011/11/perfect-tv-drama-steve-nagy-is.html|title=Bowl A Roll Lanes: Steve Nagy's 300 Game on Championship Bowling|author=Bowl-A-Roll Lanes|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM_WhRp3E_E|title=Championship Bowling - Steve Nagy 300 (1954)|date=29 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PBA later named its sportsmanship award after him.

==Variations==
Bowling games can be distinguished into two general classes:

===Pin bowling===
[[File:Bowling-japan-jan2013.ogv|right|thumb|275px|Video: A man bowling in [[Japan]]]]
[[File:A_woman_bowling_during_45th_Victory_Day_celebration_Bowling_Tournament%2715_in_Dhaka,_Bangladesh.JPG|right|thumb|275px|A woman bowling during 45th Victory Day celebration Bowling Tournament '15 in Dhaka, [[Bangladesh]].]]

Five main variations are found in [[North America]], varying especially in [[New England]] and parts of [[Canada]]:
* [[Ten-pin bowling]]: largest and heaviest pins, and bowled with a large ball with three finger holes, and the most popular type in North America
* [[Nine-pin bowling]]: pins usually attached to strings at the tops, uses a ball without finger holes.
* [[Candlepin bowling]]: tallest pins (40 cm), thin with matching ends, bowled with the smallest and lightest (at {{convert|1.1|kg|lb}}) handheld ball of any bowling sport, and the only form with ''no'' fallen pins removed during a frame.
* [[Duckpin bowling]]: short, squat, and bowled with a handheld ball.
* [[Five-pin bowling]]: tall, between duckpins and candlepins in diameter with a rubber girdle, bowled with a handheld ball, mostly found in Canada.

===Target bowling===
[[File:BerriganBowls.jpg|right|thumb|275px|A bowls tournament in [[Berrigan, New South Wales]], [[Australia]]]]

Another form of bowling is usually played outdoors on a lawn. At outdoor bowling, the players throw a ball, which is sometimes eccentrically weighted, in an attempt to put it closest to a designated point or slot in the bowling arena.

==Accessibility==
Technological innovation has made bowling accessible to members of the disabled community.
* The IKAN Bowler, a device designed by a [[quadriplegic]] engineer named Bill Miller, attaches to a wheelchair and allows the user to control the speed, direction, and timing of the ten-pin bowling ball's release. The name comes from the Greek work "ikano", which means "enable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abilitymagazine.com/IKAN.html|title=''Ability Magazine: IKAN Bowler’’|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For [[Bowls]] the sport has introduced a number of innovations to enable people with a disability to participate at all levels of the sport, from social through to Olympic Standards:
** The use of [[Glossary of bowls terms#Bowling arm|bowling arms]] and [[Glossary of bowls terms#Lifter|lifters]] enables bowlers to deliver a bowl minimising the amount of movement required
** Wheelchair and green manufacturers  have produced modified wheel tyres and ramps to enable wheelchair athletes to access bowls greens.
** Modified conditions of play as outlined in [[Disability classification in lawn bowls]]

==In popular culture==
===With notable individuals===

'''''Breezing Home''''' is a 1937 American [[drama film]] directed by [[Milton Carruth]] and starring [[Binnie Barnes]], [[William Gargan]] and [[Wendy Barrie]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A racehorse trainer, Steve Rowan, is forced to sell one of his favorites, Galaxy, to a crooked bookie, Joe Montgomery. With the gambler unable to get directly involved, Gloria Lee, who is Joe's girlfriend, acts as the horse's official new owner when Galaxy is entered in a race.

Steve is still the trainer, but quits after Joe fixes the race by bribing a jockey to disrupt Galaxy's race. Steve leaves for California, where wealthy stable owner Henrietta Fairfax hires him to train Memento, her own top thoroughbred. 

Gloria's guilt results in her following Steve out west. She needs to borrow $1,000 to race Galaxy, but is banished from the track when officials discover that Joe gave her the money. Henrietta is in love with Steve but realizes he has feeling for Gloria, permitting him to train Galaxy on her behalf in an upcoming stakes race, which Galaxy wins.

'''Danie Craven Stadium''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Stellenbosch]], [[South Africa]], on a portion of the old [[Coetsenburg|Coetsenburg Estate]] which was founded by [[Dirk Coetsee]] in 1682 after a grant of land from the [[Dutch Cape Colony|Dutch Governor of the Cape Colony]] [[Simon van der Stel]]. It is part of the [[Stellenbosch University]]'s sport facilities. The stadium was named after rugby doyen and [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springbok]] [[Scrum-half (rugby union)|scrum half]] [[Danie Craven]].  The stadium holds 16,000 people and was built in 1979.

The Danie Craven Stadium is currently used mostly for [[rugby football|rugby]] matches. In the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] it hosted the game between [[Australia]] and [[Romania]], and was the first game in South Africa where the national side was not involved.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The stadium also played host to the 2007 [[Touch football (rugby league)|Touch Football]] World Cup where it saw Australia claim the title of World Champions for another 4 years.

Throughout the history of the [[Varsity Cup|FNB Varsity Cup]], a local inter-university rugby tournament, the stadium played host to several games. In all three years (2008–2010) the final also took place at the stadium.  In 2008 the final was played between Maties ([[Stellenbosch University]]) and the Ikey Tigers ([[University of Cape Town]]).

The '''Former Singapore Badminton Hall''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''SBH'''; {{zh|s=新加坡羽毛球馆|p=xīnjiāpō yǔmáoqiúguǎn}}), formerly '''Singapore Badminton Stadium''', is a former [[indoor sports hall]] for [[badminton]] located on [[Guillemard Road]] in [[Geylang]], [[Singapore]]. 

The old facility was previously situated at 100 Guillemard Road. The hall's nearby building (102 Guillemard Road) was formerly the [[headquarter]]s of the [[Singapore Badminton Association]] (SBA). Both buildings were refurnished in May 2009 as the commercial centre [[Guillemard Village]].

The current [[Singapore Badminton Hall]] is located at 1 Lorong 23 Geylang.

==History==
===Construction===
The original Singapore Badminton Stadium was built in 1952 for the [[Thomas Cup Tournament]]. The [[1949 Thomas Cup|first tournament]] was held in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1949, and the [[Federation of Malaya|Malayan]] team won the championship. As a result, Malaya also won the right to host the next Thomas Cup, that was scheduled for 1952. As there was no suitable indoor sports hall in Malaya then, the [[Singapore Badminton Association]] (SBA) decided to build one in Singapore. A [[Fundraising|fund]] to build the badminton hall was launched, after a [[ceremony]] welcoming the victorious Thomas Cup team at the [[Victoria Memorial Hall]].

In February 1951, SBA requested from the [[Singapore Government]] a plot of land at Guillemard Road to build the badminton [[stadium]]. SBA was granted a 99-year [[lease]] on the land, effectively from 1 July the same year, and proceeded to construct the sports hall.

The estimated [[construction]] cost for the hall was [[S$]]200,000 to S$250,000 but the eventual cost rose to S$800,000. [[Donation]]s then totalled only S$32,000. [[Aw Boon Haw]], who was a [[patron]] of the SBA, gave a [[loan]] of S$250,000. Despite this, funds were still short by over S$400,000. Nevertheless, the Badminton Hall Management Committee, headed by Tan Ark Sye, pressed ahead with the construction of the hall. The main [[General contractor|contractor]] was C. H. Tong.

The Singapore Badminton Stadium was completed in May 1952. However, the SBA did not have sufficient funds to cover the total construction cost. Eventually, the hall was relinquished to the [[Singapore Sports Council]] which took over its management in 1978.

===Thomas Cup===
[[File:WongPengteam.jpg|thumb|right|Wong Peng Soon (left), captain of the Malaya Thomas Cup team, being congratulated by Ole Jensen from Denmark (right) at the 1955 Thomas Cup.]]
Although it was completed in May 1952, the Singapore Badminton Stadium was not ready for the [[1952 Thomas Cup|2nd Thomas Cup Tournament]] that was scheduled on 27–28 May that year. The tournament was held at the [[Happy World Stadium]], where the Malayan Team, which included [[Wong Peng Soon]], [[Ong Poh Lim]] and [[Ismail Marjan]], successfully defended their title.

On 7 June 1952, the Singapore Badminton Stadium was officially opened by the [[Governor of Singapore]], Sir [[John Fearns Nicoll]].

In 1955, the [[1955 Thomas Cup|3rd Thomas Cup Tournament]] was held at the Singapore Badminton Hall for the first time. The Malayan Team won its 3rd consecutive title. The [[1958 Thomas Cup|4th Thomas Cup Tournament]] was also held at the badminton hall in June 1958 but the  [[Indonesia]]n team won this time.

===Political events===
[[File:SPTHALL.jpg|right|thumb|People gathered outside the Singapore Badminton Stadium to wait for the results of the referendum to form Malaysia in 1962]]
In June 1959, a crowd of nearly 7,000 workers from 63 [[trade union]]s gathered at the Singapore Badminton Stadium to celebrate the advent of the new government after the [[Singapore general election, 1959|general election]], which was won by the [[People's Action Party]].

On 1 September 1962, the Singapore Badminton Stadium was the [[Vote counting system|vote counting]] station for a [[referendum]] to [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]]'s suggestion to [[merger|merge]] Singapore, [[Brunei]], [[Sarawak]], [[Sabah]] and the [[Federation of Malaya]] to form [[Malaysia]]. About 71 percent of the [[constituency|electorate]] voted for the merger proposal. At 11.15am on 3 September, Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] speaks of 'the clear and decisive verdict' of the people of Singapore for merger with Malaysia, and 'the awful moment of truth' for the Communists. This speech came immediately after the announcement of the Government's victory over the Barisan Socialis-led call to cast blank votes in the referendum.&lt;ref name="Jeanette Wang 2"/&gt; (See: [[Singaporean national referendum, 1962]])

===Concerts===
On 7 December 1959, the Singapore Badminton Stadium was the venue of [[Radio Singapore]]'s all-[[Celebrity|star]] [[variety show]], ''Puspawarna Singapura'', which was hosted by [[P. Ramlee]].

In February 1965, the [[British people|British]] [[rock group]] [[The Rolling Stones]] held a one-night [[performance]] at the Singapore Badminton Stadium. The crowd was so excited that a [[wall]] erected for the [[concert]] collapsed.

===Southeast Asian Games===
On 1 February 1978, the Singapore Sports Council took over the management of the Singapore Badminton Stadium after acquiring a 30-year lease from the Lands Office (now the [[Singapore Land Authority]]). The hall was then [[Renovation|renovated]] and renamed as the '''Singapore Badminton Hall''' and served as the venue for badminton in the [[1983 Southeast Asian Games|12th]] and [[1993 Southeast Asian Games|17th]] [[Southeast Asian Games]], hosted by Singapore in 1983 and 1993 respectively

== Chronicles (1930s – 2013) ==
'''Badminton sports for Singapore (since 1930s)'''

This recreational sport was first introduced to Singapore during the time of the British Colony.&lt;ref name=Tan1&gt;{{cite web | last=Tan | first=J. H. | date=17 October 2002 | title=Badminton in Singapore | accessdate=1 March 2017 | url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_649_2004-12-21.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game, at the beginning, was essentially played within the circle of the affluent British residents in Singapore. Then in the 1930s, the badminton sport gained its popularity among the local population but mainly the upper social class such as the white collar workforce, the social elites from English speaking background. Students from Chinese education played it as well, but badminton might seem to be less wide-spread for the Chinese-educated who were usually less wealthy as compared to the English-educated. Nonetheless, the sport’s wide acceptance certainly had to do with the ease at which how the preparation of the game was made—a minimum of only two players are needed and the court can be anywhere where the ground is flat and the place without wind&lt;ref name=Tan1 /&gt;

The increasing passion for the sports had led to many badminton clubs formed among the local players be it professional or amateur. This was when the [[:de:Singapore Badminton Association|Singapore Badminton Association]] (SBA) was founded in 1929. The association, supported by patrons&lt;ref name=Tan1 /&gt; such as [[Tan Chin Tuan]] (director of the [[OCBC Bank|OCBC]] bank)&lt;ref name=Tuan&gt;{{cite web | author=E. | date=2005 | title=Tan Chin Tuan | accessdate=2 March 2017 | url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_155_2004-12-27.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Song Ong Siang]] (an influential figure of the [[Peranakan|Straits Chinese]] community), aimed to encourage the game and to select the excellent players from various clubs by organising games among the clubs, so as to produce local athletes to participate in the renowned tournaments among the international community.

After [[World War II]], despite of the negative impact on the badminton fever due to the war, local badminton players started to shine in the international stage where the Malayan team won their first championship in the [[Thomas Cup]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=Tan1 /&gt;

'''Construction of The Singapore Badminton Stadium (1949–1952)'''

The winning in 1949 allowed Malaya, particularly the SBA (a sub-association of [[Badminton Association of Malaysia|Malayan Badminton Association]]&lt;ref name=Han&gt;{{cite | last1=Han | first1=L. P., Dr | last2=Aman | first2=M. S., Dr. | title=The Transformation and Development of Badminton as a Global Sport Dominated by Asian Players, Teams, Sponsors and Brands, 1893-2012: Multidisciplinary Perspectives | url=http://www.worldbadminton.com/reference/documents/conference_E047-8th_Asian_Studies_Conference_E_047.pdf | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to hold the next [[Thomas Cup]] Championship at its place since the winners were from Singapore. However, the sports halls available at that time were considered unsuitable for hosting any international tournaments. The President of SBA at that time, Lim Chuan Geok, thus made call for constructing new badminton hall.&lt;ref name=Tan2 /&gt; The construction cost was planned to be funded through public fundraising.

The fundraising was later found to be challenging when the government revealed its plan to construct another stadium at the same time, misleading many to think that the new badminton hall was thus replaced. The diminishing amount of public donations together with the increasing cost of construction hindered the progress of the whole project. A sponsor of SBA, [[Aw Boon Haw]] (founder of "Tiger Balm"), donated a huge sum of money to finance the project&lt;ref name=JohnnyChen&gt;{{cite web | first=Johnny | last=Chen | work=Historical Architecture | location=Singapore | date=31 December 2016 | title=History Served in the Guillemard Road Forecourts | accessdate=1 March 2017 | url=http://www.ghettosingapore.com/history-served-in-the-guillemard-road-forecourts/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The deficit was ultimately absorbed by the building contractor of the hall, C. H. Tong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Badminton Hall hero' is contractor | accessdate=2 March 2017 | url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19520511.2.20 | newspaper=The Straits Times | date=11 May 1952 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, SBA was rendered in debt by the project.

The entire construction was finished in 1952. The Stadium was built to accommodate changing rooms, canteens, offices, 4 badminton courts and 5500 seats[[:File:///C:/Users/ASUS/Desktop/GES1013 Li Mingzhou Singapore Badminton Hall.docx# ftn1|[11]]]. Ironically, the hall dedicated for the Thomas Cup ended up not being used for the incoming Championship because it was thought to be a gamble to let the Malayan team to perform in a hall environment to which they might not become acclimatised yet.&lt;ref name=Tan2 /&gt; The Thomas Cup was held in [[Gay World Amusement Park|Happy World]] Stadium in 1952 instead.

'''1955'''

The hall had its first time hosting the [[Thomas Cup]] Championship which was also the third-time tournament. Again, the Malayan team succeeded in defending their champion title.&lt;ref name=Tan2 /&gt;

'''1958'''

The fourth [[Thomas Cup]] Championship was, too, held in the Singapore Badminton Stadium, but this time round, the Malayan team was defeated by Indonesian team.&lt;ref name=Tan2&gt;{{cite web | last=Tan | first=B. | date=13 December 2011 | title=Former Singapore Badminton Hall | accessdate=1 March 2017 | url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1396_2010-05-10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1959-1960'''

The year 1959 saw mostly the non-sporting events taking place in the Stadium.  The [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) had made public speech to celebrate their victory in the general election. The Hall also served to hold entertainment activities such as dramas, dances and even erotic strip dance by the famous local "Strip Dancing Queen" [[Rose Chan]].&lt;ref name=Tan2 /&gt; In addition, from 1959 to 1960, ''Puspawarna Singapura'', live recordings of variety shows were held by the Radio Singapore&lt;ref name=Tan2 /&gt; with [[P. Ramlee]] (famous Malaysian singer, producer, composer) as the main host. It could be seen that the usage of the sports hall was less strict and exclusive. It might be out of an urge for SBA to increase its source of income and to clear off its debt from the construction.

'''1962'''

In 1962, the Stadium was used as a counting station for the voting over matter of [[Singaporean integration referendum, 1962|Malaya-Singapore merger]] where the People’s Action Party had a clear-cut victory.&lt;ref name=Lionraw&gt;{{cite web | author=N. | date=14 December 2014 | title=Old Singapore Badminton Hall | accessdate=1 March 2017 | url=https://lionraw.com/2014/12/06/old-singapore-badminton-hall/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political significance of the Stadium was clear enough—the hall was a key connection spot between the ruling party and its supporters. On the other hand, during the times of trade union riots, the hall acted as a gathering spot for the unions.&lt;ref name=Tan2 /&gt; Such preference possibly reflected the existence of hall more than just a building but a essential space where political activities or social movements from the working class could be made widely known to the rest of the society.

'''1965'''

A British rock band, [[The Rolling Stones]], conducted their one-stop performance&lt;ref name=Lionraw /&gt; at the badminton stadium. The over-excited spectators resulted in the collapse of a wall.

'''1978'''

Due to SBA’s inability to pay off the debt from construction, the Stadium as well as the remaining debt was taken over by the [[Sport Singapore|Singapore Sports Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=SSC to take over Badminton Hall | accessdate=2 March 2017 | url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19770528-1.2.28.5 | newspaper=The Straits Times | date=28 May 1977 | page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon acquiring the stadium, it was refurbished and renamed as the '''Singapore Badminton Hall'''. The Hall was assigned to be the one of the event venues for the [[Southeast Asian Games]], which had its 12th (Year 1983) and 17th (Year 1993) games hosted in the Hall.&lt;ref name=Opened&gt;{{cite web | title=Singapore Badminton Hall is opened - Singapore History | accessdate=1 March 2017 | url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/b21d2e79-69c6-4c03-b0a0-103fc115edeb#5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1983'''

12th Southeast Asian Game badminton tournament was hosted in the Hall.

'''1986'''

A [[leasehold estate|tenant]], the Fatty Weng [[restaurant]], was opened at the Singapore Badminton Hall in 1986.

'''1993'''

17th Southeast Asian Game badminton tournament was held.

'''1999'''

The Old Singapore Badminton Hall was declared a historical site by the [[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]] to acknowledge its historical significance in 2 major events—the 2 times hosting of Thomas Cup Champions and the vote-counting for 1962 Malaya-Singapore Merger Referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.sportsmuseum.ssc.gov.sg/museum/ssm_cat_details.jsp?type=9&amp;artID=34&amp;root=75&amp;cat=75|title= Singapore Sports Council Sports Museum: Singapore Badminton Hall |accessdate=14 July 2017 |format= |work= [[Singapore Sports Council]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011801/http://www.sportsmuseum.ssc.gov.sg/museum/ssm_cat_details.jsp?type=9&amp;artID=34&amp;root=75&amp;cat=75 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural Features==

'''Style'''

The Old Singapore Badminton Hall appeared to be heavily influenced by the concrete [[Brutalist architecture|brutalism]] though quite a portion of its building was made of metal. The façade at the main entrance has huge sun-breakers as its aesthetic component. The brutalist style here is less prominent as opposed to the other modernist brutalist architectures  because most of the Hall’s façades have been covered by coloured paints to lighten the tone of the concrete.

'''Form'''

The form is a resultant geometry of a terraced pitched roof sitting on top of a rectangular mass. The design approach is relatively simple: a rectangular space accommodates all the programs and a roof to covers the upward opening, while the sun-breakers and openings are made on the façades to reduce heat and increase ventilation in the tropical climate. It could be evident that aesthetics was more or less a secondary consideration for the design and the methodology employed was very [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalistic]].

'''Roof'''

The roof of the hall, like many others at its time, was made of zinc with metallic truss system supported below, imposing a sense of lightness to the overall outlook of the building and reducing its seemingly bulky existence. However, zinc material is considered a poor thermal mass and might adversely affect the indoor climate. That could be the reason why the [[:de:Singapore Badminton Association|SBA]] did not use the Hall for the 2nd Thomas Cup tournament.

'''Structural Support'''

The weight of the roof was spread out in 2 opposite directions and to the 2 facades, and hence it can be deduced that the main entrance façade and the back facade are the load-bearing walls. In the indoor space, the structural elements are the metal trusses as well as the metal frame pillars located at the 2 sides of the hall, freeing up the space in the center.

'''Natural Lighting and Ventilation'''

Most of the openings are positioned at the higher portion of the façades to accommodate natural light and wind into the indoor space without causing strong glares and letting the rains come in. Yet the design ventilation is likely to be ineffective as seemed from the installation of electric fans within the space.

'''The Present and The Past (streetscape)'''

The front entrance of the Hall used to be an ideal spot for gathering due to the vast open space and less traffic flow in the past. Along with the Hall’s fame for hosting various major sports, political and entertainment events, it probably became highly sorted after when it comes to choosing a place to publicise other events. Moving on to the present day, the road space is no longer humanized due to the amount of traffic flow and the greenery space further reduces the size of open area for the Hall. The Hall is now less monumental than it once was.

== Historical site ==
On 1 September 1999, the Singapore Badminton Hall was marked by the [[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]] as a historical site. This was in recognition of the two significant historical events that happened at the hall&amp;mdash;it held two Thomas Cup tournaments and was the vote counting station for the landmark 1962 referendum.&lt;ref name=JohnnyChen /&gt; The ceremony was officiated by [[Abdullah Tarmugi]], [[Minister for Community Development and Sports]].

==Redevelopment==
The building's another [[leasehold estate|tenant]], the Fatty Weng [[restaurant]] which was opened in 1986, moved to [[Smith Street, Singapore|Smith Street]] in [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]] in March 2007 when the SBA was not able to commit to a long-term [[contract]].

In July 2007, the Singapore Badminton Association announced plans to close the Singapore Badminton Hall, after the 30-year lease between the Singapore Sports Council and the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] ceases on 31 January 2008. The SBA's lease is for the badminton hall and its adjacent building, which houses the association's [[office]] and practice [[Court (disambiguation)|court]]s. Its current annual lease of under [[S$]]100,000 would be increased to S$1.164 million if the SBA were to renew it, but the association has no plans to do so. The SBA cited possible sites for its new temporary headquarters at the [[Singapore Sports School]] and [[Anglo-Chinese School (Independent)]]. The SBA will eventually be relocated to the [[Singapore Sports Hub]] in [[Kallang]], due for completion in 2011.&lt;ref name="Jeanette Wang 2"&gt;{{Cite news| author = Jeanette Wang | title = End of an era for Singapore Badminton Hall: Start saying goodbye | publisher = ''[[The Straits Times|The Sunday Times]]'' | date = 29 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeanette Wang"&gt;{{Cite news| author = Jeanette Wang | title = Singapore Badminton Hall likely to close in Jan | publisher = ''[[The Straits Times]]'' | date = 28 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Singapore Badminton Hall closes, the building was returned to the URA. The site of the hall has been zoned for [[sport]]s and [[recreation]] use under URA's Master Plan 2003.

In January 2008, the SBA headquarters and Singapore Badminton Hall was officially closed down after the land lease contract ended and the Singapore Sports Council decided not to renew it given the rising price of the new lease. The Hall was then returned to the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] (URA).&lt;ref name=Opened /&gt;

In May 2009, after a S$2-million refurbishment, the former Singapore Badminton Association building and the former Singapore Badminton Hall started its operation as Guillemard Village under the development by the Turf City Management.&lt;ref name=reborn&gt;{{cite web | title=Badminton hall reborn as F&amp;B, leisure hub | date=13 July 2009 | accessdate=1 March 2017 | url=https://singaporeluxuryhomes.wordpress.com/2009/04/06/badminton-hall-reborn-as-fb-leisure-hub/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was re-developed as a centre for food and beverage as well as leisure. The Hall was deliberately refurbished to give retain the essence of the past, hopefully reminding people of the [[Gay World Amusement Park|Gay World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1396_2010-05-10.html|title=Former Singapore Badminton Hall {{!}} Infopedia|last=Singapore|first=National Library Board,|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, a 24-hour prawn fishing restaurant known as Geylang Prawn Fishing Restaurant was opened, which occupied half of the former sports hall. In August 2011, The restaurant was closed at the hall upon its lease ended and moved to Punggol East Golf Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/New-Geylang-Prawn-Fishing-164685170216633|title=New Geylang Prawn Fishing|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently as of 2013, the most well-known occupants of the Hall are the Brawn &amp; Brains Cafe and the Onsight Climbing Gym.&lt;ref name=Lionraw /&gt;

{{Cricket deliveries}}
A '''full toss''' is a type of [[delivery (cricket)|delivery]] in the [[sport]] of [[cricket]]. It describes any delivery that reaches the [[batsman]] without bouncing on the [[cricket pitch|pitch]] first.

A full toss which reaches the batsman above the waist is called a [[beamer (cricket)|beamer]]. This is not a valid delivery and will lead to a [[no-ball]] penalty, but, like the [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]], is sometimes used as an intimidation tactic. 

Other types of full toss are rarely deliberate, as they can be very easy to hit. A low full toss is frequently the result of an error made while attempting to bowl a [[yorker]], which bounces at the batsman's feet. Occasionally a full toss can surprise a batsman so effectively that he is unable to play it properly, and this can lead to a [[wicket]], but few [[bowler (cricket)|bowlers]] rely on this. 

There have been occasions in which a bowler intentionally bowls a full toss to achieve maximum swing into the base of the stumps. This was commonly seen with [[Waqar Younis]] and [[Wasim Akram]] of Pakistan, though recently [[Lasith Malinga]] of [[Sri Lanka]] has been bowling low full tosses with his unorthodox round arm action.

== Plot ==
The film begins in 1914 on the eve of the outbreak of [[World War I]] set during [[Gavrilo Princip|Gavrilo Princip's]] departure before the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]].

The main events unfold in [[St. Petersburg]] with the story being centered around two brothers, Andrei and Nikolai. In the past, their father was either a sports patron or just interested in football. He put all his money on the Russian football team which lost to the Germans [[Football at the 1912 Summer Olympics|in Stockholm in 1912]] with a crushing score of 0:16. He went broke and became insane. Their mother died after some time and the brothers now live in the apartment of their uncle, a doctor, and they are also keen on football. Their team also includes Shust and goalkeeper Misha (whom the brothers nickname as Tolstiy).

Meanwhile Andrei becomes the lover of Anitsa, a young widow who sometime ago came from [[Belgrade]]. Anitsa receives famous poets at her home, at one evening it is possible to see [[Osip Mandelstam]], [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Vladislav Khodasevich]]. She is also friends with [[Alexander Blok]], whom Nikolai is also acquainted with.

After reading an ad in a newspaper that the British, who work in St. Petersburg, create their own football teams, the brothers also go for try-outs, but they are not taken in. They dream of building their own football field, and decide to purchase an empty piece of land. Shust makes a deal with the Tartar Torgash, who calls a high price (140 rubles) because he has unpaid debts. To collect the right amount the team of Andrei and Nikolai begins to play football for money with local teams.

In St. Petersburg to Anitsa arrives her sister Vita with a little boy whom she calls her brother (before this, Vita and the boy appear in the scene of the departure of Princip). Vita becomes close to Nikolai and suggests to him to take her as his wife. However when Shust brings Torgash the collected money, Vita and Shust are killed by thugs with whom Torgash is in debt.

Anitsa and Vita's boy leave the city. Nikolai goes to the front. Andrei meets Nina whom he previously courted and marries her. Nikolai arrives from the front when there is famine in Petrograd, which has been renamed. Andrei and Nina live with their child in the apartment of their uncle (who like Nikolai and Andrei's father has already died). Andrei tries to get food at the House of Writers and meets Blok with a pot of potatoes and herring. The brothers go to the wasteland where they wanted to build a field, Nikolai takes out the ball brought from the war, and they begin to play and build new plans.

'''General strength exercises''' are the [[physical exercise]]s that are used in overall [[body conditioning]].  They are not directly related to the specific actions seen in a specific sport (i.e., strengthening the muscles as they are used in a specific sport and increasing an athlete's functional potential for improved performance).&lt;ref&gt;Yessis, Michael. ''Build A Better Athlete''. Equilibrium Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[overhead press]] exercise which is used by [[runners]] can illustrate the concept of a general strength exercise.  It is a common exercise in which the arms move directly upward overhead.  In [[running]], however, the arms move in a forward-backward motion in relation to the trunk.  Thus, the overhead press is a good exercise for [[strengthening]] the shoulders and arms, but, even though it uses some of the same [[muscles]] that are involved in running, it is not directly related to running.&lt;ref&gt;Yessis, Michael. ''Explosive Running''. Ultimate Athlete Concepts, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

If an athlete has weak shoulders this exercise can improve strength capabilities &lt;ref&gt;Zatsiorski, Vladimir and Kramer, William.  "Science and Practice of Strength Training". Human Kinetics, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which may indirectly help an athlete's arms during a run.  This exercise is not, however, as effective as an exercise in which the arm and shoulder movements duplicate the exact action (pathway) seen in running.  This is known as a specialized exercise.  An example of a specialized exercise for the shoulders is driving the arm from behind the body to in front of the body in the same pathway and in the same range of motion as seen in the running stride.

The key to improving athletic performance is to perform general exercises to develop a base and to then perform special exercises that duplicate the movements and actions seen in the actual skills execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Yuri V.Verkoshansky |title=Programming and Organization of Sports training |publisher=Sportiviny Press|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, the development of the physical abilities that are specific to any sport will have the greatest impact on maintaining or improving the athlete's ability to perform better.

Because of the need for skill duplication most exercises are best done with rubber tubing as in the Active Cords set.  The cords are especially important for the leg, hip and shoulder actions.  The reason for this is that it is very difficult and in some cases impossible, to duplicate the exact movements of the legs, hips and shoulders with [[dumbbells]], [[barbells]] or machines.  [[Medicine ball]] exercises are also used for [[Physical strength|strength]] and explosive muscular development.

'''[[Grenada]]''' competed at the '''[[2004 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation's sixth consecutive appearance at the Olympics.

Grenada Olympic Committee sent a total of five athletes (three men and two women), competing only in athletics and swimming. Track runner and world indoor champion [[Alleyne Francique]] was appointed by the committee to become the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2004 Athens: Flag Bearers for the Opening Ceremony|url=http://www.olympic.org/content/news/media-resources/manual-news/1999-2009/2004/08/13/flag-bearers-for-the-opening-ceremony/|publisher=[[Olympics]]|date=13 August 2004|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A top favorite in the men's 400 metres, Francique narrowly missed a chance to grab the nation's first ever Olympic medal with a fantastic fourth-place finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wariner wins 400m final|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics_2004/athletics/3592420.stm|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=23 August 2004|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan cricket team]] made its Test cricket debut in 1952 and has since become one of the most successful teams in modern cricket. The team reached the semi-finals of the 1979,1983, 1987 and 2011 World Cups, and finals in 1992 and 1999, and won the 1992 ICC Cricket World Cup by defeating England in the final with the captaincy of Imran Khan They are one of the most successful T20 sides but faced a big failure in T20 2016 having won the T20 World Cup in 2009 and been runner-up in 2007. And after that they have defeated India by big margin of 180 in the Final of Champions Trophy 2017 at Oval.Pakistan has also been ranked as the Number 1 Test Team twice (summers of 1988 &amp; 2016) and Number 1 across all formats (Test, ODI and T20) at various points. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketworldcupinformation.com/2014/08/team-pakistan-at-cricket-world-cup.html Pakistan Cricket Team performances at World Cups]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|History of the Indian cricket team|Cricket in Pakistan}}

After the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, and the establishment of the separate nation state of Pakistan, cricket in the country developed steadily and Pakistan was given [[Test cricket|Test Match]] status at a meeting of the [[International Cricket Council|Imperial Cricket Conference]] at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] on 28 July 1952 following recommendation by India,&lt;ref&gt;'''Guinness Cricket Encyclopaedia'''&lt;/ref&gt; which, being the successor state of the [[British Raj]], did not have to go through such a process.

Pakistan's first Test match was played in [[Feroz Shah Kotla|Delhi]] in October 1952 as part of a five Test series which [[India national cricket team|India]] won 2–1. Pakistan made their first tour of England in 1954 and drew the series 1–1 after a memorable victory at [[The Oval]] in which fast bowler [[Fazal Mahmood]] took 12 wickets. Pakistan's first home Test match was in [[Dacca]] in January 1955 against India, after which four more Test matches were played in [[Bahawalpur]], [[Lahore]], [[Peshawar]] and [[Karachi]] (all five matches in the series were drawn, the first such occurrence in test history&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/sports_talk/stump_bearders/5159010.stm Stump the Bearded Wonder No 126]: '''BBC Sport''' Retrieved 28 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The team is considered strong but unpredictable. Traditionally Pakistani cricket has had players of great talent but limited discipline, making them a team which could play inspirational cricket one day and then perform less than ordinarily another day. Over the years, competitions between India and Pakistan have always been emotionally charged and provide for intriguing contests, as talented teams from both sides of the border elevate their game to new levels to produce high-quality cricket. Pakistan's matches against India in the [[Cricket World Cup]] have seen packed stadiums and heightened atmospheres no matter where the World Cup has been held.

===1986 Australasia Cup ===
1986 Australasia Cup, played in [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]], is remembered as a famous last-ball victory for Pakistan against arch-rivals India, with [[Javed Miandad]] emerging as a national hero.&lt;ref name = "miandad_six"&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/255480.html Going, going...gone]. ''[[Cricinfo.com]].'' Retrieved on 14 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

India batted first and set a target of 245 runs, leaving Pakistan with a required run rate of 4.92 runs per over. [[Javed Miandad]] came in to bat at number 3, and Pakistan lost wickets at regular intervals. Later recalling the match, Miandad stated that his main focus was to lose with dignity. With 31 runs needed in the last three overs, Miandad hit a string of boundaries while batting with his team's lower order, until four runs were required from the last delivery of the match. Miandad received a [[leg side]] [[full toss]] from [[Chetan Sharma]], which he hit for six over the midwicket boundary.&lt;ref name = miandad_six/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1980S/1985-86/OD_TOURNEYS/AA/IND_PAK_AA_ODI-FINAL_18APR1986.html Austral-Asia Cup, 1985/86, Final, India v Pakistan]. ''[[Cricinfo.com]].'' Retrieved on 14 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1992 World Cup Semi Final ===

After winning the toss, New Zealand chose to bat first and ended with a total of 262. Pakistan batted conservatively yet lost wickets at regular intervals. With the departure of Imran Khan and [[Saleem Malik]] shortly thereafter, Pakistan still required 115 runs at a rate of 7.67 per over with veteran [[Javed Miandad]] being the only known batsman remaining at the crease. A young [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]], who had just turned 22 and was not a well-known player at the time, burst onto the international stage with a match-winning 60 off 37 balls. Once Inzamam got out, Pakistan required 36 from 30 balls, which wicketkeeper [[Moin Khan]] ended with a towering six over long off, followed by the winning boundary to midwicket. The match is seen as the emergence of Inzamam onto the international stage.&lt;ref name = "inzi_arrival"&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/284421.html Inzi announces his arrival, and India's hat-trick hero].

=== 1992 World Cup Victory ===

The [[1992 Cricket World Cup]] in Australia &amp; New Zealand marked Pakistan's first World Cup victory. It is remembered for the comeback Pakistan made after losing key players such as [[Waqar Younis]] and [[Saeed Anwar]], and being led by an injured captain [[Imran Khan]]. Pakistan won only 1 of their first 5 matches including a 1 no-result and were nearly eliminated in the first round of the tournament after being bowled out for 74 against England, until the match was declared as a "no result" due to rain. Captain Imran Khan famously told the team to play as "cornered tigers", after which Pakistan won five successive matches, including, most famously, the semi-final against hosts New Zealand and the final against England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/264386.html Imran's Tigers turn the corner]. ''[[Cricinfo.com]].'' Retrieved on 14 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the most important part of the final was the two important wickets of WASIM AKRAM he got in 44th over which made Pakistan win the WORLD CUP. That was the first time Pakistan won cricket world cup.

=== 2007 World Cup Shock ===

Pakistan participated in one of the biggest upsets in World Cup History when they were knocked out of the competition in a shock defeat to [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]], who were playing in their first competition. Pakistan, needing to win to qualify for the next stage after losing to the West Indies in their opening match, wereput into bat by Ireland on a green pitch. They lost wickets regularly and only 4 batsmen crossed double figures. In the end they were bowled out by the resurgent Irish for 132. The Irish went on to win the match, helped by a knock of 72 from [[Niall O'Brien (cricketer)|Niall O'Brien]]. This meant that Pakistan had been knocked out during the first round for the second consecutive World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/285704.html Pakistan sent home by bold Ireland].

Retrieved on 14 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tragedy struck the team when coach [[Bob Woolmer]] died one day later on 18 March 2007 in a hospital in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. Jamaican police spokesman, Karl Angell, reported on 23 March 2007 that, "Mr Woolmer's death was due to [[asphyxiation]] as a result of manual strangulation", and that, "Mr Woolmer's death is now being treated by the Jamaica police as a case of murder."&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/286794.html Police hunt Woolmer's murderer]: '''Cricinfo.com''' Retrieved 24 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to his team's defeat and the death of Bob Woolmer, Inzamam-ul-Haq announced his resignation as captain of the team and his retirement from one-day cricket, stating that he would continue to take part in Test cricket but not as captain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/286039.html Shattered Inzamam retires from one-day scene]: '''Cricinfo.com''' Retrieved 24 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March 2007, Pakistan players and officials were questioned by Jamaican police and submitted DNA samples along with fingerprints, as part of the routine enquiries in the investigation into Woolmer's murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/current/story/286876.html DNA testing for Pakistan players]: '''Cricinfo.com''' Retrieved 7 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after leaving the West Indies for Pakistan, via London, the Pakistan team were ruled out as suspects. The deputy commissioner of Jamaican police. Mark Shields, the detective in charge of the investigation, announced, "It's fair to say they are now being treated as witnesses." "I have got no evidence to suggest it was anybody in the squad."&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/287377.html Pakistan no longer suspects in Woolmer case]: '''Cricinfo.com''' Retrieved 7 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial service was held in Sacred Heart Church, Lahore, for Bob Woolmer on 1 April 2007. Among the attendees were Pakistan players and dignitaries, including Inzamam-ul-Haq, who was quoted as saying, "After Woolmer's family, the Pakistan team was the most aggrieved by his death."&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/woolmer/content/current/story/288347.html Memorial service for Woolmer held in Lahore]: '''Cricinfo.com''' Retrieved 7 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After the World Cup ended, serious doubts were raised about the investigation, with increasing speculation that Woolmer died of natural causes. This has now been accepted as fact, and the case has been closed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/woolmer/content/current/story/295091.html Doubts grow over pathologist's findings]. ''[[Cricinfo.com]].'' Retrieved on 21 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 July 2007, [[Geoff Lawson (cricketer)|Geoff Lawson]], previously head coach of New South Wales, was appointed coach of the Pakistan for two years, becoming the third foreigner to take on the role.&lt;ref name = "lawson_coach"&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/302186.html Lawson named Pakistan coach]. ''[[Cricinfo.com]].'' Retrieved on 2007-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]], Pakistan exceeded expectations to reach the final but ended as runners-up, after losing the final to India in a nail-biting finish. On 25 October 2008, [[Intikhab Alam]] was named as a national coach of the team by the [[Pakistan Cricket Board|PCB]].

===Player disputes and rebellions===
The Pakistan team has been marred by player disputes and rebellions within the team on various instances. The first such reported instance was in 1981, when ten players including [[Imran Khan]], [[Asif Iqbal (cricketer, born 1943)|Asif Iqbal]] and [[Majid Khan (cricketer, born 1946)|Majid Khan]]  refused to play under the captaincy of Javed Miandad.&lt;ref name="fights"&gt;[http://www.pakistanherald.com/Article.aspx?chk=1&amp;art_id=2510 Players revolt under Javed Miandad]&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Once again, in 1992 Miandad was the target of another revolt this time led by Wasim Akram with the support of now retired Imran Khan. This led to Miandad being replaced with Akram.
Later in 1993, when [[Wasim Akram]] was appointed captain of the national team, players including [[Waqar Younis]] and [[Javed Miandad]] revolted against him and Akram was removed as captain. Akram did regain captaincy again in 1996 and then again in 1998-99.&lt;ref name="fights"/&gt;

In 2009, many senior players revolted against captain [[Younis Khan]] when the team was playing in the UAE against New Zealand. Press reports say that a group of eight players led by [[Shoaib Malik]] went to the house of former captain [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]], where they swore on the Quran to never play under Younis again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-05-07/top-stories/28283035_1_shahid-afridi-rana-naved-younis-khan Player take oath not to play under Younis]&lt;/ref&gt; Sensing the direction of the wind, Younis left the team for "rest" and the captaincy was awarded to [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricketer, born 1974)|Mohammad Yousuf]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/434064.html Younis resigns as captain, wants rest]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
On the subsequent Australian tour, differences between Yousaf and the other players came to the forefront, causing Yousaf to give the captaincy of the fifth ODI to Shahid Afridi. Shoaib Malik, captain the team in the T20 (after Afridi was suspended due to ball tampering), started a tirade against Yousaf.&lt;br&gt;
The above-mentioned revolt lead to an operation cleanup within the Pakistan team, when selectors were asked not to consider Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousaf for any future series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakool.com/sports/mohammad-yousaf-younis-khan-handed-lifetime-bans-while-shoaib-malik-and-rana-naved-banned-for-one-year/ Yousaf, Younis banned for life]&lt;/ref&gt;

This device is usually small and attaches to a runner's foot.  It uses one or more [[accelerometer]]s and processes several times a second to compute speed.

One example is the foot pod employed by the [[Polar S625x]] running computer.

'''Kim Gwang-suk''' (alternative transliteration '''Kim Kwang-suk''', {{Korean|김광숙}}; born 15 February, year unknown; 1976 or 1978 theorized) is a [[North Korea]]n female [[gymnast]] who competed in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]]. She is known for both her exemplary [[uneven bars]] work and for her involvement in one of the most prominent [[Age controversies in gymnastics|age falsification scandals]] in gymnastics in recent years.

Kim competed in several major international senior meets between 1989 and 1993, including the 1989 and 1991 World Championships, the 1990 [[Asian Games]] and the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]]. She was the 1991 World Champion on the uneven bars, winning the event with a perfect 10.0 score and a routine that included an original release move, the Counter-Kim. Her ten would be the very last to ever be awarded in World Championship competition.

Due to her small stature and the fact that the North Korean Gymnastics Federation listed her given age as 15 for three consecutive years, questions arose about Kim's age and eligibility for senior competition. By at least one estimate, she was as young as 11 when she competed at the 1989 World Championships. While her real age was never ascertained, it was discovered that the Federation had submitted inconsistent birth year information for her at least three times at three separate international competitions. As a result of the falsification, the North Korean women's gymnastics team was banned from the 1993 World Championships.

== Gymnastics career ==
Kim was trained by coach Kim Chun-phi&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcckp.net/en/periodic/korea/index.php?contents+1568+2006-12+58+18 Profile of Hong Un-Jong, ''Pyongyang Times'', Ri Hak-Myong]&lt;/ref&gt; and was appearing on the international competitive circuit as early as 1987, when she performed at the Junior Friendship Tournament (Druzhba), winning a bronze medal on the uneven bars.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um6H4CF7R4Y Home video footage of Kim at the 1987 Druzhba meet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.gymn-forum.net/bios/women/kim_gwang_suk.html Biography and list of results] Gymn-Forum&lt;/ref&gt; She continued on to other international meets at both the junior and senior levels, including the 1988 Cottbus Cup, part of the World Cup circuit, where she placed a modest 17th in the all-around, and that year's Druzhba meet, where she once again placed third on bars and won an additional bronze with the North Korean team.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

The following year, 1989, Kim participated in the [[1989 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] with the North Korean team. While she finished out of the medals on every event, her innovative uneven bars routine attracted attention. Her set would still be considered exceptionally difficult by modern standards, with intricate combinations of pirouettes and releases. Kim also performed her own original release move, a Tkatchev-front flip toward the high bar. The skill came to be known in the ''[[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]]'' as the Counter-Kim; as of the 2008 ''Code of Points,'' it was classified as a difficult 'F' element. In 1990 Kim won a silver medal on bars and finished 4th on beam at the [[Asian Games]] in [[Beijing]].

Kim's efforts were finally rewarded at the [[1991 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|1991 World Championships]], where she earned the uneven bars gold medal in event finals with a perfect 10.0 score. She was expected to challenge for bars gold at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, however, a step on her dismount kept her in fourth place (tied with two Romanians, [[Lavinia Miloşovici]] and [[Mirela Paşca]]), just out of the medals. Her final major competition was the 1993 [[East Asian Games]], where she won the uneven bars title. Her score was initially given at 9.912, which kept her in second place behind China's Luo Li (who went on to win the uneven bars world title in 1994). North Korean team officials filed a protest and Kim's score was adjusted to 9.925, giving Kim a tie for the gold with Luo.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

== Age falsification scandal ==
While the gymnastics community praised Kim's performances, they also questioned her age: Kim was tiny even by gymnastics standards, and many people believed she was too young for senior competition. 

At the 1991 Worlds, television commentators made several remarks about Kim's supposed age of 15.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;ABC-TV coverage of the 1991 World Championships event finals&lt;/ref&gt; When Kim appeared at the Olympics the following year with missing front teeth, standing 4'4", weighing 62 pounds and claiming to be 17 years old, the skepticism grew, with several officials and coaches publicly voicing their doubts,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;NBC coverage of the 1992 Olympics team compulsories&lt;/ref&gt; to the point where [[NBC]] mentioned the controversy in their television broadcasts to American audiences.&lt;ref&gt;NBC-TV coverage of the 1992 Olympics event finals&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytnew&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/sports/olympics/27gymnasts.html?_r=2&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin "Issues of Age Seem to Follow Chinese Gymnasts"], Jere Longman, Juliet Macur. ''The New York Times'', July 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim's coaches claimed that she had lost her teeth in a training mishap several years before the Olympics,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and this story was corroborated by photographs from past events, witnesses and video footage of Kim without teeth at the 1991 Worlds.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, there was still no way to explain away the numerous inconsistencies with Kim's age. 

It was eventually discovered that North Korean officials had falsified Kim's birth year at least three occasions, supplying different information at different competitions. The forgeries had been inconsistent at best, as Kim's age was given as 15 for three consecutive years, but at the Barcelona Olympics in July 1992, her age jumped to 17.&lt;ref name=nytnew /&gt;&lt;ref name="iht"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080824173513/http://www.iht.com/articles/1996/04/19/gym.t.php "Gold Medalist and His Team May Be Barred From Olympic Games : Last Chance for a North Korean Athlete"], Christopher Clarey, ''International Herald Times'', Friday, April 19, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; By at least one estimate, she was no older than 11 or 12 when she competed at the 1989 World Championships,&lt;ref name="iht" /&gt; and at the team portion of the 1992 Olympics, [[Béla Károlyi]] suggested she may have been as young as 10 at the time: he remarked, "Her [[baby teeth|milk teeth]] are falling out, which is a good indication she's not even 11."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The FIG punished the North Korean gymnastics federation by barring their women's team from competeting at the [[1993 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|1993 World Championships]].&lt;ref name=iht /&gt; Kim, however, was permitted to keep the medals she had won in international events, including her 1991 World Championships gold, as she was determined to have no involvement or knowledge in the fraud. 

The same year, her country's government honored her by including her in a series of [[postage stamps]] commemorating North Korean world champion athletes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceandastronomystamps.com/prk.xhtml Partial list of 1993 PRK postage stamps]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, Kim's real age has never been conclusively determined, and is left blank in her FIG profile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://figfront.lx2.sportcentric.com/athletes?athlete%5Bfirst_name%5D=&amp;athlete%5Blast_name%5D=kim&amp;athlete%5Bdiscipline_id%5D=3&amp;athlete%5Bcountry_id%5D=&amp;athlete%5Bcode%5D=&amp;athlete%5Bfilter_licenced%5D=0&amp;athlete%5Bstatus%5D=&amp;display=&amp;athlete%5Bdisc%5D=&amp;commit=Search# Official FIG profile for Kim Gwang Suk]&lt;/ref&gt; Birth years given by the North Korean Federation ranged from 1974 to 1976, and late 1990s reports by the Korean News Service claimed that she was 14 years old in both 1989 and 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/1998/9802/news02/20.htm "Gymnastic movements created by DPRK players"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929222533/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/1998/9802/news02/20.htm |date=2008-09-29 }} Korean News Service, February 20, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/1999/9909/news09/07.htm "Korean athletes startle world"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929220758/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/1999/9909/news09/07.htm |date=2008-09-29 }}, Korean News Service, September 7, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Some people believe Kim was born in 1976, but the more accepted consensus is that her birth year was actually 1978 or even 1979. 

The rationale behind this estimate is that the North Korean Federation was still supplying inconsistent birth dates for Kim in 1991 and 1992: if she had been born in 1976 or 1977, this would not have been necessary, as to be age-eligible to participate in the 1991 Worlds and 1992 Olympics, gymnasts had to be born on or before 31 December 1977.

Little is known about Kim apart from her competitive history. In April 2008, she briefly appeared in public in Pyongyang as a torchbearer during the North Korean portion of the Olympic torch relay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/photo/2008-04/28/content_8067565.htm North Korea torch relay coverage (in Chinese)] Qi Hengshe, Xinhuanet news service April 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mid-South Coliseum''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] located in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] that seated 10,085 people. It was built in 1963&lt;ref name="mid" /&gt; and closed in 2006.

==History==

===Rock concerts===
The arena was one of the few stops on [[The Beatles]]' final American tour. The group played two concerts there on August 19, 1966. The evening performance is infamously known as "the [[firecracker]] concert", due to a crowd member exploding a firecracker (which some thought was a gunshot) during the show. Prior to the concert, a remote television news feed, with the arena in the background, shows a [[Ku Klux Klan]]sman promising "a few surprises" for the group. This interview was in response to [[John Lennon]]'s statement that The Beatles had become more popular than [[Jesus Christ]].

[[Elvis Presley]] also performed at the arena. His first show was on March 16, 1974, which was his first Memphis concert since 1961. The album ''Recorded Live On Stage In Memphis'' was the concert from March 20, 1974. Elvis's last concert at the arena was on July 5, 1976.  ''Elvis In Concert 1997 — The 20th Anniversary Concert'' was held at the arena and mark the first concert for the ''Elvis, The Concert''.

English [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Judas Priest]] brought out a live DVD in 2006 that was recorded on 12 December 1982 under the name of [[Live Vengeance '82]].

Canadian singer [[Celine Dion]] performed a two-night stand at the arena on March 14 and 15, 1997 as part of her [[Falling Into You Around the World Tour]]. The shows were filmed and the concert aired on television. It was also released on VHS in November 1998 under the title [[Live in Memphis (Celine Dion video)|Live in Memphis]].

===Professional wrestling===
The Mid-South Coliseum was also well known in [[professional wrestling]] as the home base for the [[United States Wrestling Association]] and its predecessors; [[Jerry Lawler]] headlined hundreds of shows at the facility.&lt;ref&gt;prowrestlinghistory.com, [http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/memphis/index.html "The History of Wrestling at the Mid-South Coliseum"] Retrieved 2008-01-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among many notable events, Lawler faced [[Terry Funk]] in an "empty arena fight" at the Coliseum in 1981. On April 5, 1982, Lawler piledrove comedian Andy Kaufman twice, ending a match between the two in disqualification. Kaufman was taken away in an ambulance.

===Hockey===
The Mid-South Coliseum served as the home of the original [[Central Professional Hockey League|Central Hockey League]] team, the [[Memphis Wings]] (later the [[Memphis South Stars]]) from 1964 through 1969. To accommodate hockey, piping was installed beneath the Coliseum's floor surface. The ice was often left intact between games, allowing Memphis residents to partake in public skating.

In 1992, the [[Mississippi RiverKings|Memphis RiverKings]] of the newly re-formed Central Hockey League brought a successful return of professional hockey to the Mid-South Coliseum, drawing good crowds from 1992–2000. Trying political circumstances prevented much needed updates from being made to the Coliseum, resulting in the RiverKings moving to the new DeSoto Civic Center, now [[Lander's Center]], in [[Southaven, Mississippi]] in 2000.

===Indoor soccer===
The [[Memphis Rogues]] played the [[1979–80 NASL Indoor season|1979–80 season]] of NASL [[indoor soccer]] at the Coliseum. The Rogues won the Western Division and went all the way to the finals, winning Game 1 of the series, 5–4 at home in front of 9,081 fans&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19800301&amp;id=ZQMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I1oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6199,232817&lt;/ref&gt; before losing Game 2 and the mini-game tie breaker to the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975–93)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] at the [[Bayfront Center]].&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19800303&amp;id=t3FQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I1oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4715,2996499&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basketball==

===ABA Franchise: History in Memphis at the Coliseum===
{{Portal|Basketball}}

The Coliseum was home to the [[American Basketball Association]] Memphis franchise. The team was called the [[Memphis Pros]] (1971–1972), the [[Memphis Tams]] (1972–1974) and the [[Memphis Sounds]] (1974–1975). After the [[New Orleans Buccaneers]] moved upriver to Memphis in 1971, the Memphis Pros struggled in their first season. The team was then purchased by baseball [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland A's]] owner [[Charlie Finley]], who renamed them the Tams and briefly hired legendary Kentucky coach [[Adolph Rupp]] as team President. After Finley sold the team, the renamed Sounds also struggled in 1974–75. The franchise left Memphis for Baltimore in 1975, becoming the [[Baltimore Claws]] and folded before playing a regular season game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/Memphis-Tams.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102054457/http://www.remembertheaba.com/Memphis-Tams.html |archivedate=2015-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an ABA arena the Coliseum, with the Pros and Sounds, hosted the [[Indiana Pacers]] during the [[1971 ABA Playoffs|1971 Western Division Semifinals]]&lt;ref name="remembertheaba.com71"&gt;[http://www.remembertheaba.com/PlayoffPages/1971Playoffs.html RememberTheABA.com 1971 Playoffs Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611213734/http://www.remembertheaba.com/PlayoffPages/1971Playoffs.html |date=2015-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kentucky Colonels]] during the [[1975 ABA Playoffs|1975 Eastern Division Finals]];&lt;ref name="remembertheaba.com75"&gt;[http://www.remembertheaba.com/PlayoffPages/1975Playoffs.html RememberTheABA.com 1975 ABA Playoffs Page] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kJBwuE8t?url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/PlayoffPages/1975Playoffs.html |date=2009-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Pacers went on to win the [[1971 ABA Finals|1971 ABA Championship]]&lt;ref name="remembertheaba.com71"/&gt; and the Colonels went on to win the [[1975 ABA Finals|1975 ABA Championship]].&lt;ref name="remembertheaba.com75"/&gt;

== Memphis Tigers ==
It was home to the [[University of Memphis]] Tigers [[basketball]] team (then known as Memphis State University) before the [[Memphis Pyramid|Pyramid]] opened in 1991 and the [[Mississippi RiverKings|Memphis RiverKings]] before the [[DeSoto Civic Center]] opened in 2000. The Coliseum also hosted five [[Metro Conference]] men's basketball tournaments.

==Closure==
The venue closed at the end of 2006, when Memphis and Shelby County Governments refused the request from the Mid-South Coliseum Board to pay its operating losses, which were projected to be $1 million a year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rctimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061124/NEWS01/611240429/1006/MTCN0301&lt;/ref&gt; The coliseum also needed renovations to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highgroundnews.com/features/MidSouthColiseum070914.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Its final event was a concert by [[The All American Rejects]].

The sports complex has the following components: the Homer and Ruth Drake Field House, the William H. Anderson II Family Field, the Marshall and Jane Butler Family Plaza, and the Tony and Nancy Moye Family Football and Lacrosse Complex.  Messrs. Drake, Anderson, Butler, and Moye are university [[board of directors|trustees]] and were major donors towards the stadium.  

On February 26, 2015, the stadium portion of the complex was named Five Star Stadium in recognition of a multimillion-dollar financial commitment to Mercer athletics by Five Star Automotive Group, which owns dealerships in Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Shirley, [http://www.macon.com/2015/02/26/3607640_mercer-footballlacrosse-stadium.html?rh=1 "Mercer football/lacrosse stadium renamed following major donation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227083318/http://www.macon.com/2015/02/26/3607640_mercer-footballlacrosse-stadium.html?rh=1 |date=2015-02-27 }}, ‘’The Telegraph’’, February 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  The president of Five Star Automotive Group, Charlie Cantrell, is also president of the Mercer Athletic Foundation.

The complex is located adjacent to Mercer's other athletic facilities including [[Hawkins Arena]] ([[basketball]] and athletic department offices), [[Claude Smith Field]] ([[baseball]]), and Sikes Field ([[softball]]).  There is a 101-room [[Hilton Garden Inn]] on university-owned land adjacent to the complex.  Parking lots are available for visitors-spectators arriving via the Mercer University Drive exit off of [[Interstate 75]].  

Mercer has an [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] athletic program and fields teams in eight men's and ten women's sports; all university-sponsored sports compete in the [[Southern Conference]] except women's [[college lacrosse|lacrosse]] and women's [[beach volleyball|sand volleyball]], which are not sponsored by the SoCon, and thus compete in the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mercer.edu/articles/2013/mercer-university-accepts-invitation-to-join-the-southern-conference.cfm#.Ucj1aOUo7IV|title=Mercer University Accepts Invitation to Join the Southern Conference|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mercer.edu/articles/2014/mercer-joins-southern-conference.cfm#.U7MveVPD_IV|title=Dawn of a New Era: Mercer Joins Southern Conference|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nigerian Open''' is (or was) a [[golf]] tournament in [[Nigeria]]. Founded in 1969, it was a [[Challenge Tour]] event between 1990 and 1993, having previously been part of what was known as the Safari Tour.

The Safari Tour can be traced back to the sixties, when British professionals escaped the northern European winter and taught at clubs throughout Africa. Many of the professionals also took their assistants with them to gain extra experience, and as the numbers involved in these tours increased, so events in the host countries evolved. The driving force behind the African events was [[Dai Rees]], who would liaise with local sponsors and organisers on behalf of the professionals. By 1975, the size of the Safari Tour had become too much to administer, and so the European Tournament Players' Division (now known as [[European Tour]]) took over the representation of the professionals. As the European Tour began to expand its schedule globally, in 1991 the five Safari Tour events became part of the developmental Challenge Tour.

In 1981, [[England]]'s [[Peter Tupling]] set the record low 72 hole score in professional tournament golf, when he won the title with a 29 under par total of 255.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/golf/article1121144.ece |title=Matharu hints at bright future on day in sun |publisher=[[The Times]] |date=March 19, 2003 |accessdate=2008-11-26 | location=London | first=John | last=Hopkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable past champions include major winners [[Vijay Singh]] and [[Sandy Lyle]] and former Ryder Cup player [[Gordon J. Brand]].

The '''Pan American Sports Organization''' ('''Panam Sports'''; {{lang-es|Organización Deportiva Panamericana}}) is an [[international organization]] which represents the current 41 [[National Olympic Committee]]s of [[North America]], [[South America]], Central America and the Caribbean.

It is affiliated with the [[International Olympic Committee]] and its affiliated bodies, including ANOC, the [[Association of National Olympic Committees]], and serves as the continental association of the Americas.

The organization's flagship event is the quadrennial [[Pan American Games]], held since 1951. The [[Parapan American Games]] were inaugurated in 1999 for [[disabled athletes]] and are held alongside the able-bodied Pan American Games. The [[Pan American Winter Games]], for winter sports, were held only once in 1990. The [[Pan American Sports Festival]] was inaugurated in 2014 as a developmental event for the region's athletes.

==Affiliated organizations==
There are four regional entities affiliated with Panam Sports, they are:
* [[ODESUR]] – organizers of the [[South American Games]]
* [[CASCO]] – organizers of the [[Central American and Caribbean Games]]
* [[ORDECA]] – organizers of the [[Central American Games]]
* [[ODEBO]] – organizers of the [[Bolivarian Games]]

==Flag==
Just like the International Olympic Committee, Panam Sports has its own flag. In 2017, Panam Sports underwent a complete rebranding of the organization, including changes to its commercial name (now '''Panam Sports'''), brand and flag. The modern design emphasizes the unity of Panam Sports' 41 member nations, displaying the entire continent within a seal that features the new commercial name 'Panam Sports' at the top and 'Organization' at the bottom. The Olympic Rings reside below the seal, symbolizing the continental organization's close relationship with the IOC and the Olympic Games. The seal and accompanying rings are centered on the white background of the flag.

The original flag of PASO-ODEPA contained the four words, "América", "Espírito", "Sports" and "Fraternité", each respectively in one of the four official languages of the organization, namely Spanish, Portuguese, English and French. The original flag also displayed a torch along with the [[Olympic symbols#Olympic rings|Olympic Rings]] and five circles with the official colors of the Olympics on a white background. Finally, the words PASO and ODEPA were written to indicate the organization the flag represents.

==Member countries==
In the following table, the year in which the NOC was recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) is also given if it is different from the year in which the NOC was created.

''Former member:'' [[Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee]]

There are three areas not a part of Panam Sports as they are not independent nations:

* [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] is a self-governing overseas territory of [[France]] and not a country.
* [[French Guiana]] is not a member of Panam Sports as it is an [[Overseas department]] of [[France]] and not a country. It is the only area of South America not involved.
* [[Greenland]] is an autonomous country within [[Denmark]] and politically associated with Europe, therefore it is the only North American country not involved in Panam Sports.

==Exclusion of indigenous sports==
Despite criticisms that [[Ulama (game)|Ulama]] or [[Mesoamerican Ballgame]] and [[Lacrosse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ammsa.com/publications/windspeaker/aboriginal-pavilion-will-tell-%E2%80%9Cour-story%E2%80%9D-our-way|title=Aboriginal pavilion will tell "our story" our way|last=Nahwegahbow|first=Barb|date=2014|publisher=AMMSA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tworowtimes.com/news/regional/six-nations-announces-participation-pan-games/|title=Six Nations announces participation in Pan-Am Games|last=Windle|first=Jim|date=February 4, 2015|publisher=The Two Rows Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not included in the program of the [[Pan American Games]], the number of countries practicing the sport is too small for the sport to be added to the program. Currently, there are 13 national federations in the Americas affiliated with the [[International Lacrosse Federation]], with a minimum number of Panam Sports recognition being 14 (Bermuda, Canada, United States, Iroquois, Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico and Haiti). However, the [[Iroquois]] nation is not recognized by Panam Sports or the IOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filacrosse.com/haiti-voted-in-as-fils-55th-member/|title=Haiti Voted in as FIL's 55th Member|author=|date=|website=filacrosse.com|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there are 12 regional member nations of the FIL, still not enough to include the sport in the Pan Am Games.  Lacrosse is recognized by the Global Association of International Sports Federations and by the [[International Olympic Committee]]. However, this is not the case with ulama, which inhibits its participation in the Pan American Games. It is a possibility that lacrosse will be included in the program of the Games in the future when more countries join their respective international body.

'''Tate Rink''' is a 2,648-seat [[hockey rink]] in [[West Point, New York]]. It is home to the [[United States Military Academy]] [[Army Black Knights|Black Knights]] [[Army Black Knights men's ice hockey|men's ice hockey]] [[team]].  It was built in as part of the Major Donald W. Holleder Center athletic complex, which also includes [[Christl Arena]].  Army's first game in the arena was October 25, 1985, a 5-0 win over [[Ryerson University]] of Toronto. The first goal scored in the rink was by West Point plebe Vincent McDermott of Braintree, MA who also scored the second goal that evening. The arena is named for the Tate brothers, Joseph S. Tate '41 and Frederic H.S. Tate '42, who were both pilots killed in combat in World War II. ([[Don Holleder|Maj. Holleder '56]], the namesake of the complex, was an All-American football and basketball player killed in action in Vietnam in 1967.)
Before the Holleder Center was built, the Black Knights hockey team used the open-air Smith Rink, which was across Mills Road, where the James K. Herbert Alumni Center now stands.

'''''The Big Green''''' is a 1995 family sports comedy film by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] starring [[Olivia d'Abo]] and [[Steve Guttenberg]], written and directed by [[Holly Goldberg Sloan]]. It also stars [[Bug Hall]], [[Chauncey Leopardi]], and [[Patrick Renna]]. The film is about the antics of a soccer team consisting of a misfit group of small town kids who are coached by a teacher from England.

==Plot==
Teacher Anna Montgomery ([[Olivia d'Abo]]), who is on an exchange program from [[Surrey]], England, is placed into a school in the fictional tiny town of Elma, Texas. She struggles to connect with the children at first, as they believe they are underachievers doomed to dead end lives  after receiving the lowest test scores in the state for four years running. She is also shocked to learn that the children think very little of everything. So instead of teaching geography to the inattentive class, Ms. Montgomery breaks the globe in an attempt to introduce the kids to a new game. After some confusion, the children begin to learn the game of [[Association Football|soccer]]. Then at the end of the first session, Ms. Montgomery tells them that they have been entered into a league in [[Austin, Texas]], but their first game was the next day. At this point, the town Sheriff's Deputy Tom Palmer ([[Steve Guttenberg]]) becomes co-coach while at the same time becoming enamored of Montgomery.

The team travels to Austin to play against the Knights, who are the state champions and undefeated for that season. Because none of the kids have learned the rules, they do not know how to play and lose 18–0. They lose heart and do not want to play anymore, until they discover the talent of new classmate Juan Morales (Anthony Esquivel), but have to persuade his mother to let him play. From the beginning, she insists that Juan avoids making bonds with anyone around because of how much it would hurt him if they had to leave soon. The reason they move a lot is because she is trying to keep a low profile to avoid being caught on account of legal citizenship matters. However, after enough begging from the clan, she reluctantly agrees to let Juan join the team. Once Juan joins the team, they go on a remarkable run to the finals, with a record of eight wins, two losses, and one tie, and in the finals they meet the Knights. As the town goes crazy for the final, hometown boy and current Knights coach Jay Huffer ([[Jay O. Sanders]]) returns to Elma, and finds in the bar the drunken father of Kate Douglas ([[Jessica Robertson]]), one of the players, who tells Huffer (who also just so happens to have a job with the IRS) via bribery that Juan and his mother are illegal immigrants, leading to an investigation that the sheriff forces Deputy Palmer to take up that ultimately forces them to flee frantically to avoid deportation. Though we learn that Juan was born native, while it was his mother who wasn't. Kate is left furious with both her father and Deputy Palmer over the situation, but Montgomery is able to convince her to stay on the team and forgive them.

On the day of the final, Deputy Palmer goes looking for Juan to help the team in the final, and by halftime the team is down 2–0. With 10 minutes to play, there is an injury to a Knights player, and in this time Juan returns with Deputy Palmer and his mother, and he is substituted into the game immediately. He sets up Elma's first goal, and with the last kick of the match, scores the equalizer himself. The game then goes into a shootout, and after the first three shots are scored by each team, both teams miss their fourth kick. In the final kick, the Knights captain, top scorer in the league and son of the coach, Jay Huffer Jr., steps onto the field. The Big Green goalie Larry Musgrove ([[Patrick Renna]]), who suffered from visions of the opposition players becoming "monsters," manages to turn himself into a monster in his own fantasy, in order to psych out the opponent and save the kick. The final kick for the championship was to be taken by the Big Green's smallest, and youngest player, Newt Shaw ([[Bug Hall]]). As he runs in to take the kick, he slips but still sails the ball into the bottom left corner, giving the championship to the Big Green. Huffer, having made a bet with Montgomery if his Knights were to lose, kisses the Big Green's goat mascot, much to his disgust.

At the beginning of the movie, there was a billboard for the town's only other sporting success, in [[American football|football]] back in the 1970s, but the end of the movie shows a new billboard, one documenting the success of the Big Green, and also a sticker saying they had the 4th highest test scores in the state.

[[File:Ebnit06061.JPG|thumb|Trail riding in [[Dornbirn]], [[Austria]], It is often a group activity.]]
[[File:MountainBikeTrail.jpg|thumb|Mountain bike trail in the [[Forest of Dean]], [[England]].]]

'''Trail riding''' is riding outdoors on [[trail]]s, [[bridle path]]s, and [[forest road]]s, but not on [[road]]s regularly used by motorised traffic. A trail ride can be of any length, including a long distance, multi-day trip. It originated with [[equestrianism|horse riding]], and in North America, the equestrian form is usually called "trail riding," or, less often "hacking." In the UK and Europe, the practice is usually called horse or pony trekking.

The modern term also encompasses [[mountain biking]], [[Mixed terrain cycle touring|mixed terrain cycle-touring]], and the use of [[motorcycle]]s and other motorized [[all-terrain vehicle]]s. It may be informal activities of an individual or small group, or larger events organized by a club.  Some equestrian trail rides in the USA are directed by professional guides or [[outfitter]]s, particularly at [[guest ranch]]es. In some parts of the world, trail riding (of whatever kind) is limited by law to recognized, and sometimes function-specific, [[trail]]s that are [[waymark]]ed. In other places, trails may be less maintained and more natural. Trail riding can include other activities, such as [[camping]], [[hunting]], [[fishing]], [[orienteering]] and [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]].

==Types and uses of trails==
{{main|Trail}}

Often, horses under saddle are subject to the same regulations as [[pedestrians]] or hikers where those requirements differ from those for cyclists.  In most states, horses are classified as [[livestock]] and thus restricted from areas such as the right of way of the [[interstate highway system]], though generally permitted to travel along the side of other roadways, especially in rural areas.

[[Rail trails]], which are redeveloped disused [[railways]] converted into multi-use trails)) often provide invaluable trail riding areas in many parts of the world.  A [[bridle path]], also called a bridleway, equestrian trail, horse riding path, bridle road, or horse trail, is a [[trail]] or a [[thoroughfare]] that is used by people riding on horses, though such trails often now serve a wider range of users, including [[equestrians]], [[hikers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amc-nh.org/committee/trailcrew/trailwork/index.php?fd=20120808+Old+Bridle+Path/|title=AMC-NH - Trailwork: Old Bridle Path|author=|date=|website=amc-nh.org|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426075652/http://amc-nh.org/committee/trailcrew/trailwork/index.php?fd=20120808+Old+Bridle+Path/ |archivedate=26 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cycling|cyclists]]. Such paths are either impassable for motorized vehicles, or vehicles are banned. The laws relating to allowable uses vary from country to country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url         = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bridle%20path | title         = bridle path | work         = Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary | publisher         = Merriam-Webster | accessdate         = July 24, 2010 | deadurl         = no | archiveurl         = https://web.archive.org/web/20100409210749/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bridle%20path | archivedate         = April 9, 2010 | df         =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The American Heritage Dictionary |edition=Fourth |year=2007 |chapter=Bridle Path}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England and Wales]] a bridle path now refers to a route which can be legally used by horse riders in addition to walkers, and since 1968, by cyclists.  In the US, the term bridle path is used colloquially for trails or paths used primarily for people making day treks on horses, and used primarily on the east coast, whereas out west the equivalent term is simply [[trail]]. The United States has few if any formal designations for bridle paths, though horses are generally allowed on most state and federal trails, roads and public routes except where specifically restricted, although rules differ among locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/9643703-95/state-listens-to-horse-owners-drops-plans-to-limit-trail-access|title=Concord Monitor: "N.H. drops plans to limit horse use of state trails after complaints"|author=|date=|website=concordmonitor.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225911/http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/9643703-95/state-listens-to-horse-owners-drops-plans-to-limit-trail-access|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some criticism of trail riding when excess or improper use of trails may lead to [[erosion]], the spread of [[invasive plant]]s, conflict with [[hiking|hikers]], or harassment of wildlife. Off-road or trail activity is usually not permitted, as such activity may also raise the risk of soil erosion, spread weeds, and cause other damage. However, many responsible [[equestrianism|equestrians]], mountain bikers, and off-road motorcyclists, especially those who get involved in these sports by joining an organized club, perform hours of trail maintenance every year. Many organizations also sponsor educational events to teach newcomers about safety, responsible land stewardship and how to improve riding techniques.

==Equestrian use==
Many [[long-distance trail]]s throughout the world have sections suitable for horse riding, some suitable throughout their length, and some have been developed primarily for horse riding. Within the United States National Trail Classification System,&lt;ref&gt;National Trail Classification System, FSM 2350, and FSH 2309.18, Federal Register: July 3, 2006 (Volume 71, Number 127), Pages 38021-38052 [http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-IMPACT/2006/July/Day-03/i5967.htm online copy on epa.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807143609/http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-IMPACT/2006/July/Day-03/i5967.htm |date=2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; equestrian trails include simple day-use bridle paths and others built to accommodate long strings of [[pack animal]]s on journeys lasting many days. Some trails managed by the [[United States Forest Service|U. S. Forest Service]] and other governmental entities may restrict access of horses, or restrict access during certain times of the year.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.discoverytrail.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801112831/http://discoverytrail.org/ |date=2015-08-01 }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverytrail.org|title=American Discovery Trail Society - the only coast-to-coast, non-motorized recreational trail for hiking, biking, riding|first=The Cyphers Agency, 888-412-7469,|last=http://www.thecyphersagency.com|date=|website=www.discoverytrail.org|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201192728/http://www.discoverytrail.org/|archivedate=1 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Access to trails and pathways on private land is generally left to the discretion of the landowner, subject to the general [[trespass]] laws of each of the 50 states.

===Pleasure riding===
The term [[pleasure riding]] may encompass trail riding. This refers to a form of [[equestrianism]] that encompasses many forms of recreational riding for personal enjoyment, without any element of competition.  Pleasure riding is called "hacking" in [[United Kingdom]], and in parts of the eastern United States and Canada.  In other parts of the United States, particularly the [[American west]], the term trail riding is used interchangeably with pleasure riding when on natural trails or public lands. Many horses are suitable for pleasure riding, including [[grade horse]]s and other animals of ordinary quality and good disposition.  Such horses are sometimes called [[hack (horse)|hacks]], particularly in those areas where pleasure riding is known as hacking.  In recreational trail riding, having fun and enjoying time spent in natures rather than speed and form are the goals.

===Equestrian competition===
There are competitive events that occur on natural trails to test the endurance or trail riding ability of a horse. The level of difficulty varies by distance, trail, and terrain. [[Endurance riding]] encompasses races of varying lengths, usually from {{convert|25|mi}} to {{convert|100|mi}}, where the first horse to cross the finish line and be deemed "fit to continue" by passing a veterinary examination is the winner. [[Competitive trail riding]] is another distance competition that differs from endurance races, as the first horse to cross the line does not necessarily win, but rather the competitors are required to finish within a minimum and a maximum time with their horse in the best condition and with additional scoring for horsemanship and care of the animal.

There are competitive events at [[horse show]]s, called [[Trail (horse show)|trail classes]], which test the horse and rider's ability to handle obstacles resembling those commonly found on trails, such as opening and closing gates, crossing logs, and navigating forward, backwards and to the side.  There are also [[judged trail ride]]s, which occur on a natural trail, but assess trail-class-style points based on the ability of the horse and rider to navigate specific natural and man-made obstacles encountered along the trail.

==Mountain biking==
[[File:MTB downhill.jpg|thumb|[[Downhill mountain biking|Downhilling]] in Russia]]
Mountain bikes are typically ridden on mountain trails, fire roads, logging roads, and other unpaved trails. These types of terrain commonly include rocks, washouts, ruts, loose sand, loose gravel, roots, and steep slopes. Mountain bikes are built to handle this terrain and the obstacles that are found in it, like logs, vertical drop offs, and small boulders. Mountain bikes, therefore, are more sturdily constructed than regular bicycles, have larger knobby tires, more powerful brakes, and the lower gear ratios needed for steep grades with poor traction.

Trail riding on a mountain bike can be: 
* On short, steep, highly technical, constructed trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/aug/22/mountain-biking-trail-centres-uk|title=Where to mountain bike in the UK|first=Chris|last=Moran|date=21 August 2009|website=the Guardian|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064300/http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/aug/22/mountain-biking-trail-centres-uk|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On longer trails, like bridle paths, rail trails, farm and forest roads and [[towpath]]s. The [[South Downs Way]] in England and the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]] Towpath Trail, in the USA would be examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhf.org.uk/get-involved/events/bike-rides/event-information/south-downs-way-off-road-bike.aspx|title=South Downs Way Off-Road Bike Ride|author=|date=|website=www.bhf.org.uk|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026142612/http://www.bhf.org.uk/get-involved/events/bike-rides/event-information/south-downs-way-off-road-bike.aspx|archivedate=26 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohioanderiecanalway.com/Main/Biking.aspx|title=Biking - Ohio &amp; Erie Canalway|author=|date=|website=www.ohioanderiecanalway.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002101125/http://www.ohioanderiecanalway.com/Main/Biking.aspx|archivedate=2 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* On hiking trails that can include steep mountain trails and high passes. These rides can last for days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Alpinebicycle.org|title=The Alpine Bicycle Club &amp; Colorado Rough Riders|author=|date=|website=www.alpinebicycle.org|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911195711/http://alpinebicycle.org/|archivedate=11 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Off-road bicycle trails are generally function-specific and most commonly waymarked along their route. They may take the form of single routes or form part of larger complexes, known as trail centres. Off-road trails often incorporate a mix of challenging terrain, [[singletrack]], smooth fireroads, and even paved paths. Trails with an easy or moderate technical complexity are generally deemed [[cross-country cycling|cross-country]] trails, while trails difficult even to experienced riders are more often dubbed [[Enduro (mountain biking)|all-mountain]], [[freeride]], or [[downhill mountain biking|downhill]]. Downhilling is particularly popular at ski resorts such as [[Mammoth Mountain Ski Area|Mammoth Mountain]] in [[California]], USA or [[Whistler Blackcomb]] in [[British Columbia]], Canada, where [[ski lift]]s are used to get bikes and riders to the top of the mountain.

Long rides on hiking and mountain paths have some resemblance to [[cycle touring]] but the latter usually take place on [[Asphalt concrete|tarmac]]. However, [[Mixed Terrain Cycle-Touring|mixed terrain cycle-touring]], nicknamed "rough riding" in Canada and the USA and "rough stuff" in Europe, is a form of trail riding, because it involves cycling over a variety of surfaces and topography, on a single route, either using a mountain bike or [[hybrid bike]]. A new style of travel called adventure cycle-touring or expedition touring involves exploring remote regions of the world on sturdy bicycles carrying lightweight gear. This type of trail riding is in fact a form of [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Lord, Adventure Cycle-Touring (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Biking on Mount Tamalpais.JPG|thumb|[[Mountain biking on Mount Tamalpais]], [[California]], USA]]
[[Mountain biking on Mount Tamalpais|Mount Tamalpais]], [[California]], USA, and the surrounding areas in [[Marin County, California]] are recognized as the birthplace of [[History of the mountain bike and mountain biking|mountain biking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatetrails.com/mounttam.html|title=Mount Tamalpais|author=|date=|website=gatetrails.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123115313/http://gatetrails.com/mounttam.html|archivedate=23 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, mountain biking pioneers such as [[Gary Fisher]], Otis Guy, [[Charlie Kelly (businessman)|Charlie Kelly]] and [[Joe Breeze]] were active. The 2006 film [[Klunkerz: A Film About Mountain Bikes|''Klunkers'']] chronicled their story, solidifying Mount Tamalpais' legendary status as a trail riding destination.

There has been considerable controversy around trail access for mountain bikes, both in terms of [[Mountain biking#The Environmental Impacts of Mountain Biking|environmental impact]] and the safety of other trail users. As a result, bicycles are generally restricted from narrow, single-track trails, though bicycles are allowed on most fire roads. However, mountain bikers in the United States generally have access to multi-use trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parksconservancy.org/visit/park-sites/dias-ridge.html|title=Dias Ridge|author=|date=|website=www.parksconservancy.org|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712065750/http://www.parksconservancy.org/visit/park-sites/dias-ridge.html|archivedate=12 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Path down from the Ridgeway to Bishopstone, Wiltshire.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bridle path]] down from [[the Ridgeway]] to [[Bishopstone, Salisbury]], [[Wiltshire]], England.]]
In England and Wales, [[bridle path]]s and some other [[Right of way|rights of way]], such as [[byway (road)|byways]] and 'Roads used as paths' (RUPP), are open to cyclists, but [[footpath]]s are not.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ride-uk.org.uk"/&gt;--&gt; However, in [[Scotland]] there is no legal distinction between footpaths and bridleways, and it is generally accepted that cyclists and horseriders may follow rights of way with suitable surfaces.&lt;ref name="Outdoor Access Scotland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outdooraccess-scotland.com|title=Scottish Outdoor Access Code|author=|date=|website=www.outdooraccess-scotland.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316101704/http://outdooraccess-scotland.com/|archivedate=16 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Right of way|Rights of way]] are somewhat limited in [[Northern Ireland]].

The '''Český svaz orientačních sportů (ČSOS)''' is the national [[Orienteering]] Association in [[Czech Republic]]. It is recognized as the [[orienteering]] association for the [[Czech Republic]] by the [[International Orienteering Federation]], of which it is a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?/iof2006/iof/member_federations/iof_member_federations|title= IOF Member Federations|accessdate=2008-06-20 |work=[[International Orienteering Federation]] |date= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080618185711/http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?/iof2006/iof/member_federations/iof_member_federations &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Czechoslovakia was among the ten founding members of the [[International Orienteering Federation]] in 1961, and participated in the first [[European Orienteering Championships]] in 1962.&lt;ref name=o1987&gt;{{cite book |title=Orienteringsidretten i Norge gjennom 90 år |editor=Knut Berglia |editor2=Tom-Erik Brohaug |editor3=Kristoffer Staver |editor4=Kaare Thuesen |editor5=Torgeir Strandhagen |language=Norwegian |year=1987 |publisher=[[Norges Orienteringsforbund]]|pages=159, 278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1972 [[World Orienteering Championships]] were held in [[Doksy]], and the 1991 championships were held in [[Mariánské Lázně]] in then Czechoslovakia (current Czech Republic). The 2008 World Championships were hosted in [[Olomouc]] in the Czech Republic.

In 2012 the Czech Republic won gold medals in the men's relay in the World Championships.
