The 1970s saw the development of some the earliest video games, chiefly in [[Arcade game|arcade]] versions, but also several for the [[personal computer]] and the earliest [[games consoles]].

== Consoles of the 3007 ==

=== First generation consoles ===
{{main article|First generation of video game consoles}}
[[File:Polistil VG2 pong console.jpg|thumb|[[Polistil]] VG2 [[Pong]] clone (1978), made in Italy.]]
The so-called first generation of consoles first went on sale between 1968 and 1977 and included the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], [[Telstar (game console)|Telstar]], [[Pong#Home_version|Home Pong]] and [[Color TV-Game]]

Their typical characteristics were:

* [[Discrete circuit|Discrete]] transistor-based digital game [[Discrete logic|logic]].
* Games were native components of consoles rather than based on external or removable media.
* Entire game playfield occupies only one screen.
* Players and objects consist of very basic lines, dots or blocks.
* Colour graphics are basic (mostly black and white or other dichromatic combination; later games may display three or more colours).
* Either single-channel or no audio.
* Lacked features of [[History of video game consoles (second generation)|second generation consoles]], such as [[microprocessor]] logic, [[ROM cartridge]]s, [[flip-screen]] playfields, [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite-based graphics]], and [[List of video game console palettes|multi-color graphics]].

=== Second generation consoles 1976-1983 ===
[[File:Fairchild-Channel-F.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Fairchild Channel F]], released in 1976, was the first programmable [[ROM cartridge]]–based [[video game console]], and the first console to use a [[microprocessor]].]]
[[File:Milton-Bradley-Microvision-Handheld-FL.jpg|thumb|[[Microvision]] (1979)]]
{{main article|Second generation of video game consoles}}
The second generation, first on sale 1976–88, were more advanced. Consoles first available in the late 1970s included the [[Fairchild Channel F]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Bally Astrocade]] and [[Magnavox Odyssey²]]. The first handheld console, the [[Microvision]], was released in 1979.

Typical tech specs:
* [[Microprocessor]]-based game logic.
* [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI simulation]] of computer-based opponents, allowing for [[Single-player video game|single-player gaming]].
* [[ROM cartridge]]s for storing games, allowing any number of different games to be played on one console.
* Game playfields able to span multiple [[flip-screen]] areas.
* Blocky and simplistic-looking [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], with a [[Display resolution|screen resolution]] of around 160 × 192 [[pixels]].
* Basic [[List of video game console palettes|color graphics]], generally between 2-color (1-bit) and 16-color (4-bit).
* Up to three channel audio.
* Lacked features of third-generation consoles, such as scrolling [[Tile-based video game|tile-based]] playfields.

==History==

===Golden age of arcade games===
{{main article|Golden age of arcade video games}}

Classic arcade games of the 1970s include ''[[Space Invaders]]'' (1978),  ''[[Space Race (video game)|Space Race]]'' (1973), ''[[Tomohiro Nishikado#Speed Race|Speed Race]]'' (1974), ''[[Gun Fight]]'' (1975), ''[[Fonz (video game)|Fonz]]'' (1976), ''[[Night Driver (arcade game)|Night Driver]]'' (1976), ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'' (1976), ''[[Death Race (1976 video game)|Death Race]]'' (1976), ''[[Space Wars]]'' (1977), ''[[Barrier (video game)|Barrier]]'' (1979), ''[[Speed Freak]]'' (1979), ''[[Warrior (arcade game)|Warrior]]'' (1979), ''[[Tail Gunner]]'' (1979), ''[[Galaxian]]'' (1979), ''[[Lunar Lander (1979 video game)|Lunar Lander]]'' (1979) and ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' (1979).

== Notable video-game franchises established in the 1970s ==
&lt;!--This section is devoted to game series that released their FIRST title within the 1970s decade. To qualify, the noted game must have at least one sequel or expansion pack. The dates provided are for the FIRST title's release.--&gt;
&lt;!--In order to qualify as a franchise that accompanies a major film or television franchise, the game must have several games or game sequels associated with it. For example, in the 2000s, Harry Potter would qualify because of the numerous titles devoted to that film series.--&gt;
&lt;!--In order to qualify as a spin-off, the game must feature a character or be within the same universe as another franchise. A sequel is NOT a spin-off--&gt;
&lt;!--A MMO can be included in the list, even if they are of the same or similar franchise of another game. For example, in the 1990s, Warcraft is listed, but in the 2000s, World of Warcraft can be listed as well and labeled a spin-off.--&gt;

The '''Citizen Cup''' was a women's [[tennis]] tournament played on outdoor [[clay court]]s. It was the seventh edition of the [[Betty Barclay Cup|Citizen Cup]] and was an [[WTA Tier II tournaments|Tier II tournament]] on the [[1993 WTA Tour]]. The tournament took place from 26 April to 2 May 1993 at the [[Am Rothenbaum]] venue, in [[Hamburg]], Germany.

==Seles stabbing==
This tournament would later attract infamy for being the location where then [[List of WTA number 1 ranked players|World No. 1]] [[Monica Seles]] was [[Monica_Seles#Stabbing|stabbed]] during a singles quarterfinal match with then World No. 14 [[Magdalena Maleeva]] by an obsessed fan of [[Steffi Graf]], Günter Parche.

The '''American Derby''' is a [[Thoroughbred horse race]] in the [[United States]] run annually at [[Arlington Park]] in [[Arlington Heights, Illinois|Arlington Heights]], [[Illinois]]. The inaugural American Derby was held at Chicago's old Washington Park Race Track on the city's South Side and raced there until 1905, when the facility was closed following the state's ban on gambling and horse racing and the track was demolished. 1893's American Derby was the 2nd richest race in the U.S. during the 19th century.&lt;ref name="EOC390"&gt;Reiss, Steven A., ''Horse Racing'', Eds. Grossman, James R., Keating, Ann Durkin, and Reiff, Janice L., 2004 ''The Encyclopedia of Chicago'', pp. 390-1. The University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|0-226-31015-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no racing in Chicago in 1895, 1896, 1897, 1899, and again in 1905 and 1906. The effect would be that the American Derby was not run from 1905 through 1925, except for 1916 when it was hosted by the [[Hawthorne Race Course]] in [[Stickney, Illinois|Stickney]]/[[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]], [[Illinois]]. Revived in 1926, it evolved to become one of the important events of the American racing season that drew some of the very best horses from all over the country. It was run at the new [[Washington Park Race Track]] in [[Homewood, Illinois]] in 1926 and 1927 and then was held at the Arlington Park course in 1928 before returning to the new Washington Park in 1929 where it remained through 1957. Since 1958, the race has been run at Arlington Park.

Since 1992 the American Derby has been run on [[grass|turf]]. Previously, it had been raced on the turf course from 1955 through 1957 and from 1970 through 1976. Over the years, the distance has varied:

*{{frac|1|1|2}}  miles: 1884-1904, 1926, 1927
*{{frac|1|1|4}} miles: 1928-1951, 1962-1965, 1977-1991
*1 mile: 1952-1954, 1958-1961
*{{frac|1|1|8}} miles: 1966-1974, 1976, 2015 to present
*{{frac|1|1|16}} miles: 1975
*{{frac|1|3|16}} miles (on [[grass|turf]]): 1955-1957, 1992 - 2014

In [[American football]] a '''play''' is a close to the ground "plan of action" or "strategy" used to move the ball down the field.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia and Rangarajan, Nandhini. 2013. [http://store.newforums.com/A-Playbook-for-Research-Methods-SEB005.htm ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management''] Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press, p. 1. and p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; A play begins at either the snap from the center or at kickoff. Most commonly plays occur at the snap during a [[Down (American and Canadian football)|down]]. These plays range from basic to very intricate. Football players keep a record of these '''plays''' in their playbook.

==Order of a play==
{{Main|Play from scrimmage}}
[[File:Coach Whittenburg draws up a play 140923-A-PU919-055.jpg|thumb|Drawing up a play.]]
A play begins in one of two ways:
*A play from scrimmage begins when the ball is delivered from the center to a back, usually the [[quarterback]].
*A free kick
Once the play begins, it will continue until one of the following events happens:
*The ball carrier is down, usually defined as when any body part besides the hands and feet touches the ground.
*The ball carrier's forward progress is stopped to the point where a stalemate occurs and it is clear that the ball cannot be advanced any farther, nor is he easily going down as defined above.
*The ball carrier steps ''out of bounds''.
*A forward pass touches the ground before it is caught (an [[incomplete pass]]). The ball touching the ground in other situations (called a [[fumble]]) does NOT end the play.  In the case of a fumble, the play still continues until one of the above conditions is met.

When the play ends, the ball is set for the next play.  For the first three instances above, the ball is set at the point of its ''maximum forward progress''.  That means that if a runner is driven back in the process of a tackle OR is ruled down by lack of forward progress, the ball is placed as close to his opponent's goal line as he had gotten before being driven back.  If he runs backwards of his own volition, the ball is marked where he goes down.  In the case of an incomplete pass, the ball is placed at the previous [[line of scrimmage]].

Play then resumes as described above.

==Formation requirements==
The offensive team must have seven players on the line of scrimmage at the start of a play.  Those players may be positioned at any place along the line of scrimmage  (which extends all of the way across the playing field).

The defensive team may position as many as 11 players on the line of scrimmage.  Usually, there are from 3 to 8 defensive players on the line of scrimmage.

==Offensive plays==

===Offensive terminology===
*'''run block''' -- An active type of blocking, where the player steps forward in an attempt to push a defensive player out of the path of the ball carrier.
*'''pass block'''-- A passive type of blocking, where the player steps backward to establish a ''pocket'' around the quarterback to give the quarterback a chance to pass.
*'''lead block'''-- A situation where one player precedes the ball carrier along his intended path in order to clear any defensive players that have not already been blocked.
*'''pull''' -- When a member of the offensive line takes a step back from his usual place in a line and moves laterally in order to block somewhere else. Pulling can be done on pass and run plays.
*'''pocket''' -- The protected area around a quarterback established by the offensive line in order to give him adequate time and sight lines in order to complete a pass.
*'''gap''' -- A space between blockers. Defenders can [[shoot the gap]].
*'''hole''' -- A space in the line where a ball carrier aims on a running play.  These can be predesignated holes defined by the spacing between players ''before the snap'', or they can be established by moving players around and establishing the holes ''after the snap'' (in a play called [[Smashmouth offense#Run to Daylight|run-to-daylight]]).
*'''snap''' The act of the center passing the ball from a resting position on the ground to a player behind the line of scrimmage, usually (but not always) the quarterback.
*'''pass''' -- Also called a ''[[forward pass]]''. A ball that leaves a player's hand and moves towards the opponents goal line.
*'''lateral''' -- Also called a ''[[Lateral pass|backward pass]]'', ''pitch'', or ''pitch-out''.  A ball that leaves a player's hand and moves parallel to or away from the opponent's goal line.
*'''handoff''' -- A ball that is handed directly from one player to another without leaving the first player's hands first.

===Running plays===
In a running play, the ball is advanced beyond the line of scrimmage by a player who receives it from behind the line of scrimmage.  The player advancing the ball can be:
*the player (usually the quarterback) who receives the ball from the center,
or
*any further player to receive the ball via handoff or lateral.  Any number of handoffs or laterals can occur on any play at any time.

====Up the middle====
{{Main|Plunge/Dive}}

Also called ''dive'', ''plunge'', ''buck'', ''guts'', ''slam'' or numerous other names. The most basic run play is a run up the middle. In this case, the ball is handed off from the quarterback to a running back. The back then aims for a predetermined hole between his offensive linemen. This hole can be either between center and guard or between guard and tackle. The offensive line will run block, pushing defenders away from the chosen hole. Often, the fullback will lead block through the hole first to clear a path for the half back or running back.

*In a run up the middle, the running back will aim for one of the A or B gaps:
&lt;code&gt;

        W      T  G  C  G  T  E
                ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^            W
&lt;/code&gt;

====Off tackle====
{{Main|Off Tackle}}
[[File:Power o.jpg|thumb|Off Tackle play.]]
The 'bread-and-butter' of a run-oriented offense, this is typically the most common run play.  Rather than aiming for a hole in the line, the running back aims for the spot just ''outside'' the tackle.  This type of play allows for more improvisation by the running back once he is past the line, since there is often more open field in this area than in any run up the middle.


====Toss====
{{main|Toss play}}
In a toss play, the RB "curves out" towards the sideline on either side and the QB pitches ("tosses") the ball to the RB.

====Sweep====
{{Main|Sweep (American football)}}
[[File:FB-toss-sweep.png|thumb|A fullback sweep play]]
In a sweep play, the fullback begins by running towards the sideline before heading forward.  This motion allows for some of the offensive linemen, often one or both guards, to ''pull'' from their normal positions and establish a ''lane'' for the running back to run through.  A lead blocking fullback often leads him through the lane.  This play, known as the [[Packers sweep]], was the central play in [[Vince Lombardi]]'s "run-to-daylight" offense that was so successful for the [[Green Bay Packers]] of the 1960s.

====Trap====
{{main|Trap run}}
In a trap, a guard on the ''back'' side of the play (away from the direction the fullback or running
back is heading) will pull and lead block for the running back (most of the time, the guard will blindside an unblocked down linemen, and kick him out of the play).  Often, the full-back will take the place of the guard, and block the opening allowed by this.

*Trap blocking for a run through the ''3''-hole between the guard and tackle (In some numbering schemes, the left and right sides are reversed, and this would be the ''2''-hole instead).  The running back will follow the guard through the hole.

====Counter====
{{See also|Counter run|Counter trey}}

Also called a ''misdirection''.  In this play, the runner begins by taking a step or two ''away'' from his intended path, then doubling back and heading in the opposite direction.  Often defenders are clueing on the first move of the running back.   The defenders committed to the first step, but the play moves in the opposite direction.

Counter plays are often (but not always) coupled with ''influence'' blocking, where the offensive line blocks the defense towards (rather than away from) the intended direction of the play.  This gambit often causes the defenders to think the play is going in the opposite direction, and they react as such.

====Draw====
{{Main|Draw play}}

Also called a ''delay''.  In a draw play, the offensive line drops into pass blocking positions, and the quarterback takes a drop as though he were going to pass.  He then hands the ball off to his running back (or keeps it himself) and runs forward past the rushing defenders.  The idea is that the defenders will be tricked in advancing on the quarterback as though it were a pass play, and this will vacate the area just beyond the line of scrimmage for the runner to take advantage of.

====Bootleg====
{{Main|Bootleg play}}

The quarterback fakes a handoff to the running back and continues running with the ball opposite from the direction the running back was headed.  The bootleg can have blockers similar to a ''sweep'' (and in such cases is it often called a ''quarterback sweep'') or it can be run ''naked'', that is without any blockers at all.  A naked bootleg relies on the defense buying the fake handoff and moving to tackle the running back rather than the quarterback.

====Quarterback sneak====
{{Main|Quarterback sneak}}

The quarterback takes the snap and immediately dives to one side of the center or the other.  This is often a short yardage play designed when only a yard or so is needed for a first down or a touchdown.  Often the only players on either side of the ball that know the play is coming are the quarterback and the center (hence the ''sneak'' aspect of it), as the play is often decided by the quarterback upon seeing the defense.  The play is often called by a silent signal between quarterback and center (a pinch or a tap in the direction the sneak is headed).

====End-around====
{{Main|End-around}}

The wide receiver takes a handoff directly from the quarterback. The receiver then may proceed to do one of two things: he either runs the ball towards the line of scrimmage in order to gain yardage, or more rarely, he attempts to pass to another eligible pass receiver.

====Reverse====
{{Main|Reverse (American football)}}

This play resembles a sweep, but before the running back crosses the line of scrimmage, he hands the ball off to a wide receiver going in them reverse (opposite) direction of where the running back was going. If the defense was drawn to the side of the field the running back was going towards, the receiver can outrun the defense to the other side of the field and make a big gain.

====Option====
{{main|Option offense}}
An option play is a play in which the quarterback holds the ball and runs to either side of the offensive line, waiting for an opportunity to run upfield and advance the ball.  At the same time, the running back follows, allowing the quarterback the 'option' of pitching the ball just before he is tackled.  This tactic forces defensive players to commit to either preventing the pitch or tackling the quarterback, allowing the offensive team to choose the best result.  The option play requires a very fast and mobile quarterback to execute it, and employs a great deal of risk, because if the pitch is mishandled it is a live ball that can be recovered by the defense.  The option is rarely seen outside of college football, as high school teams lack the skill to execute it properly, and defensive players on professional teams are quick enough to disrupt the play to the point that it doesn't merit the risk involved.  College football teams West Virginia and Air Force often employ this playstyle. A common form of the option executed on the high school, collegiate, and occasionally professional levels is the [[veer]].

===Passing plays===

====Pass routes====
{{main|Route (gridiron football)}}
A route is a path or pattern that a [[wide receiver|receiver]] in [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]] runs to get open for a [[forward pass]].  

=====Go=====
{{main|Fly (route)}}
A ''go'' or ''fly route'' is a deep route used typically when the receiver has a speed advantage over the defensive back.  In the route, the receiver will run as fast as possible in order to get deeper than the defensive back allowing the quarterback to throw the ball in a spot where only the receiver can get to it.  Due to the speed of the current NFL and college games the go will often be preceded by a double move.

=====Post=====
{{main|Post (route)}}
A post is a deep play where wide receivers run straight down the field a short distance (10-15 yards), and then angle in towards the center of the field (toward the goal 'posts', or like a 'flag post') where the ball is caught at high speed. When this play was originally designed, the goal posts were on the "zero" yard line, in the front of the endzone - thus, a cornerback in man coverage would be led into the post.
In a skinny post, the route is shorter and quicker than a deep post, which may cover 30 or 40 yards. This may also be referred to as a "glance in" or a "bang eight."

=====Flag=====
{{main|Corner (route)}}
A ''flag'' or ''corner route'' is a deep play where wide receivers run straight down the field a long distance (102–150 feet), and then angle out towards the end zone and sideline.  It takes its name from the flags that marked the ends of the goal and end lines before the introduction of flexible pylons.

=====Out=====
{{main|Out (route)}}
An out route will usually feature the receiver running 7 to 10 yards downfield and then making a 90 degree turn towards the sideline.

=====In/Drag=====
The In or Drag route is the opposite of the Out route.  As its name suggests, the route will usually feature the receiver running 7 to 10 yards downfield and then making a 90 degree turn towards the center of the field.

=====Slant=====
{{main|Slant (route)}}
A receiver takes two steps or more downfield then cuts diagonally across the field behind the linebackers and in front of the safeties.

=====Hook/Hitch=====
{{main|Hitch (route)}}
An eligible receiver runs a predetermined number of steps or yards upfield before stopping and turning back in slightly to face the Quarterback, in the hopes that the defender cannot react and disrupt the pass before positive yardage is made.

=====Arrow=====
A flat route is named after the area of the field where it takes place.  During a typical play, due to the routes of other receivers, there is an area of the field that is vacated.  This area known as the "[[Flat (football)|flats]]" is typically from the hash marks to the sideline and from the line of scrimmage to 3-5 yards downfield.  The route itself may be executed several ways.  The most common is also known as the arrow.  This consists of a receiver lining up near the offensive tackle and then taking a short angled path directly to this area.  Running backs often will execute a special flat route that involves them running toward the sideline without the ball from the backfield and then turning upfield as a receiver.  This is often referred to as a swing route.

====Option routes====
Particularly in the highest levels of competition (professional and major college), a play may call for the receiver to 'read' the defensive coverage against him, and run a second route if the first option would be ineffectual. As an example, the receiver may be instructed to begin with a slant route, but if the defender has that covered, switch to an out route.  For this to work correctly, the passer must make the same read as the receiver.

====Screen pass====
{{main|screen pass}}
A screen pass is a pass that is normally thrown to a receiver or running back behind the line of scrimmage.  It is thrown behind the line of scrimmage so that the pulling linemen can get their blocks established.  There is another screen called a bubble screen where there are 3 receivers bunched together to one side, and after the snap the ball is almost instantly thrown to the one farthest behind the line of scrimmage.

====Play-action====
{{main|Play-action pass}}
The quarterback takes the snap and drops back to fake a handoff to the running back.  The quarterback then rapidly pulls the ball back from the faked handoff, trying to hide it from the defense.  The running back continues to move upfield as if he has the ball in his hands.  The offensive line starts to run block, but then quickly goes into pass protection.
The receivers appear to block at first, then go into their routes.

On a play-action pass, which is essentially the opposite of the draw play, the quarterback hopes to fake the defenders into thinking the offense is going to run the ball. The effects of this play is to slow down the pass rush of the defense and it forces the defensive backs to make a decision between covering a receiver or coming up to help stop the run.

===Trick/Gadget plays===
{{main|trick play}}
Trick/Gadget plays are plays that are designed to appear to be one type of play while in reality is another.  These plays typically will catch defenses off guard.  Common examples of trick plays are the Half Back Pass or Razzle Dazzle (Where the running back will pretend to run the ball, but instead throws it to a receiver down field), the [[Flea flicker (American football)|Flea flicker]] (The quarterback hands the ball off to the running back who in turns pitches it back to the quarterback who then throws it to a receiver down field), and the Hook and Ladder, also known as the Hook and Lateral (One receiver runs a hook route and upon catching the ball, laterals it to another teammate as he passes him running down the field).  A notable example of a trick play is the touchdown pass to [[Hines Ward]] ([[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]]) in [[Super Bowl XL]]. The Seahawks' Jon Ryan threw a touchdown to Garry Gilliam in the 2015 NFC Championship Game.

==Defensive plays==

===Rush===
{{main|Rush (gridiron football)#Defense}}
A pass rush (or, colloquially, 'pressure,' e.g., "Chicago really brought the pressure on that last play") occurs when the defense reads a pass play and elects to rush some combination of linemen (either 3 or 4 linemen in typical 3-4 or 4-3 schemes), in an effort to affect the pass that the opposing quarterback is attempting to complete.  Perhaps the most obvious and tangible result of a successful pass rush is the [[quarterback sack|sack]], but even when the quarterback is not sacked, "hurries" and "knockdowns" are also important, as they also serve to disrupt in some manner the pass attempt.  A "hurry" occurs when the quarterback is still able to make a throw, but is forced to throw before he would ideally like (e.g., before all of his receivers have completed running their routes).  A "knockdown" occurs when the quarterback is still able to make a throw, but is knocked to the ground immediately upon making his throw because the rushing linemen were so close to him.  Knockdowns and hurries can also serve to force the quarterback into making bad decisions, which could possibly result in interceptions for the defense.

===Stunts===
{{main|Stunt (gridiron football)}}
Stunts are a special means of rushing the quarterback done to confuse the opposing team's offensive line.  Properly executing a stunt requires two or more defensive lineman working together.  One defensive lineman will take an angled path towards an offensive lineman that he is not lined up across from.  This will usually cause the offensive lineman he is lined up across from to follow him while also occupying the offensive lineman he angled towards.  In turn, the defensive lineman who would have been blocked by the offensive lineman that is being angled to will loop behind his teammate and rush through the gap that was created by the offensive lineman who followed the defensive lineman taking the angle.

&lt;/pre&gt;

===Blitz===
{{main|Blitz (American football)}}
A [[blitz (gridiron football)|blitz]] occurs when the defense sends non defensive-line personnel (either linebackers or defensive backs) to rush the quarterback.  A blitz is an expansion upon the effective concept of the aforementioned pass rush.

===Coverages===
{{main|American football coverage shells}}
In attempting to halt the advancing of the football by the offensive team, the defensive team has many options.  There are various formations that are commonly employed to defend against a passing attack.

====Man-to-man====
Man-to-man coverage is when every receiver is covered by a defensive back or linebacker.  It is a coverage often used while blitzing because there are not enough players available to effectively execute zone coverage.  Man-to-man coverage may be used while not blitzing by teams who have superior defensive backs or against teams with inferior receivers.
:A "shut-down back" is a superior defensive back who does not need the assistance of another team-mate to cover a receiver. Football coaches value him because they may assign other tasks  (for example, blitzing) to his team-mates.

====Zone====
{{main|Zone defense in American football}}
Zone defense is when defensive players (typically defensive backs and linebackers) are responsible for a specific area on the field during pass coverage. Zones are usually more effective against long passes.  When playing in a zone defense, a defensive player is able to observe what the quarterback is attempting to do, anticipate where a pass may be thrown, and perhaps intercept the pass.  Zone defenses tend to produce interceptions of passes or outstanding collisions with receivers after they have made pass receptions.

}}{{DISPLAYTITLE: Bon Secours Wellness Arena}}

'''Bon Secours Wellness Arena''' (formerly the '''BI-LO Center''') is a [[multi-purpose arena]] in [[Greenville, South Carolina]] offering a wide variety of sports and entertainment events. Endearingly known as "The Well," Bon Secours Wellness Arena ("BSWA") is located in downtown [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]], [[South Carolina]], [[United States]] and hosts on average over 120 major events per year. In any given year, over 500,000 live entertainment enthusiasts attend family shows, concerts, and sporting events.

==History==
The Bon Secours Wellness Arena was built in 1998 at a cost of [[United States dollar|US $]]63 million, under its former name of BI-LO Center, to replace Greenville's outdated and under-repaired [[Greenville Memorial Auditorium]], which was imploded on September 20, 1997 on a site located across the street from the new arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Greenville Memorial Auditorium Is History|author=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CS&amp;s_site=thestate&amp;p_multi=CS&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB586B4639B5E49&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|newspaper=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]|location=Greenville, SC|date=September 21, 1997|accessdate=April 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena naming rights were purchased by Dutch grocer [[Ahold]], then-owner of [[BI-LO (United States)|BI-LO]], which had been founded in nearby [[Mauldin, South Carolina|Mauldin]] and was still based there at the time. When it was built, it passed [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]'s [[Carolina Coliseum]] as the largest arena in the state of South Carolina, a distinction it held until 2002, when the [[Colonial Life Arena|Colonial Center]] was built in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia.]]

=== Renovations/renaming ===
On September 18, 2013, the BI-LO Center was officially renamed the Bon Secours Wellness Arena after the [[Bon Secours Health System (USA)|Bon Secours Health System]] purchased the naming rights.

=== Seating capacity ===
As a concert venue, the Bon Secours Wellness Arena can seat approximately 19,000 spectators, depending on the positioning of the stage. In addition, the arena features 30 luxury suites and 840 club seats.

== Notable events ==
Currently, the Bon Secours Wellness Arena regularly hosts a wide variety of events such as [[professional wrestling]], [[monster truck]] rallies, [[ice dancing]] shows and competitions, and concerts spanning many different musical genres.

=== Concerts ===
During an average year, The Well hosts 20-25 concerts spanning across all music genres and related artists. Notable concerts include [[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Luke Bryan]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Eric Church]], [[Bon Jovi]], and many more.

The Bi-Lo Center opened with Janet Jackson in 1998 and followed in the same year with [[Pearl Jam]], and later, [[Rob Zombie]] with [[Korn]]; [[Jay-Z]] in 1999; [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Creed (band)|Creed]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] with [[Foo Fighters]], [[Ricky Martin]], [[N'SYNC]], [[Limp Bizkit]] with [[Godsmack]], [[Eminem]] with [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] in 2000; [[Fuel (band)|Fuel]] with [[Buckcherry]], [[Dave Matthews Band]] in 2001; and [[Puddle of Mudd]], and [[Tool (band)|Tool]] in 2002.

=== Family events ===
The arena also hosts a number of family events such as [[Disney on Ice]], [[Monster Jam]], [[WWE Raw]], and [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. These perennial favorites form the foundation of strong annual programming.

=== Sporting events ===
The arena has served as the home of multiple professional and semi-professional teams. From 2001-2003, the arena served as the home for the [[Greenville Groove]], one of the original members of the [[National Basketball Development League]]. It also hosted the [[Carolina Rhinos]] football team, one of the inaugural members of [[AF2]], from 2000-2002. Beginning in 1998, the arena hosted the [[Greenville Grrrowl]], an [[ECHL]] team. Despite having won the [[Kelly Cup]] in 2002, the [[Greenville Grrrowl]] folded in 2006. On February 14, 2010 the [[ECHL]] team the [[Johnstown Chiefs]] announced that it would be moving from [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown, PA]] to [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville, SC]] following the 2010 season. The [[Johnstown Chiefs]] became first the Greenville Road Warriors and then in 2015 were renamed the [[Greenville Swamp Rabbits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstownchiefs.com/news/index.html?article_id=628|title=Chiefs Seeking Relocation for 2010-11|date=February 14, 2010|publisher=Johnstown Chiefs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127124348/http://johnstownchiefs.com/news/index.html?article_id=628|archivedate=January 27, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Impact Wrestling]] pay-per-view, [[Against All Odds 2008]] was also held at the Arena on February 10th 2008.

==== Basketball ====
The Bon Secours Wellness Arena hosted the [[Southern Conference]] Men's Basketball Tournament in 2000 and 2001, as well as first and second-round games during the 2002 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Men's Basketball Tournament. In September 2016, the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. In September 2016, the NCAA announced that it would move all tournament games scheduled to take place in [[North Carolina]] during the 2016-2017 academic year, due to North Carolina's controversial [[Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act|House Bill 2]]. Therefore, on March 17 and 19, 2017, the Bon Secours Wellness Arena hosted the first and second-round games for the 2017 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, originally intended to take place at the [[Greensboro Coliseum Complex]] in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. This was the first NCAA postseason basketball event to have been held at the arena since 2002.&lt;ref name="NCAA-relocation-announcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/ncaa-announces-sites-relocated-championships|title=NCAA Announces Sites for Relocated Championships|website=NCAA|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] Women's Basketball Tournament was played at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena following a scheduling conflict with the intended host site, [[Philips Arena]].

'''Bowls''' or '''lawn bowls''' is a [[sport]] in which the objective is to roll biased balls so that they stop close to a smaller ball called a  "jack" or "kitty". It is played on a [[bowling green]] which may be flat (for "flat-green bowls") or convex or uneven (for "[[crown green bowls]]"). It is normally played outdoors (although there are many indoor venues) and the outdoor surface is either natural grass, [[artificial turf]], or [[cotula]] (in New Zealand).

==History==
[[File:Bowls match.JPG|thumb|Bowls match in progress at [[Wookey Hole]], United Kingdom]]
It has been traced certainly to the 13th century, and conjecturally to the 12th. [[William Fitzstephen]] (d. about 1190), in his biography of [[Thomas Becket]], gives a graphic sketch of the [[London]] of his day and, writing of the summer amusements of the young men, says that on holidays they were "exercised in Leaping, Shooting, Wrestling, Casting of Stones [in jactu lapidum], and Throwing of Javelins fitted with Loops for the Purpose, which they strive to fling before the Mark; they also use Bucklers, like fighting Men."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/introduction/intro01.html|title=Florilegium urbanum - Introduction - FitzStephen's Description of London|website=users.trytel.com|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly supposed that by jactus lapidum, Fitzstephen meant the game of bowls, but though it is possible that round stones may sometimes have been employed in an early variety of the game - and there is a record of iron bowls being used, though at a much later date, on festive occasions at Nairn, - nevertheless the inference seems unwarranted. The jactus lapidum of which he speaks may have been more akin to [[shot put]]. It is beyond dispute, however, that the game, at any rate in a rudimentary form, was played in the 13th century. A manuscript of that period in the royal library, [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] (No. 20, E iv.), contains a drawing representing two players aiming at a small cone instead of an earthenware ball or jack. The world's oldest surviving bowling green is the [[Southampton Old Bowling Green]], which was first used in 1299.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A311482|title=Southampton Old Bowling Green, Southampton, England|accessdate=6 January 2009 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another manuscript of the same century has a crude but spirited picture which brings us into close touch with the existing game.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Three figures are introduced and a jack. The first player's bowl has come to rest just in front of the jack; the second has delivered his bowl and is following after it with one of those eccentric contortions still not unusual on modern greens, the first player meanwhile making a repressive gesture with his hand, as if to urge the bowl to stop short of his own; the third player is depicted as in the act of delivering his bowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greydragon.org/library/playingbowls.html|title=Playing at Bowls|website=www.greydragon.org|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 14th-century manuscript, Book of Prayers, in the [[Francis Douce]] collection in the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]] contains a drawing in which two persons are shown, but they bowl to no mark. Strutt (Sports and Pastimes) suggests that the first player's bowl may have been regarded by the second player as a species of jack; but in that case it is not clear what was the first player's target. In these three earliest illustrations of the pastime it is worth noting that each player has one bowl only, and that the attitude in delivering it was as various five or six hundred years ago as it is today. In the third he stands almost upright; in the first he kneels; in the second he stoops, halfway between the upright and the kneeling position.

The game eventually came under the ban of king and parliament, both fearing it might jeopardise the practice of archery, then so important in battle. Statutes forbidding it and other sports were enacted in the reigns of [[Edward III]], [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and other monarchs. Even when, on the invention of gunpowder and firearms, the bow had fallen into disuse as a weapon of war, the prohibition was continued. The discredit attaching to bowling alleys, first established in London in 1455, probably encouraged subsequent repressive legislation, for many of the alleys were connected with taverns frequented by the dissolute and gamesters. The word "bowls" occurs for the first time in the statute of 1511 in which [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] confirmed previous enactments against unlawful games. By a further act of 1541—which was not repealed until 1845—artificers, labourers, apprentices, servants and the like were forbidden to play bowls at any time except [[Christmas]], and then only in their master's house and presence. It was further enjoined that any one playing bowls outside his own garden or orchard was liable to a penalty of 6s. 8d.(6 shillings and 8 pence), while those possessed of lands of the yearly value of £100 might obtain licences to play on their own private greens.

In 1864 William Wallace Mitchell (1803–1884), a Glasgow Cotton Merchant, published his "Manual of Bowls Playing" following his work as the secretary formed in 1849 by Scottish bowling clubs which became the basis of the rules of the modern game.
Young Mitchell was only 11 when he played on Kilmarnock Bowling green, the oldest club in Scotland, instituted in 1740.

[[File:Lawn bowls, Central Park.jpg|thumb|right|Bowling greens in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]]]]
The patenting of the first [[lawn mower#History|lawn mower]] in 1830, in Britain, is strongly believed to have been the catalyst, worldwide, for the preparation of modern-style greens, sporting ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc. This is turn led to the codification of modern rules for many sports, including lawn bowls, most football codes, lawn tennis and others.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National ''Ockham's Razor'', first broadcast 6 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

National Bowling Associations were established in the late 1800s. In the then Victorian Colony (now State of Victoria in Australia), the (Royal) [[Victorian Bowling Association]] was formed in 1880 and The Scottish Bowling Association was established in 1892, although there had been a failed attempt in 1848 by 200 Scottish clubs.

Today the sport is played in over 40 countries with more than 50 member national authorities.
The home of the modern game is still Scotland with the World Bowls centre in Edinburgh at Caledonia House,1 Redheughs Rigg, South Gyle, Edinburgh, EH12 9DQ.

==Game==

[[File:Drumoak and district bowling green.jpg|thumb|right|[[Drumoak]] bowling green]]
Lawn bowls is usually played on a large, rectangular, precisely levelled and manicured [[Lawn|grass]] or synthetic surface known as a [[bowling green]] which is divided into parallel playing strips called [[bowling green|rink]]s. In the simplest competition, singles, one of the two opponents flips a coin to see who wins the "mat" and begins a segment of the competition (in bowling parlance, an "end"), by placing the mat and rolling the jack to the other end of the green to serve as a target. Once it has come to rest, the jack is aligned to the centre of the rink and the players take turns to roll their bowls from the mat towards the jack and thereby build up the "head".

A bowl may curve outside the rink boundary on its path, but must come to rest within the rink boundary to remain in play. Bowls falling into the ditch are dead and removed from play, except in the event when one has "touched" the jack on its way. "Touchers" are marked with chalk and remain alive in play even though they are in the ditch. Similarly if the jack is knocked into the ditch it is still alive unless it is out of bounds to the side resulting in a "dead" end which is replayed, though according to international rules the jack is "respotted" to the centre of the rink and the end is continued. After each competitor has delivered all of their bowls (four each in singles and pairs, three each in triples, and two bowls each in fours), the distance of the closest bowls to the jack is determined (the jack may have been displaced) and points, called "shots", are awarded for each bowl which a competitor has closer than the opponent's nearest to the jack. For instance, if a competitor has bowled two bowls closer to the jack than their opponent's nearest, they are awarded two shots. The exercise is then repeated for the next end, a game of bowls typically being of twenty-one ends.

Lawn bowls is played on grass and variations from green to green are common. Greens come in all shapes and sizes, fast, slow, big crown, small crown and so on.

Bowls is generally played in a very good spirit, even at the highest professional level, acknowledgment of opponents' successes and near misses being quite normal.

==Scoring==
Scoring systems vary from competition to competition. Games can be decided when:
* a player in a singles game reaches a specified target number of shots (usually 21 or 25).
* a team (pair, triple or four) has the higher score after a specified number of ends.

Games to a specified number of ends may also be drawn. The draw may stand, or the opponents may be required to play an '''extra end''' to decide the winner. These provisions are always published beforehand in the event's '''Conditions of Play'''.

In the Laws of the Sport of Bowls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbowlsltd.co.uk/laws/index.html |title=Laws of the Sport of Bowls (2011, Crystal Mark Second Edition), World Bowls |accessdate=1 April 2011 |publisher=World Bowls |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409002720/http://www.worldbowlsltd.co.uk/laws/index.html |archivedate=9 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the winner in a singles game is the first player to score 21 shots. In all other disciplines (pairs, triples, fours) the winner is the team who has scored the most shots after 21/25 ends of play. Often local tournaments will play shorter games (often 10 or 12 ends). Some competitions use a "set" scoring system, with the first to seven points awarded a set in a best-or-three or best-of-five set match. As well as singles competition, there can be two (pairs), three (triples) and four-player (fours) teams. In these, teams bowl alternately, with each player within a team bowling all their bowls, then handing over to the next player. The team captain or "skip" always plays last and is instrumental in directing his team's shots and tactics. The current method of scoring in the professional tour ([[World Bowls Tour]]) is sets. Each set consists of nine ends and the player with the most shots at the end of a set wins the set. If the score is tied the set is halved. If a player wins two sets, or gets a win and a tie, that player wins the game. If each player wins a set, or both sets end tied, there is a 3-end tiebreaker to determine a winner.

==Bias of bowls==
[[Image:Bowls&amp;Kitty.JPG|thumb|Two bowls with club stickers. The jack/kitty is sitting in front of the bowls.]]
Bowls are designed to travel a curved path because of a weight [[bias]] which was originally produced by inserting weights in one side of the bowl. This is no longer permitted by the rules and bias is now produced entirely by the shape of the bowl. A bowler determines the bias direction of the bowl in his hand by a dimple or symbol on one side. Regulations determine the minimum bias allowed, and the range of diameters (11.6 to 13.1&amp;nbsp;cm), but within these rules bowlers can and do choose bowls to suit their own preference. They were originally made from [[lignum vitae]], a dense wood giving rise to the term "woods" for bowls, but are now more typically made of a hard plastic composite material.

Bowls were once only available coloured black or brown but they are now available in a variety of colours. They have unique symbol markings engraved on them for identification. Since many bowls look the same, coloured, adhesive stickers or labels are also used to mark the bowls of each team in bowls matches. Some local associations agree on specific colours for stickers for each of the clubs in their area. Provincial or [[national colours]] are often assigned in national and international competitions. These stickers are used by [[officials]] to distinguish teams.

Bowls have symbols unique to the set of four for identification. The side of the bowl with a larger symbol within a circle indicates the side away from the bias. That side with a smaller symbol within a smaller circle is the bias side toward which the bowl will turn. It is not uncommon for players to deliver a "wrong bias" shot from time to time and see their carefully aimed bowl crossing neighbouring rinks rather than heading towards their jack.

When bowling there are several types of delivery. "Draw" shots are those where the bowl is rolled to a specific location without causing too much disturbance of bowls already in the head. For a right-handed bowler, "forehand draw" or "finger peg" is initially aimed to the right of the jack, and curves in to the left. The same bowler can deliver a "backhand draw" or "thumb peg" by turning the bowl over in his hand and curving it the opposite way, from left to right. In both cases, the bowl is rolled as close to the jack as possible, unless tactics demand otherwise. A "drive" or "fire" or "strike" involves bowling with force with the aim of knocking either the jack or a specific bowl out of play - and with the drive's speed, there is virtually no noticeable (or, at least, much less) curve on the shot. An "upshot" or "yard on" shot involves delivering the bowl with an extra degree of weight (often referred to as "controlled" weight or "rambler"), enough to displace the jack or disturb other bowls in the head without killing the end. A "block" shot is one that is intentionally placed short to defend from a drive or to stop an oppositions draw shot. The challenge in all these shots is to be able to adjust line and length accordingly, the faster the delivery, the narrower the line or "green".

==Variations of play==
Particularly in team competition there can be a large number of bowls on the green towards the conclusion of the end, and this gives rise to complex tactics. Teams "holding shot" with the closest bowl will often make their subsequent shots not with the goal of placing the bowl near the jack, but in positions to make it difficult for opponents to get their bowls into the head, or to places where the jack might be deflected to if the opponent attempts to disturb the head.

[[Image:Edgworth Bowling Green.jpg|thumb|left|A crown green at [[Edgworth, Lancashire]]]]

There are many different ways to set up the game. [[Crown green bowls|Crown Green Bowling]] utilises the entire green. A player can send the jack anywhere on the green in this game and the green itself is more akin to a golf green, with lots of undulation. It is only played with two woods each, ahd the jack also has a bias and is only slightly smaller than the woods. At the amateur level it is usual for several ends to be played simultaneously on one green. If two moving woods meet, both are taken back and the shots replayed. If a moving wood strikes a stationary wood or jack from another end, it is again taken back and replayed, but the bowl struck is replaced where contact took place. The game is played usually to 21-up in Singles and Doubles format with some competitions playing to 31-up. The Panel (Professional Crown Green Bowls) is played at the Red Lion, [[Westhoughton]] daily and is played to 41-up with greenside betting throughout play.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Singles, triples and fours and Australian pairs are some ways the game can be played. In singles, two people play against each other and the first to reach 21, 25 or 31 shots (as decided by the controlling body) is the winner. In one variation of singles play, each player uses two bowls only and the game is played over 21 ends.  A player concedes the game before the 21st end if the score difference is such that it is impossible to draw equal or win within the 21 ends. If the score is equal after 21 ends, an extra end is played to decide the winner. An additional scoring method is set play. This comprises two sets over nine ends. Should a player win a set each, they then play a further 3 ends that will decide the winner.

Pairs allows both people on a team to play Skip and Lead. The lead throws two bowls, the skip delivers two, then the lead delivers his remaining two, the skip then delivers his remaining two bowls. Each end, the leads and skips switch positions. This is played over 21 ends or sets play. Triples is with three players while Fours is with four players in each team and is played over 21 ends.

Another pairs variation is 242 pairs (also known as Australian Pairs). In the first end of the game the A players lead off with 2 bowls each, then the B players play 4 bowls each, before the A players complete the end with their final 2 bowls. The A players act as lead and skip in the same end. In the second end the roles are reversed with the A players being in the middle. This alternating pattern continues through the game which is typically over 15 ends.

[[Short Mat Bowls]] is an all-year sport unaffected by weather conditions and it does not require a permanent location as the rink mats can be rolled up and stowed away. This makes it particularly appropriate for small communities as it can be played in village halls, schools, sports and social clubs, hotels and so on. where space is restricted and is also required for other purposes: it is even played on North Sea oil rigs where space is really at a premium.

Bowls are played by the blind and paraplegic. Blind bowlers are extremely skilful. A string is run out down the centre of the lane &amp; wherever the jack lands it is moved across to the string and the length is called out by a sighted marker, when the woods are sent the distance from the jack is called out, in yards, feet and inches-the position in relation to the jack is given using the clock, 12.00 is behind the jack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rbbg.co.uk/blind-bowling-explained/4534550448|title=Blind Bowling Explained - RBBG|website=www.rbbg.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tra bowls ===

[[File:Trabol.JPG|thumb|A bowls tra with bowls and spectator seats next to it.]]

In the province of [[West-Flanders]] (and surrounding regions), tra bowls is the most popular variation of bowls. As opposed to playing it on a flat or uneven terrain, the terrain is made smooth but hollow (tra just means "hollow road" in Flemish). The hollow road causes the path to be curving even more.

The balls are biased in the same way as the lawn bowls balls but with a diameter of about 20&amp;nbsp;cm, a thickness of 12&amp;nbsp;cm and a weight of about 2&amp;nbsp;kg, they are a bit bigger than usual bowls. The target is an unmovable feather or metal plate on the ground, instead of a small ball. The length of the tra is about 18 m.

The scoring is also different, as a point is awarded for every shot that brings the ball closer to the target than any opponent's ball. This causes pure blocking strategies to be less effective.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vlas.be/vlaspdf/infofolders/trabol.pdf Tra bowls information brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the West-Flemish tra bowls federation was founded to uniform the local differing rules and to organise a match calendar.  Meanwhile, they also organise championships and tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westvlaamsetrabolders.be Website of the West-Flemish tra bowls federation&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CAPS United F.C.''' is a popular [[Zimbabwe]]an [[association football|football]] club based in [[Harare]]. Formed in 1973, the team rose to prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s.Used to be nicknamed Manchester Road Boys because of their former address.Its nickname is "Makepekepe" or The Green Machine.

==History==
Popularly known as the '''Cup Kings''' or '''Makepekepe''' for their dominance in most cup tournaments. It is Harare's second most popular team after their rivals [[Dynamos F.C.]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;whom they call their fans Madzvinyu(lizards). But the team have few trophies than Dynamos.Caps United is a team that has produced some of the country's best players and legends including Shaky Tauro, Brenna Msiska, only to name a few.

Steven Kwashi won the 1996 championship. Charles Mhlauri took over in 2004 and won back to back championships. In 2004 they won the league in style losing only one game the whole season, a 3-4 home defeat to Highlanders in a thrilling game at the National Sports Stadium.

On 30 August 2010; Lloyd Chitembwe's 20-month stint as CAPS United's head coach ended when he left the Green Machine after his contract was terminated by mutual consent, following a poor run of results that has torched a rebellion among the club's fans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.chronicle.co.zw/inside.aspx?sectid=11646&amp;cat=5&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2012 [[Sean Connor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nehandaradio.com/2012/01/12/caps-united-set-to-unveil-irishman-as-new-coach/|title=CAPS United to unveil Irishman as new coach – Nehanda Radio|date=12 January 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed manager, the [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irishman]] had previously managed [[Sligo Rovers F.C.|Sligo Rovers]], [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] and [[Galway United F.C.|Galway United]] in the [[League of Ireland]], leading Galway United on the worst season in their history with a record run of defeats&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galwaynews.ie/22624-relegation-brings-end-disastrous-season-united|title=Relegation brings end to disastrous season for United - Galway City Tribune - galwaynews.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relegation to the [[League of Ireland First Division]] (though the club withdrew from the league before they could take their place).

The club has a strong rivalry with Dynamos, their games, Harare derby, attract huge crowds . They do have another rivalry with Bulawayo side Highlanders, the matches between these two giants have been dubbed the Battle of the Cities. These matches in the  past have been associated with violence. In 2004 season their match at Barbourfields stadium vs Highlanders was abandoned due to crowd trouble in the 88th minute after Caps United came from 3-1 down to level 3-3.

Champion was born on June 1, 1978 and raised in [[Pasadena, California]].&lt;ref name="Vibe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/next-espns-cari-champion |accessdate=June 12, 2013 |title=Next: ESPN's Cari Champion |work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |date=December 27, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HKFqxKXS?url=http://www.vibe.com/article/next-espns-cari-champion |archivedate=June 12, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Champion attended the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), where she majored in [[English studies|English]] and minored in [[mass communications]]. She wrote for the ''[[Daily Bruin]]'' and was inspired to pursue a career in [[journalism]] by UCLA alumni, including Matea Gold of the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', who was the editor in chief of the student newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/CariChampion/status/464149972191948800|title=Cari Champion on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feinberg"/&gt; Champion was drawn to journalism with goals of transforming negative stereotypes of [[African American]]s: "I wanted to give people a voice that didn't have a voice. I'm always fighting for the underdog. I don't know where I got it from, but I've been like that all my life. That's why I love journalism."&lt;ref name="DeFrancesco"&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeFrancesco |first=Tracey |date=August 2011 |volume=4 |issue=5 |url=http://tennisviewmag.com/pastissuearticle/cari-champion-the-purpose-driven-reporter/ |accessdate=June 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803131221/http://tennisviewmag.com/pastissuearticle/cari-champion-the-purpose-driven-reporter/ |archivedate=August 3, 2011 |journal=Tennis View Magazine |title=Cari Champion: The Purpose Driven Reporter |location=Seminole |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her junior year, she studied in [[Washington, D.C.]] and earned an internship at [[CNN]].&lt;ref name="Feinberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.ucla.edu/exclusives/espns-referee/ |accessdate=June 12, 2013 |title=ESPN's Referee - Web Exclusive |work=UCLA Magazine Online |publisher=UCLA Marketing &amp; Communications and UCLA Alumni Association |last=Feinberg |first=Paul |date=February 4, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HKGrj8t1?url=http://magazine.ucla.edu/exclusives/espns-referee/ |archivedate=June 12, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Champion graduated from UCLA in 1998,&lt;ref name="Feinberg"/&gt; with an English degree.&lt;ref name="DeFrancesco"/&gt;

== Career ==
=== Early broadcasting work ===
Champion began her broadcasting career at several television stations.&lt;ref name="DeFrancesco"/&gt; She moved to West Virginia for her first reporting job.&lt;ref name="Nesheim"/&gt; She later said of working there: "I was a one-man-band carrying a camera and a tripod and that was God-awful. But I loved it because I wanted to do it. I always wanted to be a reporter."&lt;ref name="DeFrancesco"/&gt; She was a reporter at the [[Orange County Newschannel]] in [[Santa Ana, California]] before joining [[WPTV-TV]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] in the same capacity in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=53|volume=132|journal=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|title=none|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, while working as an anchor for [[WGCL-TV]] in Atlanta, Champion was fired for allegedly uttering a profanity over the air. She appealed the firing and said in an interview for the [[Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education|Maynard Institute]] that the [[floor director]] had not cued her and her co-anchor following a commercial break, and that the microphone picked up a conversation they were having about an unhandy mechanical screenwriter: "I called the screenwriter a 'mothersucka' not the [[f-bomb]]."&lt;ref name="Ho"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ho |first=Rodney |date=December 19, 2007 |url=http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/accessatlanta/radiotalk/entries/2007/12/19/1219_cari_champ.html |accessdate=June 12, 2013 |title=Cari Champion gets a 2nd chance |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HKLBkw1y?url=http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/accessatlanta/radiotalk/entries/2007/12/19/1219_cari_champ.html |archivedate=June 12, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was rehired in January 2008, but left shortly after in March for a broadcasting job outside of Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&amp;p_theme=at&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=126ED8A8A27A1490&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=June 13, 2013|last=Eldridge|first=Richard L.|date=March 20, 2008|title=Changing Channels|newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to Florida, Champion covered news such as [[human interest stories]] and devastating hurricanes in the state.&lt;ref name="Nesheim"/&gt; While working as a reporter there, she developed an affinity for tennis after covering players such as [[Venus Williams|Venus]] and [[Serena Williams]]: "They made me love the sport even more. They opened the door to tennis for so many different people."&lt;ref name="DeFrancesco"/&gt; She subsequently auditioned for the [[Tennis Channel]]'s burgeoning news department and was one of three women selected from a pool of more than fifty candidates.&lt;ref name="DeFrancesco"/&gt; She joined the network in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwww.tennischannel.com/programs/talent/cari_champion.aspx |title=Cari Champion |publisher=[[Tennis Channel]] |accessdate=June 13, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HLgR8c40?url=http://jwww.tennischannel.com/programs/talent/cari_champion.aspx |archivedate=June 13, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Champion worked as a courtside reporter,&lt;ref name="Nesheim"/&gt; and anchored the channel's ''Court Report'' news segment.&lt;ref name="DeFrancesco"/&gt; She also worked as an entertainment reporter for the [[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]] network and shows such as ''[[omg! Insider|The Insider]]'' and ''[[Hollywood 411]]''.&lt;ref name="Feinberg"/&gt;

=== Career at ESPN ===
On October 1, 2012, Champion joined [[ESPN]] as the new host of [[ESPN2]]'s live debate show ''[[First Take (TV series)|First Take]]''.&lt;ref name="Nesheim"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nesheim |first=Jay Jay |date=September 26, 2012 |url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2012/09/cari-champion-joins-espn-as-host-of-first-take-as-show-ratings-surge/ |title=Cari Champion Joins ESPN as Host of First Take as Show Ratings Surge |publisher=[[ESPN|ESPN MediaZone]] |accessdate=June 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HKMAWj6A?url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2012/09/cari-champion-joins-espn-as-host-of-first-take-as-show-ratings-surge/ |archivedate=June 12, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was hired over [[Heidi Watney]] and [[Jemele Hill]] for the job.&lt;ref name="Zaldivar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1329685-espn-reportedly-welcomes-tennis-channels-cari-champion-to-host-first-take |accessdate=June 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HKLjtvNX?url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1329685-espn-reportedly-welcomes-tennis-channels-cari-champion-to-host-first-take |archivedate=June 12, 2013 |deadurl=no |last=Zaldivar |first=Gabe |date=September 10, 2012 |title=ESPN Reportedly Welcomes Tennis Channel's Cari Champion to Host "First Take" |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the show's host, she [[discussion moderator|moderated]] debates between sports pundits [[Skip Bayless]] and [[Stephen A.

Lange tweeted an apology to Champion the following day and ESPN issued a statement to ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that rebuked Lange's tweets, while Champion did not respond publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=D'Zurilla |first=Christie |date=November 5, 2014 |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-artie-lange-cari-champion-racist-sex-fantasy-twitter-espn-20141105-story.html |title=Artie Lange explains his racist sex fantasy about ESPN's Cari Champion |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=November 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Tt5BVC4N?url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-artie-lange-cari-champion-racist-sex-fantasy-twitter-espn-20141105-story.html |archivedate=November 6, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After petitioning ESPN for six months to become an anchor on ''[[SportsCenter]]'', Champion was promoted to the position in June 2015. She hosted her last episode of ''First Take'' on June 19 and began anchoring morning editions of ''SportsCenter'' in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bonesteel |first=Matt |issue=June 19 |year=2015 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2015/06/19/cari-champion-escapes-espns-first-take-for-sportscenter/ |title=Cari Champion escapes ESPN’s ‘First Take’ for ‘SportsCenter’ |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=June 19, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZPWR2R8k?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2015/06/19/cari-champion-escapes-espns-first-take-for-sportscenter/ |archivedate=June 19, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2018, Champion became the host of ESPN's [[SportsNation (TV series)|SportsNation]] along with co-hosts [[LZ Granderson]] and [[Marcellus Wiley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Olivia|date=February 20, 2018|url=https://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2018/02/cari-champion-make-sportsnation-debut-march-12/|title=Cari Champion to Make SportsNation Debut on March 12|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Champion grew up as an avid basketball fan. She is a fan of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[UCLA Bruins]].&lt;ref name="DeFrancesco"/&gt; According to her, she is 6 feet 1 inch tall "with heels".&lt;ref name="Vibe"/&gt; Before working on the show, Champion was an avid watcher of ''First Take'': "I love the barbershop debates that make ''First Take'' feel different than other programs".&lt;ref name="Nesheim"/&gt;

The '''Chess World Cup 2015''' was a 128-player [[single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] [[chess]] tournament held in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], from 10 September to 5 October 2015. 

[[Sergey Karjakin]] won the competition on tie-breaks after a four-game final against [[Peter Svidler]]. Both finalists qualified for the [[World Chess Championship 2016#Candidates Tournament|2016 Candidates Tournament]].

The winner of the [[Chess World Cup 2013]], [[Vladimir Kramnik]], was defeated by [[Dmitry Andreikin]] in the third round.

==Format==
Matches consisted of two games (except for the final, which consisted of four). Players had 90 minutes for the first 40 moves followed by 30 minutes for the rest of the game with an [[Glossary of chess#Increment|addition]] of 30 seconds per move from the start of the game. If a match was tied after the regular games, tie breaks were played the next day. The format for the tie breaks was as follows:
* Two [[Fast chess|rapid]] games (25 minutes plus 10 seconds [[Glossary of chess#Increment|increment]]).
* If the score was tied after two rapid games, two rapid games (10 minutes plus 10 seconds increment).
* If the score was tied after four rapid games, the opponents play two [[Fast chess|blitz]] games (five minutes plus three seconds increment).
* If the score was tied after a pair of blitz games, an [[Fast_chess#Armageddon|armageddon]] game (in which a draw counts as a win for Black) was played. White had 5 minutes and Black had 4 minutes, with an increment of 3 seconds/move starting from move 61.

[[File:Folkestone racecourse, Westenhanger.jpg|thumb|Grandstand seen from the station]]
'''Folkestone Racecourse''' was a [[thoroughbred horse racing]] venue in southeast England, until it closed in 2012. It is located in [[Westenhanger]], by junction 11 of the [[M20 motorway]] and about two miles west of [[Folkestone]]. Since 2013 the venue has hosted the [[War and Peace show]] previously held at the [[The Hop Farm Country Park|Hop Farm]] at [[Beltring]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewarandpeacerevival.co.uk/ War and Peace Revival website ''(Retrieved 6 May 2013)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The course remains closed and all running rail and steeplechase fences have been removed. In May 2016 it was revealed that the land covered by the racecourse forms part of a plan to develop and build housing.

==History==
The history of the Westenhanger estate dates back to 1035 when it was owned by [[King Canute]]. The 14th century [[Westenhanger Castle]] can still be seen next to the main grandstand.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The race course was established in 1898, and was a right-handed undulating oval with a run in of 3f and a 7f straight chute.{{cn|date=January 2017}} The centre of the course is farmed, and has a reservoir fed by a pumping station on the west side of the oval. The [[East Stour, Kent|East Stour]] river runs along the western edge of the oval and under the straight course.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

In July 2012, [[Arena Leisure]] and [[Northern Racing]], the lessees of the racecourse announced the closure of the racecourse as a temporary measure. Outdated facilities and the delay of a project to build houses on part of the site were given as the reasons for the closure. It was announced that a final decision would be made in 2013.&lt;ref name=BBC19014895&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19014895 |title=Hereford and Folkestone racecourses to close |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folkestone held its last scheduled meeting on 18 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-20769372 |title=Folkestone Racecourse holds 'last' horse racing meeting |publisher=BBC News |date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arena Leisure stated in 2012 that the closure was temporary. In 2016 it was revealed that plans drawn up by [[Folkestone and Hythe (District)|Folkestone and Hythe]] Council include the racecourse area for building houses in a development known as Otterpool Garden Town. By December 2017 much of the racecourse infrastructure had fallen into disrepair and there was no prospect of any resumption of racing at the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mottershead|first1=Lee|title=Unkempt and unloved: Folkestone revisited five years on from its closure|url=https://www.racingpost.com/news/christmas-countdown/the-weeds-are-thriving-at-folkestone-where-racing-is-firmly-in-the-past/312226|website=Racing Post|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use by RAF==
The racecourse was first used by aviation when a flying meeting was held in September 1910. Three aircraft were present, watched by a large crowd.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lee |first= David W. |title= Action Stations Revisited, Volume 3 South East England |year=2010 |publisher= Crecy Publishing Ltd |isbn= 978-0-85979-110-6| page= 304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1940 and 1941 the racecourse was used as a decoy airfield with dummy aircraft placed to look like an active airfield.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; On 23 April 1944 [[No. 660 Squadron RAF|660 Squadron]], an army cooperation squadron of the [[Royal Air Force]], arrived at what was then known as RAF Westenhanger after the nearby village.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; The squadron based in a tented camp was equipped with [[Taylorcraft Auster|Auster Mark IV]] single-engined liaison aircraft and used the racecourse to practise operations with local army units.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; On 12 July 1944 the squadron of 12 Austers escorted by a [[Supermarine Walrus]] rescue flying boat left Westenhanger for France.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; The airfield was then restored back to use as a racecourse.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; Rubble from wartime buildings can be seen on the north side of the straight course where it meets the oval.

The '''Great Manmade River Stadium''' ('''GMR''' or '''GMMR''' stadium)  is a [[Soccer-specific stadium|football stadium]] situated just a few metres away from the [[11 June Stadium]] in the heart of [[Tripoli]]'s sporting city. The stadium is named after the [[Great Manmade River]]. The stadium has a capacity of around 20,000 and is currently the home of [[Libyan Premier League]] clubs [[Alwahda (Tripoli)|Al Wahda]], [[Attersana S.C.|Al Tersana]] and [[Alamn Alaam]].

The stadium was opened on 17 May 2000, and was celebrated with a [[friendly match]] between [[Middlesbrough F.C.]] and [[A.S. Bari]].
This ground has hosted matches at international level, and the most celebrated results on this ground were won by the likes of [[Almadina S.C.|Al Madina]], who defeated [[ES Tunis]] 2-1, and on 19 September 2006, [[Al Ittihad Tripoli|Al Ittihad]] defeated [[Al-Nahda (Omani football club)|Al Nahdha]] of [[Oman]] in the 2006-07 [[Arab Champions League]].

'''Harvard Stadium''' is a U-shaped [[college football]] stadium in the northeast [[United States]], located in the [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]] neighborhood of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. The stadium is owned and operated by [[Harvard University]] and is home to the [[Harvard Crimson football]] program. The stadium's [[seating capacity]] is 30,323.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocrimson.com/information/facilities/harvardstadium|title=Harvard|work=Harvard}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Built in 1903, it was a pioneering execution of [[reinforced concrete]] in the construction of large structures. Because of its early importance in these areas, and its influence on the design of later stadiums, it was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=BOS.8286|title=NRHP nomination for Harvard Stadium|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is the nation's oldest permanent concrete structure dedicated to intercollegiate athletics. It seated up to 57,166 in the past, as permanent steel stands (completing a straight-sided oval)&lt;ref name=avofstad&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:5h73r100b |work=Digital Commonwealth |location=Newton, Massachusetts) |title=Aerial view of Harvard Stadium |date=1930 |accessdate=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; were installed in the stadium's northeast end zone in 1929. They were torn down after the 1951 season, due to deterioration and reduced attendance. Afterward, there were smaller temporary steel bleachers across the stadium's open end until the building of the Murr Center (which is topped by the new scoreboard) in 1998.

Harvard Stadium hosted one Boston Patriots season in [[1970 Boston Patriots season|1970]]. It was their first season in the [[National Football League|NFL]] after the [[AFL–NFL merger]] and their last before becoming the [[New England Patriots]]. The team moved to [[Foxboro Stadium|Schaefer Stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts|Foxborough]] [[1971 New England Patriots season|the following season]].

==History==
Harvard Stadium was constructed on {{convert|31|acre}} of land known as Soldiers Field, donated to Harvard University by [[Henry Lee Higginson]] in 1890 as a memorial to Harvard men who had died in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] {{nowrap|(1861–1865).{{refn|{{cite book|author=Harvard University|title=Education, bricks and mortar: Harvard buildings and their contribution to the advancement of learning|chapter=Memorial Hall|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aRI8AAAAIAAJ|year=1949|page=82n}} }}}} The structure, similar in shape to the [[Panathenaic Stadium]], was completed in just 4½ months costing $310,000. Much of the funds raised came from a 25th reunion gift by Harvard's Class of 1879. It is the home of Harvard's [[American football|football]] team. The stadium also hosted the Crimson [[track and field]] teams until 1984 and was the home of the [[Boston Patriots]] during the 1970 season, until [[Schaefer Stadium]] opened the following year.

Lewis Jerome Johnson, professor of civil engineering at Harvard, was a consultant to the design team for the stadium. It is historically significant that this stadium represents the first vertical concrete structure to employ reinforced structural concrete. Prior to the erection of the stadium in 1902, reinforced structural concrete was used in horizontal, that is flooring, sidewalks, etc., design only. Prof. Johnson was the engineer of note responsible for incorporating the concept into the vertical structure of the stadium design. There is a plaque dedicating the stadium to his honor on the east end wall outside the stadium.

Harvard installed both [[FieldTurf]] and lights in 2006.&lt;ref name= "Harvard Stadium Information"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Stadium|url=https://www.bostoncannons.com/harvard-stadium|publisher=''Boston Cannons''|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2007 Harvard Crimson football team|2007]], Harvard played its first night game at the stadium, winning 24–17 over [[Brown Bears football|Brown University]] on September 22.&lt;ref name=hbrnnt&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/ncf/recap/_/id/272650108 |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |title=Harvard 24, Brown 17 |date=September 22, 2007|accessdate=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fbtbrn&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2007/9/23/football-topples-brown-in-historic-night/ |work=Harvard Crimson |location=(Cambridge, Massachusetts) |last=Glenn |first=Malcolm A. |title=Football topples Brown in historic night game |date=September 23, 2007 |accessdate=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on American Football===
In the early 20th century, [[American football]] was an extremely violent sport. 18 players died and 159 were seriously injured in 1905 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2003/09/first-and-100.html|title=First and 100|publisher=''The Harvard Magazine''|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a widespread movement to outlaw the game but U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] intervened and demanded the rules of the game be reformed. In 1906, Roosevelt met with representatives from 62 colleges and universities and formed the Intercollegiate Football Conference, the predecessor of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/football1.html|title=The 1905 Movement to Reform Football|publisher=Library of Congress document|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The committee's purpose was to develop a uniform set of rules and regulations to make the game safer.  A leading proposal, at the time, was widening the field to allow more running room and reduce serious collisions.  While it was popular among committee members, Harvard objected.  Their recently completed stadium could not accommodate a larger field.  Because of the permanent nature of Harvard Stadium, the proposal was rejected and the [[forward pass]] was legalized in April 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/22/sports/ncaafootball/22harvard.html?_r=0|title=Saturday Night Lights: Harvard Stadium Joins the 21st Century|publisher=''New York Times''|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harvard Stadium led to the creation of two of the most fundamental aspects of modern American football: standard field dimensions and the legal forward pass.

===Other events===
Harvard Stadium was the site of the [[United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|U.S. Olympic Trials]] for men's track and field in 1920, 1924, and [[1928 United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|1928]].

It is also the host of [[music festival]]s like the [[Amandla Festival]], where [[Jamaica]]n reggae legend [[Bob Marley]] performed a historic concert in 1979. [[Janis Joplin]] performed her last show at the stadium in 1970, shortly before her death. During the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] held in Los Angeles, the stadium hosted several [[Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics|soccer]] preliminaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf 1984 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 1. Part 1. pp. 129-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[Boston Cannons]], a professional lacrosse team for [[Major League Lacrosse]], moved their home site to the stadium. They previously played at [[Boston University]]'s [[Nickerson Field]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcom Glenn|Malcom A. Glenn]], [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=517262 Improved Stadium Scores Pro Team], Harvard Crimson, February 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard installed [[FieldTurf]] and lights in 2006,&lt;ref name="Harvard Stadium Information"/&gt; allowing it to become the home stadium of the [[Boston Cannons]].&lt;!--  Harvard played its first night game at the stadium in [[2007 Harvard Crimson football team|2007]], winning 24–17 over [[Brown Bears football|Brown]] on September 22.--&gt;

Beginning on April 11, 2009, Harvard Stadium became the home field of the [[Boston Breakers (WPS)|Boston Breakers]] of the [[Women's Professional Soccer]] (WPS) league when they beat [[Saint Louis Athletica]] 2–0.

Harvard and the [[Boston Bruins]] have begun talks about making a bid for the stadium to serve as the host of the [[National Hockey League]]'s 2024 [[NHL Winter Classic]] to coincide with the Boston Bruins' 100th anniversary year. If awarded the game, the Boston Bruins are expected to ask the NHL to have the [[Montreal Canadiens]] serve as the opposition.

==Location==
[[File:Harvard stadium 2009h.JPG|thumb|The stadium in 2009]]

Although most of Harvard's campus is in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], the stadium and most other intercollegiate athletic facilities, along with [[Harvard Business School]], lie to the south, across the [[Charles River]], in the nearby Allston neighborhood of Boston.  The stadium is the most iconic piece of the Soldiers Field athletic complex, which also includes the baseball stadium, outdoor track, an artificial turf field hockey/lacrosse field, two soccer stadiums, pools, Beren Tennis Center (outdoor), the Gordon Indoor Track, Dillon Fieldhouse, [[Lavietes Pavilion]], and [[Bright Hockey Center]].  Newell Boathouse, home of Harvard's men's crew, lies across Soldiers Field Road on the banks of the Charles.

The stadium's horseshoe opens to the northeast, towards the river, and the press box is at the top of the northwest sideline's grandstand.
The running track has been removed; it was non-standard, with long straights and tight turns, and the outside lanes were very near the stadium walls.

This is a list of '''foreign players''' in the '''[[Adeccoligaen|Norwegian First Division]]''', which commenced play in 1949. The following players must meet both of the following two criteria:
#Have played at least one Premier League game. Players who were signed by Premier League clubs, but only played in lower league, cup and/or European games, or did not play in any competitive games at all, are not included.
#Are considered foreign, determined by the following:
::A player is considered foreign if he is not eligible to play for [[Norway national football team]], more specifically:
::*If a player has been capped on international level, the national team is used; if he has been capped by more than one country, the highest level (or the most recent) team is used.
::*If a player has not been capped on international level, his country of birth is used, except those who were born abroad from Norwegian parents or moved to Norway at a young age, and those who clearly indicated to have switched his nationality to another nation.

'''Priestfield Stadium''' (popularly known simply as '''Priestfield''' and officially known from 2007 to 2010 as '''KRBS Priestfield Stadium''' and from 2011 as '''MEMS Priestfield Stadium''' for sponsorship purposes) is a [[Association football|football]] stadium in [[Gillingham, Medway|Gillingham]], Kent.  It has been the home of [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham Football Club]] since the club's formation in 1893, and was also the temporary home of [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Football Club]] for two seasons during the 1990s.  The stadium has also hosted women's and youth international football matches and a [[London Broncos]] rugby league match.

The stadium underwent extensive redevelopment during the late 1990s, which has brought its capacity down from nearly 20,000 to a current figure of 11,582.  It has four [[all-seater]] stands, all constructed since 1997, although one is only of a temporary nature.  There are also conference and banqueting facilities and a nightspot named The Factory. Despite having invested heavily in its current stadium, Gillingham F.C. has plans to relocate to a new stadium.

== History ==
New Brompton Football Club, the forerunner of Gillingham Football Club, formed in June 1893. At the same time an area of land in Gillingham was acquired by the club's founders, the purchase being funded through an issue of 1,500 £1 shares.&lt;ref name=p7&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Priestfield1908.jpg|thumb|right|400px|A view of the ground in 1908, taken from the Rainham end of the ground]]
By 1908, the total number of seats had been increased to 800 and terracing added at the [[Rainham, Kent|Rainham]] end of the ground.  In 1912, the club's first Supporters' Association was formed, its initial project being to raise the necessary funds to construct terracing at the opposite end of the ground.&lt;ref name=p6&gt;{{cite book
  | last =  Triggs
  | title = Gillingham Football Club: A Chronology 1893–1984
  | page = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two years later the club, which had changed its name to Gillingham F.C. in 1913, secured a bank loan of £1,570 which was used to build a new grandstand, but just a month after it was completed the stand was severely damaged by high winds, which ripped off the roof and twisted most of the ironwork.  The club sued the contractors, but it took a further three months for the damage to be repaired.&lt;ref name=p10&gt;{{cite book
  | last =  Triggs
  | title = Gillingham Football Club: A Chronology 1893–1984

A new attendance record was set in 1924 when an [[FA Cup]] match against [[Football League First Division|First Division]] leaders [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] drew a crowd of 19,472.&lt;ref name=p12&gt;{{cite book
  | last =  Triggs

The facilities at Priestfield were highlighted as one of the club's strengths in the brochure, which listed the ground's capacity as "between 25,000 and 30,000" but stated that plans had been drawn up to increase the capacity to 50,000, with 5,000&amp;nbsp;seats.&lt;ref name=p16&gt;{{cite book

  | pages = 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Priestfield1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The exterior of the Main Stand in the mid-1980s]]
The ground underwent its most extensive redevelopment to date in 1955, at a total cost of £28,500.  The previously sloping pitch was levelled, the terracing that occupied part of the Gordon Road side of the ground replaced, and new covered accommodation, known as the Stanley Stand, erected between the Rainham End and Gordon Road Stand.&lt;ref name=p23&gt;{{cite book
  | last =  Triggs
  | title = Gillingham Football Club: A Chronology 1893–1984

New owner [[Paul Scally]] took over at the club in 1995 and soon instigated a programme of redevelopment which completely transformed the formerly run-down ground.  The closed stand was replaced with a new Gordon Road Stand in 1997 at a cost of more than £2&amp;nbsp;million.  Two years later the Rainham End terracing was replaced with a new all-seater stand, with the sports centre behind it demolished and replaced with a car park.&lt;ref name="OS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/PriestfieldStadium/0,,10416,00.html |publisher=Gillingham F.C. |title=The Changing Face of KRBS Priestfield |date=7 September 2007 |accessdate=6 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115155957/http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/PriestfieldStadium/0%2C%2C10416%2C00.html |archivedate=15 November 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RainhamEndGordonRoadStand.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Rainham End and Gordon Road Stand during a match in 2007]]
The main stand on the northern side of the pitch was demolished in 1999, along with a section of away terracing, to be replaced with a new state-of-the-art facility dubbed the Medway Stand, but the work was beset by problems.  Due to serious delays with the building of the new stand, the club was forced to spend most of the subsequent season first with that side of the ground completely empty, then later with building work ongoing.  Supporters were not able to sit in the new stand until the latter stages of the [[1999–2000 in English football|1999–2000 season]], and even then many of the facilities had not been finished.&lt;ref name="OS" /&gt;  The stand also caused severe financial problems for the club, as its facilities eventually cost significantly more than the original estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11737_2224411,00.html|title=Gills May Be Forced to Sell|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=2 October 2008|author=Stephen Bateman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth side of the ground was redeveloped in 2003 when the Town End terracing was removed and a temporary stand put in its place, named after the late football commentator and Gillingham supporter [[Brian Moore (commentator)|Brian Moore]].  It was hoped that work would begin on a permanent Brian Moore Stand in 2004,&lt;ref name="OS" /&gt; but due to talk of relocating the club to a new ground and the club's current financial problems, this has been put on hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/aroundthegrounds/Gillingham---Priestfield-Stadium.2984470.jp|title=Gillingham – Priestfield Stadium|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|accessdate=7 November 2007|date=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 2007, the stadium was officially renamed '''KRBS Priestfield Stadium''' as part of a sponsorship deal that lasted three years with the [[Kent Reliance Building Society]].&lt;ref name="KRBS"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 another such deal led to the rebranding of the stadium as '''MEMS Priestfield Stadium'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=23 May 2011 |url=http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.com/page/PressReleases/0,,10416~2355939,00.html |title=New sponsor named..... |publisher=Gillingham F.C. |accessdate=7 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512145850/http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.com/page/PressReleases/0%2C%2C10416~2355939%2C00.html |archivedate=12 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and facilities ==
[[File:PlanOfPriestfield.png|thumb|right|300px|A plan of the stadium's layout]]
The pitch is surrounded by four [[All-seater stadium|all-seater stands]] – the Medway Stand, the Rainham End, the Gordon Road Stand and the Brian Moore Stand. All are covered with the exception of the Brian Moore Stand.  The Medway Stand, which replaced the old Main Stand and part of the terracing at each end, is the largest and northernmost of the four. It has two tiers with a row of twenty executive boxes between the top and bottom tier. The stand also contains the changing rooms, physiotherapy facilities, club offices and club shop.&lt;ref name="OS" /&gt;  The Rainham End, located behind the goal at the eastern end of the pitch, opened in 1999 and houses 2,400&amp;nbsp;fans.  This stand, like the terrace it replaced, is known for housing the club's most vocal supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsf.org.uk/ground-guide/stadiums/gillingham/priestfield-stadium/ |title=Gillingham |publisher=Football Supporters' Federation |accessdate=8 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014213458/http://fsf.org.uk/ground-guide/stadiums/gillingham/priestfield-stadium/ |archivedate=14 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Gordon Road Stand, which seats 2,600, was opened in 1997 and is opposite the Medway Stand.  Due to planning requirements, the stand had a height restriction placed upon it, making it significantly lower than the other three sides of the ground, and due to the road layout behind it is narrower at one end than the other.&lt;ref name="OS" /&gt;  A gantry for television cameras is located on the roof of this stand.&lt;ref name="FGG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10372~1130322,00.html |title=Gillingham Travel Details |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |accessdate=5 November 2008 |date=9 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003075224/http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10372~1130322%2C00.html |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Priestfield2.jpg|400px|thumb|left|The slope of the old Gillingham End is apparent in this photo from the mid-1980s.]]
Opposite the Rainham End is the Brian Moore Stand.  This stand is a temporary one, and accommodates visiting supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/TravelMatchPack/0,,10416~405497,00.html |title=Travel match pack |publisher=Gillingham F.C. |accessdate=8 November 2007 |date=20 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040624104139/http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/TravelMatchPack/0%2C%2C10416~405497%2C00.html |archivedate=24 June 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It occupies the site of the former Town End terracing, which was unusual in that it had a pronounced slope, with one end of the terracing being higher up than the other.  In 1955 the pitch, which previously sloped at that end of the stadium, was levelled out but the gradient of the Town End was left unchanged.&lt;ref name="p23" /&gt;

The state of the stadium's pitch caused the club severe problems in 2003.  A number of fixtures had to be postponed due to the state of the pitch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/01/36341.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20050413044006/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/01/36341.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 April 2005 |title=Gills topple Wednesday|publisher=The Football Association|accessdate=22 November 2007|date=8 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was described as resembling a ploughed field,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2003/03/05/sfggil05.xml |title=Huckerby class tells|work=The Daily Telegraph|author=Steve Thomson|accessdate=22 November 2007|date=4 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the surface had to be heavily sanded before an [[FA Cup]] match against [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/2671827.stm|title=Leeds held at Gillingham|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 November 2007|date=13 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of the season, taking advantage of the demolition of the old Town End, which allowed better access to the pitch, the club had the drainage system replaced and a completely new pitch laid.&lt;ref name="OS" /&gt;

[[File:BrianMooreStand2012.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The current Brian Moore Stand, at the Gillingham end of the stadium, has been constructed on a temporary basis only.]]
Added to the new stands were several new developments. The Conference and Banqueting Centre, which is located behind the Rainham End, comprises the Great Hall, which can accommodate up to 600&amp;nbsp;delegates for events, and twenty smaller delegate rooms.&lt;ref name="Ven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.priestfield.com/|title=Priestfield Conference &amp; Banqueting|accessdate=5 November 2008|publisher=Gillingham F.C}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Centre is connected to the Medway Stand, thus allowing views from the banqueting suite onto the pitch,&lt;ref name="OS" /&gt; and is also licensed for wedding ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medway.gov.uk/index/community/registeroffice/ceremonyvenues/27958.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907171719/http://www.medway.gov.uk/index/community/registeroffice/ceremonyvenues/27958.htm|archivedate=7 September 2007|title=Birth, death and marriage registration|publisher=Medway Council|accessdate=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Blues Rock Café nightspot, located within the Medway Stand, is open between four and five nights a week and stages live music and screenings of major sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/BluesCafe/0,,10416,00.html |title=Details of the club's premier nightspot |publisher=Gillingham F.C. |accessdate=8 November 2007 |date=7 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115155753/http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/BluesCafe/0%2C%2C10416%2C00.html |archivedate=15 November 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The club purchased many of the fixtures and fittings for these new developments at discounted prices when the furnishings of the [[Millennium Dome]] were sold off upon its closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20030119/ai_n9682090|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611184146/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20030119/ai_n9682090|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 June 2008|title=Football: He paid £1 for the club.

Despite the stadium's new facilities, Priestfield is still viewed in a negative light in some circles.  In 2004, it was voted the worst football ground in England by a poll in the [[The Observer|Observer]] newspaper, although most of the comments made in the poll concerned the town of Gillingham itself, rather than the actual stadium as a building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,1324085,00.html|title=Simply the worst|work=The Observer |author=Gemma Clarke|accessdate=5 November 2007|date=10 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future ==
Gillingham chairman [[Paul Scally]] has made it clear that he intends to relocate the club away from its current stadium, announcing in September 2003 that "there is no future for the club at the Priestfield".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/g/gillingham/3130036.stm|title=Scally considers Gills future|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 November 2007|date=22 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, the club outlined plans for a new stadium at [[Cuxton]] but abandoned them soon afterwards due to the cost of improving transport links to the site.  At the time Scally stated that he anticipated the club moving within four years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/3857867.stm|title=Gillingham vow to remain in Kent|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 November 2007|date=1 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by 2007 the proposed date had been pushed back to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/g/gillingham/6286217.stm|title=Gills targeting 2010 stadium move|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 November 2007|date=22 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, he again identified Mill Hill, on the east of the A289 Yokosuka Way, as his preferred site for a new stadium, re-iterated that this was necessary for the club to have ambitions of future [[Premier League]] football, and that he would be launching a bond scheme to fund the early stages of the development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.com/documents/gfc-supporters-letter-rev166-3639162.pdf|title=A letter to all supporters from the chairman|publisher=Gillingham F.C.|accessdate=23 March 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324085317/http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.com/documents/gfc-supporters-letter-rev166-3639162.pdf|archivedate=24 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the proposed move, the club promoted its facilities, in conjunction with [[Medway]] Council, as a possible training base for athletes competing in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medway.gov.uk/london2012/55326/56285.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630233023/http://www.medway.gov.uk/london2012/55326/56285.htm|archivedate=30 June 2007|title=Gillingham Football Club|publisher=Medway Council|accessdate=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|The Medway Stand is fully equipped with physio rooms, a hydrotherapy pool, a sauna and steam rooms to assist with the athletes' training, and a lounge bar, a cinema and a snooker room for them to enjoy during their free time.  The club's offices, media centre and press room could also provide the coaches with a good administrative base.  We are excited about the prospect of international athletes benefiting from our excellent facilities in preparation for London 2012.}}

In December 2007, Gillingham shareholders passed a resolution to sell the ground to Priestfield Developments Ltd, a company wholly owned by Paul Scally, for £9.8m as part of a restructuring of the club's debts.  The deal was to allow three years use of the stadium at £1&amp;nbsp;p.a., with the club meeting running costs, with tenure secured for a further seven years at a rent as yet unspecified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10416~1196619,00.html |publisher=Gillingham F.C. |title=Results from the EGM |accessdate=22 December 2007 |date=21 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105063132/http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10416~1196619%2C00.html |archivedate=5 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10416~1184435,00.html |title=A Note from the Chairman |publisher=Gillingham F.C. |accessdate=22 December 2007 |date=22 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213191017/http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10416~1184435%2C00.html |archivedate=13 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, however, the club purchased the stadium back for around 10% of the fee paid by Priestfield Developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jul/21/gillingham-buy-back-priestfield-stadium|title=Mystery of £1m deal for Gillingham to buy back Priestfield Stadium|work=The Guardian|date=21 July 2011|accessdate=30 August 2012|first=Matt|last=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2620">'''Robotniczy Klub Sportowy „Skała"''' ('Workers Sport Club "Rock"', abbreviated '''RKS''') was a [[Jew]]ish [[Communist]] sports organization in [[Wyszków]], Poland, active during the [[interbellum]] years. Founded in 1928, RKS was one of two Jewish sports organizations in the city (the other being [[Maccabi (sports)|Makabi]]).&lt;ref name="z"&gt;Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza (Poland).

Bloomington, Ind: Indiana University Press, 1998. p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; The club had a football team.&lt;ref name="w"/&gt;

RKS had initially appealed to Jewish workers across party lines, with the slogan that "...if you are a worker, you belong in this club". However, the political unity became short-lived.&lt;ref name="w"/&gt; The communists seized control over the club.&lt;ref&gt;Szczepański, Janusz.

RKS had more than 200 members (100 men, 70 women and 40 children).&lt;ref&gt;Krzemień, Leszek.

'''Sauðárkróksvöllur''' is a football stadium in [[Sauðárkrókur]], [[Iceland]].

Sauðárkróksvöllur has a standing spectator capacity of about 2,500, but no permanent seating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootball.org/ground.php/country/ISL/ground/2000000407|title=Sauðárkróksvöllur|publisher=World Football.org|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The open-air stadium opened in 2004, and has a grass surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It was built with a combination of public and private funding for the Icelandic Games held in the summer of 2004.&lt;ref name=tindastoll1309/&gt;
The stadium was also used for the 2004 and 2009 youth games, the 2006 and 2007 Icelandic Athletic championships and various other large or small events.
Sauðárkróksvöllur is used by the local sports club, [[UMF Tindastóll]], which helps maintain the pitch with the aid of volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Walter &amp; Russell at Falcons at Raiders 11-2-08.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Players not actively participating in a game and coaches remain on the sidelines during play]]

The '''"sidelines"''' are the white or colored lines which mark the outer boundaries of a sports field, running parallel to each other and perpendicular to the [[Goal line (American football)|goal line]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportingcharts.com/dictionary/nfl/sidelines.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The sidelines are also where the coaching staff and players out of play operate during a game. The area outside the sidelines is said to be [[out of bounds]]. The term is predominantly in use in [[American football]], [[Canadian football]], [[field lacrosse]] and [[basketball]].
[[File:TO EaglesCowboys Sideline.jpg|left|thumb|250px|In gridiron football, a player who steps onto the sidelines during play is considered to be [[out of bounds]]]]
In [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]] and [[association football]], they are known as [[touch-line]]s. The foul line is a similar concept in [[baseball]]. Sports in which the playing surface is bounded by walls, such as [[ice hockey]], [[box lacrosse]], and [[indoor American football|indoor football]], do not use sidelines; in these sports, coaches and reserve players are positioned in recessed benches behind the walls.

The sideline can be used metaphorically to refer to players who have been "benched", meaning that they have been taken out of the game purposefully by the coaching staff due to poor performance in the game or previous play.  Establishing shots of these players may be used by televised sports programs to indicate potential roster switches, or to build a narrative of the failure or success of the coaching staff's decision.  Likewise, images of the sideline may suggest that the highlighted player had done something of interest outside the confines of play.  For example, in American football, [[Gatorade shower|dousing the head coach with water or sports drink]] is a popular way of celebrating crucial victories, established as a tradition by the [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League]] in the mid-1980s.

The term "to be sidelined" refers to a player in a sports event who is unable to play (e.g. confined to the sideline) for injury, suspension, or other similar reasons.  This term has spread into a business context; a project that has been "sidelined" is no longer a major concern or objective of the proponent company.

==Play==
A game of snow snake is played by four teams, called "corners", who compete in trying to throw their wooden "snow snakes" the farthest along a long trough, or track, of snow. The game is divided into rounds, and in a round each team gets four throws. At the end of each round, two points are awarded to the team of the person who made the farthest throw in the round, and one point is awarded for the second farthest throw. Play continues until one of the teams wins, by achieving a certain predetermined number of points (usually 7 or 11).&lt;ref name=gan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ganondagan.org/articles/SnowSnake.html |title=Snow Snake, a  Sport Steeped in Tradition |last1=Llewellyn |first1=Carol White |year=2009 |work=Ganondagan |publisher=Friends of Ganondagan |accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two roles on a snow snake team: the Player, and the Goaler. The main role of a Goaler is to craft and maintain a team's wooden "snow snakes" in between games. The Goaler is also tasked with selecting which will be used for each throw during the game. A Player, meanwhile, is a player who actually throws the snow snakes during a game.&lt;ref name=gan /&gt;

==Equipment==
The poles used in the game, collectively known as "snow snakes", have different names depending on their length. The smallest poles used are the six-inch-long "snow darts".&lt;ref name=minn /&gt; The next size up is the three-foot-long "short snake",&lt;ref name=onon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onondaganation.org/culture/sports_snowsnake.html |title=SPORTS - Snowsnake |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2007 |work=Onondanga Nation: People of the Hills |publisher=Onondanga Nation |accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as a "mud cat".&lt;ref name=gan /&gt; Longer poles are known only as "snow snakes", and can be anywhere from six to ten feet in length.&lt;ref name=minn /&gt; Snow snakes can be made from a variety of materials. In the Sioux tribe, they were traditionally made of bone, with feathers trailing behind for symbolic decoration,&lt;ref name=minn /&gt; while other tribes traditionally used native North American hardwoods, such as [[maple]], [[oak]], [[malus|apple]], [[hickory]], and [[juneberry]].&lt;ref name=gan /&gt; In modern times, other hardwoods not traditionally available, such as [[ebony]], have become popular materials for snow snakes.&lt;ref name=gan /&gt; Many players customize their snow snakes, by decorating them with colorful designs, or adding minor modifications, such as waxing the wooden surface.&lt;ref name=minn /&gt; 

The trough, or track, that snow snakes are thrown down is typically five inches deep, rising up in a slope at the end where the players stand.&lt;ref name=gan /&gt; In modern times, some groups will add obstacles like jumps or snow barriers to their tracks, for added interest.&lt;ref name=minn /&gt;

==History==
According to the Iroquois oral tradition, the game of snow snake dates back more than 500 years, to before the arrival of Europeans in North America. Originally a form of communication between villages, the throwing of "snow snakes" in a trough of snow developed into a competitive sport during long winters when the long track was not used for communication.&lt;ref name=gan /&gt; The name "snow snake" is said to have come from the serpentine wiggling motion of the poles as they slide down the icy track.&lt;ref name=rite /&gt;

'''Stadio Angelo Massimino''' (previously known as '''Stadio Cibali''') is a multi-use stadium in [[Catania]], Italy. It is used mostly for [[association football|football]] matches and the home of [[Calcio Catania]]. The stadium was built in 1935 by architect Raffaele Leone on behalf of the company owned by the engineer Antonio Ferro and holds 20,266. It was renamed in 2002 after former Catania chairman [[Angelo Massimino]].

[[Calcio Catania|Catania]] was banned from playing any [[Serie A]] matches inside the stadium from 14 February 2007 until 30 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6361463.stm|title=Catania lose stadium ban appeal|date=22 February 2007|accessdate=1 November 2010|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the violence that occurred on 2 February 2007 outside the stadium in the [[2007 Catania football violence|clash]] against [[U.S._Citt%C3%A0_di_Palermo|Palermo]] which resulted in the death of a Police Officer.

The '''Twin City Handicap''' was an American [[Thoroughbred racing|Thoroughbred horse race]] first run in 1884 at [[Sheepshead Bay Race Track]] in [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn|Sheepshead Bay]], [[New York (state)|New York]] where it continued annually through 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drf.uky.edu/catalog/1900s/drf1909090201/drf1909090201_1_8 |title=The Twin City Handicap |publisher=Daily Racing Form at University of Kentucky Archives |date=1909-09-02 |accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following passage by the  [[New York State Legislature]] of the [[Hart–Agnew Law]] anti-wagering [[Bill (law)|bill]] that resulted in the closure of all racetracks in the state of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/12/08/118496663.pdf|title=RACING FUNDS FOR THE CLERGY; Amasa Thernton Got $250 on Account to interest Friendly Ministers.

In 1917 the Coney Island Jockey Club, operators of the Sheepshead Bay Race Track, transferred their race titles to [[The Jockey Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drf.uky.edu/catalog/1910s/drf1917082201/drf1917082201_2_9 |title=Donate Title to Old Stakes |publisher=Daily Racing Form at University of Kentucky Archives |date= 1917-08-17 |accessdate=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in 1924 [[Belmont Park]] revived the Twin City Handicap. Won by Spot Cash, the first event at Belmont Park was run on a track made sloppy by a heavy rainstorm that the jockeys and their horses had to endure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drf.uky.edu/catalog/1920s/drf1924091001/drf1924091001_1_8 |title=Spot Cash In Front: Races through Heavy Rainstorm |publisher=Daily Racing Form at University of Kentucky Archives |date= 1924-09-10 |accessdate=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the next few years saw the race continue to attract top level runners, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall Street Crash of October 29, 1929]] and ensuing [[Great Depression]] brought further setbacks to horse racing and the race would be canceled. The final running of the Twin City Handicap took place on September 11, 1930 when future [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|U.S. Racing Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Raymond Workman]] guided [[James Butler (grocer)|James Butler]]'s three-year-old colt [[Questionnaire (horse)|Questionnaire]] to a two-length victory while being eased up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/59866953/ |title=Questionnaire Rounds Out Ninth Victory by Winning Twin City 'Cap |publisher=Brooklyn Daily Eagle (Brooklyn, New York)  Page 26|date= 1930-09-12|accessdate=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
