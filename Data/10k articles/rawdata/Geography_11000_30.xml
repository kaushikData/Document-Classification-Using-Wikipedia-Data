The '''B1145''' runs for about {{convert|52|mi|km}} through the county of [[Norfolk]], [[England]], between [[King’s Lynn]] and [[Mundesley]].&lt;ref&gt;County A to Z Atlas, Street &amp; Road maps Norfolk, {{ISBN|978-1-84348-614-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The road is an alternative route to the [[A47 road|A47]] between King's Lynn and [[Norwich]] by way of the [[A1067 road|A1067]] from [[Bawdeswell]] onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dervman.com/theb1145.htm Website dedicated to the B1145]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This ancient route predates the [[Norman Conquest]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/English%20sites/1970.html Reference to the Norman Road]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Normans in Norfolk'', by Sue Margeson, Fabienne Seillier and Andrew Rogerson, Pub:1994,Link between Norman Castles in Norfolk, {{ISBN|0-903101-62-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained the main east-west route through the county until the 17th century. It can be seen quiet clearly on William Faden’s map of Norfolk,&lt;ref&gt;Faden’s Map of Norfolk 1797, Digitally redrawn in 2005 by Andrew Macnair. North Central Map {{ISBN|978-0-9550398-2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was surveyed between 1790 and 1794. This map, the first large-scale map (at one inch to the mile) of the whole county, is a record of the landscape and transport system of the county of Norfolk in late 18th century and shows that despite the [[Inclosure Act|Parliamentary Enclosure]] of the early 19th century the route has changed very little. Much of the route on the map is highlighted in a pale pink, which marks it out as an important artery of the time.

Part of the roads route lies directly on the line of a [[Roman road]] between a point {{convert|0.8|mi|km}} west of [[North Elmham]] for the distance of {{convert|4.8|mi|km}} to where the road reaches the village of [[Bawdeswell]].&lt;ref&gt;OS Explorer Map 238 – Dereham &amp; Aylsham, Castle Acre &amp; Reepham. {{ISBN|0-319-23810-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route is dissected by several Roman roads, including the [[Peddars Way]] in the [[North West Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|North West]] of Norfolk.

Road schemes at Bawdeswell, Aylsham and North Walsham have created interruptions to the original route, although the vast majority of it remains intact.

==Coaching route==
The B1145 also was part of the King's Lynn–to–[[Great Yarmouth]] coaching route.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northnorfolkinns.co.uk/inns/bull.shtml The Bull Inn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924122702/http://www.northnorfolkinns.co.uk/inns/bull.shtml |date=24 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the route at [[Litcham]] stands The Bull Inn, a 17th-century coaching inn of which some parts date further back to the 14th century. The Bull provided the first change of [[horse]]s on this coaching route out of King’s Lynn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4378">The '''Ben-Gurion International Airport Garden''' is a garden outside Terminal 3 of [[Ben-Gurion International Airport]] on the outskirts of [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]], designed by the architecture firm of [[Shlomo Aronson]].

==History==
Originally, the design of the airport included one parking garage but at the suggestion of local lead architect [[Ram Karmi]], the garage was split in two structures in order to provide a space for the Central Garden.    Because of its location, the garden is meant to be experienced from “particular elevated  vantage points as a portrait”&lt;ref&gt;Loon, 2007, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; rather than by movement through it.  The placement of the garden also provides a view out to the surrounding landscape as opposed to a view of the facade of the parking structure.  The garden is meant to provide an abstract interpretation of the regional landscape from ocean to mountains.

==Layout==
[[Image:Ben Gurion International Airport P5310006.JPG|thumb|right|''Figure 1'': The Promenade at the Central Garden of the Ben-Gurion International Airport]]
[[Image:Ben Gurion International Airport P5310005.JPG|thumb|right|''Figure 2'': The "Mediterranean Sea" at the Central Garden of the Ben-Gurion International Airport]]
The overall concept was for the design, which includes a larger {{convert|65|acre|sing=on}} site that includes a road and an interchange in addition to the {{convert|5|acre|sing=on}} Central Garden, was for it to relate strongly to the surrounding landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, 2005, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Plants common to the area were selected based on their regional presence.  The gradual elevation change (approximately {{convert|15|ft|m}}&lt;ref&gt;Loon,  2007, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;) within the garden is meant to symbolize the ascent from [[Tel Aviv]] to [[Jerusalem]] while also accommodating the practical requirement of the connecting various elevations of the parking garages with adjacent roads.  Aronson symbolizes the [[Mediterranean]] coastline through the formal arrangement of materials like stone (a local limestone) and stainless steel.  Gravel is used to represent the beaches of the western border of [[Israel]], and a grid of palm trees recalls the seaside promenades that are growing in popularity within [[Israel]].  The grid arrangement also references the agricultural plantings of palm trees in the region.  With the shift in elevation through the site comes a change from paved surface to planted areas of wheat fields, grasses, and orange groves.  Small channels of water run through the garden, using a traditional technique for areas prone to rapid evaporation and indicating the need for human intervention in hydrating the arid landscape.  The uppermost terrace contains a grove of olive trees, a tree common to the [[Judean Mountains]] around [[Jerusalem]] and the highest elevations within the country.   [[Shlomo Aronson]] and project architect Barbara Aronson intended for the garden to be an abstraction of the region that allows visitors to gain a “deeper feeling of place”&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, 2005, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of religious or political affiliations.

==Symbolism==
Aronson says the Central Garden was designed as a "connective experience" that links up with the agrarian landscape along the route to [[Jerusalem]], with its citrus orchards, agricultural fields, olive groves, and stone terraces.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson,  1998, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The Ben-Gurion Airport Central Garden won an Award of Honor in the Professional General Design Category from the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] in 2005.

[[File:Celts in Europe.png|thumb|Map of Celtic-influenced regions of Europe]]
'''Celtic toponymy''' is the study of place names wholly or partially of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] origin. These names are found throughout continental Europe, [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[Anatolia]] and, latterly, through various other parts of the globe not originally occupied by [[Celts]].

==Celtic languages==
{{main|Proto-Celtic language}}
The [[Proto-Indo-European language]] developed into various daughter languages, including the [[Proto-Celtic language]]. In Proto-Celtic ("PC"), the Proto-Indo-European ("PIE") sound *''p'' [[Proto-Celtic language#Consonants|disappeared]], perhaps through an intermediate *''{{IPA|ɸ}}''. After that, languages derived from Proto-Celtic changed PC *''k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;'' into either *''p'' or *''k'' (see: [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages]]). In P-Celtic languages, PC *''k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;'' changed into *''p''. In Q-Celtic dialects it developed into /''k''/. Modern Celticists believe these changes happened after the split between [[Insular Celtic languages]] and the [[Continental Celtic languages]].

P-Celtic languages include the Continental [[Gaulish language]] and the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] branch of Insular Celtic. [[Common Brittonic]] is the ancestor of [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]].

Ancient Q-Celtic languages include the Continental [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]] and the [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] branch of Insular Celtic. Goidelic is the ancestor of the Gaelic languages [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]].

Deutschlands Ortsnamen als Denkmäler keltischer Vorzeit''. [[Frankfurt am Main]].&lt;/ref&gt; This may be so, since between the 2nd and 4th centuries, the area around the present day German university town of Tübingen was settled by a Celtic tribe with Germanic tribal elements mixed in. The element tub- in Tübingen could possibly arise from a Celtic ''dubo-'', s.m., 'dark, black; sad; wild'. As found in the [[Anglo-Irish]] placenames of [[Dublin]], [[Devlin (disambiguation)|Devlin]], Dowling, [[Doolin]] and [[Ballindoolin]]. Perhaps the reference is to the darkness of the river waters that flow near the town; if so, then the name can be compared to the English [[Tubney]], [[Tubbanford]], [[Tub Mead]] and [[Tub Hole]] in England. Compare the late Vulgar Latin ''tubeta'' 'morass', from [[Gaulish]]. The root is found in [[Old Irish]] ''dub'' &gt; [[Irish language|Irish]] ''dubh'', [[Old Welsh]] ''dub'' &gt; [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''du'', [[Old Cornish]] ''duw'' &gt; [[Middle Cornish]] ''du'', [[Breton language|Breton]] ''du'' [[Gaulish]] ''dubo-'', ''dubis'', all meaning 'black; dark'

===Switzerland===
Switzerland, especially the [[Swiss Plateau]], has many Celtic ([[Gaulish language|Gaulish]]) toponyms. This old layer of names was overlaid with Latin names in the [[Gallo-Roman]] period,&lt;ref&gt;such as [[Basle]], Latin ''Basilea'', from the personal name ''Basilius'', ultimately of Greek origin,&lt;/ref&gt; and, from the medieval period, with [[Alemannic German]]&lt;ref&gt;such as [[Berne]], founded 1191&lt;/ref&gt; and Romance&lt;ref&gt;such as [[Neuchâtel]], founded 1011&lt;/ref&gt; names.

For some names, there is uncertainty as to whether they are Gaulish or Latin in origin. 
In some rare cases, such as [[Frick, Switzerland]], there have even been competing suggestions of Gaulish, Latin and Alemannic etymologies.&lt;ref&gt;''Frick'' has been derived from (a) a Celtic word for "confluence", cognate with ''fork'', (b) an Alemannic personal name ''Fricco'' and (c) Latin ''ferra ricia'' "iron mine, ironworks".&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of toponyms with established Gaulish etymology:
*[[Solothurn]], from ''Salodurum''. The ''-durum'' element means "doors, gates; palisade; town". The etymology of the ''salo-'' element is unclear.
*[[Thun]], Berne: ''dunum'' "fort"
*[[Windisch]], Aargau, Latin ''[[Vindonissa]]'': first element from *''windo-'' "white"
*[[Winterthur]], Zürich, Latin ''[[Vitudurum]]'' or ''Vitodurum'', from ''vitu'' "willow" and ''durum''
*[[Yverdon-les-Bains]], from ''Eburodunum'', from ''eburo-'' "[[Taxus baccata|yew]]" and ''dunum'' "fort".&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Maier, ''Kleines Lexikon der Namen und Wörter keltischen Ursprungs'',  2010, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=HVCyYuBGQ5sC&amp;pg=PA51 p. 51].
[[Julius Pokorny]], [[IEW]] (1959:325), s.v. "ē̆reb(h)-, ō̆rob(h)- 'dark reddish-brown colour'": "alb.-ligur.-kelt.-germ. ''eburo-'' 'rowan, mountain ash, yew, evergreen tree with poisonous needles'."&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Zürich]], Latin ''[[Turicum (Zürich)|Turicum]]'', from a Gaulish personal name ''Tūros''
*[[Limmat]], from ''Lindomagos'' "lake-plain", originally the name of the plain formed by the [[Linth]] and [[Lake Zurich]].

====England (excluding Cornwall)====
Linguistic evidence for Celtic place-names in present-day England (part of the [[United Kingdom]]) can be found in names such as Leatherhead or Litchfield. In addition, evidence of Celtic populations can be found from those place-names including the Old English element ''[[walhaz|wealh]]'' "foreigner, stranger, [[Britons (Celtic people)|Briton]]". Such names are a minority, but are widespread across England. For example, a smattering of villages around the [[The Fens|Fenland]] town of [[Wisbech]] hint at this: [[West Walton]], [[Walsoken]], and the [[Walpole, Norfolk|Walpoles]] indicate the continued presence of an indigenous population, and Wisbech, [[King's Lynn]] and [[Chatteris]] retain Celtic topographical elements.

Some villages that exhibit "Tydd" in their name, e.g. [[Tydd St Giles]], may obtain that element from the Britonnic word for "small holding". Compare the Welsh ''tyddyn''.

A '''circuit''' ({{zh|c=道|p=dào}} or {{zh|c=路|p=lù}}) was a [[history of the administrative divisions of China before 1912|historical political division]] of [[China]] and is a historical and modern [[administrative divisions of Japan|administrative unit]] in [[Japan]]. The primary level of [[administrative divisions of Korea (disambiguation)|administrative division]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; of [[Korea]] under the [[Joseon]] and in modern [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]] employs the same [[Hanja|Chinese character]] as the Chinese and Japanese divisions but, because of its relatively greater importance, is usually translated as '''province''' instead.

{{See also|History of the administrative divisions of China}}

Circuits originated in China during the [[Han dynasty]], and were used as a lower tier administrative division, comparable to the  [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|county]] ({{zh|s=县|t=縣|p=xiàn}}, also translated as "districts"), but only to be used in areas in the fringes of the Empire, that were either primarily inhabited by non-Han Chinese peoples, or too geographically isolated from the rest of the Han centers of power. The system fell into disuse after the collapse of the [[Western Jin dynasty]]. {{cn|date=December 2015}}

The administrative division was revived in 627 when [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] made it the highest level administrative division, and subdivided China into ten circuits. These were originally meant to be purely geographic and not administrative.  [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] added a further five and slowly, the circuits strengthened their own power, until they became powerful regional forces that tore the country apart during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. During the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] dynasties, circuits were renamed from ''dao'' to ''lu'' ({{lang|zh|路}}), both of which literally mean "road" or "path". 

''Dao'' were revived during the [[Yuan dynasty]]. {{cn|date=December 2015}} Circuits were demoted to the second-level after the [[Yuan dynasty]] established provinces at the very top, and remained there for the next several centuries.{{cn|date=December 2015}} The Yuan dynasty also had ''lu'' (sometimes translated as "Route") but it was simply the Chinese word used for the Mongolian administrative unit, the ''cölge''. The Yuan ''lu'' had little to do with the circuits (''lu'') in Song and Jin dynasties and were closer in size to prefectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The A to Z of the Mongol World Empire|last=Buell|first=Paul D.|year=2003|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|isbn=978-0-8108-7578-4|pages=141, 188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], they were overseen by a {{nowrap|'''circuit intendant'''}} or {{nowrap|'''tao-tai'''}} ({{zh|c={{linktext|道臺}}|p=dàotái}}). The [[circuit intendant of Shanghai]] was particularly influential.

During the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] era, circuits still existed as high-level, though not top-level, administrative divisions such as Qiongya Circuit (now [[Hainan]] province). In 1928, all circuits were replaced with committees or simply abandoned. {{cn|date=December 2015}}

== Japan ==
During the [[Asuka period]] (AD 538–710), Japan was organized into five provinces and seven circuits, known as the [[Gokishichidō]] (5 ki 7 dō), as part of a legal and governmental system borrowed from the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Goki-shichidō''" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 255|page=255}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File].&lt;/ref&gt; Though these units did not survive as administrative structures beyond the [[Muromachi period]] (1336–1573), they did remain important geographical entities up until the 19th century. The seven circuits spread over the islands of [[Honshū]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Kyūshū]]:
* [[Tōkaidō (region)|Tōkaidō]] ({{lang|ja|東海道}}) "East Sea Circuit": 15&amp;nbsp;[[Provinces of Japan|provinces]] (''kuni'')
* [[Nankaidō]] ({{lang|ja|南海道}}) "South Sea Circuit": 6&amp;nbsp;provinces
* [[Saikaidō]] ({{lang|ja|西海道}}) "West Sea Circuit": 8&amp;nbsp;provinces
* [[Hokurikudō]] ({{lang|ja|北陸道}}) "North Land Circuit": 7&amp;nbsp;provinces
* [[San'indō]] ({{lang|ja|山陰道}}) "Shaded-side Circuit": 8&amp;nbsp;provinces
* [[San'yōdō]] ({{lang|ja|山陽道}}) "Sunny-side Circuit": 8&amp;nbsp;provinces
* [[Tōsandō]] ({{lang|ja|東山道}}) "East Mountain Circuit": 13&amp;nbsp;provinces

In the mid-19th century, the northern island of [[Ezo]] was settled, and renamed {{nihongo3|"North Sea Circuit"|北海道|[[Hokkaido|Hokkaidō]]}}. It is currently the only [[prefectures of Japan|prefecture of Japan]] named with the ''dō'' (circuit) suffix.

== Korea ==
Since the late 10th century, the ''do'' (“province”) has been the primary [[administrative division]] in [[Korea]].  See [[Eight Provinces of Korea|Eight Provinces]], [[Provinces of Korea]], [[Administrative divisions of South Korea#Do (Province)|Subdivisions of South Korea]] and [[Administrative divisions of North Korea#Provinces|Administrative divisions of North Korea]] for details.

[[File:Navigational rules types.JPG|thumb|Instruments used to plot a course on a nautical or aeronautical chart.]]

In [[navigation]], the '''course''' of a [[watercraft|vessel]] or [[aircraft]] is the [[cardinal direction]] in which the craft is to be steered. The course is to be distinguished from the ''[[Heading (navigation)|heading]]'', which is the [[Points of the compass|compass direction]] in which the craft's bow or nose is pointed.&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;

The difference between the course and heading, known as the ''drift'', is due to the motion of the underlying medium, the air or water, or other effects like skidding or slipping. The drift can be determined by the [[navigational triangle]].

== Course, track, route and heading ==
The line connecting the object's consecutive positions on the ground is referred to as the '''[[ground track]]'''. The ''track'' the object was intended to follow is called the '''route'''. For ships and aircraft, the ''route'' is represented by the [[Great circle|great circle line]] that connects the previous [[waypoint]] with the next waypoint. The responsibility of a navigator is to make the ''track'' coincide as much as possible with the ''route''. The direction of the ''route'' is called the '''route course'''. "Course" exceptionally, and arguably erroneously, may also refer to the ''route'', such as in a [[course deviation indicator]], in which case it no longer constitutes an angle but rather a line. The direction of the [[Great circle|great circle line]] that runs from the current position to the next waypoint is called the '''course to steer''', or the '''bearing''' to that waypoint. The '''tracking angle''' is the angle between the ''course to steer'' and the ''course''. The '''heading''' is the direction to which the "nose" of the object is pointing, its orientation.&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;

Directions (''course to steer'', ''course'', ''heading'' and ''route course'') are typically measured clockwise from north, either true or magnetic, in degrees from 0° to 359°, following compass convention (0° being north, 90° being east, etc.). In [[aviation]], north is usually expressed as 360° instead of 0°
&lt;ref name="Nolan2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Nolan|title=Fundamentals of Air Traffic Control|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6yhTiGC3ulcC&amp;pg=PA201|date=28 January 2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-4354-8272-7|page=201|quote=For example, a runway heading north would have a magnetic heading of 360°.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

. For land based vehicles (like cars), ''heading'' and ''course'' are typically identical, but for aircraft the action of [[wind]], and for vessels  the actions of [[wind]] and [[ocean current|current]] may cause the two to differ significantly.

== Relationship between true and magnetic direction ==
[[Image:Course (navigation).svg|upright=1|Heading and track (A to B)]]
* '''[[Navigation|Heading]]''' (2) is the angle between the direction in which the object's nose is pointing and a reference direction (e.g. true north (1)) (the heading of the ship shown in the image above is about 060°).&lt;ref&gt;To increase readability of the diagram, all possible influences were given as positive values, e.g. variation to the east, positive deviation, wind and current from [[port (nautical)|port side]]. The principle is the same regardless of the sign/direction of any of the components.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Any reading from a magnetic compass refers to ''compass north'' (4), which is supposed to contain a two-part ''compass error:''
:a) The Earth's magnetic field's north direction, or ''magnetic north'' (3), almost always differs from true north by [[magnetic variation]] (6), the local amount of which may be found in nautical or aeronautical charts,&lt;ref&gt;The "heading and track" diagram above shows a [[magnetic declination]] to the east, as is commonly encountered in most of the [[Pacific Ocean]], and a somewhat exaggerated (relative to most real-life examples) deviation (of about 10°).&lt;/ref&gt; and
:b) The vehicle's own magnetic field may influence the compass by so-called [[magnetic deviation]] (5). Deviation only depends on the vehicle's own magnetic field&lt;ref&gt;By conventional [[degaussing]], deviation could usually be kept below 10°, and [[fluxgate compass]]es can be degaussed to close to 0°.&lt;/ref&gt; and the heading, and therefore can be checked out and given as a ''deviation table'' or, graphically, as a [[Napier's diagram]].

* The ''compass heading'' (7) has to be corrected first for deviation (the "nearer" error), which yields the ''magnetic heading'' (8). Correcting this for variation yields ''true heading'' (2).
* In case of a [[crosswind]] (9), and/or [[tide|tidal]] or other current (10), the heading will not meet the desired target, as the vehicle will continuously drift sideways; it becomes necessary to point the heading away from the course to counteract these effects and make the track coincide with the [[great circle]].

An '''aircraft's heading''' is the direction that the aircraft's nose is pointing.

It is referenced by using either the [[magnetic compass]] or [[heading indicator]], two instruments that most aircraft have as standard. Using standard instrumentation, it is in reference to the local magnetic north direction. True heading is in relation to the lines of meridian (north–south lines). The units are degrees from north in a clockwise direction. North is 0°, east is 90°, south is 180°, and west is 270°.

Note that, due to wind forces, the direction of movement of the aircraft, or track, is not the same as the heading. The nose of the aircraft may be pointing due west, for example, but a strong northerly wind will change its track south of west. The angle between heading and track is known as the drift angle. Crab angle is the amount of correction an aircraft must be turned into the wind in order to maintain the desired course. It is opposite in direction to the drift angle and approximately equal in magnitude for small angles.

An aircraft can have instruments on board that show to the pilot the aircraft heading. The [[autopilot]] can be programmed to maintain either the aircraft heading or its course (when set in a proper mode and with correct navigational data inputs).

== Relationship between course and heading ==

The ''heading'' will differ from the ''course'' depending on (1) the forward speed (speed parallel to the ''heading'') of the vehicle in its medium (air for an aircraft, water for a vessel), (2) drift speed (speed [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] to the ''heading'') in its medium (only for vessels, especially for [[sail boat]]s at close [[points of sail]]), and (3) wind speed and wind direction (only for aircraft) or current speed and current direction (only for vessels). In the event of a [[headwind]] or [[tailwind]], ''heading'' and course in an aircraft are the same. For a ship at sea, if a current is running parallel to the ''heading'', then the ''course'' is the same as the ''heading''.

In an aircraft, to correct for the difference between ''heading'' and ''course'', a navigator uses the [[wind triangle]]. In the early days of navigation, wind speed was estimated by the drift observed and the plane was steered to correct for the wind influence. Contemporary navigational aids have simplified the problem of determining course to steer.

[[File:Danny Dorling in 2011.jpg|thumb|Danny Dorling in 2011]]
In September 2013 he became the [[Halford Mackinder Professor of Geography]], attached to [[St Peter's College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spc.ox.ac.uk/Staff/69/Staff.html?StaffId=354 St Peter's College website]&lt;/ref&gt; In his inaugural lecture he spoke about the increasing disparity between Britain's richest 1% and the rest. He said: "Income inequality has now reached a new maximum and, for the first time in a century, even those just below the richest 1% are beginning to suffer, to see their disposable income drop."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/04/education-system-polarises-people-economic-inequality ''The Guardian'' 4 February 2014: Is the British education system designed to polarise people?]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has mapped (mainly using [[cartogram]]s), analysed and commented upon [[UK demographic statistics]]. Many of his published papers, commentaries and reports are freely available on-line.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dannydorling.org/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 he started the Internet-based [http://archive.worldmapper.org/ Worldmapper] which now has about 700 world maps and spreadsheets of international statistics. He has been on radio, television and in newspaper articles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dannydorling.org/?page_id=2921&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

In February 2006, his work in human geography was described as  "rummaging around" in numbers, crunching his way through reams of raw data, building up an extraordinary picture of poverty and wealth in contemporary Britain.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' 8 February 2006 [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/08/socialexclusion.guardiansocietysupplement2 Interview: Danny Dorling]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, an editorial in ''[[The Guardian]]'' was entitled "In Praise of Danny Dorling".&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' 30 April 2010 [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/30/in-praise-of-danny-dorling?INTCMP=SRCH In Praise of Danny Dorling]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Terrestrial Reference System 1989''' ('''ETRS89''') is an [[ECEF]] (Earth-Centered,  Earth-Fixed) [[geodesy|geodetic]] [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian reference frame]], in which the [[Eurasian Plate]] as a whole is static. The [[coordinate]]s and [[map]]s in Europe based on ETRS89 are not subject to change due to the [[continental drift]]. 

The development of ETRS89 is related to the global [[International Terrestrial Reference System|ITRS]] [[geodetic datum]], in which the representation of the continental drift is balanced in such a way that the total apparent [[angular momentum]] of [[continental plate]]s is about 0.  ETRS89 was officially born at the 1990 [[Florence]] meeting of [[Regional Reference Frame Sub-Commission for Europe|EUREF]], following its Resolution 1, which recommends that the terrestrial reference system to be adopted by EUREF will be coincident with ITRS at the epoch 1989.0 and fixed to the stable part of the Eurasian Plate. According to the resolution, this system was named European Terrestrial Reference System 89 (ETRS89). Since then ETRS89 and ITRS diverge due to the continental drift at a speed about  2.5&amp;nbsp;cm per year. By the year 2000 the two coordinate systems differed by about 25&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/gps/osnetfreeservices/about/faqs_osnet.html#1 GPS and Positioning Services FAQ, Q1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415034024/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/gps/osnetfreeservices/about/faqs_osnet.html |date=2007-04-15 }}, UK Ordnance Survey, accessed 2007-11-25&lt;/ref&gt;

The 89 in its name does not refer to the year of solution (realization), but rather the year of initial definition, when ETRS89 was fully equivalent to ITRS. The solutions of ETRS89 correspond to the ITRS solutions. For each ITRS solution, a matching ETRS89 solution is being made. [http://etrs89.ensg.ign.fr/pub/ETRF2000.SSC ETRF2000], for example, is an ETRS89 solution, which corresponds to [http://itrf.ensg.ign.fr/ITRF_solutions/2000/results/ITRF2000_GPS.SSC.txt ITRF2000]. ETRS89 is realized by EUREF through the maintenance of the [[EUREF Permanent Network|EUREF Permanent Network (EPN)]] and continuous processing of the EPN data in a few processing centres. Users have access to ETRS89 via EPN data products and real-time streams of differential corrections from a set of public providers based on the EPN stations. 
The transformation from ETRS89 to ITRS is time-dependent and was formulated by C. Boucher and Z. Altamimi &lt;ref&gt;C. Boucher, Z. Altamimi. Specifications for reference frame fixing in the analysis of a EUREF GPS campaign.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only geodetic datum to be used for [[Cartography|mapping]] and [[surveying]] purposes in Europe.
It plays the same role for Europe as [[NAD-83]] for North America. (NAD-83 is a datum in which the [[North American Plate]] as a whole is static, and which is used for mapping and surveying in the US, Canada, and Mexico.) ETRS89 and NAD-83 are based on the [[GRS80]] [[reference ellipsoid|ellipsoid]]. [[WGS84]] originally used the GRS80 reference ellipsoid, but has undergone some minor refinements in later editions since its initial publication.

A '''finger lake''', also known as either a '''fjord lake''' or '''trough lake''', is "a narrow linear body of water occupying a [[Overdeepening|glacially overdeepened valley]] and sometimes impounded by a [[Terminal moraine|morainic dam]]."&lt;ref&gt;Hamblin and Carmack (1978), 885.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whittow (1984), 193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kotlyakov and Komarova (2007), 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Where one end of a finger lake is drowned by the sea, it becomes a [[fjord]] or [[sea-loch]].

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]], the invading [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] established a variety of [[puppet government]]s such as the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1937–1940)|Provisional Government of China]] and the [[Reformed Government of China]] which used the [[Five Races Under One Union]] [[flag]] even though the legitimate [[Nationalist Government|Chinese Government]] had switched to the current day modern [[flag of the Republic of China]].

When the [[Wang Jingwei regime]] was established on 30 March 1940 in [[Nanjing]], [[Wang Jingwei]] was slated to take over the previous Japanese-installed governments and [[centralize]] the [[Chinese Nationalists]] under what they claimed to be the legitimate successor to the [[Republic of China (1912-49)|Republic of China]] he demanded to use the modern flag as a means to challenge the authority of the [[Chongqing]] government under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and position himself as the rightful successor to [[Sun Yat-sen]].

[[File:Wang and Nazis.jpg|thumb|240px|right|The flag used indoors next to the [[flag of Nazi Germany]].]]However, the Japanese preferred the Five-Colored [[Five Races Under One Union|Five Races Under One Union flag]]. As a compromise, the Japanese suggested adding a triangular yellow [[Pennon|pennant]] on top with the slogan "Peace, Anti-Communism, National Construction" (和平反共建國, Hépíng fǎn'gòng jiàn guó) in black, but this was rejected by Wang. In the end, Wang and the Japanese agreed that the yellow banner was to be used outdoors only, until 1943 when the banner was abandoned, leaving two rival governments with the same flag, each claiming to be the legitimate government of China.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/cn_j_nj2.html crwflags article on the Nanjing Nationalist Government -]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were multiple variants of the pendent used by the Wang Jingwei Government, these variants were based on regional choice.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

'''Kataldhar''' is the name of a big [[waterfall]] near [[Lonavla]] in [[Pune district]] in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Maharashtra]]. This waterfall is not so famous because to reach to the valley is somewhat difficult and need some experience of basic [[trekking]] before exploring this place.  Water is not available there for the whole year, but a good amount of water falls during the [[monsoon]] season.  Though it is difficult to reach to the valley there is a heaven at the end of the fall. 

Kataldhar Waterfall is located near [[Rajmachi|Rajmachi Fort]]. On the way of Rajmachi Trekking route you will find 3 mango trees. This is only one option to reach Kataldhar Waterfall. From this point you can descend the Ulhas valley through dense forest. After reaching at Kataldhar Waterfall you will see one eye shape cave where 100 people easily accommodate in that cave. From this cave you will see Rajmachi Fort (Srivardhan Fort Balekilla).

'''Landscape Ontario''' Horticultural Trades Association was founded in 1973 by combining three separate horticultural associations into one.   The original organizations were: Ontario Garden Maintenance and Landscape Association, Ontario Landscape Contractors Association and Ontario Nurseryman's Association.

Landscape Ontario serves 10 related sectors of [[horticulture]] and has more than 2,000 member companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horttrades.com/what-is-lo What is LO?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The association is governed by an elected Provincial Board of Directors.

==Chapters==
Landscape Ontario's membership is organized by a chapter system. 

* Durham
* Georgian Lakelands
* Golden Horseshoe
* London
* Ottawa
* Toronto
* Upper Canada
* Waterloo
* Windsor

==Trade Shows==
Landscape Ontario started its January trade show Congress in 1973.  The show is now in the top five horticultural shows in North America with over {{convert|8|acre|m2}} of exhibits plus 12,500 trade visitors.

In 2003 a secondary fall buying show was created called Garden Expo.  Over the years this show has merged with other like minded shows like the National Hardware Show and continually partners up with Flowers Canada which changed the shows name to Garden and Floral Expo.  To alleviate confusion, the show is now known as Landscape Ontario's Expo.

==Consumer Shows==
Landscape Ontario and the Garden Club of Toronto founded Canada Blooms in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadablooms.com/html/history-of-canada-blooms.html History of Canada Blooms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413151201/http://www.canadablooms.com/html/history-of-canada-blooms.html |date=2010-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[statue]] of the plant has been erected in [[Golden Bauhinia Square]] in Hong Kong. Although the flowers are bright pinkish purple in colour, they are depicted in white on the Flag of Hong Kong.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20100">'''{{Main|List of invasive species}}'''

This is a '''list of [[invasive species]] in Asia'''. A species is regarded as invasive if it has been introduced by human action to a location, area, or region where it did not previously occur naturally (i.e., is not a [[native species]]), becomes capable of establishing a breeding population in the new location without further intervention by humans, and becomes a ''pest'' in the new location, directly threatening agriculture and/or the local [[biodiversity]].

The term '''invasive species''' refers to a subset of those species defined as [[introduced species]]. If a species has been introduced but remains local, and is not problematic to agriculture or to the local biodiversity, then it cannot be considered to be an invasive species and does not belong on this list.

[[File:Malta Marsamxett.png|thumb|Map of Marsamxett]]

'''Marsamxett Harbour''' ({{IPA-mt|mɐr.sɐmˈʃɛt}}), historically also referred to as '''Marsamuscetto''', is a [[natural harbour]] on the island of [[Malta]]. It is located to the north of the larger [[Grand Harbour]]. The harbour is generally more dedicated to leisure use than the Grand Harbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Other Ports|url=http://www.transport.gov.mt/ports-marinas/ports-in-malta/other-ports|website=Transport Malta|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The harbour mouth faces north east and is bounded to the north by Dragut Point and [[Tigné Point]]. Its northwest shore is made up of the towns of [[Sliema]], [[Gżira]] and [[Ta' Xbiex]]. The harbour then extends inland to [[Pietà, Malta|Pietà]] and [[Msida]]. Off Gżira lies [[Manoel Island]], now connected to the mainland by a bridge. The south eastern shore of the harbour is formed by the Sciberras peninsula, which is largely covered by the town of [[Floriana]] and the city of [[Valletta]]. At its tip lies the 16th century [[Fort Saint Elmo]]. The Sciberras peninsula divides Marsamxett from the larger parallel natural harbour, [[Grand Harbour]].{{cn|date=October 2017}}

Along its partner the [[Grand Harbour]], Marsamxett lies at the centre of gently rising ground. Development has grown up all around the twin harbours and up the slopes so that the whole bowl is effectively one large [[conurbation]]. Much of Malta's population lives within a three kilometer radius of Floriana. This is now one of the most densely populated areas in Europe. The harbours and the surrounding areas make up Malta's [[Districts of Malta#Northern Harbour District|Northern]] and [[Districts of Malta#Southern Harbour District|Southern Harbour District]]s. Together, these districts contain 27 of 68 [[Local councils of Malta|local councils]]. They have a population of 213,722 which make up over 47% of the total population of the Maltese islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estimated Population by Locality 31st March, 2013|url=http://www.lc.gov.mt/mediacenter/PDFs/1_Population%2031-3-13.pdf|publisher=Malta Government Gazette 19,094|accessdate=21 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714184236/http://www.lc.gov.mt/mediacenter/PDFs/1_Population%2031-3-13.pdf|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{moresources|section|date=October 2017}}
In 1551, [[Invasion of Gozo (1551)#Malta|Ottomans landed at Marsamxett]] and marched upon the Grand Harbour, but did not attack as they found strong defences built by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]]. This skirmish was followed by an unsuccessful attack against [[Mdina]], and successful [[Invasion of Gozo (1551)|sacking of Gozo]] and [[Siege of Tripoli (1551)|conquest of Tripoli]]. After this attack, [[Fort Saint Elmo]] was built to guard both Marsamxett and the Grand Harbour.

A much larger Ottoman invasion came in 1565, in the [[Great Siege of Malta]]. During the siege, the Ottoman fleet was based at Marsamxett, and cannons were stationed at Tigné Point in order to bombard Fort Saint Elmo. During the attack, the Ottoman admiral [[Dragut]] was killed by stray gunfire. The siege was eventually lifted and the Order and the Maltese emerged victorious. A new city was constructed on the Sciberras Peninsula, and was named [[Valletta]] after the Grandmaster who commissioned it. The suburb of [[Floriana]] was later built outside the city, and it has now developed into a town in its own right.

In 1592, a wooden quarantine hospital was built on [[Manoel Island]], then known as ''l'Isola del Vescovo''. It was dismantled a year later, but a permanent [[Lazzaretto of Manoel Island|Lazzaretto]] was built in its place in 1643, which was improved a number of times until its closure in 1929. Between 1723-33, [[Fort Manoel]] was built on Manoel Island, while [[Fort Tigné]] was built on [[Tigné Point]] in 1793. British barracks were also built on Tigné Point, but these have since been demolished.

During [[World War II]], the British used Marsamxett, particularly Manoel Island, as a submarine base. The island was a [[stone frigate]], referred to as HMS ''Talbot'' or HMS ''Phœnicia''. Fort Manoel saw use once again, and it was bombarded by Luftwaffe bombers causing much destruction.

In 1977, the [[Maritime Squadron of the Armed Forces of Malta|1st (Maritime) Battery of the Armed Forces of Malta]] moved its base to [[Hay Wharf]] in Marsamxett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maritime Squadron Armed Forces of Malta|url=http://steno.webs.com/112/afm/maritime.htm|website=steno.webs.com|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sliema, Gżira, and Ta' Xbiex on the northern end of the harbour have seen a lot of development in recent years. Marsamxett Harbour is now mainly used for smaller watercraft when compared to Grand Harbour. There are a number of yacht marinas including at Msida and Manoel Island, a yacht yard, as well as tourist cruise boats which operate from Sliema.

On 10 September 2006, during the Maltese round of the [[Aero GP]] series, a mid-air collision between two planes above the harbour caused the death of one of the pilots, [[Gabor Varga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stunt pilot dies in crash over Marsamxett|url=http://www.maltamedia.com/news/2005/ln/article_11464.shtml|accessdate=21 November 2014|work=MaltaMedia News|date=10 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "'''mesoplates'''" has been applied in two different contexts within [[geology]] and [[geophysics]]. The first is applicable to much of the [[Earth]]'s [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], and the second to distinct layering within the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]].

==Mantle==

{{Empty section|date=February 2018}}

==[[Rheological]] Model== 
In 1977 researchers M. Kumazawa and Y. Fukao &lt;ref&gt;Kumazawa, M., and Fukao, Y., 1977, Dual plate tectonics model, in, High-Pressure Research: Applications in Geophysics, Manghani, M.H., and Akimoto, S-I., editors, High-Pressure Research; Applications in Geophysics, Academic Press, ISBN 970-0-12-468750-9, p. 127. (Online version, http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780124687509 posted November 17, 2013.)&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the term "mesoplate" in the context of what they termed a "Dual Plate Tectonic Model." Their rationale is a postulated low-velocity zone near and above the 650&amp;nbsp;km discontinuity with additional properties including local low melitng temperature, active chemical migration and fractionation, and low-viscosity. They further write,

"These features lead to a concept of dual plate tectonics models. The layer between the 200- and 550-km depths is sandwiched between two relatively soft layers (upper and lower LVZs) and is expected to behave as a rigid plate (mesoplate)."

==Kinematic Model==

From a kinematic perspective, the concept of "'''mesoplates'''" was applied as a [[heuristic]] for characterizing the motion of [[lithospheric]] [[List of tectonic plates|plates]] relative to the sublithospheric source region of [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] [[volcanism]] (Pilger, 2003), or more simply: kinematically rigid layers within the mesosphere, beneath one or more plates.&lt;ref&gt;Rex H. Pilger (14 March 2013). Geokinematics: Prelude to Geodynamics. Springer Science &amp; Business Media. pp. 203–. {{ISBN|978-3-662-07439-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. Jason Morgan]] (1972), originally suggested that hotspots (inferred by [[J. Tuzo Wilson]]) beneath such active volcanic regions as [[Hawaii#Location.2C topography.2C and geology|Hawaii]] and [[Iceland]] form a fixed "absolute" frame of reference for the motion of the overlying plates. However, the existence of a globally fixed reference frame for island-[[seamount]] chains and aseismic ridges ("traces") that are inferred to have originated from hotspots was quickly discounted by the primitive plate reconstructions available in the mid-1970s (Molnar and Atwater, 1973). Further, [[paleomagnetic]] measurements imply that hotspots have moved relative to the [[poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic pole]]s of the Earth (the magnetic poles are further inferred to correspond with the rotational poles of the planet when averaged over thousands of years). Aside: the term "hotspot" is used herein without any genetic implications. The term "melting spot" might well be more applicable.

===Development of the kinematic concept===
As [[plate reconstruction]]s have improved over the succeeding three decades since Morgan's original contribution, it is become apparent that the hotspots beneath the central North and South [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s may form one, distinct [[frame of reference]], while those underlying the plates beneath the [[Pacific Ocean]] form a separate reference frame. For convenience, the hotspots beneath the Pacific Ocean are referred to as the "Hawaiian set" after [[Hawaiian hotspot|Hawaii]], while those beneath much of the Atlantic and Indian Ocean are called the "Tristan set" after the island of [[Tristan da Cunha]] (the [[Tristan hotspot]]), one of the principal inferred hotspots of the set. Within a single hotspot set, the traces tied to their originating hotspot can be fit by plate reconstructions which imply only minor relative motion among the hotspots for perhaps the past 130 m.y. (million years) for the Tristan set and 80 m.y. for the Hawaiian set. However, the two hotspot sets are inconsistent with the hypothesis of a single hotspot reference frame; distinct motion between the two sets is apparent between 80 and 30 Ma (m.y. before Present; e.g., Raymond, et al., 2000).

It is important to acknowledge that [[radiometric dating]] of [[volcanism]] along hotspot traces may or may not accurately and precisely constrain the position of the plate above the underlying hotspot at the analytically produced age. However, reconstruction models for the Hawaiian set are constrained in age by the hotspot beneath [[Easter Island]] and its traces on the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]] and [[Nazca Plate|Nazca plates]] between approximately 50 and 30 Ma, as the hotspot was beneath the [[spreading center]] during that time interval, and resulting relative plate reconstructions constrain motion of the plates relative to the hotspot. Prior to 50 Ma and since 30 Ma, reconstructions can be determined that fit virtually all existing Hawaiian set traces; the actual ages have the greatest uncertainty. Similarly, plate reconstructions relative to the Tristan set are best constrained in age by relative plate reconstructions, a fortuitous consequence of spherical plate tectonics of three or more plates.

Lithospheric plates are recognized in terms of their lack of internal deformation. Thus two points on the same plate will not move relative to one another, even if the plate moves relative to another plate (or relative to the Earth's rotational poles). Plates are not explicitly defined in terms of their mechanical properties. In a sense, then, "plates" are a heuristic—rather like fitting a straight line through a set of points without a clear functional relationship. Analogously, the term "mesoplate" was introduced. Since the hotspots of the Hawaiian set appear to form a frame of reference (like points on a lithospheric plate, they don't appear to be moving at a very great rate relative to one another), the hotspots and that part of the upper mantle in which they are embedded is termed the "Hawaiian mesoplate". The "Tristan mesoplate" is similarly defined. A third mesoplate, "Icelandic", is inferred to underlie the northernmost Atlantic Ocean, the [[Arctic Ocean]], much of Eurasia to the north of the Alps and Himalayas; since the [[Iceland hotspot]] trace is not consistent with either the Hawaiian or Tristan set.

Additional evidence for mesoplates comes from observations that intraplate stresses in stable continental interiors of North America and Africa are consistent with plate motions in the Tristan hotspot frame. This observation was first made for contemporary stresses (the maximum horizontal principal compressive stress&amp;nbsp;– sigma-hx); and also appears to hold for [[paleostress]] indicators between approximately 100 and 20 Ma (Pilger, 2003). This observation implies that the sublithospheric mantle over which the plates are moving comprises the same reference frame in which the hotspots are embedded.

The mesoplate heuristic is very much a hypothetical construct. Several observations could discount it. It is conceivable that a missing plate boundary between the plates beneath the Pacific and those beneath the Atlantic and Indian Oceans might be hidden and responsible for the discrepancy between the two hotspot sets. However, progressive study of the most likely region for such a boundary has failed to find it.

The origin of hotspots, whether from deep [[mantle plumes]], mid-mantle melting anomalies, or intraplate fractures, is constrained somewhat by the mesoplate hypothesis. The principal alternative models for the origin of hotspot traces, propagating fractures, are still actively advocated by many workers (see [http://www.mantleplumes.org mantleplumes.org]). Such a model does not explicitly recognize sublithospheric reference frames. However, it cannot completely explain all of the features of the most familiar hotspot traces ([http://www.gsajournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-pdf&amp;doi=10.1130/B25713.1 Pilger, 2007]).

The mantle plume hypothesis for the origin of hotspots need not be inconsistent with mesoplates. However, it would need to be modified to recognize that the lack of motion between hotspots represents a kind of "embedding" of the "plume" in the upper mantle (shallow mesosphere) of the Earth. One of Morgan's rationales for plumes was the existence of an "absolute motion" reference frame. Numerical modeling now indicates that such a reference frame would be unlikely in the context of plume convection.

If continued research were to demonstrate the continued applicability of the mesoplate hypothesis, it would have important implications for the nature of [[mantle convection|convection]] in the upper mantle: Convective motion beneath plates is almost entirely vertical within individual mesoplates; lateral motion in the mantle would be confined to mesoplate boundaries and to greater depths.

==Crustal Model==

Phipps &lt;ref&gt;Phipps, S. P., 1992, Crustal mesoplate tectonics: deformation in continental interiors by basement detachment, in Basement Tectonics, 7, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; coined the term "crustal mesoplate tectonics" as applied to brittle crust detached from inferred more ductile lower crust. The analogy between lithoplate tectonics and crustal deformation engaging both brittle and ductile components leads to the concept of crustal mesoplates.

==Origin of the term==

“Mesoplates” is a combination and contraction of two terms: “mesosphere”, as applied to the solid [[earth]], and “[[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]”.

==Mesosphere (solid earth)==

“[[Mesosphere (mantle)|Mesosphere]]” (not to be confused with [[mesosphere]], a layer of the [[atmosphere]]) is derived from “mesospheric shell”, coined by [[Reginald Aldworth Daly]], a [[Harvard University]] [[geology]] professor. In the pre-[[plate tectonics]] era, Daly (1940) inferred three [[Sphere|spherical]] layers comprise the outer [[Earth]]: [[lithosphere]] (including the [[Crust (geology)|crust]]), [[asthenosphere]], and mesospheric shell. Daly’s hypothetical depths to the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary ranged from 80 to 100&amp;nbsp;km and the top of the mesospheric shell (base of the asthenosphere) from 200 to 480&amp;nbsp;km. Thus, Daly’s asthenosphere was inferred to be 120 to 400&amp;nbsp;km thick. According to Daly, the base of the solid earth mesosphere could extend to the base of the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] (and, thus, to the top of the [[Structure of the Earth#Core|core]]).

Isacks, Oliver, and Sykes (1968) applied lithosphere and asthenosphere to their conception to the “New Global Tectonics” or what subsequently became known as [[plate tectonics]]. In their conception, the base of the asthenosphere extended as deep as the deepest (650–700&amp;nbsp;km) [[earthquake]]s in the [[Wadati–Benioff zone|inclined seismic zones]] where descending [[Lithosphere|lithospheric plates]] penetrate the upper mantle.

==Lithospheric (tectonic) plate (or lithoplate)==

The (spherical) [[Lithosphere|lithospheric plates]] of [[plate tectonics]] are so defined because they behave in a [[Kinematics|kinematically]] [[rigid body|rigid]] manner. That is, any three points on the same plate do not move relative to one another, while the plate itself (and all points it contains) may move relative to other plates or other internal reference frames (e.g., the earth’s spin axis or [[geomagnetic pole]]s). In other words, ideal lithospheric plates do not deform internally as they move.

A “mesoplate”, then behaves like lithospheric plates: empirical evidence (discussed above) indicates groups of melting anomalies ([[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]) embedded in the shallow mesosphere do not move relative to one another, but collectively move relative to other hotspot groups and relative to overlying lithospheric plates.

'''Microponics ''' is the [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] integration of fish, plants and micro-livestock in a semi-controlled environment. The term was adopted by Australian urban farmer, Gary Donaldson, in 2008, to describe his integrated backyard food production concept. While microponics was also the name given to an obscure grafting method used in hydroponics, Donaldson's use of the term was derived from the integration of micro-livestock (and micro-farming) and the production of fish and plants - [[aquaponics]].

==History==
Microponics has its roots in the integrated aquaculture work undertaken by the [[New Alchemy Institute]] during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The New Alchemists had developed useful food production models based on the integration of fish, plants, ducks, rabbits and other organisms - all of which were housed in their solar and wind-powered Cape Cod Ark bio-shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Wm McLarney and John Todd (1974). "Walton Two: A Compleat Guide to Backyard Fish Farming", ''The Journal of the New Alchemists No. 2'', pp 79-115 [http://www.nature.my.cape.com/greencenter/aquaculture.html Green Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated aquaculture, in which the by-products (waste) of one species are converted to become the feedstock (food, fertilizer, etc.) of another species, struck an immediate chord with Donaldson when he was first introduced to it in the mid-1970s. His goal was to develop a backyard food production regime that would enable the average householder to grow their own clean fresh food through the application of modest skills and appropriate technology. He reasoned that the one thing that all plant and animal species had in common was a need for water so it seemed logical that aquaculture should become a cornerstone of any integrated backyard food production system. 

Once the New Alchemists had reconnected him with the notion of integration (which is largely traditional mixed farming with an appropriate technology twist), Donaldson still grappled with the issue of scale. At just under 30 metres long and 6 metres high, the Ark was rather too large for the average backyard. 

Notwithstanding the innovative approach of the New Alchemists, translation of their work into an Australian context back in the 1970s was also hindered by the lack of information about the culture of Australian fish species. In the ensuing twenty years, [[aquaculture]] in Australia came of age and local researchers identified a number of suitable freshwater aquaculture species. Since 2007, Gary Donaldson has satisfied himself that limited quantities (in a backyard context) of Australian freshwater fish could be successfully grown out in as little as 600 litres of water. 

Integrated aquaculture was also the precursor to aquaponics (the integration of recirculating aquaculture and hydroponics) which, by the mid-2000s, was beginning to gain international momentum. Gary Donaldson found the notion of aquaponics too limiting and he continued to promote a more holistic approach to small-scale food production through the inclusion of micro-livestock. Aquaponics is, by definition, the combination of recirculating aquaculture and hydroponics for the production of fish and plants, however, microponics suggests that recirculating aquaculture can be advantageously integrated with virtually any plant growing system. The principal issue surrounding aquaponics is (like most aquaculture) its reliance on fishmeal and oil from wild catch marine species. The greater bio-diversity inherent in microponics offers the opportunity to reduce or even eliminate this dependency.

===Integrations within microponics===
The integrations embodied within microponics include:

* [[Fish]] and [[crustacean]]s
* [[Vegetable]]s, [[herb]]s and [[fruit]]
* [[Chicken]]s for [[meat]] and [[Egg (food)|egg]]s
* [[Japanese quail]]
* [[Rabbit]]s and other micro-livestock&lt;ref&gt;[[Appropedia:Original:Micro-livestock: Little-known Small Animals with a Promising Economic Future]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Muscovy duck|Muscovies]]
* [[Geese]] and other waterfowl
* Live animal protein - [[worm]]s, [[black soldier fly]] larvae, [[mealworm]]s
* Fodder plants - including [[duckweed]]
* [[Snail]]s

Given its emphasis on backyard food production, microponics tends to focus on smaller micro-livestock species but, where space and local planning laws permit, the concept can be expanded to include traditional species such as pigs, goats, sheep and even micro-cattle breeds like the [[Dexter cattle|Dexter]].

==Advantages==
The advantages of microponics food production systems include:

* Empowerment of families to produce their own clean, fresh food. 
* Conservation through water reuse and recycling.
* Organic fertilization of plants with natural fish emulsion.
* Efficient use of space through Its small footprint.
* Reduced reliance on purchased livestock rations.
* Its value as a learning resource for students of all ages.

==Disadvantages==
Some disadvantages with microponics are:

* Initial expense for housing, tank, plumbing, pumps, and grow beds.
* The infinite number of ways in which a system can be configured lends itself to varying results, conflicting research, and successes or failures.
* In heavily urbanised environments, a lack of space or local regulations might limit certain possible integrations.

The '''Mourdi Depression''' is a prominent desert [[Depression (geology)|depression]] of northeastern [[Chad]]. It lies adjacent to the [[Ennedi Plateau]].{{sfn|Shao|2008|p=33}} The cleft lies "between the Erdi plateau and the eastern slopes of Ennedi, and the mouth of the Wadi Guroguro."{{sfn|Kelly|2009|p=64}} The depression is characterized by a rocky valley, about {{convert|30|mi}} wide from north to south, sloping from an altitude of about {{convert|1800|ft}} down towards the west to [[Djourab Depression |Djourab]].{{sfn|Bartlett|1942|p=14}}

==Geography==
The Mourdi Depression lies along a trading route from [[Abéché]] to [[Kurfa]]; this route passes [[Tiné]], then veers north to [[Bao, Chad|Bao]], before passing through the Mourdi Depression and [[Erdi Ma]].{{sfn|Bollig|Schnegg|Wotzka|2013|p=426}} The Mourdi Depression is also along a fisherman's route for reaching the northeast of [[Lake Chad]] by traveling through the Erdi Plateau and Ennedi gap via the depression.{{sfn|Lévêque|1997|p=103}} The Wadi N'kaola in situated within the Mourdi Depression,{{sfn|Heseltine|1960|p=142}} and the nearest major town is [[Fada, Chad|Fada]] to the southwest.

'''The''' '''Pacific Coast Ranges''' (officially gazetted as the '''Pacific Mountain System'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/metadata/usgswrd/XML/physio.xml ''Physiographic regions of the United States'', USGS]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United States]] but referred to as the Pacific Coast Ranges),&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=V2d12iZkgOwC&amp;pg=PA361 Merriam-Webster's collegiate encyclopedia]'', page 361 (Merriam-Webster, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; are the series of [[mountain range]]s that stretch along the West Coast of [[North America]] from [[Alaska]] south to Northern and Central [[Mexico]].

The Pacific Coast Ranges are part of the [[North American Cordillera]] (sometimes known as the Western Cordillera, or in [[Canada]], as the Pacific Cordillera and/or the Canadian Cordillera), which includes the [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Columbia Mountains]], [[Interior Mountains]], the [[Interior Plateau]], [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada Mountains]], the [[:Category:Mountain ranges of the Great Basin|Great Basin mountain ranges]], and other ranges and various plateaus and basins.

The '''Pacific Coast Ranges''' designation, however, only applies to the Western System of the Western Cordillera,&lt;ref name="S. Holland, 1976"&gt;S. Holland, ''Landforms of British Columbia'', BC Govt. 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; which comprises the [[Saint Elias Mountains]], [[Coast Mountains]], [[Insular Mountains]], [[Olympic Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]], [[Oregon Coast Range]], [[California Coast Ranges]], [[Transverse Ranges]], [[Peninsular Ranges]], and the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]].

==Other uses==
The term ''Coast Range'' is not  used by the [[United States Geological Survey]] to refer only to the ranges east from the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] in Washington to the California-Mexico border; and only the ranges west of [[Puget Sound]], the [[Willamette Valley]], the [[Sacramento Valley|Sacramento]] and [[San Joaquin Valley|San Joaquin]] valleys or '[[California Central Valley]]' ''(thereby excluding the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Ranges)'', and the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]] [[High Desert (California)|''(High)'']] and [[Sonoran Desert|Sonoran]] [[Low Desert|''(Low)'']] Deserts.&lt;ref&gt;
  {{cite gnis
  | id = 252293
  | name = Coast Ranges 
  | accessdate = 2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
i.e. the [[Pacific Border province]].  The same term is used informally in Canada to refer to the [[Coast Mountains]] and adjoining inland ranges such as the [[Hazelton Mountains]], and sometimes also the Saint Elias Mountains.

==Geography==
The character of the ranges varies considerably, from the record-setting [[tidewater glacier]]s in the ranges of Alaska, to the rugged Central and [[Southern California]] ranges, the [[Transverse Ranges]] and [[Peninsular Ranges]], in the [[California chaparral and woodlands|chaparral and woodlands]] ecoregion with [[California oak woodland|Oak Woodland]], [[Chaparral]] shrub forest or [[Coastal sage scrub]]-covering them. The coastline is often dropping steeply into the sea with photogenic views.  Along the [[British Columbia]] and Alaska coast, the mountains intermix with the sea in a complex maze of [[fjords]], with thousands of islands. Off the Southern California coast the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] [[archipelago]] of the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] extends for {{convert|160|mi|km}}.

There are [[coastal plains]] at the mouths of rivers that have punched through the mountains spreading sediments, most notably at the [[Copper River (Alaska)|Copper River]] in Alaska, the [[Fraser River]] in British Columbia, and the [[Columbia River]] between Washington and Oregon. In California: the [[Sacramento River|Sacramento]] and [[San Joaquin River|San Joaquin]] Rivers' [[San Francisco Bay]], the [[Santa Clara River (California)|Santa Clara River's]] [[Oxnard Plain]] ''(home to some of the most fertile soil in the world),'' the Los Angeles, San Gabriel, and Santa Ana Rivers' [[Los Angeles Basin]] - a coastal sediment-filled plain between the peninsular and transverse ranges with sediment in the basin up to 6 miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) deep, and the San Diego River's [[Mission Bay, San Diego, California|Mission Bay]].

From the vicinity of San Francisco Bay north, it is common in winter for cool unstable air masses from the [[Gulf of Alaska]] to make landfall in one of the Coast Ranges, resulting in heavy [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], both as [[rain]] and [[snow]], especially on their western slopes. The same Winter weather occurs with less frequency and precipitation in Southern California, with the mountains' western faces and peaks causing an eastward [[rainshadow]] that produces the arid [[Desert Region of California|desert regions]].

Omitted from the list below, but often included is the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], a major mountain range of eastern California that is separated by the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] over much of its length from the California Coast Ranges and the Transverse Ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
On the West coast of North America, the coast ranges and the coastal plain form the margin. Most of the land is made of [[terrane]]s that have been [[Accretion (geology)|accreted]] onto the margin. In the north, the insular belt is an accreted terrane, forming the margin. This belt extends from the [[Wrangellia Terrane]] in Alaska to the Chilliwack group of Canada.&lt;ref name = Townsend2002&gt;{{cite web|title = Northwest Origins|last = Townsend|first = Catherine|last2 = Figge|first2 = John|publisher = The Burke Museum|date = 2002|url = http://www.burkemuseum.org/static/geo_history_wa/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rupture in [[Rodinia]] 750 million years ago formed a passive margin in the eastern Pacific Northwest. The breakup of [[Pangea]] 200 million years ago began the westward movement of the North American plate, creating an active margin on the western continent. As the continent drifted West, terranes were accreted onto the west coast.&lt;ref name = Townsend2002/&gt; The timing of the accretion of the insular belt is uncertain, although the closure did not occur until at least 115 million years ago.&lt;ref name = Townsend2002/&gt; Other [[Mesozoic]] terranes that accreted onto the continent include the [[Klamath Mountains]], the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and the Guerrero super-terrane of western Mexico.&lt;ref name=Dickinson2004&gt;{{cite journal|title = Evolution of the North American Cordillera|last = Dickinson|first = William|journal = Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|date = 2004|volume = 32|pages = 13–45|url = http://www.geo.arizona.edu/tectonics/Ducea/teaching/Dickinson2004.pdf|accessdate = 9 April 2013|doi = 10.1146/annurev.earth.32.101802.120257|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140104204050/http://www.geo.arizona.edu/tectonics/Ducea/teaching/Dickinson2004.pdf|archivedate = 4 January 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 80 to 90 million years ago the subducting [[Farallon plate]] split and formed the [[Kula Plate]] to the North. This formed an area in what is now Northern California, where the plates converged forming a [[Mélange]]. North of this was the [[Olympic-Wallowa Lineament#Columbia Embayment and KBML|Columbia Embayment]], where the continental margin was east of the surrounding areas.&lt;ref name = Townsend2002/&gt; Many of the major [[batholith]]s date from the late [[Cretaceous]].&lt;ref name = Dickinson2004/&gt; As the [[Laramide Orogeny]] ended around 48 million years ago, the accretion of the [[Siletzia]] terrane began in the Pacific Northwest. This began the volcanic activity in the [[Cascadia subduction zone]], forming the modern [[Cascade Range]], and lasted into the [[Miocene]]. Events here may relate to the [[Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up|ignimbrite flare-up]] of the southern [[Basin and Range Province|Basin and Range]].&lt;ref name = Humphreys2009&gt;{{cite journal|title = Relation of flat subduction to magmatism and deformation in the Western United States|last = Humphreys|first = Eugene|publisher = GSA|date = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As extension in the Basin and Range Province slowed by a change in [[North American Plate]] movement circa 7 to 8 Million years ago, rifting began on the [[Gulf of California]].&lt;ref name = Humphreys2009/&gt;

Although many of the ranges do share a common geologic history, the Pacific Coast Ranges province is not defined by geology, but rather by geography. Many of the various ranges are composed of distinct forms of rock from many different periods of geological time from the [[Precambrian]] in parts of the [[Little San Bernardino Mountains]] to 10,000-year-old rock in the [[Cascade Range]]. For one example, the [[Peninsular Ranges]], composed of Mesozoic batholitic rock, are geologically extremely different from the [[San Bernardino Mountains]], composed of a mix of Precambrian metamorphic rock and Cenozoic sedimentary rock. However, both are considered part of the Pacific Coast Ranges due to their proximity and similar economic and social impact on surrounding communities.

Hiding this for now as it's an inaccurate reference; Bivouac is misusing the term "Pacific Cordillera", which in regular geographic definitions means the WHOLE Western Cordillera, not just the Pacific Coast Ranges/Pacific mountain system subdivision of it

[[image:PlagePompierreCocotiers.JPG|thumb|Coconut trees on Pompierre]]
The '''Plage de Pompierre''' is a beach of [[Terre-de-Haut]], one of two islands in the archipelago of the [[Îles des Saintes]] in the [[French Antilles]]. It is 800 metres long, and overlooks  Pompierre Bay on the northeast coast of the island, and is protected from the trade winds by the presence of an islet. It is the most sought after by tourists and is planted with coconut trees.

The Bay has been classified as a natural site under the terms of the [[:fr:Loi ayant pour objet de réorganiser la protection des monuments naturels et des sites de caractère artistique, historique, scientifique, légendaire ou pittoresque|so-called Law of 2 May 1930]]. Motor boats and sailing boats are strictly prohibited from entering or anchoring in it.

A region is governed by a directly [[Elections in Morocco|elected]] regional council. The president of the council is responsible for carrying out the council's decisions. Prior to the [[Moroccan constitutional referendum, 2011|2011 constitutional reforms]], this was the responsibility of the [[Wali]], the representative of the central government appointed by the King, who now plays a supporting role in the administration of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://portal.cor.europa.eu/arlem/Documents/Morocco%20-%20Fact%20Sheet%20No%201%20FR_8%20May%202014.pdf |title=Maroc: Fiche technique |language=fr |publisher=[[ARLEM]] |year=2014 |accessdate=23 October 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024091449/https://portal.cor.europa.eu/arlem/Documents/Morocco%20-%20Fact%20Sheet%20No%201%20FR_8%20May%202014.pdf |archivedate=24 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entirety of [[Oued Ed-Dahab-Lagouira]] (1), the vast majority of [[Laâyoune-Boujdour-Sakia El Hamra]] (2), and part of [[Guelmim-Es Semara]] (3) were situated within the [[disputed territory]] of [[Western Sahara]]. The sovereignty of Western Sahara is disputed between Morocco and the [[Polisario Front]] which claims the territory as the independent [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]]. Most of the region is administered by Morocco as its [[Southern Provinces]]. The Polisario Front, based in headquarters at [[Tindouf]] in south western [[Algeria]], controls only those areas east of the [[Moroccan Wall]].

==Regions before 1997==
Before 1997, Morocco was divided into 7 regions: Central, Eastern, North-Central, Northwestern, South-Central, Southern, Tansift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/uma.html|title=Morocco Regions|author=|date=|website=www.statoids.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010154745/http://www.statoids.com/uma.html|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rold Skov''' (Rold Forest) is a forest in [[Himmerland]], [[Denmark]]. At 8,000 ha, it is the second largest forest in the country, after the [[Silkeborg Forests]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trae.dk/index.asp?page=/dokumenter/dokument.asp%3FDokumentID%3D1092 Denmarks 10 largest forests] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308120621/http://www.trae.dk/index.asp?page=%2Fdokumenter%2Fdokument.asp%3FDokumentID%3D1092 |date=2012-03-08 }} The Danish Wood Initiative (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The forest is named after the village of Rold which lies in the southern outskirt of the forest. Other towns in Rold Skov include [[Arden municipality|Arden]], Rebild and [[Skørping]].

== Description ==
Rold Skov comprises several distinct areas and woodlands in a very hilly terrain, giving rise to a number of springs (Lille Blåkilde, Ravnkilde, Gravlevkilden, Egebækkilden), streams and lakes such as Madum Lake, Økssø, Mossø and the newly restored Gravlev Lake. [[Rebild  National Park]], a natural site consisting of [[heath]]er-covered hills, is located in the northern parts of the forest. To the east of the town of Rebild, lies the abandoned [[limestone]] mines of Thingbæk ('Thingbæk Kalkminer'), now used for underground art exhibitions and an important site for five species of [[hibernating]] [[bats]] in the winter months. The mines are administered through Rebildcentret, who also hosts various museums, activities and some conservation efforts in the area. South of Skørping is the Jyske Skovhave ('Jylland Forest Garden'), an open [[arboretum]] begun in 1886 and displaying a variety of trees and shrubs from the [[northern hemisphere]].

The forest is part of the [[Natura 2000]] network (#18 ''Rold Skov, Lindenborg Ådal og Madum Sø'') and is both a [[Habitats Directive|EU habitat]] and a [[Ramsar wetland of international importance]].

75% of the forest is privately owned, primarily under the manors of Lindenborg, Nørlund and Willestrup. The state of Denmark owns and administers the rest.  

==History==
Although Denmark is normally considered a safe country nowadays, Rold Skov was formerly associated with robberies and violent assaults for centuries. In the 1830s the authorities succeeded in unraveling maybe the largest gang of all, with more than a hundred robbers and courtcases spanning a total of seven years from 1837 to 1844. The events and the gangs activities were later described in a novel by Danish writer [[Steen Steensen Blicher]]. 

The closed civil government atomic [[bunker]] of Denmark, named Regan Vest ([[:da:Regan Vest]]), is located in the forest.

[[File:Cervus elaphus Luc Viatour 6.jpg|thumb|right|The red deer stags, are the largest animal in Rold Skov.]]
Rold Skov has a rich and varied fauna. It is home to a large variety of birds and the larger animals here are [[red deer]], [[roe deer]], [[badger]] and [[fox]], among many different smaller animals like [[otter]], [[stoat]], [[bat]]s and different kinds of [[rodent]]s including [[squirrels]]. 

Large parts of the woods are dominated by various [[conifer]]s and the flora of the forest floor is rather poor of species in most areas. Where chalk comes to the surface layers, it can present some rare and more interesting plant species though, like the rare [[Cypripedium|lady's-slipper orchid]] growing side by side with plants like [[Anemone hepatica|pennywort]], [[Anemone nemorosa|smell fox]] and [[red helleborine]] for example. Note: In Denmark all orchids are to be protected and it is not allowed to pick them. 

Rold Skov supports a very broad array of [[fungi]], with 5,000 different species and still counting. There are well known eating mushrooms to be found, but also fungi like the peculiar ''Troldsmør'' ("Troll-butter" or ''[[fuligo septica]]'') that can move around, the beautiful [[Amanita muscaria|fly agaric]], the [[Fomes fomentarius|tinder fungus]] used for lighting fire in the old days or the tricky [[Tylopilus felleus|bitter bolete]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1367">The '''seat of government''' is (as defined by ''Brewer's Politics'') "the building, complex of buildings or the city from which a [[government]] exercises its [[authority]]".&lt;ref&gt;Comfort, N. (1993) Brewer's Politics. A phrase and fable dictionary. London: Cassell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The national government is usually located in the [[Capital city|capital]]. In most countries, the capital and the seat of government are the same city; for example, [[Ankara]] is both the capital and seat of government of [[Turkey]]. [[London]] is additionally the capital city of both [[England]] and the [[United Kingdom]], seating the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK's government]].

The terms are not completely synonymous, as [[List of countries with multiple capitals|some countries]]' seat of government differs from the capital. The [[Netherlands]], for example, has [[Amsterdam]] as its capital but [[The Hague]] is the seat of government; and the [[Philippines]], with [[Manila]] as its capital but [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] (NCR) is the seat of government.

Local and regional authorities usually have a seat ([[administrative centre]]) as well.

[[File:Great Lakes Snowbelt EPA fr.png|thumb|upright=2|Map showing the snowbelts around the Great Lakes of North America with {{convert|150|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} accumulations or more during winter]]
'''Snowbelt''' is a term describing a number of regions near the [[Great Lakes]] in [[North America]] where heavy [[snow]]fall in the form of [[lake-effect snow]] is particularly common.&lt;ref name="News5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/weather/weather_news/where-is-northern-ohio's-snow-belt|title=Where is northern Ohio's snow belt?|author=Mark Johnson|publisher=News Channel 5|date=November 12, 2010|accessdate=August 25, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119083803/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/weather/weather_news/where-is-northern-ohio%27s-snow-belt|archivedate=November 19, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowbelts are typically found downwind of the lakes, principally off the eastern and southern shores. Lake-effect snow occurs when cold air moves over warmer water, taking up moisture that later precipitates as snow when the air moves over land and cools.&lt;ref name="News5"/&gt; The lakes produce [[snowsquall]]s and persistently cloudy skies throughout the winter, as long as air temperatures are colder than water temperatures, or until a lake freezes over.

[[File:Snow-removal-cleveland-3.jpg|thumb|left|Northeast Ohio Primary and Secondary Snow Belts]]In the [[United States of America|United States]], snowbelts are located southeast of [[Lake Erie]] from [[Cleveland, Ohio]], to [[Buffalo, New York]], and south of [[Lake Ontario]] stretching roughly from [[Rochester, New York]], to [[Utica, New York]], and northward to [[Watertown, New York]]. Other snowbelts are located on the eastern shore of [[Lake Michigan]] from [[Gary, Indiana]], northward through [[Western Michigan]] and [[Northern Michigan]] to the [[Straits of Mackinac]], and on the eastern and southern shores of [[Lake Superior]] from northwest [[Wisconsin]] through the northern half of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]].

Portions of the snowbelt are located in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/snowfall-coming-to-the-snow-belt-1.736941|title=Snowfall coming to the snow belt|publisher=The Canadian Press/CTV News|date=December 7, 2011|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the eastern shore of Lake Superior from [[Sault Ste Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] northward to [[Wawa, Ontario|Wawa]], as well as the eastern and southern shores of [[Lake Huron]] and [[Georgian Bay]] from [[Parry Sound, Ontario|Parry Sound]] to [[London, Ontario|London]]. During the winter, north-westerly winds cause frequent road closures, with [[Ontario Highway 21|Highway 21]] on the Lake Huron coast and [[Ontario Highway 26|Highway 26]] south of Georgian Bay as far east as [[Barrie|Barrie, Ontario]], being strongly affected. The [[Niagara Peninsula]] and the north-eastern shores of Lake Ontario are especially hard-hit by heavy snowfall when south-western winds are predominant.

Lake Erie is the second smallest of the five Great Lakes and the most shallow. It can completely freeze over during winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mlakeeffectsnow.html|title=What's the physics behind "lake effect snow"?|author=Staff: Straight Dope Science Advisory Board|publisher=The Straight Dope|date=May 30, 2002|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once frozen, lake-effect snow over land to the east and south of Lake Erie is temporarily alleviated. This does not end the possibility of a damaging winter storm. The [[Blizzard of 1977|Great Lakes Blizzard of 1977]] that struck metropolitan Buffalo was a direct result of powder snow blown by high winds off Lake Erie, which had frozen earlier than normal. There was, for the region, no significant snowfall during the duration of the blizzard.

Healthy [[skiing]] industries have been established in snowbelt regions located near major cities such as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Toronto]]. The Erie/Ontario snowbelt, which extends to the northern slopes of the [[Allegheny Plateau]], has lent the region its nickname: [[ski country]]. To the south of Georgian Bay, ski resorts are found on the [[Niagara Escarpment]] at [[Blue Mountain (ski resort)|Blue Mountain]] and on the [[Oro Moraine]].

Snowbelt conditions also are found on the west side of the Japanese island of [[Hokkaido]] and the west side of Russia's [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. Here, cold winds blowing outward from the Siberian winter high pressure system pick up moisture while crossing the [[Sea of Japan]] and the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] and release it as heavy snowfall over the respective [[snow country (Japan)|land areas]]. [[Sweden]]'s east coast can be affected by snowbelt conditions, particularly in the early winter when there is little ice on the [[Baltic Sea]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7418">'''Susan E. Hanson''' (born 1943) is an American [[Geography|geographer]]. She is a Distinguished University Professor Emerita in the Graduate School of Geography at [[Clark University]]. Her research has focused on gender and work, travel patterns, and feminist scholarly approaches.

==Career==
Hanson studied as an undergraduate at [[Middlebury College]] between 1960 and 1964, subsequently working with the [[Peace Corps]] in Kenya. She studied for a PhD at [[Northwestern University]] between 1967 and 1973. Hanson was awarded [[tenure]] at the [[University at Buffalo]], where she worked in the geography and sociology departments between 1972 and 1980. She moved to Clark in 1981. She is a past president of the [[American Association of Geographers]] (then known as the Association of American Geographers)&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8QuqBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT1491#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Hanson, Susan (1943–)|last=Pavlovskaya|first=Marianna|year=2010|title=Encyclopedia of Geography|volume=3|editor-first=Barney|editor-last=Warf|pages=1400–1401|isbn=9781412956970|location=London|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the editor of four geography journals: ''[[Urban Geography (journal)|Urban Geography]]'', ''[[Economic Geography (journal)|Economic Geography]]'', the ''[[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]]'', and ''[[The Professional Geographer]]''.&lt;ref name=GoLocalWorcester/&gt;

Victoria Lawson has argued that Hanson's career "is an empowering example of a collage of woven-together life experiences, substantive research interests, feminist values and progressive professional practices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Composing our careers: Susan Hanson's contributions to geography and geographers|first=Victoria|last=Lawson|journal=Gender, Place &amp; Culture|volume=17|issue=1|year=2010|pages=49–54|doi=10.1080/09663690903522230}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Marianna Pavlovskaya wrote that Hanson "is one of the most accomplished academics in U.S. geography today".&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

==Honors and awards==
Hanson was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/susan-hanson/|title=Susan Hanson|publisher=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaas.org/content/hanson-susan|title=SUSAN HANSON|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999 received the [[Van Cleef Memorial Medal]] from the [[American Geographical Society]], a medal conferred on scholars in the field of [[urban geography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americangeo.org/van-cleef-memorial-medal/|title=Van Cleef Memorial Medal|publisher=American Geographical Society|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, she became the first female geographer to be elected to both the [[National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

At the 2008 Association of American Geographers conference, three panels were dedicated to honouring her contribution to the discipline, and five of the papers presented were subsequently published as a themed section of an issue of ''[[Gender, Place &amp; Culture: A Journal of Feminist Geography]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Honoring Susan Hanson's 45 years in geography|last=Pavlovskaya|first=Marianna|journal=[[Gender, Place &amp; Culture: A Journal of Feminist Geography|Gender, Place &amp; Culture]]|volume=17|issue=1|year=2010|pages=25–29|doi=10.1080/09663690903519780}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded the 2015 Stanley Brunn Award for Creativity in Geography by the American Association of Geographers,&lt;ref name=GoLocalWorcester&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.golocalworcester.com/business/clark-professor-honored-for-creativity-in-geography|title=Clark's Professor Hanson Honored for Creativity in Geography|publisher=GoLocalWorcester|date=December 15, 2014|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also awarded her Lifetime Achievement Honors in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aag.org/cs/honors|title=Honors of the American Association of Geographers|publisher=American Association of Geographers|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27871">The '''value-action gap''' is the space that occurs when the values (personal and cultural) or attitudes of an individual do not correlate to his or her actions. More generally, it is the difference between what people say and what people do. The phrase is associated with environmental geography, relating to attitudes and behaviors surrounding environmental issues.  Usually attitudes affect behavior; however the opposite often seems to be the case with regard to environmental attitudes and values.

The outcome is that there is a gap between the high value people place on the [[natural environment]] and the relatively low level of action taken by individuals to counter environmental problems. This disparity has been termed the ''value-action gap'', the ''attitude-behavior gap'', the ''intention-behavior gap'', the ''KAP-gap'' (acknowledge-attitudes-practice gap) or the ''belief-behavior gap''.&lt;ref name=Kollmuss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kollmuss|first=Anja|author2=Julian Agyeman |title=Mind the Gap: Why do people act environmentally and what are the barriers to pro-environmental behavior?|journal=Environmental Education Research|year=2002|volume=8|issue=3|pages=239–260|doi=10.1080/13504620220145401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diffusion of Innovations (5th ed.)|last=Rogers|first=E.M.|publisher=Free Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Godin|first=Gaston|last2=Conner|first2=Mark|last3=Sheeran|first3=Paschal|date=2005|title=Bridging the intention–behaviour gap: The role of moral norm|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/014466604X17452/abstract|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|language=en|volume=44|issue=4|pages=497–512|doi=10.1348/014466604X17452|issn=2044-8309|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debates surrounding the issue of the value-action gap have mainly taken place within [[Environmental psychology|environmental]] and [[social psychology]] and research is often based within cognitive theories of how attitudes are formed and how this affects individuals’ behavior.&lt;ref name="Blake"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blake|first=J.|date=1999|year=|title=Overcoming the 'value-action gap' in environmental policy: Tensions between national policy and local experience|url=|journal=Local Environment: The International Journal of Justice and Sustainability|volume=4|issue=3|pages=257–278|doi=10.1080/13549839908725599|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kowalska-Pyzalska|first=Anna|last2=Maciejowska|first2=Katarzyna|last3=Suszczyński|first3=Karol|last4=Sznajd-Weron|first4=Katarzyna|last5=Weron|first5=Rafał|date=2014|title=Turning green: Agent-based modeling of the adoption of dynamic electricity tariffs|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421514002377|journal=Energy Policy|volume=72|issue=|pages=164–174|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2014.04.021|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aims to explain why those with a high regard for environmental issues do not translate this concern into behaviors to solve environmental issues.

The research suggests that there are many internal and external factors that affect behavior and the reasons behind consumer choices. Therefore, it can be difficult to identify the exact reasons for why this gap exists. When purchasing a product for example, many attributes are assessed by the purchaser in order to make their decision such as; price, quality, convenience, and brand familiarity.&lt;ref name=Dickson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dickson|first=M.|title=Utility of no sweat labels for apparel consumers: Profiling label users and predicting their purchases|journal=The Journal of Consumer Affairs|year=2001|volume=35|issue=1|pages=96–119|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6606.2001.tb00104.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors influence the reasons behind buying behavior and environmental considerations are often not taken into account, regardless of the attitudes people have regarding the environment.

Overcoming this gap is of particular importance for environmental policies as finding ways to overcome it should increase the effectiveness of these strategies. This would lead to a fundamental shift in behavior towards the environment and individuals’ use of natural resources, ensuring [[sustainable development]] and conservation of the environment.

== Development of the term ==

=== Summary ===
Theories regarding reasoned action state how attitudes shape and influence behavioral intention, which in term shape actions. The [[theory of reasoned action]] states that behavioral intention is dependent on attitudes surrounding that behavior and social norms.&lt;ref name=Fishbein&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishbein|first=M.|title=Belief, attitude, intention, and behavior: An introduction to theory and research.|year=1975|publisher=MA: Addison-Wesley|location=Reading|author2=I. Ajzen }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a person acts or behaves in a way that correlates to their attitudes towards that behavior. Therefore, a person’s voluntary behavior can be predicted by his/her attitudes and values on that behavior.&lt;ref name=Kaiser&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=F.|author2=S.Wolfing,  U. Fuhrer |title=5. Environmental Attitude Andecological Behaviour|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=1999|volume=19|pages=1–19|doi=10.1006/jevp.1998.0107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homer and Kahle (1988) argue that attitudes influence behaviors and can explain the reasons behind human behavior. However, this is often not the case for actions related to environmental behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Homer|first=P.|author2=L. Kahle |title=A Structural Equation Test of the Value–Attitude–Behavior Hierarchy|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1998|volume=54|issue=4|pages=638–646|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.4.638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Barr (2004), in recent decades, public support for environmental protection measures has grown.&lt;ref name=Barr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barr|first=S.|title=Are We All Environmentalists Now? Rhetoric and Reality In Environmental Action|journal=Geoforum|year=2004|volume=35|issue=2|pages=231–249|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2003.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been fuelled by pressure groups, consumer groups, and even businesses.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=W. |author2=Hwang K. |author3=McDonald S. |author4=Oates C. |title=Sustainable Consumption: Green Consumer Behaviour When Purchasing Products|journal=Sustainable Development|year=2010|volume=18|pages=20–31|doi=10.1002/sd.394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, increased media coverage of environmental disasters has also resulted in a heightened concern of such issues. This was given a political boost by the publication of the [[Stern Review]] on the Economics of Climate Change. Therefore, people are more aware of environmental issues, such as [[global warming]] or [[climate change]] and it is often reported that many people have a high concern for environmental issues. For example, Dunlap (2002) used survey data which states that 54% of Americans agreed environmental protection was a key priority, even if economic growth was restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunlap|first=R.E.|title=An enduring concern|journal=Public Perspective|date=September–October 2002|pages=10–14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Banerjee and Solomon (2003) also argue that the general support for [[Ecolabel]]s is high among the US public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=A.|author2=Solomon B. |title=Eco-labelling for energy efficiency and sustainability: a meta-evaluation of US programs|journal=Energy Policy|year=2003|volume=31|issue=2|pages=109–123|doi=10.1016/s0301-4215(02)00012-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these studies in mind, it is expected that there would be an increase in pro-environmental behavior, such as recycling or limiting energy usage. However, a significant increase has not been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flynn|first=R.|author2=P. Bellaby |author3=M. Ricci |title=The ‘value-action gap’ in public attitudes towards sustainable energy: the case of hydrogen energy|journal=The Sociological Review|year=2010|volume=57|pages=159–180|doi=10.1111/j.1467-954x.2010.01891.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, attitudes are not always a clear prediction of behavior, resulting in the ‘value-action gap’. The decision-making process is hard to predict as positive attitudes are not followed by positive intentions, and what shapes behavior is a complex process.&lt;ref name=Kollmuss/&gt; Even if values are high, few people take environmental actions which involve changes to their lifestyle and often environmental actions can be unrelated to particular concerns an individual may have. The result is that attitudes are not necessarily a clear determinant of behavior.

== Application ==
Even though many support pro-environmental trade in principle, this is often not taken into consideration as a purchase criterion. Cohen and Murphy (2001) argue that for around 40% of consumers the environmental friendliness of a product will never be a factor in purchasing decisions regardless of positive attitudes towards ethical consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=M|title=Exploring Sustainable Consumption: Environmental Policy and The Social Sciences|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier Science|location=Oxford|author2=Murphy J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many studies which support the existence of a value-action gap. Mostly these can be found within the field of environmental geography. This gap has been illustrated by Lane and Potter (2007) who found a discrepancy between attitudes and behavior regarding the adoption of cleaner vehicles. They reported that those with a concern for the environmental impact of cars did not translate this into behavioral changes at the individual level. Thus, consumers stated intention did not reflect their actual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lane|first=B.|author2=Potter S. |title=The Adoption Of Cleaner Vehicles In The UK: Exploring The Consumer Attitude–Action Gap|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|year=2007|volume=15|issue=11|pages=1085–1092|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2006.05.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This gap is also shown within the market share for environmental goods, as [[ethical consumerism]] is still relatively low. Vermeir and Verbeke (2006) point out that initiatives such as legally logged wood, often have market shares of less than 1%, which they argue is partly due to the value-action gap.&lt;ref name=Vermeir&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vermeir|first=I.|author2=Verbeke W. |title=Sustainable Food Consumption: Exploring the Consumer "Attitude – Behavioural Intention" Gap|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics|year=2006|volume=19|issue=2|pages=169–194|doi=10.1007/s10806-005-5485-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even well known, high-profile ethical products still have a small percentage of the market share. Ronchi (2006) reports that the global sales of [[Fairtrade]] were over US$83 million in 2003, yet the total value of Fairtrade sales accounts for little over 0.01% of global trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ronchi|first=L.|title=Fairtrade and Market Failures in Agricultural Commodity Markets|journal=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper|year=2006|volume=No. 4011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, consumers’ buying behavior does not reflect their positive attitudes toward ethical products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Pelsmacker|first=P. |author2=Driesen L. |author3=Rayp G.|title=Do Consumers Care about Ethics? Willingness to Pay for Fair-Trade Coffee J|journal=Journal of Consumer Affairs|year=2006|volume=39|issue=2|pages=363–385|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6606.2005.00019.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vermeir and Verbeke (2006) also found that there was an inconsistency between the positive attitudes consumer expressed towards sustainability and their behavioral patterns. They found that intentions to buy sustainable dairy products were low regardless of positive attitudes towards these products. They argue that environmental factors are only taken into consideration for a minority of consumers, which means these markets remain small and only attracting a particular niche of consumer. For the majority of consumers other factors are more significant than values relating to the environment when purchasing products. Therefore, positive attitude towards sustainable products are not followed by sustainable actions, contrary to the theory of reasoned action. However, they also found that people’s perceptions of the availability of sustainable dairy products was low, which might explain why intentions to buy was low.&lt;ref name=Vermeir/&gt;

== Key issues ==
The main issues surrounding the value action gap are described below:

=== Factors that affect behavior ===
The key issue is why people's attitudes often fail to materialize into actions.&lt;ref name=Barr /&gt; Many factors exist that lead to an individual’s behavior, and therefore it is not just personal values that affect behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gadenne|first=David|last2=Sharma|first2=Bishnu|last3=Kerr|first3=Don|last4=Smith|first4=Tim|date=2011|title=The influence of consumers' environmental beliefs and attitudes on energy saving behaviours|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511006914|journal=Energy Policy|series=Clean Cooking Fuels and Technologies in Developing Economies|volume=39|issue=12|pages=7684–7694|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2011.09.002|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, people’s values are not fixed and are negotiated, and sometimes contradictory. Thus, cognitive factors alone will not adequately explain environmental action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chung|first=S.S|author2=M. Leung |title=The Value-Action Gap in Waste Recycling: The Case of Undergraduates in Hong Kong|journal=Environmental Management|year=2007|volume=40|issue=4|pages=603–612|doi=10.1007/s00267-006-0363-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blake (1999) argues that the relationship between attitudes and behaviors is moderated by the structure of personal attitudes themselves; and external or situational constraints. He argues that if attitudes are based on direct experience then they are more likely to be predictors of behavior and behaviors often result from social norms. Behaviors can also be restricted by external or situational constraints which refer to restrictions outside the individual’s control, such as economic or political factors.&lt;ref name=Blake /&gt;

There are many different theories regarding how consumers make decisions. These can be applied to try to explain why there is a value-action gap for some behaviors. For example, as  Sammer and Wüstenhagen (2006:188) point out [[microeconomic theory]] ([[consumer theory]]) states that, “humans make decisions that maximize their utility”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sammer|first=K.|author2=Wüstenhagen R. |title=The Influence Of Eco-Labelling On Consumer Behaviour – Results Of A Discrete Choice Analysis For Washing Machines|journal=siness Strategy and the Environment Special Issue: Sustainability Marketing|year=2006|volume=15|issue=2|pages=185–199|doi=10.1002/bse.522}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if buying environmental products does not maximize an individual’s utility then they will not purchase them, regardless of their attitudes towards these issues.  Making decisions requires a comparison of the costs and benefits of alternative actions within a specific budget, rather than about certain values. Young ''et al.'' (2010) argue that the gap can be due to “brand strength; culture, finance; habit; lack of information; lifestyles; personalities; or, trading off between different ethical factors” (p 22). Moreover, time or convenience can often be the major determinant of consumer behavior, and therefore the value-action gap is understandable for environmental products, as other constraints are more dominant. This means other factors, such as price or quality, are still more important.&lt;ref name=Young /&gt;

Vermeir and Verbeke (2006) argue that consumers are passive with regard to [[sustainable consumption]], and work within their budget rather than following their values . Furthermore, behavior is often based on habit and therefore values concerning the environment are usually not taken into consideration.&lt;ref name=Vermeir /&gt;  People act impulsively and in ways that do not correspond to their declared evaluations and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boulstridge|first=E.|author2=M. Carrigan |title="Do consumers really care about corporate responsibility? Highlighting the attitude—behaviour gap",|journal=Journal of Communication Management|year=2000|volume=4|issue=1|pages=355–368|doi=10.1108/eb023532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Chatzidakis ''et al.'' (2007) argue that consumers use [[Techniques of neutralization|neutralization techniques]] to justify pursuing their more selfish goals instead of purchasing environmental friendly products. Environmental values are usually less dominant in the decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chatzidakis|first=A.|author2=Hibbert S |author3=Smith AP |title=Why People Don’t Take their Concerns about Fair Trade to the Supermarket: The Role of Neutralisation|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|year=2007|volume=74|pages=89–100|doi=10.1007/s10551-006-9222-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the main motivation for actions is self-interest rather than altruistic. Therefore, this may account for the low market share of sustainable products.&lt;ref name=McEachern&gt;{{cite journal|last=McEachern|first=m.|author2=P. McClean |title=29. Organic purchasing motivations and attitudes: are they ethical?|journal=International Journal of Consumer Studies|year=2002|volume=26|issue=2|pages=85–92|doi=10.1046/j.1470-6431.2002.00199.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Information deficit ===
The most effective means to overcome the 'value-action gap' is to translate environmental concern into pro-environmental behavior. This may be achieved through increasing information. Therefore, one key explanation for the discrepancy between attitudes and buying behavior is the lack of information on specific issues.&lt;ref name=Dickson /&gt;

Blake (1999) identifies that the core assumption regarding the value-action gap is that the main barrier between environmental concern and action is the lack of appropriate information. In models of behavior, information generates knowledge, which then shapes attitudes, leading to behavior.&lt;ref name=Blake /&gt;  Eden (1996) argues that polices fail to understand the gap between information and action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eden|first=S.|title=Public participation in environmental policy: considering scientific, counter-scientific and non-scientific contributions|journal=Public Understanding of Science|year=1996|volume=5|pages=183–203|doi=10.1088/0963-6625/5/3/001}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that understanding issues creates awareness and it is this understanding that is the cause of behavior.  Hence, it is often considered that one of the most effective ways to encourage pro-environmental behavior is to highlight important facts relevant to the issues. This is referred to as the ‘information deficit model’ of behavior change, which is based on the assumption that providing knowledge about the consequences of certain actions, would lead to a change in behavior.&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess |author2=Harrison C. M. |author3=Filius P|title=Environmental Communication And The Cultural Politics Of Environmental Citizenship,|journal=Environment and Planning A|year=1998|volume=30|pages=1445–1460|doi=10.1068/a301445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental education and new knowledge is one way in which these environmental messages can be delivered, and therefore filling the value-action gap with information could help towards a change public behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gale|first=H.|title=How does drama work in environmental education?|journal=Earth &amp; Environment|year=2008|volume=3|pages=159–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Owens (2000: 1142) argues that “if people had more information about environmental risks, they would become more virtuous”.&lt;ref name=Owens&gt;{{cite journal|last=Owens|first=S.|title=Engaging The Public: Information And Deliberation In Environmental Policy|journal=Environment and Planning A|year=2000|volume=32|pages=1141–1148|doi=10.1068/a3330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional thinking supported this idea that increased knowledge tended to encourage favorable attitudes which, in turn, lead to pro-environmental action.  This relates to broader issues relative to methods of [[environmental governance]]. Attempts by government to affect public behavior have traditionally been based on increasing environmental awareness.  Many [[environmental policies]] are based on this ‘information deficit model’ as policy-makers assume knowledge on certain issues will lead people to act in order to meet policy objectives.&lt;ref name=Blake /&gt;  Owens (2000) points out that governments often aim to encourage action through big publicity campaigns and changing behavior. For example, the UK government’s ‘Are You Doing Your Bit?’ campaign which was launched in 1998 aimed to develop public understanding of sustainable development, and thus, to encourage a change in behavior of individuals. Additionally, many [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) campaign for increasing awareness, on the assumption that this will led to action.&lt;ref name=Kollmuss /&gt; Some argue that to increase environmental action there needs to be educational marketing campaigns on the environmental issues to change people’s attitudes towards these issues, and thus change their behavior.&lt;ref name=McEachern /&gt;

However, the effect of information on behavioral change is debatable. Different people will respond and interpret the same environmental information in various ways and sometimes it is interpreted in an opposite way to what is expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=G.|author2=Macnaghten, P. |title=Rhetorics of environmental sustainability: commonplaces and places|journal=Environment and Planning A|year=1998|volume=30|issue=2|doi=10.1068/a300333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barr and Gilg (2002) argue that just increasing information will not lead to a behavior change that would close this gap, and information-intensive campaigns are likely to be unproductive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barr|first=S.|author2=A. Gilg|date=|year=1998|title=Sustainable lifestyles: Framing environmental action in and around the home|url=http://www.lifestylesandlifecourses.org/Staff/_private/Barr,%20S.%20&amp;%20Gilg,%20A.W.%20(2006)%20%27Sustainable%20Lifestyles...%27.pdf|journal=Geoforum|volume=37|pages=906-920|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2006.05.002|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the increased media attention surrounding environmental issues and organizations such as [[Greenpeace]] having a high profile, it could be argued that there is already a lot of information on these issues, and it is considered that general awareness on environmental issues is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thornton|first=A.|title=Public attitudes and behaviours towards the environment – tracker survey: A report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|year=2009|publisher=Defra|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sammer and Wüstenhagen (2006) point out that while people may be aware of environmental issues, this does not necessarily mean that they play a major role in their actions. These findings suggest that the 'value-action gap' cannot be overcome simply by using an 'information deficit' model of individual participation. Increasing information does not itself guarantee action at the individual level and information campaigns intended to raise awareness are not as effective as some may suppose.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=T|title=Motivating Sustainable Consumption: A Review Of Evidence On Consumer Behaviour And Behavioural Change. A report to the Sustainable Development Research Network.|year=2005|publisher=SDRN|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This raises issues regarding the effectiveness of methods used by NGOs, whose activities generally involve awareness campaigns and the use of non-state market driven ([[NSMD]]) forms of governance which rely on consumers to create change. If attitudes are not translated into behavior then these methods are essentially flawed. This would suggest that other methods are more appropriate to encourage environmental action, such as regulation and economic incentives (taxes and grants).&lt;ref name=Retallack&gt;{{cite book|last=Retallack|first=S.|title=Positive Energy: Harnessing people power to prevent climate change – a summary,|year=2007|publisher=IPPR|location=London |author2=T. Lawrence |author3=M. Lockwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barriers to behavior ===
It is widely considered that many other barriers exist, besides a lack of information, which inhibit ethical behavior causing a value-action gap to exist.

Retallack ''et al.'' (2007) identifies other barriers such as uncertainty, skepticism about the issue and distrust of national governments and organizations.&lt;ref name=Retallack /&gt;  Jackson (2005) uses the concept of ‘bounded rationality’ to explain how individuals’ decision making processes are ‘bounded’ by psychological and environmental constraints.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

Blake (1999) points out that various models of behavior are flawed in that they fail to take into consideration the social, individual and institutional constraints.&lt;ref name=Blake /&gt; Various conditions and personal day-to-day responsibilities constrain actions that can be regarded as ethical. Blake identifies that this gap is not empty, but is filled with barriers that block the progress from environmental concern to environmental action. In his model, action is blocked by many factors intruding into the process, rather than just a lack of information.  Thus, the cause of the value-action gap can be explained in terms of personal, social and structural barriers to action. Blake identifies three categories of obstacles that exist between the environmental concern and action: individuality; responsibility and practicality. However, which factors are important will vary for different individuals and environmental actions. Moreover, barriers often overlap and are combined which limits behavioral change. 
  
* Individual barriers refer to environmental concerns being outweighed by other conflicting attitudes. People may perceive themselves as the wrong type of person to carry out ethical actions or have a lack of interest in environmental issues, e.g. a divorce of position.
* Responsibility barriers refers to the idea that people may not act, despite supporting environmental action, because they believe it is not their responsibility to help solve environmental problems. This is supported by Jackson (2005) who identifies that the acceptance of personal responsibility for one’s actions, and their consequences, is the basis for the intention to perform a pro-environmental behavior. People may also not act because they possess a lack of trust for national governments and organizations which aim to tackle environmental issues.,&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt; e.g. cynicism.
* Finally, practical constraints prevent people from adopting pro-environmental action, regardless of their attitudes or intentions. These include lack of time, money, physical storage space (in the case of recycling), encouragement and pro-environmental facilities such as recycling and adequate public transport provision. Some people may also be physically unable to carry out some environmental actions, e.g. space limitations.
Therefore, Blake argues that policies need to tackle these barriers, not just provide more information or recycling facilities.

A '''water level'''; {{lang-el|'''[[Aλφαδολάστιχο]]''' or '''[[(υδροστάθμη)]]'''}} ''[Alfadolasticho]'' is a device used for matching [[elevation]]s of locations that are too far apart for a [[spirit level]] to span. The simplest water level is a section of clear tubing, partially filled with water. Water is easily procured for use, and easily discarded after use. The ends are held vertical, and the rest of the tubing lies on the ground or floor. The water level at each end of the tube will be at the same elevation, whether the two ends are adjacent or far apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Stoddard |url=http://www.deckmagazine.com/products/tools-equipment/making-and-using-a-water-level_o |title=Making and Using a Water Level |work=Professional Deck Builder |publisher=[[Hanley Wood]] Media |date=September 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water levels have been used for many years. The water level is [[low technology|lower-tech]] than the [[laser level]], but it can be more accurate over long distances, and works without a [[sightline]], such as around corners. To avoid error, all of the water should be at the same temperature. Other sources of [[error]] include difficulty reading due to [[meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]].

If the water level is used often, [[dye]] can be added to the water to make it easier to see. If the water level is used outdoors in winter, [[antifreeze]] can be added to the water. Automotive window washer fluid can also be used for antifreeze and increased visibility. Additionally it inhibits the formation of error causing bubbles. A [[surfactant]] (surface active agent), such as hand-[[dishwashing liquid]] [[detergent]], can be added to the water to significantly lower the [[surface tension]] of the water. This liquid solution will flow more easily and more rapidly in the tube than plain water, so operation of the device will be more precise, repeatable, and responsive – particularly when using a small-diameter tube. Also, this liquid solution can be emptied from a small-diameter tube more easily than plain water.

The '''Web Coverage Processing Service''' (WCPS) defines a language for filtering and processing of multi-dimensional raster [[Coverage data|coverages]], such as sensor, simulation, image, and statistics data. The Web Coverage Processing Service is maintained by the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC). This raster query language allows clients to obtain original coverage data, or derived information, in a platform-neutral manner over the Web.

== Overview ==
WCPS allows to generate pictures suitable for displaying to humans and information concise enough for further consumption by programs. In particular, the formally defined syntax and semantics make WCPS amenable to program-generated queries and automatic service chaining.

As the WCPS language is not tied to any particular transmission protocol, the query paradigm can be embedded into any service framework, such as OGC [[Web Coverage Service]] (WCS) and OGC [[Web Processing Service]] (WPS).

The current WCPS version is 1.0. The standards document,&lt;ref&gt;Baumann, P. (ed.): [http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=32319 OGC Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) Language], OGC document 08-068r2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; available from the OGC WCPS standards page,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcps OGC WCPS standards page]&lt;/ref&gt; presents a condensed definition of syntax and semantics. In addition, there is an introduction to the concepts along with design rationales.&lt;ref&gt;Baumann, P.: [http://www.springerlink.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;id=doi:10.1007/s10707-009-0087-2 The OGC Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) Standard]. Geoinformatica, 14(4)2010, pp. 447-479, DOI 10.1007/s10707-009-0087-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, WCPS is constrained to multi-dimensional [[Raster image|raster data]], but an activity is under work in OGC to extend it to all coverage types, i.e., digital geospatial information representing space-varying phenomena as defined in OGC Abstract Specification Topic 6: ''Schema for Coverage Geometry and Functions''&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=19820  OGC Abstract Specification Topic 6: Schema for Coverage Geometry and Functions, OGC 08-126]&lt;/ref&gt; (which is identical to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 19123) and refined to a concrete, interoperable model in the OGC ''GML 3.2.1 Application Schema - Coverages'' (GMLCOV) Standard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=48553 OGC GML Application Schema - Coverages, OGC 09-146r2]&lt;/ref&gt;

== WCPS Language in a Nutshell ==
[[File:Sample WCPS query results.png|thumb|400px|alt=Sample WCPS query results|Sample WCPS query results]]

WCPS establishes a protocol to send a query string to a server and obtain, as a result of the server's processing, a set of coverages.
The query string can be expressed in either ''Abstract Syntax'' or XML. In the following examples, Abstract Syntax will be used as it is more apt for human consumption.

The WCPS syntax tentatively has been crafted close to the XQuery language – as metadata more and more are established in XML, and OGC heavily relies on XML (such as [[Geography Markup Language]]), it is anticipated that eventually a combination of XQuery and WCPS will be established. This will unify data and metadata retrieval.

The following example may serve to illustrate these principles. Task is to ''inspect three coverages M1, M2, and M3; for each one, deliver the pixelwise difference of red and near-infrared (nir) channel; return the result encoded in HDF5'':
&lt;source lang="xbasic"&gt;
for $c in ( M1, M2, M3 )
return
    encode( abs( $c.red - $c.nir ), "hdf5" )
&lt;/source&gt;
This will return three coverages, that is: three HDF5 files.

Next, we are interested only in those coverages where nir exceeds 127 somewhere:
&lt;source lang="xbasic"&gt;
for $c in ( M1, M2, M3 )
where
    some( $c.nir &gt; 127 )
return
    encode( abs( $c.red - $c.nir ), "hdf5" )
&lt;/source&gt;
The result might be only two coverages that pass the filter.

Finally, we want to constrain the filter predicate through a pixel mask acting as filter:
&lt;source lang="xbasic"&gt;
for $c in ( M1, M2, M3 ),
    $r in ( R )
where
    some( $c.nir &gt; 127 and $r )
return
    encode( abs( $c.red - $c.nir ), "hdf5" )
&lt;/source&gt;

The evaluation procedure can be thought of as a nested loop. In general, the language allows to express a range of imaging, signal processing, and statistics operations. The limit is given because the language is ''safe in evaluation'', that is: every request is guaranteed to terminate after a finite number of steps. This excludes recursion. Still, algorithms like classification, filter kernels and general convolutions, histograms, and Discrete Fourier Transform are expressible.
