The '''2003 Sheraton Hawaii Bowl''' was played on December 25, 2003, in [[Honolulu]] and matched the hometown [[2003 Hawaii Warriors football team|Hawaii Warriors]] with the [[2003 Houston Cougars football team|Houston Cougars]]. This was the second [[Hawaii Bowl]], and the first time Hawaii and Houston played each other. The game was sponsored by [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts]].

==Game summary==
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2018}}
Houston scored first with a 34-yard touchdown pass from quarterback [[Kevin Kolb]] to wide receiver [[Chad McCullar]]. David Bell kicked a 21-yard field goal to increase Houston's lead to 10-0. Hawaii got its first points of the game at the end of the first quarter on a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, [[Timmy Chang]] found wide receiver [[Clifton Herbert]] for a 49-yard touchdown pass to make the score 10-10.

Running back [[Jackie Battle]] scored on a 2-yard touchdown run for Houston, as they increased their lead to 17-10. David Bell later kicked a field goal to increase the lead to 20-10. A Hawaii field goal before half time cut the lead to 20-13.

In the third quarter, running back [[Michael Brewster Jr.]] ran in for a touchdown tying the game at 20. Timmy Chang then threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Jason Rivers (American football)|Jason Rivers]], and Hawaii claimed its first lead of the game at 27-20. Jackie Battle scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and the score was 27-27. Jason Rivers caught a 4-yard touchdown pass to give Hawaii a 34-27 lead. In the fourth quarter, wide receiver [[Vincent Marshall]] caught an 81-yard touchdown pass to tie the game at 34. The game headed into overtime.

In overtime, Timmy Chang found [[Britton Komine]] for an 11-yard touchdown and a 41-34 Hawaii lead. Houston answered with an Anthony Evans touchdown run. After one overtime period the score was 41-41. On Houston's next possession, Jackie Battle got the handoff, and rushed 4&amp;nbsp;yards for a touchdown. The score was now 48-41 Houston. Jason Rivers tied it for Hawaii, by catching a 19-yard touchdown pass. In the third overtime period, Michael Brewster ran in for an 8-yard touchdown. The [[two-point conversion]] attempt failed leaving the score 54-48 Hawaii, and giving Houston a chance to win. Houston couldn't score, and that ended up being the final margin.

The game is also memorable for a fight between both teams that occurred after the game was over. Players from each team got into shouting matches and punches were thrown. Play-by-play announcer Dave Barnett called the ending sad and surprising.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5358">'''ʿAbdallāh ibn Saʿd ibn Abī Sarḥ;''' ({{lang-ar|عبدالله بن سعد بن أبي السرح}}) was the [[milk sibling|milk brother]] of [[Uthman]]. His father was Sa'd ibn Abi Sarh.

During his time as governor of Egypt (646 CE to 656 CE), Ibn Abi Sarh built a strong Egyptian Arab navy.  Under his leadership the Muslim navy won a number of victories including its first major naval battle against the Byzantine emperor [[Constans II (Byzantine Empire)|Constans II]] at the [[Battle of the Masts]] in 655 CE. One of his achievements while governor of Egypt was the capture of [[Tripoli]] in 647 whereby he brought [[Libya]] into the Islamic Empire.

==During Muhammad's era==
[[Al-Tabari]] has recorded in his [[tafsir]] that although Ibn Abi Sarh had apostatized, he returned to Islam before the [[conquest of Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://quran.al-islam.com/Page.aspx?pageid=221&amp;BookID=13&amp;Page=1 al-Tabari's Tafsir for 6:93]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Sources/Sarh/]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in his ''History'', al-Tabari records about Ibn Abi Sarh and Muhammad that "Abdallah b. Sa`d b. Abi Sarh used to write for him. He apostatized from Islam and later returned to Islam on the day of the conquest of Mecca".&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, "History of al-Tabari Vol. 9 - The Last Years of the Prophet", transl. Ismail K. Poonawala, p.148, Albany: State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt; A [[hadith]] in [[Sunan Abu Dawud]] records an account of Ibn Abi Sarh's tense encounter with Muhammad on that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=14&amp;translator=3&amp;start=0&amp;number=2677#2677 Translation of Sunan Abu-Dawud (partial). Translated by Professor Ahmad Hasan (online) Hadith 14:2677]&lt;/ref&gt;

==During Uthman’s era==
When [[Uthman]] became caliph in 644 CE, he appointed Abdallah governor of [[Egypt]] replacing [['Amr ibn al-'As]], with Muhammad ibn Hudhaifa as his aide. Abdallah brought over a large foreign entourage and established the [[divan|diwan]], "and commanded that all the taxes of the country should be regulated there".&lt;ref name=Benjamin&gt;Archdeacon George (fl. 715), as transferred to {{cite book | author1=Severus of Muqaffa | author2=B. Evetts | year=1904 | title=History of the Patriarchs of the Coptic church of Alexandria | chapter=Benjamin I |chapter-url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/severus_hermopolis_hist_alex_patr_02_part2.htm#BENJAMIN_I}} On George's authorship of Lives 27-42:{{cite book | title=Seeing Islam As Others Saw It | author=Robert G. Hoyland | year=1998 | publisher=Darwin Press |page=447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Copts]] viewed Abdallah as a "lover of money" who spent the revenues upon himself. In his time a famine struck Upper Egypt such that many Copts fled to the [[Nile Delta]].&lt;ref name=Benjamin /&gt; Soon the Arabs protested his governorship, too.

Some of the protests appear to have been instigated by his aide, Muhammad ibn Hudhaifa. Muhammad's father (Hudhaifa) was an early convert to Islam who died in the [[Battle of Yamama]]. Muhammad was raised by Uthman. When he reached maturity he participated in the foreign military campaigns and accompanied Abdullāh ibn Sa‘ad ibn Abī as-Sarh to [[Egypt]] as an aide. Muhammad bin Hudhaifa admonished Abdullah, recommending changes in the government but Abdallah did not respond. After continuous efforts, eventually Muhammad ibn Hudhaifa lost patience and turned from sympathetic admonisher to a disillusioned opponent – first of Ibn Abi Sarh and later of Uthman for appointing him. Ibn Abi Sarh wrote to Uthman claiming that Muhammad was spreading sedition and that if nothing was done to stop him, the situation would escalate. Uthman attempted to silence Muhammad's protests with 30,000 [[dirham]]s and expensive presents. This bribe backfired, with Muhammad bringing the money and presents into the Great Mosque saying;

:''“Do you see what Uthman is trying to do? He is trying to buy my faith. He has sent these coins and these goods to me as a bribe.”''

Uthman sent numerous placatory letters to Muhammad, but he continued building the agitation against Ibn Abi Sarh. In 656 the leaders of Egypt decided to send a delegation to [[Medina]] to demanding Ibn Abi Sarh's dismissal. Ibn Abi Sarh also left for Medina to defend himself at the court of the caliph. In his absence, Muhammad ibn Hudhaifa assumed charge of the government.

When Ibn Abi Sarh reached [[Elath]], he was told that Uthman's house was under siege ([[Siege of Uthman]]) and decided to return to Egypt. At the border he was informed that Muhammad ibn Hudhaifa had given orders to prevent him from entering Egypt. He then went to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] awaiting the outcome of events in Medina. In the meantime, Uthman was killed in Medina, and when Ibn Abi Sarh heard the news, he left Palestine, and went to [[Damascus]] to live under the protection of [[Muawiyah I]].

After taking control of [[Timbuktu]] in 2012, Abou Zeid established ''[[sharia]]'' law and destroyed [[Sufi]] shrines.

Abou Zeid was killed by French and Chadian troops on 25 February 2013 in fighting in [[Northern Mali]].&lt;ref name="lemon"/&gt; On 23 March, Zeid's death was "definitively confirmed" by the French president's office.&lt;ref name=AP(23.March.2013) /&gt; 

==Early life==
Abou Zeid was born in Algeria in 1965.&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chikhi|first=Lamine |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/02/28/uk-mali-rebels-qaeda-idUKBRE91R1L820130228|title=Al Qaeda commander Abou Zeid killed in Mali – Algeria's Ennahar TV|newspaper=Reuters|date=28 February 2013|accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Militant activities==
Abou Zeid was one of the senior members of [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]], (AQIM), an [[Islamist]] militant organization.&lt;ref name=bbc2mar&gt;{{cite news|title=Chad President Deby: Al Qaeda's Abou Zeid killed in Mali|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21637829|accessdate=5 March 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been promoted by the [[emir]] of AQIM, [[Abu Musab Abdel Wadoud]] (a.k.a. Abdelmalek Droukdel); some commentators speculated that Wadoud wanted to have an alternative to [[Mokhtar Belmokhtar]], an increasingly powerful commander in AQIM also operating in Mali.&lt;ref name="filiu2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Filiu|first=Jean Pierre|title=Could Al-Qaeda Turn African in the Sahel?|journal=Carnegie Papers|date=June 2010|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/files/al_qaeda_sahel.pdf|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Abou Zeid is believed to have ordered the executions of hostages, including Edwin Dyer in 2009 and Michel Germaneau in 2010.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/28/abdelhamid-abu-zeid-killed_n_2781588.html|title=Abdelhamid Abu Zeid, Al Qaeda Commander, Reportedly Killed In Mali|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=28 February 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to have been behind the kidnapping of more than 20 Westerners between 2008 and 2013. The victims were held to gain ransoms to fund the activities of AQIM.&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt; 

When Abou Zeid controlled [[Timbuktu]], he ordered amputations as punishment, and his forces destroyed historic [[Sufi]] shrines.&lt;ref name="torontosun1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Cheick Diouara|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/03/01/abou-zeid-killed-mali-locals-say-al-qaida-commander-dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130412011642/http://www.torontosun.com/2013/03/01/abou-zeid-killed-mali-locals-say-al-qaida-commander-dead|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 April 2013|title=Abou Zeid killed: Mali locals say al-Qaida commander dead|newspaper=Toronto Sun|date=1 March 2013|accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With both Abou Zeid and Belmokhtar exerting power in the Sahel region, in the fall of 2012, Wadoud appointed [[Djamel Okacha]] (also known as [[Yahya Abou el-Hammam]]) as the overall commander of AQIM in the Sahara, in an effort to keep control. According to a memo from him to Abou Zeid found in Timbuktu, Wadoud was concerned that the rapid push to establish Sharia law would provoke armed intervention. In January 2013, France and West African nations responded to the Malian government's request for help and entered with troops in northern Mali to dislodge AQIM.&lt;ref name="cnndouble"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/03/world/aqim-double-blow/ |author= Tim Lister and Paul Cruickshank|title=Al Qaeda reported to suffer double blow in Sahara|newspaper=CNN|date=26 January 2013|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hinshaw|first=Drew|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324662404578333971047215246 |title=Chad Claims Killing of al Qaeda Commander|work=Wall Street Journal|date=1 March 2013|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Leading a contingent of [[Islamist]]s in central [[Mali]], Abou Zeid attacked the small town of [[Diabaly]] in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/20/AR2010102005252.html |title='Emir of the south' Abu Zeid poised to take over al-Qaeda in NW Africa|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=20 October 2010|accessdate=18 January 2013|first=Edward|last=Cody}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Algerian hostage crisis raises the stakes in Mali|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/algerian-hostage-crisis-raises-the-stakes-in-mali/story-e6frg6so-1226556138023|accessdate=18 January 2013|newspaper=AFP|date=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of the Malian government, the French launched a quick intervention in January to drive the radical Islamists from northern Mali. They entered the area with 1,200 French troops, 800 Chadian soldiers and some elements of the Malian army, fighting in the Adrar mountain range.&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt;

==Death==
Abou Zeid was reported killed along with 40 militants on 25 February 2013, by French and Chadian troops near the mountainous region of Tigargara, [[Northern Mali]].&lt;ref name="lemon"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2013/02/28/un-chef-d-aqmi-a-ete-tue-par-l-armee-francaise-au-mali_1840892_3212.html|title=Un chef d'AQMI tué par l'armée française au Mali|newspaper=Le Monde|date=28 February 2013|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; At the time, he and his men were believed to be holding at least four French citizens who had been kidnapped in 2010 in [[Niger]].&lt;ref name="torontosun1"/&gt; His death was first reported by [[Algeria]]'s independent Ennahar TV on 28 February 2013.&lt;ref name=f245mar/&gt; On 1 March 2013, [[Idriss Deby]], [[President of Chad]], said his forces had killed Abou Zeid during fighting in northern Mali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chad Says Forces Killed Top Al-Qaida Commander|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/chad-says-forces-killed-top-alqaida-commander/1613626.html|newspaper=Voice of America|accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lwj3mar&gt;{{cite journal|title=Conflicting accounts emerge over AQIM leader's reported death|journal=Long War Journal|date=3 March 2013|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/threat-matrix/archives/2013/03/conflicting_accounts_over_aqim.php|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death was confirmed by an Al Qaeda member on 5 March.&lt;ref name=f245mar&gt;{{cite news|title=Al Qaeda leader Abou Zeid 'killed in Mali'|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20130304-al-qaeda-confirms-abou-zeid-death-mali-0|accessdate=5 March 2013|newspaper=FRANCE 24|date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inq4mar&gt;{{cite news|title=Al Qaeda confirms Abou Zeid killed in Mali|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/66673/al-qaeda-confirms-abou-zeid-killed-in-mali-report|accessdate=10 March 2013|newspaper=Inquirer|date=4 March 2013|agency=AFP|location=Nouakchott}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a [[Reuters]] security source, he was replaced as AQIM's leader by Algerian [[Djamel Okacha]] (a.k.a.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13569">'''Agostino Agresta''' (''fl.'' 1600–1617) was a [[Naples|Neapolitan]] composer working at the beginning of the 17th century, who can be seen as having been strongly influenced by [[Carlo Gesualdo]]. Agresta's only known surviving works are unaccompanied madrigals, including a complete book of six-voice pieces.

== Biography ==
Frustratingly little is known about the life and career of Agresta, including neither the circumstances of his birth or death. Apart from his works (discussed below), there are only two contemporary or near-contemporary references to him.

He and his elder brother Giovanni Antonio are listed together in the third book of Scipione Cerreto’s 1601 ''Della prattica musicale'' as excellent composers operating in Naples ('Compositori eccellenti della Città di Napoli, che oggi vivono'); however, no works by Giovanni Antonio survive. And a 1664 work by the Neapolitan scholar Camillo Tutini lists him as a madrigalist in a section devoted to promoting the cultural claims of Naples against Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Larson 1985: 916–919&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo'' (1617) ===
Agresta's only surviving book of madrigals, ''Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo'', was published in Naples in 1617 by Costantino Vitale, and dedicated to Don Roderico di Salazar. Salazar had been commissioner of contraband in the provinces of [[Terra di Bari]] and [[Capitanata]] (today the province of Foggia) but was prosecuted in 1607 for extortion and corruption (Larson 1985: 758); his status in 1617 is unknown.

Agresta's relationship to him is similarly unclear, although Larson has speculated&lt;ref&gt;Larson 1985: 758&lt;/ref&gt; that the composer may have been employed by Salazar as a tutor for his children, in a similar capacity to that of his brother in the household of the Count of Roccella (the records of the Banco Mari, which are contained in the Archivio di Stato in Naples, list a payment made to Giovanni Antonio Agresta on 18 March 1598).

While composers in the northern Italian peninsula were beginning to move away from what was regarded as the old-fashioned polyphonic madrigal without continuo, Naples remained the most important centre for its composition and publication. In this context, Agresta's ''Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo'' occupies an important position, as during the first 30&amp;nbsp;years of the 17th century only two books of six-part unaccompanied madrigals were published in Naples: Agresta's and Gesualdo's posthumous collection of 1626 (of which only the Quinto part-book survives). While it is impossible to speculate with any accuracy on the basis of such scant evidence, Larson suggests that Agresta's madrigals may reveal something of the style of Gesualdo’s incomplete book.&lt;ref&gt;Larson 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Watkins labels Agresta a minor figure among those Neapolitan composers who were influenced by Gesualdo, but suggests that posterity's opinion of him (and others) might well be different if more of his works had survived.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins 1991: 227–228&lt;/ref&gt; Larson goes further and declares that Agresta 'occasionally surpassed (Gesualdo) in the degree of slow chromatic ''durezze e ligature'' and diatonic, scalar points of imitation in quavers and semiquavers', claiming that 'the latter are usually longer and more lively and intricate than Gesualdo's'.&lt;ref&gt;Larson 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agresta's other madrigals ===
Apart from the ''Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo'', three other madrigals identified as being by Agresta survive, all for five voices:

* 'Io mi sento morir', in Giovanni Vincenzo Macedonio di Mutio's ''Il secondo libro de madrigali a cinque voci'', published in Naples in 1606 by Giovanni Giacomo Carlino. An incomplete and damaged set of part-books exists in the library of the Conservatorio di Musica San Pietro a Majella in Naples (missing Quinto, incomplete Soprano).
* 'Caro dolce ben mio', in ''Giardino novo bellissimo di varii fiori musicali scieltissimi il secondo libro de madrigali a cinque voci raccolti per Melchior Borchgrevinck organista del serenissimo re di Danemarcka'', published in Copenhagen in 1606 by Heinrich Waltkirch ([[RISM]] 1606&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;), which survives complete in the British Library, London, and incomplete (Soprano and Alto part-books only) in the Landesbibliothek Kassel. (This madrigal has previously been edited and published in Glahn et al. 1983&lt;ref&gt;Glahn et al. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* 'Io ard'e moro, Donna', in ''Teatro de madrigali a cinque voci. De diversi eccellentiss. musici napolitani'' ([[RISM]] 1609&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;), published in Naples in 1609 by Giovanni Battista Gargano and Lucretio Nucci. The only surviving copy of this is in the Landesbibliothek Kassel, with an incomplete Quinto part.

The inclusion of a piece by Agresta in the Borchgrevinck collection of 1606 raises many questions. [[Melchior Borchgrevinck]] was court organist to King [[Christian IV of Denmark]], and in 1599 led a party of Danish musicians to [[Venice]] to study with [[Giovanni Gabrieli]], returning there in the winter of 1601–2. He was greatly respected by his contemporaries, being praised by [[Orazio Vecchi]] in the dedication to Christian IV of ''Le veglie di Siena'' (1604), who also added that Gabrieli considered Borchgrevinck 'one of the most outstanding musicians of our time'.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2005: 372&lt;/ref&gt;

The two volumes of ''Giardino novo'' (the first appeared in 1605, dedicated to Christian IV) included madrigals by some of the most popular Italian composers of the day, including [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Benedetto Pallavicino]] and [[Giaches de Wert]], as well as Borchgrevinck and other Danish composers. However, there are a number of works by composers who may not unfairly be deemed minor figures, including Giovanni Paolo Nodari, Curtio Valcampi and Grisostomo Rubiconi, and which Lewis suggests may not previously have been printed.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2005: 373&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from 'Caro dolce ben mio', all Agresta's works were published in Naples, and there is no record of him ever having worked or travelled away from Naples, thus seemingly making him very much a southern Italian composer. How then did his works find their way north to Venice, and why was he considered a composer of sufficient stature to be included in a volume of works dedicated, in a politically charged, to King [[James I of England]]?&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2000: 10&lt;/ref&gt; While it was not unusual for Neapolitan composers to have their works printed in Venice (see Larson 1985: 873–882&lt;ref&gt;Larson 1985: 873–882&lt;/ref&gt; for a list of such works), the absence of any other evidence that links Agresta to Venice makes it hard to gauge his status and reputation during his lifetime.

There are two other references to Agresta which appear not to have been noted by other authors. In Schofield and [[Thurston Dart|Dart]]'s article describing the contents of the British Library manuscript now known as Egerton MS 3665, believed to have been compiled by [[Francis Tregian the Younger|Francis Tregian]] (son of [[Francis Tregian the Elder|the more famous Catholic exile of the same name]]), Agresta is listed among the composer represented in the selection of over 700 Italian madrigals included in the manuscript; it is implied in the article, although not clearly, that Agresta’s contribution comes from his ''Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo''.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield and Dart 1951: 213–214&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s Alfred Noe completed a comprehensive study of the contents of the library of Albert Fugger (of the famous Augsburg banking family), which was purchased by Mathias Mauchter in 1655 for Emperor Ferdinand III and now forms part of the [[Austrian National Library|Österreichische Nationalbibliothek]] in [[Vienna]].

In the catalogue made by Mauchter at the time of purchase, there is an entry on the last page of the music section which reads 'Il Primo lib.° de Madrigali a 5. di Agostino Agresta'.&lt;ref&gt;Noe 1994: 650&lt;/ref&gt; No collection of five-part madrigals by Agresta survives, nor any reference to one elsewhere. However, Noe identifies this volume as Agresta’s 1617 ''Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo''&lt;ref&gt;Noe 1997: 617&lt;/ref&gt; from its contents, regarding the 'a 5' as a copyist's mistake.

=== Sources ===
Two complete copies of Agresta’s ''Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo'' survive, one in the Collection 'G. Thibault' of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris, the other in the library of the [[Music conservatories of Naples|Conservatorio di Musica San Pietro a Majella]] in Naples; both are in good condition, and each is identical to the other. The print is on the large part free from errors.

=== The contents of ''Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo'' ===
Keith Larson has dealt extensively with the contents of Agresta's ''Madrigali a sei voci ... Libro primo'';&lt;ref&gt;Larson 1985: 757–764&lt;/ref&gt; here are some extra details to his analysis.

Numbers 1 to 8 are written in an 'ordinary' clef combination (Canto and Sesto in C1 clef, Alto in C3 clef, Tenore and Quinto in C4, and Basso in F4), while numbers 9 to 15 are written in 'high' clefs (Canto and Sesto in G2, Alto in C2, Tenore and Quinto in C3, and Basso in F3 – commonly known as ''chiavette''), suggesting downwards transposition.

If one follows [[Adriano Banchieri]]'s suggestion in his 1614 ''Cartella musicale'' of transposing pieces written in ''chiavette'' down by a perfect 4th when the printed key signature contains one flat and by a perfect 5th when it contains no flats, the transposed ranges of the individual voice parts of numbers 9 to 15 all become rather lower than the ranges of numbers 1 to 8. Depending on the singers involved in a performance, a downwards transposition of either a tone or a minor 3rd for numbers 9 to 15 is suggested.

The last piece in the collection, 'Io penso e nel pensar' is unusual in many ways. The anonymous poem is a dense play on the words 'penso' ('I think'), 'pensar' ('to think') and 'pensier' ('thought'); most striking is its use of frequently changing time signatures, which are different in each part, including such proportions as 1:10, 14:6, 6:5 and 3:7. Larson describes it as 'an intellectual challenge to virtuoso singers',&lt;ref&gt;Larson 2001&lt;/ref&gt; while Watkins suggests that its 'novel and highly mannered proportional complexities ... while appearing theoretical as well as anachronistic, may well be an attempt by the composer to suggest expressive tempo variability'.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins 1991: 228&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The texts ===
The choice of poetry comprises both old and new authors, and the majority of the texts are also set by many other composers. These include four by [[Giambattista Marino]], four by [[Petrarch]] and two by [[Giovanni Battista Guarini]] (plus one other, number 7, which is attributed to Guarini); there are four anonymous poems.

Numbers 6, 8 and 13 are the only settings of their poems recorded in ''Il nuovo Vogel'', while the text of number 15 (discussed above) is set elsewhere only by Francesco Mazza, in his own first book of six-part madrigals published in Venice in 1590. (A slightly different version of the poem was set by Jéhan Gero in the collection published by [[Costanzo Festa]] in 1541 and subsequently in Gero’s own collection of 1543.)

After a long hiatus, Balam Acab self-released his second official album, [https://thebalamacab.bandcamp.com/album/child-death ''CHILD DEATH"], on December 17, 2015&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Strauss, [http://pitchfork.com/news/62605-balam-acab-releases-child-death/ "Balam Acab Releases Child Death"], ''Pitchfork'', December 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; via [[Bandcamp]]. In April 2016, the album was pressed on vinyl and released by the [[DIY]] record label [[Orchid Tapes]].&lt;ref&gt;Warren Hildebrand [http://blog.orchidtapes.com/post/143035490299/so-happy-to-be-releasing-balam-acabs-new-album "So Happy to be Releasing Balam Acab's New Album"], ''Orchid Tapes Blog'', April 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Since the release of CHILD DEATH, Balam Acab has released many singles and collaborations in a variety of styles through [[Soundcloud]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://soundcloud.com/balamacab/ "BALAM ACAB | Free Listening on SoundCloud"], ''Soundcloud''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bandcamp]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://thebalamacab.bandcamp.com/ "Music | BALAM ACAB"], ''Bandcamp''&lt;/ref&gt;

Among numerous side projects and aliases, Balam Acab recently teamed up with producer Goodbye to form the duo hospice_dreams, releasing the debut demo "because i am true". A full release is expected to be released late 2018.

The name "Balam Acab" was taken from a rainbow-creating deity in [[Maya mythology]] that Koone learned about in Spanish class.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="factmag1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2011/02/22/balam-acab-dream-out-loud/2/|title=Balam Acab: dream out loud|publisher=''[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]''|date=February 22, 2011 |accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/night-life/balam-acab|title=Balam Acab|publisher=''[[The New Yorker]]''|date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15762">'''Biopesticides''', a contraction of 'biological [[pesticide]]s', include several types of pest management intervention: through predatory, parasitic, or chemical relationships. The term has been associated historically with [[biological control]] – and by implication – the manipulation of living organisms. Regulatory positions can be influenced by public perceptions, thus:
* in the EU, biopesticides have been defined as "a form of pesticide based on micro-organisms or natural products".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/134na5.pdf Encouraging innovation in biopesticide development.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515143828/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/134na5.pdf |date=May 15, 2012 }} European Commission (2008). Accessed on 20 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the US EPA states that they "include naturally occurring substances that control pests (biochemical pesticides), microorganisms that control pests (microbial pesticides), and pesticidal substances produced by plants containing added genetic material (plant-incorporated protectants) or PIPs".
They are obtained from organisms including plants, bacteria and other microbes, fungi, nematodes, ''etc''.&lt;ref name="Copping2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Leonard G. |last=Copping|title=The Manual of Biocontrol Agents: A World Compendium|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=HLpeSQAACAAJ}}|year=2009|publisher=BCPC|isbn=978-1-901396-17-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Copping2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/biopesticides/  Regulating Biopesticides]. Environmental Protection Agency of the USA (2012). Accessed on 20 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; They are often important components of [[integrated pest management]] (IPM) programmes, and have received much practical attention as substitutes to synthetic chemical plant protection products (PPPs).

== Types ==
Biopesticides can be classified into these classes-
* [[Microbial]] pesticides which consist of bacteria, [[entomopathogenic fungi]] or viruses (and sometimes includes the metabolites that bacteria or fungi produce). Entomopathogenic [[nematode]]s are also often classed as microbial pesticides, even though they are multi-cellular.&lt;ref name="Coombs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coombs|first=Amy|title=Fighting Microbes with Microbes|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/33703/title/Fighting-Microbes-with-Microbes/|work=The Scientist|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://explogrow.com/agri-beneficial-microbes-and-effects-of-organic-bio-fertiliser-on-soil-plant-and-disease|title= Listing 17 microbes and their effects on soil, plant health and biopesticide functions|date=21 January 2017 |publisher=Explogrow, Dr Malherbe, BSc, BSc Hons., MSc, Pr.Sci.Nat.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Borgio J, Sahayaraj K and Alper Susurluk I (eds) .

* Plant-incorporated protectants (PIPs) have genetic material from other species incorporated into their genetic material (''i.e.'' [[GM crop]]s). Their use is controversial, especially in many European countries.&lt;ref&gt;National Pesticide Information Center  Last updated November 21, 2013 [http://npic.orst.edu/reg/pip.html Plant Incorporated Protectants (PIPs) / Genetically Modified Plants]&lt;/ref&gt;
* RNAi pesticides, some of which are topical and some of which are absorbed by the crop.

Biopesticides have usually no known function in photosynthesis, growth or other basic aspects of plant physiology.  Instead, they are active against biological pests. Many chemical compounds have been identified that are produced by plants to [[Plant defense against herbivory|protect them from pests]]. These materials are biodegradable and renewable alternatives, which can be economical for practical use.  [[Organic farming]] systems embraces this approach to pest control.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== RNA ===
[[RNA interference]] is under study for possible use as a spray-on insecticide by multiple companies, including Monsanto, Syngenta, and Bayer. Such sprays do not modify the genome of the target plant. The RNA could be modified to maintain its effectiveness as target species evolve tolerance to the original. RNA is a relatively fragile molecule that generally degrades within days or weeks of application. Monsanto estimated costs to be on the order of $5/acre.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = With BioDirect, Monsanto Hopes RNA Sprays Can Someday Deliver Drought Tolerance and Other Traits to Plants on Demand {{!}} MIT Technology Review|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/540136/the-next-great-gmo-debate|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNAi has been used to target weeds that tolerate Monsanto's [[Glyphosate|Roundup]] herbicide. RNAi mixed with a silicone surfactant that let the RNA molecules enter air-exchange holes in the plant's surface that disrupted the gene for tolerance, affecting it long enough to let the herbicide work. This strategy would allow the continued use of glyphosate-based herbicides, but would not per se assist a herbicide rotation strategy that relied on alternating Roundup with others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

They can be made with enough precision to kill some insect species, while not harming others. Monsanto is also developing an RNA spray to kill [[Colorado potato beetle|potato beetles]] One challenge is to make it linger on the plant for a week, even if it's raining. The Potato beetle has become resistant to more than 60 conventional insecticides.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Monsanto lobbied the U.S. EPA to exempt RNAi pesticide products from any specific regulations (beyond those that apply to all pesticides) and be exempted from rodent toxicity, allergenicity and residual environmental testing. In 2014 an EPA advisory group found little evidence of a risk to people from eating RNA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

However, in 2012, the Australian Safe Food Foundation alleged that the RNA trigger designed to change wheat's starch content might interfere with the gene for a human [[liver enzyme]]. Supporters countered that RNA does not appear to make it past human saliva or stomach acids. The US National Honey Bee Advisory Board told EPA that using RNAi would put natural systems at "the epitome of risk". The beekeepers cautioned that pollinators could be hurt by unintended effects and that the [[genome]]s of many insects are still unknown. Other unassessed risks include ecological (given the need for sustained presence for herbicide and other applications) and the possible for RNA drift across species boundaries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Monsanto has invested in multiple companies for their RNA expertise, including Beeologics (for RNA that kills a parasitic mite that infests hives and for manufacturing technology) and Preceres (nanoparticle lipidoid coatings) and licensed technology from [[Alnylam Pharmaceuticals|Alnylam]] and [[TKM-Ebola|Tekmira]]. In 2012 Syngenta acquired Devgen, a European RNA partner. Startup Forrest Innovations is investigating RNAi as a solution to [[citrus greening disease]] that in 2014 caused 22 percent of oranges in Florida to fall off the trees.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Examples ==
''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'', a bacterial disease of [[Lepidoptera]], [[Coleoptera]] and [[Diptera]], is a well-known insecticide example. The toxin from ''B. thuringiensis'' ([[Bt toxin]]) has been incorporated directly into plants through the use of [[genetic engineering]]. The use of Bt Toxin is particularly controversial. Its manufacturers claim it has little effect on other [[organism]]s, and is more [[environmentally friendly]] than synthetic pesticides.

Other microbial control agents include products based on:
* [[entomopathogenic fungi]] (''e.g. [[Beauveria bassiana]], [[Isaria fumosorosea]], [[Lecanicillium]]'' and ''[[Metarhizium]]'' spp.),
* [[plant disease]] control agents: include ''[[Trichoderma]]'' spp. and ''[[Ampelomyces quisqualis]]'' (a hyper-parasite of grape [[powdery mildew]]); ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' is also used to control plant pathogens.&lt;ref name="Coombs"/&gt;
* beneficial [[nematode]]s attacking insect (''e.g. Steinernema feltiae'') or [[slug]] (''e.g. Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita'') pests
* entomopathogenic [[virus#Applications|viruses]] (''e.g.''. [[Cydia pomonella granulovirus|''Cydia pomonella'' granulovirus]]).
* [[weed]]s and [[rodent]]s have also been controlled with microbial agents.

Various naturally occurring materials, including fungal and plant extracts, have been described as biopesticides. Products in this category include:
* Insect [[pheromone]]s and other [[semiochemical]]s
* Fermentation products such as [[Spinosad]] (a macro-cyclic lactone)
* [[Chitosan]]: a plant in the presence of this product will naturally induce systemic resistance (ISR) to allow the plant to defend itself against disease, pathogens and pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Induction of Systemic Resistance to Fusarium Crown and Root Rot in Tomato Plants by Seed Treatment with Chitosan|date = December 2012|url = http://www.apsnet.org/publications/phytopathology/backissues/Documents/1994Articles/Phyto84n12_1432.pdf|last = Benhamou|last2 = Lafontaine|first = N.|first2 = P.

* Biopesticides may include natural plant-derived products, which include [[alkaloid]]s, [[terpenoid]]s, [[phenolic natural compounds|phenolic]]s and other secondary chemicals. Certain vegetable oils such as [[canola oil]] are known to have pesticidal properties{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Products based on [[Green pesticide|extracts of plants]] such as garlic have now been registered in the EU and elsewhere{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}.

== Applications ==
Biopesticides are [[biological pest control|biological or biologically-derived]] agents, that are usually applied in a manner similar to chemical pesticides, but achieve pest management in an [[environmentally friendly]] way. With all pest management products, but especially microbial agents, effective control requires appropriate [[pesticide formulation|formulation]]&lt;ref&gt;Burges, H.D. (ed.) 1998  ''Formulation of Microbial Biopesticides, beneficial microorganisms, nematodes and seed treatments'' Publ. Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, 412 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[pesticide application|application]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthews GA, Bateman RP, Miller PCH (2014) Pesticide Application Methods (4th Edition), Chapter 16. Wiley, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L Lacey &amp; H Kaya (eds.) (2007) ''Field Manual of Techniques in Invertebrate Pathology'' 2nd edition. Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, NL.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biopesticides for use against crop diseases have already established themselves on a variety of crops. For example, biopesticides already play an important role in controlling downy mildew diseases. Their benefits include: a 0-Day Pre-Harvest Interval (see: [[maximum residue limit]]), the ability to use under moderate to severe disease pressure, and the ability to use as a tank mix or in a rotational program with other registered fungicides. Because some market studies estimate that as much as 20% of global fungicide sales are directed at [[downy mildew]] diseases, the integration of biofungicides into grape production has substantial benefits in terms of extending the useful life of other fungicides, especially those in the reduced-risk category.

A major growth area for biopesticides is in the area of [[seed treatment]]s and [[soil amendment]]s. [[Fungicidal]] and biofungicidal seed treatments are used to control soil borne fungal pathogens that cause seed rots, damping-off, [[root rot]] and seedling blights. They can also be used to control internal seed–borne fungal pathogens as well as fungal pathogens that are on the surface of the seed. Many biofungicidal products also show capacities to stimulate plant host defence and other physiological processes that can make treated crops more resistant to a variety of [[biotic component|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] stresses.

== Disadvantages ==
* High specificity: which may require an exact identification of the pest/pathogen and the use of multiple products to be used; although this can also be an advantage in that the biopesticide is less likely to harm species other than the target
* Often slow speed of action (thus making them unsuitable if a pest outbreak is an immediate threat to a crop)
* Often variable efficacy due to the influences of various biotic and abiotic factors (since some biopesticides are living organisms, which bring about pest/pathogen control by multiplying within or nearby the target pest/pathogen)
* Living organisms evolve and increase their resistance to biological, chemical, physical or any other form of control. If the target population is not exterminated or rendered incapable of reproduction, the surviving population can acquire a tolerance of whatever pressures are brought to bear, resulting in an [[evolutionary arms race]].
* [[Unintended consequences]]: Studies have found broad spectrum biopesticides have lethal and nonlethal risks for non-target native pollinators such as ''[[Melipona quadrifasciata]]'' in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Spinosad in the native stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata: Regrettable non-target toxicity of a bioinsecticide|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653514013563|journal = Chemosphere|date = 2015-04-01|pages = 103–109|volume = 124|doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.11.038|first = Hudson Vaner V.|last = Tomé|first2 = Wagner F.|last2 = Barbosa|first3 = Gustavo F.|last3 = Martins|first4 = Raul Narciso C.|last4 = Guedes|pmid=25496737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2750">'''Brian Manning Delaney''' (born 1965 in [[California]]) is a [[philosopher]], author, and [[translation|translator]], based primarily in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. His ventures include English Proper, a translation company; The Infinite Faculty, an online university, web design firm, and rock band; and Die Grosse Liebe, an exhibition and film based on the principle that [[love]] is "a powerful force" (he and his collaborator, Åsa Elzén, embarked on a world tour in 2003-04 to visit former lovers on several continents).

Delaney is also one of the founding members of the [[Swedish Hegel Society]] (Svenska Hegelsällskapet), and is on the editorial board of ''[[Site Magazine]]''. His articles for ''Site'' have focused on German philosophy as well as on European attitudes towards the U.S.

His and Sven-Olov Wallenstein's Swedish translation of [[Hegel]]'s ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phänomenologie des Geistes]]'' (in Swedish: ''Andens Fenomenologi'') was published in September, 2008. His translation of ''Den andra födan'' (English: ''As a Weasel Sucks Eggs''), by Daniel Birnbaum and [[Anders Olsson (writer)|Anders Olsson]], was published by Sternberg Press in October, 2008.

In April 2009, the [[Swedish Academy]] awarded him a special honor for his work on the translation of the ''Phenomenology of Spirit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/web/Extra_pris_6.aspx |title=Extra Pris |accessdate=2009-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413005546/http://www.svenskaakademien.se/web/Extra_pris_6.aspx |archivedate=2009-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His earliest research was in artificial intelligence, working first with Paul Cohen at the University of Massachusetts, then as an undergraduate with Eugene Charniak at Brown University. &lt;ref&gt;Foreword, The Handbook of Artificial Intelligence, volume III, by Cohen, Paul R; Feigenbaum, Edward A.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work in the Life Extension Movement==

Delaney founded the Usenet group [[sci.life-extension]], and cofounded, with Lisa Walford, Roy Walford, and others, the [[CR Society International]]. He recently co-authored a popular science book on modulating the [[aging]] process, ''[[The Longevity Diet]]''.

'''James Buchanan''' "'''Bucky'''" '''Barnes''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional]] [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Originally introduced as a sidekick to [[Captain America]], the character was created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''[[Captain America Comics]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d March 1941) (which was published by Marvel's [[Timely Comics|predecessor]]) as the original and most well-known incarnation of "'''[[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]]'''".&lt;ref name="milestone"&gt;The 1995 ''Marvel Milestone Edition: Captain America'' archival reprint has no [[cover date]] or number, and its postal [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]] says, "Originally published ... as Captain America #000". Timely's first comic, ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' #1, likewise had no number on its cover, and was released with two different cover dates.&lt;/ref&gt; The character is [[comic book death|brought back from supposed death]] as the brainwashed assassin '''Winter Soldier''' ({{lang-ru|Зимний Солдат}}, [[Romanization of Russian|translit.]] ''Zimniy Soldát''; Belarusian: Зімовы Салдат translit. Zimovy Saldat; Uzbek: Qish Askari translit. Kish Askari), and later assumed the role of '''[[List of incarnations of Captain America|Captain America]]''' when [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] was presumed to be dead.

[[IGN]] listed Bucky Barnes as the 53rd greatest comic book hero of all time stating that after [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], Bucky is easily the most iconic superhero sidekick of the Golden Age and describing him as one of the central players in the Marvel Universe since his role of being Captain America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/53 | title=Bucky Barnes is number 53 | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN also lists Bucky as #8 in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers" in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |date=April 30, 2012 |title=The Top 50 Avengers |url=http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/8 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sebastian Stan]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'', ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.

==Publication history==
When [[Joe Simon]] created his initial sketch of [[Captain America]] for Marvel Comics precursor [[Timely Comics]] in 1940, he included a young sidekick. "The boy companion was simply named Bucky, after my friend Bucky Pierson, a star on our high school basketball team," Simon said in his autobiography.&lt;ref name=joesimonp50&gt;Simon, Joe, with Jim Simon. ''The Comic Book Makers'' (Crestwood/II, 1990), p. 50. {{ISBN|1-887591-35-4}}. Reissued (Vanguard Productions, 2003) {{ISBN|1-887591-35-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the character's debut in ''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941), Bucky Barnes appeared alongside the title star in virtually every story in that publication and other Timely series, and was additionally part of the all-kid team the [[Young Allies]]. In the post-war era, with the popularity of superheroes fading, Bucky appeared alongside team-leader Captain America in the two published adventures of Timely/Marvel's first superhero group, the [[All-Winners Squad]], in ''[[All Winners Comics]]'' #19 and 21 (Fall-Winter 1946; there was no issue #20). After Bucky was shot and seriously wounded in a 1948 ''Captain America'' story, he was succeeded by Captain America's girlfriend Betsy Ross, who became the superhero [[Golden Girl (Timely Comics)|Golden Girl]]. ''Captain America Comics'' ended with #75 (Feb. 1950), by which time the series had been titled ''Captain America's Weird Tales'' for two issues, with the finale a horror/suspense anthology issue with no superheroes.

Captain America and Bucky were both briefly revived, along with fellow Timely stars the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]] and the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]], in the omnibus ''Young Men'' #24 (Dec. 1953), published by Marvel's 1950s iteration [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]. Bucky appeared alongside "Captain America, Commie Smasher!",&lt;!--note: This is a cover nickname on all his 1950s comics, and presented in all caps like "Daredevil, The Man Without Fear". And in any case, "Commie," short for "Communist," a proper noun, is always capped--&gt; as the hero was cover-billed, in stories published during the next year in ''Young Men'' and ''Men's Adventures'', as well as in three issues of ''Captain America'' that continued the old numbering. Sales were poor, however, and the series was discontinued with ''Captain America'' #78 (Sept. 1954).

[[Retroactive continuity]], beginning with ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #4 (March 1964), established that the original Captain America and Bucky went missing near the end of World War II and were secretly replaced by then-[[U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] with successor heroes using those identities.

Bucky appeared in very occasional [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s from the 1960s on, and co-starred with Captain America in flashback World War II adventures in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #63-71 (March-Nov. 1965). His apparent death was depicted in flashback in ''The Avengers'' #56 (Sept. 1968).

In 2005, series writer [[Ed Brubaker]] returned Bucky from his seeming death near the end of World War II. He additionally revealed that Barnes's official status as Captain America's sidekick was a cover-up, and that Barnes began as a 16-year-old operative trained to do things regular soldiers and the twenty-something Captain America normally would not do, such as conduct covert assassinations.

Bucky's death had been notable as one of the few [[comic book death]]s that remained unreversed. An [[aphorism]] among comic book fans, known as the Bucky Clause, was that in comics, "No one stays dead except Bucky, [[Jason Todd]] and [[Uncle Ben]]".&lt;ref&gt;Archive of Jonathan V. Last (2007-03-13). [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930190328/http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110009780 "Captain America, RIP"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', March 13, 2007. Retrieved November 10, 2010. [http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110009780 Original page]&lt;/ref&gt; However, all three were brought back to life in their respective universes in 2006, although Uncle Ben turned out to be an alternate Ben from another reality.

Bucky's death has also been used to explain why the Marvel Universe has virtually no young sidekicks, as no responsible hero wants to endanger a minor in similar fashion. [[Stan Lee]] also disliked the plot device of kid sidekicks, saying in the 1970s that "One of my many pet peeves has always been the young teenage sidekick of the average superhero".&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Stan, ''Origins of Marvel Comics'' ([[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1974; Marvel Entertainment Group, 1997 reissue, {{ISBN|0-7851-0551-4}}), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Stern]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] had also considered bringing Bucky back, before deciding against it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&amp;T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#16 Byrne Robotics: "Frequently Asked Questions]: Questions about Comic Book Projects: "Captain America: Did JB ever consider bringing Bucky back?"&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1990, co-creator Jack Kirby, when asked if he had ever heard talk of resurrecting Bucky, answered: "Speaking completely for myself, I wouldn't mind bringing Bucky in; he represents teenagers, and there are always teenagers; he's a universal character".&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Age'' #95 (Dec. 1990): "Birth of a Legend: Jack Kirby Talks about Captain America"&lt;/ref&gt;

A climactic scene of Bucky's return involves Captain America using the reality-altering Cosmic Cube to restore the Winter Soldier's memories. Writer Ed Brubaker, in an interview, said he intended no loophole, and that Captain America did not "will" the Winter Soldier to have Bucky's memories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=b58bf0b3f4ac23ca6c67b76bfc0cf995&amp;threadid=58008 ''Newsarama'' (Feb. 2, 2006): "Spoiler Sport: Ed Brubaker on the Winter Soldier", by Matt Brady]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}
{{quote|'''''Newsarama''''': But playing devil’s advocate—asking the Cosmic Cube to help you is very "monkey's paw" at best ... the Winter Soldier could have been, in reality, someone named Comrade Pitor Nikoli, created just to demoralize Cap, but with him wishing it to be so with the Cube, couldn't Cap just have willed the Winter Soldier to be Bucky, and so he was?}}

{{quote|'''''Brubaker''''': That wasn't how I looked at it. Look at what he said—"Remember who you are". He didn't say, "Become who I think you are". Or, "Be Bucky". It was very straightforward. Which is more the tragedy, since Bucky immediately has this immense guilt for everything he did as the Winter Soldier.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Captain America, he appeared as a regular character in the 2010-2013 ''Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through issue #7 (January 2011), and in issue #12.1 (June 2011). After the events of the 2011 "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, Bucky returned to the role of Winter Soldier, this time as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent in an eponymous series that lasted 19 issues. The first 14 issues were written by Brubaker, with the last story arc written by [[Jason Latour]]. Since January 2014, Bucky has been part of the cast of [[James Robinson (comics)|James Robinson]]'s ''[[All-New Invaders]].''

{{out of date|date=November 2018}} In July 2014, it was announced that Bucky would again have his own series, titled ''Bucky Barnes: The Winter Soldier''. The series is written by Ales Kot with art by Marco Rudy, and began in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;''Bucky Barnes: The Winter Soldier'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin and World War II===
[[File:Bucky.PNG|thumb|upright|Bucky in World War II. Cover detail for ''Captain America 65th Anniversary Special'' (May 2006). Art by [[Eric Wight]].]]
James Buchanan Barnes was born in [[Shelbyville, Indiana]] in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' v.5 #50&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes grew up as an [[Army brat]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://68.media.tumblr.com/9505ab134fe4605fd42106027ec5c279/tumblr_nnajfm5nPx1u7d9u7o1_500.jpg ''Original Sin'' #1] (2014), [[Marvel Comics]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was orphaned when his father was killed in training at U.S. Army Camp Lehigh in Virginia just before the United States' entry into [[World War II]]. As a result, he is unofficially adopted by the camp as a mascot. Nicknamed "Bucky", he takes to wearing a uniform and becoming savvy with the ins and outs of military life, even though he is a teenager. It was at Lehigh that he meets and befriends Private Steven Rogers, who by all appearances is the clumsiest soldier in the camp. This was at the same time that reports of the then-mysterious [[Captain America]] begin to appear in news magazines, and Barnes eagerly devours the accounts of this new hero.

In 1940, Bucky accidentally walked in on Steve Rogers changing into his uniform, thus discovering his friend was Captain America and insisted that he join him. He underwent extensive training and was assigned to be Captain America's partner. The military justified putting a 15-year-old in harm's way by using him as a symbol to rally the youth of America (as revealed in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' vol. 5, #12, Dec 2005). They fight the [[Red Skull]] together, and Captain America accepts Bucky as his partner.&lt;ref&gt;''Adventures of Captain America'' #3-4&lt;/ref&gt; Together, Captain America and Bucky fight [[Nazism|Nazis]] both at home and abroad, as a duo and as part of the superhero team known as the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]], fighting [[Master Man (Marvel Comics)|Master Man]] in their first mission.&lt;ref&gt;''Giant-Size Invaders'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes also teams up with the sidekicks of other heroes in a group called the [[Young Allies]]. Additionally, Bucky was [[retconned]] in 1976 as the organizer of the [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]] [[World War II]] super-team the [[Liberty Legion]], set between the formations of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] and the post-war [[All-Winners Squad]]. He was also briefly one of the [[Kid Commandos]] at this time. Bucky served as an advance scout for Captain America and the Invaders, often being assigned tasks that none of the heroes could be seen doing.

In the closing days of World War II in 1945, Captain America and Bucky tried to stop the villainous [[Baron Zemo]] from destroying an experimental [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone plane]]. Zemo launches the plane with an armed explosive device on it, with Rogers and Barnes in hot pursuit. They reach the plane just before it takes off. Bucky unsuccessfully tries to defuse the bomb, and it explodes in mid-air before reaching its intended target. He will be believed to have been killed in action, as Rogers is hurled into the freezing waters of the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;depicted in ''Avengers'' #56&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers' body, preserved in [[suspended animation]] in a block of ice, is found decades later by [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] while searching the Arctic for the Sub-Mariner.&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' #4 (March 1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only in modern times that Captain America would learn that Bucky had a sister, Rebecca, whom he met at a veterans Christmas celebration.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Holiday Special'' Vol. 1 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Bucky also had one notable post-mortem appearance when the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] challenged the West and East Coast [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for the destruction of the universe, apparently resurrecting [[Legion of the Unliving|long-dead friends and foes]] for them to fight. Captain America battled Bucky, whom he defeated, and the apparitions disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers West Coast'' #2; ''Avengers Annual'' #16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Winter Soldier===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Captain America]] --&gt;
In 2005, Marvel launched a new ''Captain America'' series (Volume 5) with writer [[Ed Brubaker]], who revealed that Bucky did not die in World War II. It was revealed that after the plane exploded, General Vasily Karpov and the crew of a Russian patrol submarine found Bucky's cold-preserved body, albeit with his left arm severed. Bucky was revived in Moscow, but suffered brain damage with [[amnesia]] as a result of the explosion. Scientists attached a [[bionic arm]], periodically upgrading it as technology improved.

Programmed to be a Soviet assassin for Department X – under the code name the Winter Soldier, he is sent on covert [[wetwork]] missions and becomes increasingly ruthless and efficient as he kills in the name of the state. While a Soviet agent, he also has a brief relationship with the Black Widow. The Winter Soldier is kept in a cryogenic stasis when not on missions, and as a result has aged only a few years to a young adult since the closing days of World War II. In 1968, the Winter Soldier was sent to kill Professor Zhang Chin, whom he had met over 20 years earlier. He was thwarted by an intangible being called the Man with No Face, though he was able to escape.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' (v.5) #45. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; On assignment in the [[United States]] in the 1970s, he suffers a breakdown and goes missing for days after [[assassination|assassinating]] his target.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' (v.5) #11. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; The Winter Soldier also aided in [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s escape from the Weapon X laboratory and later murdered [[Itsu (comics)|Itsu]], Wolverine's wife, seemingly killing their unborn son [[Daken]], who survived the attack after being cut from his mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' (v.3) #40. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present day, the Winter Soldier seemingly kills the [[Red Skull]] and Jack Monroe (Nomad) under orders from former Soviet general [[Aleksander Lukin]] (Karpov's former protégé). The Winter Soldier launches a terrorist attack on [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], killing hundreds, and charges the [[Cosmic Cube]] which Lukin sent him to retrieve. He kidnaps [[Sharon Carter]], an agent of the international espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and a former lover of Steve Rogers (Captain America). Upon her rescue, Carter tells Captain America that Winter Soldier looked like Bucky. S.H.I.E.L.D. chief [[Nick Fury]] confirms the Winter Soldier's existence, but cannot ascertain his identity.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' (v.5) #1-6. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain America tracks down and confronts the Winter Soldier. Regaining his memories, Bucky becomes overwhelmed by guilt over his past actions, crushing the Cosmic Cube and teleporting away.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' (v.5) #14. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

He reappears shortly afterward in [[London, England]], where he helps Captain America fend off a terrorist attack. He asks Nick Fury for employment and new equipment following the loss of his bionic arm.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' (v.5) #18-21. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the events of the superhuman [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]], Winter Soldier helps Fury plan the escape of an arrested Steve Rogers. Before the plan can be implemented, however, Rogers is assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #25. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering registration architect [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] (Iron Man) as ultimately responsible, Winter Soldier plans to kill Stark in revenge. Deducing that Stark will oversee the appointment of a new Captain America, Winter Soldier steals Captain America's shield from S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] so that it cannot be handed down.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' (v.5) #27. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, he heads to Kronas's headquarters, where Lukin reveals he is the Red Skull and has the evil psychiatrist [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Dr. Faustus]] attempt unsuccessfully to brainwash the Winter Soldier.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' (v.5) #31. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The new Captain America===
[[Image:Cap 34.jpg|thumb|left|Bucky Barnes as Captain America. Art by [[Alex Ross]]]]
{{See also|The Death of Captain America}}
After escaping from Faustus and being captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Barnes learns from Executive Director [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] that Steve Rogers had left Stark a letter asking Stark to watch over Barnes and that the Captain America mantle should continue.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #30 (Sept. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Stark suggests that Barnes become the new Captain America. Barnes agrees to become the new Captain America only if Stark has telepaths eliminate any potential subliminal commands and guarantees him complete autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #33 (Dec. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; As the autonomy arrangement is illegal under the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], Stark keeps his support of the new Captain America secret. Barnes's new Captain America costume is laced with adamantium, and he carries a pistol and a combat knife.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' vol. 5, #34 (March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes' first major adventure as the new Captain America has him, Falcon, Carter and S.H.I.E.L.D. fighting against the original Red Skull and Dr. Faustus who have revived the [[William Burnside (comics)|1950s Captain America]] in a plot to secure one of their pawns attaining the U.S. presidency. Barnes and his allies succeed in aborting the Skull's plans, and Barnes saves the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates from assassination, winning public applause. The adventure ends with Barnes accepting himself and addressing himself now as Captain America.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' (Vol 5) #35-42&lt;/ref&gt; He also begins a friendship with Black Widow.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' (Vol 5) #42&lt;/ref&gt;

A still-teenaged Barnes is transported from 1941 and appears in the 2008 ''Avengers/Invaders'' miniseries alongside his fellow Invaders when a [[time travel]] incident takes them from a [[World War II]] battlefield to the present-day [[Marvel Universe]], where they encounter both the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] and [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]. At the conclusion of ''Avengers/Invaders'' #4, while attempting to break out of the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, which he believes to be a German base, Barnes encounters his future self dressed as Captain America.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers/Invaders'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; During this meeting, the future Barnes attempts to change his history by telling his past self to abandon the plane that he was seemingly killed trying to disarm, without ever telling his younger self his true identity.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers/Invaders'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes decides to let his life turn out the way it should after witnessing the devastating risks involved in changing history.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers/Invaders'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, after most of the other heroes have fallen as the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion of Earth]] continues, Captain America is seen watching [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] defend a group of civilians in [[Central Park]].&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Invasion'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; Later, after a brief confrontation with Thor, he joins the other group of heroes (the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]], the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], the [[Initiative (comics)|Initiative]], the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], [[Nick Fury]] and his [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]], [[Young Avengers]], and the [[Hood (comics)|Hood's]] group) in battle against an army of Super-Skrulls led by Queen [[Veranke]] herself.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Invasion'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the ''Secret Invasion'' storyline, Captain America discovers that the remains of Jim Hammond, the [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]], have been recovered and studied by the [[United Nations]]. The body was stolen by Professor Zhang Chin who used the Torch to create a virus to exterminate half the Earth's population. Teaming up with Namor, they stop Chin and make sure that Hammond receives a proper burial.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #43-48&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of ''Secret Invasion'', Captain America joins the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] and offers his home as a base of operations. He later participates in the search for [[Luke Cage]] and [[Jessica Jones]]' child, Danielle.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #48&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered a possible team leader but turned it down because he did not have the proper team experience.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #51&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Captain America: Reborn]]'' storyline, Barnes finds out from Sharon that she did not really kill Steve Rogers. As explained by [[Arnim Zola|Doctor Zola]] to [[Norman Osborn]], Rogers was trapped in a fixed position of time and space. But since Sharon ruined the machine that was supposed to bring him back, Steve was reliving his own past. Barnes and Black Widow attempt to steal the device from [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] but are captured. Osborn sends the Black Widow back to Sharon with an ultimatum: either she turns herself in, as Osborn had implicated her as Rogers' second shooter, or he'll kill Barnes. Barnes is then sent into the custody of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] who tell him that he'll be inducted into their group once Rogers is brought back. However, Barnes is secretly freed by [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Ant-Man]] and then rescued by the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America: Reborn #1-3&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes then teams up with [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]], [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff]], the Falcon, [[Hank Pym]], and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] to save Sharon. The group intercepts the Red Skull's ship beside the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and attacks. The Red Skull has already taken over Steve's body, and Barnes attacks him. The two battle while Hank saves Sharon and the others battle [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and a squad of [[MODOK|M.O.D.O.K.S.]]. [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] shoots Barnes in the shoulders, giving the Skull the opportunity to take Captain America's shield. He pins Barnes to the ground and cuts off his cybernetic hand with the shield. However, inside Steve's mind, Steve prepares to kill the Red Skull to keep him from doing any more evil in his name. Realizing its peril, the Red Skull's consciousness returns to its own robotic body. As the robotic Skull attempts to flee, Sharon shoots him, causing the Skull's body to become giant-sized. Steve, back in control of himself, leads an attack. The Vision uses the Skull's ship's weapons to destroy the Skull.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

Leading up to the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline, Bucky Barnes is shown still as Captain America talking with Steve Rogers in a dark body suit and standing next to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers Annual'' #. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; But Rogers is back in costume and seen alongside Barnes still in his own Captain America costume. The two are helping restore Tony Stark's mind by using the shield as a conduit for Thor's lightning.&lt;ref&gt;''Invincible Iron Man'' #21. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second issue, Barnes is alongside Steve's team of heroes. Barnes (still in his Captain America suit) pulls Rogers aside just before they are about to leave for [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. Barnes tells Rogers that they should "skip the argument" and insists that Rogers use Captain America's shield.

===''Fear Itself'' and return as Winter Soldier===

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Barnes takes up the Captain America identity again, but is [[Comic book death|apparently killed]] in battle with [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] (in her [[Skadi]] form).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic |writer=Matt Fraction |penciller=Stuart Immonen |inker=Wade von Grawbadger|story=The Hammer that Fell on Yancy Street|title=Fear Itself |volume=1 |issue=3 |date=August 2011 |publisher=Marvel Comics |page=|panel=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He survives after being injected with a dose of the Infinity Formula. With the world believing him dead he returned to his former identity of Winter Soldier to perform special jobs behind the scenes relating to his earlier days as the Winter Soldier. Only Rogers, Nick Fury, and Black Widow know the truth of his "death".&lt;ref&gt;''Fear Itself'' #7.1. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Winter Soldier'' #1. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Bucky and Natasha then pursue sleeper agents trained by Bucky during his Winter Soldier days,&lt;ref&gt;''Winter Soldier'' #1-14&lt;/ref&gt; awakened recently by an unknown ex-[[KGB]] agent, who turns out to be Ivan Kragoff, the [[Red Ghost]] and former prime minister of Latveria [[Lucia von Bardas]].&lt;ref&gt;''Winter Soldier'' #14–19&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]'' storyline, Bucky initially participates in the investigation into the death of [[Uatu]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]], travelling into deep space with [[Moon Knight]] and [[Gamora]] to follow up a lead.&lt;ref&gt;''Original Sin'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Orb (comics)|Orb]] uses one of the Watcher's eyes to force the heroes in its vicinity to witness their deepest secrets, he returns to Earth after destroying the shuttle to strand his teammates, brutally attacking Nick Fury (actually a Life Model Decoy) as he proclaims that there will be "No more secrets".&lt;ref&gt;''Original Sin'' #3. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Following the revelation that Nick Fury has been secretly protecting Earth from various alien threats for years using more brutal methods than the heroes would have condoned,&lt;ref&gt;''Original Sin'' #5. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the revelation that he killed the Watcher in self-defense and used the Watcher's eye to find the identity of his attacker when Uatu refused to break his oath and reveal that information himself, Fury now acts as the Watcher's replacement while Bucky takes over Fury's role as Earth's more ruthless guardian.&lt;ref&gt;''Original Sin'' #8. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Bucky, upon being alerted of a catastrophic event, returns to Earth and traces the source of the event to a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] facility where he fights off the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents there. He leaves a trail for Steve Rogers, who finds a message on a napkin he used. At Bev's Diner, Steve Rogers meets with Winter Soldier where they learn that S.H.I.E.L.D. never discarded the Kobik project as they believed, which Whisperer (an alias of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]) made it public.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha!'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; He then meets Sam Wilson, the current [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]], who received a tip from the Whisperer about Pleasant Hill and Kobik. After rescuing S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Avril Kancaid from the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]] at the Day Care Center, they are informed of a super weapon hidden in town that [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] and the other villains are looking for. They later find Steve Rogers at the bowling alley restored to his prime, after Kobik used her powers to restore his youth when he was about to be killed by [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]]. They begin to search for Kobik again only to discover that Baron Zemo had [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] invent a device that would help find Kobik as [[Kraven the Hunter]] rallies the villains to help with their goals. Upon not being able to successfully locate Kobik, Steve decides to rally the heroes so they can take the fight to Baron Zemo.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #7–8&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the incident, Winter Soldier is approached by Kobik, who offers to help him do good. Winter Soldier agrees to the terms as Kobik suggests that she brings some "friends" she made in Pleasant Hill with them.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Omega'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Baron Helmut Zemo uses Kobik to send Winter Soldier back in time to World War II. However, Zemo has other plans on Winter Soldier, deciding to tie him onto the rocket to be killed in its explosion.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 3 #12&lt;/ref&gt; Before being launched, Winter Soldier is shocked to see the Steve he saw besides Zemo is not the man he once knew.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Empire'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; However, Winter Soldier manages to escape and fall into the ocean, where he is found by the Atlantean army led by Namor, and is offered to disguise himself as the king's bodyguard to cover his tracks. Once Sam Wilson returns as Captain America and gives hope to his fellow heroes to find the Cosmic Cube fragments before Hydra does, Namor told Winter Soldier that the time has come to remove his disguise and help their fellow allies.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' Vol. 8 #25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Empire'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; During the resistances' preparation for the final battle against Hydra and returning the real Steve Rogers back, Winter Soldier reveals that he knew whom Kobik was aside being a manifested sentient of Cosmic Cube, a misguided child whom Hydra manipulated into replacing the real Steve with a Hydra counterpart. Thus, Winter Soldier devices a distraction plan by needing Ant-Man/Scott Lang and Sam's help to get Kobik and their Steve back, while Hawkeye leads the rest of resistance on their final raids on the Hydra army at their main base, located in Washington, DC. During the heroes' final raid against Hydra, Winter Soldier rescues Black Panther, who was captured by Hydra and they apprehend Zemo together. When Zola equips Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers with a modified stolen Iron Man armor, infused with the 90% fragments of Cosmic Cube, and both altering the reality into Hydra's image and erasing the heroes from their existence, Winter Soldier, Ant-Man and Sam Wilson uses the last fragment to defend themselves, and initiate their plans, by pretending to surrender the last fragment to Hydra Steve, for Ant-Man and Winter Soldier to enter the cube inside. Once entering the cube thanks to Ant-Man, and Sam's distraction, Winter Soldier manages to save both Kobik and Steve Rogers, restoring the reality and restoring both Steve's physical appearance on the surface, as well as wearing his iconic Captain America costume, and his Super Soldier serum powers. Winter Soldier wanted to help his friend defeating his evil Hydra counterpart, but Sam told him to stand down and let Captain America do this alone.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Empire'' #9–10&lt;/ref&gt; After Captain America defeated his counterpart, and eventually Hydra, Winter Soldier went to Madripoor while still mourning over Black Widow's death, who was killed by Hydra Supreme Rogers, watching her funeral on TV as he is currently on the lead of an infamous general, who is the target of assassination. [[Yelena Belova|Someone]] snipes the general and Winter Soldier suspects that it might be Black Widow.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Empire Omega''&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bucky has doubt that the last Black Widow he saw is not Natasha, but an impostor. He is soon joined by Hawkeye in the search for Natasha's impostor who they discover to be [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Yelena Belova]], who temporarily replaced Natasha as the Black Widow ten years prior.&lt;ref&gt;''Tales of Suspense'' #100–101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Having trained under Steve Rogers (the original Captain America in World War II) and others in the time leading up to World War II, "Bucky" Barnes is a master of hand-to-hand combat and martial arts, as well as being skilled in the use of military weapons such as firearms and grenades. He also used throwing knives on occasion and was a gifted advance scout. His time as the covert Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier helped to further hone his skills, making him the equal to his predecessor in combat skills and an expert assassin and spy. He is also fluent in many languages, including English, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Russian, Latin, and Japanese.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He can understand French.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' vol. 5, #43. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Winter Soldier's left arm is a cybernetic prosthetic with superhuman strength and enhanced reaction time. The arm can function when not in contact with Barnes and can discharge an EMP causing electronics to either shut down or become useless. The use of Barnes' EMP is shown when Barnes uses it to shut down a Nick Fury [[Life Model Decoy|LMD]] and when he attempts to use it on Iron Man. The arm has a holographic function to disguise it as a flesh and blood arm.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

As Captain America, he possesses the original, indestructible, vibranium alloy shield used by his predecessor, as well as a [[Kevlar]]/[[Nomex]] blend shock-absorbing costume. He often carries several conventional weapons such as knives, guns—mostly a Colt 1911A1 .45 and a [[Luger P08 pistol|P08 Luger]]—and grenades.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Other versions==
In the [[DC Comics]]/[[Marvel Comics]] [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[intercompany crossover]] ''Batman/Captain America'' (Dec. 1996), written and drawn by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and set during [[World War II]], Bucky briefly takes [[Dick Grayson|Robin's]] place as [[Batman|Batman's]] sidekick, while Robin becomes Captain America's sidekick. In this [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] (set in one of DC Comics' numerous "[[Elseworlds]]" continuities), Bucky dies (off-page) as he had done in numerous ''Avengers'' and ''Captain America'' recollections.

In the alternate reality of the five-issue ''[[Bullet Points (comics)|Bullet Points]]'' miniseries (Jan.-May 2005), James Barnes never teams up with Steve Rogers as the Super-Soldier program was never activated. However, Rogers volunteers for the 'Iron Man' program and as such, saves Barnes and several fellow soldiers from an advancing tank during the battle of Guadalcanal. Unfortunately he is not swift enough to save Barnes from severe damage to his legs.

In the [[House of M]] reality, James Buchanan Barnes is one of the United States government agents (alongside [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] and [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]]) sent to Genosha to kill Magneto and as many of his followers as possible. Nuke and Mimic served as a distraction while Agent Barnes sneaked into Magneto's headquarters;&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War: House of M'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; and though he fatally stabs Professor Xavier, Bucky was killed by Magneto.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War: House of M'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second issue of the crossover miniseries ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'', a zombified Winter Soldier appears and attempts to devour [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]]. This version of the Winter Soldier is ultimately killed by [[Ash Williams]], who shoots his head off with his "[[shotgun|boomstick]]", even having shot off his bionic arm.

The [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Bucky Barnes is an adult sidekick of [[Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]] (Steve Rogers). This version is Steve's childhood friend who accompanies on missions as an [[War photography|Army press photographer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimates #1''&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving the war and believing Captain America's death, Bucky eventually marries Gail Richards and has a large extended family. During which, Bucky is diagnosed as having [[lung cancer]] from [[chain smoking]] back in the War. Barnes and Gail both live to see Steve's revival in the 21st century and renews their friendship. After America was taken by the Liberators, Bucky is captured at a cemetery with Steve and remains unseen.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimates 2 #9''&lt;/ref&gt; However, both he and Gail are seen being taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. protective custody after it is discovered that the [[Red Skull]] is Steve's and Gail's illegitimate son.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics: Avengers #2''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] [[Marvel MAX]] series ''[[War Machine#U.S. War Machine|U.S. War Machine]]'', Bucky was serving in the present as [[Captain America]], as the Captain had died in his stead in World War II. Bucky was accompanied here by [[Hawkeye (comics)|two]] [[Falcon (comics)|assistants]] that are both addressed by their real names.

In the 2005 ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' event, the Captain America story, set during the American Civil War, featured Steve Rogers' commanding officer, Colonel Buck Barnes, whom the men called "Bucky". His mercenary tendencies led to Rogers' desertion, and when he later intervened in Rogers' transformation into Captain America, his face was destroyed, turning him into an undead being known as the White Skull.

In ''Ruins'', which is set in a dystopian alternate future, Bucky is taken into custody alongside Victor Creed and others for several heinous crimes, including cannibalism.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

An alternate-universe Bucky appears in the 2011 miniseries ''Captain America Corps''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/117/1175095p1.html |title=''Captain America Corps'' #1 Exclusive Preview|date= June 9, 2011 | first=Joey| last= Esposito|publisher=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a world where all the Marvel characters are small children depicted in ''A-Babies vs. X-Babies'', Bucky is Steve's teddy bear, named Bucky Bear. He is stolen by Scott Summers, igniting an enormous battle between the baby Avengers and the baby X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''A-Babies vs. X-Babies'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Bucky (as a teenager) will appear as a member of the Battleworld [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]] during "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marvel Announces Runaways - A New Secret Wars Series|first=Jamie|last=Lovett|date=27 February 2015|work=ComicBook.com|url=http://comicbook.com/2015/02/27/marvel-announces-runaways---a-new-secret-wars-series/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Calvin Coolidge Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|uː|l|ɪ|dʒ}}; July 4, 1872 – January 5, 1933) was an American politician and the 30th [[President of the United States]] (1923–1929). A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] lawyer from [[New England]], born in [[Vermont]], Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of [[Massachusetts]] state [[politics]], eventually becoming [[Governor of Massachusetts|governor]]. His response to the [[Boston Police Strike]] of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action. Soon after, he was elected [[Vice President of the United States]] in 1920, and succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1923. Elected in his own right in [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924]], he gained a reputation as a [[small government]] [[conservative]] and also as a man who said very little, although having a rather dry sense of humor.

Coolidge restored public confidence in the [[White House]] after the [[Warren G. Harding#Scandals|scandals]] of his predecessor's administration, and left office with considerable popularity.{{sfnm|McCoy|1967|1pp=420–21|Greenberg|2006|2pp=49–53}} As a Coolidge biographer wrote: "He embodied the spirit and hopes of the [[middle class]], could interpret their longings and express their opinions. That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength".{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=500}}

Mainstream scholars have ranked Coolidge [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States#Scholar survey results|as a below-average president]]. He is praised by advocates of smaller government and ''[[laissez-faire]]'', while supporters of an active central government generally view him less favorably, though most praise his stalwart support of racial equality.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1pp=12–13|Greenberg|2006|2pp=1–7}}

==Birth and family history==
[[File:CoolidgeAmherst.png|thumb|upright|left|Coolidge as an Amherst College undergraduate]]
John Calvin Coolidge Jr. was born in [[Plymouth, Vermont|Plymouth Notch]], [[Windsor County, Vermont|Windsor County]], [[Vermont]], on July 4, 1872, the only U.S. president to be born on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]. He was the elder of the two children of [[John Calvin Coolidge Sr.]] (1845–1926) and Victoria Josephine Moor (1846–1885). Coolidge Senior engaged in many occupations and developed a statewide reputation as a prosperous farmer, storekeeper, and public servant. He held various local offices, including [[justice of the peace]] and tax collector and served in the Vermont House of Representatives as well as the Vermont Senate.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=22}} Coolidge's mother was the daughter of a Plymouth Notch farmer. She was chronically ill and died, perhaps from [[tuberculosis]], when Coolidge was twelve years old. His younger sister, Abigail Grace Coolidge (1875–1890), died at the age of fifteen, probably of appendicitis, when Coolidge was eighteen. Coolidge's father married a Plymouth schoolteacher in 1891, and lived to the age of eighty.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1p=17|McCoy|1967|2p=5|White|1938|3p=11}}

Coolidge's family had deep roots in [[New England]]; his earliest American ancestor, John Coolidge, emigrated from [[Cottenham]], Cambridgeshire, England, around 1630 and settled in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=12}} Another ancestor, [[Edmund Rice (1638)|Edmund Rice]], arrived at Watertown in 1638. Coolidge's great-great-grandfather, also named John Coolidge, was an American military officer in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and one of the first [[Board of Selectmen|selectmen]] of the town of Plymouth.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=7}} His grandfather [[Calvin Galusha Coolidge]] served in the Vermont House of Representatives.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=24}} Coolidge was also a descendant of [[Samuel Appleton (born 1625)|Samuel Appleton]], who settled in [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]] and led the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] during [[King Philip's War]].{{sfn|Roberts|1995|p=199}}

==Early career and marriage==

===Education and law practice===
[[File:Prof. Charles E. Garman - Amherst College.jpg|thumb|upright|Amherst College Philosophy Dept. Picture|Professor [[Charles Edward Garman]]]]

Coolidge attended [[Black River Academy]] and then [[St. Johnsbury Academy]], before enrolling at [[Amherst College]], where he distinguished himself in the debating class. As a senior he joined the fraternity [[Phi Gamma Delta]] and graduated ''cum laude''. While at Amherst Coolidge was profoundly influenced by philosophy professor [[Charles Edward Garman]], a [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] mystic, with a [[Neo-Hegelianism|neo-Hegelian]] philosophy.

Coolidge explained Garman's ethics forty years later:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]here is a standard of righteousness that might does not make right, that the end does not justify the means, and that expediency as a working principle is bound to fail. The only hope of perfecting human relationships is in accordance with the law of service under which men are not so solicitous about what they shall get as they are about what they shall give. Yet people are entitled to the rewards of their industry. What they earn is theirs, no matter how small or how great. But the possession of property carries the obligation to use it in a larger service...{{sfn|White|1938|pp=43–44}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At his father's urging after graduation, Coolidge moved to [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] to become a lawyer. To avoid the cost of [[law school]], Coolidge followed the common practice of apprenticing with a local law firm, Hammond &amp; Field, and [[reading law]] with them. [[John C Hammond|John C. Hammond]] and Henry P. Field, both Amherst graduates, introduced Coolidge to law practice in the county seat of [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]]. In 1897, Coolidge was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, becoming a [[country lawyer]].{{sfn|Shlaes|2013|pp=66–68}} With his savings and a small inheritance from his grandfather, Coolidge opened his own law office in Northampton in 1898. He practiced commercial law, believing that he served his clients best by staying out of court. As his reputation as a hard-working and diligent attorney grew, local banks and other businesses began to retain his services.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1pp=74–81|McCoy|1967|2pp=22–26}}

===Marriage and family===
[[File:Grace Coolidge.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Grace Coolidge]]]]
In 1903, Coolidge met [[Grace Coolidge|Grace Anna Goodhue]], a [[University of Vermont]] graduate and teacher at Northampton's [[Clarke School for the Deaf]]. They married on October 4, 1905 at 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. in a small ceremony which took place in the parlor of Grace's family's house, following a vain effort at postponement by Grace's mother; she was never enamored with Coolidge, nor he with her.{{sfn|Bryson|2013|p=187}} The newlyweds went on a honeymoon trip to Montreal, originally planned for two weeks but cut short by a week at Coolidge's request. After 25 years he wrote of Grace, "for almost a quarter of a century she has borne with my infirmities and I have rejoiced in her graces".{{sfn|White|1938|p=61}}

The Coolidges had two sons: [[John Coolidge|John]] (September 7, 1906 – May 31, 2000) and Calvin Jr. (April 13, 1908 – July 7, 1924). The death of Calvin Jr. at age 16 from blood poisoning brought on by an infected blister "hurt [Coolidge] terribly," according to son John. John became a railroad executive, helped to start the Coolidge Foundation, and was instrumental in creating the [[President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site]].{{sfn|Martin|2000|p=}}

Coolidge was frugal, and when it came to securing a home, he insisted upon renting. Grace Coolidge was a member of Northampton's Edwards [[Congregational church|Congregational]] Church, but Coolidge never formally joined the congregation.{{sfn|Shlaes|2013|p=91}}

==Local political office==

===City offices===
The [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was dominant in New England at the time, and Coolidge followed the example of Hammond and Field by becoming active in local politics.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=49–51}} In 1896, Coolidge campaigned for Republican presidential candidate [[William McKinley]], and the next year he was selected to be a member of the Republican City Committee.{{sfn|White|1938|pp=51–53}} In 1898, he won election to the [[City Council]] of Northampton, placing second in a ward where the top three candidates were elected.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=49–51}} The position offered no salary but provided Coolidge invaluable political experience.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=83}} In 1899, he declined renomination, running instead for [[Solicitor#United States|City Solicitor]], a position elected by the City Council. He was elected for a one-year term in 1900, and reelected in 1901.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=84–85}} This position gave Coolidge more experience as a lawyer and paid a salary of $600 ({{Inflation|US|600|1901|fmt=eq}}).{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=84–85}} In 1902, the city council selected a Democrat for city solicitor, and Coolidge returned to private practice.{{sfn|McCoy|1967|p=29}} Soon thereafter, however, the [[Court clerk|clerk of courts]] for the county died, and Coolidge was chosen to replace him. The position paid well, but it barred him from practicing law, so he remained at the job for only one year.{{sfn|McCoy|1967|p=29}} In 1904, Coolidge suffered his sole defeat at the ballot box, losing an election to the Northampton [[Board of Education|school board]]. When told that some of his neighbors voted against him because he had no children in the schools he would govern, Coolidge replied, "Might give me time!"{{sfn|McCoy|1967|p=29}}

===State legislator and mayor===
In 1906, the local Republican committee nominated Coolidge for election to the state [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. He won a close victory over the incumbent Democrat, and reported to [[Boston]] for the 1907 session of the [[Massachusetts General Court]].{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=61}} In his freshman term, Coolidge served on minor committees and, although he usually voted with the party, was known as a [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Republican]], voting in favor of such measures as [[women's suffrage]] and the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|direct election of Senators]].{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1p=62|Fuess|1940|2p=99}} While in Boston, Coolidge became an ally, and then a liegeman, of then U.S. Senator [[Winthrop Murray Crane]] who controlled the western faction of the Massachusetts Republican Party; Crane's party rival in the east of the commonwealth was U.S. Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]].{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=63–66}} Coolidge forged another key strategic alliance with [[Guy Currier]], who had served in both state houses and had the social distinction, wealth, personal charm and broad circle of friends which Coolidge lacked, and which would have a lasting impact on his political career.{{sfn|White|1938|pp=99–102}} In 1907, he was elected to a second term, and in the 1908 session Coolidge was more outspoken, though not in a leadership position.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=68–69}}

Instead of vying for another term in the [[Massachusetts State House|State House]], Coolidge returned home to his growing family and ran for [[mayor]] of Northampton when the incumbent Democrat retired. He was well liked in the town, and defeated his challenger by a vote of 1,597 to 1,409.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=72}} During his first term (1910 to 1911), he increased teachers' salaries and retired some of the city's debt while still managing to effect a slight tax decrease.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1pp=106–07|Sobel|1998a|2p=74}} He was renominated in 1911, and defeated the same opponent by a slightly larger margin.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=108}}

In 1911, the [[Massachusetts Senate|State Senator]] for the Hampshire County area retired and successfully encouraged Coolidge to run for his seat for the 1912 session; Coolidge defeated his Democratic opponent by a large margin.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=76}} At the start of that term, he became chairman of a committee to arbitrate the "[[Bread and Roses]]" strike by the workers of the [[American Woolen Company]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]].{{efn|See also the main article, [[Lawrence textile strike]], for a full description.}} After two tense months, the company agreed to the workers' demands, in a settlement proposed by the committee.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1pp=110–11|McCoy|1967|2pp=45–46}} A major issue affecting Massachusetts Republicans that year was the [[United States presidential election, 1912|party split]] between the progressive wing, which favored [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and the conservative wing, which favored [[William Howard Taft]]. Although he favored some progressive measures, Coolidge refused to leave the Republican party.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1pp=79–80|Fuess|1940|2p=111}} When the new [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] declined to run a candidate in his state senate district, Coolidge won reelection against his Democratic opponent by an increased margin.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1pp=79–80|Fuess|1940|2p=111}}

|}

In the 1913 session, Coolidge enjoyed renowned success in arduously navigating to passage the Western Trolley Act, which connected Northampton with a dozen similar industrial communities in western Massachusetts.{{sfn|White|1938|p=105}} Coolidge intended to retire after his second term as was the custom, but when the [[President of the Massachusetts Senate|President of the State Senate]], [[Levi H. Greenwood]], considered running for Lieutenant Governor, Coolidge decided to run again for the Senate in the hopes of being elected as its presiding officer.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=114–15}} Although Greenwood later decided to run for reelection to the Senate, he was defeated primarily due to his opposition to women's suffrage; Coolidge was in favor of the women's vote, won his own re-election and with Crane's help, assumed the presidency of a closely divided Senate.{{sfn|White|1938|p=111}} After his election in January 1914, Coolidge delivered a published and frequently quoted speech entitled ''Have Faith in Massachusetts'', which summarized his philosophy of government.{{sfn|Coolidge|1919|pp=2–9}}

Coolidge's speech was well received, and he attracted some admirers on its account;{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=90–92}} towards the end of the term, many of them were proposing his name for nomination to lieutenant governor. After winning reelection to the Senate by an increased margin in the 1914 elections, Coolidge was reelected unanimously to be President of the Senate.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1p=90|Fuess|1940|2p=124}} Coolidge's supporters, led by fellow Amherst alumnus [[Frank Stearns]], encouraged him again to run for lieutenant governor.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1pp=92–98|Fuess|1940|2pp=133–36}} Stearns, an executive with the Boston department store R. H. Stearns, became another key ally, and began a publicity campaign on Coolidge's behalf before he announced his candidacy at the end of the 1915 legislative session.{{sfn|White|1938|p=117}}

==Lieutenant Governor and Governor of Massachusetts==
[[File:CoolidgeLtGov.png|thumb|upright|Calvin and Grace Coolidge, about 1918]]
Coolidge entered the [[primary election]] for lieutenant governor and was nominated to run alongside gubernatorial candidate [[Samuel W. McCall]]. Coolidge was the leading vote-getter in the Republican primary, and [[ticket balance|balanced]] the Republican ticket by adding a western presence to McCall's eastern base of support.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=139–42}} McCall and Coolidge won the 1915 election to their respective one-year terms, with Coolidge defeating his opponent by more than 50,000 votes.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=145}}

In Massachusetts, the lieutenant governor does not preside over the state Senate, as is the case in many other states; nevertheless, as lieutenant governor, Coolidge was a deputy governor functioning as administrative inspector and was a member of the governor's council. He was also chairman of the finance committee and the pardons committee.{{sfn|White|1938|p=125}} As a full-time elected official, Coolidge discontinued his law practice in 1916, though his family continued to live in Northampton.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=151–52}} McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917. When McCall decided that he would not stand for a fourth term, Coolidge announced his intention to run for governor.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=107–10}}

===1918 election===
Coolidge was unopposed for the Republican nomination for [[List of Governors of Massachusetts|Governor]] of Massachusetts in 1918. He and his running mate, [[Channing Cox]], a Boston lawyer and Speaker of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]], ran on the previous administration's record: [[fiscal conservatism]], a vague opposition to [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], support for women's suffrage, and support for American involvement in [[World War I]].{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1p=111|McCoy|1967|2pp=75–76}} The issue of the war proved divisive, especially among [[Irish American|Irish]] and [[German Americans]].{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=112}} Coolidge was elected by a margin of 16,773 votes over his opponent, Richard H. Long, in the smallest margin of victory of any of his statewide campaigns.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1p=115|McCoy|1967|2p=76}}

===Boston Police Strike===
{{Main|Boston Police Strike}}
In 1919, in reaction to a plan of the policemen of the [[Boston Police Department]] to register with a [[trade union|union]], Police Commissioner [[Edwin U. Curtis]] announced that such an act would not be tolerated. In August of that year, the [[American Federation of Labor]] issued a charter to the Boston Police Union.{{sfnm|Russell|1975|1pp=77–79|Sobel|1998a|2p=129}} Curtis declared the union's leaders were guilty of insubordination and would be relieved of duty, but indicated he would cancel their suspension if the union was dissolved by September 4.{{sfn|Russell|1975|pp=86–87}} The mayor of Boston, [[Andrew James Peters|Andrew Peters]], convinced Curtis to delay his action for a few days, but with no results, and Curtis suspended the union leaders on September 8.{{sfnm|Russell|1975|1pp=111–13|Sobel|1998a|2pp=133–36}} The following day, about three-quarters of the policemen in Boston went on strike.{{sfn|Russell|1975|p=113}}{{efn|The exact total was 1,117 out of 1,544{{sfn|Russell|1975|p=113}}}} Coolidge, tacitly but fully in support of Curtis' position, closely monitored the situation but initially deferred to the local authorities. He anticipated that only a resulting measure of lawlessness could sufficiently prompt the public to understand and appreciate the controlling principle – that a policeman does not strike. That night and the next, there was sporadic violence and rioting in the unruly city.{{sfn|White|1938|pp=162–64}} Peters, concerned about [[sympathy strike]]s by the firemen and others, called up some units of the [[Massachusetts National Guard]] stationed in the Boston area pursuant to an old and obscure legal authority, and relieved Curtis of duty.{{sfn|Russell|1975|p=120}}

| style="text-align: left;" |"Your assertion that the Commissioner was wrong cannot justify the wrong of leaving the city unguarded. That furnished the opportunity; the criminal element furnished the action. There is no right to strike against the public safety by anyone, anywhere, any time. ...

Coolidge, sensing the severity of circumstances were then in need of his intervention, conferred with Crane's operative, William Butler, and then acted.{{sfn|White|1938|pp=164–65}} He called up more units of the National Guard, restored Curtis to office, and took personal control of the police force.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=142}} Curtis proclaimed that all of the strikers were fired from their jobs, and Coolidge called for a new police force to be recruited.{{sfn|Russell|1975|pp=182–83}}
That night Coolidge received a telegram from AFL leader [[Samuel Gompers]]. "Whatever disorder has occurred", Gompers wrote, "is due to Curtis's order in which the right of the policemen has been denied…"{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=143}} Coolidge publicly answered Gompers's telegram, denying any justification whatsoever for the strike – and his response launched him into the national consciousness.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=143}} Newspapers across the nation picked up on Coolidge's statement and he became the newest hero to opponents of the strike. In the midst of the [[First Red Scare]], many Americans were terrified of the spread of [[communist]] revolution, like those that had taken place in [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russia]], [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]], and [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Germany]]. While Coolidge had lost some friends among organized labor, conservatives across the nation had seen a rising star.{{sfn|Shlaes|2013|pp=174–79}} Although he usually acted with deliberation, the Boston police strike gave him a national reputation as a decisive leader, and as a strict enforcer of law and order.

===1919 election===
[[File:Coolidge inspects militia.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Coolidge inspects militia in Boston police strike]]
Coolidge and Cox were renominated for their respective offices in 1919. By this time Coolidge's supporters (especially Stearns) had publicized his actions in the Police Strike around the state and the nation and some of Coolidge's speeches were published in book form.{{sfn|Coolidge|1919|pp=2–9}} He faced the same opponent as in 1918, Richard Long, but this time Coolidge defeated him by 125,101 votes, more than seven times his margin of victory from a year earlier.{{efn|The tally was Coolidge 317,774, Long 192,673.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=238}}}} His actions in the police strike, combined with the massive electoral victory, led to suggestions that Coolidge run for president in 1920.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1pp=239–43|McCoy|1967|2pp=102–13}}

===Legislation and vetoes as governor===
By the time Coolidge was inaugurated on January 2, 1919, the First World War had ended, and Coolidge pushed the legislature to give a $100 bonus ({{Inflation|US|100|1919|fmt=eq}}) to Massachusetts veterans. He also signed a bill reducing the work week for women and [[child labor|children]] from fifty-four hours to forty-eight, saying, "We must humanize the industry, or the system will break down."{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1p=117|Fuess|1940|2p=195}} He signed into law a budget that kept the tax rates the same, while trimming $4 million from expenditures, thus allowing the state to retire some of its debt.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=186}}

Coolidge also wielded the [[veto]] pen as governor. His most publicized veto prevented an increase in legislators' pay by 50%.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1p=187|McCoy|1967|2p=81}} Although Coolidge was personally opposed to Prohibition, he vetoed a bill in May 1920 that would have allowed the sale of beer or wine of [[Low-alcohol beer#Small beer|2.75% alcohol or less]], in Massachusetts in violation of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. "Opinions and instructions do not outmatch the Constitution," he said in his veto message. "Against it, they are void."{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=187–88}}

==Vice presidency==

===1920 election===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1920}}
At the [[1920 Republican National Convention]], most of the delegates were selected by state party conventions, not primaries. As such, the field was divided among many local favorites.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=152–53}} Coolidge was one such candidate, and while he placed as high as sixth in the voting, the powerful party bosses running the convention, primarily the party's U.S. Senators, never considered him seriously.{{sfn|White|1938|pp=198–99}} After ten ballots, the bosses and then the delegates settled on Senator [[Warren G. Harding]] of [[Ohio]] as their nominee for president.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=259–60}} When the time came to select a vice presidential nominee, the bosses also made and announced their decision on whom they wanted – Sen. [[Irvine Lenroot]] of Wisconsin – and then prematurely departed after his name was put forth, relying on the rank and file to confirm their decision. A delegate from [[Oregon]], [[Wallace McCamant]], having read ''Have Faith in Massachusetts'', proposed Coolidge for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] instead. The suggestion caught on quickly with the masses starving for an act of independence from the absent bosses, and Coolidge was unexpectedly nominated.{{sfn|White|1938|pp=211–13}}

The Democrats nominated another Ohioan, [[James M. Cox]], for president and the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], for vice president. The question of the United States joining the [[League of Nations]] was a major issue in the campaign, as was the unfinished legacy of [[Progressivism]].{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=204–12}} Harding ran a "front-porch" campaign from his home in [[Marion, Ohio]], but Coolidge took to the campaign trail in the [[Upper South]], New York, and New England – his audiences carefully limited to those familiar with Coolidge and those placing a premium upon concise and short speeches.{{sfn|White|1938|pp=217–219}} On November 2, 1920, Harding and Coolidge were victorious in a landslide, winning more than 60 percent of the popular vote, including every state outside the South.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=204–12}} They also won in [[Tennessee]], the first time a Republican ticket had won a Southern state since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=204–12}}

==="Silent Cal"===
[[File:HardingCoolidge.jpg|thumb|President Harding and Vice President Coolidge and their wives]]
The U.S. vice presidency did not carry many official duties, but Coolidge was invited by President Harding to attend cabinet meetings, making him the first vice president to do so.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=210–11}} He gave a number of unremarkable speeches around the country.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1p=219|McCoy|1967|2p=136}}

As the U.S. vice president, Coolidge and his vivacious wife [[Grace Coolidge|Grace]] were invited to quite a few parties, where the legend of "Silent Cal" was born. It is from this time that most of the jokes and anecdotes involving Coolidge originate. Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private he was a man of few words and was commonly referred to as "Silent Cal". A possibly apocryphal story has it that a matron, seated next to him at a dinner, said to him, "I made a bet today that I could get more than two words out of you." He replied, "You lose."{{sfn|Hannaford|p=169}} [[Dorothy Parker]], upon learning that Coolidge had died, reportedly remarked, "How can they tell?"{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|p=9}} Coolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society; when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties, he replied, "Got to eat somewhere."{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=217}} [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth]], a leading Republican wit, underscored Coolidge's silence and his dour personality: "When he wished he were elsewhere, he pursed his lips, folded his arms, and said nothing. He looked then precisely as though he had been weaned on a pickle."{{sfn|Cordery|2008|p=302}}

As president, Coolidge's reputation as a quiet man continued. "The words of a President have an enormous weight," he would later write, "and ought not to be used indiscriminately."{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=243}} Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation; indeed, he cultivated it. "I think the American people want a solemn ass as a President," he once told [[Ethel Barrymore]], "and I think I will go along with them."{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|p=60}} Some historians would later suggest that Coolidge's image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic,{{sfn|Buckley|pp=593–626}} while others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural, deepening after the death of his son in 1924.{{sfn|Gilbert|pp=87–109}}

==Presidency==
{{Main|Presidency of Calvin Coolidge}}
On August 2, 1923, President Harding died unexpectedly in San Francisco while on a speaking tour of the western United States. Vice President Coolidge was in Vermont visiting his [[Coolidge Homestead|family home]], which had neither electricity nor a telephone, when he received word by messenger of Harding's death.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=308–09}} The new president dressed, said a prayer, and came downstairs to greet the reporters who had assembled.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=308–09}} His father, a [[notary public]] and [[Justice of the peace#Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont|justice of the peace]], administered the [[Oath of office#United States|oath of office]] in the family's parlor by the light of a [[kerosene lamp]] at 2:47&amp;nbsp;a.m. on August 3, 1923; President Coolidge then went back to bed.

Coolidge returned to Washington the next day, and was sworn in again by Justice [[Adolph A. Hoehling Jr.]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|Supreme Court of the District of Columbia]], to forestall any questions about the authority of a state official to administer a federal oath.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=310–15}} This second oath-taking remained a secret until it was revealed by [[Harry M. Daugherty]] in 1932, and confirmed by Hoehling.{{sfn|"Confirms Daugherty's Story of Coolidge's Second Oath"}} When Hoehling confirmed Daugherty's story, he indicated that Daugherty, then serving as [[United States Attorney General]], asked him to administer the oath without fanfare at the [[Willard InterContinental Washington|Willard Hotel]].{{sfn|"Confirms Daugherty's Story of Coolidge's Second Oath"}}  According to Hoehling, he did not question Daugherty's reason for requesting a second oath-taking but assumed it was to resolve any doubt about whether the first swearing-in was valid.{{sfn|"Confirms Daugherty's Story of Coolidge's Second Oath"}}

The nation initially did not know what to make of Coolidge, who had maintained a low profile in the Harding administration; many had even expected him to be replaced on the ballot in 1924.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1pp=226–28|Fuess|1940|2pp=303–05|Ferrell|1998|3pp=43–51}} Coolidge believed that those of Harding's men under suspicion were entitled to every presumption of innocence, taking a methodical approach to the scandals, principally the [[Teapot Dome scandal]], while others clamored for rapid punishment of those they presumed guilty.{{sfn|White|1938|p=265}} Coolidge thought the Senate investigations of the scandals would suffice; this was affirmed by the resulting resignations of those involved. He personally intervened in demanding the resignation of Attorney General [[Harry M. Daugherty]] after he refused to cooperate with the congressional probe. He then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in the administration, arranging for a full briefing on the wrongdoing. [[Harry A. Slattery]] reviewed the facts with him, [[Harlan F. Stone]] analyzed the legal aspects for him and Senator [[William E. Borah]] assessed and presented the political factors.{{sfn|White|1938|pp=272–77}}

Coolidge addressed Congress when it reconvened on December 6, 1923, giving a speech that supported many of Harding's policies, including Harding's formal budgeting process, the enforcement of [[Immigration Act of 1924|immigration restrictions]] and arbitration of coal strikes ongoing in [[Pennsylvania]].{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1pp=328–29|Sobel|1998a|2pp=248–49}} Coolidge's speech was the first presidential speech to be broadcast over the radio.{{sfn|Shlaes|2013|p=271}} The [[Washington Naval Treaty]] was proclaimed just one month into Coolidge's term, and was generally well received in the country.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=320–22}} In May 1924, the World War I veterans' [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act]] or "Bonus Bill" was passed over his veto.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=341}} Coolidge signed the [[Immigration Act of 1924|Immigration Act]] later that year, which was aimed at restricting southern and eastern European immigration, but appended a [[signing statement]] expressing his unhappiness with the bill's specific exclusion of [[Japanese American|Japanese]] immigrants.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1p=342|Sobel|1998a|2p=269}} Just before the Republican Convention began, Coolidge signed into law the [[Revenue Act of 1924]], which reduced the top marginal tax rate from 58% to 46%, as well as personal [[income tax]] rates across the board, increased the [[estate tax]] and bolstered it with a new [[gift tax]].{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=278–79}}

On June 2, 1924, Coolidge signed the act granting citizenship to all Native Americans born in the United States. By that time, two-thirds of the people were already citizens, having gained it through marriage, military service (veterans of World War I were granted citizenship in 1919), or the land allotments that had earlier taken place.{{sfn| Madsen | 2015 |p= 168}}{{sfn| Kappler | 1929 |p=}}{{sfn| Landry | 2016 |p=}}

===1924 election===

The [[1924 Republican National Convention|Republican Convention]] was held on June 10–12, 1924, in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]; Coolidge was nominated on the first ballot.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=345–46}} The convention nominated [[Frank Orren Lowden|Frank Lowden]] of [[Illinois]] for vice president on the second ballot, but he declined; former Brigadier General [[Charles G.

The Democrats held their [[1924 Democratic National Convention|convention]] the next month in [[New York City]]. The convention soon deadlocked, and after 103 ballots, the delegates finally agreed on a compromise candidate, [[John W. Davis]], with [[Charles W. Bryan]] nominated for vice president. The Democrats' hopes were buoyed when [[Robert M. La Follette Sr.]], a Republican senator from [[Wisconsin]], split from the GOP to form a new [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party]]. Many believed that the split in the Republican party, like the one in 1912, would allow a Democrat to win the presidency.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=300}}

After the conventions and the death of his younger son Calvin, Coolidge became withdrawn; he later said that "when he [the son] died, the power and glory of the Presidency went with him."{{sfn|Coolidge|1929|p=190}} Even as he mourned, Coolidge ran his standard campaign, not mentioning his opponents by name or maligning them, and delivering speeches on his theory of government, including several that were broadcast over radio.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=300–01}} It was the most subdued campaign since 1896, partly because of Coolidge's grief, but also because of his naturally non-confrontational style.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=302–03}} The other candidates campaigned in a more modern fashion, but despite the split in the Republican party, the results were similar to those of 1920. Coolidge and Dawes won every state outside the South except Wisconsin, La Follette's home state. Coolidge won the election with 382 electoral votes and the popular vote by 2.5&amp;nbsp;million over his opponents' combined total.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=354}}

During Coolidge's presidency, the United States experienced a period of rapid economic growth known as the "[[Roaring Twenties]]." He left the administration's industrial policy in the hands of his activist Secretary of Commerce, [[Herbert Hoover]], who energetically used government auspices to promote business efficiency and develop airlines and radio.{{sfn|Ferrell|1998|pp=64–65}} Coolidge disdained regulation, and demonstrated this by appointing commissioners to the [[Federal Trade Commission]] and the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] who did little to restrict the activities of businesses under their jurisdiction.{{sfnm|Ferrell|1998|1pp=66–72|Sobel|1998a|2p=318}} The regulatory state under Coolidge was, as one biographer described it, "thin to the point of invisibility."{{sfn|Ferrell|1998|p=72}}

Historian [[Robert Sobel]] offers some context of Coolidge's [[laissez-faire]] ideology, based on the prevailing understanding of [[federalism]] during his presidency: "As Governor of Massachusetts, Coolidge supported wages and hours legislation, opposed [[child labor]], imposed economic controls during [[World War I]], favored safety measures in factories, and even worker representation on corporate boards. Did he support these measures while president? No, because in the 1920s, such matters were considered the responsibilities of state and local governments."{{sfnm|Sobel|1998b|p=}}{{sfnm|Greenberg|2006|1p=47|Ferrell|1998|2p=62}}

===Taxation and government spending===
Coolidge adopted the taxation policies of his Secretary of the Treasury, [[Andrew Mellon]], who advocated "scientific taxation" — the notion that lowering taxes will increase, rather than decrease, government receipts.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1pp=310–11|Greenberg|2006|2pp=127–29}} Congress agreed, and tax rates were reduced in Coolidge's term.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1pp=310–11|Greenberg|2006|2pp=127–29}} In addition to federal tax cuts, Coolidge proposed reductions in federal expenditures and retiring of the [[United States public debt|federal debt]].{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1pp=310–11|Fuess|1940|2pp=382–83}} Coolidge's ideas were shared by the Republicans in Congress, and in 1924, Congress passed the [[Revenue Act of 1924]], which reduced income tax rates and eliminated all income taxation for some two million people.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1pp=310–11|Fuess|1940|2pp=382–83}} They reduced taxes again by passing the Revenue Acts of [[Revenue Act of 1926|1926]] and [[Revenue Act of 1928|1928]], all the while continuing to keep spending down so as to reduce the overall federal debt.{{sfn|Ferrell|1998|p=170}} By 1927, only the wealthiest 2% of taxpayers paid any federal income tax.{{sfn|Ferrell|1998|p=170}} Federal spending remained flat during Coolidge's administration, allowing one-fourth of the federal debt to be retired in total. State and local governments saw considerable growth, however, surpassing the federal budget in 1927.{{sfn|Ferrell|1998|p=174}}

===Opposition to farm subsidies===
[[File:Coolidge-Dawes.jpg|thumb|upright|Coolidge with his vice president, [[Charles G. Dawes]]]]
Perhaps the most contentious issue of Coolidge's presidency was relief for farmers. Some in Congress proposed a bill designed to fight falling agricultural prices by allowing the federal government to purchase crops to sell abroad at lower prices.{{sfnm|Ferrell|1998|1p=84|McCoy|1967|2pp=234–35}} Agriculture Secretary [[Henry Cantwell Wallace|Henry C. Wallace]] and other administration officials favored the bill when it was introduced in 1924, but rising prices convinced many in Congress that the bill was unnecessary, and it was defeated just before the elections that year.{{sfn|McCoy|1967|p=235}} In 1926, with farm prices falling once more, Senator [[Charles L. McNary]] and Representative [[Gilbert N. Haugen]]—both Republicans—proposed the [[McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill]]. The bill proposed a federal farm board that would purchase surplus production in high-yield years and hold it (when feasible) for later sale or sell it abroad.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=383–84}} Coolidge opposed McNary-Haugen, declaring that agriculture must stand "on an independent business basis," and said that "government control cannot be divorced from political control."{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=383–84}} Instead of manipulating prices, he favored instead [[Herbert Hoover]]'s proposal to increase profitability by modernizing agriculture. Secretary Mellon wrote a letter denouncing the McNary-Haugen measure as unsound and likely to cause inflation, and it was defeated.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=327}}

After McNary-Haugen's defeat, Coolidge supported a less radical measure, the Curtis-Crisp Act, which would have created a federal board to lend money to farm co-operatives in times of surplus; the bill did not pass.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=327}} In February 1927, Congress took up the McNary-Haugen bill again, this time narrowly passing it, and Coolidge vetoed it.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1p=388|Ferrell|1998|2p=93}} In his veto message, he expressed the belief that the bill would do nothing to help farmers, benefiting only exporters and expanding the federal bureaucracy.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=331}} Congress did not override the veto, but it passed the bill again in May 1928 by an increased majority; again, Coolidge vetoed it.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1p=388|Ferrell|1998|2p=93}} "Farmers never have made much money," said Coolidge, the Vermont farmer's son. "I do not believe we can do much about it."{{sfn|Ferrell|1998|p=86}}

===Flood control===
Coolidge has often been criticized for his actions during the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], the worst natural disaster to hit the Gulf Coast until [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1p=315|Barry|1997|2pp=286–87|Greenberg|2006|3pp=132–35}} Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed a lack of interest in federal flood control.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1p=315|Barry|1997|2pp=286–87|Greenberg|2006|3pp=132–35}} Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, and that it would be seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost.{{sfn|McCoy|1967|pp=330–31}} On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation.{{sfn|Barry|1997|pp=372–74}} When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|p=135}}

===Civil rights===
[[File:1924 Indian Citizenship Act.jpg|thumb|right|[[Osage Nation|Osage]] men with Coolidge after he signed the bill granting Native Americans U.S. citizenship.]]

According to one biographer, Coolidge was "devoid of racial prejudice," but rarely took the lead on civil rights.  Coolidge disliked the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and no Klansman is known to have received an appointment from him. In the 1924 presidential election his opponents (Robert La Follette and John Davis), and his running mate Charles Dawes, often attacked the Klan but Coolidge avoided the subject.{{sfn|Roberts|2014|p=209}}

Coolidge spoke in favor of the civil rights of [[African-American]]s, saying in his first [[State of the Union address]] that their rights were "just as sacred as those of any other citizen" under the U.S. Constitution and that it was a "public and a private duty to protect those rights."{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1p=250|McCoy|1967|2pp=328–29}}&lt;ref name="1923SOTU"&gt;[[s:Calvin Coolidge's First State of the Union Address]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coolidge repeatedly called for laws to make  [[Lynching in the United States|lynching a federal crime]] (it was already a state crime, though not always enforced). Congress refused to pass any such legislation. On June 2, 1924, Coolidge signed the [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924|Indian Citizenship Act]], which granted U.S. citizenship to all American Indians living on reservations (those off reservations had long been citizens).{{sfn|Deloria|1992|p=91}} On June 6, 1924, Coolidge delivered a commencement address at historically black, non-segregated [[Howard University]], in which he thanked and commended African-Americans for their rapid advances in education and their contributions to U.S. society over the years, as well as their eagerness to render their services as soldiers in the World War, all while being faced with discrimination and prejudices at home.{{sfn|Coolidge|1926|pp=31–36}}

In a speech in October 1924, Coolidge stressed tolerance of differences as an American value and thanked immigrants for their contributions to U.S. society, saying that they have "contributed much to making our country what it is." He stated that although the diversity of peoples was a detrimental source of conflict and tension in Europe, it was peculiar for the United States that it was a "harmonious" benefit for the country. Coolidge further stated the United States should assist and help immigrants who come to the country, and urged immigrants to reject "race hatreds" and "prejudices".{{sfn|Coolidge|1926|pp=159–56}}

===Foreign policy===
[[File:Ccoolidge.jpeg|thumb|Official portrait of Calvin Coolidge]]
Coolidge was neither well versed in nor very interested in world affairs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://millercenter.org/president/coolidge/foreign-affairs|title=Calvin Coolidge: Foreign Affairs {{!}} Miller Center|date=2016-10-04|work=Miller Center|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; His focus was directed mainly at American business, especially pertaining to trade, and "Maintaining the Status Quo." Although not an isolationist, he was reluctant to enter into foreign alliances.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=342}}

Coolidge considered the 1920 Republican victory as a rejection of the [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilsonian]] position that the United States should join the [[League of Nations]].{{sfn|McCoy|1967|pp=184–85}} While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did not advocate U.S. membership.{{sfn|McCoy|1967|pp=184–85}} He spoke in favor of the United States joining the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions.{{sfn|McCoy|1967|p=360}} In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with [[reservation (law)|reservations]]).{{sfn|McCoy|1967|p=363}} The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own.{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|pp=114–16}} The Senate failed to act and so the United States did not join the World Court.{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|pp=114–16}}

Coolidge authorized the [[Dawes Plan]], a financial plan by [[Charles Dawes]], to provide Germany partial relief from [[World War I reparations|its reparations obligations]] from [[World War I]]. The plan was initially provided stimulus for the German economy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Dawes-Plan|title=Dawes Plan {{!}} World War I reparations|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Coolidge attempted to pursue further curbs on naval strength following the early successes of Harding's [[Washington Naval Conference]] by sponsoring the [[Geneva Naval Conference]] in 1927, which failed owing to a French and Italian boycott and ultimate failure of Great Britain and the United States to agree on cruiser tonnages. As a result, the conference was a failure and Congress eventually authorized for increased American naval spending in 1928.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Kellogg–Briand Pact]] of 1928, named for Coolidge's Secretary of State, [[Frank B. Kellogg]], and French foreign minister [[Aristide Briand]], was also a key peacekeeping initiative. The treaty, ratified in 1929, committed signatories—the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan—to "renounce war, as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another."{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=421–23}} The treaty did not achieve its intended result—the outlawry of war—but it did provide the founding principle for international law after [[World War II]].{{sfnm|McCoy|1967|1pp=380–81|Greenberg|2006|2pp=123–24}} Coolidge also continued the previous administration's policy of withholding recognition of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|McCoy|1967|p=181}}

Efforts were made to [[Mexico–United States relations|normalize ties]] with post-[[Mexican Revolution|Revolution]] Mexico. Coolidge recognized Mexico's new governments under [[Álvaro Obregón]] and [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], and continued American support for the elected Mexican government against the [[National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty]] during the [[Cristero War]], lifting the arms embargo on that country; he also appointed [[Dwight Morrow]] as [[United States Ambassador to Mexico|Ambassador to Mexico]] with the successful objective to avoid further American conflict with Mexico.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidentprofiles.com/Grant-Eisenhower/Calvin-Coolidge-Foreign-policy.html|title=Foreign policy - Calvin Coolidge - war, domestic|website=www.presidentprofiles.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=349}}{{sfn|McCoy|1967|pp=178–79}}

Coolidge's administration would see continuity in the [[United States occupation of Nicaragua|occupation of Nicaragua]] and [[United States occupation of Haiti|Haiti]], and an end to the [[1916 United States occupation of the Dominican Republic|occupation of the Dominican Republic]] in 1924 as a result of withdrawal agreements finalized during Harding's administration.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1pp=414–17|Ferrell|1998|2pp=122–23}} In 1925, Coolidge ordered the withdrawal of [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] stationed in Nicaragua following perceived stability after the [[Nicaraguan general election, 1924|1924 Nicaraguan general election]], but redeployed them there in January 1927 following failed attempts to peacefully resolve the rapid deterioration of political stability and the ensuing [[Nicaraguan civil war (1926–27)|Constitutionalist War]]; [[Henry L. Stimson]] was later sent by Coolidge to mediate [[Pact of Espino Negro|a peace deal]] that would end the civil war and extend American military presence in Nicaragua beyond Coolidge's term in office.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

To extend an [[olive branch]] to Latin American leaders embittered over America's [[Banana Wars|interventionist policies]] in [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]],{{sfn|Miller Center|2016|p=}} Coolidge led the U.S. delegation to the [[Pan-American Conference|Sixth International Conference of American States]], January 15–17, 1928, in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], the only international trip Coolidge made during his presidency.{{sfn|Historian|2018|p=}} He would be the last sitting American president to visit Cuba until [[Barack Obama]] in 2016.{{sfn|Kim|2014|p=}}

For Canada, Coolidge authorized the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]], a system of locks and canals that would provide large vessels passage between the Atlantic Ocean and the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seaway.dot.gov/about/great-lakes-st-lawrence-seaway-system|title=The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway System|date=2014-03-20|work=Saint Lawrence Seaway|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://coolidgefoundation.org/presidency/foreign-policy/|title=Foreign Policy|website=coolidgefoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1928 election===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1928}}
[[File:Calvin Coolidge video montage.ogg|thumb|Collection of video clips of President Coolidge]]
In the summer of 1927, Coolidge vacationed in the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]], where he engaged in horseback riding and fly fishing and attended [[rodeo]]s. He made [[Custer State Park]] his "summer White House." While on vacation, Coolidge surprisingly issued a terse statement that he would not seek a second full term as president: "[[I do not choose to run|I do not choose to run for President in 1928]]."{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=370}} After allowing the reporters to take that in, Coolidge elaborated. "If I take another term, I will be in the White House till 1933&amp;nbsp;… Ten years in Washington is longer than any other man has had it—too long!"{{sfn|White|1938|p=361}} In his memoirs, Coolidge explained his decision not to run: "The Presidential office takes a heavy toll of those who occupy it and those who are dear to them. While we should not refuse to spend and be spent in the service of our country, it is hazardous to attempt what we feel is beyond our strength to accomplish."{{sfn|Coolidge|1929|p=239}} After leaving office, he and Grace returned to Northampton, where he wrote his memoirs. The Republicans retained the White House in 1928 with a landslide by  [[Herbert Hoover]]. Coolidge had been reluctant to endorse Hoover as his successor; on one occasion he remarked that "for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice—all of it bad."{{sfn|Ferrell|1998|p=195}} Even so, Coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the nomination of the popular commerce secretary.{{sfn|Clemens| Daggett|1945|p=147-63}}

===Cabinet===
[[File:Coolidge Cabinet.jpg|thumb|Coolidge's cabinet in 1924, outside the [[White House]]&lt;br /&gt;Front row, left to right: [[Harry Stewart New]], [[John W. Weeks]], [[Charles Evans Hughes]], Coolidge, [[Andrew Mellon]], [[Harlan F. Stone]], [[Curtis D. Wilbur]]&lt;br /&gt;Back row, left to right, [[James J. Davis]], [[Henry Cantwell Wallace|Henry C. Wallace]], [[Herbert Hoover]], [[Hubert Work]]]]
Although a few of Harding's cabinet appointees were scandal-tarred, Coolidge initially retained all of them, out of an ardent conviction that as successor to a deceased elected president he was obligated to retain Harding's counselors and policies until the next election. He kept Harding's able speechwriter [[Judson T. Welliver]]; Stuart Crawford replaced Welliver in November 1925.{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|pp=48–49}} Coolidge appointed [[C. Bascom Slemp]], a [[Virginia]] Congressman and experienced federal politician, to work jointly with Edward T. Clark, a Massachusetts Republican organizer whom he retained from his vice-presidential staff, as [[Secretary to the President (United States)|Secretaries to the President]] (a position equivalent to the modern [[White House Chief of Staff]]).{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=320–22}}

Perhaps the most powerful person in Coolidge's Cabinet was Secretary of the Treasury [[Andrew Mellon]], who controlled the administration's financial policies and was regarded by many, including House Minority Leader [[John Nance Garner]], as more powerful than Coolidge himself.{{sfn|Rusnak|1983|pp=270–71}} Secretary of Commerce [[Herbert Hoover]] also held a prominent place in Coolidge's Cabinet, in part because Coolidge found value in Hoover's ability to win positive publicity with his pro-business proposals.{{sfn|Polsky|Tkacheva|2002|pp=224–27}} Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]] directed Coolidge's foreign policy until he resigned in 1925 following Coolidge's re-election. He was replaced by [[Frank B. Kellogg]], who had previously served as a Senator and as the ambassador to Great Britain. Coolidge made two other appointments following his re-election, with [[William M. Jardine]] taking the position of Secretary of Agriculture and [[John G. Sargent]] becoming Attorney General.{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|pp=111–12}} Coolidge did not have a vice president during his first term, but [[Charles Dawes]] became vice president during Coolidge's second term, and Dawes and Coolidge clashed over farm policy and other issues.{{sfn|Senate Historian|2014|p=}}

===Judicial appointments===
{{Main|List of federal judges appointed by Calvin Coolidge}}
[[File:Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone photograph circa 1927-1932.jpg|thumb|upright|Coolidge appointed [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] Attorney General and then Supreme Court Justice]]

Coolidge appointed one justice to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] in 1925. Stone was Coolidge's fellow Amherst alumnus, a Wall Street lawyer and conservative Republican. Stone was serving as dean of [[Columbia Law School]] when Coolidge appointed him to be attorney general in 1924 to restore the reputation tarnished by Harding's Attorney General, [[Harry M. Daugherty]].{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=364}} It does not appear that Coolidge considered appointing anyone other than Stone, although Stone himself had urged Coolidge to appoint [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]].{{sfn| Handler |1995|pp=113–122}} Stone proved to be a firm believer in [[judicial restraint]] and was regarded as one of the court's [[The Three Musketeers (Supreme Court)|three liberal justices]] who would often vote to uphold New Deal legislation.{{sfn|Galston|loc=''passim''}} President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] later appointed Stone to be chief justice.

Coolidge nominated 17 judges to the [[United States Courts of Appeals]], and 61 judges to the [[United States district courts]]. He appointed judges to various specialty courts as well, including [[Genevieve R. Cline]], who became the first woman named to the federal judiciary when Coolidge placed her on the [[United States Customs Court]] in 1928.{{sfn|Freeman|2002|p=216}} Coolidge also signed the [[Judiciary Act of 1925]] into law, allowing the Supreme Court more discretion over its workload.

==Retirement and death==
[[File:Coolidge public address.jpg|thumb|right|Coolidge addressing a crowd at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]'s Roman style [[Arlington Memorial Amphitheater|Memorial Amphitheater]] in 1924.]]
After his presidency, Coolidge retired to the modest rented house on residential Massasoit Street in [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]] before moving to a more spacious home, "The Beeches."{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=407}} He kept a [[Hacker-Craft|Hacker]] runabout boat on the Connecticut River and was often observed on the water by local boating enthusiasts. During this period, he also served as chairman of the Non-Partisan Railroad Commission, an entity created by several banks and corporations to survey the country's long-term transportation needs and make recommendations for improvements.  He was the honorary president of the [[American Foundation for the Blind]], a director of [[New York Life Insurance Company]], president of the [[American Antiquarian Society]], and a trustee of Amherst College.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=450–55}}

Coolidge published [[The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge|his autobiography]] in 1929 and wrote a syndicated newspaper column, "Calvin Coolidge Says," from 1930 to 1931.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1p=403|Ferrell|1998|2pp=201–02}} Faced with looming defeat in the [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential election]], some Republicans spoke of rejecting Herbert Hoover as their party's nominee, and instead drafting Coolidge to run, but the former president made it clear that he was not interested in running again, and that he would publicly repudiate any effort to draft him, should it come about.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1pp=457–59|Greenberg|2006|2p=153}} Hoover was renominated, and Coolidge made several radio addresses in support of him. Hoover then lost the general election to Coolidge's 1920 vice presidential Democratic opponent [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in a landslide.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=460}}

{{anchor|Death}}
Coolidge died suddenly from [[coronary thrombosis]] at "The Beeches," at 12:45&amp;nbsp;p.m., January 5, 1933.{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|pp=154–55}} Shortly before his death, Coolidge confided to an old friend: "I feel I no longer fit in with these times."{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=410}} Coolidge is buried in [[Plymouth Notch Cemetery]], [[Plymouth Notch]], Vermont. The nearby family home is maintained as one of the original buildings on the [[Calvin Coolidge Homestead District]] site. The State of Vermont dedicated a new visitors' center nearby to mark Coolidge's 100th birthday on July 4, 1972.

==Radio, film, and commemorations==
[[File:Coolidge with press.jpg|upright|thumb|Coolidge, reporters, and cameramen]]
Despite his reputation as a quiet and even reclusive politician, Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while president. He made himself available to reporters, giving 520 press conferences, meeting with reporters more regularly than any president before or since.{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|p=7}} Coolidge's [[Second inauguration of Calvin Coolidge|second inauguration]] was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio. On December 6, 1923, he was the first president whose address to Congress was broadcast on radio.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=252}} Coolidge signed the [[Radio Act of 1927]], which assigned regulation of radio to the newly created [[Federal Radio Commission]]. On August 11, 1924, [[Theodore W. Case]], using the [[Phonofilm]] [[sound-on-film]] process he developed for [[Lee DeForest]], filmed Coolidge on the White House lawn, making Coolidge the first president to appear in a sound film. The title of the DeForest film was ''President Coolidge, Taken on the White House Grounds''.{{sfn|de Forest|1924|p=}} When [[Charles Lindbergh]] arrived in Washington on a U.S. Navy ship after his celebrated 1927 trans-Atlantic flight, President Coolidge welcomed him back to the U.S. and a sound-on-film record of the event exists.

The boxing card was organized at [[Caesars Palace]] in Las Vegas.&lt;ref name="HBO"/&gt; Quitana dominated the fight's tempo throughout the contest relying on his boxing skills while Julio tried to utilize his strength.&lt;ref name="HBO"/&gt; The judges awarded Quintana a unanimous decision with scores of 118-110, 117-111 and 115-112. In this match Quintana defended the WBO's Latino welterweight title and won the [[World Boxing Council]]'s Latino welterweight title. This was regarded as one of Quintana's most important fights, prompting future championship opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Quintana se metió en los chavos | author=Carlos González| publisher=Primera Hora| chapter=Deportes| language=Spanish| date=2006-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2006, Quintana fought fellow undefeated Puerto Rican Cotto, who moved up in weight from Jr. Welterweight. Quintana started the fight boxing and connecting right jabs, the round concluded with both users exchanging combinations.&lt;ref name="Cotto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingtimes.com/analyses/2006/061202cotto_quintana.html |title=Cotto Crushes Quintana In Five |author=John Gregg |publisher=The Boxing Times |date=2006-12-02 |accessdate=2008-02-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017114731/http://boxingtimes.com/analyses/2006/061202cotto_quintana.html |archivedate=2007-10-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern continued in the second round, with Cotto connecting two solid body punches to Quintana.&lt;ref name="Cotto"/&gt; Quintana began the third round connecting a solid jab to Cotto's face, but the round concluded with Cotto connecting several combinations to the body. In the fifth round Cotto had control of the fight's tempo, and connected several combinations to the body, scoring a knockdown while switching between the orthodox and southpaw stances.&lt;ref name="Cotto"/&gt; Between rounds Quintana indicated that he was unable to continue, the corner wanted to continue but Quintana was unresponsive when the referee asked if he wanted to proceed. The fight was stopped and Cotto was declared the winner, when interviewed Quintana noted that he: "underestimated his velocity. He has very quick hands, you have to give all the respect to Miguel, he's very fast and he hit me pretty good."&lt;ref name="Cotto"/&gt;

===Winning and defending the welterweight title===
Williams, the reigning [[World Boxing Organization]] welterweight champion, had been scheduled for a unification bout against [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] welterweight champion [[Kermit Cintron]] on February 2, 2008. However, Cintron injured his right hand in November 2007, and was forced to pull out of the fight. After Judah reportedly turned down an offer to take Cintron's place, an offer was instead extended to Quintana. The fight took place on February 9, 2008 and Quintana scored an impressive win over Williams, outboxing him in the bout.[http://www.badlefthook.com/story/2007/12/5/17292/0189]

On June 7, 2008, Carlos Quintana was defeated by Paul Williams in the first round at 2:15 to lose the welterweight title.

===Light middleweight division===
Quintana returned to action on October 25, 2008, this time competing in the [[light middleweight]] division. His first fight in this category was against Joshua Onyango, serving as the main event of a card titled "Final Decision" which was held in [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primerahora.com/noticia/boxeo/accion_deportiva/el_indio_en_pie_de_guerra/242678 |title="El Indio" en pie de guerra |author=José Ayala Gordián |publisher=''Primera Hora'' |language=Spanish |date=2008-10-27 |accessdate=2009-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930092059/http://www.primerahora.com/noticia/boxeo/accion_deportiva/el_indio_en_pie_de_guerra/242678 |archivedate=September 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to establish control of the fight's tempo from an early stage, eventually scoring a knockdown in the third. In the fourth round, the referee decided to stop the contest when Onyango was unable to respond to a combination, awarding Quintana a technical knockout victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/news/story?id=740519&amp;s=box&amp;type=column |title=Un repaso de lo mejor| author=Dan Rafael| publisher=[[ESPN Deportes]]| language=Spanish| date=2008-10-27| accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the outcome of this fight, he announced his decision to move up in weight in a definitive manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primerahora.com/noticia/boxeo/accion_deportiva/el_indio_se_muda_de_peso/247600 |title="El Indio" se muda de peso |author=Carlos González |publisher=''Primera Hora'' |language=Spanish |date=2008-11-12 |accessdate=2009-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201063341/http://www.primerahora.com/noticia/boxeo/accion_deportiva/el_indio_se_muda_de_peso/247600 |archivedate=December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to welterweight division===

Quintana would return to the welterweight division on April 11, 2010 to take on [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] welterweight champion, [[Andre Berto]] for the latter's [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] belt. In a rough and rugged slug-fest, Quintana was eventually overwhelmed by the speed and power of the younger Berto and would go on to lose the fight by an 8th-round TKO.

On May 5, 2012 Quintana defeated Deandre Latimore by KO in the 6th round to win the NABO [[light middleweight]] title.

In November 2012, Quintana (29-4, 23KOs) finally decided to call it a day. The Puerto Rican boxer announced his retirement after suffering a fourth-round TKO defeat to [[Keith Thurman]] (19-0, 18KOs) at the Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario, California on the 24th of that month. Throughout his career he won 29 of 33 professional contests, only coming up short against fellow world-class fighters: [[Miguel Cotto]], [[Paul Williams (boxer)|Paul Williams]], [[Andre Berto]] and Keith Thurman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8375">[[File:Frances Moore Brooke (1724-1789) by Read.jpg|thumb|Read's portrait of [[Frances Moore Brooke]], circa 1771]]
'''Katherine Read''' (or '''Catherine''') (1723—1778), was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[portrait-painter]]

==Life==
Read was born in [[Dundee]] Scotland, on 3 February 1723, to Alexander and Elizabeth Read, and one of thirteen children of an affluent [[Forfarshire]] family.&lt;ref name="Caw2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Caw|first=Sir James Lewis|title=Scottish Painting, Past and Present, 1620-1908|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WBzmBjvQPOQC&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=15 November 2010|year=2009|publisher=General Books LLC|isbn=978-1-150-59407-6|pages=49–}}&lt;/ref&gt; She may have received her education in [[Edinburgh]]. Her mother was the sister of Sir John Wedderburn, a man who’d fought in the Jacobite rising of 1745, and whose daughters were cared for by Read after his execution.&lt;ref name=Steuart&gt;Miss Katherine Read, Court Paintress, A. Francis Steuart, ''The Scottish Historical Review'', Vol. 2, No. 5 (Oct., 1904), pp. 38-46 ([https://www.jstor.org/pss/25517548 abstract])&lt;/ref&gt;

When the war ended at the [[Battle of Culloden]] and with family friends fleeing to France, Read’s family was prompted to follow suit for their association and support of the Jacobite cause through her uncle. Through their connections of the gentry, they were given sanctuary in Paris, France that same year and introduced to the painter Robert Strange -whom is speculated to be Read’s teacher and introduction into the French artistic sphere. There she studied other works of art and improved her skills with little hindrance or instruction; it would have been hard for her to have been accepted into an academy class as a woman, let alone a foreigner whose family had a price on their heads for aiding and supporting a cause against the King of England.

This period  was not to last, however, as she fled to Rome in 1750 along with a majority of the Jacobites that’d sought refuge in Paris. While there, she became friends with members of the Roman Catholic Church, often commissioned to recreate master paintings in oil or pastel for those in higher positions of the church’s hierarchy. One of these faithful patrons, [[Cardinal Albani]], allowed Read to copy some of his Carriera portraits from his personal collection, which ultimately led the man to sit for her himself.

She remained in Rome until deciding to venture to England in 1753, with the blessing of Albani -who managed to help her keep face regardless of her family’s past alignment in the war. This era was not only filled with a healthy stream of patronage and commissions, as Read was communicating and submitting samples to the Society of Arts for their collection and approval of fixing pastels. However, her methods, when compared to fellow artist Sebastien Jurine’s own, were considered inferior as she used a different type of pastel than he.

In 1764, Read was on the road back to Paris for commissioned portraits of Madame Elisabeth through the Dauphin. Her work was shown by the Free Society (1761-1768) and the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain|Society of Artists]] (1760-1772) -of which she became an honorary member in 1769 along with the two other female pastel artists [[Mary Benwell]] and Mary Black in response to the [[Royal Academy]] accepting [[Angelica Kauffman]] and [[Mary Moser]] into their respective fold. Later, after a failed petition to the king, Read left to join the Royal Academy and was expelled from the Society as consequence.

New pastel artists rose into the public’s view and Miss Read no longer commanded such a following. In 1771, she left England with her niece, Helena Beatson, to sail to India to paint the portraits of the English Officers living there. Her health deteriorated while abroad and Miss Read found herself on a boat back to England in 1778, unfortunately dying while on the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeffares|first= Neil|title=Read, Katherine|work= Neil Jeffares, Dictionary of Pastellists Before 1800 (2016): 1-17|accessdate= 23 December 2016|url=http://www.pastellists.com/Articles/Read.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Read was for some years a fashionable artist in [[London]], working in [[oil painting|oils]], [[Pastel|crayons]], and [[portrait miniature|miniature]]. From 1760 she exhibited almost annually with either the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain|Incorporated Society of Artists]], the Free Society of Artist, or the [[Royal Academy]], sending chiefly portraits of ladies and children of the aristocracy, which she painted with much grace and refinement.&lt;ref name=DNB00&gt;{{cite DNB|no-icon=1|prescript=|wstitle = Read, Catherine|first = Freeman Marius|last = O'Donoghue|authorlink = Freeman Marius O'Donoghue|volume = 47}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Read's talent for portraiture was highly regarded in her day,&lt;ref name="EdwardsWalpole1808"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Edward|last2=Walpole|first2=Horace|title=Anecdotes of painters who have resided or been born in England;: with critical remarks on their productions;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=62IGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA75|accessdate=15 November 2010|year=1808|publisher=Leigh and Sotheby|pages=75–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the subject of an [[epistle]] by [[Tobias Smollett]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let candid Justice our attention lead,&lt;br /&gt;
to the soft crayon of the graceful Read.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and praised by [[William Hayley]].&lt;ref name="Steuart" /&gt;

Miss Read resided in St. James's Place, London until 1766, when she removed to [[Jermyn Street]]. In 1771 she went to [[India]] with her niece, [[Helena Beatson]], a clever young artist, who there married, in 1777, (Sir) [[Sir Charles Oakeley, 1st Baronet|Charles Oakeley]], bart., governor of [[Madras]].&lt;ref name=DNB00 /&gt; She is reported as being in that country in 1775 and 1777, and as dying at sea near [[Madras]].&lt;ref name="Caw2009" /&gt;

Her death is recorded as 15 December 1778.&lt;ref name=DNB00/&gt;

==Works==

In 1763 she exhibited a portrait of [[Queen Charlotte]] with the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|infant Prince of Wales]], and in 1765 one of the latter with his brother, [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Prince Frederick]].

On resuming her practice, Miss Read settled in [[Welbeck Street]]. Many of her portraits were well engraved by [[Valentine Green]] and James Watson, and a pair of plates, by J. Finlayson&lt;!-- N? --&gt;, of the celebrated Gunning sisters, the [[Elizabeth Campbell, 1st Baroness Hamilton of Hameldon|Duchess of Argyll]] and the [[Maria Coventry, Countess of Coventry|Countess of Coventry]], remained popular.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson Willing, {{gutenberg|16079|Some Old Time Beauties}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some works by Read have at one time been attributed to [[Joshua Reynolds]].&lt;ref name=Steuart/&gt; A portrait of [[Lady Georgiana Spencer]] has been noted as one of her finest.&lt;ref name="Caw2009" /&gt;

A '''cephalic presentation''' or '''head presentation''' or '''head-first presentation''' is a situation at [[childbirth]] where the fetus is in a [[presentation (obstetrics)|longitudinal lie]] and  the  [[head]] enters the pelvis first;  the most common form of cephalic presentation is the vertex presentation where the [[occiput]] is the leading part (the part that first enters the birth canal).&lt;ref name=william1&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Hellman LM, Pritchard JA |title=Williams Obstetrics, 14th edition.| publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts (1971)  Library of Congress Catalogue Card Number 73-133179| pages=322–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other presentations are abnormal ([[malpresentation]]s) which are either more difficult to deliver or not deliverable by natural means.

==Engagement==
The movement of the fetus to cephalic presentation is called ''head engagement''. It occurs in the [[third trimester]]. In head engagement, the fetal head descends into the [[pelvic cavity]] so that only a small part (or none) of it can be felt abdominally. The perineum and cervix are further flattened and the head may be felt vaginally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pregnancy-bliss.co.uk/headengagement.html|publisher=pregnancy-bliss.co.uk|title=Starting labour|accessdate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Head engagement is known colloquially as the ''baby drop''&lt;!--Difficult to get Wikipedia search results for "baby drop," and "lightening" redirects to "lightning."--&gt;, and in natural medicine as the ''lightening'' because of the release of pressure on the upper abdomen and renewed ease in breathing. However, it severely reduces bladder capacity, increases pressure on the pelvic floor and the rectum, and the mother may experience the perpetual sensation that the fetus will "fall out" at any moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lightening During Pregnancy as an Early Sign of Labor|url=http://www.givingbirthnaturally.com/lightening-during-pregnancy.html|accessdate=22 August 2010|publisher=Giving Birth Naturally}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
In the vertex presentation the head is [[flexion|flexed]] and the [[occiput]] leads the way. This is the most common configuration and seen at term in 95% of singletons.&lt;ref name=william1/&gt; If the head is extended, the [[face]] becomes the leading part. Face presentations account for less than 1% of presentations at term. In the sinicipital presentation the large [[fontanelle]] is the presenting part; with further labor the head will either flex or extend more so that in the end this presentation leads to a vertex or face presentation.&lt;ref name=william1/&gt; In the brow presentation the head is slightly extended, but less than in the face presentation. The chin presentation is a variant of the face presentation with maximum extension of the head.
 
Non-cephalic presentations are the [[breech presentation]] (3.5%) and the [[shoulder presentation]] (0.5%).&lt;ref name=william1/&gt;

===Vertex presentation===
The vertex is the area of the vault bounded anteriorly by the anterior fontanelle and the coronal suture, posteriorly by the posterior fontanelle and the lambdoid suture and laterally by 2 lines passing through the parietal eminences.

In the vertex presentation the occiput typically is anterior and thus in an optimal position to negotiate the [[pelvic]] curve by extending the head. In an occiput posterior position, labor becomes prolonged and more operative interventions are deemed necessary.&lt;ref name=gardberg&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Gardberg M, Tuppurainen M | title=Persitent occiput posterior presentation &amp;mdash; a clinical problem |journal=Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand  |pmid=7975796| year=1994| volume=198| issue=4| pages=117–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of the persistent occiput posterior is given as 4.7%&lt;ref name=gardberg/&gt;

The vertex presentations are further classified according to the  position of the occiput, it being right, left, or transverse, and anterior or posterior: 
*Left Occipito-Anterior (LOA), Left Occipito-Posterior (LOP), Left Occipito-Transverse (LOT);
*Right Occipito-Anterior (ROA), Right Occipito-Posterior (ROP), Right Occipito-Transverse (ROT);

The Occipito-Anterior position is ideal for birth - it means that the baby is lined up so as to fit through the pelvis as easily as possible. The baby is head down, facing the spine, with its back anterior. In this position, the baby's chin is tucked onto its chest, so that the smallest part of its head will be applied to the cervix first. The position is usually "Left Occiput Anterior", or LOA. Occasionally, the baby may be "Right Occiput Anterior", or ROA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homebirth.org.uk/ofp.htm |title=Optimum Foetal Positioning |accessdate=|publisher=Homebirth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Face presentation===
[[File:Smellie XXV.JPG|right|thumb |150 px|A mento-posterior face presentation, [[William Smellie (obstetrician)|William Smellie]], 1792]]  
Factors that predispose to face presentation are [[preterm|prematurity]], [[macrosomia]], [[anencephaly]] and other malformations, [[cephalopelvic disproportion]], and [[polyhydramnios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bashiri A, Burstein E, Bar-David J, Levy A, Mazor M |title=Face and brow presentation: independent risk factors.|journal=J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med  |pmid=18570114 |year=2008 |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=357–60 |doi=10.1080/14767050802037647}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=duff&gt;{{cite journal| author=Duff, P| title=Diagnosis and Management of Face Presentation| journal=Obstet Gynecol  |pmid=7005774| year=1981| volume=57| issue=1| pages=105–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an uncomplicated face presentation duration of labor is not altered. Perinatal losses with face presentation occur with traumatic [[version and extraction]] and [[forceps delivery|midforceps]] procedures&lt;ref name=duff/&gt; Duff indicates that the prevalence of face presentations is about 1/500&amp;ndash;600.,&lt;ref name=duff/&gt; while Benedetti et al. found it to be 1/1,250 term deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Benedetti TJ, Lowensohn RL, Tuscott AM |title=Face Presentation at Term |journal=Obstet Gynecol  |pmid=7352081| year=1980| volume=55| issue=2| pages=199–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Face presentations are classified according to the position of the [[chin]] (mentum):
*Left Mento-Anterior (LMA), Left Mento-Posterior (LMP), Left Mento-Transverse (LMT);
*Right Mento-Anterior (RMA), Right Mento-Posterior (RMP), Right Mento-Transverse (RMT);

===Brow presentation===
While some consider the brow presentation as an intermediate stage towards the face presentation,&lt;ref name=william1/&gt; others disagree. Thus Bhal et al. indicated that both conditions are about equally common (1/994 face and 1/755 brow positions), and that prematurity was more common with face while [[postmaturity]] was more common with brow positions.&lt;ref name=bhal&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Bhal PS, Davies NJ, Chung T| title=A population study of face and brow presentation |journal=J Obstet Gynecol  | pmid=15512065| year=1998| volume=18| issue=3| pages=231–5| doi=10.1080/01443619867371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oskie presentation===
The Oskie presentation is similar to the Occipito-Anterior position, where the baby is head down, facing the spine, with back on the ventral side of the uterus; however, in this position, while the torso is aligned with the mother's longitudinal axis, the legs of the fetus are extended straight along the frontal axis of the mother, as if the baby is creating a right angle with its body. For the Oskie position to occur the baby's head must be far down the pelvis in order to allow room for leg extension, typically the arms are bent, tucked against the baby's body. There are no known complications for labor and delivery. This presentation is rare and is not well researched.

==Reasons for predominance==
The piriform ([[pear]]-shaped) morphology of the [[uterus]] has been given as the major cause for the finding that most singletons favor the cephalic presentation at term.&lt;ref name=william1/&gt; The [[fundus (uterus)|fundus]] is larger and thus a fetus will adapt its position so that the bulkier and more movable podalic pole makes use of it, while the head moves to the opposite site. Factors that influence this positioning include the [[gestation]]al age (earlier in gestation breech presentations are more common as the head is relatively bigger), size of the head, malformations, amount of [[amniotic fluid]], presence of multiple gestations, presence of tumors, and others.

Two-thirds of all vertex presentations are LOA, possibly because of the asymmetry created by the descending [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] that is on the left side of the pelvis {{Citation needed|reason=This is a surprising fact (why LOA vs ROA?) and definitely needs a source.|date=October 2015}}.

==Diagnosis==
Usually performing the [[Leopold maneuver]]s will demonstrate the presentation and possibly the position of the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Lydon-Rochelle M, Albers L, Gotwocia J, Craig E, Qualls C| title=Accuracy of Leopold Maneuvrers in Screening for Malpresentation: A Prospective Study  |journal=Birth |date=02-04-2007 | pmid=8240620| volume=20| issue=3| pages=132–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medical ultrasonography|Ultrasound examination]] delivers the precise diagnosis and may indicate possible causes of a malpresentation. On vaginal examination, the leading part of the fetus becomes identifiable after the [[amniotic sac]] has been broken and the head is descending in the pelvis.

==Management==
Many factors determine the optimal way to deliver a baby. A vertex presentation is the ideal situation for a vaginal birth, however, occiput posterior positions tend to proceed more slowly, often requiring an intervention in the form of [[forcep]]s, vacuum extraction, or [[Cesarean section]].&lt;ref name=gardberg/&gt; In a large study, a majority of brow presentations were delivered by Cesarean section, however, because of 'postmaturity', factors other than labour dynamics may have played a role.&lt;ref name=bhal/&gt; Most face presentations can be delivered vaginally as long as the chin is anterior; there is no increase in fetal or maternal mortality.&lt;ref name=ducarme/&gt; Mento-posterior positions cannot be delivered vaginally in most cases (unless rotated) and are candidates for Cesarean section in contemporary management.&lt;ref name=ducarme&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ducarme G, Ceccaldi PF, Chesnoy V, Robinet G, Gabriel R |title=Face presentation: retrospective study of 32 cases at term |journal=Gynecol Obstet fertil  |pmid=16630740 |year=2006 |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=393–6 |doi=10.1016/j.gyobfe.2005.07.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archbishop Christopher of Albania''' ({{lang-sq|Kryepeshkopi Kristofori i Shqipërisë}}, secular name '''Sotir Kissi'''; 1881, [[Berat]] - June 16, 1959) was the primate of the [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania]] from 1937 to 1948. In 1959 he was found dead by poison.

==Biography==
Kisi was born in [[Berat]] in 1881. In 1937 he became the primate of the [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania]] as successor of [[Visarion Xhuvani]], as authorized by the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]], which recognized the [[Holy Synod]] of the Church of Albania in April 1937. During World War II Kisi backed up the initiative of Italy and the Vatican (subsequently aborted) to unite the Orthodox Church with the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniate Church]].&lt;ref name="Leustean2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lucian Leustean|title=Eastern Christianity and the Cold War, 1945-91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oOht_5bg6UC&amp;pg=PA144|date=22 December 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-86594-1|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kisi and the [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania|OACA]] high hierarchy, in contrast to the stand of many Orthodox clergy and laity, were supportive to the anti-Communist resistance movement after World War II and had previously welcomed the decision from [[Albania under Nazi Germany|German authorities]] of extending the jurisdiction of Albanian church to the [[Eparchy of Raška and Prizren|Diocese of Prizren]] and newly created bishoprics of [[Peshkopi]]a and [[Struga]].

Kisi was found dead, as a result of poisoning, in 1958. His place as a primate was taken by Communist regime faithful, [[Pais Vodica]].&lt;ref name=ARCT&gt;{{cite news|last=Rehabilitation Centre for Trauma and Torture Albania|title=Genocidi Mbi Elitën Intelektuale të Kombit Shqiptar|url=http://www.arct.org/pdf/genocidi-241-270.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4720">'''Conscious automatism (C.A.)''' is a position on the philosophic question that asks whether [[Hard determinism|determinism]], as distinguished from “free will”, can be considered the sole operant principle in human decision making.

Conscious automatism holds that we human beings, like the other animals we generally consider our inferiors, are conscious but respond as [[automata]] to our prior conditioning (within our physiological powers and limitations) in all of our apparently “willed” decisions. According to this view, the “freedom” we exercise in decision making, a uniqueness that convention leads us to believe distinguishes us from the other mammals, is illusory, for our motives are all, without exception, caused, in the manner we concede that all other changes are causally initiated in the world around us.

Thus in epistemology C.A. is the logical conclusion of a strictly determinist explanation of human conduct and denies that our decision making is free in any sense from causal determinants. Conscious automatism, in refusing the compromise long in vogue among philosophers between freedom and determinism, has as its most disturbing corollary the abandonment of ethicists’ traditional reliance upon the notion of moral responsibility as the foundation of most moral systems and criminal justice institutions. It is, therefore, one of the most iconoclastic principles adduced in the history of moral philosophy as well, having profound practical societal consequences if widely accepted.

The term was recently given significant new substance in the book ''Grandest Illusion: The Seductive Myth of Free Will'',&lt;ref&gt;Echo Park Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; by Norman Haughness, which states forcefully the case for acknowledging the power of exceptionless determinism in human behavior. In Grandest Illusion the arguments claiming that the human will is free in any or all cases from total dependence on causal antecedents are analyzed and criticized in an overtly partisan effort to reveal the flaws in their coherence and logical validity. This in contrast to most recent literature in the field, well-exemplified by ''The Oxford Handbook of Free Will'', edited by Robert Kane,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kane, ''The Oxford Handbook of Free Will''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; whose contributors without exception take positions supporting voluntarism or maintaining agnostic reservations.

Haughness contends that freedom of willing is no more than a faith, which he calls “voluntarism“. He claims that, despite having little empirical basis except in unexamined intuition, free will has been accommodated and, indeed, vigorously defended by philosophers in large part because its abandonment is emotively an extremely repellent notion, suggesting loss of personal autonomy to nearly all who contemplate it. Equally intolerable to many is the fear that, without it, moral responsibility would lose its customarily revered place in society and moral chaos would thereupon necessarily ensue. This problem he addresses only briefly, urging that it is only by changing prior conditioning that conduct can be made conducive to decriminalizing society rather than, as at present, by reliance on ethical norms that are simply not present or are defective in most offenders.

The term “conscious automata” was employed as long ago as 1874, by [[Thomas H. Huxley]] in a famous address he delivered in [[Belfast]] titled "On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and Its History". But Huxley’s version of conscious automatism was a compromise. He acknowledged the validity of [[David Hume]]’s attack &lt;ref&gt;David Hume, Treatise of Human Nature, 1739.&lt;/ref&gt; on the popular but illusory notion of a causal nexus, extending it to a firm denial that laws of nature state what “must” occur (admitting only that they state what “will” occur, a distinction that has remained unclear to many). Huxley saw this as an opening to deny that there exist any sort of “iron laws” that necessitate human conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Method and Results: Essays, 1893&lt;/ref&gt; He believed in such abstractions as “spirit” and insisted that we possess enough “freedom” to “do our duty” and “do as we like,” obvious exceptions to a thoroughgoing determinist view of human motivation. Thus, at bottom he supported only a conscious semi-automatism similar to the ambiguous views of most contemporary philosophers.

'''Darren Varley''' (1973–1999) was a man from [[Alberta]], Canada who died after a scuffle with police in a jail cell in Alberta after he was arrested for drunkenness.

==Background==
Born in [[Pincher Creek]], [[Alberta]], Darley was a truck driver who lived in Pincher Creek his entire life.

==Arrest==
On October 2, 1999, he had just finished a long day at work and headed to a local pub where he was to meet his sister. After several hours of drinking, Varley had become intoxicated. At the same time, [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] Constable Michael Ferguson had just finished taking two prospective officers for an extensive ride in his [[police car]], showing them the ins-and-outs of the area. He dropped them off just an hour before the pubs closed at 3 a.m., according to [[the Crown]].

Ferguson received a call from the RCMP dispatcher based in [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] about an intoxicated complainant, Darren Varley, reporting a missing person. Varley phoned from the local hospital where he was checking on his friend, Tuckey, who had been just beaten up in a fight in which both men had been involved in with two other men. The fight had occurred in the pub parking lot as a result of Varley knocking down one of the men's wife.

The drunken Varley had given the RCMP dispatcher the first statement on what he incorrectly believed to be a missing woman, Chandelle. Constable Ferguson decided to arrest Darren Varley for public drunkenness and bring him to the local police detachment.

After placing Varley in the police car, Constable Ferguson returned to the hospital to investigate the [[missing person]]s report. Within minutes Varley had kicked out the police car window&lt;ref name="Hawco20041210"&gt;{{cite court
|id=Hawco20041210

==Death==
While at the police department, and booking Varley into the last jail cell, Constable Ferguson stated that Varley had pulled his bulletproof vest over his head and gained momentary control of his pistol through what experts testified was a little-known defect in the holster design. An altercation occurred at which time Ferguson regained enough control of the gun to fire two quick shots. One grazed the side of Varley's abdomen and the other shot pierced his skull just behind the ear.  Varley, now breathing with severe difficulty, lay wounded on the cell floor while Constable Ferguson called the ambulance, which attended moments later. Varley was airlifted to a [[Calgary]] hospital where he was pronounced dead.

== Court verdict ==
After two attempts by the Crown which both ended in mistrials from [[hung juries]] to try Michael Ferguson for the killing of Darren Varley, a third attempt was made to try him for [[manslaughter]]. Five years after the killing of Darren Varley, Constable Michael Ferguson was found guilty and convicted of [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref&gt;CTV news report [http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20041211/mountie_shooting041210?s_name=&amp;no_ads= "Alta. Mountie gets house arrest in shooting case]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, December 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The mandatory sentence for manslaughter in Canada, is a four-year closed prison term in incidents involving a firearm. Justice Ged Hawco, ruled to make a constitutional exemption to the firearm clause because the police revolver was present as a result of Constable Ferguson's duties and allow Michael Ferguson to serve an exceptional two-year less a day term in his own home. Justice Hawco came to the conclusion that Michael Ferguson fired the first shot in self-defense, but the second shot was unnecessary.

Justice Hawco stated in his Reasons for Judgment, "If I were to place Mr. Ferguson on this ladder of moral culpability, given the facts which the jury must have concluded, he would be on the very lower rungs."&lt;ref name=Hawco20041210 /&gt;

== Sentence overruled ==
On September 26, 2006, the [[Alberta Court of Appeal]] overruled Justice Ged Hawko's decision to allow Ferguson the opportunity to serve his sentence at his house. The court ruled that Ferguson must serve a four-year prison term.&lt;ref&gt;Kerry Williamson, ''Calgary Herald'', [http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=a3fd8341-4184-4b7f-b7e9-1ff1bfc21ff1 "Killer officer ordered to jail: Victim's family pleased Mountie to do 'hard time'"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206132536/http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=a3fd8341-4184-4b7f-b7e9-1ff1bfc21ff1 |date=2007-12-06 }} September 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Family and supporters of Darren Varley expressed disappointment that he may be granted nearly immediate parole, having considered to have served nearly two years under house arrest which would be credited to his prison sentence.

On  September 25, 2006, Ferguson began a four-year prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Reality Based Training Association, [http://www.rbta.net/ferguson.html "Help Officer Mike Ferguson Receive Justice: RCMP Officer Convicted of Manslaughter for Shooting the Prisoner Who Gained Control of His Sidearm - A Grave Miscarriage of Justice"], 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 2007 Ferguson was out on parole and the Supreme Court had agreed to hear Ferguson's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;CBC News [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2007/02/01/mountie-supreme.html Top court to hear appeal of ex-Mountie's manslaughter sentence], February 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the appeal struck down his sentence. According to his lawyer, Noel O'Brien, the decision was based on the conclusion that "where a mandatory minimum sentence amounts to 'cruel and unusual punishment' and thus a violation under s. 12 of the Charter Of Rights, the only option open to a trial judge is to strike down the legislation itself, even if the mandatory punishment would be constitutional in the vast majority of cases. The ruling means that if a law creating a mandatory minimum sentence is unconstitutional for "any" individual, it will be unconstitutional for "all" individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Case files of O'Brien Devlin Markey Macleod Law Firm, [http://www.obriendevlin.com/caseprofiles.htm R. v. Ferguson (2008) 228 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (SCC)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820073623/http://www.obriendevlin.com/caseprofiles.htm |date=2008-08-20 }}, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[machine learning]], the '''Delta rule''' is a [[gradient descent]] learning rule for updating the weights of the inputs to [[artificial neurons]] in a [[Feedforward neural network#Single-layer_perceptron|single-layer neural network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Russell |first=Ingrid |title=The Delta Rule |url=http://uhavax.hartford.edu/compsci/neural-networks-delta-rule.html |publisher=University of Hartford |accessdate=5 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032228/http://uhavax.hartford.edu/compsci/neural-networks-delta-rule.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a special case of the more general [[backpropagation]] algorithm. For a neuron &lt;math&gt;j &lt;/math&gt; with [[activation function]] &lt;math&gt;g(x) &lt;/math&gt;, the delta rule for &lt;math&gt;j &lt;/math&gt;'s &lt;math&gt;i &lt;/math&gt;th weight &lt;math&gt;w_{ji} &lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta w_{ji}=\alpha(t_j-y_j) g'(h_j) x_i  &lt;/math&gt;,

where

{| cellpadding="2"
|
| &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt; is a small constant called ''learning rate''
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;g(x) &lt;/math&gt; is the neuron's activation function
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;t_j &lt;/math&gt; is the target output
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;h_j &lt;/math&gt; is the weighted sum of the neuron's inputs
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;y_j &lt;/math&gt; is the actual output
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;x_i &lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i &lt;/math&gt;th input.
|}

It holds that &lt;math&gt;h_j=\sum x_i w_{ji} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_j=g(h_j) &lt;/math&gt;.

The delta rule is commonly stated in simplified form for a neuron with a linear activation function as 

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta w_{ji}=\alpha(t_j-y_j) x_i  &lt;/math&gt; 

While the delta rule is similar to the [[perceptron]]'s update rule, the derivation is different. The perceptron uses the [[Heaviside step function]] as the activation function &lt;math&gt;g(h)&lt;/math&gt;, and that means that &lt;math&gt;g'(h)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist at zero, and is equal to zero elsewhere, which makes the direct application of the delta rule impossible.

==Derivation of the delta rule==
The delta rule is derived by attempting to minimize the error in the output of the neural network through [[gradient descent]]. The error for a neural network with &lt;math&gt;j &lt;/math&gt; outputs can be measured as 

:&lt;math&gt;E=\sum_{j} \frac{1}{2}(t_j-y_j)^2 &lt;/math&gt;. 

In this case, we wish to move through "weight space" of the neuron (the space of all possible values of all of the neuron's weights) in proportion to the gradient of the error function with respect to each weight. In order to do that, we calculate the [[partial derivative]] of the error with respect to each weight. For the &lt;math&gt;i &lt;/math&gt;th weight, this derivative can be written as 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial E}{ \partial w_{ji} } &lt;/math&gt;.

Because we are only concerning ourselves with the &lt;math&gt;j &lt;/math&gt;th neuron, we can substitute the error formula above while omitting the summation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial E}{ \partial w_{ji} } = \frac{ \partial \left ( \frac{1}{2} \left( t_j-y_j \right ) ^2 \right ) }{ \partial w_{ji} } &lt;/math&gt;

Next we use the [[chain rule]] to split this into two derivatives:

:&lt;math&gt;= \frac{ \partial \left ( \frac{1}{2} \left( t_j-y_j \right ) ^2 \right ) }{ \partial y_j } \frac{ \partial y_j }{ \partial w_{ji} } &lt;/math&gt;

To find the left derivative, we simply apply the general [[power rule]]:

:&lt;math&gt;= - \left ( t_j-y_j \right ) \frac{ \partial y_j }{ \partial w_{ji} } &lt;/math&gt;

To find the right derivative, we again apply the chain rule, this time differentiating with respect to the total input to &lt;math&gt;j &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h_j &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;= - \left ( t_j-y_j \right ) \frac{ \partial y_j }{ \partial h_j } \frac{ \partial h_j }{ \partial w_{ji} } &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the output of the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th neuron, &lt;math&gt;y_j &lt;/math&gt;, is just the neuron's activation function &lt;math&gt;g &lt;/math&gt; applied to the neuron's input &lt;math&gt;h_j &lt;/math&gt;. We can therefore write the derivative of &lt;math&gt;y_j &lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;h_j &lt;/math&gt; simply as &lt;math&gt;g &lt;/math&gt;'s first derivative:

:&lt;math&gt;= - \left ( t_j-y_j \right ) g'(h_j) \frac{ \partial h_j }{ \partial w_{ji} } &lt;/math&gt;

Next we rewrite &lt;math&gt;h_j &lt;/math&gt; in the last term as the sum over all &lt;math&gt;k &lt;/math&gt; weights of each weight &lt;math&gt;w_{jk} &lt;/math&gt; times its corresponding input &lt;math&gt;x_k &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;= - \left ( t_j-y_j \right ) g'(h_j) \frac{ \partial \left ( \sum_{k} x_k w_{jk} \right ) }{ \partial w_{ji} } &lt;/math&gt;

Because we are only concerned with the &lt;math&gt;i &lt;/math&gt;th weight, the only term of the summation that is relevant is &lt;math&gt;x_i w_{ji} &lt;/math&gt;. Clearly, 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \partial x_i w_{ji} }{ \partial w_{ji} }=x_i &lt;/math&gt;, 

giving us our final equation for the gradient:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial E}{ \partial w_{ji} } = - \left ( t_j-y_j \right ) g'(h_j) x_i &lt;/math&gt;

As noted above, gradient descent tells us that our change for each weight should be proportional to the gradient. Choosing a proportionality constant &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt; and eliminating the minus sign to enable us to move the weight in the negative direction of the gradient to minimize error, we arrive at our target equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta w_{ji}=\alpha(t_j-y_j) g'(h_j) x_i &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Emily May Gibson Braerton''' (January 14, 1884 – 1966) (née Emily May Gibson) was an early advocate of historic preservation in the western United States. She was the Vice President General for the [[National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution]] (DAR) from 1950–1953 and remained an Honorary Vice President General until her death in Santa Ana, California in 1966. She was a member of the DAR’s Peace Pipe Chapter and served as Colorado State Regent from 1950–1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coloradodar.org/StateRegents/stateregents4.htm |title=1944–1961 |publisher=Coloradodar.org |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Braerton was born on January 14, 1884 in [[Council Grove, Kansas]] to Albert Eugene Gibson (Tiffin, Ohio 1851–1909) and Lillian Griffith (Tiffin, Ohio 1851–1939). She was the great niece of [[William Harvey Gibson]], the "Silver Tongued Orator" and Union Army Brigadier General from Ohio. She was a direct descendant of [[John Gibson (American soldier)|Colonel John Gibson]], a U.S. Revolutionary officer and of [[Robert Coe (colonist)|Robert Coe]], who arrived in Boston in 1634.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, J. G. (1911). Robert Coe, puritan: His ancestors and descendants, 1340–1910, with notices of other Coe families.

During Braerton’s tenure as national vice president, the DAR worked to redress denying [[Marian Anderson]] the right to perform at Constitution Hall in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/taggard/anderson.htm |title=Marian Anderson |publisher=English.illinois.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 14 March 1953, Anderson sang to an unsegregated audience in Constitution Hall as part of the American University concert series.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dar.org/natsociety/marian_anderson_and_dar.cfm |title=National Society – Marian Anderson and the |publisher=DAR |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This performance was repeated at Constitution Hall on 1 April 1956.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  On 24 October 1964, Anderson began her farewell American tour from Constitution Hall.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published: April 23, 1993 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/23/opinion/l-the-real-marian-anderson-dar-story-090093.html |title=The Real Marian Anderson-D.A.R.

Braerton was particularly supportive of issues concerning the disabled. She was the mother of five daughters (Emily Louise, Lillian Joan, Mary Lee, Susan Frances, and Lucy Jean), one of whom died in infancy and another one suffered from cerebral palsy caused by premature birth. She was married to Warder Lee Braerton, a law graduate of the University of Kansas (1903) and partner in Braerton, Simonton &amp; Brown Insurance based in Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref name="autogenerated394"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mary Lee Braerton Carroll: Memories of my Life," unpublished paper, Grand Rapids, MI, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kn_OAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA394&amp;lpg=PA394&amp;dq=emily+gibson+braerton+kansas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hiMBc5R1Ga&amp;sig=RSKn6rMgqa7EBp3J1fdhIPEBlnI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EM9VTZWzFcK78ga6jYWXBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=emily%20gibson%20braerton%20kansas&amp;f=false The Graduate Magazine of University of Kansas], volume 12, page 394, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abm2.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo showing a boy jumping into a body of water. It is widely believed that humans make decisions (e.g. jumping in the water) based on free will.]]

'''Free will''' is the ability to [[Choice|choose]] between different possible courses of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] unimpeded.&lt;ref&gt;Omoregie, J. (2015).
 Freewill: The degree of freedom within. UK: Author House | {{ISBN|9781504987516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hegeler, Edward C. (1910). ''The Monist'', Vol. 20. Open Court. p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free will is closely linked to the concepts of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], [[praise]], [[Culpability|guilt]], [[sin]], and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/area.12339|title = Demonic geographies| journal=Area| volume=49| issue=4| pages=503–509|year = 2017|last1 = Simandan|first1 = Dragos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"&gt;Baumeister, R.F. and Monroe, A.E., 2014. Recent research on free will: Conceptualizations, beliefs, and processes. In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 50, pp. 1-52). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also connected with the concepts of [[Advice (opinion)|advice]], [[persuasion]], [[deliberation]], and [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]]. Traditionally, only actions that are freely [[Will (philosophy)|will]]ed are seen as deserving credit or blame. There are numerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is conceived, which is a matter of some debate.

Some conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. [[Determinism]] suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived.&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"/&gt; This problem has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism /&gt; and remains a major focus of philosophical debate. This view that conceives free will to be incompatible with determinism is called ''[[incompatibilism]]'' and encompasses both [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarianism]], the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and [[hard determinism]], the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses [[hard incompatibilism]], which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.

In contrast, ''[[compatibilism|compatibilists]]'' hold that free will ''is'' compatible with determinism. Some compatibilists even hold that determinism is ''necessary'' for free will, arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, requiring a sense of ''how'' choices will turn out.&lt;ref name=Carnap&gt;An argument by [[Rudolph Carnap]] described by: {{cite book |title=Research In Psychology: Methods and Design |author=C.

Contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity, such as to direct one's behavior in a way responsive to reason, and there are still further different conceptions of free will, each with their own concerns, sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of determinism a threat to the possibility of free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/compatibilism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Michael|last1=McKenna|first2=D.

A different approach to the dilemma is that of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]], namely, that if the world is deterministic, then our feeling that we are free to choose an action is simply an [[hard determinism|illusion]]. [[Metaphysical libertarianism]] is the form of incompatibilism which posits that [[determinism]] is false and free will is possible (at least some people have free will).&lt;ref name="stanfordcompatibilism" /&gt; This view is associated with [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|non-materialist]] constructions,&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; including both traditional [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance or Cartesian dualism|dualism]], as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; such as the ability to consciously veto an action or competing desire.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"&gt;Libet, (2003).

Below are the classic arguments bearing upon the dilemma and its underpinnings.

===Incompatibilism===
{{Main|Incompatibilism}}
Incompatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are logically incompatible, and that the major question regarding whether or not people have free will is thus whether or not their actions are determined. "Hard determinists", such as [[Baron d'Holbach|d'Holbach]], are those incompatibilists who accept determinism and reject free will. In contrast, "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarians]]", such as [[Thomas Reid]], [[Peter van Inwagen]], and [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true.&lt;ref name="Wagen"&gt;van Invagen, P. (1983) ''An Essay on Free Will''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-824924-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that of hard incompatibilists, which state that free will is incompatible with both [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]].&lt;ref name="Derk1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pereboom, D. |year=2003 |title=Living without Free Will |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sKZ1rAO2BwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=0521791987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an "[[intuition pump]]": if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will.&lt;ref name="Wagen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = J.M. | year = 1983 | title = Incompatibilism | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 121–37 | doi = 10.1007/BF01112527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.&lt;ref name="DD1"/&gt;

Another argument for incompatibilism is that of the "causal chain". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in "voluntary" behavior. They insist, rather, that free will means that man must be the "ultimate" or "originating" cause of his actions. He must be ''[[causa sui]]'', in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his actions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his control. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be the ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, R. (1996) ''The Significance of Free Will'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-512656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C. A. (1957) ''On Selfhood and Godhood'', London: George Allen and Unwin. {{ISBN|0-415-29624-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, J. P. (1943) ''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press. Sartre also provides a psychological version of the argument by claiming that if man's actions are not his own, he would be in ''bad faith''.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has also been challenged by various compatibilist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, R.M. (1994) ''The Metaphysics of Free Will'', Oxford:Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bok, H. (1998) ''Freedom and Responsibility'', Princeton:Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-01566-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third argument for incompatibilism was formulated by [[Carl Ginet]] in the 1960s and has received much attention in the modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we have no control over the events of the past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the ''consequences'' of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the ''consequence argument''.&lt;ref&gt;Ginet, C. (1966) "Might We Have No Choice?" In Lehrer, 1966: 87–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ving"&gt;Van Inwagen, P. and Zimmerman, D. (1998) ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Peter van Inwagen remarks that C.D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Inwagen, P. (n.d.) [http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc "How to think about free will"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911064556/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc |date=2008-09-11 }}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of this argument for some compatibilists lies in the fact that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of "incredible abilities", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its "decider".&lt;ref name="Ving"/&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if ''different circumstances'' had actually obtained in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-2567.1981.tb00473.x | last1 = Lewis | first1 = D. | year = 2008| title = Are We Free to Break the Laws? | url = | journal = Theoria | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 113–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ''T'', ''F'' for "true" and "false" and ''?'' for undecided, there are exactly nine positions regarding determinism/free will that consist of any two of these three possibilities:&lt;ref name=Strawson&gt;

''Incompatibilism'' may occupy any of the nine positions except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to ''soft determinism''. Position (1) is ''hard determinism'', and position (2) is ''libertarianism''. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that ''D'' implies ''FW'' is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that ''FW'' implies ''D'' is untrue. Position (9) may be called ''hard incompatibilism'' if one interprets ''?'' as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. ''Compatibilism'' itself may occupy any of the nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both may be true or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to ''compatibilism'' is that some form of determinism is true and yet we have some form of free will, position (3).&lt;ref name=FischerFour2009&gt;{{cite book |pages=44 ''ff'' |author= Fischer, John Martin |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |isbn=1405134860 |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Chapter 2: Compatibilism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Rosenberg|Alex Rosenberg]] makes an extrapolation of physical determinism as inferred on the macroscopic scale by the behaviour of a set of dominoes to neural activity in the brain where; "If the brain is nothing but a complex physical object whose states are as much governed by physical laws as any other physical object, then what goes on in our heads is as fixed and determined by prior events as what goes on when one domino topples another in a long row of them."&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Determinism#Quantum mechanics and classical physics|Physical determinism]] is currently disputed by prominent [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]] of [[quantum mechanics]], and while not necessarily representative of intrinsic [[indeterminism]] in nature, fundamental limits of precision in measurement are inherent in the [[uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name="Bohr1"/&gt; The relevance of such prospective indeterminate activity to free will is, however, contested,&lt;ref name="Bohr"/&gt; even when chaos theory is introduced to magnify the effects of such microscopic events.&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1142/S0219635206001112 | last=Lewis | first=E.R. |author2=MacGregor, R.J. | year=2006 | title=On Indeterminism, Chaos, and Small Number Particle Systems in the Brain | journal=[[Journal of Integrative Neuroscience]] | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=223–47 |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lewis/LewisMacGregor.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although hard determinism generally refers to [[nomological determinism]] (see causal determinism below), it can include all forms of determinism that necessitate the future in its entirety.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt; Relevant forms of determinism include:

If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4975.1993.tb00266.x | last1 = Suppes | first1 = P. | year = 1993 | title = The Transcendental Character of Determinism | url = | journal = Midwest Studies in Philosophy | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 242–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=determinism&gt;

;[[Logical determinism]]: The notion that all [[proposition]]s, whether about the past, present or future, are either true or false. The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how choices can be free, given that what one does in the future is already determined as true or false in the present.&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt;
;[[Theological determinism]]: The idea that the future is already determined, either by a [[creator deity]] decreeing or [[omniscience|knowing]] its outcome in advance.&lt;ref name = "FischerGod1989"&gt;Fischer, John Martin (1989) ''God, Foreknowledge and Freedom''.

Other forms of determinism are more relevant to compatibilism, such as [[biological determinism]], the idea that all behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by our genetic endowment and our biochemical makeup, the latter of which is affected by both genes and environment, [[cultural determinism]] and [[psychological determinism]].&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt; Combinations and syntheses of determinist theses, such as bio-environmental determinism, are even more common.

Red circles represent mental states; blue circles represent physical states; arrows describe causal interaction.]]

[[libertarianism (metaphysics)|Metaphysical libertarianism]] is one philosophical view point under that of incompatibilism. Libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires that the [[agency (philosophy)|agent]] be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances.

Accounts of libertarianism subdivide into non-physical theories and physical or naturalistic theories. Non-physical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, which requires that the world is not closed under physics. This includes [[interactionist dualism]], which claims that some non-physical [[mind]], will, or [[soul]] overrides physical [[causality]]. Physical determinism implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will. As consequent of incompatibilism, metaphysical libertarian explanations that do not involve dispensing with [[physicalism]] require physical indeterminism, such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior&amp;nbsp;– theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will. Incompatibilist theories can be categorised based on the type of indeterminism they require; uncaused events, non-deterministically caused events, and agent/substance-caused events.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Randolph |first=Clarke |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Incompatibilist (Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Fall 2008 | year=2008 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/incompatibilism-theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-causal theories====
Non-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will do not require a free action to be caused by either an agent or a physical event. They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed, or physical indeterminism. Non-causal accounts often claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition&amp;nbsp;– a willing, trying, or endeavoring on behalf of the agent (such as the cognitive component of lifting one's arm).&lt;ref name=LumerNannini2007&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Lumer|author2=Sandro Nannini|title=Intentionality, Deliberation and Autonomy: The Action-Theoretic Basis of Practical Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LzldxvSk4kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=30 November 2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6058-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCann1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh McCann|title=The Works of Agency: On Human Action, Will, and Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7HZT-MrFvwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8583-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions. It has been suggested, however, that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over anything in particular. According to non-causal accounts, the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events, including desire, belief, intention of something in particular, but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity. The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom&amp;nbsp;– intentional actions are rather self-generating. The "actish feel" of some intentional actions do not "constitute that event's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control", rather they "might be brought about by direct stimulation of someone's brain, in the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that person".&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; Another question raised by such non-causal theory, is how an agent acts upon reason, if the said intentional actions are spontaneous.

Some non-causal explanations involve invoking [[panpsychism]], the theory that a quality of [[mind]] is associated with all particles, and pervades the entire universe, in both animate and inanimate entities.

====Event-causal theories====

Event-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like those of the compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent. A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created, referenced here as ''deliberative indeterminism'', ''centred accounts'', and ''efforts of will theory''.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the "elbow room" that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.

''Deliberative indeterminism'' asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process.&lt;ref name=Ekstrom2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Waddell Ekstrom|title=Free Will: A Philosophical Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaOpa7qlz3kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-9093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mele2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred R.

The selection process is deterministic, although it may be based on earlier preferences established by the same process. Deliberative indeterminism has been referenced by [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref name="Dennett1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Clement Dennett|title=Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xwObaAZEwoC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=13 July 1981|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Martin Fischer]].&lt;ref name="L.

''Centred accounts'' propose that for any given decision between two possibilities, the strength of reason will be considered for each option, yet there is still a probability the weaker candidate will be chosen.&lt;ref name=Kane2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BRiQgAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514970-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Balaguer1999&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark Balaguer |title=Libertarianism as a Scientifically Reputable View |journal= Philosophical Studies |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=189–211 |year=1999 |doi=10.1023/a:1004218827363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nozick1981&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Nozick|title=Philosophical Explanations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4zH86WogYwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1981|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-66479-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorabji1980&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Sorabji|title=Necessity, Cause, and Blame: Perspectives on Aristotle's Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8tmAAAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1980|publisher=Duckworth|isbn=978-0-7156-1549-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Inwagen1983&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Van Inwagen|title=An Essay on Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=of1sJaUSdcYC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1983|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-824924-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiggins1973&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Honderich|title=Essays on Freedom of Action:Towards a Reasonable Libertarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qY9AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1973|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-7100-7392-1|pages=33–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Searle2001&gt;{{cite book|author=John R.

''Efforts of will theory'' is related to the role of will power in decision making. It suggests that the indeterminacy of agent volition processes could map to the indeterminacy of certain physical events&amp;nbsp;– and the outcomes of these events could therefore be considered caused by the agent. Models of [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism. An example of this approach is that of [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], where he hypothesizes that "in each case, the indeterminism is functioning as a hindrance or obstacle to her realizing one of her purposes&amp;nbsp;– a hindrance or obstacle in the form of resistance within her will which must be overcome by effort."&lt;ref name="RKane1"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Four Views on Free Will (Libertarianism)| last=Kane| first=Robert|author2=John Martin Fischer |author3=Derk Pereboom |author4=Manuel Vargas | year=2007| publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford UK| page=39| isbn=1-4051-3486-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Kane such "ultimate responsibility" is a required condition for free will.&lt;ref name="Kane1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=The Significance of Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhuyeYKsWAkC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor in such a theory is that the agent cannot be reduced to physical neuronal events, but rather mental processes are said to provide an equally valid account of the determination of outcome as their physical processes (see [[non-reductive physicalism]]).

Although at the time [[quantum mechanics]] (and physical [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminism]]) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, in his book [[Miracles (book)|''Miracles: A preliminary study'']] C.S. Lewis stated the logical possibility that if the physical world were proved indeterministic this would provide an entry point to describe an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality.&lt;ref name="CSLewis1"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Lewis, C.S. | title=Miracles | year=1947| page=24| isbn=0-688-17369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indeterminism|Indeterministic]] physical models (particularly those involving [[quantum indeterminacy]]) introduce random occurrences at an atomic or subatomic level. These events might affect brain activity, and could seemingly allow [[Incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will if the apparent indeterminacy of some mental processes (for instance, subjective perceptions of control in conscious [[Volition (psychology)|volition]]) map to the underlying indeterminacy of the physical construct. This relationship, however, requires a causative role over probabilities that is questionable,&lt;ref name=quantum&gt;{{cite book |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |chapter=Libertarianism |author= Kane, Robert|page=9 |quote=It would seem that undetermined events in the brain or body would occur ''spontaneously'' and would be more likely to ''undermine'' our freedom rather than ''enhance'' it. |isbn=1405134860 |year=2007 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is far from established that brain activity responsible for human action can be affected by such events. Secondarily, these incompatibilist models are dependent upon the relationship between action and conscious volition, as studied in the [[neuroscience of free will]]. It is evident that observation may disturb the outcome of the observation itself, rendering limited our ability to identify causality.&lt;ref name=Bohr1&gt;{{cite web |author=Niels Bohr |title= The Atomic Theory and the Fundamental Principles underlying the Description of Nature; ''Based on a lecture to the Scandinavian Meeting of Natural Scientists and published in Danish in Fysisk Tidsskrift in 1929.

Secondly, it has been questioned whether physical events can be caused by an external substance or mind&amp;nbsp;– a common problem associated with [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|interactionalist dualism]].

====Hard incompatibilism====
Hard incompatibilism is the idea that free will cannot exist, whether the world is deterministic or not. [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] has defended hard incompatibilism, identifying a variety of positions where free will is irrelevant to indeterminism/determinism, among them the following:
:#Determinism (D) is true, D does not imply we lack free will (F), but in fact we do lack F.
:#D is true, D does not imply we lack F, but in fact we don't know if we have F.
:#D is true, and we do have F.
:#D is true, we have F, and F implies D.
:#D is unproven, but we have F.
:#D isn't true, we do have F, and would have F even if D were true.
:#D isn't true, we don't have F, but F is compatible with D.
::::::Derk Pereboom, ''Living without Free Will'',&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt; p. xvi.
Pereboom calls positions 3 and 4 ''soft determinism'', position 1 a form of ''hard determinism'', position 6 a form of ''classical libertarianism'', and any position that includes having F as ''compatibilism''.

[[John Locke]] denied that the phrase "free will" made any sense (compare with [[theological noncognitivism]], a similar stance on the [[existence of God]]). He also took the view that the truth of determinism was irrelevant. He believed that the defining feature of voluntary behavior was that individuals have the ability to ''postpone'' a decision long enough to reflect or deliberate upon the consequences of a choice: "... the will in truth, signifies nothing but a power, or ability, to prefer or choose".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, J. (1689). ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1998, ed). Book II, Chap. XXI, Sec. 17. Penguin Classics, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary philosopher [[Galen Strawson]] agrees with Locke that the truth or falsity of determinism is irrelevant to the
problem.&lt;ref name="GStraw"&gt;Strawson, G. (1998, 2004). "Free will". In E. Craig (ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge. Retrieved August 17, 2006, [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 ((online))] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the notion of free will leads to an infinite regress and is therefore senseless.
According to Strawson, if one is responsible for what one does in a given situation, then one must be responsible for the way one is in certain mental respects. But it is impossible for one to be responsible for the way one is in any respect. This is because to be responsible in some situation ''S'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''. To be responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and so on. At some point in the chain, there must have been an act of origination of a new causal chain. But this is impossible. Man cannot create himself or his mental states ''[[ex nihilo]]''. This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view "pessimism" but it can be classified as [[hard incompatibilism]].&lt;ref name="GStraw"/&gt;

====Related philosophical issues====

=====High-level determinism and free will=====
======Causal determinism======
{{Main|Determinism}}

Causal determinism is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|events]] within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or [[Causa sui|self-caused]]. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. [[Quantum mechanics]] poses a serious challenge to this view.

Fundamental debate continues over whether the physical universe is likely to be [[causal determinism|deterministic]]. Although the scientific method cannot be used to rule out [[indeterminism]] with respect to violations of [[causal closure]], it can be used to identify indeterminism in natural law. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] at present are both [[deterministic system|deterministic]] and [[indeterminism|indeterministic]], and are being constrained by ongoing experimentation.&lt;ref name=GroblacherPaterek2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groblacher|first1=Simon|last2=Paterek|first2=Tomasz|last3=Kaltenbaek|first3=Rainer|last4=Brukner|first4=Caslav|last5=Zukowski|first5=Marek|last6=Aspelmeyer|first6=Markus|last7=Zeilinger|first7=Anton|title=An experimental test of non-local realism|journal=Nature|volume=446|issue=7138|year=2007|pages=871–75|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature05677|pmid=17443179|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.2529|arxiv=0704.2529|bibcode=2007Natur.446..871G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Destiny and fate======
{{Main|Destiny}}

Destiny or fate is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. It is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the cosmos.

Although often used interchangeably, the words "fate" and "destiny" have distinct connotations.

[[Fate]] generally implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to [[determinism]], but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally (see for instance [[theological determinism]]). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.

[[Destiny]] implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, but does not of itself make any claim with respect to the setting of that course (i.e., it does not necessarily conflict with [[incompatibilist]] free will). Free will if existent could be the mechanism by which that destined outcome is chosen (determined to represent destiny).&lt;ref name="Blackwell2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben C. Blackwell|title=Christosis: Pauline Soteriology in Light of Deification in Irenaeus and Cyril of Alexandria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDZxSq9nx4IC|accessdate=8 December 2012|date=21 December 2011|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-151672-6|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Logical determinism======
{{See also|B-theory of time}}
Discussion regarding destiny does not necessitate the existence of supernatural powers. Logical [[determinism]] or determinateness is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either true or false), and is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]].

======Omniscience======
{{Main|Omniscience}}

[[Omniscience]] is the capacity to know everything that there is to know (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level [[predeterminism]] such as hard [[theological determinism]] or [[predestination]]&amp;nbsp;– that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot be their own, as is the case with libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an [[incompatible-properties argument]] for the existence of [[God]], known as the [[argument from free will]], and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of [[omnipotence]] with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were going to choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).

=====Predeterminism=====
{{Main|Predeterminism}}
{{See also|Predestination}}

[[Predeterminism]] is the idea that all events are determined in advance.&lt;ref name="McKewan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McKewan |first=Jaclyn |editor=H. James Birx"|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Time: Science, Philosophy, Theology, &amp; Culture |title=Predeterminism |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications|doi=10.4135/9781412963961.n191 |pages=1035–36|chapter=Evolution, Chemical |isbn=9781412941648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries |title=Predeterminism |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/predeterminism |accessdate=20 December 2012 |date=April 2010 |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries}}.

Predeterminism is frequently taken to mean that human actions cannot interfere with (or have no bearing on) the outcomes of a pre-determined course of events, and that one's destiny was established externally (for example, exclusively by a creator deity). The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking [[causal determinism]], implying that there is an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]] stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 September 2009 &lt;!-- date found by checking page's source code where format of date given as m.d.y --&gt;|work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

The term predeterminism suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). While determinism usually refers to a naturalistically explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a "someone" who is controlling or planning the causality of events before they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. [[Predestination]] asserts that a supremely powerful being has indeed fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance, and is a famous doctrine of the [[Calvinists]] in [[Christian]] theology. Predestination is often considered a form of hard [[theological determinism]].

Predeterminism has therefore been compared to [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherman, H. |title=Marx and determinism |quote=Many religions of the world have considered that the path of history is predetermined by God or Fate. On this basis, many believe that what will happen will happen, and they accept their destiny with fatalism. |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |pages=61–71 |year=1981 |jstor=4224996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future.

====Theological determinism====

{{Main|Theological determinism}}

[[Theological determinism]] is a form of [[determinism]] stating that all events that happen are pre-ordained, or [[predestination|predestined]] to happen, by a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[deity]], or that they are destined to occur given its [[omniscience]]. Two forms of theological determinism exist, here referenced as strong and weak theological determinism.&lt;ref name=JordanTate2004&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Lockyer Jordan|author2=Anne Lockyer Jordan Neil Lockyer Edwin Tate|author3=Neil Lockyer|author4=Edwin Tate|title=Philosophy of Religion for A Level OCR Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBVuNip8qjkC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 June 2004|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-8078-5|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first one, strong theological determinism, is based on the concept of a [[creator deity]] dictating all events in history: "everything that happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient, omnipotent divinity."&lt;ref name=Iannone2001&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Pabl Iannone|title=Dictionary of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wBmBO3vpE4C|accessdate=22 December 2012|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-17995-9|page=194|chapter=determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;nbsp;– "because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed."&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (that is, they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J. VanArragon|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyTohO1AMzwC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4411-3867-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of [[causal determinism]], in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Moral Responsibility | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Winter 2009 | year=2009 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/determinism-causal}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to free will and the classification of theological compatibilism/incompatibilism below, "theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true propositions including propositions about our future actions," more minimal criteria designed to encapsulate all forms of theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordincompatibilismarguments"/&gt;

[[File:TheologicalDeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|A simplified [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge" /&gt;]]
There are various implications for [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will as consequent of theological determinism and its philosophical interpretation.
* Strong theological determinism is not compatible with metaphysical libertarian free will, and is a form of ''hard theological determinism'' (equivalent to theological fatalism below). It claims that free will does not exist, and ''God'' has absolute control over a person's actions. Hard theological determinism is similar in implication to [[hard determinism]], although it does not invalidate [[compatibilism|compatibilist]] free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordforeknowledge /&gt; Hard theological determinism is a form of theological incompatibilism (see figure, top left).
* Weak theological determinism is either compatible or incompatible with metaphysical libertarian free will depending upon one's philosophical interpretation of [[omniscience]]&amp;nbsp;– and as such is interpreted as either a form of hard theological determinism (known as [[theological fatalism]]), or as ''soft theological determinism'' (terminology used for clarity only). Soft theological determinism claims that humans have free will to choose their actions, holding that God, while [[omniscience|knowing their actions before they happen]], does not affect the outcome. God's providence is "compatible" with voluntary choice. Soft theological determinism is known as theological compatibilism (see figure, top right). A rejection of theological determinism (or [[omniscience|divine foreknowledge]]) is classified as theological incompatibilism also (see figure, bottom), and is relevant to a more general discussion of free will.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"/&gt;

The basic argument for theological fatalism in the case of weak theological determinism is as follows:
# Assume divine foreknowledge or [[omniscience]]
# [[infallibility|Infallible]] foreknowledge implies destiny (it is known for certain what one will do)
# Destiny eliminates alternate possibility (one cannot do otherwise)
# Assert incompatibility with metaphysical libertarian free will

This argument is very often accepted as a basis for theological incompatibilism: denying either libertarian free will or divine foreknowledge (omniscience) and therefore theological determinism. On the other hand, theological compatibilism must attempt to find problems with it. The formal version of the argument rests on a number of premises, many of which have received some degree of contention. Theological compatibilist responses have included:
* Deny the truth value of [[Problem of future contingents|future contingents]], as proposed for example by [[Aristotle]] (although this denies foreknowledge and therefore theological determinism).
* Assert differences in non-temporal knowledge (space-time independence), an approach taken for example by [[Boethius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Boethius | title=The Consolation of Philosophy | chapter=Book V, Prose vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Aquinas, St. Thomas | title=Summa Theologica | chapter=Ia, q. 14, art 13.}} See [[Summa Theologica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.S. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=C.S. Lewis | title=Mere Christianity | publisher=Touchstone:New York | year=1980 | page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deny the Principle of [[Alternative Possibilities|Alternate Possibilities]]: "If you cannot do otherwise when you do an act, you do not act freely." For example, a human observer could in principle have a machine that could detect what will happen in the future, but the existence of this machine or their use of it has no influence on the outcomes of events.&lt;ref name=zagzebski1991&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|title=The Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v9nLMBtGYcC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 April 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510763-0|chapter=chapter 6, section 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the definition of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]], the literature often fails to distinguish between physical determinism and higher level forms of determinism (predeterminism, theological determinism, etc.) As such, hard determinism with respect to theological determinism (or "Hard Theological Determinism" above) might be classified as hard incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism (if no claim was made regarding the internal causality or determinism of the universe), or even compatibilism (if freedom from the constraint of determinism was not considered necessary for free will), if not hard determinism itself. By the same principle, metaphysical libertarianism (a form of incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism) might be classified as compatibilism with respect to theological determinism (if it was assumed such free will events were pre-ordained and therefore were destined to occur, but of which whose outcomes were not "predestined" or determined by God). If hard theological determinism is accepted (if it was assumed instead that such outcomes were predestined by God), then metaphysical libertarianism is not, however, possible, and would require reclassification (as hard incompatibilism for example, given that the universe is still assumed to be indeterministic&amp;nbsp;– although the classification of hard determinism is technically valid also).&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt;

=====Mind-body problem=====
{{Main|Mind–body problem}}
{{See also|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Monism|Physicalism}}
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[René Descartes]]]]

The idea of ''free will'' is one aspect of the [[Mind–body problem|mind-body problem]], that is, consideration of the relation between [[mind]] (for example, consciousness, memory, and judgment) and body (for example, the [[human brain]] and [[nervous system]]). [[Philosophy of Mind|Philosophical models of mind]] are divided into [[Physicalism|physical]] and non-physical expositions.

[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]] holds that the mind is a nonphysical substance, the seat of consciousness and intelligence, and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body. It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact, each retains some measure of autonomy. Under cartesian dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action, although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events (for example, the instantaneous reaction to being burned).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi&gt;See for example: {{cite book |title=Mind and Causality |chapter=Chapter 5: Mental causation and intentionality in a mind naturalizing theory |author=Sandro Nannini |editor=Alberto Peruzzi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYEPifPTQK4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA77 |pages=69 ''ff'' |isbn=1588114759 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism implies that the physical world is not deterministic&amp;nbsp;– and in which external mind controls (at least some) physical events, providing an interpretation of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will. Stemming from Cartesian dualism, a formulation sometimes called ''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Interactionism|interactionalist dualism]]'' suggests a two-way interaction, that some physical events cause some mental acts and some mental acts cause some physical events. One modern vision of the possible separation of mind and body is the [[Popper's three worlds|"three-world" formulation]] of [[Karl Popper|Popper]].&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;{{cite book |title=All Life is Problem Solving |chapter=Notes of a realist on the body-mind problem |author=Karl Raimund Popper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pa3cZYwdq28C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23 |pages=23 ''ff'' |isbn=0415174864 |year=1999 |publisher=Psychology Press |quote=The body-mind relationship...includes the problem of man's position in the physical world...'World 1'. The world of conscious human processes I shall call 'World 2', and the world of the objective creations of the human mind I shall call 'World 3'. |edition=A lecture given in Mannheim, 8 May 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism and Popper's three worlds are two forms of what is called [[epistemological pluralism]], that is the notion that different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include [[psychophysical parallelism]] and [[epiphenomenalism]]. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is ''not'' reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.

A contrasting approach is called [[physicalism]]. Physicalism is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that everything that [[existence|exists]] is no more extensive than its [[physical properties]]; that is, that there are no non-physical substances (for example physically independent minds). Physicalism can be reductive or non-reductive. [[Reductive physicalism]] is grounded in the idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical, or material, basis. Alternatively, [[non-reductive physicalism]] asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: that mental states (such as [[qualia]]) are not ontologically reducible to physical states. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states are correlated with neurological states. In one such construction, [[anomalous monism]], mental events [[Supervenience|''supervene'']] on physical events, describing the [[emergence]] of mental properties correlated with physical properties&amp;nbsp;– implying causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as [[property dualism]] rather than [[monism]], yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states (see epiphenomenalism).

[[Incompatibilism]] requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will must assert influence on physical reality, and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).

It has been noted that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] have yet to resolve the [[hard problem of consciousness]]:&lt;ref name=Kalat&gt;

===Compatibilism===
{{Main|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]] was a classical compatibilist.]]

Compatibilists maintain that determinism is compatible with free will. They believe freedom can be present or absent in a situation for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. For instance, [[courts of law]] make judgments about whether individuals are acting under their own free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, [[political liberty]] is a non-metaphysical concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sauve Meyer, ''Aristotle on Moral Responsibility.'', Oxford 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stoic Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien|Bobzien, Susanne]], ''Freedom and Determinism in Stoic Philosophy'', Oxford 1998, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] positions are concerned with a sort of "metaphysically free will", which compatibilists claim has never been coherently defined. Compatibilists argue that determinism does not matter; though they disagree among themselves about what, in turn, ''does'' matter. To be a compatibilist, one need not endorse any particular conception of free will, but only deny that determinism is at odds with free will.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"&gt;McKenna, Michael, "Compatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2004/entries/compatibilism/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are various impediments to exercising one's choices, free will does not imply freedom of action. Freedom of choice (freedom to select one's will) is logically separate from freedom to ''implement'' that choice (freedom to enact one's will), although not all writers observe this distinction.&lt;ref name="OConnor"/&gt; Nonetheless, some philosophers have defined free will as the absence of various impediments. Some "modern compatibilists", such as [[Harry Frankfurt]] and [[Daniel Dennett]], argue free will is simply freely choosing to do what constraints allow one to do. In other words, a coerced agent's choices can still be free if such coercion coincides with the agent's personal intentions and desires.&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, D. |year=1984 |title= Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting |publisher= Bradford Books |isbn=0-262-54042-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4NtNzOKxycC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frankfurt&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2024717 | last1=Frankfurt |first1= H. | year=1971 | pages=5–20 |title= Freedom of the Will and the Concept of the Person | issue=1 | volume=68 |journal=Journal of Philosophy |jstor= 2024717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as lack of physical restraint====
Most "classical compatibilists", such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], claim that a person is acting on the person's own will only when it is the desire of that person to do the act, and also possible for the person to be able to do otherwise, ''if the person had decided to''. Hobbes sometimes attributes such compatibilist freedom to each individual and not to some abstract notion of ''will'', asserting, for example, that "no liberty can be inferred to the will, desire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to doe{{sic}}&lt;!-- sic, that is how Hobbes wrote it; don't change to "do". --&gt;."&lt;ref name="Hobbes"&gt;Hobbes, T. (1651) ''Leviathan'' [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html#a_2025807 Chapter XXI.: "Of the liberty of subjects"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122711/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }} (1968 edition). London: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; In articulating this crucial proviso, [[David Hume]] writes, "this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains."&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' Section VIII.: "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html#a_606067 Of liberty and necessity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122708/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }}" (1967 edition). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Voltaire]], in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', claimed that "Liberty then is only and can be only the power to do what one will." He asked, "would you have everything at the pleasure of a million blind caprices?" For him, free will or liberty is "only the power of acting, what is this power? It is the effect of the constitution and present state of our organs."

====Free will as a psychological state====
Compatibilism often regards the agent free as virtue of their reason. Some explanations of free will focus on the internal causality of the mind with respect to higher-order brain processing&amp;nbsp;– the interaction between conscious and unconscious brain activity.&lt;ref name=Baumeister&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages=487 ''ff'' |editor1=Ezequiel Morsella |editor2=John A.

&lt;/ref&gt; Compatibilist free will has also been attributed to our natural [[sense of agency]], where one must believe they are an agent in order to function and develop a [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Smilansky2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saul Smilansky|title=Free Will and Illusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPUTQq7CUfwC|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-825018-0|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallagher | first1 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Philosophical conceptions of the self: implications for cognitive science | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 14–21 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01417-5| pmid = 10637618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of levels of decision is presented in a different manner by Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt; Frankfurt argues for a version of compatibilism called the "hierarchical mesh". The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) to the effect that one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, that is, the one they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are "wanton addicts", "unwilling addicts" and "willing addicts". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not want to take it.

The first group, ''wanton addicts'', have no second-order desire not to take the drug. The second group, "unwilling addicts", have a second-order desire not to take the drug, while the third group, "willing addicts", have a second-order desire to take it. According to Frankfurt, the members of the first group are devoid of will and therefore are no longer persons. The members of the second group freely desire not to take the drug, but their will is overcome by the addiction. Finally, the members of the third group willingly take the drug they are addicted to. Frankfurt's theory can ramify to any number of levels. Critics of the theory point out that there is no certainty that conflicts will not arise even at the higher-order levels of desire and preference.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, D. (1982). ''Free Will''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that Frankfurt offers no adequate explanation of how the various levels in the hierarchy mesh together.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, John Martin, and Mark Ravizza. (1998). ''Responsibility and Control: An Essay on Moral Responsibility''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as unpredictability====
In ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'', Dennett presents an argument for a compatibilist theory of free will, which he further elaborated in the book ''[[Freedom Evolves]]''.&lt;ref name="DD2"&gt;Dennett, D. (2003) ''Freedom Evolves''. Viking Books. {{ISBN|0-670-03186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic reasoning is that, if one excludes God, an infinitely powerful [[demon]], and other such possibilities, then because of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and epistemic limits on the precision of our knowledge of the current state of the world, the future is ill-defined for all finite beings. The only well-defined things are "expectations". The ability to do "otherwise" only makes sense when dealing with these expectations, and not with some unknown and unknowable future.

According to Dennett, because individuals have the ability to act differently from what anyone expects, free will can exist.&lt;ref name="DD2"/&gt; Incompatibilists claim the problem with this idea is that we may be mere "automata responding in predictable ways to stimuli in our environment". Therefore, all of our actions are controlled by forces outside ourselves, or by random chance.&lt;ref name="Kaney"&gt;Kane, R. ''The Oxford Handbook to Free Will''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513336-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated analyses of compatibilist free will have been offered, as have other critiques.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"/&gt;

In the philosophy of [[decision theory]], a fundamental question is: From the standpoint of statistical outcomes, to what extent do the choices of a conscious being have the ability to influence the future? [[Newcomb's paradox]] and other philosophical problems pose questions about free will and predictable outcomes of choices.

====The physical mind====
{{See also|Neuroscience of free will}}

[[Compatibilist]] models of free will often consider deterministic relationships as discoverable in the physical world (including the brain). Cognitive [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]&lt;ref name=naturalism&gt;A key exponent of this view was [[Willard van Orman Quine]]. See {{cite web |title=Willard van Orman Quine |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/quine/ |author=Hylton, Peter |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition) |editor= Edward N. Zalta |date=Apr 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] approach to studying human [[cognition]] and [[consciousness]] in which the mind is simply part of nature, perhaps merely a feature of many very complex self-programming feedback systems (for example, [[neural networks]] and [[Cognitive robotics|cognitive robots]]), and so must be studied by the methods of empirical science, such as the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] and [[cognitive science]]s (''i.e.'' [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]]).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi/&gt;&lt;ref name=physicalism&gt;

A thoughtful list of careful distinctions regarding the application of empirical science to these issues is found in {{cite web |author=Stoljar, Daniel |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/physicalism/#12 |title=Physicalism: §12 – Physicalism and the physicalist world picture |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Sep 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive naturalism stresses the role of neurological sciences. Overall brain health, [[substance dependence]], [[Long-term depression|depression]], and various [[personality disorders]] clearly influence mental activity, and their impact upon [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] is also important.&lt;ref name=Baumeister /&gt; For example, an [[substance abuse|addict]] may experience a conscious desire to escape addiction, but be unable to do so. The "will" is disconnected from the freedom to act. This situation is related to an abnormal production and distribution of [[dopamine]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=Volkow&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The neuroscience of free will places restrictions on both compatibilist and incompatibilist free will conceptions.

Compatibilist models adhere to models of mind in which mental activity (such as deliberation) can be reduced to physical activity without any change in physical outcome. Although compatibilism is generally aligned to (or is at least compatible with) physicalism, some compatibilist models describe the natural occurrences of deterministic deliberation in the brain in terms of the first person perspective of the conscious agent performing the deliberation.&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; Such an approach has been considered a form of identity dualism. A description of "how conscious experience might affect brains" has been provided in which "the experience of conscious free will is the first-person perspective of the neural correlates of choosing."&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt;

Recently{{when|date=August 2018}} [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] developed a neocompatibilist theory based on the causal theory of action that is complementary to classical compatibilism. According to him, physical, psychological and rational restrictions can interfer at different levels of the causal chain that would naturally lead to action. Corrrespondingly, there can be physical restrictions to the body, psychological restrictions to the decision, and rational restrictions to the formation of reasons (desires plus beliefs) that should lead to what we would call a reasonable action. The last two are usually called "restrictions of free will". The restriction at the level of reasons is particularly important, since it can be motivated by external reasons that are insufficiently conscious to the agent. One example was the collective suicide led by [[Jim Jones]]. The suicidal agents were not conscious that their free will have been manipulated by external, even if ungrounded, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa [http://www.example''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''] CSP, 2014, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
Some philosophers' views are difficult to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, [[Ted Honderich]] holds the view that "determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false" and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or things that can be located in space and time, but are [[Abstract object|abstract]] entities. Further, even if they were micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. There are really two notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The "new" problem is how to resolve this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, T. (2001). "Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False and the Real Problem" in ''The Free Will Handbook'', edited by Robert Kane of the University of Texas. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as an illusion====
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|upright|Spinoza thought that there is no free will.]]
:"Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason, that men believe themselves free, simply because they are conscious of their actions, and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined." [[Baruch Spinoza]], ''Ethics''&lt;ref name=Spinoza&gt;{{cite book |author= Benedict de Spinoza |year=2008 |chapter= Part III: On the origin and nature of the emotions; Postulates (Proposition II, Note) |editor= R.H.M.

David Hume discussed the possibility that the entire debate about free will is nothing more than a merely "verbal" issue. He suggested that it might be accounted for by "a false sensation or seeming experience" (a ''velleity''), which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them. On reflection, we realize that they were necessary and determined all along.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1765). ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Indianapolis: Hacket Publishing Co. Second edition. 1993. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] claimed that phenomena have no free will but the will as [[Noumena|noumenon]], is free.]]
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] put the puzzle of free will and moral responsibility in these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone believes himself, ''a priori'', perfectly free&amp;nbsp;– even in his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence another manner of life. ... But ''a posteriori'', through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The Wisdom of Life'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer stated, "You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can ''will'' only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], Arthur, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-14552-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schopenhauer, [[phenomena]] do not have free will. However, [[Will (philosophy)|will]] [urging, craving, striving, wanting, and desiring] as [[Noumena|noumenon]] is free.

====Free will as "moral imagination"====
[[Rudolf Steiner]], who collaborated in a complete edition of Arthur Schopenhauer's work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Schopenhauers sämtliche Werke in zwölf Bänden. Mit Einleitung von Dr. Rudolf Steiner, Stuttgart: Verlag der J.G. Cotta'schen Buchhandlung Nachfolger, o.J. (1894–96)|first=Rudolf|last=Steiner|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kafka/k_s_bibII.html |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''The [[Philosophy of Freedom]]'', which focuses on the problem of free will. Steiner (1861–1925) initially divides this into the two aspects of freedom: ''freedom of thought'' and ''freedom of action''. The controllable and uncontrollable aspects of decision making thereby are made logically separable, as pointed out in the introduction. This separation of ''will'' from ''action'' has a very long history, going back at least as far as [[Stoicism]] and the teachings of [[Chrysippus]] (279–206 BCE), who separated external ''antecedent'' causes from the internal disposition receiving this cause.&lt;ref name=Chrysippus&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lRD6feR3hEC&amp;pg=PA529 |page=529 |chapter=Chapter VI: The Chyrsippean notion of fate: soft determinism |author=Keimpe Algra |isbn=0521250285 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner then argues that inner freedom is achieved when we integrate our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, with our thoughts, which lend coherence to these impressions and thereby disclose to us an understandable world. Acknowledging the many influences on our choices, he nevertheless point out that they do not preclude freedom unless we fail to recognise them. Steiner argues that outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with ''moral imagination.” “Moral” in this case refers to action that is willed, while “imagination” refers to the mental capacity to envision conditions that do not already hold. Both of these functions are necessarily conditions for freedom. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, R. (1964). Rudolf Steiner Press, London, 1964, 1970, 1972, 1979, 230 pp., translated from the 12th German edition of 1962 by Michael Wilson. [http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pragmatically useful concept====
[[William James]]' views were ambivalent. While he believed in free will on "ethical grounds", he did not believe that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it.&lt;ref&gt;See Bricklin, Jonathan, "A Variety of Religious Experience: William James and the Non-Reality of Free Will", in Libet (1999), ''The Volitional Brain: Toward a Neuroscience of Free Will'' (Thorverton UK: Imprint Academic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately he believed that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work ''[[Pragmatism]]'', he wrote that "instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise" regardless of metaphysical theories.&lt;ref name="JW"&gt;James, W. (1907) ''Pragmatism'' (1979 edition). Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; He did believe that indeterminism is important as a "doctrine of relief"&amp;nbsp;– it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a bad place, it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines [[meliorism]]&amp;nbsp;– the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.&lt;ref name="JW"/&gt;

====Free will and views of causality====
{{See also|Principle of sufficient reason}}

In 1739, [[David Hume]] in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' approached free will via the notion of causality. It was his position that causality was a mental construct used to explain the repeated association of events, and that one must examine more closely the relation between things ''regularly succeeding'' one another (descriptions of regularity in nature) and things that ''result'' in other things (things that cause or necessitate other things).&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;
{{cite book |title=The significance of free will |author=Robert Kane |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBlXH3FtwJIC&amp;pg=PA226 |page= 226 |chapter=Notes to pages 74–81, note 22 |isbn=0195126564 |year=1998 |edition=Paperback}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hume, 'causation' is on weak grounds: "Once we realise that 'A must bring about B' is tantamount merely to 'Due to their constant conjunction, we are psychologically certain that B will follow A,' then we are left with a very weak notion of necessity."&lt;ref name=Lorkowski&gt;{{cite web |author=CM Lorkowski |date=November 7, 2010 |title=David Hume: Causation |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-cau/ |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This empiricist view was often denied by trying to prove the so-called [[apriority]] of causal law (i.e. that it precedes all experience and is rooted in the construction of the perceivable world):
* [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s proof in ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (which referenced time and time ordering of causes and effects)&lt;ref&gt;Kant argued that, in order that human life is not just a "dream" (a random or projected by subjects juxtaposition of moments), the temporality of event A as before or after B must submit to a rule. An established order then implies the existence of some necessary conditions and causes, that is: sufficient bases (a so-called sufficient reason is the coincidence of all the necessary conditions). Without established causality, both [[Transcendental apperception|in subject]] and in the external world, the passing of time would be impossible, because it is essentially directional. See [[s:Critique of Pure Reason/Volume 1/Division 1#B. SECOND ANALOGY. Principle of the Succession of Time According to the Law of Causality. All changes take place according to the law of the connection of Cause and Effect.|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s proof from ''The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' (which referenced the so-called intellectuality of representations, that is, in other words, objects and [[qualia]] perceived with senses)&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, who by the way continued and simplified Kant's system, argued (among others basing on optical illusions and the "initial processing") that it is the intellect or even the brain what generates the image of the world out of something else, by ''concluding from effects, e.g. optical, about appropriate causes'', e.g. concrete physical objects. Intellect in his works is strictly connected with recognizing causes and effects and associating them, it is somewhat close to the contemporary view of [[cerebral cortex]] and formation of associations. The intellectuality of all perception implied then of course that causality is rooted in the world, precedes and enables experience. See [[s:Page:On the Fourfold Root, and On the Will in Nature.djvu/90|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1780s [[Immanuel Kant]] suggested at a minimum our decision processes with moral implications lie outside the reach of everyday causality, and lie outside the rules governing material objects.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; "There is a sharp difference between moral judgments and judgments of fact.... Moral judgments ... must be ''a priori'' judgments."&lt;ref name=Paton&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman introduces what he calls "circular causality" to "allow for the contribution of self-organizing dynamics", the "formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the patterns of activity of the contributing individuals", applicable to "interactions between neurons and neural masses ... and between the behaving animal and its environment".&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Freeman, Walter J. |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88 |page=88| quote=Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes.... The very strong appeal of agency to explain events may come from the subjective experience of cause and effect that develops early in human life, before the acquisition of language...the question I raise here is whether brains share this property with other material objects in the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, mind and neurological functions are tightly coupled in a situation where feedback between collective actions (mind) and individual subsystems (for example, [[neuron]]s and their [[synapse]]s) jointly decide upon the behaviour of both.

====Free will according to Thomas Aquinas====

Thirteenth century philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] viewed humans as pre-programmed (by virtue of being human) to seek certain goals, but able to choose between routes to achieve these goals (our Aristotelian [[telos (philosophy)|telos]]).

In facing choices, he argued that humans are governed by ''intellect'', ''will'', and ''passions''. The will is "the primary mover of all the powers of the soul ... and it is also the efficient cause of motion in the body."&lt;ref name=Stump&gt;

A discussion of the roles of will, intellect and passions in Aquinas' teachings is found in {{cite book |title=Aquinas, ''Arguments of the philosophers series'' |author= Stump, Eleonore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GvL3eKhoM8C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278 |pages=278 ''ff'' |isbn=0415029600 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge (Psychology Press) |chapter= Intellect and will}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Choice falls into five stages: (i) intellectual consideration of whether an objective is desirable, (ii) intellectual consideration of means of attaining the objective, (iii) will arrives at an intent to pursue the objective, (iv) will and intellect jointly decide upon choice of means (v) will elects execution.&lt;ref name=OConnor0&gt;{{cite web |author=Timothy O'Connor |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/freewill/ |title= Free Will |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor= Edward N.

A compatibilist interpretation of Aquinas's view is defended thus: "Free-will is the cause of its own movement, because by his free-will man moves himself to act. But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause. God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes both natural and voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', Q83 A1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further discussion of this compatibilistic theory can be found in Thomas' ''Summa contra gentiles'', Book III about Providence, c. 88–91 (260–67), where it is postulated that everything has its cause and it is again and again in detail referred also to all individual choices of man etc., even refuting opposite views. [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles3b.htm#88 Here the online text of the Summa]. In order to avoid, at least in concept, the absolution of man of any guilt he then notes the contingency of all that takes place, i.e. lack of ''direct'' necessity from God strictly with regard to a concrete ("contingent") act. A typical choice was not separately ordained to be so-and-so by God; St. Thomas says the choice is not necessary, but in fact that apparently means it was ''contingent'' with regard to God and the law of nature (as a specific case that could have not existed in other circumstances), and ''necessary'' with regard to its direct previous cause in will and intellect. (The contingency, or fortuity, is even intuitive under modern [[chaos theory]], where one can try to show that more and more developed products appearing in the evolution of a universe or, simpler, an automaton are [[chaos theory|chaotic]] with regard to its principles.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pseudo-problem====

Historically, most of the philosophical effort invested in resolving the dilemma has taken the form of close examination of definitions and ambiguities in the concepts designated by "free", "freedom", "will", "choice" and so forth. Defining 'free will' often revolves around the meaning of phrases like [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22ability+to+do+otherwise%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "ability to do otherwise"] or [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22alternative+possibilities%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "alternative possibilities"]. This emphasis upon words has led some philosophers to claim the problem is merely verbal and thus a pseudo-problem.&lt;ref name=Deery&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In response, others point out the complexity of decision making and the importance of nuances in the terminology.

===History of free will===

The problem of free will has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophical]] literature. The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both [[Aristotle]] (fourth century BCE) and [[Epictetus]] (1st century CE); "it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them".&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Determinism and freedom in Stoic philosophy| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 1998| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7kmTeOjHIqkC&amp;pg=PR12|quote="...Aristotle and Epictetus: In the latter authors it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them. In Alexander's account, the terms are understood differently: what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them."| isbn = 9780198237945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Did Epicurus discover the free-will problem?| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2000| url = http://philpapers.org/rec/BOBDED}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Susanne Bobzien]], the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (third century CE); "what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them".

The term "free will" (''liberum arbitrium'') was introduced by Christian philosophy (4th century CE). It has traditionally meant (until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings) lack of necessity in human will,&lt;ref&gt;A. Schopenhauer, ''On the Freedom of the Will'', c. 1, "What is freedom?"&lt;/ref&gt; so that "the will is free" meant "the will does not have to be such as it is". This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.&lt;ref&gt;Hence the notion of contingency appeared as the very opposition of necessity, so that wherever a thing is considered dependent or relies upon another thing, it is contingent and thus not necessary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific approaches==

Science has contributed to the free will problem in at least three ways. First, physics has addressed the question whether nature is deterministic, which is viewed as crucial by incompatibilists (compatibilists, however, view it as irrelevant). Second, although free will can be defined in various ways, all of them involve aspects of the way people make decisions and initiate actions, which have been studied extensively by neuroscientists. Some of the experimental observations are widely viewed as implying that free will does not exist or is an illusion (but many philosophers see this as a misunderstanding). Third, psychologists have studied the beliefs that the majority of ordinary people hold about free will and its role in assigning moral responsibility.

===Quantum physics===
Early scientific thought often portrayed the universe as deterministic&amp;nbsp;– for example in the thought of [[Democritus]] or the [[Cārvāka]]ns&amp;nbsp;– and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient [[physical information|information]] would allow them to predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of deterministic and [[stochastic]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;Boniolo, G. and Vidali, P. (1999) ''Filosofia della Scienza'', Milan: Mondadori. {{ISBN|88-424-9359-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum mechanics]] predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all, although evolution of the universal state vector is completely deterministic. Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world, being very far from a potential [[Theory of Everything]], and open to many different [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations]].&lt;ref name="stanfordcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Carl |last=Hoefer |title=Causal Determinism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is the Universe Deterministic? |first=Vlatko |last=Vedral |volume=192 |issue=2578 |date=2006-11-18 |journal=New Scientist |quote=Physics is simply unable to resolve the question of free will, although, if anything, it probably leans towards determinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that an indeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is for all practical purposes confined to microscopic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwVariousHonderichKanebook.htm |author=Honderich, E.|title= Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False, and the Real Problem |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some [[hardware random number generator]]s work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only a result of complete quantum randomness, and mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition),&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt; According to many interpretations, non-determinism enables free will to exist,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-physics-free-will/&lt;/ref&gt; while others assert the opposite (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/lujan1.html |title=Infidels. "Metaphysical Freedom" |publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Like physicists, [[biology|biologists]] have frequently addressed questions related to free will. One of the most heated debates in biology is that of "[[nature versus nurture]]", concerning the relative importance of genetics and biology as compared to culture and environment in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pin"&gt;Pinel, P. J. (1990) ''Biopsychology''. Prentice Hall Inc. {{ISBN|88-15-07174-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of many researchers is that many human behaviors can be explained in terms of humans' brains, genes, and evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;DeFries, J.C., McGuffin, P., McClearn, G.E., Plomin, R. (2000) ''Behavioral Genetics'' 4th ed. W H Freeman &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. (1967) ''The Naked Ape''. New York:McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-385-33430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawk"&gt;Dawkins, R. (1976) ''The Selfish Gene''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|88-04-39318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view raises the fear that such attribution makes it impossible to hold others responsible for their actions. [[Steven Pinker]]'s view is that fear of determinism in the context of "genetics" and "evolution" is a mistake, that it is "a confusion of ''explanation'' with ''exculpation''". Responsibility does not require that behavior be uncaused, as long as behavior responds to praise and blame.&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''. London: Penguin. p. 179 {{ISBN|0-14-200334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is not certain that environmental determination is any less threatening to free will than genetic determination.&lt;ref name="Lew"&gt;Lewontin, R. (2000). ''It Ain't Necessarily So: The Dream of the Human Genome and other Illusions''. New York: NYREV Inc. {{ISBN|88-420-6418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience and Neurophilosophy===
{{Main|Neurophilosophy|Neuroscience of free will}}
{{see also|Neurostimulation}}

It has become possible to study the living [[Human brain|brain]], and researchers can now watch the brain's decision-making process at work. A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain; in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[readiness potential]] (after German [[Bereitschaftspotential]], which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965. Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflügers Arch 284: 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;) Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action, Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move. To determine when subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock. After making a movement, the volunteer reported the time on the clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move; this became known as Libet's W time.&lt;ref name="LGW" /&gt;

Libet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity of the readiness potential leading up to subjects' movements began approximately half a second before the subject was aware of a conscious intention to move.&lt;ref name="LGW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00044903 | last1 = Libet | first1 = B. | year = 1985 | title = Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 529–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies of the timing between actions and the conscious decision bear upon the role of the brain in understanding free will. A subject's declaration of intention to move a finger appears ''after'' the brain has begun to implement the action, suggesting to some that unconsciously the brain has made the decision ''before'' the conscious mental act to do so. Some believe the implication is that free will was not involved in the decision and is an illusion. The first of these experiments reported the brain registered activity related to the move about 0.2 s before movement onset.&lt;ref name=Libet&gt;

The bearing of these results upon notions of free will appears complex.&lt;ref name=Strother&gt;{{cite journal|title=The conscious experience of action and intention |author1=Lars Strother |author2=Sukhvinder Singh Obhi |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=198 |year=2009 |pages=535–39 |doi=10.1007/s00221-009-1946-7 |url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |issue=4 |pmid=19641911 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217013640/http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Rosenbaum&gt;A brief discussion of possible interpretation of these results is found in {{cite book |title=Human Motor Control |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsFmds_ACBwC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86 |isbn=0123742269 |year=2009 |edition=2nd |publisher=Academic Press |author=David A. Rosenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that placing the question of free will in the context of motor control is too narrow. The objection is that the time scales involved in motor control are very short, and motor control involves a great deal of unconscious action, with much physical movement entirely unconscious. On that basis "... free will cannot be squeezed into time frames of 150–350 ms; free will is a longer term phenomenon" and free will is a higher level activity that "cannot be captured in a description of neural activity or of muscle activation...."&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |author= Gallagher, Shaun|chapter=Chapter 6: Where's the action?

More studies have since been conducted, including some that try to:
* support Libet's original findings
* suggest that the cancelling or "veto" of an action may first arise subconsciously as well
* explain the underlying brain structures involved
* suggest models that explain the relationship between conscious intention and action

[[Benjamin Libet]]'s results are quoted&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wegner|Wegner D.]], 2002. The Illusion of Conscious Will. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012. ''The will and its brain – an appraisal of reasoned free will''. University Press of America, Lanham, MD, {{ISBN|978-0-7618-5862-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that data such as the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is "completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".&lt;ref name="Flanagan1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=O.J. |last=Flanagan |year=1992 |title=Consciousness Reconsidered |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56077-1 |lccn=lc92010057 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFOqQgAACAAJ |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that in several brain-related conditions, individuals cannot entirely control their own actions, though the existence of such conditions does not directly refute the existence of free will. Neuroscientific studies are valuable tools in developing models of how humans experience free will.

For example, people with [[Tourette syndrome]] and related [[tic disorder]]s make involuntary movements and utterances (called [[tic]]s) despite the fact that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or ''unvoluntary'',&lt;ref name=TSADef&gt;Tourette Syndrome Association. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050322170245/http://www.tsa-usa.org/research/definitions.html Definitions and Classification of Tic Disorders.]. Retrieved 19 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; because they are not strictly ''involuntary'': they may be experienced as a ''voluntary'' response to an unwanted, premonitory urge. Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed.&lt;ref name=TSADef/&gt; People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward. The control exerted (from seconds to hours at a time) may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic.&lt;ref name=Zinner&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zinner | first1 = S.H. | year = 2000 | title = Tourette disorder | url = | journal = Pediatric Review | volume = 21 | issue = 11| pmid = 11077021 | pages = 372–83 | doi=10.1542/pir.21-11-372| doi-broken-date = 2018-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[alien hand syndrome]], the afflicted individual's [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] will produce unintentional movements without the will of the person. The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The [[sense of agency]] does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential (see section on the Neuroscience of Free Will above) recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed.&lt;ref name=Kayser&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20771 | last1 = Kayser | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = F.T. | last3 = D'Esposito | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = A comparison of Granger causality and coherency in fMRI-based analysis of the motor system | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 30 | issue = 11| pages = 3475–94 | pmid = 19387980 | pmc = 2767459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sense of agency]] thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex. In particular, the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory pre-movement process. In a recent study using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand, while voluntary movements of the same body part included the natural activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process.&lt;ref name=Assal&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ana.21173 | last1 = Assal | first1 = F. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = S. | last3 = Vuilleumier | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Moving with or without will: Functional neural correlates of alien hand syndrome | url = | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 301–06 | pmid = 17638304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical definition requires "feeling that one limb is foreign or has a ''will of its own,'' together with observable involuntary motor activity" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name=Doody&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.55.9.806 | last1 = Doody | first1 = RS | last2 = Jankovic | first2 = J. | year = 1992 | title = The alien hand and related signs | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 9| pages = 806–10 | pmid = 1402972 | pmc = 1015106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This syndrome is often a result of damage to the [[corpus callosum]], either when it is severed to treat intractable [[epilepsy]] or due to a [[stroke]].

This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else. Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear, one influential hypothesis is that there is a breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the feedback received from the body (known as [[proprioception]]), leading to attendant [[hallucination]]s and [[delusions of control]].&lt;ref name=frith&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0173(99)00052-1 | last1 = Frith | first1 = CD | last2 = Blakemore | first2 = S | last3 = Wolpert | first3 = DM | title = Explaining the symptoms of schizophrenia: abnormalities in the awareness of action | journal = Brain Research.

===Experimental psychology===
{{See also|Cognitive science|Cognitive psychology|Neuroscience}}
[[Experimental psychology]]'s contributions to the free will debate have come primarily through social psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]]'s work on conscious will. In his book, ''The Illusion of Conscious Will''&lt;ref name = "WegnerBook"&gt;Wegner, D.M. (2002). ''The illusion of conscious will.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Wegner summarizes what he believes is [[empirical evidence]] supporting the view that human perception of conscious control is an illusion. Wegner summarizes some empirical evidence that may suggest that the perception of conscious control is open to modification (or even manipulation). Wegner observes that one event is inferred to have caused a second event when two requirements are met:
# The first event immediately precedes the second event, and
# The first event is consistent with having caused the second event.
For example, if a person hears an explosion and sees a tree fall down that person is likely to infer that the explosion caused the tree to fall over. However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then that person is not likely to infer that either noise caused the tree to fall down.

Wegner has applied this principle to the inferences people make about their own conscious will. People typically experience a thought that is consistent with a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference.&lt;ref name="WegnerBook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480 | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D.M. | last2 = Wheatley | first2 = T. | year = 1999 | title = Apparent mental causation: sources of the experience of will | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 54 | issue = 7| pages = 480–91 | pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through such work, Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused&amp;nbsp;– and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Emily Pronin]] has argued that the subjective experience of free will is supported by the [[introspection illusion]]. This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people. The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pronin|first=Emily|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol. 41|editor=Mark P. Zanna|chapter=The Introspection Illusion |volume=41|publisher=Academic Press|pages=42–43|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-374472-2|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)00401-2|ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have shown that reducing a person's belief in free will makes them less helpful and more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = RF | last2 = Masicampo | first2 = EJ | last3 = Dewall | first3 = CN | year = 2009 | title = Prosocial benefits of feeling free: disbelief in free will increases aggression and reduces helpfulness | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 260–68 | doi = 10.1177/0146167208327217 | pmid = 19141628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur because the subject loses a sense of [[self-efficacy]].

Caveats have, however, been identified in studying a subject's awareness of mental events, in that the process of introspection itself may alter the experience.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book|title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |chapter=The neuroscience of movement |author=Susan Pockett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19 |page=19 |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572|quote=...it is important to be clear about exactly what experience one wants one's subjects to introspect. Of course, explaining to subjects exactly what the experimenter wants them to experience can bring its own problems–...instructions to attend to a particular internally generated experience can easily alter both the timing and the content of that experience and even whether or not it is consciously experienced at all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.B. Miles]] contradicts the idea that free will has prosocial benefits, recognizing that many distinguished minds have already brought up the negative effects that such a belief would ensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miles | first1 = J.B. | year = 2011 | title = 'Irresponsible and a Disservice': The integrity of social psychology turns on the free will dilemma | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 205–18 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02077.x | pmid = 22074173 | pmc = 3757306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation for the commonality of this mix-up is a lack of knowledge regarding the free will debate in psychological research. Miles analyzed the methods of popular studies and concluded that such research purported to be examining associations between behavior and disbelief in free will are actually examining the associations between behavior and belief in fatalism. While evidence of the negative effects of a belief in fatalism is legitimate, the research fails to study the effects of belief on free will which they claim to discuss. This occurrence is due to an incorrect understanding and implication that fatalism accompanies determinism. Fatalism is distinguished by the idea that decisions lack effect on the future because everything is determined. Conversely, determinism is the belief that everything operates under cause and effect; every action determines a reaction. Determinism, therefore emphasizes the importance and responsibility one has in decision making as every choice will have an accompanying effect. Seeing this flaw throughout commonly cited research, Miles presents countering research which includes “evidence that the myth of free choice encourages immoral, unjust, prejudiced, and anti-intellectual behaviour.” Miles suggests that while both extremes of fatalism and belief in free will result in negative social outcomes, determinism serves to encourage intentional, prosocial decision making. Ultimately, the point of this research is to encourage accurate knowledge of the free will debate when conducting and evaluating such studies in experimental psychology.

Regardless of the validity of, or benefit of, belief in free will, it may be beneficial to understand where the idea comes from. One contribution is randomness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebert | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Wegner | first2 = D.M. | year = 2011 | title = March 1). Mistaking randomness for free will | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 965–71 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2010.12.012 | pmid = 21367624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is established that randomness is not the only factor in the perception of the free will, it has been shown that randomness can be mistaken as free will due to its indeterminacy. This misconception applies both when considering oneself and others. Another contribution is choice.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, G., Baumeister, R.F., &amp; Wong, K.F. (2014, July 30). Free will is about choosing: The link between choice and the belief in free will. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 55, 239–45. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2014.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that people's belief in free will increases if presented with a simple level of choice. The specificity of the amount of choice is important, as too little or too great a degree of choice may negatively influence belief. It is also likely that the associative relationship between level of choice and perception of free will is influentially bidirectional. It is also possible that one's desire for control, or other basic motivational patterns, act as a third variable.

===Believing in free will{{anchor|Believing in free will}}===
In recent years, free will belief in individuals has been analysed with respect to traits in social behaviour. In general the concept of free will researched to date in this context has been that of the incompatibilist, or more specifically, the libertarian, that is freedom from determinism.

====What people believe====
Whether people naturally adhere to an incompatibilist model of free will has been questioned in the research. Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was not adhered to, in that determinism does not negate belief in moral responsibility (based on an empirical study of people's responses to moral dilemmas under a deterministic model of reality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=Stephen G Morris|author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer|author4=Jason Turner|date=2006-07-01|title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=73|issue=1|pages=28–53|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|issn=1933-1592|citeseerx=10.1.1.364.1083}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-04-29--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was naturally adhered to, in that determinism does indeed negate belief in moral responsibility in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

Studies indicate that peoples' belief in free will is inconsistent. Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler found that people believe they have more free will than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1012046108| pmid = 21149703| volume = 107| issue = 52| pages = 22469–74| last = Pronin| first = Emily|author2=Matthew B.

Studies also reveal a correlation between the likelihood of accepting a deterministic model of mind and personality type. For example, Adam Feltz and Edward Cokely found that people of an extrovert personality type are more likely to dissociate belief in determinism from belief in moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

[[Roy Baumeister]] and colleagues reviewed literature on the psychological effects of a belief (or disbelief) in free will. The first part of their analysis (which the only relevant part to this section) was not meant to discover the types of free will that actually exist. The researchers instead sought to identify what people believe, how many people believed it, and the effects of those beliefs. Baumeister found that most people tend to believe in a sort of "naive compatibilistic free will".&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. | last2 = Crescioni | first2 = A.W. | last3 = Alquist | first3 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Free will as advanced action control for human social life and culture | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume =4| issue = | pages =1–11| doi = 10.1007/s12152-010-9058-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulhus, D.L. and Margesson. A., (1994). ''Free Will and Determinism (FAD) scale''. Unpublished manuscript, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada: University of British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also found that people consider acts more "free" when they involve a person opposing external forces, planning, or making random actions.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, T.F., R.F. Baumeister, F.D. Fincham, T.E. Joiner, N.M. Lambert, A.R. Mele, and D.M. Tice. 2008. Guilty, free, and wise. Belief in free will promotes learning from negative emotions.

Randomness is too important to trust to chance. Presented at the 2007 Summer Institute in Informed Patient Choice, Dartmouth Medical School, NH&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wagenaar | first1 = W.

Taking into account all these personal variables existing in the debates over free will, Manuel Vargas has generally assumed that in fact “there is nearly always an unremarked upon elephant that lurks in rooms where philosophers discuss free will”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vargas|first=Manuel|date=2004|title=Libertarianism and Skepticism about Free Will|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=32|issue=1|pages=403–426|doi=10.5840/philtopics2004321/210|issn=0276-2080}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he particularly pointed to the role of (i)religion in motivating and sustaining various accounts of free will. As he put,&lt;blockquote&gt;My guess is that we would learn that a disproportionate number—perhaps even most—libertarians are religious and, especially, Christian. I suspect we would also learn that the overwhelming majority of compatibilists are atheist or agnostic. (I do not have a guess about the religious predilections of the various stripes of skeptical incompatibilists.) Even so, it may not be obvious why the religious beliefs of particular philosophers should matter. We could think that the arguments of the various partisans in free will debates should be judged on their merits, irrespective of whether or not they have religious motivation. However, systematically ignoring the role of religion can remove important considerations from view, considerations that affect how we think about, argue, and evaluate the various philosophical possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For example, by a detailed analysis of the writings and work of Arthur Eddington and Arthur Holy Compton in the English speaking world of the late 1920s and 1930s, one analysis clearly revealed not only a strong intrinsic religious motivation and specific conservative worldview concerns behind their own work on free will, but also similar personal, political and ideological factors, only of the opposite sign, in their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kožnjak|first=Boris|title=The Earliest Missionaries of 'Quantum Free Will': A Socio-Historical Analysis|volume=6|date=2018|work=Free Will &amp; Action|pages=131–154|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-99295-2_10|isbn=9783319992945|series=Historical-Analytical Studies on Nature, Mind and Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among philosophers====
A recent 2009 survey has shown that compatibilism is quite a popular stance among those who specialize in philosophy (59%). Belief in libertarianism amounted to 14%, while a lack of belief in free will equaled 12%. More than a half of surveyed people were US Americans.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bourget, D.J. Chalmers: ''What do philosophers believe?''. Philosophical Studies (3): 1–36 (2013). [http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP.pdf Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among evolutionary biologists====
79 percent of evolutionary biologists said that they believe in free-will according to a survey conducted in 2007, only 14 percent chose no free will, and 7 percent did not answer the question.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory W. Graffin and William B. Provine, “Evolution, Religion, and Free Will,” American Scientist 95 (July–August 2007), 294–97; results of Cornell Evolution Project survey,

====Effects of the belief itself====
{{see also|Self-efficacy}}

{{Quotebox|align=right|width=40%|quoted=1|quote= An alternative explanation builds on the idea that subjects tend to confuse determinism with fatalism... What happens then when agents’ self-efficacy is undermined? It is not that their basic desires and drives are defeated. It is rather, I suggest, that they become skeptical that they can control those desires; and in the face of that skepticism, they fail to apply the effort that is needed even to try. If they were tempted to behave badly, then coming to believe in fatalism makes them less likely to resist that temptation.|source=—Richard Holton&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;}}
Baumeister and colleagues found that provoking disbelief in free will seems to cause various negative effects. The authors concluded, in their paper, that it is belief in [[determinism]] that causes those negative effects.&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt; This may not be a very justified conclusion, however.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt; First of all, free will can at least refer to either [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian (indeterministic) free will]] or [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic (deterministic) free will]]. Having participants read articles that simply "disprove free will" is unlikely to increase their understanding of determinism, or the compatibilistic free will that it still permits.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

In other words, "provoking disbelief in free will" probably causes a belief in [[fatalism]]. As discussed earlier in this article, compatibilistic free will is illustrated by statements like ''"my choices have causes, and an effect&amp;nbsp;– so I affect my future"'', whereas fatalism is more like ''"my choices have causes, but no effect&amp;nbsp;– I am powerless"''. Fatalism, then, may be what threatens people's sense of [[self-efficacy]]. Lay people should not confuse fatalism with determinism, and yet even professional philosophers occasionally confuse the two. It is thus likely that the negative consequences below can be accounted for by participants developing a belief in ''fatalism'' when experiments attack belief in "free will".&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holton | first1 = Richard | year = 2011 | title = Response to 'Free Will as Advanced Action Control for Human Social Life and Culture' by Roy F.

Some studies have been conducted indicating that people react strongly to the way in which mental determinism is described, when reconciling it with moral responsibility. Eddy Nahmias has noted that when people's actions are framed with respect to their beliefs and desires (rather than their neurological underpinnings), they are more likely to dissociate determinism from moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=D.

Various social behavioural traits have been correlated with the belief in deterministic models of mind, some of which involved the experimental subjection of individuals to libertarian and deterministic perspectives.

After researchers provoked volunteers to disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more. Kathleen Vohs has found that those whose belief in free will had been eroded were more likely to cheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x| volume = 19| issue = 1| pages = 49–54| last = Vohs| first = Kathleen D.|author2=Jonathan W.

Baumeister and colleagues also note that volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of [[counterfactual thinking]].&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alquist, J.L., M. Daly, T.

==Eastern philosophy==

===Hindu philosophy===
{{see also|Free will in theology#Hinduism}}
The six orthodox ([[astik]]a) schools of thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] do not agree with each other entirely on the question of free will. For the [[Samkhya]], for instance, matter is without any freedom, and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter. The only real freedom (''kaivalya'') consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fapXqp-JSL0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=kaivalya|title=The ascetic self: subjectivity, memory and tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-60401-7|page=73|last=Flood|first=Gavin|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Yoga]] school, only [[Ishvara]] is truly free, and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings, thoughts, actions, or wills, and is thus not at all a freedom of will. The metaphysics of the [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism, but do not seem to make explicit claims about determinism or free will.&lt;ref name="koller"&gt;Koller, J. (2007) ''Asian Philosophies''. 5th ed. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-092385-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation from [[Swami Vivekananda]], a [[Vedanta|Vedantist]], offers a good example of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition.
{{quote|text=Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as free-will; the very words are a contradiction, because will is what we know, and everything that we know is within our universe, and everything within our universe is moulded by conditions of time, space and causality. ... To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it cannot be found here.&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;}}
However, the preceding quote has often been misinterpreted as Vivekananda implying that everything is predetermined. What Vivekananda actually meant by lack of free will was that the will was not "free" because it was heavily influenced by the law of cause and effect&amp;nbsp;– "The will is not free, it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect, but there is something behind the will which is free."&lt;ref name = "viveka"&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda]] (1907) {{cite web |url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_5/sayings_and_utterances.htm |title=Sayings and utterances |publisher=ramakrishnavivekananda.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivekananda never said things were absolutely determined and placed emphasis on the power of conscious choice to alter one's past [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]]: "It is the coward and the fool who says this is his [[Destiny|fate]]. But it is the strong man who stands up and says I will make my own fate."&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
[[Buddhism]] accepts both freedom and determinism (or something similar to it), but in spite of its focus towards the human agency, rejects the western concept of a total agent from external sources.&lt;ref name="Gier"&gt;Gier, Nicholas and Kjellberg, Paul. "Buddhism and the Freedom of the Will: Pali and Mahayanist Responses" in Freedom and Determinism. Campbell, Joseph Keim; O'Rourke, Michael; and Shier, David. 2004. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], "There is free action, there is retribution, but I see no agent that passes out from one set of momentary elements into another one, except the [connection] of those elements."&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt; Buddhists believe in neither absolute free will, nor determinism. It preaches a middle doctrine, named ''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], often translated as "inter-dependent arising". This theory is also called "Conditioned Genesis" or "[[Dependent Origination]]". It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance. In part, it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not "free" to begin with. It is also part of the theory of [[karma in Buddhism]]. The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's [[destiny]] in future lives.

In Buddhism it is taught that the idea of absolute freedom of choice (that is that any human being could be completely free to make any choice) is unwise, because it denies the reality of one's physical needs and circumstances. Equally incorrect is the idea that humans have no choice in life or that their lives are pre-determined. To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress (through our capacity to freely choose compassionate action). ''Pubbekatahetuvada'', the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions, is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines. Because Buddhists also reject [[agency (philosophy)|agenthood]], the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well. Instead, the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality. Ancient India had many heated arguments about the nature of causality with [[Jain]]s, [[Nyaya|Nyayists]], [[Samkhya|Samkhyists]], [[Cārvāka]]ns, and Buddhists all taking slightly different lines. In many ways, the Buddhist position is closer to a theory of "conditionality" than a theory of "causality", especially as it is expounded by [[Nagarjuna]] in the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]''.&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Free will in theology}}

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Antonio Rodríguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustine's view of free will and predestination would go on to have a profound impact on Christian theology]]

The notions of free will and predestination are heavily debated among Christians. Free will in the Christian sense is the ability to choose between good or evil. Among Catholics, there are those holding to [[Thomism]], adopted from what [[Thomas Aquinas]] put forth in the ''[[Summa Theologica]].'' There are also some holding to [[Molinism]] which was put forth by Jesuit priest [[Luis de Molina]]. Among Protestants there is [[Arminianism]], held primarily by [[Methodist]] and some [[Baptist]], and formulated by Dutch theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]; and there is also [[Calvinism]] held by most in the [[Reformed]] tradition which was formulated by the French Reformed theologian, [[John Calvin]]. John Calvin was heavily influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo]] views on predestination put forth in his work ''On the Predestination of the Saints.'' [[Martin Luther]] seems to hold views on predestination similar to Calvinism in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]],'' thus rejecting free will. In condemnation of Calvin and Luther views, the Council of Trent declared that "the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v)."

[[Paul the Apostle]] discusses Predestination in some of his Epistles.

"''For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren; and whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.''” —[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8:29–30

“''He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will.''” —[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 1:5

The exact meaning of these verses has been debated by Christian theologians throughout history.

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas relief]] of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]
[[Maimonides]] reasoned that human beings have free will (at least in the context of choosing to do good or evil).  Without free will, the demands of [[Nevi'im#Latter Prophets|the prophets]] would have been meaningless, there would be no need for the [[Torah]], and justice could not be administered.  In Maimonides's view, human free will is granted by God as part of the universe's design.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam Teshuvah 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===

In [[Islam]] the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's ''jabr'', or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an "acquisition" or "dual-agency" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]]. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948; [[Harry Austryn Wolfson|Wolfson, Harry]]. The Philosophy of Kalam, Harvard University Press 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia]] Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward [[predestination]] is challenged by most theologians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mananddestiny/3.htm |title=Man and His Destiny |publisher=Al-islam.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. Actions taken by people exercising free will are counted on the [[Day of Judgement]] because they are their own; however, the free will happens with the permission of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tosun|first=Ender|title=Guide to Understanding Islam|year=2012|location=Istanbul|isbn=978-605-631-981-5|url=http://www.islamicinformationcenter.info/understandingislam.pdf|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Timothy P. (1998) "Arminian edification: Kierkegaard on grace and free will" in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because "the greatest good ... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. (1848) ''Journals and Papers'', vol. III. Reprinted in Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1967–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s "[[Plantinga's free will defense|free will defense]]" is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and [[problem of evil|evil]] are consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, J.L. (1955) "Evil and Omnipotence", ''Mind'', new series, vol. 64, pp. 200–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers follow [[William of Ockham]] in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.&lt;ref name="ockham"&gt;Ockham, William. Predestination, God's Knowledge, and Future Contingents, early 14th century, trans. Marilyn McCord Adams and [[Norman Kretzmann]] 1982, Hackett, esp pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers follow [[Philo of Alexandria]], a philosopher known for his [[homocentrism]], in holding that free will is a feature of a human's [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and thus that non-human [[animal]]s lack free will.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. Wolfson]], ''Philo'', 1947 Harvard University Press; Religious Philosophy, 1961 Harvard University Press; and "St. Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy" in Religious Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the 10th and final manned Gemini flight, the 18th manned American spaceflight, and the 26th spaceflight of all time, including [[X-15]] flights over {{convert|100|km|nmi|sp=us}}. Commanded by [[Gemini 7|Gemini VII]] veteran [[Jim Lovell|James A. Lovell]], the flight featured three periods of [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA) by rookie [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin]], lasting a total of 5 hours and 30 minutes. It also achieved the fifth [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] and fourth [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|docking]] with an [[Agena target vehicle]].

Gemini XII marked a successful conclusion of the Gemini program, achieving the last of its goals by successfully demonstrating that astronauts can effectively work outside of spacecraft. This was instrumental in paving the way for the [[Apollo program]] to achieve its goal of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.

==Launch==
Liftoff of the Atlas/Agena Target Vehicle occurred at 2:07:59 PM EST, and of the Gemini/Titan spacecraft at 3:46:33 PM EST, on November 11.&lt;ref name="mission"/&gt; All launch vehicle systems performed nominally during powered flight, but at staging there was a recurrence of the first stage oxidizer tank rupture first seen on [[Gemini 10]]'s launch. On Gemini 12, the fuel tank appeared to have also ruptured as a white cloud was seen emitting from the spent stage along with the orange [[nitrogen tetroxide]]. Another episode of "Green Man" also occurred at SECO, referring to pitch gyrations caused by pressure buildup in the second stage protective skirt.

==Objectives==
[[File:S66-63387 PR.jpg|right|thumb|The Gemini 12 spacecraft and the Agena, photographed at 15 feet apart during docking]]
[[File:Gemini 12 tethered stationkeeping.jpg|righ|thumb|Gemini 12 tethered stationkeeping]]
At the completion of the previous Gemini flight, the program still had not demonstrated that an astronaut could work easily and efficiently outside the spacecraft. In preparation for Gemini XII new, improved restraints were added to the outside of the capsule, and a new technique—underwater training—was introduced, which would become a staple of future space-walk simulation. Aldrin's two-hour, 20-minute tethered space-walk, during which he photographed star fields, retrieved a micrometeorite collector and did other chores, at last demonstrated the feasibility of extravehicular activity. Two more stand-up EVAs also went smoothly, as did the by-now routine rendezvous and docking with an Agena which was done "manually" using the onboard computer and charts when a rendezvous radar failed. The climb to a higher orbit, however, was canceled because of a problem with the [[Agena target vehicle|Agena]] booster.

During orbital injection, the GATV engine experienced a drop in turbopump speed lasting about 2.5 seconds. After this, pump performance returned to normal. Telemetry data indicated erratic pump speeds, but engine performance did not reflect this. Ground controllers decided not to risk the planned orbital boost maneuver since the exact reason for the pump slowdown was unclear. Following Gemini 12's reentry and during the GATV's 63rd orbit, they attempted to fire the propulsion system, but a stuck fuel valve prevented engine start from occurring.

It was suspected that a turbopump bearing failure caused the anomalous conditions during orbital injection, followed by heating and melting of pump components. The inability of ground controllers to start the engine during the 63rd orbit was possibly due to melted or loose debris blocking the fuel valve and preventing its operation. The telemetry data falsely reporting erratic pump speed was concluded to be debris being knocked around and affecting the data probes.

Many documentaries{{examples|date=May 2011}} afterward largely credit the [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalk]] innovations, including the [[Neutral buoyancy simulation as a training aid|underwater training]], to Aldrin himself.&lt;ref&gt;"Friends and Rivals," When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions, Season 1 Ep. 2, Discovery Channel (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Gemini 12 was designed to perform rendezvous and docking with the Agena target vehicle, to conduct three [[Extra-vehicular activity|extra-vehicular activity (EVA)]] operations, to conduct a tethered stationkeeping exercise, to perform docked maneuvers using the Agena propulsion system to change orbit, and demonstrate an automatic reentry.

When Gemini 12 was being planned, one of the possibilities raised was the potential for the flight to be run in conjunction with the [[Apollo 1|first Apollo mission]], which had been tentatively scheduled for the last quarter of 1966. By May 1966, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Apollo Shot May Come This Year |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WjNbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jU8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=apollo&amp;pg=1914%2C190638 |agency=[[United Press International]] |newspaper=The Bonham Daily Favorite |location=Bonham, TX |date=May 5, 1966 |page=1 |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became moot when slippage in readiness of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo spacecraft]] caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the Apollo mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.&lt;ref name="SP4029"&gt;{{cite book |last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |title=Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/SP-4029.htm |accessdate=July 12, 2013 |series=NASA History Series |origyear=First published 2000 |date=September 2004 |work=NASA History Division, Office of Policy and Plans |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-16-050631-X |lccn=00061677 |id=NASA SP-2000-4029 |chapter=Apollo 1 - The Fire: 27 January 1967 |chapterurl=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_01a_Summary.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experiments===
[[File:Lovell and Aldrin on Deck - GPN-2000-001356.jpg|thumb|Gemini 12 crew after splashdown]]
The 14 scientific experiments were (1) frog egg growth under zero-g, (2) synoptic terrain photography, (3) synoptic weather photography, (4) nuclear emulsions, (5) airglow horizon photography, (6) UV astronomical photography, and (7) dim sky photography. Two micrometeorite collection experiments, as well as three space phenomena photography experiments, were not fully completed.

===Reentry===
The capsule was controlled on reentry by computer and splashed down 4.8 kilometers from its target. The crew were taken aboard the aircraft carrier {{USS|Wasp|CV-18|6}}.

The Gemini 12 mission was supported by the following U.S. Department of Defense resources; 9,775 personnel, 65 aircraft and 12 ships.

Postflight medical examination disclosed no unusual conditions in either astronaut. Both were slightly exhausted and dehydrated due to problems with the spacecraft's water supply system forcing them to reduce their fluid intake on the last day of the mission and Lovell had a mild case of [[pinkeye]].

==Insignia==
[[File:Gemini 12 Flown Fliteline Gold-Plated Sterling Silver Medallion.jpg|thumb|left|Gemini 12 space-flown [[NASA space-flown Robbins medallions of the Apollo missions#Gemini mission space-flown Fliteline medallions|Fliteline Medallion]]]]
The patch's unique orange and black colors are a link to the flight's original scheduled date close to Halloween. The Roman numeral XII is located at the 12 o'clock position on the face of a clock, with the Gemini spacecraft pointing to it like the hour hand of a clock. This represents the position of Gemini 12 as the last flight of the Gemini program. With the Apollo project following this last flight of the Gemini program, the ultimate objective—the Moon—is symbolized by the crescent on the left.

==Spacecraft location==
After several years at the [[Museum of Transport and Technology]], in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], the spacecraft was returned to the United States. It is now on display at the [[Adler Planetarium]], [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Lovell and Aldrin were reunited with the spacecraft November 9, 2006 during the opening for Adler's "Shoot for the Moon" exhibit, almost 40 years after the mission launched.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7095">'''Gerontechnology''' is an inter- and multidisciplinary academic and professional field combining [[gerontology]] and [[technology]]. Sustainability of an ageing society depends upon our effectiveness in creating technological environments, including [[assistive technology]] and [[inclusive design]], for innovative and independent living and social participation of older adults in any state of health, comfort and safety. In short, gerontechnology concerns matching technological environments to [[health]], [[House|housing]], mobility, [[communication]], [[leisure]] and work of older people. Research outcomes form the basis for [[designers]], [[Construction worker|builders]], [[engineers]], [[manufacturers]], and those in the health professions ([[nursing]], [[medicine]], [[gerontology]], [[geriatrics]], [[environmental psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], etc.), to provide an optimum living environment for the widest range of  ages.

==Description==
Gerontechnology, which has also been called '''''gerotechnology''''' is considered an adjunct to the promotion of human [[health]] and [[well-being]]. It pertains to both human development and aging with the aim to compress [[morbidity]] and to increase [[vitality]] and [[quality of life]] throughout the [[life-span]]. It creates solutions to extend the working phase in society by maximizing the vital and productive years in the later years of life, which consequently reduces the [[cost of care]].

The overall framework of gerontechnology may be seen as a matrix of '''domains of human activity''': (1) health &amp; self-esteem, housing &amp; [[activities of daily living]], communication &amp; governance, mobility &amp; transport, work &amp; leisure, and (2) '''technology interventions''' or impact levels (enhancement &amp; satisfaction, prevention &amp; engagement, compensation &amp; assistance, care and care organisation). Underpinning all these elements are generic and applied [[evidence-based]] research. Such research supports the development of products and services.

Gerontechnology has much in common with other interdisciplinary domains, such as [[Assistive Technology]] (for the compensation &amp; assistance and the care support &amp; care organisation rows of the matrix), and [[Universal Design]] for the development of all products and services pertaining to gerontechnology.

==Gerontological design==
Gerontological design focuses on providing effective solutions to improve the way of life for aging people, through gerontological knowledge and [[design research]] methods to obtain a better understanding of individuals' preferences and requirements.

Gerontological design also refers specifically to the study and practice of building design methods that support elderly users in the built environment.  Some universities host professors, commonly in architecture or interior design departments, that specialize in the study and teaching of this design specialization.  Not only does this include the examination of building design characteristics that impact older adults' physiological well-being, but it can also include the investigation of building design characteristics that impact informational needs (i.e. finding one's way around in a space) or social interaction needs (Campbell, 2012).

Between 2008 and 2030, [[Singapore]] will witness an age profile shift in its population's history. In 2005, one in 12 residents was 65 years or older. By 2030, one in five residents will be 65 years or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministry of Community Development, Committee on Ageing Issues |year=2006 |title=Report on the Ageing population. Demographic Realities: Opportunities and Challenges |accessdate=July 31, 2008 |url=http://www.mcys.gov.sg/successful_ageing/report/CAI_report.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028115440/http://www.mcys.gov.sg/successful_ageing/report/CAI_report.pdf |archivedate=October 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies show that in 2002, 7% of the world's population is aged 65 and above. By 2050, it is envisaged that the percentage could rise to nearly 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Census Bureau|date=March 2004|title=Global population at a glance: 2002 and beyond. International Brief (Report No. WP/02-1)|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=July 31, 2008|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/wp02-1.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Population ageing|aging population]] and its impact on [[economics]], [[politics]], [[education]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] is no longer an isolated issue but a global concern. Products and services relevant to the "silver industry" or the "mature market" increasingly abound in the marketplace. The demand for designers with a keen sense for the aging population's needs who employ gerontological design process knowledge concomitantly rises.

== Publications ==
An international academic journal with delayed open-access, '''''Gerontechnology''''' [http://www.gerontechjournal.net], is published by the '''International Society for Gerontechnology (ISG)''' [http://www.gerontechnology.org].

A comprehensive edited book "'''''Gerontechnology'''''" [http://www.springerpub.com/gerontechnology-9780826128881.html]has been published in 2016.

== Education ==
[[Image:SetupResearch.jpg|thumb]] The first ISG Masterclass [http://www.phe.bwk.tue.nl/ISGMasterClass/Main_mclass.htm] for PhD students in 2006 produced a scheme to support gerontechnological research.

'''''Ghost Stations''''' is a series of books by the British [[military historian]] [[Bruce Barrymore Halpenny]], containing ostensibly true ghost and [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] stories generally connected to the [[RAF]], [[airfields]] and other military or war connected stories.

== History ==

Bruce Halpenny had been writing ghost stories in the 1960s and encountering ghost stories in his exhaustive research into airfield histories, when he decided they should form the subject of a special book, and so started to add to and research his “ghost-mystery” files about abandoned airfields that "murmur and whisper with ghosts".&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts of the old airfields'' – [[Daily Mirror]] – Thursday, 16 August 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Peter Tory's Diary'' – [[Daily Mirror]] – Monday, 20 August 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Halpenny had by 1984 become acknowledged as a respected British military historian, expert in airfield histories, and expert in "RAF ghosts", especially surrounding airfields.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts of War'' – by Ken Livemore – ''[[Titbits]]'' – Summer Special 1984, pages 42 – 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The author has since the 1960s been presenting evidence of paranormal activity on airfields, as well as campaigning for not just the Government to do their part and preserve a [[World War II|1939–45 War]] airfield, in its original condition to let future generations see, but also for the history of each to be recorded fully and the men and sacrifice never forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;''Bruce sends airfield mayday'' – [[The Northern Echo]] – Friday, 5 March 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ghost Stations'' was officially launched at [[RAF Wittering]] on Thursday 16 October 1986.&lt;ref name=LM-13-10-1986 &gt;''Flight into ghostly unknown'' – Mr. Leicester's Page – [[Leicester Mercury]] – Monday, 13 October 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The book took 18 months to compile&lt;ref name= "LM-13-10-1986"/&gt; and drew upon the author's knowledge and experience working in airfields and documenting their history.&lt;ref name= "LM-13-10-1986"/&gt; ''Ghost Stations'' proved a best seller&lt;ref&gt;''Books'' – ''Ghostly deeds'' – Steve Anderson – [[Hull Daily Mail]] – Friday, 14 November 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by a second book, entitled, ''Aaargh!'' that was published with over 30 "ghostly and mysterious" tales, one of which was "The eerie mystery of Lightning 894". ''Aaargh!'', was later to become ''Ghost Stations 2'' as six more books followed over the years.&lt;ref&gt;''The eerie mystery of Lightning 894'' – [[Grimsby Telegraph|Grimsby Evening Telegraph]] – Friday, 9 September 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

''GHOST STATIONS'' became a trademark in the late 1980s and in 2008 the new Ghost Stations series, based on the original series, was brought out. In the new series the stories had been shuffled around and merged, thus a story that was being investigated by Bruce Halpenny that was in several books in the old series, were merged into one story in one book in the new series. Also regional books were created in the new series, with ''Ghost Stations Lincolnshire'', already for some Lincolnshire bookshops, one of their best sellers.&lt;ref&gt;''Give the gift of reading at Christmas'' – Finding Your Presents in Print – [[Lincolnshire Echo]] – Tuesday, 18 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The author's son, [[Graphic Designer|commercial artist]], [[book editor]] and writer, [[Baron Barrymore Halpenny]] had a hand in the book cover design from the original series to the new series.

The author expresses his beliefs in the supernatural:

{{quote|It is difficult for people to believe in ghosts and this is understandable for people tend to accept only what they can see and hear with their normal senses. Strange paranormal events take place, which seem to verge on fantasy, these events happen when we least expect them. It is not necessarily the bewitching hour of midnight, which animates ghosts; neither is it necessary for the location to be the hallowed ground of some ancient churchyard, or burial place. Ghosts and other phantoms can show up at any time, day or night, taking many forms.|[[Bruce Barrymore Halpenny]]&lt;ref name="Brawdcast18-1988"&gt;''Brawdcast'' – The Magazine of [[RAF Brawdy]] and USNAVFAC – ISSUE NO 18, November, 1988 – pages19,20,21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== A ==

*'''[[Abductive logic programming]]''' – Abductive logic programming (ALP) is a high-level knowledge-representation framework that can be used to solve problems declaratively based on abductive reasoning. It extends normal logic programming by allowing some predicates to be incompletely defined, declared as abducible predicates. 
*'''[[Abductive reasoning]]''' – '''Abductive reasoning''' (also called '''abduction''',&lt;ref name="Josephson"&gt;For example: {{cite book |editor1-last=Josephson |editor1-first=John R. |editor2-last=Josephson |editor2-first=Susan G. |date=1994 |title=Abductive Inference: Computation, Philosophy, Technology |location=Cambridge, UK; New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521434610 |oclc=28149683 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511530128}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''abductive inference''',&lt;ref name="Josephson"/&gt; or '''retroduction'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/retroduction|title = &lt;nowiki&gt;Retroduction | Dictionary | Commens&lt;/nowiki&gt;|date = |accessdate = 2014-08-24|website = Commens – Digital Companion to C. S. Peirce|publisher = Mats Bergman, Sami Paavola &amp; João Queiroz}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a form of [[logical inference]] which starts with an observation or set of observations then seeks to find the simplest and most likely explanation. This process, unlike [[deductive reasoning]], yields a plausible conclusion but does not [[logical positivism|positively verify]] it. 
*'''[[Abstract data type]]''' – is a [[mathematical model]] for [[data type]]s, where a data type is defined by its behavior ([[Semantics (computer science)|semantics]]) from the point of view of a ''user'' of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.
*'''[[Abstraction (software engineering)|Abstraction]]''' – is the process of removing physical, spatial, or temporal details&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colburn|first=Timothy|last2=Shute|first2=Gary|date=2007-06-05|title=Abstraction in Computer Science|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11023-007-9061-7|journal=Minds and Machines|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=169–184|doi=10.1007/s11023-007-9061-7|issn=0924-6495}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] in the study of objects or [[System|systems]] in order to more closely attend to other details of interest&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kramer|first=Jeff|date=2007-04-01|title=Is abstraction the key to computing?|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1232743.1232745|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=50|issue=4|pages=36–42|doi=10.1145/1232743.1232745|issn=0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Accelerating change]]''' – is a perceived increase in the rate of [[technological change]] throughout history, which may suggest faster and more profound change in the future and may or may not be accompanied by equally profound social and cultural change.
*'''[[Action language]]''' – is a language for specifying [[state transition system]]s, and is commonly used to create [[formal model]]s of the effects of actions on the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gelfond, Vladimir Lifschitz (1998) "[http://www.ep.liu.se/ea/cis/1998/016/ Action Languages]", ''Linköping Electronic Articles in Computer and Information Science'', vol '''3''', nr ''16''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Action languages are commonly used in the [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]] domains, where they describe how actions affect the states of systems over time, and may be used for [[automated planning]].
*'''[[Action model learning]]''' – is an area of machine learning concerned with creation and modification of software agent's knowledge about effects and preconditions of the actions that can be executed within its environment. This knowledge is usually represented in logic-based action description language and used as the input for automated planners.
*'''[[Action selection]]''' – is a way of characterizing the most basic problem of intelligent systems: what to do next. In artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science, "the action selection problem" is typically associated with intelligent agents and animats—artificial systems that exhibit complex behaviour in an agent environment.
*'''[[Activation function]]''' – In [[artificial neural network]]s, the '''activation function''' of a node defines the output of that node, or "neuron," given an input or set of inputs. This output is then used as input for the next node and so on until a desired solution to the original problem is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/activation-function|title=What is an Activation Function?|last=|first=|date=|website=deepai.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''[[Adaptive algorithm]]''' – an algorithm that changes its behavior at the time it is run, based on ''a priori'' defined reward mechanism or criterion.
*'''[[Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system]]''' –
*'''[[Admissible heuristic]]''' – In [[computer science]], specifically in [[algorithm]]s related to [[pathfinding]], a [[heuristic function]] is said to be '''admissible''' if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal, i.e. the cost it estimates to reach the goal is not higher than the lowest possible cost from the current point in the path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

*'''[[AI-complete]]''' – In the field of artificial intelligence, the most difficult problems are informally known as '''AI-complete''' or '''AI-hard''', implying that the difficulty of these computational problems is equivalent to that of solving the central artificial intelligence problem—making computers as intelligent as people, or [[artificial general intelligence|strong AI]].&lt;ref name="Shapiro92"&gt;Shapiro, Stuart C. (1992). [http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Papers/ai.pdf Artificial Intelligence] In Stuart C. Shapiro (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence'' (Second Edition, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–57). New York: John Wiley. (Section 4 is on "AI-Complete Tasks".)&lt;/ref&gt;  To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it would not be solved by a simple specific algorithm. 
*'''[[Algorithm]]''' – is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems.  Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks.
*'''[[Algorithmic efficiency]]''' – is a property of an [[algorithm]] which relates to the number of [[computational resource]]s used by the algorithm. An algorithm must be [[analysis of algorithms|analyzed]] to determine its resource usage, and the efficiency of an algorithm can be measured based on usage of different resources. Algorithmic efficiency can be thought of as analogous to engineering [[productivity]] for a repeating or continuous process.
*'''[[Algorithmic probability]]''' – In [[algorithmic information theory]], '''algorithmic probability''', also known as '''Solomonoff probability''', is a mathematical method of assigning a prior [[probability]] to a given observation.

The weights of output neurons can be learned so that the network can (re)produce specific temporal patterns. The main interest of this network is that although its behaviour is non-linear, the only weights that are modified during training are for the synapses that connect the hidden neurons to output neurons. Thus, the error function is quadratic with respect to the parameter vector and can be differentiated easily to a linear system.

The '''Gulf snapping turtle''' or '''Lavaracks' turtle''' (''Elseya lavarackorum'') is a large [[species]] of freshwater [[turtle]] in the sidenecked family [[Chelidae]].&lt;ref name="gt10"&gt;Georges, A., &amp; Thomson, S. 2010. [http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2010/f/zt02496p037.pdf Diversity of Australasian freshwater turtles, with an annotated synonymy and keys to species.] Zootaxa 2496: 1–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The species is specific to northern [[Australia]] in northwest [[Queensland]] and northeast [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=TW&amp;G97 /&gt; The species, similar to other members of the Australian snapping turtles in genus ''Elseya,'' only comes ashore to lay eggs and bask.&lt;ref name=cann97&gt;Cann, J 1998, Australian freshwater turtles, Beaumont, Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gulf snapping turtle is a [[herbivore]] and primarily consumes ''[[pandanus]]'' and figs.&lt;ref name=TSNT/&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]], ''lavarackorum'' (genitive plural), is in honor of Australian [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] Jim Lavarack and Sue Lavarack who discovered the fossil remains of this species.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael. 2011. ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. (''Elseya lavarackorum'', p. 152).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described in 1994 as ''Emydura lavarackorum'' after [[fossil]] material was found in [[Australian Fossil Mammal Sites (Riversleigh)|Riversleigh]] in northwest Queensland.&lt;ref name=W&amp;A94/&gt; It was later demonstrated anatomically that because of its anterior bridge struts that it actually belonged to the genus ''[[Elseya]]'' and further to a living, although undescribed form.&lt;ref name=TW&amp;G97 /&gt; The species was also declared at this time to be Australia's first [[living fossil]] freshwater turtle and an extant population of a [[Pleistocene]] [[taxon]].&lt;ref name=TW&amp;G97&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Thomson, S.A. |author2= White, A. |author3= Georges, A. |date= 1997-06-30 |title= Re-evaluation of ''Emydura lavarackorum'': identification of a living fossil |journal= Memoirs of the Queensland Museum |volume= 42 |issue=  |pages= 327–336 |url= http://aerg.canberra.edu.au/reprints/1997_Thomson_White_Georges_Elseya_lavarackorum.pdf |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080723133541/http://aerg.canberra.edu.au/reprints/1997_Thomson_White_Georges_Elseya_lavarackorum.pdf |archivedate= 23 July 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter gained significant public attention to this species after a story was published in Discover Magazine in January 1997.&lt;ref name=zimm97&gt;Zimmer, C. 1997. [http://discovermagazine.com/1997/jan/shellgame971#.UZkJOqLVCXQ Shell Game] Discover Magazine 1997(1)&lt;/ref&gt; After placing this species in the correct genus, it was possible to look at the deeper phylogeny of the ''Elseya.'' This species lends its name to the group within the ''Elseya'' known as the Queensland ''Elseya'' or ''Elseya lavarackorum'' group.&lt;ref name=TGL06&gt;Thomson, S., Georges, A. and C. Limpus (2006). A New Species of Freshwater Turtle in the Genus ''Elseya'' (Testudines: Chelidae) from Central Coastal Queensland, Australia. ''[[Chelonian Conservation and Biology|Chelon. Conserv.

==Description==
The turtle is a large, brown to dark brown, short-necked turtle. Its [[carapace]], or upper shell, reaches {{convert|35|cm|in|0}} in length; it has an undulating [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]] between the hemeral and pectoral shields in the white [[plastron]], or under shell.&lt;ref name=DEW&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species/pubs/67197-conservation-advice.pdf |title= Approved Conservation Advice for ''Elseya lavarackorum'' (Gulf snapping turtle) |accessdate= 8 January 2010 |work= |publisher= Department of the Environment and Water Resources, Australia |date= 3 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The undulating (rather than straight) suture in the plastron distinguishes it from the northern snapping turtle (''[[Elseya dentata]]'').&lt;ref name=TSNT&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/wildlife/animals/threatened/pdf/herps/gulf_snapping_turtle_lc.pdf |title= Threatened Species of the Northern Territory: Gulf Snapping Turtle |accessdate= 8 January 2010 |work= John Woinarski (compiler) |publisher= Department of Natural Resources, Environment and the Arts, Northern Territory |date= May 2006 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091009045139/http://nt.gov.au/nreta/wildlife/animals/threatened/pdf/herps/gulf_snapping_turtle_lc.pdf |archivedate= 9 October 2009 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
The turtle is restricted to rivers draining into the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] in the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Queensland]]. These rivers range from the [[Nicholson River (Western Australia)|Nicholson]] to [[Calvert River]] systems in the Northern Territory to the Gregory River in Queensland.&lt;ref name=TSNT/&gt;&lt;ref name=DEW/&gt;

==Behaviour==
The turtles are primarily [[herbivory|herbivorous]] and eat fruits, flowers, leaves, bark and ''[[Pandanus]]'' roots, and the juveniles also eat [[insect]] larvae. [[Ficus|Fig]]s are also an important food for the turtles. Despite their usually herbivorous diet, these turtles are readily trapped using meat as bait. Their eggs are laid in soil near the edge of the water.&lt;ref name=TSNT/&gt;

==Status and conservation==
The turtle is listed as [[Endangered]] under the Commonwealth ''Endangered Species Protection Act 1992'',&lt;ref name="EPBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=67197 |title=''Elseya lavarackorum'' — Gulf Snapping Turtle |work=Species Profile and Threats Database |publisher=[[Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts]] |date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] under Queensland's ''Nature Conservation Act 1992'', and as of [[Least Concern]] under the Northern Territory's ''Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2000''.&lt;ref name=DEW/&gt;

The main threats to the turtle include disturbance to [[nest]]ing sites by [[feral]] animals such as [[pig]]s, [[habitat destruction]] by grazing and watering [[cattle]], and potentially through changes to [[hydrology]], disturbance, and [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=DEW/&gt; In addition to these main threats, they've been shown to sometimes get caught in fishing nets.&lt;ref name=TSNT/&gt;

The science of the microscopic structures of the tissues formed within histogenesis is termed [[histology]].

==Germ layers==
[[File:Gastrulation.png|thumb|300px|'''[[Gastrulation]] of a [[diploblasty|diploblast]]:''' The formation of germ layers from a (1) [[blastula]] to a (2) [[gastrula]]. Some of the ectoderm cells (orange) move inward forming the endoderm (red).]]
{{main|Germ layer}}
A '''germ layer''' is a collection of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, formed during animal and mammalian [[embryogenesis]]. Germ layers are typically pronounced within [[vertebrate]] organisms; however, [[animal]]s or mammals more complex than [[sea sponge|sponge]]s ([[eumetazoa]]ns and [[wikispecies:agnotozoa|agnotozoans]]) produce two or three primary tissue layers. Animals with [[symmetry (biology)#Radial symmetry|radial symmetry]], such as [[cnidaria]]ns, produce two layers, called the [[ectoderm]] and [[endoderm]]. Therefore, they are [[diploblastic]]. Animals with [[symmetry (biology)#Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry]] produce a third layer in-between called [[mesoderm]], making them [[triploblastic]]. Germ layers will eventually give rise to all of an animal’s or mammal's [[biological tissue|tissues]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s through a process called [[organogenesis]].

===Endoderm===
{{main|Endoderm}}
The '''endoderm''' is one of the germ to penes 
layers formed during animal embryogenesis. Cells migrating inward along the [[archenteron]] form the inner layer of the [[gastrula]], which develops into the [[endoderm]]. Initially, the endoderm consists of flattened cells, which subsequently become columnar.

===Mesoderm===
{{main|Mesoderm}}
The '''mesoderm''' germ layer forms in the [[embryo]]s of [[animal]]s and [[mammal]]s more complex than [[cnidaria]]ns, making them [[triploblastic]]. During [[gastrulation]], some of the cells migrating inward to form the [[endoderm]] form an additional layer between the endoderm and the [[ectoderm]]. A theory suggests that this key innovation evolved hundreds of millions of years ago and led to the evolution of nearly all large, complex animals. The formation of a mesoderm led to the formation of a [[body cavity|coelom]]. Organs formed inside a coelom can freely move, grow, and develop independently of the body wall while fluid cushions and protects them from shocks.

===Ectoderm===
{{main|Ectoderm}}
The '''ectoderm''' is the start of a tissue that covers the body surfaces. It emerges first and forms from the outermost of the [[germ layer]]s.

'''John Leslie Coogan''' (October 26, 1914 – March 1, 1984) was an American actor and comedian who began his movie career as a [[child actor]] in [[silent film]]s.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/02/obituaries/jackie-coogan-child-star-of-films-dies-at-69.html| title=Jackie Coogan, Child Star of Films, dies at 69| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=2 March 1984| accessdate=2013-05-15| last=Barron| first=James| publisher=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlie Chaplin]]'s film classic ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'' (1921) made him one of the first child stars in film history. He later sued his mother and stepfather over his squandered film earnings and provoked [[California]] to enact the first known legal protection for the earnings of child performers, widely known as the [[California Child Actor's Bill|Coogan Act]].&lt;ref name=dnbgkyobitap&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9O4aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TEcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6730%2C526838 |newspaper=Daily News |location=Bowling Green, Kentucky |agency=Associated Press |title=Former child star Jackie Coogan dies |date=March 4, 1984 |page=17B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coogan continued to act throughout his life, later earning renewed fame in middle age portraying [[Uncle Fester]] in the 1960s TV series ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]''.

==Early life and early career==
He was born as John Leslie Coogan in 1914 in [[Los Angeles]], California, to John Henry Coogan Jr. and Lillian Rita (Dolliver) Coogan.&lt;!-- (not John Leslie Coogan Jr., as some sources indicate) His birth name is based on Coogan family genealogy sites. There is no record of any John Leslie Coogan Sr. --&gt;&lt;ref name=group /&gt;&lt;ref name="group1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cooganresearchgroup.com/crg/index.htm| title=Coogan Research Group| date=30 April 2013| accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began performing as an infant in both [[vaudeville]] and film, with an uncredited role in the 1917 film ''[[Skinner's Baby]]''. [[Charlie Chaplin]] discovered him in the [[Orpheum Theatre (Los Angeles)|Orpheum Theatre]], a vaudeville house in Los Angeles, on the stage doing the [[shimmy]], a dance popular at the time. Coogan's father was also an actor, as was his younger brother, [[Robert Coogan]]. Jackie Coogan was a natural mimic and delighted Chaplin with his abilities. Chaplin cast him in a small role in ''[[A Day's Pleasure]]'' (1919). He was Chaplin's irascible companion in ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'' (1921) and the following year played the title role in ''[[Oliver Twist (1922 film)|Oliver Twist]]'', directed by [[Frank Lloyd]]. Coogan was one of the first stars to be heavily merchandised. Peanut butter, stationery, whistles, dolls, records, and figurines were among the Coogan-themed merchandise on sale.

[[File:Jackiecoogan.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Coogan in 1920]]
Coogan was tutored until the age of 10, when he entered [[Urban Military Academy]] and other prep schools. He attended several colleges, as well as the [[University of Southern California]]. In 1932, he dropped out of [[Santa Clara University]] because of poor grades.

In November 1933, 22-year-old [[Brooke Hart]], a close friend of Coogan from Santa Clara University and heir to a successful department store in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], was kidnapped as he drove his car out of a parking lot. After several demands for a $40,000 ransom were delivered to the family, police arrested Thomas Thurmond and John Holmes in San Jose. Thurmond admitted that he and Holmes had murdered Hart the same day he was kidnapped. Both killers were transferred to a jail in [[Downtown San Jose|downtown]] San Jose.  A mob broke into the jail, and Thurmond and Holmes were [[Lynching in the United States|hanged]] from a tree in a nearby park, with the unapologetic approval of the state's governor. Coogan was reported to be present and to have held the lynching rope.&lt;ref name="farrell"&gt;{{cite book| last=Farrell| first=Harry| title=Swift justice: murder and vengeance in a California town| publisher=Saint Martin's Press Inc.| location=[[New York City|New York]]| pages=165, 255| year=1993| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8TFYPA-u4QkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, 20-year-old Coogan was the sole survivor of a car crash in eastern [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] that killed his father; his best friend, 19-year-old actor [[Junior Durkin]];&lt;ref name=frhfrppg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RYhRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IGkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4274%2C5172365 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |agency=Associated Press |title=Final rites held for young actor |date=May 8, 1935 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; their ranch foreman, Charles Jones; and actor and writer Robert J. Horner. The party was returning from a day of [[Mourning dove|dove]] hunting over the border in [[Mexico]] in early May. With his father at the wheel, the car was forced off the mountain highway near [[Pine Valley, California|Pine Valley]] by an oncoming vehicle and rolled down an embankment.&lt;ref name=bbfkiaaup&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4-csAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NCMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2896%2C901499 |newspaper=Bend Bulletin |location=Oregon |agency=United Press |title=Four killed in auto accident |date=May 6, 1935 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mjphm35&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DrBQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7yEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7145%2C6298835 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |agency=(photo)|title=Jackie Coogan hurt, four killed in accident |date=May 5, 1935 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jctcofcap&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a2ExAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IyIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6648%2C1024818 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |agency=Associated Press |title=Jackie Coogan tells court of fatal crash |date=April 6, 1936 |page=1, Final }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child star, Coogan earned an estimated $3 to $4 million. When he turned 21 in October 1935, his fortune was believed to be well intact.

However, Coogan found that the entire amount had been spent by his mother and stepfather, Arthur Bernstein, on fur coats, diamonds and other jewelry, and expensive cars. Bernstein had been a financial advisor for the family and married Coogan's mother in late 1936.&lt;ref name=pecsueap/&gt; Coogan's mother and stepfather claimed Jackie enjoyed himself and simply thought he was playing before the camera.

The legal battle focused attention on child actors and resulted in the 1939 enactment of the California Child Actor's Bill, often referred to as the "Coogan Law" or the "Coogan Act". It required that a child actor's employer set aside 15% of the earnings in a trust (called a Coogan account), and specified the actor's schooling, work hours, and time off.&lt;ref name="sag"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Coogan Law| url=http://www.sagaftra.org/content/coogan-law| publisher=[[SAG-AFTRA]]| accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Henry Widdifield''' (June 12, 1845 &amp;ndash; June 3, 1906) was an [[Ontario]] physician and political figure. He represented [[York North (Ontario provincial electoral district)|York North]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] as a [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal]] member from 1875 to 1888.

He was born in [[Whitchurch–Stouffville|Whitchurch]], [[Upper Canada]] in 1845, the son of Charles Ellis Widdifield, and studied medicine at [[Victoria University in the University of Toronto|Victoria College]] and [[St Thomas's Hospital Medical School]] in [[London]]. On his return to Canada, Widdifield set up practice in [[Newmarket, Ontario|Newmarket]]. He served as a coroner and [[justice of the peace]] of [[Victoria County, Ontario|Victoria County]]. He also served in the militia during the [[Fenian raids]]. He was whip for the provincial Liberal party from 1877 to 1883. Widdifield served as deputy Grand Master for the [[Freemason|Masonic]] order in the Toronto district and also served as provincial medical examiner for the order. In 1888, he resigned his seat in the assembly to accept the position of sheriff for [[York County, Ontario|York County]].

In 1965 [[Widdifield Secondary School]] in the [[Neighbourhoods in North Bay, Ontario|Widdifield District]] of [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]] was named after him.

'''Keanolani''' (July 7, 1847 – June 30, 1902) was a Hawaiian chiefess ([[aliʻi]]) of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. She was the illegitimate daughter of [[Abigail Maheha]] and King [[Kamehameha V]], who reigned from 1863 to 1872, and was born during a liaison between the two when they were students at the [[Royal School (Hawaii)|Chiefs' Children's School]] (later renamed the Royal School), a boarding school run by American missionaries for students of Hawaiian royal descent. Keanolani was raised by her father's half-sister [[Keʻelikōlani]]. Her illegitimate birth and unacknowledged parentage prevented her from succeeding to the Hawaiian throne when her father died without naming an heir, thus ending the reign of the [[House of Kamehameha]]. In 1873, she became a mistress of her uncle by marriage [[William Hoapili Kaʻauwai]]. In 1874, she became a supporter of the newly elected [[House of Kalākaua]]. She married and left descendants. Her name is also often spelled as '''Keano''' or '''Keanu'''. In one source, she is named as '''Keauoʻokalau'''.{{sfn|Muir|1952|page=10}}

[[File:Prince Lot Kapuaiwa (PP-97-9-007).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Prince [[Lot Kapuāiwa]], {{circa|1850}}]]
Keanolani was born July 7, 1847, on the island of [[Kauai|Kauaʻi]].{{sfn|Kaomea|2014|page=140}} Her birth occurred five months after her mother, thirteen-year-old [[Abigail Maheha]], had an arranged marriage to a commoner named Keaupuni, an expelled student from [[Lahainaluna Seminary]] and servant of her ''[[hānai]]'' (informally adopted) mother, Governess [[Kekauʻōnohi]] of Kauaʻi. Through Maheha, Keanolani was the granddaughter of High Chief Namaile and High Chiefess [[Kuini Liliha]], who was the [[Governors of Oahu|Royal Governor of Oʻahu]] from 1829 to 1831 and a political adversary of [[Kaʻahumanu|Queen Kaʻahumanu]], the [[Kuhina Nui]] (premier) during the reigns of [[Kamehameha II]] and [[Kamehameha III]].{{sfn|McKinzie|1983|pages=41–42}}{{sfn|Kam|2017|pages=70–72}}{{sfn|Cooke|Cooke|1937|pages=279–280}} Maheha was a former student at the [[Royal School (Hawaii)|Chiefs' Children's School]], later renamed the Royal School, a boarding school run by American missionaries [[Amos Starr Cooke]] and his wife Juliette Montague Cooke for students of Hawaiian royal descent. She was declared eligible for the throne of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] by King Kamehameha III.&lt;ref name="Polynesian1844"&gt;{{cite news|title=Princes and Chiefs eligible to be Rulers|newspaper=The Polynesian|location=Honolulu|date=July 20, 1844|volume=1|issue=9|page=1|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015408/1844-07-20/ed-1/seq-1/|access-date=July 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222092650/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015408/1844-07-20/ed-1/seq-1/|archive-date=December 22, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Van Dyke|2008|page=364}}{{sfn|Kaomea|2014|page=125}} However, the thirteen-year-old Maheha had left the school at the insistence of her teachers, and was married off to Keaupuni to cover an unexpected pregnancy.{{sfn|Kam|2017|pages=70–72}}{{sfn|Kaomea|2014|pages=139–144}} Keaupuni was not the biological father of the baby, as was later attested by Mele, a witness in the 1855 divorce suit between him and Maheha.{{sfn|Kam|2017|pages=70–72}}

Her father was not officially identified. However, during and after her lifetime, speculation has focused on two princes of the [[Kamehameha dynasty]]: the seventeen-year-old [[Moses Kekūāiwa]], who was the eldest boy at the Royal School, or his sixteen-year-old brother Lot Kapuāiwa, who later became King [[Kamehameha V]]. Evidence points toward Lot because Moses was expelled from the school two days before Maheha. He had also financially supported Maheha's husband Keaupuni. The entries from the period after September 1, 1845, were also torn out of Lot's school journal.{{sfn|Kam|2017|pages=70–72}}{{sfn|Kaomea|2014|pages=139–144}}{{sfn|Walker|Ahlo|Johnson|2000|page=78}}&lt;ref name="Keawe1903"&gt;{{cite news|last=Keawe|first=J.

[[File:Hoapili Kaauwai and Kiliwehi.jpg|thumb|Keaonolani became the mistress of her uncle by marriage [[William Hoapili Kaʻauwai]] (left), who was initially married to her half-aunt [[Kiliwehi]] (right).]]
While still married to her first husband Lihilihi, Keanolani became the mistress of [[William Hoapili Kaʻauwai]], an [[Church of Hawaii|Anglican]] chaplain and a high chief of [[Maui]]an descent who had divorced her half-aunt [[Kiliwehi]] in 1872. During this period, Hoapili and Keanolani were partisans of King [[Kalākaua]], who had been elected as monarch in 1874 after the death of King Lunalilo. Hoapili was promised the position of Royal Chamberlain in the new ruling household.{{sfn|Muir|1952|pages=5–13}}{{sfn|Kaeo|Queen Emma|1976|pages=112–114}} [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Queen Emma]], the widow of [[Kamehameha IV]] and former patron of Hoapili and Kiliwehi, noted the illicit affair in her letters in 1873. Commenting on September 20, Emma wrote, "Hoapili and Keano are at David’s [Kalākaua's] Hamohamo. It is said she is with child by him again." Later, on September 26, she noted, "Keano was here last evening and appeared to be looking thick round the waist. She reports Kiliwehi recovering under Dr. [[Ferdinand William Hutchison|Hutchison]]’s treatment...."{{sfn|Kaeo|Queen Emma|1976|pages=112–114}} Keanolani had an illegitimate son which she named William Hoapili Kaʻauwai II, born on January 31, 1874. The elder Hoapili died on March 30, 1874.{{sfn|Muir|1952|pages=5–13}}&lt;ref name="Hoapili"/&gt;

Keanolani became a friend of [[Queen Kapiolani|Queen Kapiʻolani]], the wife of King Kalākaua. Few details exist on her life after this point until her death. In later life, she lived on the premises of Pualeilani, the [[Waikīkī]] residence of the queen. She continued living at Pualeilani when her nephews Princes [[David Kawānanakoa]] and [[Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole]] inherited the property.&lt;ref name="Keanolani" /&gt; At this point, the Hawaiian monarchy had been [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrown in 1893]] and the islands subsequently annexed by the United States in 1898. Despite this, her rank was acknowledged during the birthday reception of the former Queen [[Liliʻuokalani]] in 1901. The press initially described her as "old and mentally infirm" but also commented favorably on her noble bearing and knowledge of court etiquette.&lt;ref name="1901Birthday"&gt;{{cite news|title=Royal Luaus Given By Liliuokalani|newspaper=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|location=Honolulu|date=September 3, 1901|volume=|issue=|pages=9, 13|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1901-09-03/ed-1/seq-9/|access-date=July 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180716111726/https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1901-09-03/ed-1/seq-9/|archive-date=July 16, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}; {{cite news|title=Royal Luaus Given By Liliuokalani|newspaper=The Hawaiian Gazette|location=Honolulu|date=September 3, 1901|volume=|issue=|page=5|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1901-09-03/ed1/seq-5/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that she "swept majestically along amongst the throng as if she were a reigning queen"&lt;ref name="Keanolani" /&gt; and "greeted the Queen as one high chieftess [sic] to another."&lt;ref name="1901Birthday" /&gt;

{{Life in the Universe}}
Whether there is '''life on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]''', the largest moon of [[Saturn]], is at present an open question and a topic of scientific assessment and research. Titan is far colder than Earth, and its surface lacks stable liquid [[water]], factors which have led some scientists to consider life there unlikely. On the other hand, its thick atmosphere is chemically active and rich in carbon compounds. On the surface there are bodies of liquid [[methane]] and [[ethane]], and it is likely that there is a layer of liquid water under its ice shell; some scientists speculate that these liquid mixes may provide pre-biotic chemistry for [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|living cells different from those on Earth]].

In June 2010, scientists analysing data from the ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' mission reported anomalies in the atmosphere near the surface which could be consistent with the presence of methane-producing organisms, but may alternatively be due to non-living chemical or meteorological processes.&lt;ref name="life?"/&gt; The ''Cassini–Huygens'' mission was not equipped to look directly for micro-organisms or to provide a thorough inventory of complex [[organic compound]]s.

==Chemistry==

Titan's consideration as an environment for the study of prebiotic chemistry or potentially exotic life stems in large part due to the diversity of the organic chemistry that occurs in its atmosphere, driven by photochemical reactions in its outer layers. The following chemicals have been detected in Titan's upper atmosphere by ''Cassini'''s [[mass spectrometer]]:

As mass spectrometry identifies the atomic mass of a compound but not its structure, additional research is required to identify the exact compound that has been detected.  Where the compounds have been identified in the literature, their chemical formula has been replaced by their name above.  The figures in Magee (2009) involve corrections for high pressure background.  Other compounds believed to be indicated by the data and associated models include [[ammonia]], [[polyyne]]s, [[amine]]s, [[ethylenimine]], [[deuterium hydride]], [[allene]], [[Butadiene|1,3 butadiene]] and any number of more complex chemicals in lower concentrations, as well as carbon dioxide and limited quantities of water vapour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Surface temperature==
Due to its distance from the Sun, Titan is much colder than Earth. Its surface temperature is about 90 K (−179&amp;nbsp;°C, or −290&amp;nbsp;°F). At these temperatures, water ice—if present—does not melt, evaporate or sublime, but remains solid. Because of the extreme cold and also because of lack of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the atmosphere, scientists such as [[Jonathan Lunine]] have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for [[extraterrestrial life]], than as an experiment for examining hypotheses on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1130.html| title=Saturn's Moon Titan: Prebiotic Laboratory|publisher=Astrobiology Magazine |date=August 11, 2004|accessdate=2004-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the usual surface temperature on Titan is not compatible with liquid water, calculations by Lunine and others suggest that meteor strikes could create occasional "impact oases"—craters in which liquid water might persist for hundreds of years or longer, which would enable water-based organic chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

However, Lunine does not rule out life in an environment of liquid methane and ethane, and has written about what discovery of such a life form (even if very primitive) would imply about the prevalence of life in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.0762 Jonathan Lunine "Saturn’s Titan: A Strict Test for Life’s Cosmic Ubiquity"] (accepted for publication in ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society''), July 21, 2009
(Revised November 7, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Past hypothesis about the temperature===
[[File:PIA20016-SaturnMoon-Titan-20151113.jpg|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Titan - infrared view&lt;br&gt;(November 13, 2015).&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the 1970s, astronomers found unexpectedly high levels of [[infrared]] emissions from Titan.&lt;ref name=sagan/&gt; One possible explanation for this was the surface was warmer than expected, due to a [[greenhouse effect]]. Some estimates of the surface temperature even approached temperatures in the cooler regions of Earth. There was, however, another possible explanation for the infrared emissions: Titan's surface was very cold, but the upper atmosphere was heated due to absorption of ultraviolet light by molecules such as ethane, ethylene and acetylene.&lt;ref name=sagan&gt;{{cite book| title=Broca's Brain - the Romance of Science| first=Carl| last= Sagan| publisher=Hodder and Stoughton| date=1979| isbn= 0-340-24424-0}} pp 185–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1979, [[Pioneer 11]], the first space probe to conduct fly-by observations of Saturn and its moons, sent data showing Titan's surface to be extremely cold by Earth standards, and much below the temperatures generally associated with [[planetary habitability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=March 26, 2007 |title=The Pioneer Missions |publisher=NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory |work=Pioneer Project |url= http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/missions/archive/pioneer.html |accessdate= 2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future temperature===

Titan may become warmer in the future.&lt;ref name=lorenz/&gt; Five to six billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a [[red giant]], surface temperatures could rise to ~{{convert|200|K|°C|-1|abbr=on}}, high enough for stable oceans of a water–ammonia mixture to exist on its surface. As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect on its surface and enabling the greenhouse effect created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create an environment agreeable to exotic forms of life, and will persist for several hundred million years.&lt;ref name=lorenz/&gt; This was sufficient time for simple life to evolve on Earth, although the presence of ammonia on Titan could cause the same chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.&lt;ref name=lorenz&gt;{{cite web|title=Titan under a red giant sun: A new kind of "habitable" moon|author1=Ralph D.

==Absence of surface liquid water==

The lack of [[liquid water]] on Titan's surface was cited by NASA [[astrobiology|astrobiologist]] Andrew Pohorille in 2009 as an argument against life there. Pohorille considers that water is important not only as the solvent used by "the only life we know" but also because its chemical properties are  "uniquely suited to promote self-organization of organic matter". He has questioned whether prospects for finding life on Titan's surface are sufficient to justify the expense of a mission that would look for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://astrobiology2.arc.nasa.gov/focus-groups/current/origins-of-life/articles/comment-on-titan-first/ | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130902170025/http://astrobiology2.arc.nasa.gov/focus-groups/current/origins-of-life/articles/comment-on-titan-first/ | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2013-09-02 | title = Comment on Titan First | accessdate = 2013-09-02 | last = Pohorille | first = Andrew | date = 2009-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible subsurface liquid water==

Laboratory simulations have led to the suggestion that enough organic material exists on Titan to start a chemical evolution analogous to what is thought to have started life on Earth. While the analogy assumes the presence of liquid water for longer periods than is currently observable, several hypotheses suggest that liquid water from an impact could be preserved under a frozen isolation layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Artemivia N. |author2=Lunine J |title = Cratering on Titan: impact melt, ejecta, and the fate of surface organics|date = 2003|journal = Icarus|volume = 164| pages = 471–480|doi=10.1016/S0019-1035(03)00148-9|bibcode=2003Icar..164..471A}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed that ammonia oceans could exist deep below the surface;&lt;ref name=Grasset2000&gt;

For example, the atmospheric methane and nitrogen could be examined for biogenic origin.&lt;ref name=Fortes2000/&gt;

Data published in 2012 obtained from NASA's ''Cassini'' spacecraft, have strengthened evidence that Titan likely harbors a layer of liquid water under its ice shell.&lt;ref name="subsurface"&gt;{{Cite news |author1=Jia-Rui Cook |author2=Dwayne Brown |work=NASA News release |title=Cassini Finds Likely Subsurface Ocean on Saturn Moon |date=2012-06-28 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/cassini20120628.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of complex molecules==

Titan is the only known natural satellite (moon) in the Solar System that has a fully developed [[atmosphere of Titan|atmosphere]] that consists of more than trace gases. Titan's atmosphere is thick, chemically active, and is known to be rich in [[organic compound]]s; this has led to speculation about whether chemical precursors of life may have been generated there.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt; The atmosphere also contains [[hydrogen]] gas, which is cycling through the atmosphere and the surface environment, and which living things comparable to Earth [[methanogen]]s could combine with some of the organic compounds (such as [[acetylene]]) to obtain energy.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt;

The [[Miller–Urey experiment]] and several following experiments have shown that with an atmosphere similar to that of Titan and the addition of [[UV radiation]], complex molecules and polymer substances like [[tholin]]s can be generated. The reaction starts with [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] of [[nitrogen]] and methane, forming [[hydrogen cyanide]] and [[acetylene]]. Further reactions have been studied extensively.&lt;ref name=Raulin2002&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Space Science Reviews|volume= 104|issue = 1–2|pages = 377–394|date= 2002|doi = 10.1023/A:1023636623006|title = Organic chemistry and exobiology on Titan|author1=Raulin F. |author2=Owen T. |bibcode=2002SSRv..104..377R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, [[Sarah Hörst]] of the [[University of Arizona]] reported finding the five [[nucleotide bases]]—building blocks of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]—among the many compounds produced when energy was applied to a combination of gases like those in Titan's atmosphere. Horst also found [[amino acids]], the building blocks of [[protein]]. She said it was the first time nucleotide bases and amino acids had been found in such an experiment without liquid water being present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | date=October 8, 2010 | title=Titan's haze may hold ingredients for life | work=Astronomy | url=http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=10302 | accessdate=2010-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, NASA reported that complex [[organic chemicals]] could arise on Titan based on studies simulating the [[Titan (moon)#Atmosphere|atmosphere]] of Titan.&lt;ref name="PhysOrg-20130403"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=NASA team investigates complex chemistry at Titan |url=http://phys.org/news/2013-04-nasa-team-complex-chemistry-titan.html |date=April 3, 2013 |work=[[Phys.Org]] |accessdate=April 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) were detected in the [[upper atmosphere]] of Titan.&lt;ref name="IAA-20130606"&gt;{{cite news |last=López-Puertas |first=Manuel |title=PAH's in Titan's Upper Atmosphere |url=http://www.iaa.es/content/pahs-titans-upper-atmosphere |date=June 6, 2013 |work=[[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] |accessdate=June 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has suggested that polyimine could readily function as a building block in Titan's conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Polymorphism and electronic structure of polyimine and its potential significance for prebiotic chemistry on Titan | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/29/8121.full.pdf | date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Titan's atmosphere produces significant quantities of hydrogen cyanide, which readily polymerize into forms which can capture light energy in Titan's surface conditions.  As of yet, the answer to what happens with Titan's cyanide is unknown; while it is rich in the upper atmosphere where it is created, it is depleted at the surface, suggesting that there is some sort of reaction consuming it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cornellsun.com/2016/09/12/saturns-moon-titan-might-be-able-to-support-life/ | date=2016-09-13 |title=Saturn’s Moon, Titan, Might Be Able to Support Life | author=Victor Aguillar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothesis==

===Hydrocarbons as solvents===
{{see also|Hypothetical types of biochemistry}}
[[Image:Liquid lakes on titan.jpg|thumb|300px|Hydrocarbon lakes on Titan (''Cassini'' radar image from 2006]]
Although all living things on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid water as a solvent, it is conceivable that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane.&lt;ref name=methanesolvent&gt;Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&amp;page=74 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Water is a stronger solvent than hydrocarbons,&lt;ref name=methlife/&gt; however, water is more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through [[hydrolysis]].&lt;ref name=methanesolvent/&gt; A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.&lt;ref name=methanesolvent/&gt;

Titan appears to have [[Lakes of Titan|lakes]] of liquid [[ethane]] or liquid [[methane]] on its surface, as well as rivers and seas, which some scientific models suggest could support hypothetical [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|non-water-based life]].&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"&gt;{{Cite news |author1=Jia-Rui Cook |author2=Cathy Weselby |work=NASA News release |title=What is Consuming Hydrogen and Acetylene on Titan? |date=2010-06-03 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/titan20100603.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Hadhazy |first=Adam |title=Scientists Confirm Liquid Lake, Beach on Saturn's Moon Titan |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=July 30, 2008 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=liquid-lake-on-titan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |work=[[Space.com]] |title=Strange Discovery on Titan Leads to Speculation of Alien Life |date=7 June 2010 |url=http://www.space.com/8547-strange-discovery-titan-leads-speculation-alien-life.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been speculated that life could exist in the liquid methane and ethane that form rivers and lakes on Titan's surface, just as organisms on Earth live in water.&lt;ref name=mckay/&gt; Such hypothetical creatures would take in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in place of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, react it with [[acetylene]] instead of [[glucose]], and produce methane instead of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name=mckay/&gt; By comparison, some [[methanogens]] on Earth obtain energy by reacting hydrogen with carbon dioxide, producing methane and water.

In 2005, [[astrobiologist]]s [[Christopher McKay (planetary scientist)|Chris McKay]] and Heather Smith predicted that if methanogenic life is consuming atmospheric hydrogen in sufficient volume, it will have a measurable effect on the [[mixing ratio]] in the [[troposphere]] of Titan. The effects predicted included a level of acetylene much lower than otherwise expected, as well as a reduction in the concentration of hydrogen itself.&lt;ref name=mckay&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Icarus|volume= 178|issue = 1|pages = 274–276|date= 2005|doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2005.05.018|title = Possibilities for methanogenic life in liquid methane on the surface of Titan|author1=McKay, C. P. |author2=Smith, H. D. |bibcode=2005Icar..178..274M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence consistent with these predictions was reported in June 2010 by Darrell Strobel of [[Johns Hopkins University]], who analysed measurements of hydrogen concentration in the upper and lower atmosphere. Strobel found that the hydrogen concentration in the upper atmosphere is so much larger than near the surface that the physics of [[diffusion]] leads to hydrogen flowing downwards at a rate of roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per second. Near the surface the downward-flowing hydrogen apparently disappears.&lt;ref name=methlife&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Consuming Hydrogen and Acetylene on Titan? |publisher=NASA/JPL |date=2010 |accessdate=2010-06-06 |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-190 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629185640/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-190 |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mckay/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Molecular hydrogen in Titan’s atmosphere: Implications of the measured tropospheric and thermospheric mole fractions |author=Darrell F.

Chris McKay agreed with Strobel that presence of life, as suggested in McKay's 2005 article, is a possible explanation for the findings about hydrogen and acetylene, but also cautioned that other explanations are currently more likely: namely the possibility that the results are due to [[human error]], to a meteorological process, or to the presence of some mineral [[catalyst]] enabling hydrogen and acetylene to react chemically.&lt;ref name="life?"&gt;{{cite web|title= Have We Discovered Evidence For Life On Titan?|author=Mckay, Chris|date=2010|url=http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/tharriso/ast105/making_sense.php.html| publisher=[[New Mexico State University]], [http://artsci.nmsu.edu/ College of Arts and Sciences], [http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/ Department of Astronomy]| accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/13639-alien-life-methane-habitable-zone.html Could Alien Life Exist in the Methane Habitable Zone?] Keith Cooper, Astrobiology Magazine16 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that such a catalyst, one effective at −178&amp;nbsp;°C (95 K), is presently unknown and would in itself be a startling discovery, though less startling than discovery of an extraterrestrial life form.&lt;ref name="life?"/&gt;

The June 2010 findings gave rise to considerable media interest, including a report in the British newspaper, the [[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]], which spoke of clues to the existence of "primitive aliens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=June 5, 2010 |title=Titan: Nasa scientists discover evidence 'that alien life exists on Saturn's moon'|author=Andew Hough|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/7805069/Titan-Nasa-scientists-discover-evidence-that-alien-life-exists-on-Saturns-moon.html |accessdate= 2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell membranes===
A hypothetical [[cell membrane]] capable of functioning in liquid [[methane]] was modeled in February 2015.&lt;ref name=azotosomemodel&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2015-02-life-saturn-moon-titan.html Life 'not as we know it' possible on Saturn's moon Titan]&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed chemical base for these membranes is [[acrylonitrile]], which has been detected on Titan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10079158 | doi=10.1006/jmsp.1998.7795 | volume=194 | title=Absolute Intensities of the Infrared Bands of Gaseous Acrylonitrile | year=1999 | journal=J Mol Spectrosc | pages=206–210 |vauthors=Khlifi M, Nollet M, Paillous P, Bruston P, Raulin F, Bénilan Y, Khanna RK |bibcode = 1999JMoSp.194..206K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Called an "[[azotosome]]" ('nitrogen body'), formed from "azote", French for nitrogen, and "soma", Greek for body, it lacks the phosphorus and oxygen found in [[phospholipid]]s on Earth but contains nitrogen.  Despite the very different chemical structure and external environment, its properties are surprisingly similar, including autoformation of sheets, flexibility, stability, and other properties.

An analysis of ''Cassini'' data, completed in 2017, confirmed substantial amounts of acrylonitrile in Titan's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="SP-20170728"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Saturn Moon Titan Has Molecules That Could Help Make Cell Membranes |url=https://www.space.com/37653-saturn-moon-titan-cell-membrane-molecules.html |date=28 July 2017 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=29 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA-20170728"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Palmer, Maureen Y. et al. |title=ALMA detection and astrobiological potential of vinyl cyanide on Titan |url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/7/e1700022 |date=28 July 2017 |journal=[[Science Advances]] |volume =3 |number=7 |doi= 10.1126/sciadv.1700022 |accessdate=29 July 2017 |bibcode=2017SciA....3E0022P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative habitability===

In order to assess the likelihood of finding any sort of life on various planets and moons, [[Dirk Schulze-Makuch]] and other scientists have developed a [[Planetary Habitability Index]] which takes into account factors including characteristics of the surface and atmosphere, availability of energy, solvents and organic compounds.&lt;ref name=PHI&gt;{{cite web|title= Which alien worlds are most livable?|publisher=msnbc.com| date=2011-11-22|author=Alan Boyle |accessdate=2012-01-27|url= http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/11/22/8956644-which-alien-worlds-are-most-livable}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this index, based on data available in late 2011, the model suggests that Titan has the highest current habitability rating of any known world, other than Earth.&lt;ref name=PHI/&gt;

===Titan as a test case===

While the ''Cassini–Huygens'' mission was not equipped to provide evidence for [[biosignature]]s or complex organics, it showed an environment on Titan that is similar, in some ways, to ones theorized for the primordial Earth.&lt;ref name=Raulin2005&gt;

Titan is presented as a test case for the relation between chemical reactivity and life, in a 2007 report on life's limiting conditions prepared by a committee of scientists under the [[United States National Research Council]]. The committee, chaired by [[John Baross]], considered that "if life is an intrinsic property of chemical reactivity, life should exist on Titan. Indeed, for life not to exist on Titan, we would have to argue that life is not an intrinsic property of the reactivity of carbon-containing molecules under conditions where they are stable..."&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&amp;page=74]; The National Academies Press, 2007; pages 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Grinspoon]], one of the scientists who in 2005 proposed that hypothetical organisms on Titan might use hydrogen and acetylene as an energy source,&lt;ref&gt;

He suggests that, just as Earth's environment and its organisms have evolved together, the same thing is likely to have happened on other worlds with life on them. In Grinspoon's view, worlds that are "geologically and meteorologically alive are much more likely to be biologically alive as well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Leslie Mullen | date=September 22, 2005 | title=The Living Worlds Hypothesis | work=Astrobiology Magazine | url=http://www.astrobio.net/interview/1720/the-living-worlds-hypothesis | accessdate=2010-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panspermia or independent origin===

An alternate explanation for life's hypothetical existence on Titan has been proposed: if life were to be found on Titan, it could have originated from Earth in a process called [[panspermia]]. It is theorized that large asteroid and cometary impacts on Earth's surface have caused hundreds of millions of fragments of microbe-laden rock to escape Earth's gravity. Calculations indicate that a number of these would encounter many of the bodies in the Solar System, including Titan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4819370.stm |title=Earth could seed Titan with life |work=BBC News |date=March 18, 2006 |accessdate=2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gladman, Brett |author2=Dones, Luke |author3=Levinson, Harold F. |author4=Burns, Joseph A. |title = Impact Seeding and Reseeding in the Inner Solar System|date = 2005|journal = Astrobiology|volume = 5|pages = 483–496 |doi=10.1089/ast.2005.5.483|pmid = 16078867|issue = 4|bibcode=2005AsBio...5..483G}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Jonathan Lunine has argued that any living things in Titan's cryogenic hydrocarbon lakes would need to be so different chemically from Earth life that it would not be possible for one to be the ancestor of the other.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.0762 Jonathan Lunine "Saturn’s Titan: A Strict Test for Life’s Cosmic Ubiquity"] (accepted for publication in ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society''), July 21, 2009 (Revised November 7, 2009), page 13&lt;/ref&gt; In Lunine's view, presence of organisms in Titan's lakes would mean a second, independent origin of life within the Solar System, implying that life has a high probability of emerging on habitable worlds throughout the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.0762 Jonathan Lunine "Saturn’s Titan: A Strict Test for Life’s Cosmic Ubiquity"] (accepted for publication in ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society''), July 21, 2009 (Revised November 7, 2009), page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed missions==
{{See also|Titan (moon)#Proposed or conceptual missions}}

The proposed [[Titan Mare Explorer]] mission, a [[Discovery Program|Discovery-class]] lander that would splash down in a lake, "would have the possibility of detecting life", according to astronomer [[Chris Impey]] of the [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=Jan 31, 2011 |title=Jan 31st: Life on Titan|author=Chris Impey|publisher=[[365 Days of Astronomy]]|url= http://365daysofastronomy.org/2011/01/31/january-31st-life-on-titan/ |accessdate= 2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed [[Dragonfly (spacecraft)|Dragonfly]] [[rotorcraft]] probe mission is intended to land on solid ground and relocate many times.

This '''list of peace activists''' includes people who have proactively advocated [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]], philosophical, and non-military resolution of major territorial or ideological disputes through [[nonviolent]] means and methods. Peace [[activist]]s usually work with others in the overall [[anti-war movement|anti-war]] and [[peace movement]]s to focus the world's attention on what they perceive to be the irrationality of violent conflicts, decisions, and actions. They thus initiate and facilitate wide public dialogues intended to nonviolently alter long-standing societal agreements directly relating to, and held in place by, the various violent, habitual, and historically fearful thought-processes residing at the core of these conflicts, with the intention of peacefully ending the conflicts themselves.

}}'''''Man after Man: An Anthropology of the Future''''' is a 1990 [[speculative evolution]] book written by Scottish geologist [[Dougal Dixon]] and illustrated by Philip Hood. The book also features a foreword by [[Brian Aldiss]]. ''Man After Man'' explores a hypothetical future path of [[human evolution]] set from 200 years in the future to 5 million years in the future, with several future human species [[Evolution|evolving]] through [[genetic engineering]] and natural means through the course of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Man After Man|last=Dixon|first=Dougal|publisher=Blandford Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0713720716|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Man after Man'' is Dixon's third work on speculative evolution, following ''[[After Man]]'' (1981), which explored the animals of a hypothetical world 50 million years in the future where humanity had gone extinct, and ''[[The New Dinosaurs]]'' (1988), which explored the animals of a world where the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event]] never occurred. Unlike the previous two books, which were written much like [[Field guide|field guides]] and explored factual natural processes through fictional examples and worlds, the focus of ''Man after Man'' lies much on the individual perspectives of future human individuals of various species, mainly focused on how they perceive the changing climate, which they are specifically engineered to be adapted to, around themselves.

==Plot summary==
200 years hence (the year 2190 A.D.) [[climate change]] has changed the face of the planet. With rising sea levels swallowing coastal cities and the environmental impact of overpopulation becoming apparent in a lack of resources, [[Societal collapse|civilization is slowly collapsing]], with a few selected humans escaping [[Earth]] to [[Space colonization|colonize space]]. To effectively construct great starships, governments have engineered new human species to aid in gathering resources underwater - the aquamorph (''Homo aquaticus''), with [[Gill|gills]] instead of lungs - and species to aid in construction in the [[vacuum]] of space - the vacuumorph (''Homo caelestis''). 

300 years hence, the [[anatomically modern humans]] that stayed behind on Earth have split into The Hitek (''Homo sapiens machinadiumentum''), almost totally dependent on [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] technology, [[Human enhancement|augmenting]] and keeping their bodies alive way past their natural lifespans, and their handlers (still ''Homo sapiens sapiens''). Though the older genetically engineered species in space and underwater have become extinct as a result of fulfilling their purpose and being sterile, a new species of fertile underwater human, the Aquatics (''Piscanthropus submarinus'') are created as a final project by the genetic engineering facilities before they are shut down.

500 years hence, the Hitek pursue to construct genetically altered humans to sustainably occupy niches in the ecologically recovering world. These new species include the [[Plain|plains]]-dweller (''Homo campis fabricatus'') designed to live on open grasslands with the adaptations of a large herbivorous mammal, the [[forest]]-dweller (''Homo silvis fabricatus'') created to live in [[rainforests]], the [[tundra]]-dweller (''Homo glacis fabricatus'') adapted to a [[polar climate]] and the [[Temperate Woodland|temperate woodland]]-dweller (''Homo virgultis fabricatus''), superficially similar to the ancient [[Australopithecine|australopithecines]]. Genetic material used to make these species is derived from the Andlas, anatomically modern humans who mostly live as farmers and fishermen (the word "Andlas" being speech corruption of "Handlers"). 

1000 years hence, some Hitek choose to abandon their "mechanical cradles" in favor of artificially created organs and "biological cradles", becoming a new species known as the Tics (''Homo sapiens accessiomembrum''). Both the Hitek and the Tics artificially manufacture food products to sustain themselves, relying on [[Solar energy|solar]] and [[marine energy]] harvesting to fuel their processing facilities. A [[magnetic reversal]] results in the failure of the navigation, communication and energy harvesting technologies that the Hitek and Tics rely on, causing their extinction. The magnetic reversal also impacts the farming, animal husbandry and hunting of the Andlas, leading to their (and by extension ''Homo sapiens'' as a whole) extinction. The disaster leaves the genetically engineered animal-like species as the sole living human descendants.

As a result of the extinction of ''Homo sapiens'', these humans can no longer be genetically tweaked and altered in labs and instead they begin to evolve through [[natural selection]] and other natural evolutionary processes, resulting in many new and diverse forms over the course of several millions of years. These new species range from the memory people (''Homo mensproavadorum'') that through their genes can [[Genetic memory (psychology)|recall memories of previous generations]], [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] humans (symbionts) consisting of a symbiont carrier (''Baiulus moderatorum'') providing movement and protection against the cold and a hunter symbiont (''Moderator baiuli''), colonial and [[Beehive|hive]]-building humans with a single reproductive parent (socials, ''Alvearanthropus desertus''), [[Parasitism|parasitic]] humans (''Nananthropus parasitus'') attaching themselves with sharp teeth and claws to the flesh of their [[Host (biology)|hosts]] (''Penarius pinguis''), [[goblin]]-like fishing humans (fish-eaters, ''Piscator longidigitus''), [[ant]]-eating humans (ant-men, ''Formifossor angustus'') and saber-toothed predatory humans (spiketooths, ''Acudens ferox''). 

After five million years of uninterrupted evolution, the spacefaring descendants of those humans that escaped into space return to the planet. No longer recognizing the planet as their home world and bearing little resemblance to their original ancestors after five millions of years of genetic engineering, the spacefarers dramatically [[Xenoforming|xenoform]] Earth and cover it in vast domed alien cities. The spacefarers wear pressurized suits and use [[Cyborg|cyborg-technology]] to fuse the bodies of the few human species they find useful on the planet with air tanks and respiration systems. Genetic engineering is used to modify the human descendants on Earth into giant building humans ("engineered pack-animals") and tiny humans working intricate machinery to aid in city construction and maintenance. Genetically modified species are also created for other purposes, such as [[antelope]]-like humans that serve as mounts and grotesque massive humans whose flesh is processed and consumed as food. As with the civilization of modern man and the Hitek before, this new era of civilization eventually falls apart, the spacefarers leaving Earth in ruins after consuming all the resources the planet had to offer. All terrestrial life on the planet perishes as the atmosphere is almost emptied of oxygen, leaving most of the human descendants extinct. Only a [[deep sea]] descendant of the aquatics, ''Piscanthropus profundus'', survives the [[extinction event]] and continues to evolve, expressing curiosity in what lies above the water.

== Development ==
Dixon's previous [[speculative evolution]] book projects, ''[[After Man]]'' (1981) and ''[[The New Dinosaurs]]'' (1988), used fictional examples to examplify real-life factual natural processes. ''After Man'' focused on the processes within evolution and projected them into a hypothetical future scenario set 50 million years after the extinction of mankind, where various hypothetical future animal species were used to explain the concepts within evolution. ''The New Dinosaurs'', meanwhile, had a focus on the science of [[zoogeography]], using fictional species in a world where the [[Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event]] never happened to explain the process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite interview|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/of-after-man-the-new-dinosaurs-and-greenworld-an-interview-with-dougal-dixon/|title=Of After Man, The New Dinosaurs and Greenworld: an interview with Dougal Dixon|last=Naish|first=Darren|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, ''Man After Man'' was intended to be a project where fictional examples would be used to explain factual processes, like the previous books. The original idea involved mankind avoiding catastrophes such as [[overpopulation]] and [[Mass Starvation|mass starvation]] by inventing [[time travel]] and moving 50 million years into the future to re-establish civilization. This original ''Man After Man'' would have been set in the same world as ''After Man'' and would have focused on man-made catastrophes destroying the ecosystem established in the previous book. Dixon was reluctant to be involved in the final version of the project, which instead focused on changing climate conditions through the eyes of future human species engineered to adapt to them,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview|url=http://www.ough.gr/index.php?mod=articles&amp;op=view&amp;id=562&amp;lang=en|title=An interview with Dougal Dixon - OUGH.gr|website=OUGH.gr|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has in subsequent interviews referred to it as a "disaster of a project".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The original ''Man After Man'' concept, mankind destroying an established ecosystem, was later used by Dixon for another project where mankind colonized an alien planet with a complex and unique ecosystem. This project, published as the book ''Greenworld'' in 2010 (though so far only released in [[Japan]]) follows human colonization of the planet Greenworld over the course of a thousand years, showing how mankind affects its ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] (AP) called it "the most infamous brawl in NBA history",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2012/news/04/23/top-10-hits.ap/index.html|title=Top 10 list of worst NBA fights, cheap shots|agency=Associated Press|publisher=National Basketball Association|accessdate=April 20, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528065106/http://www.nba.com/2012/news/04/23/top-10-hits.ap/index.html|archivedate=May 28, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the media has dubbed it the "worst night in NBA history". 

With 45.9 seconds left in the game,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8VYYLO6z6w&lt;/ref&gt; Pistons [[Center (basketball)|center]] [[Ben Wallace]] went up for a layup, but was [[Personal foul (basketball)|fouled]] by Pacers [[small forward]] [[Metta World Peace|Ron Artest]]. Furious for being fouled when the game had already been decided, Wallace pushed Artest. A fight broke out on the court between several players. After the fight was broken up, a fan threw a drink from the stands at Artest while he was lying on the scorer's table. Artest immediately charged after the fan, sparking a massive brawl between players and spectators that stretched from the seats down to the court and lasted several minutes.

After the game, the NBA suspended nine players for a total of 146 games, which led to $11 million in salary being lost by the players. Five players were also charged with assault, and eventually sentenced to a year of probation and community service. Five fans also faced criminal charges and were banned from attending Pistons home games for life. The fight also led the NBA to increase security between players and fans, and to limit the sale of alcohol in games.

==Before the brawl==
The meeting was the first between the two teams since the [[2003–04 NBA season|previous season]]'s [[2004 NBA Playoffs#Conference Finals: (1) Indiana Pacers vs. (3) Detroit Pistons|Eastern Conference Finals]], which the Pistons won in six games en route to their first [[2004 NBA Finals|NBA title]] since the [[Detroit Pistons#1979.E2.80.931994: The Bad Boys era|"Bad Boys" era]] of the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2004.html|title=2004 NBA Playoff Summary|work=basketball-reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=September 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused the game to receive much hype from the media and fans. Having won two games in a row, the Pacers came into the game with a 6–2 record, while the Pistons, the defending champions, began their season 4–3. The game was televised nationally on [[NBA on ESPN|ESPN]],&lt;ref name="abrams20120229"/&gt; as well as on the Pacers' and Pistons' local broadcast affiliates, [[Fox Sports Midwest]] and [[WDIV-TV|WDIV]] (Detroit's NBC affiliate), respectively.

The game, like many previous meetings between the two teams, was dominated by defense. The Pacers got off to a quick start, opening up a 20-point lead with seven minutes to go before halftime. The Pistons managed to cut into the lead, trailing by 16 points by halftime. The Pistons opened the third quarter with a 9–2 run, but the Pacers ended it with a buzzer-beating three-pointer and a layup from [[Jamaal Tinsley]] heading into the fourth quarter. [[Richard Hamilton (basketball)|Richard Hamilton]] and [[Lindsey Hunter]] started the last quarter with consecutive three-point field goals, as the Pistons cut into the lead again. But [[Stephen Jackson]]'s back-to-back field goals pushed the lead back to 93–79 with 3:52 remaining, essentially putting the Pistons away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/game_041119.html|title=Big Win Marred by Ugly Brawl|date=November 19, 2004|accessdate=September 27, 2008|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671fUB6NY?url=http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/game_041119.html|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lopsided score near the end of the game, most key players on both teams remained in the game.&lt;ref name="recap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=241119008|agency=Associated Press|title=Carlisle: 'I was fighting for my life out there'|date=November 19, 2004|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=April 26, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041125092458/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=241119008|archivedate=November 25, 2004|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pacers were led by the 24-point effort of Ron Artest, who scored 17 in the first quarter. [[Jermaine O'Neal]] notched a [[Double (basketball)#Double-double|double-double]] with 20 points and 13 rebounds. Tinsley had 13 points, eight assists and a career-high eight steals. Hamilton led the Pistons with 20 points. [[Rasheed Wallace]] and Ben Wallace both recorded a double-double.

The brawl began with 45.9&amp;nbsp;seconds remaining in the game, when Indiana led 97–82. Pistons center Ben Wallace was fouled from behind by Pacers small forward Ron Artest, now known as [[Metta World Peace]], who slapped him across the back of the head during a layup attempt. Wallace later said that Artest had warned him he would be hit.&lt;ref name="abrams20120229"/&gt; Wallace responded by shoving Artest in the face with both hands, causing players from both teams to quickly get in between them as they attempted to keep Wallace and Artest separated.&lt;ref name="firstreport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1927380|title=Artest, Jackson charge Palace stands|date=November 21, 2004|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=April 26, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671frX7XJ?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1927380|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="knightridder"&gt;{{cite web|title=FOUL PLAY IN AUBURN HILLS: Pacers in brawl with Palace fans |url=http://www.freep.com/sports/pistons/brawl20e_20041120.htm|work=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=April 17, 2012|date=November 21, 2004|last=Elrick|first=M.

Pistons coach [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] was not yet very concerned, because fights in the NBA rarely lasted for more than a few seconds. During the altercation, Artest lay down on the scorer's table to relax while putting on a headset to speak with Pacers radio broadcaster Mark Boyle. The microphone was not live. Boyle recalled that the broadcasting team knew Artest's personality and "there was no way we were going to put an open mic in front of [him] in that situation". Pacers president [[Donnie Walsh]] later stated that Artest was following advice he had received on how to calm down and avoid trouble in a volatile situation. After unsuccessfully attempting to break up the confrontation, referees prepared to [[ejection (sports)|eject]] various players before the game resumed.{{r|abrams20120229}} Sportscaster [[Mike Breen]], calling the game for ESPN, believed Wallace would be ejected, while [[Bill Walton]] was of the opinion that [[Stephen Jackson]] should be ejected as well, for shouting at the Pistons players and aggravating the situation. However, Breen expressed concern that, if ejected, Wallace would have to walk past the Pacers bench, which could have triggered another incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwvihuoeI8A|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ninety seconds after Wallace shoved Artest, most of both teams' players and coaches were huddled at midcourt, attempting to calm down Wallace{{r|abrams20120229}} ([[Tayshaun Prince]] was the only player on either team to not leave the bench during the entire incident; others became automatically eligible for one-game suspensions).&lt;ref name="mccosky20041129"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2004-11-20-detroit-fans_x.htm|title=Pistons-Pacers brawl spills into the stands|work=USA Today|date=November 20, 2004|accessdate=March 1, 2012|author=McCosky, Chris|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671fyg4Z4?url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2004-11-20-detroit-fans_x.htm|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Artest was lying on the table, Wallace threw a towel at him, causing Artest to briefly stand up before being held back by coaches.{{r|abrams20120229}}{{r|mccosky20041129}} A spectator, John Green, then threw a plastic cup of [[Diet Coke]] at Artest, hitting him in the chest.&lt;ref name="firstreport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4670842|title=Fan details strides made since brawl|date=November 19, 2009|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=November 19, 2009|quote=Green stated he had been drinking beer, but at the time he threw the drink at Artest he was drinking it. 'I remember throwing the cup, actually a cup of beer, but I had been drinking and I've had issues with alcohol in the past.' He later claimed that he had not intended to hit anyone but 'forgot about the laws of physics.'|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671g4Z3tz?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4670842|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artest jumped off the table, ran into the [[bleacher|stands]], and grabbed a man, Michael Ryan, who he mistakenly believed was responsible. Boyle stood up to try and hold back Artest and was trampled in the effort, suffering five fractured vertebrae and a gouge on his head.&lt;ref name="knightridder"/&gt; Jackson followed Artest into the stands and punched a fan, William Paulson, in the face in retaliation for the man throwing another drink in Artest's face while he was being restrained by other spectators.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; Pacers players [[Eddie Gill]], [[David Harrison (basketball)|David Harrison]], [[Reggie Miller]] (who was not dressed for the game due to injury), [[Fred Jones (basketball)|Fred Jones]], and [[Jamaal Tinsley]], the Pistons' [[Rasheed Wallace]], and numerous personnel (including Pistons radio analyst and former player [[Rick Mahorn]]) also quickly entered the stands to retrieve Artest and Jackson, and to break up the fighting. Green punched Artest twice in the head from behind, as did Ben Wallace's brother, David, to Jones.{{r|abrams20120229}} More fans then began throwing drinks and other objects, while a number of fans spilled out onto the court.&lt;ref name="firstreport"/&gt;

As Artest walked out of the stands, he was confronted by two more fans, Alvin "A.J." Shackleford and Charlie Haddad, who ran onto the court.{{r|abrams20120229}} Artest punched Shackleford in the face, causing Haddad to intervene by pushing away Artest, before both fans fell over. While Haddad was on the floor, [[Anthony Johnson (basketball)|Anthony Johnson]] struck him in the back of the head. As Haddad stood up, [[Jermaine O'Neal]] punched him in the jaw after a running start,&lt;ref name="firstreport"/&gt; while slipping in liquid and falling backwards, causing witnesses [[Scot Pollard]], ESPN sideline reporter [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]], and a Pistons executive, Tom Wilson, to briefly fear that O'Neal would kill Haddad. O'Neal later claimed that Haddad had been asked to leave the arena earlier that night, and was well-known to security because of claims that he wanted to fight an NBA player in order to receive compensation. [[William Wesley]], [[Austin Croshere]], and Miller pulled Artest away from the fans,{{r|abrams20120229}} but the scene became chaotic as outnumbered arena security struggled to reestablish order. Although [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]] police had plans to handle many disorders, and had three officers in the arena, they were unprepared for players entering the stands.{{r|abrams20120229}}&lt;ref name="firstreport"/&gt;

Pacers coach [[Rick Carlisle]] said after the game, "I felt like I was fighting for my life out there."  One reporter who attempted to stop Tinsley from entering the stands recalled that the player "went through me like I was butter", and then [[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]], watching the game on TV, recalled that he said, "Holy [''mouths a swear word'']." (O'Neal later said, "As bad as it looked on TV, it was at least 20 times worse in person.") Pacers assistant coach [[Chuck Person]] compared the situation to being "trapped in a gladiator-type scene where the fans were the lions and we were just trying to escape with our lives. That's how it felt. That there was no exit. That you had to fight your way out." Players' children and others in the audience cried from fear and shock. [[Derrick Coleman]] stood near Brown and Brown's [[ball boy]] son to protect them.{{r|abrams20120229}} The remaining seconds of the game were called off and the Pacers were awarded the 97–82 win.&lt;ref name="recap"/&gt; Fans booed the Indiana players as they were escorted from the court by officials and security, and continued to throw beverages and other objects (including a [[folding chair]] that nearly hit O'Neal) at them as they walked under the tunnel to the locker room.{{r|abrams20120229}}&lt;ref name="knightridder"/&gt; A replay on ESPN's broadcast showed Larry Brown attempting to talk to the fans over the loudspeaker of the arena in an attempt to stop the debacle, but Brown threw the microphone down in disgust after the microphone failed to work. No players from either team spoke to the media before leaving the arena. Eventually, police officers were able to swarm the arena, threatening to handcuff those who wouldn't leave.&lt;ref name="knightridder"/&gt; Nine spectators were injured, and two were taken to the hospital.&lt;ref name="indefinitely"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1927663|title=Artest, O'Neal, Jackson, Wallace on hook|date=November 20, 2004|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=May 3, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671gMQKyW?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1927663|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Pacers' locker room, O'Neal and Carlisle nearly got into a fight over the coaches trying to restrain the players when they were defending themselves.{{r|abrams20120229}} Artest asked Jackson whether he thought the players would get in trouble. Jackson responded, "We'll be lucky if we have a freaking job." The conversation convinced an amazed Jackson and Pollard that Artest "wasn't in his right mind, to ask that question".{{r|abrams20120229}}{{r|medina20120926}} Auburn Hills police entered the locker room to make arrests, but the team rushed Artest onto the bus and refused to take him off. The police decided to protect the Pacers as they left the arena and to later contact the team after reviewing game film.{{r|abrams20120229}} Outside of the arena, there were dozens of [[Police car|police cruiser]]s lining the roads out of the parking lots.&lt;ref name="knightridder"/&gt;

===Suspensions===
On November 20, 2004, the NBA suspended Artest, Jackson, O'Neal, and Wallace indefinitely,&lt;ref name="indefinitely"/&gt; saying that their actions were "shocking, repulsive, and inexcusable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/news/commissioner_statement_041120.html|title=Statement from NBA Commissioner David Stern Concerning the Altercation During the Detroit Pistons and Indiana Pacers Game Last Night at The Palace of Auburn Hills|date=November 20, 2004|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|accessdate=May 17, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671gRzjeJ?url=http://www.nba.com/news/commissioner_statement_041120.html|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the NBA announced that nine players would be suspended for a total of what eventually became 146 games–137 games for Pacers players and nine games for Pistons players.&lt;ref name="suspensions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1928540|title=Suspensions without pay, won't be staggered|date=November 21, 2004|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=May 3, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671gZ3vqo?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1928540|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Harrison (basketball)|David Harrison]] was also seen fighting with fans, but the NBA stated that he wouldn't be suspended because "the incident occurred as the players were attempting to leave the floor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1930077|title=Union director suggests 35-game maximum|date=November 28, 2004|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=May 3, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671geT8kp?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1930077|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artest was given the longest suspension; he was suspended for the remainder of the [[2004–05 NBA season]], a suspension that eventually totaled 86&amp;nbsp;games (73 regular season and 13 subsequent playoff games), the [[List of people banned or suspended by the NBA|longest suspension]] for an on-court incident in NBA history.&lt;ref name="suspensions"/&gt; The players suspended also lost in excess of $11&amp;nbsp;million in salary due to the suspensions, with Artest alone losing almost $5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="infamy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/10089645/site/21683474/|title=Palace brawl lives in infamy 1 year later|date=November 26, 2005|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=May 16, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671gn543Q?url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/10089645/site/21683474/|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the week following the announcement of the suspensions, the [[National Basketball Players Association|players' union]] appealed the suspensions of Artest, Jackson, and O'Neal, saying they thought that commissioner Stern had "exceeded his authority".&lt;ref name="suspensions"/&gt; (Jackson felt that despite losing millions the players were fortunate, however, as Stern could have expelled them from the league.{{r|abrams20120229}}) A federal arbitrator upheld the full length of all suspensions, except that of O'Neal, which was reduced to 15 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E3DB1130F930A15751C1A9629C8B63|title=N.B.A. Seeks to Overturn Arbitrator's Shorter Ban for O'Neal|last=Robbins|first=Liz|date=December 23, 2004|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 3, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671ha0Ino?url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E3DB1130F930A15751C1A9629C8B63|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the NBA appealed the decision of the arbitrator to reduce O'Neal's suspension in federal court, and on December 24, a judge issued a temporary injunction allowing O'Neal to play, until a full hearing was held on the NBA's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1952624|title=Final decision expected Dec. 30|date=December 24, 2004|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=May 3, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671hgduwC?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1952624|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Neal played in two more games before the NBA's case was brought before the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York|U.S. District Court]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York on December 30. The NBA argued that under the terms of the [[NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement|Collective Bargaining Agreement]] (CBA), Stern had absolute authority to hand out suspensions and hear appeals for all on-court incidents.

The Pistons won 98–93 without any incidents. Neither Artest nor Jackson played due to their suspensions; O'Neal played in his first game back after the arbitrator reduced his suspension to 15 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=241225011|title=Indiana's O'Neal shows rust in return|date=December 25, 2004|work=ESPN.com|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=May 16, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671kEBS6d?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=241225011|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some NBA teams immediately increased protection of players and arenas, the NFL reminded teams of existing security procedures,{{r|sandoval20041202}} and on February 17, 2005, the NBA imposed new security guidelines for all NBA arenas. The new policies included a size limit of {{convert|24|USoz|ml|0|abbr=on}} for alcohol purchases and a hard cap of two alcoholic beverage purchases for any individual person, as well as a ban of alcohol sales after the end of the third quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1993569|title=Fans subject to conduct code|date=February 17, 2005|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=May 16, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671kJm4h5?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1993569|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also later ordered that each team put at least three security guards between the players and the fans.&lt;ref name="infamy"/&gt;

The Pistons advanced to four straight Eastern Conference Finals after the brawl, and six straight overall, making them the first team since the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in the 1980s to advance to six straight conference finals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280513008|title=Pistons pull away late to advance to 6th straight conference finals|date=May 13, 2008|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=May 17, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671ln9NZl?url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280513008|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they only won the championship once in that streak. However, after losing to the Pistons in the 2005 playoffs, the Pacers failed to finish above .500 until the {{nbay|2011|app=season}} and missed the playoffs for five straight seasons from 2006 through 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/IND/|title=Indiana Pacers|work=basketball-reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Pacers from the 2004–05 season believe that the brawl and its consequences ruined a potential championship team, with Artest as the cause. The Pacers have attempted to rebuild by obtaining "character guys" as players.{{r|abrams20120229}}

On November 19, 2009, John Green, one of the fans who helped begin the brawl, appeared on ''[[First Take (TV series)|ESPN First Take]]'', where he talked about the incident and the changes he had made since then. Green recounted that he had an alcohol problem at the time and had since made an effort to deal with that. He also said that Ron Artest had apologized to him several months earlier, and wished to work together in some type of community service in Detroit.&lt;ref name="John Green"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19167">'''Quantum neural networks''' ('''QNNs''') are [[neural network models]] which are based on the principles of [[quantum mechanics]].  There are two different approaches to QNN research, one exploiting [[quantum information]] processing to improve existing neural network models (sometimes also vice versa), and the other one searching for potential [[quantum effect]]s in the brain.

== Artificial quantum neural networks ==

In the computational approach to quantum neural network research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=da Silva|first1=Adenilton J.|last2=Ludermir|first2=Teresa B.|last3=de Oliveira|first3=Wilson R.|title=Quantum perceptron over a field and neural network architecture selection in a quantum computer|journal=Neural Networks|volume=76|pages=55–64|doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2016.01.002|arxiv=1602.00709}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panella|first1=Massimo|last2=Martinelli|first2=Giuseppe|title=Neural networks with quantum architecture and quantum learning|journal=International Journal of Circuit Theory and Applications|volume=39|pages=61–77|doi=10.1002/cta.619}}&lt;/ref&gt; scientists try to combine [[artificial neural network]] models (which are widely used in machine learning for the important task of pattern classification) with the advantages of [[quantum information]] in order to develop more efficient algorithms (for a review, see &lt;ref&gt;M. Schuld, I. Sinayskiy, F. Petruccione: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.7005 The quest for a Quantum Neural Network], Quantum Information Processing 13, 11, pp. 2567-2586 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;). One important motivation for these investigations is the difficulty to train classical neural networks, especially in [[Big data|big data applications]]. The hope is that features of [[quantum computing]] such as [[quantum parallelism]] or the effects of [[quantum interference|interference]] and [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] can be used as resources. Since the technological implementation of a quantum computer is still in a premature stage, such quantum neural network models are mostly theoretical proposals that await their full implementation in physical experiments.

Quantum neural network research is still in its infancy, and a conglomeration of proposals and ideas of varying scope and mathematical rigor have been put forward. Most of them are based on the idea of replacing classical binary or [[McCulloch-Pitts neuron]]s with a [[qubit]] (which can be called a “quron”), resulting in neural units that can be in a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of the state ‘firing’ and ‘resting’.

=== Historical notion ===

The first ideas on quantum neural computation were published independently in 1995 by Ron Chrisley&lt;ref&gt;R. Chrisley, [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ron_Chrisley/publication/305848278_Quantum_Learning/links/57a3736408aefe6167a5cf5c/Quantum-Learning.pdf Quantum Learning], In &lt;I&gt;New directions in cognitive science: Proceedings of the international symposium,
Saariselka, 4-9 August 1995, Lapland, Finland&lt;/I&gt;, P. Pylkkänen and P. Pylkkö (editors). Finnish Association of
Artificial Intelligence, Helsinki, 77-89 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and
[[Subhash Kak]]&lt;ref&gt;S. Kak, [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Subhash_Kak/publication/220313905_On_Quantum_Neural_Computing/links/56644e2d08ae192bbf9085b7.pdf On quantum neural computing], Advances in Imaging and Electron Physics 94, 259 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;.  Kak discussed the similarity of the neural activation function with the quantum mechanical [[Eigenvalue equation]], and later discussed the application of these ideas to the study of brain function&lt;ref&gt;S. Kak, [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Subhash_Kak/publication/2643351_The_Three_Languages_Of_The_Brain_Quantum_Reorganizational_And_Associative/links/56644e3c08ae418a786d4907.pdf The three languages of the brain: quantum, reorganizational, and associative]. In Learning as Self- Organization, K. Pribram and J. King (editors). Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ, 185-219 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and the limitations of this approach.&lt;ref&gt;A. Gautam and S. Kak, Symbols, meaning, and origins of mind. Biosemiotics (Springer Verlag) 6: 301-310 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Ajit Narayanan and Tammy Menneer proposed a photonic implementation of a quantum neural network model that is based on the many-universe theory and “collapses” into the desired model upon measurement.&lt;ref&gt;A. Narayanan and T. Menneer: [https://www.academia.edu/download/46514893/s0020-0255_2800_2900055-420160615-28135-12ijr97.pdf Quantum artificial neural network architectures and components]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Information Sciences 128, 231-255 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, more and more articles have been published in journals of computer science as well as quantum physics in order to find a superior quantum neural network model.

=== Quantum perceptrons ===

A lot of proposals attempt to find a quantum equivalent for the [[perceptron]] unit from which neural nets are constructed. A problem is that nonlinear activation functions do not immediately correspond to the mathematical structure of quantum theory, since a quantum evolution is described by linear operations and leads to probabilistic observation. Ideas to imitate the perceptron activation function with a quantum mechanical formalism reach from special measurements &lt;ref&gt;M. Perus: [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f8de/ca83367163b78d8f2cfb433d408060e8b995.pdf Neural Networks as a basis for quantum associative memory], Neural Network World 10 (6), 1001 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Zak, C.P. Williams: Quantum Neural Nets, International Journal of Theoretical Physics 37(2), 651 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; to postulating non-linear quantum operators (a mathematical framework that is disputed).&lt;ref&gt;S. Gupta, R. Zia: [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000001917696 Quantum Neural Networks], Journal of Computer and System Sciences 63(3), 355 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Faber, G.A. Giraldi: Quantum Models for Artificial Neural Network (2002), Electronically available: http://arquivosweb.{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} lncc.br/pdfs/QNN-Review. pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A direct implementation of the activation function using the [[quantum circuit|circuit-based model of quantum computation]] has recently been proposed by Schuld, Sinayskiy and Petruccione based on the [[quantum phase estimation algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Schuld, I. Sinayskiy, F. Petruccione: Simulating a perceptron on a quantum computer [https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3635 ArXiv:1412.3635] (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fuzzy logic ===

A substantial amount of interest has been given to a “quantum-inspired” model that uses ideas from quantum theory to implement a neural network based on fuzzy logic.&lt;ref&gt;G. Purushothaman, N. Karayiannis: [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fe11/93d386f42358e7cf9b1f71bf33e7ddd945b5.pdf Quantum Neural Networks (QNN’s): Inherently Fuzzy Feedforward Neural Networks], IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 8(3), 679 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantum networks ===

Some contributions reverse the approach and try to exploit the insights from neural network research in order to obtain powerful applications for quantum computing, such as quantum algorithmic design supported by machine learning.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bang et al. : [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/16/7/073017 A strategy for quantum algorithm design assisted by machine learning], New Journal of Physics 16 073017 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the work of Elizabeth Behrman and Jim Steck,&lt;ref&gt;E.C. Behrman, J.E. Steck, P. Kumar, K.A. Walsh: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.1558 Quantum Algorithm design using dynamic learning], Quantum Information and Computation, vol. 8, No. 1&amp;2, pp. 12-29 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; who propose a quantum computing setup that consists of a number of [[qubits]] with tunable mutual interactions. Following the classical [[backpropagation]] rule, the strength of the  interactions are learned from a [[training set]] of desired input-output relations, and the quantum network thus ‘learns’ an algorithm.

=== Quantum associative memory ===

The quantum associative memory algorithm &lt;ref&gt;D. Ventura, T. Martinez: [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d46f/e04b57b75a7f9c57f25d03d1c56b480ab755.pdf A quantum associative memory based on Grover's algorithm], Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks and Genetics Algorithms, pp. 22-27 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; has been introduced by Dan Ventura and Tony Martinez in 1999. The authors do not attempt to translate the structure of artificial neural network models into quantum theory, but propose an algorithm for a [[quantum circuit|circuit-based quantum computer]] that simulates [[associative memory (psychology)|associative memory]]. The memory states (in [[Hopfield neural network]]s saved in the weights of the neural connections) are written into a superposition, and a [[Grover search algorithm|Grover-like quantum search algorithm]] retrieves the memory state closest to a given input. An advantage lies in the exponential storage capacity of memory states, however the question remains whether the model has significance regarding the initial purpose of Hopfield models as a demonstration of how simplified artificial neural networks can simulate features of the brain.

=== Quantum computing via Sparse Distributed Representations ===

Rinkus &lt;ref&gt;G. Rinkus (2102): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05660 Quantum Computation via Sparse Distributed Representation]. Neuroquantology 10(2) 311-315&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that distributed representation, specifically ''sparse distributed representation'' (SDR), provides a classical implementation of quantum computing.  Specifically, the set of SDR codes stored in an SDR coding field will generally intersect with each other to varying degrees. In other work,&lt;ref&gt;G. Rinkus (1996): A Combinatorial Neural Network Exhibiting Episodic and Semantic Memory Properties for Spatio-Temporal Patterns. Doctoral Thesis. Boston University. Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Rinkus (2010): [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2889687/ A cortical sparse distributed coding model linking mini- and macrocolumn-scale functionality]. Frontiers in Neuroanatomy 4:17&lt;/ref&gt; Rinkus describes a fixed time learning (and inference) algorithm that preserves similarity in the input space into similarity (intersection size) in the SDR code space. Assuming that input similarity correlates with probability, this means that any '''single''' active SDR code is also a probability distribution over '''all''' stored inputs, with the probability of each input measured by the fraction of its SDR code that is active (i.e., the size of its intersection with the active SDR code).  The learning/inference algorithm can also be viewed as a state update operator and because any single active SDR simultaneously represents both the probability of the single input, X, to which it was assigned during learning '''and''' the probabilities of '''all''' other stored inputs, the same physical process that updates the probability of X also updates '''all''' stored probabilities.  By 'fixed time', it is meant that the number of computational steps comprising this process (the update algorithm) remains constant as the number of stored codes increases. This theory departs radically from the standard view of quantum computing and quantum physical theory more generally: rather than assuming that the states of the lowest level entities in the system, i.e., single binary neurons, exist in superposition, it assumes only that higher-level, i.e., composite entities, i.e., whole SDR codes (which are sets of binary neurons), exist in superposition.

=== Quantum learning ===

Most learning algorithms follow the classical model of training an artificial neural network to learn the input-output function of a given [[training set]] and use classical feedback loops to update parameters of the quantum system until they converge to an optimal configuration. Learning as a parameter optimisation problem has also been approached by adiabatic models of quantum computing.&lt;ref&gt;H. Neven et al.: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.0416 Training a Binary Classifier with the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm], arXiv:0811.0416v1 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Recently there has been proposed a new post-learning strategy to allow the search for improved set of weights based on analogy with quantum effects occurring in nature. The technique, proposed in &lt;ref&gt;Kapanova, K. G., I. Dimov, and J. M. Sellier. "[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.08366 On randomization of neural networks as a form of post-learning strategy]." arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.08366 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the analogy of modeling a biological neuron as a semiconductor heterostructure consisting of one energetic barrier sandwiched between two energetically lower areas. The activation function of the neuron is therefore considered as a particle entering the heterostructure and interacting with the barrier. In this way auxiliary reinforcement to the classical learning process of neural networks is achieved with minimal additional computational costs.

=== Quantum Generalisations of Feedforward Neural Networks &lt;ref name="WanDKGK16"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Dahlsten|first2=Oscar|last3=Kristjansson|first3=Hler|last4=Gardner|first4=Robert|last5=Kim|first5=Myungshik|year=2016|title=Quantum generalisation of feedforward neural networks|doi=10.1038/s41534-017-0032-4|journal=|volume=|issue=|pages=|arxiv=1612.01045|bibcode=2017npjQI...3...36W|last1=Wan|first1=Kwok-Ho}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
One way of constructing a quantum neuron is to first generalise classical neurons (by padding of ancillary bits) to reversible permutation gates and then generalising them further to make unitary gates. Due to the [[no-cloning theorem]]  in quantum mechanics, the copying of the output before sending it to several neurons in the next layer is non-trivial. This can be replaced with a general quantum unitary acting on the output plus a dummy bit in state {{braket|ket|0}}. That has the classical copying gate ([[Controlled NOT gate|CNOT]] ) as a special case, and in that sense generalises the classical copying operation. It can be demonstrated that in this scheme, the quantum neural networks can: (i) compress quantum states onto a minimal number of qubits, creating a quantum autoencoder, and (ii) discover quantum communication protocols such as [[Quantum teleportation|teleportation]]. The general recipe is theoretical and implementation-independent. The quantum neuron module can naturally be implemented [[Integrated quantum photonics|photonically]].&lt;ref name="WanDKGK16" /&gt;

== Biological quantum neural networks ==

Although many quantum neural network researchers explicitly limit their scope to a computational perspective, the field is closely connected to investigations of potential quantum effects in biological neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;W. Loewenstein: [https://books.google.com/books?id=d3jD2685IBMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Physics in mind. A quantum view of the brain], Basic Books (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Stapp: [https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:40070340 Mind Matter and Quantum Mechanics], Springer, Heidelberg (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Models of cognitive agents and memory based on quantum collectives have been proposed by Subhash Kak,&lt;ref&gt;Kak, S. [http://neuroquantology.com/index.php/journal/article/viewFile/682/603 Biological memories and agents as quantum collectives]. NeuroQuantology 11: 391-398     (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; but he also points to specific problems of limits on observation and control of these memories due to fundamental logical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Kak, S. Observability and computability in physics, Quantum Matter 3: 172-176 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; He has also proposed that a quantum language must be associated with biological neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;Kak, S. (2016). Communication languages and agents in biological systems. In: ''Biocommunication: Sign-Mediated Interactions between Cells and Organisms''. Eds.: J. Seckbach &amp; R. Gordon. London, World Scientific Publishing: 203-226&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of quantum physics and neuroscience also nourishes a vivid debate beyond the borders of science, an illustrative example being journals such as NeuroQuantology &lt;ref&gt;http://www.neuroquantology.com/index.php/journal&lt;/ref&gt; or the healing method of Quantum Neurology.&lt;ref&gt;http://quantumneurology.com/&lt;/ref&gt; However, also in the scientific sphere theories of how the brain might harvest the behavior of particles on a quantum level are controversially debated.&lt;ref&gt;S. Hameroff: [http://quantumconsciousness.org/sites/default/files/hameroff-1998.pdf Quantum computation in brain microtubules? The Penrose-Hameroff 'Orch-OR' model of consciousness], Philosophical Transactions Royal Society of London Series A, 356 1743 1869 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Pessa, G. Vitiello: Bioelectrochemistry and Bioenergetics, 48 2 339 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The fusion of biology and quantum physics recently gained momentum by the discovery of signs for [[Quantum biology|efficient energy transport in photosynthesis due to quantum effects]]. However, there is no widely accepted evidence for the ‘quantum brain’ yet but anecdotal reports of "Mag-Lag" effects in MRI scanner patients could tentatively suggest that the quite delicate interactions in the brain may be quantum in nature, and thus can be influenced by very strong steady state magnetic fields coincidentally resembling the effects seen at high-G in fighter pilots. This hypothesis is now being tested further.

==Black holes==

A 2018 paper by [[Giorgi Dvali]] proposed that a [[black hole]] can be modeled as a particular type of QNN, and that black holes and brains may store memories in similar ways. &lt;ref name=“Dvali”&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.03918.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robbie Nell Tilley Branscum''' (June 17, 1934 – May 24, 1997) was an American writer of [[children's books]] and [[young adult fiction]]. Her books were awarded with a Friends of American Writers Award (1977) and an [[Edgar Award]] (1983).&lt;ref name="News-Record"&gt;"Obituary - Robbie Branscum", ''Daily News-Record'', [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]], May 31, 1997, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Arkansas"&gt;{{cite web

Robbie was born on a farm near [[Big Flat, Arkansas]]. Her father died when she was only four years old and she grew up with her poor grandparents on another farm. Branscum dropped out from school after the seventh grade. She continued to read books and write poetry and songs&lt;ref name="something"&gt;{{cite web |title= Robbie Branscum Papers |author=Nancy Larsen |publisher=University of Minnesota Libraries Children's Literature Research Collections |url=http://special.lib.umn.edu/findaid/xml/CLRC-1224.xml}} citing {{cite book |title=Something about the author |volume=72 |pages=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided for her livelihood through work at dirt farms.&lt;ref name="News-Record"/&gt; At the age of 15 she married Dwane Branscum. She gave birth to a daughter and divorced at the age of 25.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Arkansas"/&gt;

Her life took a major turn after the newsletter of her church, the [[Southern Baptist]], printed an article she had written. Subsequently she decided to become an author. Her first book was ''Me and Jim Luke'' (1971). Branscum published 20 books in 20 years time, though not one each year. Several of her books were translated into Danish, Italian, Japanese, and Swedish. Branscum worked with [[literary agent]] [[Barthold Fles]].&lt;ref&gt;Branscum R: "Cheater and Flitter Dick". [[Viking Press]], 1983&lt;/ref&gt; She died from a heart attack in 1997 in her home in [[San Pablo, California]].&lt;ref name="News-Record"/&gt;

'''Rogvolod''' ({{lang-ru|Рогволод|translit=Rogvolod}}; {{lang-be|Рагвалод|translit=Rahvałod}}) (c. 920 – 978) was first chronicled prince of [[Principality of Polatsk|Polatsk]] (945–978). In the [[Russian Primary Chronicle]], he is known as Рогъволодъ, probably a slavicized version of the [[Old Norse]] name ''[[Rognvald|Ragnvald]]''. He came from overseas (i.e., from [[Scandinavia]] or [[Wends|Southern Baltic]]) and established himself at [[Polatsk]] in the mid-10th century.  According to the Russian Primary Chronicle, [[Vladimir the Great]] sought an alliance with him in 980 by marrying his daughter [[Rogneda]], but she insultingly refused, prompting Vladimir to attack Rogvolod and his sons and kill them, after which he forcibly took Rogneda as his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Martin, ''Medieval Russia 980-1584'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Room 8''' (1947–1968) was a neighborhood [[cat]] who wandered into a classroom in 1952 at Elysian Heights Elementary School in [[Echo Park, California]]. He lived in the school during the school year and then disappeared for the summer, returning when classes started again.  This pattern continued without interruption until the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="ehc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explorehistoricalif.com/ehc_legacy/room8.html|title=Room 8, The Most Famous Cat in Los Angeles|last=Vargo|first=Roger|date=May 2008|website=Explore Historic California|publisher=Explore Historic California|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527012147/http://www.explorehistoricalif.com/room8.html|archivedate=2008-05-27|deadurl=no|accessdate=2008-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News cameras would arrive at the school at the beginning of the year waiting for the cat's return; he became famous and would receive up to 100 letters a day addressed to him at the school. Eventually, he was featured in a documentary called ''Big Cat, Little Cat'' and a children's book, ''A Cat Called Room 8''. ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine ran a three-page Room 8 feature by photographer Richard Hewett in November 1962, titled "Room 8: The School Cat". [[Leo Kottke]] wrote an instrumental called "Room 8" that was included in his 1971 album, ''[[Mudlark (album)|Mudlark]]''.&lt;ref name="ehc2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explorehistoricalif.com/ehc_legacy/room8.html|title=Room 8, The Most Famous Cat in Los Angeles, Page 2|last=Vargo|first=Roger|date=May 2008|website=Explore Historic California|publisher=Explore Historic California|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As he got older, Room 8 was injured in a cat fight and suffered from [[Pneumonia (non-human)|feline pneumonia]], so a family near the school volunteered to take him in. The school's janitor would find him at the end of the school day and carry him across the street.

His [[obituary]] in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' rivaled that of major political figures, running three columns with a photograph. The cat was so famous that his obituary ran in papers as far away as [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. The students raised the funds for his gravestone.&lt;ref name="ehc" /&gt;  He is buried at the [[Los Angeles Pet Memorial Park]] in [[Calabasas, California]].

Elysian Heights Elementary School has a wall mural on the outside of the school that features Room 8, and the teachers read his book to each new class.  Room 8's paw prints are immortalized in cement on the sidewalk outside the school.

In 1972, a cat shelter was started in his name called [http://www.room8cats.org/ The Room 8 Memorial Foundation].

'''SAI Global''' is a [[risk management]], [[standards compliance]] and information business.  It was floated on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] on 17 December 2003, with the initial shareholding 40% retained by parent organisation [[Standards Australia]] having been progressively sold down to zero. It was part of the [[ASX 200]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asx200list.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

SAI Global provides a [[commercial database]] of [[Australian standards]], called "SAI Global - Standards Online", including drafts and auxiliary material, which is available in many Australian libraries.

The company also administers the Australian Business Excellence Awards which are the [[List of national quality awards|national quality awards]] of Australia.&lt;REF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saiglobal.com/ProfessionalServices/Awards/|title=Australian Business Excellence Awards|accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/REF&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4289">'''SERENDIP''' ('''Search for Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations''') is a [[Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence]] (SETI) program originated by the [[Berkeley SETI Research Center]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="SERENDIP"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://seti.ssl.berkeley.edu/serendip/ | title = SERENDIP | publisher = [[UC Berkeley]] | accessdate = 2006-08-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130311222213/http://seti.ssl.berkeley.edu/serendip | archivedate = 2013-03-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SERENDIP takes advantage of ongoing "mainstream" [[radio telescope]] observations as a "[[wikt:piggybacking|piggy-back]]" or "[[commensal]]" program. Rather than having its own observation program, SERENDIP analyzes [[Deep Sky|deep space]] radio telescope data that it obtains while other [[astronomer]]s are using the telescope.

==Background==
The initial SERENDIP instrument was a 100-channel [[analog transmission|analog]] radio [[spectrometer]] covering 100&amp;nbsp;[[kHz]] of [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. Subsequent instruments have been significantly more capable, with the number of channels doubling roughly every year. These instruments have been deployed at a large number of telescopes including the NRAO 90m telescope at Green Bank and the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo 305m telescope]].

SERENDIP observations have been conducted at frequencies between 400 [[MHz]] and 5 [[GHz]], with most observations near the so-called Cosmic [[waterhole (radio)|Water Hole]] (1.42&amp;nbsp;GHz (21&amp;nbsp;cm) neutral [[hydrogen]] and 1.66&amp;nbsp;GHz [[hydroxyl]] transitions).

==Projects==
The most recently deployed SERENDIP spectrometer, SERENDIP V.v, was installed at the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in June 2009 and is currently operational. The digital back-end instrument is an [[FPGA]]-based 128 million-channel digital spectrometer covering 200&amp;nbsp;MHz of bandwidth.  It takes data commensally with the seven-beam Arecibo L-band Feed Array&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naic.edu/alfa/&lt;/ref&gt; (ALFA).

The next generation of SERENDIP experiments, SERENDIP VI was deployed in 2014 at both [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]] and the [[Green Bank Telescope]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lebofsky|first1=Matt|title=SETI@Home Mid June Update|url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/forum_thread.php?id=77575|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; SERENDIP VI will also look for fast radio bursts, in collaboration with scientists from [[University of Oxford]] and [[West Virginia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winter 2013 SETI@home Letter|url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/donor_letter_nov13.php|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Findings==
The program has found around 400 suspicious signals, but there is not enough data to prove that they belong to [[extraterrestrial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lnfm1.sai.msu.ru/SETI/koi/articles/lmg%20seti%20poisk/1.9.htm Л.М.Гиндилис. Радиопоиск: век двадцатый]&lt;/ref&gt; The most interesting [[Wow! signal|signal «Wow!»]] was recorded in August 1977 but it was observed for only a very short time and disappeared before it had been identified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intellect-video.com/1437/Gordon-Poisk-vnezemnykh-tsivilizatsiy-online/ В.Г.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8499">'''Silent birth''', sometimes known as '''quiet birth''', is a birthing procedure advised by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and advocated by [[Scientology|Scientologists]] in which "everyone attending the birth should refrain from spoken words as much as possible" and where "... chatty doctors and nurses, shouts to 'PUSH, PUSH' and loud or laughing remarks to 'encourage' are avoided".&lt;ref name="CoSFAQ"&gt;{{cite web | last = Church of Scientology | year = 2006 | url = http://www.scientology.org/html/en_US/news-media/index.html | title = Scientology Newsroom | accessdate = 2006-08-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060813105405/http://www.scientology.org/html/en_US/news-media/index.html | archivedate = 2006-08-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scientology doctrine, this is because "any words spoken are recorded in the [[reactive mind]] and can have an aberrative effect on the mother and the child."&lt;ref name="CoSFAQ" /&gt; Hubbard believed that breaking the silence during childbirth with words could adversely affect the child later in life. Church members believe that noises, sounds and words while a child is being born can possibly cause trauma, which in turn causes the production of [[Engram (Dianetics)|engrams]], thus necessitating silent birth. Scientologists believe that it is also a way to assist a newborn in his or her development spiritually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashcraft-Eason |first1=Lillian |last2=Martin |first2=Darnise C. |last3=Olademo |first3=Overonke |title=Women and New African Religions |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2010 |isbn=9780275991562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of silent birth is a mandatory practice in Scientology doctrine. It is based upon the principle that expectant mothers must be provided the utmost care and respect and Hubbard’s words: "Everyone must learn to say nothing within the expectant mother’s hearing using labor and delivery. Particularly during birth, absolute silence must be maintained and the more gentle the delivery, the better.” Silent birth is meant to make the transition to physical separation from the mother less painful for the child. The church does not rule against medication and caesarean section births.&lt;ref name="Pande"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Pande |first=Navodita |editor-last=Sange |editor-first=Mary Zeiss |editor2-last=Oyster |editor2-first=Carol K. |encyclopedia=The Multimedia Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World |title=Silent Birth (Scientology) |date=2016-05-01 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |doi=10.4135/9781452270388.n385 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been no attempts to prove this medically or scientifically and&lt;ref name="WebMD" /&gt; the church does not claim silent birth as a medical approach but a religious and philosophical one.&lt;ref name="Pande" /&gt;

==Scientific opinion==
The efficacy of silent birth has been questioned by a number of doctors and other health care professionals. Patricia Devine, MD, a maternal–fetal medicine specialist who directs the [[Labor and Delivery]] Unit at [[Columbia University Medical Center]], said, "There's absolutely no scientific evidence that taking [noise] away at the time of delivery will have any effect on outcome for the baby or mother."&lt;ref name="WebMD"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shaw|first=Gina | year=2006 | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,191731,00.html | dead-url=yes | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071230061118/https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,191731,00.html | archivedate=2007-12-30 | title=Doctors Sound Off About TomKat 'Silent Birth' Plan | publisher=WebMD | accessdate = 2006-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked whether there was any medical evidence that indicated that silent birth was beneficial, Damian Alagia, MD, associate clinical professor in the department of [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]] at [[George Washington University|George Washington University Medical Center]], replied, "It may be in the Scientology literature, but it's not in the scientific literature. In my understanding, L. Ron Hubbard never spent any time in medical school, studying [[pediatrics]] or studying [[infant|neonatal]] development. To think that a baby born in silence is going to do any better than a baby born, say, listening to [[Hank Williams]] is just foolhardy."&lt;ref name="WebMD" /&gt;

==Ray and Louise Spiering==
In 2004, Scientologists Ray and Louise Spiering went to federal court to argue that Nebraska's mandatory blood test for infants would violate their right to practice the "Silent Birth Method" of their religion. According to the lawsuit "every effort should be made to avoid subjecting the baby to loud sounds, talking, stress or pain during the first seven days of the baby's life ... Because a baby goes through so much pain during the birth process, Scientologists believe that a newborn baby should not be subjected to any further pain or significant sensory experiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cooper |first1=Todd |title=Blood test for newborns faces religious challenge |url=https://culteducation.com/group/1284-scientology/25312-blood-test-for-newborns-faces-religious-challenge.html |accessdate=5 October 2018 |work=Omaha World-Herald |date=21 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Katie Holmes==
The "silent birth" became an object of media interest when it was known that outspoken Scientologist actor [[Tom Cruise]], and wife [[Katie Holmes]] who converted to Scientology from Roman Catholicism, were expecting a child. Reports that the couple would follow the practice of silent birth were denied, until photos were taken of large placards being delivered to the couple's mansion bearing instructions for the silent birth, such as "Be silent and make all physical movements slow and understandable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Reuters |year=2006 |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12211173/ |title= Giddy romance leading Holmes to silent birth: Scientologists believe baby can remember traumatic experiences |accessdate=2006-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was often reported in the media during this time that speaking to the infant during the first week of its life was barred by Scientology doctrine as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = MSNBC|year=2006 |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9620245/ |title= Silent Scientology birth for Tom and Katie?: Group's birth principles call for no music or talking during labor |accessdate=2006-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Church spokesperson termed this "a total fabrication." The Church of Scientology International writes, "L. Ron Hubbard never wrote that parents should not speak to their child for seven days following birth."&lt;ref name="SilentBirthDotOrg"&gt;{{cite web|author = Church of Scientology International |year=2006 |url= http://www.silentbirth.org/ |title= All About Silent Birth |accessdate=2006-05-01 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same website also says "[t]he idea of silent birth is based on L. Ron Hubbard’s research into the mind and spirit. He found that words spoken during moments of pain and unconsciousness can have adverse effects on an individual later in life."&lt;ref name="SilentBirthDotOrg"/&gt; The website also says "[m]others naturally want to give their baby the best possible start in life and thus keep the birth as quiet as possible."&lt;ref name="SilentBirthDotOrg"/&gt;

Since the launch of the Doe Network, over 600 people have volunteered.&lt;ref name=match/&gt; Members are selected after applications are submitted and background information is confirmed. A core team organizes information that is published on the Web site, compiling approved information received from other members.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

==History==

The Doe Network was created in 1999 by Jennifer Marra of Michigan &lt;ref name="Birkbeck2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matt Birkbeck|title=A Beautiful Child: A True Story of Hope, Horror, and an Enduring Human Spirit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eUc43ZLd3dUC|year=2005|publisher=Berkley Books|isbn=978-0-425-20440-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a Web site database for international long-term missing persons and unidentified victims. Marra turned control of the site over to Helene Wahlstrom of Sweden in 2001.&lt;ref name="Birkbeck2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matt Birkbeck|title=A Beautiful Child: A True Story of Hope, Horror, and an Enduring Human Spirit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eUc43ZLd3dUC|year=2005|publisher=Berkley Books|isbn=978-0-425-20440-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wahlstrom then joined forces with the Cold Cases Yahoo! group headed by Todd Matthews of Tennessee, thereby creating the volunteer group aimed at finding potential  matches between missing persons and unidentified victims. &lt;ref name=restore&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Neil|first1=Helen|title=Amateur sleuths restore identity to the dead|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Amateur-sleuths-restore-identity-to-the-dead-3219899.php|accessdate=23 July 2015|work=Seatle Pi|date=30 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clayton|first1=Robin|title=Cold cases remembered|work=ACO News|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singleton|first1=David|title=Grim discovery of bones cause for hope, despair|url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/grim-discovery-of-bones-cause-for-hope-despair-1.729383#axzz1QKo0qxnn|accessdate=23 July 2015|work=The Times Tribune|date=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Melvin|first1=Joshua|title=The John Doe files: San Mateo County coroner tries to name unidentified bodies|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/san-mateo-county/ci_18357956|accessdate=22 July 2015|work=San Jose Mercury News|date=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|last1=Griffin|first1=Drew|title=Security Watch'; The Doe Network|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0506/07/lol.01.html|accessdate=22 July 2015|work=CNN News|agency=CNN|date=7 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthews had assisted in the identification of [[Barbara Ann Hackmann Taylor]], previously nicknamed as "Tent Girl," in 1998, which had inspired him to create a website to help solve similar cases.&lt;ref name=match/&gt;&lt;ref name=assisted/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walton|first1=Pamela|title=Lost and Found in the Cumberland|work=Celebrations Magazine|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthews also co-founded a different organization, known as Project EDAN (Everyone Deserves a Name), which consists of a group of forensic artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Carol|title='Tent Girl' and the start of the Doe Network|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Tent-Girl-and-the-start-of-the-Doe-Network-1184519.php|accessdate=23 July 2015|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|publisher=Seattle Pi|date=5 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This page is a '''timeline of [[senescence]] research''', including major theories, breakthroughs and organizations. "Senescence" here refers to "Ageing" rather than the phenomena of [[cellular senescence]], which is a change in cell state associated with ageing, cancer prevention, wound healing, regeneration and embryonic/placenta development.

| c. 99 BC – c. 55 BC|| Theory || Roman poet and philosopher [[Lucretius]] argues that aging and death are beneficial because they make room for the next generation.

| 1891 || Theory || [[August Weismann]] proposes the first formal programmed aging theory as an evolutionary explanation of aging driven by group selection.

| 1952 || Theory || [[Peter Medawar]] formulates the first modern theory of mammal aging, known as ''[[mutation accumulation]]'', whereby the mechanism of action involves random, detrimental ''germline'' mutations of a kind that happen to show their effect only late in life.&lt;ref name=the-evolution-of-aging/&gt; ||
|-
| 1957 || Theory|| [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] proposes the today called ''[[antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis]]'' (AP) for the evolution of aging.  It occurs when one gene controls for more than one phenotypic trait where at least one of these is beneficial to the organism's fitness and at least one is detrimental, thus accumulating damage.&lt;ref name=the-evolution-of-aging/&gt;&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2406060|author=Williams, G.C.|title=Pleiotropy, natural selection and the evolution of senescence|journal=Evolution|volume=11|issue=4|pages=398–411|year=1957|format=PDF|url=http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf|jstor=2406060|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713071204/http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf|archivedate=2006-07-13|df=}} Paper in which Williams describes his theory of antagonistic pleiotropy.&lt;/ref&gt; ||

'''Well-being''', '''wellbeing''', or '''wellness''' is the condition of an individual or group. A high level of well-being means that in some sense the individual's or group's condition is positive.

==Multiple factors==
According to Naci and Ioannidis,
{{quote|Wellness refers to diverse and interconnected dimensions of [[Physical fitness|physical]], mental, and social well-being that extend beyond the traditional definition of [[health]]. It includes choices and activities aimed at achieving physical vitality, mental alacrity, social satisfaction, a sense of accomplishment, and personal fulfillment.&lt;ref name=JAMA&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Huseyin Naci; John P. A. Ioannidis,|title=Evaluation of Wellness Determinants and Interventions by Citizen Scientists|journal=JAMA|date=June 11, 2015|doi=10.1001/jama.2015.6160|volume=314|pages=121|pmid=26068643}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Barry Kaufman]] sees [[well-being]] as influenced by [[happiness]] and meaning. https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-differences-between-happiness-and-meaning-in-life/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Philosophical approaches==

''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (''SEP'') entry for "well-being" identifies ways in which terms related to [[happiness]] differ. According to the ''SEP'', the terms "happy", "wellness", "satisfaction", "pleasure" or "well-being" can refer to a series of possible states:
* reflection on past events
* moment-to-moment evaluations of happiness
* by oneself, or with another person
* inferred from neuroimaging
* inferred from sensory input (pain, pleasure)
* inferred from cognitive structure (dysfunctional thinking, delusion)
* inferred from virtue (is prayer inherently instrumental to well-being?)
* duration of the experience
* effect on other factors (e.g., personal agency, power)
* repetitiveness (is pleasure derived from addiction incompatible with happiness?)
* objectivity (is "healthy eating" or "sex" always pleasurable?)
* whether the experience is altruistic or egoistic, 
*whether happiness reflects an emotional state (affect-based account)
* whether happiness reflects a cognitive judgement (life satisfaction account)

The affective and life-satisfaction views of happiness differ meaningfully when it comes to certain topics such as the relationship between income and happiness:

"''Surveying large numbers of Americans in one case, and what is claimed to be the first globally representative sample of humanity in the other, these studies found that income does indeed correlate substantially (.44 in the global sample), at all levels, with life satisfaction—strictly speaking, a “life evaluation” measure that asks respondents to rate their lives without saying whether they are satisfied. Yet the correlation of household income with the affect measures is far weaker: globally, .17 for positive affect, –.09 for negative affect; and in the United States, essentially zero above $75,000 (though quite strong at low income levels). If the results hold up, the upshot appears to be that income is pretty strongly related to life satisfaction, but weakly related to emotional well-being, at least above a certain threshold.''"&lt;ref&gt;Section 3.3 https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/happiness/#HedVerEmoSta&lt;/ref&gt;

There are weaknesses to the self-report method of elicitation for happiness: The lay conception of emotions (affect) is that they are discrete. It is typical, in everyday language, just as in research, to use research protocols that accept answers such as: "I am happy or I am sad, but not both simultaneously", or "I am 7 on a 1-10 scale of happiness (likert)".

==Scientific approaches==
Three subdisciplines in psychology are critical for the study of psychological well-being:&lt;ref name="ryff1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryff|first=Carol D.|title=Happiness is everything, or is it? Explorations on the meaning of psychological well-being.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1989|volume=57|issue=6|pages=1069–1081|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.57.6.1069}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Developmental psychology, in which psychological well-being may be analyzed in terms of a pattern of growth across the lifespan.
# Personality psychology, in which it is possible to apply Maslow's concept of self-actualization, Rogers' concept of the fully functioning person, Jung's concept of individuation, and Allport's concept of maturity to account for psychological well-being.&lt;ref name="ryff2"/&gt;
# Clinical psychology, in which it may be asserted that the absence of mental illness constitutes psychological well-being.

There are two approaches typically taken to understand psychological well-being:
# Distinguishing positive and negative effects, and defining optimal psychological well-being and happiness as a balance between the two.
# Emphasizes [[life satisfaction]] as the key indicator of psychological well-being.&lt;ref name="ryff2"&gt;Ryff, C. D., &amp; Keyes, C. M. (1995). The structure of psychological well-being revisited. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 69(4), 719–727.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Guttman and Levy (1982) well-being is "...a special case of attitude".&lt;ref name="Guttman, Levy 1982 159"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guttman, Levy|first=Louis, Shlomit|title=On the definition and varieties of attitude and wellbeing|journal=Social Indicators Research|date=February 1982|volume=10|issue=2|pages=159–174|doi=10.1007/bf00302508}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach serves two purposes in the study of well-being: "developing and testing a [systematic] theory for the structure of [interrelationships] among varieties of well-being, and integration of well-being theory with the ongoing{{when|date=February 2015}} cumulative theory {{clarify|date=February 2015}} development in the fields of attitude of related research".&lt;ref name="Guttman, Levy 1982 159"/&gt;

==Models and components of wellbeing==

Many different models have developed.&lt;ref&gt; Measuring what matters: the role of well-being methods in development policy and practice, 2015, McGregor, Coulthard and Camfield, ODI, https://www.odi.org/publications/9657-measuring-matters-role-well-being-methods-development-policy-practice &lt;/ref&gt;

===Diener: tripartite model of subjective well-being===
{{Main|Tripartite model of subjective well-being}}

[[Ed Diener|Diener]]'s tripartite model of subjective well-being is one of the most comprehensive models of well-being in psychology. It was synthesized by Diener in 1984, positing "three distinct but often related components of wellbeing: frequent positive affect, infrequent negative affect, and cognitive evaluations such as life satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;Tov &amp; Diener (2013), ''Subjective Well-Being''. Research Collection School of Social Sciences. Paper 1395. {{cite web |url=http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/soss_research/1395 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605012602/http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/soss_research/1395/ |archivedate=2017-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive, affective and contextual factors contribute to subjective well-being.&lt;ref name="Galinha_Pais-Ribeiro_2011"&gt;Iolanda Costa Galinha &amp; José Luís Pais-Ribeiro (2011), ''Cognitive, affective and contextual predictors of subjective wellbeing''.  International Journal of Wellbeing, 2(1), 34–53. doi:10.5502/ijw.v2i1.3&lt;/ref&gt; According to Diener and Suh, subjective well-being is "...based on the idea that how each person thinks and feels about his or her life is important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diener, Suh|first=Ed, Eunkook|title=Culture and Subjective Well-being|year=2000|publisher=A Bradford Book|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corey Keyes: flourishing===
{{Main|Flourishing}}

According to [[Corey Keyes]], who collaborated with Carol Ryff, mental well-being has three components, namely emotional or subjective well-being (also called ''hedonic'' well-being),&lt;ref name="Robitschek"/&gt; psychological well-being, and social well-being (together also called ''eudaimonic'' well-being).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keyes|first=Corey L.

===Seligman: positive psychology===
{{Main|Positive psychology}}

Well-being is a central concept in [[positive psychology]]. Positive psychology is concerned with [[eudaimonia]], "the good life", reflection about what holds the greatest value in life – the factors that contribute the most to a well-lived and fulfilling life. While not attempting a strict definition of the good life, positive psychologists agree that one must live a [[Happiness|happy]], engaged, and meaningful life in order to experience "the good life". [[Martin Seligman]] referred to "the good life" as "using your signature strengths every day to produce authentic [[happiness]] and abundant gratification".&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M.E.P. (2009). Authentic Happiness. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Flourish'' (2011) Seligman argued that "meaningful life" can be considered as 3 different categories. The resulting acronym is [[Martin Seligman#PERMA|PERMA]]: Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning and purpose, and Accomplishments. It is a mnemonic for the five elements of Martin Seligman's well-being theory:&lt;ref name="Sze"&gt;David Sze (2015), [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-sze/the-father-of-positive-ps_b_7600226.html ''The Father of Positive Psychology and His Two Theories of Happiness''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625051421/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-sze/the-father-of-positive-ps_b_7600226.html |date=2017-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_2.html |title=THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2011— Page 2 |publisher=Edge.org |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210015906/http://edge.org/q2011/q11_2.html |archivedate=2011-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These emotions are frequently seen as connected to positive outcomes, such as longer life and healthier social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pursuit-of-happiness.org/history-of-happiness/martin-seligman-positive-psychology/|title=The Pursuit of Happiness|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109130710/http://www.pursuit-of-happiness.org/history-of-happiness/martin-seligman-positive-psychology/|archivedate=2015-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Engagement'' refers to involvement in activities that draws and builds upon one's interests. [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] explains true engagement as [[Flow (psychology)|flow]], a feeling of intensity that leads to a sense of ecstasy and clarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow?language=en|title=Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi TED talk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208203018/http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow?language=en|archivedate=2014-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task being done needs to call upon higher skill and be a bit difficult and challenging yet still possible. Engagement involves passion for and concentration on the task at hand and is assessed subjectively as to whether the person engaged was completely absorbed, losing self-consciousness.&lt;ref name="Seligman, M. E. P. 2011"/&gt;
* ''Relationships'' are all important in fueling positive emotions, whether they are work-related, familial, romantic, or platonic. As [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Dr. Christopher Peterson]] puts it simply, "Other people matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-beauty-in-the-beast/201210/other-people-matter|title=Other People Matter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans receive, share, and spread positivity to others through relationships.  They are important not only in bad times, but good times as well. In fact, relationships can be strengthened by reacting to one another positively. It is typical that most positive things take place in the presence of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/brain-and-behavior/articles/2009/06/24/using-positive-psychology-in-your-relationships|title=Using Positive Psychology in Your Relationships|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206061426/http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/brain-and-behavior/articles/2009/06/24/using-positive-psychology-in-your-relationships|archivedate=2014-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Meaning'' is also known as purpose, and prompts the question of "why". Discovering and figuring out a clear "why" puts everything into context from work to relationships to other parts of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-murphy/why-do-you-do-what-you-do_b_3873650.html|title=Why do You do What You Do?|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013074415/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-murphy/why-do-you-do-what-you-do_b_3873650.html|archivedate=2014-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding meaning is learning that there is something greater than one's self. Despite potential challenges, working with meaning drives people to continue striving for a desirable goal.
* ''Accomplishments'' are the pursuit of success and mastery.&lt;ref name="Seligman, M. E. P. 2011"/&gt; Unlike the other parts of PERMA, they are sometimes pursued even when accomplishments do not result in positive emotions, meaning, or relationships.  That being noted, accomplishments can activate the other elements of PERMA, such as pride, under positive emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awesomeculture.com/2011/09/13/the-science-of-a-happy-startup/|title=The Science of a Happy Startup|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20141206020015/http://awesomeculture.com/2011/09/13/the-science-of-a-happy-startup/|archivedate=2014-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accomplishments can be individual or community-based, fun- or work-based.

===UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) definition===
The UK [[Office for National Statistics|ONS]] defines wellbeing "''as having 10 broad dimensions which have been shown to matter most to people in the UK as identified through a national debate. The dimensions are: 
*''the natural environment,'' 
*''personal well-being,'' 
*''our relationships,'' 
*''health,'' 
*''what we do,'' 
*''where we live,'' 
*''personal finance,'' 
*''the economy,'' 
*''education and skills, and'' 
*''governance.'' 
''Personal wellbeing is a particularly important dimension which we define as how satisfied we are with our lives, our sense that what we do in life is worthwhile, our day to day emotional experiences (happiness and anxiety) and our wider mental wellbeing.''"&lt;ref&gt;https://whatworkswellbeing.org/about/what-is-wellbeing/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nagel: Experience as a good in itself===
[[Thomas Nagel]] has said that "''There are elements [of living] which, if added to one's experience, make life better; there are other elements which if added to one's experience, make life worse. But what remains when these are set aside is not merely neutral: it is emphatically positive.''"&lt;ref&gt;Further; "''Therefore life is worth living even when the bad elements of experience are plentiful, and the good ones too meager to outweigh the bad ones on their own. The additional positive weight is supplied by experience itself, rather than by any of its consequences.''" 'Death' (essay), Thomas Nagel, CUP, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/the-vise-side-of-life/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global studies==

[[File:Eudaimonic well-being Joshanloo.jpg|thumb|Eudaimonic well-being in 166 nations based on Gallup World Poll data]]

Research on positive psychology, well-being, eudaimonia and happiness, and the theories of Diener, Ryff, Keyes and Seligmann covers a broad range of levels and topics, including "the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life."{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}} The World Happiness Report series provide annual updates on the global status of [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Happiness Report |url=http://worldhappiness.report/ |website=World Happiness Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; A global study using data from 166 nations, provided a country ranking of psycho-social well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter study showed that subjective well-being and psycho-social well-being (i.e. [[eudaimonia]]) measures capture distinct constructs and are both needed for a comprehensive understanding of mental well-being.

''Example:'' A study was conducted to examine job resources, work engagement and Finnish dairy farmers’ preferences concerning methods to enhance overall well-being while working on farms.  The results indicate that the family, working with cattle, healthy farm animals, a reasonable workload, and a sustainable farm economy have the capacity to create positive impacts on well-being among dairy farmers. Well-being on farms is a part of sustainable food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kallioniemi|first=Marja K.|last2=Kaseva|first2=Janne|last3=Lunner Kolstrup|first3=Christina|last4=Simola|first4=Ahti|last5=Kymäläinen|first5=Hanna-Riitta|date=2018-07-03|title=Job Resources and Work Engagement among Finnish Dairy Farmers|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2018.1470047|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=249–261|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1470047|issn=1059-924X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Jonathan "Jonty" Alsop''' (1901 &amp;ndash; 10 November 1964) was a professional [[boxing|boxer]] from [[Wales]] who fought under the name '''Young Allsopp'''. Based in his home village of [[Trealaw]] in the [[Rhondda]] Valley, Allsopp was notable for becoming the Welsh bantamweight champion in 1921.

==Boxing career==
Alsop was born in the village of [[Trealaw]] in the industrial coal mining region of the Rhondda Valley to English parents who had moved to the area from Bristol.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Boxers of Wales: Rhondda|first=Gareth|last=Jones|year=2012|isbn=978-1-902719-33-7|publisher=St David's Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} A coal miner by profession, Alsop took to boxing as a youth and was fighting in recognized bouts while still a teenager. Early promotions gave him the name Young Allsopp (sic), and he fought under that nickname for the rest of his career.

From the beginnings of his career, Allsopp would travel into England to face opponents and was a regular fighter at the Liverpool Stadium. By the early 1920s a system of weight titles were devised for the Wales region, and Allsopp was selected as one of the Welsh fighters to challenge, through a series of eliminators, for the bantamweight title. On his way to the final, he beat Rhondda opponent Harold Jones, Blaenavon's Silas Bunch and Arthur Bishop from Caerphilly. This led to a showdown with Billy Davies from Cardiff, held at the Cardiff Empire on 22 October 1921.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;{{rp|4}} The fight was intended to be the main event at a charity tournament held to raise funds for the [[Mametz Wood Memorial|Mametz]] Ward at the [[Cardiff Royal Infirmary]], but the bout was overshadowed by a mock fight between [[Jimmy Wilde]] and popular music hall comedian [[George Robey]].&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;{{rp|4}} The fight between Allsopp and Davies was intended for 20 rounds, and the referee, [[Jim Driscoll]], was called upon during the fight to admonish Davies in the early rounds. Davies was cut through the illegal use of the head, but also suffered from the superior boxing skills displayed by Allsopp. In the 11th round Davies charged head-down into an attack and suffered a gash to his forehead. He was behind on points, and his seconds [[Submission (combat sports)|threw in the towel]], leaving Allsopp the Welsh bantamweight champion.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

Allsopp only defended his title once, against [[Albert Colcombe]], a fighter originally from [[Tylorstown]] in Wales, but then based in Yorkshire. The fight was held at the Llwynypia Baths to a packed house on 20 May 1922. Although set for twenty rounds, the fight only reached the tenth, after Allsopp was stopped through a badly cut eye. Allsopp fought on for a few more years, before a fall from a roof ended both his fighting and mining careers. He sold his Welsh title belt to fund a business as a confectioner, with shops in the Rhondda and Rhoose. He died from a heart attack in 1964 at the age of 63.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;{{rp|5}}
