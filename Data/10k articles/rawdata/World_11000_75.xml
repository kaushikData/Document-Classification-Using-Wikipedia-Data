On display in the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], in the African Art and Indian Art of the Americas, is a 19th-century [[drinking horn]]. Originally from the [[Kuba Kingdom]], the drinking horn is made out of wood, iron, and copper alloy. Drinking horns were usually a gift to the friends and family of kings or given to a warrior.

== History ==

=== Kuba Kingdom ===
{{main|Kuba Kingdom}}
[[File:Democratic Republic of Congo.png|thumb|Highlights where Congo is]]

The Kuba Kingdom, founded in the 17th century, is located in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It held nine provinces and chiefdoms were a part of that society.&lt;ref&gt;The Evolution of Culture and Institutions: Evidence from the Kuba Kingdom, http://econ.columbia.edu/files/econ/content/kuba_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They were surrounded by other tribes such as the [[Yaka people|Yaka]], Suku, [[Pende people|Pende]], etc. The people from the Kuba kingdom were also known as the Bakuba.&lt;ref&gt;Kuba People, http://www.britannica.com/topic/Kuba-people&lt;/ref&gt; They were skilled at hunting, farming, and fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Kuba background, http://kubaafricanart.weebly.com/background.html&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more important aspects of the Kuba kingdom was their religion. They were heavily based on the spirits of mother earth and those of their past kings.&lt;ref&gt;Kuba People, http://www.britannica.com/topic/Kuba-people&lt;/ref&gt; When it came to their religious ceremonies, the way someone was buried depended on the items placed in the coffin. For the wealthy, they had several items such as delicate figurines, masks, and drinking cups placed in their coffin.&lt;ref&gt;Kuba People, http://www.britannica.com/topic/Kuba-people&lt;/ref&gt; The detail and quality of the items told where they were in the social hierarchy.

== 19th Century Drinking Horn ==

=== Object History ===

The Kuba kingdom was located in what is known today as the Democratic Republic of Congo. The kingdom was known for their supernatural powers and spiritual beliefs. Like many kingdoms, royalty was one of the most important parts. Besides having one ruler, they had 19 other rulers underneath the king that managed the 19 groups in Kuba. One of the many ways that these kings showed their status and power was by the amount of money they spent. When it comes to drinking horns, kings would give them out to their family and friends to show their wealth and generosity. 
Drinking horns were one of the many objects that showed class. The more elegant and intrinsic the design, the higher in society they were.&lt;ref&gt;Bortolot, Alexander. "Kingdoms of the Savanna: The Kuba Kingdom, The Metropolitan Museum of Art."http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kuba/hd_kuba.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The patterns and material made for the drinking horn was an important aspect to show status. Drinking horns were typically used to drink palm wine. The intake of this beverage is an example of something that was done with events held by the king. This may also be an event in which the king shows his generosity and hands out gifts. 
The drinking horn is in the shape of a buffalo horn that symbolizes the status of the warrior that received it. The design of the horn includes patterns that are in a geometrical shape, a crocodile, and a hand.&lt;ref&gt;Art Institute of Chicago, http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/88689&lt;/ref&gt; This specific drinking horn has an attachment made out of iron that can be attached to a belt that the warrior would wear. The fact that the drinking horn has this accessory and option to be attached to a belt shows a high level of status within not only the Kuba society, but also the warrior community.

=== Ownership History ===

This specific drinking horn was first owned by object collector, Raoul Blondiau. He was a collector and diplomat who was based in Brussels. Blondiau is a well-known collector that is mentioned several times in many different institutions.&lt;ref&gt;The Blondiau-Theatre Arts Collection and the Harlem Renaissance, http://metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2012/african-art/blondiau-harlem-renaissance&lt;/ref&gt; Blondiau then sold the drinking horn to the [[Theatre Arts Monthly]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Art Institute of Chicago, http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/88689&lt;/ref&gt; It was a part of the Harlem Museum of African Art Travelling Exhibit at that time. During the ownership of the Theater Arts Monthly, it was lent to the Chicago Children’s Museum for Negro in Art Week. It was lent during the month of December. Being a part of a traveling exhibit, the object moved around. At one point, it was lent to the Memorial Art Gallery in Rochester, New York.
In the Art Institute of Chicago’s website, it is said to have been gifted to the museum by G. F. Harding in 1928. No information has been found concerning G. F. Harding.

&lt;!--Per MOS:BOLDTITLE and WP:SBE, please do not reword this to include the article's title.--&gt;A large-scale, drought-induced [[famine]] occurred in Africa's [[Sahel]] region and many parts of the neighboring [[Sénégal River Area]] from February to August 2010. It is one of many famines to have hit the region in recent times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldpress.org/Africa/719.cfm Famine Drought Spreads Across Continent] Worldpress.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sahel]] is the ecoclimatic and [[biogeographic]] zone of transition between the [[Sahara desert]] in the north of Africa and the [[Sudanian savannas]] in the south, covering an area of 3,053,200 square kilometers. It is a transitional [[ecoregion]] of semi-arid grasslands, [[savanna]]s, [[steppes]], and thorn shrublands.&lt;ref name="wwf"&gt;
{{WWF ecoregion | name = Sahelian Acacia savanna | id=at0713 | accessdate =7 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neighboring [[Sénégal River Area]] contains various vegetation types and covers parts or all of [[Mauritania]], [[Mali]], [[Senegal]] and [[Guinea]]. It has also had very low rainfall over the last year according to the [[UN]], NGOs and the [[Organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve Sénégal|Senegal River Basin Development Authority]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/fromthefield/222031/127409150030.htm ACT Alert: Food Insecurity in Mauritania due to Drought situation in the Sahel region] Reuters AlertNet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/fromthefield/222031/127549655260.htm ACT Preliminary Appeal: Food insecurity in Mauritania due to Drought in the Sahel region] AlertNet&lt;/ref&gt; Sudan set a new temperature record of 49.7&amp;nbsp;°C (121.3&amp;nbsp;°F) on 22 June, in the town of [[Dongola]].&lt;ref name="MastersNOAA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masters |first=Jeff |title=NOAA: June 2010 the globe's 4th consecutive warmest month on record |url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1544 |work=Weather Underground |publisher=Jeff Masters' WunderBlog |accessdate=21 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719104107/http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1544 |archivedate=19 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Famine and food shortages were present in the following Sahelian countries during 2010 after heavy rains hit the region in late 2009, followed by a [[heat wave]]:&lt;ref name="alertnet.org"&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LDE60Q14F.htm "Strong risk" of 2010 famine in Africa's Sahel&amp;nbsp;– EU] Reuters AlertNet&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sudan]], the [[Niger]], northern [[Nigeria]], northern [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], [[Senegal]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mauritania]], [[Mali]], as well as in parts of the neighboring [[Sénégal River Area]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="magharebia.com"&gt;[http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/newsbriefs/general/2010/05/18/newsbrief-05 Mauritania heat wave kills 7] Magharebia&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, both [[USAID]] and several NGOs predicted an increased food insecurity situation in more of the southern [[Cercles of Mali|districts]] of Mali as compared to the same time the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:9MecWs-5JVIJ:pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADS238.pdf+2010tiboktou+famin&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESibJ501V8unNlpZyLydMWdvnISPQtmOwyqvliUjPXDFJsc3eWrgAg6y876gyLbbktdGqoIFJax3G9c6J7TM3mhvK558us4wZm0cBkx2ynmHsYGFPuo3SN-jNkm4EQIHZP4W5kAN&amp;sig=AHIEtbTuGBncT_7sqQAfP5DCui2xIUYTEg Mali Food Security Outlook] PNADS238.pdf&amp;nbsp;– Powered by Google Docs&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental problems===
The Western donor nations once theorised that the drought in the [[Sahel]] primarily was caused by humans over-using [[natural resources]] in the region through [[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622803000183| doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2003.08.004 | volume=23 | issue=4 | title=Deforestation in afforestation priority zone in Sudano-Sahelian Nigeria | journal=Applied Geography | pages=227–259| year=2003 | last1=Odihi | first1=J }}&lt;/ref&gt; and poor [[land management]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eden-foundation.org/project/desertif.html "Desertification&amp;nbsp;– a threat to the Sahel", August 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0801/p01s02-woaf.html Hunger is spreading in Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, climate model studies suggested that large-scale climate changes were also triggers for the drought.

In the early 2000s, after the phenomenon of [[global dimming]] was discovered, some speculatively suggested, that the drought was likely caused by air pollution generated in [[Eurasia]] and North America. The pollution changed the properties of clouds over the Atlantic Ocean, disturbing the [[monsoon]]s and shifting the [[tropical rain belt|tropical rain]]s southwards. [[Global dimming]], the blocking of sunlight by man-made [[particulate]]s, has been identified as one culprit for a decades-long drought across [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3310_sun.html Transcript of the program "Dimming the Sun"] from [[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]], [[Public Broadcasting Service]] airdate: 18 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study by [[NOAA]] scientists [[Rong Zhang]] and [[Thomas L. Delworth]] suggests that the [[Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation]]/(MAO) plays a leading role. An AMO warm phase strengthens the summer rainfall over [[Sahel]], while a cold phase reduces it.&lt;ref name="Zhang2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Rong |author2=Delworth, Thomas L. |year=2006 |title=Impact of Atlantic multidecadal oscillations on India/Sahel rainfall and Atlantic hurricanes |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=33 |issue=17 |pages=L17712 |doi=10.1029/2006GL026267 |url= |quote= |bibcode=2006GeoRL..3317712Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AMO entered a warm phase in 1995 and, by assuming the presence of a theoretical 70-year cycle (following peaks in ≈1880 and ≈1950), it would probably peak around about 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Enfield |first=David B. |author2=Cid-Serrano, Luis |year=2009 |title=Secular and multi-decadal warming in the North Atlantic and their relationships with major hurricane activity |journal=International Journal of Climatology |volume=30 |pages= n/a|doi=10.1002/joc.1881 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Demise of Lake Chad===
The [[Lake Chad basin]] straddles the borders of both [[Niger]], Nigeria, [[Cameroon]] and [[Chad]]. The lake is situated {{convert|281|m|ft}} above sea level and is diminishing over time due to lack of rain water and major rivers running into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/News/cha006_drought_env.htm |title=cha006 Drought in Chad bodes ill for food supply |publisher=Afrol.com |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the UN the marshy lake shrank as much as by 95% from about 1963 to 1998&lt;ref name="United Nations 2007"&gt;[http://na.unep.net/atlas/webatlas.php?id=58 Atlas of Our Changing Environment]&lt;/ref&gt; yet they also state that "The 2007 (satellite) image shows significant improvement over previous years". Lake Chad is economically important, providing water to more than 20 million people living in the four countries that surround it ([[Chad]], Cameroon, [[Niger]], and [[Nigeria]]) on the edge of the [[Sahara Desert]]. The plant [[Typha Australis]] (or the big cattail) is cutting off water supplies in the [[Chad Basin|Lake Chad Basin]], and has slashed available water supplies in the Chad's region.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mdsomerfield.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mdsomerfield.com/?p=47 |title= What caused the 2010 Niger famine? |website= MD Somerfield: A minimum viable blog |accessdate=24 August 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only protected area is [[Lake Chad Game Reserve]], which covers half of the area next to the lake that belongs to Nigeria. The whole lake has been declared a [[Ramsar site]] of international importance.

Lake Chad's role in the Sahel famine has attracted attention partly due to the [[desertification]] that is increasingly claiming a huge swath not just of the Sahel region but also the entire African continent. According to a [[United Nations]] environment program, in 2002, this phenomenon, which is a process where the soil loses the capacity to retain necessary moisture, has covered nearly half of Africa.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Famine: A Short History|last=Grada|first=Cormac|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780691122373|location=Princeton|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed that the Sahel region is one of the areas that are worst affected.

The problem is also highlighted by the discovery of fossil pollens indicating that, in ancient times, the shores of Lake Chad supported a well-watered [[savanna]], which contributed to a lesser level of [[arid]]ity in the Sahel area.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Floods, Famines, and Emperors: El Nino and the Fate of Civilizations|last=Fagan|first=Brian|publisher=Perseus Books Group|year=2009|isbn=9780786727681|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that around 3,000 B.C., the Sahel averaged 650 millimeters of rainfall a year compared to an average of 350 millimeters recorded today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Given the issue of desertification, even if Lake Chad was not directly a cause of the famine, its potential demise is expected to further aggravate the problem. There are studies that show that the incidence of famine is reportedly related to the delicate seasonal variations in the [[Intertropical convergence zone|intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tales of the Earth: Paroxysms and Perturbations of the Blue Planet|last=Officer|first=Charles|last2=Page|first2=Jake|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780195090482|location=Oxford|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shrinking of Lake Chad is blamed on the long droughts as well as the uptick in human activities such as the use of the lake's water for irrigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Deserts|last=Claybourne|first=Anna|publisher=Hodder Wayland|year=2005|isbn=1583404252|location=Suffolk|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the destruction of wooded areas for firewood, and the shift from the cultivation of corn and wheat to rice as the staple crop.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====The Ubangi River diversion proposal====
In the 1960s, a plan was proposed to divert the [[Ubangi River]] into [[Lake Chad]]. The copious amount of water from the Ubangi would revitalize the dying Lake Chad and provide livelihood in fishing and enhanced agriculture to tens of millions of central Africans and [[Sahel]]ians. Inter-basin water transfer schemes were proposed in the 1980s and 1990s by [[Nigeria]]n engineer [[J. Umolu]] (ZCN Scheme) and Italian firm [[Bonifica]] (Transaqua Scheme).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hydroweb.com/jeh/jeh1999/bunu.pdf Journal of Environmental Hydrology, Vol. 7, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg12917615.500 New Scientist, 23 March 1991 Africa at a [[drainage divide|Watershed]] (Ubangi&amp;nbsp;– Lake Chad Inter-basin transfer)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Umolu, J.

===Over-population===
Many of the world's countries, including many in Sub-saharan Africa, the Middle East and [[South East Asia]], have seen a sharp rise in population since the end of the [[Cold War]]. The fear is that high population numbers are putting further strain on natural resources, food supplies, fuel supplies, employment, housing, etc.; in some of the less fortunate countries. The population of [[Chad]] has, for example, ultimately grown from 6,279,921 in 1993 to 10,329,208 in 2009,&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web|author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=[[The World Factbook]] |title=Chad |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cd.html |year=2009 |accessdate=28 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129154104/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cd.html |archivedate=29 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; further straining its resources. [[Nigeria]] is witnessing a similar growth in population, strained resources and a possible [[Human overpopulation|over-population]] problem in the near future.

The situation was most acute in northern, western and central Africa. Refugees from places like the [[Sudan]] have helped further strain the resources of neighboring states like the Chad and Egypt. The nation is also host to roughly 255,000 [[refugee]]s from Sudan's [[Darfur]] region, and about 77,000 refugees from the [[Central African Republic]], whilst approximately 188,000 Chadians have been displaced by their own civil war and famines, have either fled to either the Sudan, the Niger or, more recently, [[Libya]].&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/03/drought-hunger-west-Africa |title=Severe drought causes hunger for 10 million in west Africa |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607034159/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jun/03/drought-hunger-west-africa |archivedate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfp.org/countries/chad |title=Chad &amp;#124; WFP &amp;#124; United Nations World Food Programme&amp;nbsp;– Fighting Hunger Worldwide |publisher=WFP |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfp.org/content/emergency-food-assistance-drought-affected-population-chad |title=Emergency Food Assistance to Drought-affected Population in Chad &amp;#124; WFP &amp;#124; United Nations World Food Programme&amp;nbsp;– Fighting Hunger Worldwide |publisher=WFP |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aid workers being driven off by kidnappers===
On 25 August a French aid worker was kidnapped in Chad.&lt;ref name="afrikaspeaks.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrikaspeaks.com/?p=Archive&amp;cat=General&amp;title=French+aid+worker+seized+in+Chad&amp;curpage=61 |title=French aid worker seized in Chad " Afrika Speaks &amp;#124; Reporting News in Africa by Africans.

The organizations are thus pulling out in fear of their workers' lives.

Most [[international aid agencies]] have been withdrawing workers from some areas of the Sahel, due to the regional kidnapping crisis. [[Niger]]'s government spokesman [[Mahamane Lawali Danda]] told the [[BBC|B.B.C.]] that the pullout was a surprise to him since no one had told him or his government that Niger was on the list of dangerous 'kidnapper infested' [[pariah nations]], along with [[Chad]], [[Darfur]] and [[Sudan]]. Strangely, [[Mauritania]] and [[Mali]] were not on the list of dangerous nations, despite several [[al-Qaeda]] lead kidnappings in both during 2009.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129316900 |title=In Grip Of Drought, Floods, Niger Faces Hunger Crisis |publisher=NPR |date=20 August 2010 |accessdate=12 February 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110215011701/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129316900| archivedate= 15 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===January===
11 January saw an emerging famine situation in south eastern [[Sudan]] according to the UN, NGOs, the EU and various Charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fews.net/docs/Publications/Sudan_January2010_Alert_final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716094239/http://www.fews.net/docs/Publications/Sudan_January2010_Alert_final.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of [[Niger]] says 7,800,000 risk starvation in 2010 as heavy drought and high heat hit Niger, [[Burkina Faso]], Mali, [[Chad]] and northern [[Nigeria]] on both 27 and 28 January and was estimated to need about $220,000,000 million this year in food and agricultural aid.&lt;ref name="alertnet.org"/&gt; The EU's [[ECHO (European Commission)|ECHO aid department]] said of signs of food shortages were in Niger and spreading to neighbors such as [[Burkina Faso]], Mali, [[Chad]] and northern [[Nigeria]] as 15,000,000 are estimated to face a chronic food shortage in Niger. The EU and UN also put out a famine alert for Niger, [[Burkina Faso]], Mali, [[Chad]] and northern [[Nigeria]] and began to appeal for aid&lt;ref name="alertnet.org"/&gt; on the 28th. The EU, China and [[Russia]] stopped giving Niger aid in 2009 after President [[Mamadou Tandja]] defied UN, EU and worldwide criticism over extending his term in office.&lt;ref name="alertnet.org"/&gt;

===February===
The UN, NGOs and charities warned of heavy [[food insecurity]] in [[Southern Sudan]] throughout February due to an emerging famine and the ongoing conflict between [[Misseriya]] [[nomad]] in the [[Southern Kordofan]] department. The rainfall was reported at an all-time low in [[Mauritania]] and neighboring parts of [[Senegal]] during most of February and early March.

The EU warns of a pending Sahel famine centered upon Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/177702.php West Africa's Sahel Belt Could Face Famine In 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; on 1 February.

===March===

A drought was confirmed to have hit parts of [[Burkina Faso]] on 10 March, by [[USAID]] and the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/dbc.nsf/doc104?OpenForm&amp;rc=1&amp;cc=bfa |title=ReliefWeb " Burkina Faso |publisher=.reliefweb.int |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2010 the UN, NGOs, the EU and various charities put out a famine alert for parts of southern [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fews.net/docs/Publications/Sudan_March_2010_Alert_final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716094323/http://www.fews.net/docs/Publications/Sudan_March_2010_Alert_final.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 2010 Britain's [[Save The Children]] charity launched an appeal as 840,000 Nigerians are confirmed to be in imminent risk of a famine.&lt;ref name="soschildrensvillages.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/archive/2010/03/niger-famine-2010-emergency-appeal |title=Niger Famine 2010 Emergency Appeal&amp;nbsp;– SOS Children |publisher=Soschildrensvillages.org.uk |date=15 March 2010 |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March 2010, a famine was declared in [[Mao (Chad)|Mao]] in Chad's sand-swept [[Kanem region]].&lt;ref name="wfp.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/content/theres-famine-chad |title=There's A Famine In Chad &amp;#124; WFP &amp;#124; United Nations World Food Programme&amp;nbsp;– Fighting Hunger Worldwide |publisher=WFP |date=17 March 2010 |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===May===
On 1 May 2010, the West African nation of Chad was on the verge of a nationwide famine as drought, armed conflict, and an influx of [[Darfur]] refugees all contributed to a chronic [[Economic shortage|food shortage]] that now affects 2,000,000 people (20% of the country's total population).

The new [[military junta]] appealed for international food aid and has taken serious steps to call overseas help since coming to office in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100625-reporters-niger-famine-horizon-harvests-sahara-junta-coup-appeal-international-aid-mamadou-tandja |title=Niger: famine on the horizon? |publisher=France24 |accessdate=12 February 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110122113632/http://www.france24.com/en/20100625-reporters-niger-famine-horizon-harvests-sahara-junta-coup-appeal-international-aid-mamadou-tandja| archivedate= 22 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudan witnessed minor [[food riot]]ing in [[Southern Kordofan]], [[Blue Nile]], and [[Abyei]] as [[Profiteering (business)|profiteering]] locals and merchants and [[Uganda]]n exporters took advantage of the shortages in order to heavily mark up their selling prices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kline.org/campaign/East{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Sudanian savanna/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

15 July saw more border conflicts between the [[Nuer people|Nuer]] and the [[Dinka people|Dinka]], further hindering aid workers in [[Southern Sudan]].&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/campaigns/sudan98/index.htm |title=Sudan: Analysis of the Current Fighting and its Relation to Famine &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=1 March 2001 |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 July, Mohamed Béavogui, the Director of Western and Central Africa Division of the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD), called for more international help for the people of the Sahel, who had a 410,000 tons of cereals and 20,000 tons of fodder deficit. He also condemned the world for not doing enough to help the Sahel, but stopped short of [[Cheminade]]'s idea of pumping water from the [[Zaire River]] into [[Lake Chad]] to reinvigorate its water supply and stop any further shrinkage.

On 24 July, the [[British Red Cross]] flew its logistics teams [[Bristol Airport]] to Niger to help the army and local officials with transportation. The relief effort has already been made possible by the response to the Red Cross's West Africa Crisis Appeal, which aims to raise £500,000. According to UN agencies, 200,000 children need treatment for malnutrition in Niger alone, as [[Oxfam]] put out an £7,000,000 appeal to cover both [[Chad]] and Niger.&lt;ref name="alertnet.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/niger/1494739/Red-Cross-flies-team-out-on-Niger-famine-mission.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Chine |last=Mbubaegbu |title=Red Cross flies team out on Niger famine mission |date=24 July 2005 |accessdate=24 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201194255/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/niger/1494739/Red-Cross-flies-team-out-on-Niger-famine-mission.html| archivedate= 1 December 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

27 July also saw a critical situation occurring in northern Mali and Chad. About 8,000,0000 Nigerians, 1,600,000 Chadians and 500,000 Malians were on the verge of a major food shortage as the Nigerian journalist [[Tidiane Kassé]] said that by tackling the consequences rather than the causes would be a better form of long-term help for the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/66292 |title=Food crisis in the Sahel: Real problem, false solutions |publisher=Pambazuka |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July, leading economists predicted that food prices, especially wheat, would rise in Chad as [[Russia]] ends exports due to a domestic drought destroying their wheat and barley harvests.

===August===

On 1 August, [[Gadabeji]], Niger suffered 35&amp;nbsp;°C heat and drought.&lt;ref name="niger"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/01/niger-famine-food-crisis |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=Niger's markets are full yet famine shadows the dusty roads |first=Afua |last=Hirsch |date=1 August 2010 |accessdate=24 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211173944/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/01/niger-famine-food-crisis |archivedate=11 December 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August, just under 12,000,000 people in Niger (approximately 80% of the nation's entire population) faced a [[food supply]] crisis and possibly even [[famine]] conditions.&lt;ref name="niger" /&gt; The [[Tillabéri]] region is 30&amp;nbsp;km from the capital, [[Niamey]], on the road to the [[Sahara]]n town of [[Timbuktu]].&lt;ref name="niger" /&gt; Unusually severe rainfall destroyed and then rotted the farmers' crops.&lt;ref name="niger" /&gt; Basic food stuffs like maize, [[millet]] and [[sorghum]] were running out in West Africa's [[Sahel]].

An estimated 8,000,000 people faced famine conditions in Niger on 11 August.

On 12 August, Gianluca Ferrera, deputy director for the UN's [[World Food Programme]] in the Niger, said malnutrition and crop failures were at a record levels in 2010. Food shortages are affecting 12,000,000 people and 400,000 children face [[starvation]]. Food prices rose by about 300% since the crisis began and thus hardly any one can afford to buy the remaining food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/editorial/markets-full,-famine-persists-380 |accessdate=17 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806125754/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/editorial/markets-full%2C-famine-persists-380 |archivedate=6 August 2010 |title=Markets full, famine persists |first1=Afua |last1=Hirsch |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

14 August saw protests across [[Senegal|Sénégal]] over concerns relating to the ruling party's poor governance in the face of recent floods, storms and power cuts across the country, along with the current heavy drought in [[Senegal]]'s Sahel region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.einnews.com/login.php?redir=%2Fnews.php%3Fwid%3D308875194&amp;n=1&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 August, floods which were the worst for 80 years hit the Shale region. The U.N. warned that Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso, Cameroon and northern Nigeria are also in the grip of the worst regional [[food crisis]] since 2006. In the [[savannah]] [[Kano]], Nigeria, over 2,000 families were displaced by floods and in the nearby [[Jigawa]] region, an entire village was evacuated due to heavy flooding. In [[Mauritania]], a flood damaged bridges and many homes in the mountain town of [[El Aioun, Mauritania|Aioun]]. Heavy flooding was occurring around parts of [[lake Chad]].&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

Most [[international aid agencies]] withdraw workers due to the regional kidnapping crisis. [[Niger]]'s government spokesman Mahamane Lawali Danda told the [[BBC]] that the pullout came as a surprise since no one had told his government Niger was on the list of dangerous 'kidnapper infested' [[pariah state]]s, along with Chad, [[Darfur]] and [[Sudan]]. Mauritania and [[Mali]] were not on the list of dangerous nations, despite several [[al-Qaeda]] lead kidnappings during 2009.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

The U.N. warned of mass starvation in Niger and Chad and [[Oxfam]] said people in the region were surviving on leaves and berries picked in the wild. 8,000,000 were said to be near starvation by both organisation.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; The UN estimated that up to 7,800,000 Nigeriens were affected by heavy food shortages. [[Cafod]] set up a £100,000 aid programme on 21 August.&lt;ref name="cafod.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cafod.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/emergencies/niger-drought |title=Niger: responding to drought |publisher=CAFOD |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

25 August had a French aid worker kidnapped in Chad.&lt;ref name="afrikaspeaks.com"/&gt; The kidnapping of foreigners along the Chad–Darfur border became more frequent in 2009. A French NGO worker was taken and then murdered on 29 October 2009,&lt;ref name="sudaneseonline.com"/&gt; and an unidentified Red Cross worker was captured on 10 November 2009.&lt;ref name="earthtimes.org"/&gt; Many NGOs and charities had started to restrict the areas covered by their aid work in Niger, Chad and Sudan, due to the ever-present risk of [[bandit]]s and [[kidnap]]ers.

On 28 August, charities and NGOs put out food shortage alerts for Niger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/alex-haxton-the-next-disaster-has-already-begun-2064722.html |location=London |work=The Independent |title=The next disaster has already begun |date=29 August 2010| accessdate=24 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy rain falls on the border of the [[Central African Republic|CAR]] and the Chad.

On 31 August Sudan's army reported that 3 Russian helicopter crew members had been abducted by gunmen in Nyala, capital of South Darfur, just hours after [[Samaritan's Purse]] aid worker [[Flavia Wagner]] who had been kidnapped 18 May was set free.&lt;ref name="english.sina.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="english.sina.com"/&gt; She was taken from the [[South Darfur]]ian village of [[Abu Ajura]], along with two Sudanese colleagues who were also freed after a week.&lt;ref name="english.sina.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="english.sina.com"/&gt; The governor of South Darfur, [[Abdel Hamid Kasha]], Sudan [[foreign ministry]] spokesman [[Moawiya Osman]] and Samaritan's Purse's leader [[Franklin Graham]], and the Russian ambassador to Chad welcomed Flavia's release, but condemned the [[kidnap]] of the three Russians and that of two [[Jordan]]ian [[UNAMID]] police advisers in Darfur, on the 14th.&lt;ref name="english.sina.com"/&gt; Another Russian [[helicopter]] pilot was taken prisoner for four days after landing in [[South Darfur]] to take rebels' spokesmen to Chad for alleged peace talks.&lt;ref name="english.sina.com"/&gt;

==Long term food security plans==

===Food security schemes===
[[File:Map of CILSS.svg|thumb|250px|The [[Permanent Interstate Committee for drought control in the Sahel|CILSS]] member states.]]

Against a backdrop of conventional interventions through the state or markets, alternative initiatives have been pioneered to address the problem of food security. An example is the "[[Community Area-Based Development Approach]]" to agricultural development ("CABDA"), an NGO programme with the objective of providing an alternative approach to increasing food security in Africa. CABDA proceeds through specific areas of intervention such as the introduction of drought-resistant crops and new methods of food production such as agro-forestry. In an analysis of the programme by the [[Overseas Development Institute]], CABDA's focus on individual and community capacity-building is highlighted. This enables farmers to influence and drive their own development through community-run institutions, bringing food security to their household and region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Aquifer usage===
[[Mali]] and [[Libya]] were also tapping into the ancient [[Sub-Saharan aquifer]] and [[Bas Saharan Basin]] as a source of drinking water, as of 2009 and 2008 respectively.

On 9 June 2010 various groups of [[hydrologists]], geologists and scientists in the Sahara desert used [[magnetic imaging techniques]] when looking for sites in [[aquifer]]s for drilling [[water wells]] in Eastern [[Chad]]. Northern [[Mali]], southern [[Libya]], southern [[Algeria]], eastern Chad were being examined in part of an ongoing project to find viable drilling as the region's nations try to find new water sources to keep up with their growing demand.

The [[Food Crises Prevention and Management Charter]] was validated on 11 August 2010, in the drought that hit [[Gambia]]. The signatory countries were from the [[Permanent Interstate Committee for drought control in the Sahel]] (CILLS) and [[West Africa Club]] (SWAC), and the [[Gambia]], which was also hosting the event. Mali, Mauritania, Senegal and the Gambia chose to express specific opinions on how to stop any further droughts in the region. The goal of the treaty is to help avert and mitigate the effects of future droughts, [[famine]]s and [[Economic shortage|food shortage]]s in the member states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.einnews.com/login.php?redir=%2Fnews.php%3Fwid%3D308267918&amp;n=1&lt;/ref&gt; The CILSS was created in 1973 during the first of the 'great droughts' of the late 20th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1589">The '''9th Soviet Antarctic Expedition''' was the [[Soviet Antarctic Expedition]] that ran from 1963 to 16 March 1965.

The expedition was led by Dr. [[Mikhail Somov]]. This expedition featured the first [[Great Britain|British]] exchange scientist, a [[glaciologist]].

Two ships carried the expedition from the [[Baltic sea]] to [[Antarctica]], the ''Ob'', an [[icebreaker]] and the ''Estonia'', a [[passenger liner]].

==Research==
Research during the expedition was split into two groups. The first being geophysical; [[seismology]], [[geomagnetism]], [[earth current]]s, [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]], [[cosmic rays]], radio propagation, [[aerology]] and [[meteorology]]. The second group was more fieldwork based; mapping new land, [[oceanography]], [[geology]] and [[glaciology]] etc.

'''Al-Alam''' is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] news channel broadcasting from [[Iran]] and is owned by the state-owned media corporation [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]] (IRIB).

The network's political coverage tends to be the most popular; however, other subjects, such as commentaries, analysis, [[business]] and [[sports]] also get a share of the audience. Programs are broadcast for over 300 million [[Arabs|Arab people]] around the world, with large audiences in the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] regions.  The [[satellite]] channel can be received in five continents.

Al-Alam has news bureaus in [[Tehran]], [[Beirut]] and [[Baghdad]]. Unlike many other channels, Al-Alam can be viewed in [[Iraq]] without the use of a satellite receiver, as it is able to use a terrestrial transmitter close to the Iran-Iraq border.

An English language website, known as '''Alalam News''', was launched on August 15, 2006, claiming to disseminate news in an impartial moderate manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alalam.ir/english/service/about-us.htm Alalam News - about us]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alalam News Network launched its [[Persian language|Persian]] website in April 2007 in order to cover news exclusively in the Persian language.

==Political alignment ==

During latest years, and at the zenith of sensitive periods of global and regional developments, and due to its perception and comprehension of its media message in playing a major and effective role in preserving Islamic countries’ independence and security, Al-Alam news channel dedicated a special interest with this respect, the following are excerpts of those media activities:

=== War against Saddam Hussein ===

At the first hours of [[2003 invasion of Iraq|US-led forces attack against Iraq]], Al-Alam news channel started its swift and speedy coverage of the developments and events in that Muslim country at a noticeable pace; in addition, it dispatched the first pictorial reports about the presence of occupation forces.
In view of the fact that international news agencies and mainstream media applauded Al-Alam news channel presence in Iraq, this important and active media apparatus converted to an essential and main news source for the Iraqi nation. Al-Alam news channel played a transparent and accurate role through presenting programs and news analyses in order to enlighten Iraqi public opinion with regard to the process of forming the government in Baghdad in addition to negotiations’ process that led to the signing of st American administration.

=== 33 Day War ===

During the thirty-three-day [[2006 Lebanon War]] launched by Israel against Lebanon in response to [[Hezbollah]]'s arresting of two Israeli soldiers, Al-Alam news channel had a broad coverage of events.

=== Capturing of British nationals by the Iranian Navy ===
{{main article|2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel}}

On March 30, Al-Alam aired the video of captive Royal Navy personnel. During the [[2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel]] al-Alam reported with regard to British soldiers’ confessions about the infringement of Iran’s maritime sovereignty, Al-Alam news channel had an important portion in covering that incident. It was the forerunner in transmitting British soldiers’ confessions, as well as it was the main and prime source for media coverage in this respect.

=== Gaza War ===
When the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] started, Al-Alam suspended its ordinary daily programs and focused on reporting from the Gaza strip. It provided speedy coverage from the sites of battle, whilst attempting to present the Iranian take of the events.

=== 2011 Bahraini protests ===
During the Shiite anti-government protests in Bahrain, the Al-Alam signal was repeatedly jammed. Allegations all point to the fact that 'Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah', the Saudi Intelligence Agency, has been traced back to for clear and valid evidence of this crime. The jamming attacks were reportedly caused by installations capable of interfering with Al-Alam's frequencies on the Badr satellite from a Saudi transmitter, sources say. This act of sabotage and illegal interference with free media has yet to be addressed in an international case.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presstv.com/detail/170209.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographical coverage ==

Al-Alam news channel covers all parts of the globe, with the exception of the southern part of African continent, using the following 3 satellites:
Hotbird 8, Eutelsat 7 West A and Galaxy 19. It is also broadcast terrestrially on VHF channel E4 from high ground near to the Iraqi border.

== Programs ==

=== “Maal hadath” (With the event). ===

The '''Barrack Road drill hall''' is a military installation in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]

==History==
The drill hall was designed as the headquarters of the 1st Northumberland Artillery Volunteers and was completed around 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twsitelines.info/SMR/6860|title=Newcastle, Barrack Road, Drill Hall|publisher=Tyne and Wear site lines|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site also accommodated a riding school and stabling for 14 horses.&lt;ref name=armstrong&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VoWuCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Barrack+Road+Drill+hall+Newcastle&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v3-h5Rk1L-&amp;sig=-KhCnDNKRl3XpbpCn6GxH_YH-bQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiaobbzx6LUAhVsJcAKHVdLAXMQ6AEIRzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Barrack%20Road%20Drill%20hall%20Newcastle&amp;f=false |title=Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in the Great War|first= Craig|last= Armstrong|publisher=Pen and Sword|year=2015|isbn=978-1473857742|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the formation of the [[Territorial Force]] in 1908, the drill hall became the home of the 1st Northumbrian Brigade, Royal Field Artillery as well as two of its three batteries (the third was at [[Armstrong Whitworth|Elswick Ordnance Works]] in Dunn Street).&lt;ref name=armstrong/&gt; The brigade was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 and, after being deployed to France and being re-designated 250 Brigade in May 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-royal-artillery-in-the-first-world-war/royal-field-artillery-brigades/|title=Royal Field Artillery Brigades|publisher=The Long, Long Trail|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it saw action at the [[Battle of Flers–Courcelette]] in September 1916, the [[Battle of Morval]] also in September 1916 and the [[Battle of Le Transloy]] in October 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wartimememoriesproject.com/greatwar/allied/fartillery.php?pid=9824|title=250 Brigade, Royal Field Artillery|publisher=Wartime Memories|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[World War I|First World War]] the drill hall became home of 72 (Northumbrian) Regiment Royal Artillery, a formation which evolved after the [[World War II|Second World War]] to become 272 (Northumbrian) Regiment Royal Artillery. On the restructuring of the Territorial Army in April 1967, the drill hall became the home of [[101st (Northumbrian) Regiment Royal Artillery]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/vols-tavr/art-eng-sig/ra101.htm |title=101st (Northumbrian) Regiment |accessdate=21 April 2014 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218045335/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/vols-tavr/art-eng-sig/ra101.htm |archivedate=December 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drill hall was converted for residential use in the early 1980s and the building is now known as Barrack Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/property-news/gallery/fancy-city-centre-living-heres-11898484|title=Fancy some city centre living?

The '''Battle of Haugsnes''' ({{Lang-is|Haugsnesbardagi}}) was fought at Haugsnes, a low peninsula south of Flugumýri in [[Skagafjörður]], Northern [[Iceland]]. The battle was fought on April 19, 1246 between the forces of [[Þórður kakali Sighvatsson]] and those of [[Gissur Þorvaldsson]]. Þórður was victorious. It was the bloodiest battle ever to be fought in [[History of Iceland|Icelandic history]], with about 110 casualties in total, amongst them [[Brandur Kolbeinsson]], chieftain of the [[Ásbirningar family clan]]. Defeat in battle led to the end of power for the Ásbirningar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northwest.is/1sogulegirstadir2.asp ''Haugsnes'' (Historical Places in Northwest Iceland)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist and farmer Sigurður Hansen of Kringlumýri created a memorial for the battle at the site, consisting of more than 1100 boulders in battle order, each representing a combatant. Those who fell are marked with iron crosses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdT1PcF0UHY Haugsnesbardagi í túninu heima (video about the memorial)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''coat of arms of Kumanovo ''' is actually an emblem. Milosh Kostadinov in 1970 wrote an article on [[municipal heraldry]] and came to the conclusion that just seven municipalities in the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] used a [[coat of arms]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://heraldika.org.mk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/MkHerald-6.pdf Macedonian Herald, Issue 6, p.4] "Heraldika"; retrieved 28 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; one of which was [[Kumanovo Municipality|Kumanovo]]. The coat of arms has been changed since Macedonian independence from the former [[Yugoslavia]].

In 2012 Jovan Jovanovski of the Macedonian Heraldic Society has described the current coat of arms as both "non-heraldic" and "quasi-heraldic".&lt;ref&gt;[http://heraldika.org.mk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/MkHerald-6.pdf Macedonian Herald, Issue 6, p.9 &amp; p.31] "Heraldika"; retrieved 28 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The Kumanovo coat of arms is placed on a so-called [[Spanish heraldry#Heraldic regulation|Spanish shield]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://heraldika.org.mk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mkherald-8.pdf Macedonian Herald, Issue 8, p.7] "Heraldika"; retrieved 28 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The shield depicts a building (the ''Zanaetchiski dom''), a statue of a woman from the [[Memorial Ossuary Kumanovo]], a yellow sun, the year 1519 (when the name Kumanovo was found in a Turkish document), the name of the town in Cyrillic script and at the bottom a single yellow tobacco leaf, all against a red background.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2459">[[File:Christian v crown.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''Crown of Christian V''']]The '''crown of [[King Christian V]]''' of Denmark was the [[Coronation crown|crown]] used at the coronation of all of Denmark's [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] kings. While the reign of such monarchs ended in 1840, the crown is still used during a Danish king's ''[[castrum doloris]]'', the last time in 1972.
Used by the kings from [[Christian V]] to [[Christian VIII]]. Made by [[Paul Kurtz in Copenhagen]], 1670–1671. Gold with enamel and table-cut stones. Total weight 2080 g. Also 2 garnets and 2 sapphires, of which the largest dates back to [[Frederick I of Denmark]].

[[Frederik III]] had large parts of his daughters' [[wikt:trousseau|trousseau]] bought in [[Paris]], which, already at that time, was a centre for European fashion. But the jewellery was commissioned to Kurtz. He was, therefore, considered an outstanding jeweller. In 1670–1671 he made his principal piece of work, '''Crown of Christian V'''. The closed shape was inspired by the crown of [[Louis XIV]] of France, but Kurtz replaced the lily-shaped points of the French crown with palmettes and adorned the crown with a row of diamonds intertwined with palmette and acanthus. In that way a "white" play of light was created, which was framed by blue and red in the sapphires and garnets of the crown ring and the orb and cross in the top.

The crown forms part of the [[Coat of arms of Denmark|National Coat of arms of Denmark]] and the [[Danish royal Coat of Arms|Royal Coat of arms]]. Since 1671, the crown has been the de facto symbol of the state power. It is included in stylized and varied forms in most state institutions, including ministries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1176">The '''Russian Customs Code''' is the law that regulates [[customs]] for [[Russia]]. The new Customs Code of the Russian Federation was adopted on May 14, 2003 to substitute the one dated back to 1993. The need to adopt a new Code arose from the problem of the development of Russian economy and foreign trade. The new Customs Code of the Russian Federation is to increase the efficiency of custom authorities through simplifying customs formalities and procedures. Tariffs are regulated by the [[Russian Customs Tariff]] document which became eligible on April 1, 2000.

'''Duchy of Ruthenia''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Велике Князівство Руське, [[Polish language|Polish]]: Księstwo Ruskie) was the project of the state as a member of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the territory of [[Kiev Voivodeship]], [[Bracław Voivodeship]] and [[Chernihiv Voivodeship]]. Its creation was proposed by [[Hetman]] [[Ivan Vyhovsky]] with [[Yuri Nemyrych]] and [[Pavlo Teteria]] in September 1658 during the negotiations between [[Cossack Hetmanate]] and Commonwealth. The project of the Duchy was approved in the first version of the [[Treaty of Hadiach]], but later, because of the strong resistance of the Polish society, the idea of the Duchy of Ruthenia was completely abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;''Т.Г. Таирова-Яковлева'' Иван Выговский // Единорогъ. Материалы по военной истории Восточной Европы эпохи Средних веков и Раннего Нового времени, вып.1, М., 2009: ''Under the influence of the Polish society and the strong dictatorship of the Vatican, the Diet in May 1659 adopted the Treaty of Hadiach in more than a truncated form. The idea of the Duchy of Ruthenia was even destroyed, as was the provision for maintaining the alliance with Moscow. The abolition of the union was canceled, as was a number of other positive articles.''&lt;/ref&gt; The Cossacks were very disappointed with the final version of the treaty and [[The Ruin (Ukrainian history)|The Ruin]] began. Yuri Nemirich, the alleged author of the Duchy of Ruthenia project, was killed in a local fight in August 1659 and Vyhovsky lost his power in October 1659, thus the project did not become a reality.&lt;ref&gt;''Наталія Яковенко'' [http://history.franko.lviv.ua/PDF%20Final/Jakovenko.pdf "Нарис історії України з найдавніших часів до кінця ХVІІІ ст."]:  "На початку серпня 1659 р. в одному зі згаданих локальних боїв на прикордонні від рук людей Цюцюри загинув 47-річний Юрій Немирич, найосвіченіший українець, аристократ і перший канцлер задуманого ним, але так і не збудованого Великого Князівства Руського."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Ad9P8rHHAP8J:krotov.info/libr_min/28_ya/ko/vleva_t.htm+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=ru&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ru Т.Г.Яковлева.

'''"Esta balada que te dou"''' ("This ballad that I give you") was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983]], performed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by [[Armando Gama]].

The song, as the title suggests, is a piano-driven ballad. Gama describes the end of a relationship, all the while dedicating "this pretty ballad" to his former lover and explaining that there is nothing wrong with being sad.

The song was performed seventeenth on the night (following [[Israel]]'s [[Ofra Haza]] with "[[Hi (Ofra Haza song)|Khay]]" and preceding [[Austria]]'s [[Westend (band)|Westend]] with "[[Hurricane (Eurovision song)|Hurricane]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 33 points, placing 13th in a field of 20.

It was succeeded as [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest|Portuguese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1984|1984 Contest]] by [[Maria Guinot]] with "[[Silêncio e tanta gente]]".

It has been covered by Os Pontos Negros in the 2009 compilation 3 Pistas - Vol.2 released by the Portuguese radio station Antena3.

'''''Front de Libération de la Côte des Somalis''''' ([[English language|English]]: ''Front for the Liberation of the Somali Coast'') was a nationalist organization, and later a guerrilla group, in the [[French Territory of the Afars and the Issas]] in present-day [[Djibouti]]. It competes with the Djibouti Liberation Movement (MLD), supported by [[Ethiopia]]. The FLCS was recognized as a national liberation movement by the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU), which participated in its financing.

==History==
The FLCS was established in 1960 by [[Mahamoud Harbi]]. Its founding president was Adan Abdulle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanation.dj/news/2007/ln76/national5.htm La Nation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; FLCS began armed activities outside Djibouti in 1968. From May of 1969, its general secretary is [[Aden Robleh Awaleh]]. In January 1970 the Front claimed an attack on the Palm in Zinc, a bar in [[Djibouti City]]. In 1975 FLCS removes the ambassador of France in [[Somalia]], Jean Guery, to be exchanged against two activists of the Front, which Omar Osman Rabeh. In December 1975, he claimed a failed attack against [[Ali Aref Bourhan]]. In February 1976, the FLCS claims the hijacking of a school bus, which ends with the death of the hostage-takers and two children. &lt;ref&gt;Abir, Mordechai. ''Oil, power and politics : conflict in Arabia, the Red Sea and the Gulf''. [[London]]: Cass, 1974. p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; The organization mainly drew its support from the [[Issa (clan)|Issa]] clan.&lt;ref name="barr"&gt;Barrington, Lowell W. (ed.). ''After independence : making and protecting the nation in postcolonial &amp; postcommunist states''. [[Ann Arbor]]: Univ. of Michigan Press, 2006. p. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt; Abdourahman Ahmed Hassan, also known as Gaboode, was made the Secretary General in 1966 after serving a two-year prison sentence. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=b9drQ9YeLxcC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=abdourahman+djibouti+independence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Wip51hOr_y&amp;sig=fD36EV3NO3WYimgPPCsycvdW7uk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAWoVChMI1a73hqqGyAIVy1oeCh0pGQBf#v=onepage&amp;q=abdourahman%20djibouti%20independence&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The FLCS' military struggle was actively supported by the government of [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="barr"/&gt; The group also received assistance from the [[OAU]] as a national liberation movement. In the 1971-1972 period, the FLCS received 1500 [[pounds sterling]] from the OAU, 0.14% of the total amount donated by the body to different African liberation movements at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gonidec, Pierre François. ''African Politics''. [[The Hague]]: Matinus Nijhoff, 1981. p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; The FLCS evolves in its demands between the request of integration in a possible "Great Somalia" or the simple independence of the territory. In 1975 FLCS approaches the African People's League for the Independence and finally opts for independence path, causing tensions with [[Mogadishu]], [[Somalia]]. At independence of the territory in 27 June 1977 FLCS 1,300 to 1,400 militants are integrated into the new Djiboutian Armed Forces, but not those of the MLD despite the request of [[Ahmed Dini]].

The helmet was first discovered by accident during 1943 at the Gjermundbu farm near [[Haugsbygd]] in the municipality of [[Ringerike (municipality)|Ringerike]] in [[Buskerud]], Norway. Officials at the [[University of Oslo]] were later notified.  Conservator [[Sverre Marstrander]] and museum assistant [[Charlotte Blindheim]] led an investigation  which confirmed the existence of a burial chamber of historic value dating from the [[Viking era]]. The Gjermundbu finds (''Gjermundbu-funnet'') contained many artifacts including  articles of weaponry. The Gjermundbu  helmet was found in nine fragments and was subsequently restored. The helmet was made of iron and was in the shape of a peaked cap made from four plates. It is now on display at the [[Museum of Cultural History, Oslo|Museum of Cultural History]] of the [[University of Oslo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  http://www.dokpro.uio.no/cgi-bin/stad/matr50|title=  Gjermbu.

Together with the [[Tjele helmet fragment]], two fragments from [[Gotland]], and one fragment from [[Kiev]], it is the only known Viking helmet capable of reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/12/22/the-only-surviving-example-of-a-complete-viking-helmet-in-existence-2/|title= The only surviving example of a complete Viking helmet in existence|publisher=   thevintagenews.com |author=  Ian Harvey

The '''Health, Development, Information and Policy Institute''' (also known as HDIP) was established in 1989 by a group of experienced researchers and health practitioners and development experts, including Dr. [[Mustafa Barghouthi]] MP, committed to improving the status of health care for all Palestinians. As an independent, non- profit Palestinian organization, HDIP specializes in policy research and planning regarding different development sectors in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]].

The institute has expanded to serve as advocates for better government policies on behalf of marginalized groups such as women, youth and the disabled. It is devoted to building a democratic Palestinian civil society. In addition, HDIP provides information services, evaluations, and training in the areas of health, development policy and system management.

==Goals==

* Contribute to the development of Palestine by addressing community needs in health, education, poverty reduction, good governance and other social areas;
* Help improve the level of coordination and cooperation between health care providers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip through information sharing and policy dialogue;
* Support other civil society organizations in lobbying for sound health and development policies and laws;
* Provide training in general management skills, systems management, rapid appraisal and research, and computer software programs; 
* Conduct evaluations of, and consultations on health, development and systems management; and
* Empower local community structures.

'''Karjala''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[lager]] type [[beer]] manufactured by the [[Hartwall]] brewery. Karjala beer was manufactured by the cooperative shop [[Osuusliike Itä-Karjala]] owned [[Sortavalan panimo Oy]] brewery from 1932 until 1944. Production was resumed in 1948.

During the 1960s, Karjala beer was already a fading brand until the [[Soviet Union]]'s ambassador to Finland, [[Andrei Kovaljov|Andrei E. Kovalev]], stated in 1968 publicly that the label of Karjala beer evoked wrong perceptions from the war times. Karjala beer's label has the [[coat of arms]] of [[Karelia]] which features an arm wielding straight western (Swedish) sword thrusting a Russian sabre wielded by another arm. The press noted the event with an article spanning 14 [[broadsheet]] pages and Karjala-beer gained new steam as a brand. Later on, a proverb stating "Karelia back, even bottle by bottle" (Karjala takaisin, vaikka pullo kerrallaan.) was formed. As excise tax class III beer gained popularity, Karjala beer got a nickname of "evacuee beer" ''evakkokalja'', especially in eastern Finland, as it will "always return", ''tulloo aina takasi''.

'''"Mata Hari"''' was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976]], performed in [[English language|English]] by [[Anne-Karine Strøm]].

The song is an up-tempo number, in which Strøm sings about the difficulties she faces in life. The cure for these, she sings, is to borrow some of the mystique of [[Mata Hari]], to whom she addresses the song. The sexual exploits of the famous woman are implied to have been considerable.

The song was performed ninth on the night, following the [[Netherlands]]' [[Sandra Reemer]] with "[[The Party's Over (Sandra Reemer song)|The Party's Over]]" and preceding [[Greece]]'s [[Mariza Koch]] with "[[Panayia Mu, Panayia Mu]]". At the close of voting, it had received 7 points, placing 18th (last) in a field of 18.

Strøm had represented Norway at Eurovision twice before, once in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] as part of vocal group The Bendik Singers and again as a solo performer in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974 Contest]].

As of 2012, Strøm still holds the record as the only artist in the history of Eurovision to have finished in last place twice.  The first time came in 1974 with the song "[[The First Day of Love]]".

Anne was succeeded as [[Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest|Norwegian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1977|1977 contest]] by [[Anita Skorgan]] with "[[Casanova (Anita Skorgan song)|Casanova]]".

The [[Principality]] of [[Andorra]] is home to folk dances like the [[contrapàs]] and [[marratxa]], which survive in [[Sant Julià de Lòria]] especially. Andorran folk music has similarities to the music in nearby regions of France and Spain, but is especially [[music of Catalonia|Catalan]] in character, especially in the presence of dances like the [[sardana]]. Other Andorran folk dances include [[contrapàs]] in [[Andorra la Vella]] and [[Saint Anne's dance]] in [[Escaldes-Engordany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=FEVA |title=For Culture Lovers |url=http://www.feva.ad/Andorra/Angles/Andorra03_culture.htm |accessdate=September 28, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041115093936/http://www.feva.ad/Andorra/Angles/Andorra03_culture.htm |archivedate=November 15, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radio Nacional d’Andorra]] runs both [[Radio Andorra]] and the music station [[Andorra Música]].

Music festivals in Andorra include the [[ChamJam Music Festival]], [[Ordino]] and the jazz [[Escaldes-Engordany International Jazz Festival]]. Violinist [[Gérard Claret]] is the director of the [[Young National Orchestra of Cambra d'Andorra]].

The [[national anthem]] of Andorra is "[[El Gran Carlemany]]" (''Great [[Charlemagne]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andorra|work=National Anthem Reference Page|accessdate=September 28, 2005 |url=http://david.national-anthems.net/ad.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted on 8 September 1914, the [[feast day]] of Andorra's [[patron saint]], the [[Virgin of Meritxell]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The [[progressive metal]] band [[Persefone]] is one of the most notable music groups to originate from Andorra.

==Eurovision==
{{main|Andorra in the Eurovision Song Contest}}
Andorra (through national broadcaster [[Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra|RTVA]]) has participated in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] on only six occasions, from 2004 until 2009. In 2004, Spaniard [[Marta Roure]]'s "[[Jugarem A Estimar-Nos]]" was the first [[Catalan language]] entrant to the Eurovision Song Contest. Andorra did not progress beyond the semi-finals in any of its six attempts; its best result was in 2007, when punk band [[Anonymous (band)|Anonymous]] and the song "[[Salvem el món]]" finished 12th among 28 countries in the semi-final. Andorra decided to withdraw from the 2010 edition due to lack of funding from the TV station's shareholders and due to spending cuts within the network, and has not returned.

The '''Roman Catholic Diocese of Verdun''' ([[Latin]]: ''Dioecesis Virodunensis''; [[French language|French]]: ''Diocèse de Verdun'') is a [[diocese]] of the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in France. Currently a [[Suffragan bishop|suffragan]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Besançon|Archdiocese of Besançon]], the diocese corresponds to the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]] in the [[Regions of France|Region]] of [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]. The diocese is subdivided into 577 parishes.

==History==
The diocese dates back to the 4th century.  Traditionally the city was first evangelized around 332 by [[St. Sanctinus]], Bishop of [[Meaux]], who became the first bishop. Sanctinus erected the first Christian oratory dedicated to [[St. Peter]] and [[St. Paul]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les grands sites religieux du diocèse de Verdun au Moyen-Âge|url=http://catholique-verdun.cef.fr/spip/spip.php?article233&amp;var_recherche=saintin|work=Diocèse de Verdun}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Healy|first=Patrick|title=The Chronicle of Hugh of Flavigny: Reform and the Investiture Contest in the Late Eleventh Century|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5526-8|url=http://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=637&amp;calcTitle=1&amp;isbn=9780754655268&amp;lang=cy-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.22–23}}

"Other bishops worthy of mention are: St. Possessor (470–486); St. Firminus (486–502); [[Vitonus|St. Vitonus (Vanne)]] (502–529); St. Désiré (Desideratus) (529–554), [[Agericus of Verdun|St. Agericus (Airy)]] (554–591), friend of St. [[Gregory of Tours]] and of Fortunatus; [[Paulus of Verdun|St. Paul]] (630–648), formerly Abbot of the Benedictine Monastery of [[Tholey]] in the Diocese of Trier; and St. Madalvaeus (Mauve) (753–776)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diocese of Verdun|url=http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/v/verdun,diocese_of.html|work=CatholiCity|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1801 Verdun was part of the [[ecclesiastical province]] of the [[Archbishop of Trier]].  On November 29, 1801 it was suppressed and added to the [[Diocese of Nancy]]. On October 6, 1822 the diocese was re-established.

'''[[Scouting]] in the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]]''' is maintained by a single troop of [[Argentina|Argentinian]] Scouts and also by visiting Scouts from other nations who are participating in [[List of Antarctic expeditions|expedition]]s and research projects.

==The permanent Scout Group== 
The southernmost Scout unit of the world, the ''Grupo Scouts 1556 "Esperanza Blanca"'', is at the [[Esperanza Base]] at the tip of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]; it is affiliated to the [[Scouts de Argentina]]. Originally, the group belonged to the ''Asociación Diocesana de Scouts Católicos Argentinos Castrense'' (Diocesan Association of the Catholic Scouts of Argentina - Military Diocese), an independent Scout organization with links to the [[Union Internationale des Guides et Scouts d'Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marambio.aq/scoutsesperanza2011.html |title=Grupo Scouts 1556 "Esperanza Blanca"  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=www.marambio.aq |publisher=Fundación Marambio |access-date=28 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scouts participating in Antarctic expeditions==
[[Charles Hoadley]], who founded one of the first Scout Groups in [[Footscray, Victoria]], [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;Williamstown Advertiser 8 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  was a member of the [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]] led by Sir [[Douglas Mawson]] from 1911–14. Hoadley was a member of the [[Western Base Party]]. [[Cape Hoadley]] was named after him upon discovery by the exploration party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/History/biography/hoadley_charles.htm Coolantarctica Biography of Hoadley]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James William Slessor Marr]] was one of two [[The Scout Association|British Scouts]] who were selected from 1,700 Scouting applicants to accompany Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]] on the 1921 [[Shackleton–Rowett Expedition]]. The expedition was curtailed following the death of Shackleton, but Marr later joined the 1929 [[British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition]]. The other Scout, Norman Mooney, left the expedition ''en route'' due to illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scoutguidehistoricalsociety.com/marr.htm |title=Scouting Milestones - Scout Marr and the Quest |last=Walker |first=Colin |date= |website=scoutguidehistoricalsociety.com |publisher=Scout and Guide Historical Society |access-date=27 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Siple]] took part in two [[Richard Evelyn Byrd|Byrd expeditions]] of 1928 to 1930 and 1933 to 1935, representing the [[Boy Scouts of America]] as an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].&lt;ref name="SipleEagle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.south-pole.com/p0000111.htm |quote= Paul Allman Siple saw the first light of day on December 18, 1908, in Montpelier, Ohio. ...|title=Paul A. Siple |publisher=South-Pole.com |accessdate =2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BSA Antarctic Scientific Program===
Following the example of Paul Siple, Eagle Scout Richard Chappell was selected to join the researchers of the [[United States Antarctic Program]] to mark [[International Geophysical Year]] in 1957-58. Mark Lienmiller was similarly selected to go to the Antarctic in 1978 for the 50th anniversary of Byrd's 1928 expedition. This was repeated in 1985 when Doug Barnhart was selected. These placements proved so successful that the [[National Science Foundation]] announced that once every three years, the [[National Science Foundation]] would sponsor an "Antarctic Scout" to join the Antarctic Program commencing in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Butterworth |first=W E |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Scouting at the Bottom of the World |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vWYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%2250th+Anniversary%22+antarctic+scout+program&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVj6vRpeXRAhWJSBQKHYsaBwMQ6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%2250th%20Anniversary%22%20antarctic%20scout%20program&amp;f=false |journal=Boys' Life |volume= |issue=October 1985 |pages=32–33 |doi= |access-date=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of "providing students with opportunities to participate in research activities outside the college or university setting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/BoyScouts/AntarcticScientificProgram.aspx#pas |title=BSA Antarctic Scientific Program |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=www.scouting.org |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |access-date=28 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scouting Antarctic expeditions==
Three Scouts of [[Scouts Australia]], [[Ian Brown (Scouting)|Ian Brown]], [[Keith Williams (Scouting)|Keith Williams]], and [[Peter Treseder]], were the first [[Australians]] to walk unaided to the [[South Pole]], and stood at the Pole with the [[World Scout flag]] on [[New Year's Day]] 1998. It took them 60 days to reach the Pole, pulling all their food and gear with them. "We gained our zest for adventure in Scouts. Scouting is fun and you learn to adventure safely," they said in a message broadcast from Antarctica to Scouts at the 1997/98 [[Australian Scout Jamboree]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 17 World Organization of the Scout Movement – Triennial Report 1996-1999&lt;/ref&gt;

A projected expedition organised by [[Scouting in South East England#Hampshire Scout County|Hampshire Scout Expeditions]] in the United Kingdom is planned for 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antarctica 2018|url=http://hsx.org.uk/expeditions/antarctica-2018/|website=hsx.org.uk|publisher=HSX|accessdate=26 March 2017|date=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of [[skiing]] 700 miles (1130 kilometres) from the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole in 60 days and then kite ski the return journey. The four-man team, three of whom will be under 25 years-old, will have completed training in Scotland, the [[French Alps]], Norway and Greenland before the start of the expedition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://connects.soton.ac.uk/feature/southampton-academic-to-lead-hampshire-scouts-on-first-ever-expedition-to-antarctica/ |title=Southampton Academic to Lead Hampshire Scouts on First Ever Expedition to Antarctica |last=Robinson |first=Ollie |date= |website=connects.soton.ac.uk |publisher=University of Southampton |access-date=28 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Serpula vermicularis''''', known by [[common name]]s including the '''calcareous tubeworm''', '''fan worm''', '''plume worm''' or '''red tube worm''', is a [[species]] of segmented marine [[polychaete]] worm in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Serpulidae]]. It is the [[type species]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Serpula]]'' and was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in 1767. It lives in a tube into which it can retract.&lt;ref name=WallaWalla/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Serpula vermicularis.jpg|thumb|left|Calcareous tubes of ''S. vermicularis'']]
''Serpula vermicularis'' lives in a calcareous tube which is attached to a rock, boulder or other hard surface. The tube is often curved, but is not tightly coiled as in some other related species. It can grow to a length of {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}}, but is usually shorter than this. The anterior part of the worm protrudes from the tube and has a plume of about 40 feather-like radioles projecting from the second segment, or peristomium, which also houses the two eyes and the mouth. The radioles are bi[[pinnate]] and covered with fine [[cilia]]. They are commonly red, orange or pink and are usually banded with white. A funnel-shaped lid or [[Operculum (animal)|operculum]] covers the entrance to the tube when the animal retracts inside. This lid has up to 160 fine creases around its edge and is symmetrical and usually red. It is sometimes divided into two. The yellow-coloured body has seven thoracic segments and up to 190 abdominal segments which are protected by the tube. At least four segments with [[seta]]e (bristles) are found in the thoracic region.&lt;ref name=WallaWalla&gt;[http://www.wallawalla.edu/academics/departments/biology/rosario/inverts/Annelida/Serpulidae/Serpula_vermicularis.html ''Serpula vermicularis'' Linnaeus, 1767] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002000012/http://www.wallawalla.edu/academics/departments/biology/rosario/inverts/Annelida/Serpulidae/Serpula_vermicularis.html |date=2011-10-02 }} Walla Walla University. Retrieved 2011-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
''Serpula vermicularis'' is [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] in distribution. It is found in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and the European seaboard of the Atlantic Ocean, but not on the North American coast. It occurs in the intertidal zone and at depths down to {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=WallaWalla/&gt; Also along Southern African coast from Olifant's River to Maputo.&lt;ref name="Branch 2010"&gt;Branch, G.M., Branch, M.L, Griffiths, C.L. and Beckley, L.E. (2010). ''Two Oceans: a guide to the marine life of southern Africa'' Struik Nature, Cape Town. {{ISBN|978 1 77007 772 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
''Serpula vermicularis'' grows on hard substrates. It favours shells of [[Bivalvia|bivalves]], boulders and man-made structures. Around the United Kingdom, juveniles were found to be plentiful growing on the [[bryozoa]]n, ''[[Flustra foliacea]]''. Large colonies sometimes form, but these are seldom on rocks. Larvae may settle on the tubes of other worms and their subsequent development can form reefs. These reefs are very fragile and often break up. This is sometimes due to the activity of certain boring sponges, such as ''[[Cliona celata]]'' (red boring sponge).&lt;ref name=UKMarine&gt;[http://www.ukmarinesac.org.uk/biogenic-reefs.htm Biogenic Reefs] UK Marine SAC's Project. Retrieved 2011-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
The tube of ''S. vermicularis'' is made from [[calcite]] and [[aragonite]]. [[Calcium]] for its manufacture is stored in two white sacs on the ventral side of the peristomium. The tube is fabricated by the glandular ventral shields on the other thoracic segments, where calcium is mixed with an organic secretion to make a paste. This is formed into shape by a collar found just behind the first segment, the [[prostomium]].&lt;ref name=WallaWalla/&gt;

''Serpula vermicularis'' is a [[filter feeder]] and extends its radioles to catch [[phytoplankton]] and [[detritus]]. The radioles also act as gills. Blood is pumped in and out of these with the flow direction alternating in a single set of vessels. The blood is then pumped through a ventral blood vessel to the tip of the abdomen before returning through a sinus adjoining the gut.&lt;ref name=WallaWalla/&gt;

The blood of ''S. vermicularis'' contains the oxygen-binding pigment [[chlorocruorin]]. As well as transporting oxygen to the tissues, this binds [[carbon monoxide]] much more efficiently than does human [[haemoglobin]]. This may be the reason why the worm may settle and grow on brown seaweeds such as ''[[Fucus]]'', but avoids giant kelp, ''[[Nereocystis]]''. The latter uses carbon monoxide to inflate its pneumocysts, and this would be toxic to the worm.&lt;ref name=WallaWalla/&gt;

==Life cycle==
In the United Kingdom, spawning takes place between June and September. The larvae form part of the plankton for up to two months before settling on the seabed. Growth is fairly rapid with tubes extending by 1&amp;nbsp;cm (0.4&amp;nbsp;in) in a month. The worms mature in about 10 months and may live for several years.&lt;ref name=UKMarine/&gt;

==Ecology==
Coldwater reefs built up by ''S. vermicularis'' take many years to develop and provide a hard substrate which other organisms use. The reefs around the United Kingdom support a diverse community of sessile invertebrates, including [[Porifera|sponges]], [[hydroid (zoology)|hydroids]], [[Ascidiacea|ascidians]], [[bryozoa]]ns, the worm ''[[Pomatoceros triqueter]]'',  the sea anemone ''[[Metridium senile]]'' and bivalves such as [[Chlamys (bivalve)|''Chlamys'' spp.]], ''[[Modiolus modiolus]]'' and [[queen scallop]], ''Aequipecten opercularis''. Macrofauna include crabs such as ''[[Cancer pagurus]]'', the sea urchins ''[[Echinus esculentus]]'' and ''[[Psammechinus miliaris]]'', the brittle star ''[[Ophiothrix fragilis]]'', the starfish ''[[Asterias rubens]]'' and the whelk ''[[Buccinum undatum]]''. [[Red algae]] grow on the reef in shallow water. The [[tunicate]] ''[[Pyura microcosmus]]'' occurs on these reefs, but is seldom seen in other habitats. A large number of [[Crypsis|cryptic]] species of [[microfauna]] shelter among the tubes.&lt;ref name=UKMarine/&gt;

[[Predation|Predators]] of the worm include [[sea urchin]]s, [[starfish]], and the [[wrasse]]s ''[[Crenilabrus melops]]'' and ''[[Ctenolabrus rupestris]]''.&lt;ref name=UKMarine/&gt;

'''''The Blu Ribbon Revolution: Co-creating a World Beyond Poverty''''' (ISBN 978 - 93 - 5053 - 306 - 2) is a book by the Winner of the 2012 Dubai Cares Award and community activist [[Viswanathan Manikan]].

The book looks into the aspect of [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] (CSR) as a tool for measured efforts towards [[poverty reduction|poverty alleviation]] while aligning business objectives. In the book Manikan strikes a contrast between excessive wealth vis-à-vis stark poverty and inadequate resource distribution across globally deprived regions.

Insights into major developmental and relief efforts across governments, multi-lateral organizations, [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO’s), and individuals are accentuated. But the main highlight of the book is CSR and its far reaching and sustainable practices that have brought about measurable changes and improved conditions across economic zones.

==Abstract==

The Blu Ribbon Revolution starts off by addressing key issues of poverty particularly in [[least developed countries]] (LDCs). Manikan further discusses the causes of poverty with historical ramifications and progressively highlights alleviations efforts. The book divided in four phases concludes with the importance of CSR, case studies and provides an easily implementable CSR business framework.

==How Poor Are the Poor==

While the [[luxury market]] booms Manikan states the richest nations with wealth above US$100,000 per adult in 2010, were found in North America, Western Europe, and the rich Asian-Pacific and Middle East countries. In contrast to these statistics were figures that state that almost 50 percent of the population in LDCs lives on less than $1 a day.

The book puts forth the appalling conditions, issues of malnutrition, rates of [[infant mortality]], diseases, economic and social factors and poverty traps in the regions of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], Middle Eastern and North Africa [[MENA]], [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean and [[South Asia]] (India and Bangladesh).The UN [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), [[Purchasing power parity]] (PPP) and [[Gini coefficient]] in these regions are some of the factors that have been taken into consideration.

Manikan discusses how HDI is lowest in [[Africa]] putting forth poverty parameters in [[Horn of Africa]]. Even though HDI were lower in these regions poverty in itself has varied repercussions. The author mentions the Report of the State of Food Insecurity in the World (1999) that estimated India alone with more undernourished people (204 million) than all of sub-Saharan Africa combined.

==Causes of Poverty==

The origins of poverty have been classified as historical, environmental, social, cultural and political each with its own impact. Colonialism, slavery, war, and conquest have led to long term impacts globally but most of all in African and Asian nations.

In terms of Environmental causes, nature plays a vital role as harvests from forests, fisheries, and farms are a primary source of rural income and a fallback when other sources of employment falter. However the author highlights environmental imbalance can be disastrous as the nature of poverty is largely rural. UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out that, in the world’s poorest countries, more than 75 percent of the population lives in rural areas and depends on agriculture for work and income. Any environmental adversity in such a case can be have long term consequences.

[[File:Viswanthan Manikan in Big Pen School in Nairobi.JPG|thumb|Viswanthan Manikan at the Big Pen School in Nairobi]]

The Multidimensional nature of poverty can be assessed by the fact that Manikan states that 80 percent of the world’s population lives in countries where income differentials have widened. The UNDP’s 2007 Human Development Report highlights this in the book with an estimate that the poorest 40 percent of the world’s population account for only 5 percent of global income. On the other hand, the richest 20 percent account for 75 percent of world income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Development Reports|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering economic factors such as half the world’s workforce toiling in unstable, insecure jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global data on proportion of employable working age population|url=http://www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manikan states children, especially girls, suffer major health and education setbacks. He states it would be well worth to ponder the fact that statistics state around 24,000 children die every day from preventable causes – many from diseases like measles, diphtheria, and tetanus.

Political factors such as unrest can also to lead to poverty issues such as displacement. The author mentions that Southern and Western Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are home to the largest populations of refugees. By the end of 2010 more than 43 million people were displaced by conflict or persecution, both within and outside the borders of their own countries as per UN HCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also discusses the role of women in politics. As per the statistics quoted in 2008 women held at least 40 percent of the seats in five parliaments: Rwanda leads the way at 48.8 percent, followed by Sweden (47 percent), Cuba (43.2 percent), Finland (41.5 percent), and Argentina (40 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Millennium Development Goals Report|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/2008highlevel/pdf/newsroom/mdg%20reports/MDG_Report_2008_ENGLISH.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author covers views of economists and historians on creating measures for poverty and the complexities that follow.

==Alleviation Avenues==

The author talks about Alleviation avenues by first mentioning noted economist and poverty activist [[Jeffery Sachs]] and his theory of clinical economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jeffsachs.org/books/the-end-of-poverty/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of national governments and their adherence to [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) proposed Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) framework as per [[Highly Indebted Poor Countries]] (HIPC) Initiative have been discussed in-depth in chosen nations. Poverty alleviation programmes are classified into (i) selfemployment programmes, (ii) wage employment programmes, (iii) food security programmes, (iv) social security programmes, and (v) urban poverty alleviation programmes. 
[[File:Cambodia project carrying stones.JPG|thumb|left|Manikan carrying stones as a part of the Cambodia project]]

Central to the theme of poverty reduction have been the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]]. The framework of eight goals, eighteen targets, and forty-eight indicators have been studied along with efforts by United Nations member bodies and international organizations.

The author talks about the growth of international NGO community falling within the broad framework of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs). Manikan mentions that their partnership with [[United Nations]] has been active since 1947 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrol.org/article.aspx?article_id=23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511064926/http://unrol.org/article.aspx?article_id=23|archivedate=2013-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and humanitarian work has been the core objective of some of the biggest NGO's such as Oxfam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; CARE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.care.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; World Vision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvision.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Save the Children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savethechildren.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book looks at the extraordinary work of these along with the work of organizations such as The Green Belt Movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbeltmovement.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hunger Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thp.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dubai Cares]], Dubai International Humanitarian Aid and Development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dihad.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;(DIHAD), Promoting Education, emPowering Youth’s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pepycambodia.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; (PEPY’s), The Dhaka Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedhakaproject.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Room to Read,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roomtoread.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ACF (Action Contre la Faim) International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actioncontrelafaim.org/en/content/acf-international}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the larger gamut of humanitarian efforts the author also illustrates the role of social entrepreneurs, change makers and philanthropists.

==Corporate Social Responsibility==

The Credit Suisse global wealth pyramid &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.credit-suisse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an indicator of the state of poverty in terms of percentage. Manikan suggests understanding each of the four tiers of the pyramid to get a deeper understanding of how CSR takes precedence over the mere act of charity while attending to 68.4% (in 2010) of the global poor. He suggests corporate social responsibility is a phrase that marketers and economists use; it has filtered down to represent the virtue of a company and its motives in community management.

A rigorous literature review of CSR ideologies and frameworks suggested by noted economists and poverty activists have been studied. [[The Wealth of Nations]] by eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher Adam Smith, the Bowen Effect and evolution of CSR from 1950s have been discussed. This brings forth the pivotal CSR debate on whether businesses have the sole purpose of making profits increasing shareholder wealth or must businesses consider comprehensive stakeholders while giving back to the society at large.

An evolution of CSR across the world, case studies and the UN Global Compact&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unglobalcompact.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been discussed to bring about the benefits of a strategic CSR engagement. Manikan finally proposes that CSR in the true sense aids in adherence to wider stakeholder interests while creating a balance between business goals and societal obligations. He highlights different aspects of CSR, frameworks suggested by noted CSR practitioners and illustrates his own strategic CSR framework for organizations taking onto account the five different aspects of Environmental, Economic, Philanthropic, Ethical and Legal CSR.

As a parting note Manikan suggests in essence, organizations today need to adapt to changing leadership requirements effectively implementing CSR strategies for growth and sustainability.

Timidria was formed in 1991 and the name means 'solidarity' in [[Tamazheq language (disambiguation)|Tamajaq]]. Niger's government denies the existence of slavery in the country, but international [[human rights]] organizations estimate the number of slaves in Niger at approximately 40,000.

The headquarters of Timidria is in the capital [[Niamey]], and the organization has offices all around the country, helping escaped slaves to build up a new life in freedom.
