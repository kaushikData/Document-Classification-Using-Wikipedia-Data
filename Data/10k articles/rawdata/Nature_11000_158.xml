*Alcinoe, a [[naiad]], and one of the ''nymphai Lykaaides'' ([[nymphs]] of Mount [[Lykaion|Lykaios]] in [[Arkadia]]). Her parents possibly were [[Oceanus]] and [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]].

*Alcinoe, daughter of King [[Polybus of Corinth|Polybus]] of [[Corinth]] and Periboea. She became the wife of Amphilochus, son of [[Dryas (mythology)|Dryas]]. Alcinoe refused to pay the full wages to Nicandra, a weaver she had hired, and the woman prayed to [[Athena]] to avenge her. The goddess afflicted Alcinoe with a passion for [[Xanthus (mythology)|Xanthus]] of [[Samos Island|Samos]] and she left her husband and children and ran away with him. Coming to her senses in the middle of the voyage, she wept bitter tears and threw herself into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Parthenius of Nicaea]], ''Love Stories'', 27&lt;/ref&gt;
*Alcinoe, a daughter of [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]], and a granddaughter of [[Perseus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5912">The [[Bible]] names over 120 [[species]] of [[animal]]s by current interpretive standards.  The more a particular animal abounded in the [[Holy Land]], the more frequent allusions to it may be found.

==Species mentioned==
A closer examination of the way in which references to animals are introduced, the frequency of allusions to certain species, and the date of the documents in which they are found gives a fair idea of the conditions of the area at different stages of its history.  The species, for instance, called in [[Hebrew]] 're'em', was very probably the [[aurochs]], or wild [[ox]] and totally disappeared about the time of the [[Babylonian captivity]].  The wild [[Donkey|ass]], the [[lion]] and a few others long ago became [[extinct]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].  Other species alluded to in the Bible are now extremely scarce.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia |wstitle=Animals in the Bible |volume=1 |first=Charles Léon |last=Souvay|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible mentions animals from varying regions of the [[Middle East]].  The [[ostrich]], for instance, a denizen of the torrid regions, and the [[camel]], of the waterless districts around Palestine, are mentioned side by side with the [[Roe Deer|roebuck]] and [[deer]] of the woody summits of [[Lebanon]].  This variety, greater probably in Palestine than in any other country in the same [[latitude]], is attributed to the great extremes of [[elevation]] and [[temperature]] in this small area. Palestinian [[fauna]] is not as rich today as it was during the [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Biblical times]]. The land is barren today but was well wooded when the Bible was written, especially on the hills east of the [[Jordan River]].&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

Recent excavations in the [[Timna Valley]] discovered what may be the earliest camel bones found in Israel or even outside the Arabian peninsula, dating to around 930 BCE. This is seen as evidence that the stories of [[Abraham]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], [[Jacob]] and [[Esau]] were written after this time.&lt;ref name=camels&gt;{{cite news|last=Hasson|first=Nir|title=Hump stump solved: Camels arrived in region much later than biblical reference|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/.premium-1.569091|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=Haaretz|date=Jan 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sapir-Hen|first=Lidar|author2=Erez Ben-Yosef|title=The Introduction of Domestic Camels to the Southern Levant: Evidence from the Aravah Valley|journal=Tel Aviv|year=2013|volume=40|pages=277–285|url=http://archaeology.tau.ac.il/ben-yosef/pub/Pub_PDFs/Sapir-Hen&amp;Ben-Yosef13_CamelAravah_TelAviv.pdf|accessdate=16 February 2014|doi=10.1179/033443513x13753505864089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification of animals==
Although no regular classification is to be sought for in the Bible, animal creation is there practically divided into four classes, often called kinds,&lt;ref&gt;"after his kind, whose seed [is] in itself, upon the earth" - Genesis 1:11&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed||date=April 2015}} according to the four different modes of [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]].  Among the animals, some walk, others fly, many are essentially swimmers and several crawl on the ground.  This classification, more [[Empirical|empiric]] than [[logical]], would not by any means satisfy a modern [[scientist]].  It must be known, however, if we wish fairly to understand the language of the Scriptures on the matters connected therewith.  The first class, the beasts, in the Biblical parlance, includes all large, walking animals, with the exception of the [[amphibia]], such small animals as [[Mole (animal)|mole]]s, [[mouse|mice]] and the like,&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; and humans as they were not classified as animals.

Beasts are divided into [[cattle]], or domesticated (behemoth in the strict sense), and beasts of the field, i.e. [[wild animal]]s.  The [[fowl]]s, which constitute the second class, include not only the [[bird]]s, but also "all things that fly", even if they "go upon four feet", as the different kinds of [[locust]]s.  Of the many "living beings that swim in the water" no particular species is mentioned; the "great [[whale]]s" are set apart in that class, while the rest are divided according to whether they have, or have not, [[fin]]s and [[Scale (zoology)|scale]]s ([[Leviticus]] 11:9, 10).&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

The [[reptile]]s, or "creeping things", form the fourth class.  References to this class are relatively few.  However, it should be noticed that the "creeping things"&lt;ref&gt;"and there were in it all kinds of four-footed animals and crawling creatures of the earth and birds of the air" - Acts 10:12&lt;/ref&gt; include not only the reptiles properly so called, but also all short-legged animals or [[insect]]s which seem to crawl rather than to walk, such as moles, [[lizard]]s, etc.  From a religious viewpoint, all these animals are divided into two classes, [[Clean animals|clean]] and [[Unclean animals|unclean]], according to whether they can, or cannot, [[Kashrut|be eaten]].&lt;ref&gt;Moses, et al. The Bible. Jerusalem:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

Appearing to radiate from the Sun, crepuscular rays usually look much brighter than anticrepuscular rays. This is because the atmospheric [[light scattering by particles|light scattering]] making the crepuscular rays visible occurs at low angles to the horizon (see [[Mie theory]]).

Although anticrepuscular rays appear to converge toward the [[antisolar point]], the convergence is actually an [[optical illusion]]. The rays are in fact almost parallel, and their apparent convergence is toward a [[vanishing point]], which is an infinite distance away from the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[English folklore]] the '''asrai''' is a type of [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] [[fairy]] that lives in seas and lakes and is similar to the [[mermaid]] and [[Neck (water spirit)|nixie]]. They are sometimes described as timid and shy, standing between two and four feet tall, or may be depicted as tall and lithe.&lt;ref name=Froud&gt;Froud, Brian and Lee, Alan (2002). ''Faeries''. Pavilion Books. {{ISBN|1-86205-558-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Tales from [[Cheshire]] and [[Shropshire]] tell of a fisherman who captured an asrai and put it in his boat. It seemed to plead for its freedom in an unknown language, and when the fisherman bound it the touch of its cold wet hands burned his skin like fire, leaving a permanent mark. He covered the asrai with wet weeds, and it continued to protest, its voice getting fainter and fainter. By the time the fisherman reached the shore the asrai had melted away leaving nothing but a puddle of water in the boat &lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Katharine (1976). ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies''. Pantheon Books. pp. 10–11. {{ISBN|0394409183}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tongue, Ruth (1970). ''Forgotten Folk-Tales of the English Counties''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul. pp. 24–26. {{ISBN|0710068336}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for it will perish if directly exposed too long to the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Katharine (1978). ''The Vanishing People: Fairy Lore and Legends''. Pantheon Books. p. 81. {{ISBN|0394502485}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their inability to survive daylight is similar to that of [[troll]]s from [[Scandinavian folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindow, John (2014). ''Trolls: An Unnatural History''. Reaktion Books. p. 40. {{ISBN|9781780232898}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tales describe the asrai as having green hair and a fishtail instead of legs&lt;ref name=Kerven/&gt; or may instead have webbed feet.&lt;ref name=Arrow&gt;Arrowsmith, Nancy (2009) [1977]. ''Field Guide to the Little People''. Llewellyn. p. 56. {{ISBN|9780738715490}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They live for hundreds of years and will come up to the surface of the water once each century to bathe in the moonlight which they use to help them grow. If the asrai (usually depicted as female) sees a man she will attempt to lure him with promises of gold and jewels into the deepest part of the lake to drown or simply to trick him. However, she cannot tolerate human coarseness and vulgarity, and this will be enough to frighten her away.&lt;ref name=Kerven&gt;Kerven, Rosalind (2008). ''English Fairy Tales and Legends''. National Trust Books. pp. 120–123, 186–188. {{ISBN|1-905400-65-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and Origin==

The etymology of the word asrai is unknown. "Ashray" is sometimes given as a spelling variant.

Their oldest known appearance in print was the poem "The Asrai" by [[Robert Williams Buchanan]], first published in April 1872, and followed by a sequel, "A Changeling: A Legend of the Moonlight."&lt;ref name=Buchanan&gt;Buchanan, Robert Williams (1884). ''The Poetical Works of Robert Buchanan''. Chatto &amp; Windus. pp. 201-204.&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan described them as nature-loving spirits who could not bear sunlight.

The second known mention of the asrai, and the first to explicitly describe them as beings from folklore, was Ruth Tongue's account in ''Forgotten Folk-Tales of the English Counties'' (1970). Tongue was an influential folklorist, but her accuracy has been called into question. She claimed to have grown up in Somerset, where she gathered most of her research, but this claim was later disproven. In "A Dictionary of English Folklore," Jacqueline Simpson  and Stephen Roud state that "in ''Forgotten Folktales'' she gives only the vaguest hints as to where, when, and from whom she had obtained the stories; any notes she may have made at the time were lost in moves and fires."&lt;ref name="Simpson and Roud"&gt;Simpson, Jacqueline, and Stephen Roud (2000). ''A Dictionary of English Folklore.'' Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flexjet.jpg|thumb]]
A '''bottom crawler''' is an [[underwater]] exploration and recovery vehicle. It is designed to sink to the bottom of a body of water, where it moves about using traction against the bottom with [[wheel]]s or [[Continuous track|tracks]]. It is usually tethered to a surface ship by cables providing power, control, video, and lifting capabilities, but this is not essential.

Such devices have been proposed for use in recovering deep seabed minerals, such as [[manganese nodules]].

These also have been considered since the late 1960s for use in offshore [[oil exploration]] and production in extremely deep water, but practical devices have used other technologies from the sea surface, such as moored barges and [[tension leg platform]]s.

[[File:Louisiana wetlands aerial view.jpg|thumb|397x397px|Overhead view of Louisiana wetlands.]]Wetland chemistry is largely affected by dredging, which can be done for a variety of purposes.

Wetlands undergo different chemical reactions depending on a variety of parameters, including salinity and pH. [[Redox|Redox reactions]] have a major effect on wetland ecosystems, as they depend heavily on salinity, pH, oxygen availability, and others. Common redox reactions in wetland include [[carbon cycle|carbon]], nitrogen, and sulfur transformations. Fluctuations in water flow and flooding can change the abundance of the oxidized or reduced species depending on the environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Increased flooding and water flow can also change the availability of nutrients to local species.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vymazal|first=J|year=2007|title=Removal of nutrients in various types of constructed wetlands|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969706007212|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=380|pages=48–65|via=ScienceDirect|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2006.09.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The further the wetlands change from their original states, the more difficult rebuilding land becomes. The types of [[Environmental mitigation|mitigation]] efforts also change depending on the chemistry, so an understanding of the change is required for effective mitigation.

== Wetlands ==

=== Definition ===
Wetlands are areas of land submerged in water near both [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] systems. They are highly diverse and are classified by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] into five categories: “The term wetland includes a variety of areas that fall into one of five categories: (1) areas with [[Aquatic plant|hydrophytes]] and hydric soils, such as those commonly known as marshes, swamps, and bogs; (2) areas without hydrophytes but with hydric soils - for example, flats where drastic fluctuation in water level, wave action, turbidity, or high concentration of salts may prevent the growth of hydrophytes; (3) areas with hydrophytes but nonhydric soils, such as margins of impoundments or excavations where hydrophytes have become established but hydric soils have not yet developed; (4) areas without soils but with hydrophytes such as the seaweed-covered portion of rocky shores; and (5) wetlands without soil and without hydrophytes, such as gravel beaches or rocky shores without vegetation”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Wetlands can also be classified based on salinity, a type of classification often referenced in research where salinity is a major factor. These classifications are often referred to in parts per thousand (ppt) and include freshwater (0-2 ppt), intermediate (2-10 ppt), brackish (10-20 ppt), and saltwater (20+ ppt).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americaswetlandresources.com/background_facts/detailedstory/types_wetlands.html|title=America's WETLAND: Resource Center|website=www.americaswetlandresources.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance of wetlands ===
Wetlands are sources of extreme [[biodiversity]] and ecological benefit. They contain a multitude of species of plants and animals, including 79 species classified as rare, threatened, or [[endangered species|endangered]]. An estimate by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] indicates that wetlands provide for, directly and indirectly, up to 43% of federally threatened or endangered species.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Wetlands are the leading producer of oysters, 50% of the shrimp crop, 75% of the alligator harvest, 27% of the oil and gas, and the [[Port of South Louisiana|largest port complex in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americaswetlandresources.com/background_facts/basicfacts/FAQs.html|title=FAQ's|website=www.americaswetlandresources.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world’s wetlands have an estimated worth of $14.9 trillion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Wetlands also provide for disaster protection, including surge protection from hurricanes, as they and [[barrier island]]s help to break down the power of a storm before it reaches mainland. They also provide flood relief, as they are able to hold about three-acre feet (one million gallons) of water.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This holding of water allows for rejuvenation of ecosystems, as new sediment is able to settle. Flooding also affects factors such as root penetration, soil temperature, conductivity, and bulk density.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Wetlands are highly effective at removing pollutants and excess nutrients due to the slow water flow and absorption by the plant systems. This has been shown to be effective in the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus, the major nutrients involved in “dead zones”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They are also major sinks for heavy metals and sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://water.usgs.gov/nwsum/WSP2425/hydrology.html|title=History of Wetlands in the Conterminous United States|website=water.usgs.gov|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Digging the Cape Cod Canal -- Dredge Gov. Warfield.jpg|thumb|An example of a canal being dredged.]]

=== Dredging ===
[[Dredging]] is the removal of sediment, plant species, and debris from an aquatic area. Industry, travel, and recreation throughout wetlands often requires the dredging of [[canal]]s, especially by oil industry to get out to their offshore drills through coastal wetlands. Canals widen after being dredged because of the increased water flow and loss of plant life, both attributing to increased erosion. It is estimated that there are 4,572 miles of canals south of the [[Intracoastal Waterway]], not including Lake Ponchartrain and Lake Maurepas, and that canals alone attribute to 6.53 square miles of land loss per year in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canals, dredging and land reclamation in the Louisiana coastal zone|last=|first=|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|year=1973|isbn=|location=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CZIC-gc57-2-l667-no-14/html/CZIC-gc57-2-l667-no-14.htm|pages=|quote=|via=www.gpo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The permits required to dredge these canals include stipulations of refilling, but these are not often enforced. [[John M. Barry]], along with a group of private lawyers and coastal experts, filed a lawsuit in 2013 against 97 corporations who had violated their permits in Louisiana’s coastal wetlands in response to this. It is referred to as “the most ambitious environmental lawsuit ever” by the New York Times and has been met with political resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/02/magazine/mag-oil-lawsuit.html|title=The Most Ambitious Environmental Lawsuit Ever|last=Rich|first=Nathaniel|date=2014-10-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wetland dredging chemistry ==
[[File:PC070242 (6786429209).jpg|thumb|269x269px|Canal dredged in a wetland area.]]
Wetlands are dynamic systems that undergo a variety of chemical reactions depending greatly on the specific physicochemical properties of the area, such as temperature, pressure, dissolved organic matter, pH, salinity, and dissolved gases (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The qualities that have the largest effect are salinity and pH.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An increase in flooding (a result of dredging) increases the salinity of wetlands, as it allows saltwater to intrude, neutralizes the pH, and provides more anaerobic soil conditions. The conditions then effect the nutrient availability and redox reactions.

=== Redox reactions ===
Redox reactions are highly influential in wetland soil chemistry through transformations including those of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The abundance of oxygen changes the abundance of oxidized or reduced states of each compound. Areas of higher oxygen availability (aerobic) tend towards oxidized states and areas of low oxygen availability (anaerobic) tend towards reduced states. The abundance of each type results in a different ecosystem, as the plants and animals of the wetlands require specific conditions for their growth. Common wetland redox reactions include:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; +10e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; +12H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; +8e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; +9H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; +4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +8e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; +8H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; +4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; +3H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dredging allows for an increased flow of water through wetlands, causing anaerobic soil conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This change in wetland type results in a change in redox state for each reaction undergone and thus changes the plant species available to grow in those areas. The redox potential (Eh) can help to show the relationship of the redox reactions through the [[Nernst equation]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Eh=E&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-(RT/nF)ln([Reductants]&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;/[Oxidants]&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This equation allows for the calculation of the extent of reaction between two redox systems and can be used, for example, to decide whether a particular reaction will go to completion or not.

An example of a change in these circumstances affecting the wetland system is in the transformation of [[pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) through the reduction of SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; (found in seawater).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + 6e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 8H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → S + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;S + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → FeS + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;FeS + S → FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (pyrite)&lt;/blockquote&gt;The drainage of the resulted pyrite then results in oxidation to ferric hydroxide and sulfuric acid, causing extreme acidity (pH &lt; 2).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Nutrient availability ===
[[File:Nørre_Vorupør_Coast_one_third_sky_2012-11-18.jpg|alt=Coast of a place|thumb|Coastal land]]
Increased flooding also allows for saltwater intrusion, changing the salinity levels and killing off species of plants that normally grew and changing available nutrient, chemical, and oxygen levels as well. An increase in salinity leads to higher sulfate concentrations and higher sulfide emissions, and higher toxicity. It also results in a reduction of sulfur availability to plant species as it precipitates with trace metals such as zinc and copper.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An example of this is Ferrous sulfide (FeS), which gives wetland soils their black color and is the source of sulfur commonly found in coal deposits.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Flooding also results in pH neutralization of generally acidic (with exceptions) wetlands. Acidic wetlands inhibit denitrification, thus flooding allows denitrification to occur, resulting in a loss of gaseous nitrogen forms to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The reaction is shown below:&lt;blockquote&gt;5C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; +24NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; +24H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → 30CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +12N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +42H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/blockquote&gt;Anaerobic soil conditions brought on by flooding allows for precipitation of phosphates with ferric iron and aluminum (acidic soils) or calcium and magnesium (basic soils) resulting in phosphorus being unavailable for uptake in plant species.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Importance of wetland chemistry ==
As the environment is altered through physical means (dredging), the occurring reactions change resulting in a decrease of the availability of nutrients and chemical species to plant species and the ecosystem. This then further changes the physical environment as these species are no longer able to survive. The loss of species then results in further changes to the chemical environment, as they are no longer present to remove excess nutrients. This also changes the physical environment further as the lack of survival of plant species results in open land and increased erosion. The change of the chemical environment also affects the mitigation techniques to be applied for rebuilding of wetlands as the survival of plant species that could potentially be planted depends on the chemical environment, and changes must be monitored for effective mitigation to take place.

'''Climate risk''' means a risk resulting from [[climate change]] and affecting natural and human systems and regions.

In the course of increasing global temperature and extreme weather phenomena
the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) has been founded by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) for a better understanding of [[climate change]] and meeting concerns of these observations. Its main aim is evaluating climate risks and exploring strategies for the prevention of these risks.

==Climate risks==
As per current projections of [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] the following future effects have to be expected:
* Continuous increase of temperature
* Cumulation of [[extreme weather]] phenomena
* [[Bumper crops]] and [[crop failure]]
* [[Polar_ice_cap#Earth|Polar cap melting]]
* Changes of the planet’s ecology
* [[Epidemic|Spreading diseases]]
* Attenuation of the [[North Atlantic Drift]]

While affecting all economic sectors, the effect on single continents will differ. Beside these direct physical climate risks there are also indirect derived ones:
* Physical risks
* [[Regulation]]al risks
* [[Litigation]]al risks
* [[Competition]] risks
* [[Production (economics)|Production]] risks
* [[Reputation]] risks

===Physical risks===
Direct risks of climate change are expected especially for branches, which strongly depend on natural resources like [[agriculture]], [[fishing]], [[forestry]], [[health care]], [[real estate]] and [[tourism]]. For example, storms and flooding damage buildings and infrastructure, whereas hot summers with less precipitation cause crop failure.
===Regulational risks===
The governmental endeavours to reduce climate costs have direct effects on economy. For example, the targets regarding emissions within the [[Kyoto-Protocol]] shall be realised by implementing [[emissions trading]]. By this instrument the value of emissions can be quantified monetarily, approximating the value of avoiding hazardous substances. This value shall be internalized by companies and considered in investment decisions. By considering emission costs the prices for i.e. energy and transport can increase and therefore change consumer demand. The insecurity of legislation leads to indefinite adjournation of projects and investments.

===Litigational risks===
Similar to the [[tobacco industry]], industries producing excessive greenhouse gases are exposed to the risk of an increasing number of lawsuits, if damages can be traced back to emissions, i.e. for floodings, crop failure, etc.

===Competition risks===
If companies do not take measures to reduce climate risks they are competitively disadvantaged. This might lead to increasing production costs caused by obsolete technologies and therefore to decreasing profits.

===Production risks===
Production shortfalls can result from direct or indirect climate risks. I.e. [[hurricane]]s damaging oil production facilities can lead to a scarcity of oil and increasing prices. Also the price for energy will rise, because [[heatwave]]s cause [[water scarcity]] and therefore the supply for [[cooling water]] of [[power plant]]s becomes short.

===Reputation risks===
Companies who are publicly criticized for their environmental policy or high emission rates, might lose customers, because of negative reputation. This risk is currently subordinate.

==Climate opportunities==
Besides climate risks also opportunities can derive from climate change for some branches and innovative companies, i.e. for the automobile and renewable energy sectors. Especially energy-intensive sectors can reduce energy costs by using more efficient technologies, which necessarily have to be developed in near future.

'''Cornelis "Conny" van Rietschoten''' (23 March 1926 – 17 December 2013) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[yacht]] skipper who was the only skipper to win the [[Whitbread Round the World Race]] twice.&lt;ref name=obit1&gt;{{cite|author=Richard Gladwell|url=http://www.sail-world.com/USA/Round-the-World-champion,-Conny-van-Rietschoten-dies-at-87/117705|title=Round the World champion, Conny van Rietschoten dies at 87|date=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=obit2&gt;{{cite|url=http://cdn.sailingscuttlebutt.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Rietschoten.pdf|newspaper=The Times|date=2013-12-20|title=Obituaries - Cornelis van Rietschote}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Rotterdam]], van Rietschoten was unknown as a sailor even in his own waters before competing in the [[1977–78 Whitbread Round the World Race]]. At 45, the industrialist had retired from active business and was looking for a fresh challenge. He had read reports about the first Whitbread Race, saw it as the opportunity of a lifetime – and grabbed it with both hands. A circumnavigation was something his Father, Jan Jacob, had always wanted to do but never found the time. The younger Van Rietschoten had in fact been sailing since he was three, and had continued until tuberculosis interrupted both his sailing and business career in the early 1960s. He spent a year convalescing in a Swiss [[sanatorium]], and then threw all his energies into developing the family electrical engineering business, Van Rietschoten &amp; Houwens.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imtech.com/EN/corporate/About-Imtech/Profile/History.html|title=History|work=imtech.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102135715/http://imtech.com/EN/corporate/About-Imtech/Profile/History.html|archivedate=2 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What set Van Rietschoten ahead of the established sailing names like [[Sir Robin Knox-Johnston]] and [[Éric Tabarly]] was a professional business approach to his campaigns. His eight-year tenure at the top of the sport spelled the end of amateur gung-ho ocean racing entries. He may well have continued to see himself as an [[amateur]], but he set levels of professionalism within the sport that were not repeated until [[Peter Blake (sailor)|Peter Blake]] also won every leg with his ''[[Steinlager 2]]'' in the [[1989–90 Whitbread Round the World Race]].

Van Rietschoten was first to undertake extensive trials and crew training before the race, and invested in research to improve crew clothing, rigs and [[weather forecasting]] techniques.

For his first Whitbread yacht, Conny van Rietschoten turned to American designers [[Sparkman &amp; Stephens]] to design a more modern version of the [[Swan 65]] production yacht ''[[Sayula II]]'', which had won the [[1973–74 Whitbread Round the World Race|first Whitbread race in 1973/74]]. The new ''[[Flyer (yacht)|Flyer]]'', built in aluminium by [[Jachtwerf W. Huisman]], was also a ketch, but with a longer waterline and more sail area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sparkmanstephens.blogspot.com/2011/03/design-2273-flyer.html|title=Design 2273 - Flyer|author=Bruce Johnson|date=2011-03-30|website=sparkmanstephens.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superyachttimes.com/editorial/5/article/id/12015/|title=Sailing yacht Flyer returns to Royal Huisman|work=superyachttimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning the transatlantic race, the ''Flyer'' crew found their greatest rival to be another Swan 65, the sloop rigged British yacht ''[[King's Legend]]'', with Nick Ratcliffe as the skipper and American Skip Novak as the navigator. 1,000 miles from [[Cape Town]], the two crews found themselves within sight of each other, before ''Flyer'' pulled ahead to win the first leg of the race from Portsmouth by 2 hours 4 minutes.
On the second leg to [[Auckland]], New Zealand, ''[[King's Legend]]'' stole the upper hand, and soon had a 360mile lead over ''Flyer'' as the Whitbread fleet raced across the [[Southern Ocean]], but then suffered a leak, which slowed her progress. At the finish, Conny van Rietschoten’s crew had cut ''[[King's Legend]]’s'' lead back to within 1 hour 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stephenlirakis.com/?tag=kings-legend|title=King’s Legend|website=stephenlirakis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third leg around [[Cape Horn]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]] proved something of an anti-climax as far as the race was concerned, for Kings Legend suffered a broach and water wiped out her radio. Without weather forecasts, Novak and his crew were at a distinct disadvantage and fell almost 60 hours behind ''Flyer''.

On the final leg back to [[Portsmouth]], Van Rietschoten and his crew had only to shadow Kings Legend home which they did, finishing 2 hours behind the British yacht, to win the Whitbread Race on handicap. ''Flyer'' was recently refitted by the original manufacturer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charterworld.com/news/royal-huisman-sailing-yacht-flyer-returns-home-yard-refit|title=Royal Huisman sailing yacht FLYER returns to her home yard for refit|work=charterworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1981/82 Whitbread Race saw Conny van Rietschoten’s maxi sloop ''[[Flyer II (yacht)|Flyer II]]'' designed by German Frers matched against Peter Blake’s 68&amp;nbsp;ft [[Bruce Farr]] designed ''Ceramco New Zealand''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbsailing.blogspot.com/2013/04/ceramco-new-zealand-farr-68.html|title=Ceramco New Zealand Farr 68|website=rbsailing.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ceramco New Zealand'' was dismasted during the first leg to give ''Flyer II'' a run-away victory on this first stage of the race to Cape Town, but thereafter, the two yachts raced neck-and-neck around the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalhuisman.com/en/yachtdescription145.html|title=Flyer II|website=royalhuisman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Sailboards to Superyachts|author=Jack Smith|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=IGzfDvE6R0cC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=flyer|date=January 1985|page=144|magazine=Yachting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=ZSIKlK3ZmNIC&amp;pg=RA1-PA37|pages=37-40|date=February 1982|author=Barry Pickthall|magazine=Cruising World|title=How is the Flyer team keeping warm?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at the height of this competition when Conny van Rietschoten showed the steely side of his character. He suffered a [[heart attack]] when their yacht was deep into the Southern Ocean, en route to Auckland, New Zealand. Van Rietschoten swore his crew to secrecy, and would not even allow the ''Flyer II'' doctor Julian Fuller to call a [[cardiologist]] aboard their rival yacht Ceramco for advice. “The nearest port was 10 days away and the critical period is always the first 24–36 hours,” he recalled later. “Ceramco was already breathing down our necks. If they had known that I had a health problem, they would have pushed their boat even harder. When you die at sea, you are buried over the side. Perhaps those Ceramco boys might then have spotted me drifting by. And that I was determined would be the only thing they would see or hear from ''Flyer II'' on the matter!”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/history.html|title=History|author=Volvo Ocean Race|work=Volvo Ocean Race}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Flyer II'' pulled out a 9 hour lead by Auckland, but ''Ceramco New Zealand'' won the leg on handicap. The race from there to Cape Horn was one of constantly swapping places. Half way across the [[Pacific]], they were within sight of each other, and also rounded Cape Horn together. ''Flyer II'' got to [[Mar del Plata]] first to take line honours, but the ''Ceramco New Zealand'' crew were rewarded with 2nd on handicap.

Conny van Rietschoten and his crew finished first again back at Portsmouth, followed by ''Ceramco New Zealand'' to take line honours for the Race, and with the rest of the fleet becalmed near the [[Azores]], took handicap honours too – the first crew to win both line and handicap honours in the history of the Race. Van Rietschoten and his crew also set two world records: The fastest Noon to Noon run of 327 miles, and the fastest circumnavigation of 120 days

In 1948 Conny van Rietschoten and his friend Morin Scott sailed their Dragon class yacht ''Gerda'' from Cowes England across the North Sea to Arendal to compete in that year's [[Dragon Gold Cup]] world championship. They did not win, but Crown Prince Olaf of Norway proclaimed the two sailors the best at the regatta for sailing by far the furthest distance.

Since the 1980s the Conny van Rietschoten Trophy has been awarded each year as the best Dutch sailor.

On 17 December 2013, Conny van Rietschoten died in Portugal.&lt;ref name=obit1/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit2/&gt;

{{Life timeline}}
The '''Cryogenian''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|k|r|aɪ|oʊ|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|i|ə|n}}, from [[Greek language|Greek]] κρύος ''(krýos)'', meaning "cold" and γένεσις ''(génesis)'', meaning "birth") is a [[geologic period]] that lasted from {{Mya|720 |635}}.&lt;ref name="SG-20170113" /&gt; It forms the second [[geology|geologic]] [[geologic period|period]] of the [[Neoproterozoic]] [[era (geology)|Era]], preceded by the [[Tonian]] Period and followed by the [[Ediacaran]].

The [[Sturtian glaciation|Sturtian]] and [[Marinoan glaciation]]s occurred during the Cryogenian period,&lt;ref&gt;These events were formerly considered together as the Varanger glaciations, from their first detection in Norway's [[Varanger Peninsula]].&lt;/ref&gt; which are the greatest [[ice age]]s known to have occurred on Earth. These events are the subject of much [[scientific controversy]]. The main debate contests whether these glaciations covered the entire planet (the so-called "[[Snowball Earth]]") or a band of open sea survived near the equator (termed "slushball Earth").

==Ratification==
The Cryogenian period was ratified in 1990 by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]].&lt;ref name="Plumb 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Plumb |first=Kenneth A. |title=New Precambrian time scale |journal=Episode |year=1991 |volume=14 |series=2 |pages=134–140 |accessdate=7 September 2013 |url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/bak/Precambrian.pdf |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to most other time periods, the beginning of the Cryogenian is not linked to a globally observable and documented event. Instead, the base of the period is defined by a fixed rock age, that was originally set at 850&amp;nbsp;million years,&lt;ref name="GSSP Table - Precambrian"&gt;{{cite web |title=GSSP Table - Precambrian |url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/Stratigraphy/gssp/index.php?parentid=181 |publisher=Geologic Timescale Foundation |accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but changed in 2015 to 720&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name="SG-20170113"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale |title=Chart |publisher=International Commission on Stratigraphy |accessdate=2017-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113013553/http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale |archivedate=2017-01-13 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is problematic because estimates of rock ages are variable and are subject to laboratory error. For instance, the time scale of the [[Cambrian]] Period is not reckoned by rock younger than a given age ({{Period start|Cambrian}} million years), but by the appearance of the worldwide ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' diagnostic [[trace fossil]] assemblages. This means that rocks can be recognized as Cambrian when examined in the field and do not require extensive testing to be performed in a lab to find a date.

Currently, there is no consensus on what global event is a suitable candidate to mark the start of the Cryogenian Period, but a [[ice age|global glaciation]] would be a likely candidate.&lt;ref name="GSSP Table - Precambrian" /&gt;

==Climate==
The name of the geologic period refers to the very cold global climate of the Cryogenian.

Characteristic glacial deposits indicate that [[Earth]] suffered the most severe ice ages in its history during this period (Sturtian and Marinoan).  According to Eyles and Young, "Late Proterozoic glaciogenic deposits are known from all the continents.  They provide evidence of the most widespread and long-ranging glaciation on Earth."   Several glacial periods are evident, interspersed with periods of relatively warm climate, with glaciers reaching sea level in low paleolatitudes.&lt;ref name=Eyles&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eyles|first1=Nicholas|last2=Young|first2=Grant|editor1-last=Deynoux|editor1-first=M.|editor2-last=Miller|editor2-first=J.M.G.|editor3-last=Domack|editor3-first=E.W.|editor4-last=Eyles|editor4-first=N.|editor5-last=Fairchild|editor5-first=I.J.|editor6-last=Young|editor6-first=G.M.|editorlink3=Eugene Domack|title=Geodynamic controls on glaciation in Earth history, in Earth's Glacial Record|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521548039|pages=5–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glacier]]s extended and contracted in a series of rhythmic pulses, possibly reaching as far as the equator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Microfossil lineages support sloshy snowball Earth |author = Dave Lawrence |year = 2003 |publisher = Geotimes |url = http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/apr03/WebExtra041803.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cryogenian is generally considered to be divisible into at least two major worldwide glaciations. The [[Sturtian glaciation]] persisted from 720 to 660 million years ago, and the [[Marinoan glaciation]] which ended approximately 635 Ma, at the end of the Cryogenian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shields | first1 = G. A. | title = Palaeoclimate: Marinoan meltdown | doi = 10.1038/ngeo214 | journal = Nature Geoscience | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 351–353 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2008NatGe...1..351S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deposits of glacial [[tillite]] also occur in places that were at low latitudes during the Cryogenian, a phenomenon which led to the hypothesis of deeply frozen planetary oceans called "[[Snowball Earth]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, P.F. 2001. [http://www.snowballearth.org ''Snowball Earth theory'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paleogeography==
{{main article|Rodinia#Geodynamics}}
Before the start of the Cryogenian, around 750 Ma, the cratons that made up the supercontinent [[Rodinia]] started to rift apart. The superocean [[Mirovia]] began to close while the superocean [[Panthalassa]] began to form. The cratons (possibly) later assembled into another supercontinent called [[Pannotia]], in the [[Ediacaran]].

Eyles and Young state, "Most Neoproterozoic glacial deposits accumulated as glacially influenced marine strata along rifted continental margins or interiors."  Worldwide deposition of dolomite might have reduced atmospheric carbon dioxide.  The break up along the margins of [[Laurentia]] at about 750 [[Myr|Ma]] occurs at about the same time as the deposition of the Rapitan Group in North America, contemporaneously with the Sturtian in Australia.  A similar period of rifting at about 650 Ma occurred with the deposition of the Ice Brook Formation in North America, contemporaneously with the Marinoan in Australia.&lt;ref name=Eyles/&gt;  The Sturtian and Marinoan are local divisions within the [[Adelaide Rift Complex]].

== Cryogenian biota and fossils ==
Fossils of testate amoeba (or [[Arcellinida]]) first appear during the Cryogenian period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Testate amoeba in the Neoproterozoic Era: evidence from vase-shaped microfossils in the Chuar Group, Grand Canyon |author1=Porter, S.A. |author2=Knoll, A.H.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year = 2000 |journal = Paleobiology |volume = 26 |issue = 3 |pages = 360–385. |doi = 10.1666/0094-8373(2000)026&lt;0360:TAITNE&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn = 0094-8373}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Cryogenian period, the oldest known fossils of [[sponges]] (and therefore [[animals]]) make an appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Fossil steroids record the appearance of Demospongiae during the Cryogenian period |url=http://eaps.mit.edu/geobiology/recent%20pubs/Love%20et%20al%202009.pdf |author = Love |year = 2009 |journal = Nature |doi = 10.1038/nature07673 |last2 = Grosjean |first2 = Emmanuelle |last3 = Stalvies |first3 = Charlotte |last4 = Fike |first4 = David A. |last5 = Grotzinger |first5 = John P. |last6 = Bradley |first6 = Alexander S. |last7 = Kelly |first7 = Amy E. |last8 = Bhatia |first8 = Maya |last9 = Meredith |first9 = William |volume = 457 |issue = 7230 |pages = 718–721 |pmid = 19194449|bibcode = 2009Natur.457..718L|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maloof|first=Adam C.|first2=Catherine V.|last2=Rose|first3=Robert|last3=Beach|first4=Bradley M.| last4=Samuels|first5=Claire C.|last5=Calmet|first6=Douglas H.|last6=Erwin|first7=Gerald R.|last7=Poirier|first8=Nan|last8=Yao|first9=Frederik J.|last9=Simons|title=Possible animal-body fossils in pre-Marinoan limestones from South Australia|journal=Nature Geoscience|date=17 August 2010|volume=3|pages=653–659|doi=10.1038/ngeo934|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v3/n9/abs/ngeo934.html|issue=9|bibcode = 2010NatGe...3..653M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Discovery of possible earliest animal life pushes back fossil record |date = 2010-08-17 |url = http://www.physorg.com/news201273825.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The issue of whether or not biology was impacted by this event has not been settled, for example Porter (2000) suggests that new groups of life evolved during this period, including the [[red algae]] and [[green algae]], [[stramenopile]]s, [[ciliate]]s, [[dinoflagellate]]s, and testate amoeba.&lt;ref&gt;http://palaeos.com/proterozoic/neoproterozoic/cryogenian/cryogenian2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dead water''' is the nautical term for a phenomenon which can occur when a layer of [[Freshwater|fresh]] or [[brackish water]] rests on top of denser [[Seawater|salt water]], without the two layers mixing. A ship powered by direct thrust under the waterline (such as a propeller), traveling in such conditions may be hard to maneuver or can even slow down almost to a standstill. Much of the energy from the ship's propeller only results in waves and turbulence between the two layers of water, leaving a ship capable of traveling at perhaps as little as 20% of its normal speed. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The phenomenon was first described by [[Fridtjof Nansen]], the Norwegian Arctic explorer.
Nansen wrote the following from his ship ''[[Fram]]'' in August 1893 in the [[Nordenskiöld Archipelago]] near the [[Taymyr Peninsula]]:
* "When caught in dead water Fram appeared to be held back, as if by some mysterious force, and she did not always answer the helm. In calm weather, with a light cargo, Fram was capable of 6 to 7 knots.&lt;ref&gt;{{convert|6|to|7|kn|km/h mph|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in dead water she was unable to make 1.5 knots.&lt;ref&gt;{{convert|1.5|kn|km/h mph|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; We made loops in our course, turned sometimes right around, tried all sorts of antics to get clear of it, but to very little purpose."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science-frontiers.com/sf080/sf080g15.htm Walker, J.M.; "Farthest North, Dead Water and the Ekman Spiral," Weather, 46:158, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

This phenomenon is observable where [[glacier]] runoff flows into salt water without much mixing, such as in [[fjord]]s.

[[File:Avaste soo ääreala (5).JPG|thumb|Outer [[Avaste_Nature_Reserve|Avaste Fen]], western [[Estonia]]]]
[[File:Illustrated diagram of a fen.jpg|thumb]]
A '''fen''' is one of the main types of [[wetland]], the others being grassy [[marsh]]es, forested [[swamp]]s, and peaty [[bog]]s. Along with bogs, fens are a kind of [[mire]]. Fens are [[minerotrophic]] [[peatland]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Rydin, Hakan and John K. Jeglum. ''The Biology of Peatlands'', 2nd edn. Oxford: OUP, 2013. p. 11. {{ISBN|978-0-19-960299-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; usually fed by mineral-rich surface water or [[groundwater]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Godwin|Godwin ''et al.'' (2002)]].&lt;/ref&gt; They are characterised by their distinct water chemistry, which is [[pH|pH neutral]] or [[alkali]]ne, with relatively high dissolved [[mineral]] levels but few other [[plant nutrition|plant nutrient]]s. They are usually dominated by grasses and [[sedge]]s, and typically have brown mosses in general including ''[[Scorpidium]]'' or ''[[Drepanocladus]]''.&lt;ref name="Keddy_8"&gt;[[#Keddy|Keddy (2010)]], p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt; Fens frequently have a high diversity of other plant species including carnivorous plants such as ''[[Pinguicula]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wheeler|Wheeler &amp; Giller (1982)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Keddy|Keddy (2010)]], Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; They may also occur along large lakes and rivers where seasonal changes in water level maintain wet soils with few woody plants.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Charlton|Charlton &amp; Hilts (1989)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of individual species of fen plants is often closely connected to water regimes and nutrient concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Slack|Slack ''et al.'' (1980)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schröder|Schröder ''et al.'' (2005)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fens have a characteristic set of plant species, which sometimes provide the best indicators of environmental conditions. For example, fen indicator species in New York State include ''[[Carex|Carex flava]]'', ''[[Cladium mariscoides]]'', ''[[Potentilla fruticosa]]'', ''[[Pogonia ophioglossoides]]'' and ''[[Parnassia glauca]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Godwin|Godwin ''et al.'' (2002)]], Table 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fens are distinguished from [[bog]]s, which are [[acid]]ic, low in minerals, and usually dominated by sedges and shrubs, along with abundant mosses in the genus ''[[Sphagnum]]''.&lt;ref name="Keddy_8"/&gt;  Bogs also tend to exist on dome-shaped landmasses where they receive almost all of their usually-abundant moisture from rainfall, whereas fens appear on slopes, flats, or depressions and are fed by surface and underground water in addition to rain.

Fens have been damaged in the past by land drainage, and also by [[peat]] cutting.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sheail|Sheail &amp; Wells (1983)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some are now being carefully restored with modern management methods.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Keddy|Keddy (2010)]], Chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal challenges are to restore natural water flow regimes, to maintain the quality of water, and to prevent invasion by woody plants.

==Vegetation==

''[[Carr (topography)|Carr]]'' is the northern European equivalent of the wooded [[swamp]] of the [[southeastern United States]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buglife.org.uk/conservation/adviceonmanagingbaphabitats/fens Bug Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304033143/http://www.buglife.org.uk/conservation/adviceonmanagingbaphabitats/fens |date=2010-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known in the United Kingdom as [[wet woodland]]. It is a fen overgrown with generally small trees of species such as [[willow]] (''Salix spp.'') or [[alder]] (''Alnus'' spp.). In general, fens may change in composition as [[peat]] accumulates. A list of species found in a fen can therefore cover a range of species from those remaining from the earlier stage in the [[Ecological succession|successional development]] to the [[Pioneer species|pioneers]] of the succeeding stage.

Where streams of base-rich water run through bog, these are often lined by strips of fen, separating "islands" of rain-fed bog.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Temporary flooding by [[beaver]]s can have negative effects on fens.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reddoch|Reddoch &amp; Reddoch (2005)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of term in literature==
Shakespeare used the term "fen-sucked" to describe the fog (literally: rising from marshes) in ''[[King Lear]]'', when Lear says "Infect her beauty, You fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun, To fall and blister."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=William Shakespeare|title=King Lear, Act II, Scene IV, line 162|url=http://www.shakespeareswords.com/Plays.aspx?Ac=2&amp;SC=4&amp;IdPlay=11#153271|publisher=Penguin Books |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=2008|quote=You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames, Into her scornful eyes!

Fisheries-induced evolution '''(FIE)''' is the [[microevolution]] of an exploited aquatic organism's population, brought on through the artificial selection for biological traits by [[Fishing techniques|fishing practices]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fishing, of any severity or effort, will impose an additional layer of mortality to the natural population equilibrium and will be selective to certain genetic traits within that organism's gene pool. This removal of selected traits fundamentally changes the population [[Allele frequency|gene frequency]], resulting in the artificially induced microevolution by the proxy of the survival of untargeted fish and their propagation of heritable biological characteristics. This artificial selection often counters natural [[Life history theory|life-history pattern]] for many species, such as causing early sexual maturation, diminished sizes for matured fish, and reduced fecundity in the form of smaller egg size, lower sperm counts and viability during reproductive events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These effects can have prolonged effects on the adaptability or fitness of the species to their environmental factors.  

Fisheries-induced evolution differ to the norm [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] evolution model by the direct human factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlson|first=Stephanie M.|last2=Edeline|first2=Eric|last3=Asbjørn Vøllestad|first3=L.|last4=Haugen|first4=Thrond. O.|last5=Winfield|first5=Ian J.|last6=Fletcher|first6=Janice M.|last7=Ben James|first7=J.|last8=Stenseth|first8=Nils Chr.|date=June 2007|title=Four decades of opposing natural and human-induced artificial selection acting on Windermere pike (Esox lucius)|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=10|issue=6|pages=512–521|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01046.x|pmid=17498150|issn=1461-023X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For FIE, fishing enforces a greater selection pressure for traits, often through sheer effort and catch numbers, which can disparage natural selection pressures such as predator-prey interactions and environmental influences.  

== Causes ==
Fishing practices that permanently remove animals from their population (i.e. not [[catch and release]]) drive direct fisheries-induced evolution by removing the genetic materials of those animals from the population. Individuals that are untargeted, through the selection bias of fishing gears and/or legislation, are allowed to reproduce and proliferate their genetic materials. As fishing pressures persist, traits belonging to non-selected organisms are preserved through survival and become more dominant in frequency within the gene pool. Additionally, fishing on a targeted species incur knock-on effects to those around it by its disturbance of their natural interactions. In these situations, specific traits of the untargeted species may be favourable under the diminutive presence, or absence, of the targeted species, and therefore indirectly selected for.      

=== Direct selection ===
The direct selection for biological traits through fishery practices is the result of fishery management regulations, and gear restrictions and selectivities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heino|first=Mikko|last2=Díaz Pauli|first2=Beatriz|last3=Dieckmann|first3=Ulf|date=2015-12-04|title=Fisheries-Induced Evolution|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=461–480|doi=10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-112414-054339|issn=1543-592X|url=http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11318/1/HeinoEtAl2015-Fisheries-induced%20evolution%20IIASA%20AnnRevEcolEvolSyst.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious artificial selection for traits through management legislation can be observed in the imposed regulations on size, sex, seasonality, and locations.  

Catch size regulations vary with specificity to the targeted species and is often used to prevent exploitation during a specific part of the life cycle for the organism. Such regulations arose in response to the effects of FIE observed by the fisheries of Atlantic Cod (''[[Atlantic cod|Gadus morhua]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jakobsdóttir|first=Klara B.|last2=Pardoe|first2=Heidi|last3=Magnússon|first3=Árni|last4=Björnsson|first4=Höskuldur|last5=Pampoulie|first5=Christophe|last6=Ruzzante|first6=Daniel E.|last7=Marteinsdóttir|first7=Guðrún|date=2011-01-05|title=Historical changes in genotypic frequencies at the Pantophysin locus in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in Icelandic waters: evidence of fisheries-induced selection?|journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=4|issue=4|pages=562–573|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00176.x|issn=1752-4571|pmc=3352422|pmid=25568005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the fishing technological revolution that has lead to the species moratorium, the exploitation of Atlantic Cod have been selective towards larger-sized fish since the 1500s. Catch data for the species have quantitatively shown that this selectivity for larger fish for over 500 years have shifted the life-history patterns, resulting in earlier sexual maturation and smaller sizes at said maturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Esben M.|last2=Heino|first2=Mikko|last3=Lilly|first3=George R.|last4=Morgan|first4=M.

Sexual selectivity by a fishery works on the theoretical foundation that the preservation of females allows their reproductive input to offset the fishing mortality. Fisheries of species with low fecundity such as mud crabs (''Scylla serrata'') and blue swimmer crabs (''Portunus armatus'') often adopt this method and only allow the harvesting of males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/business-priorities/fisheries/species-identification/inshore-estuarine-species/mud-crab|title=Mud crab (mangrove crab)|website=www.daf.qld.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The direct selection for traits, with respect to sex selectivity, occurs when specific characteristics or behaviours increase the susceptibility of the organisms for harvest. For example, corking wrasses (''[[Corkwing wrasse|Symphodus melops]]'') are harvested as a biological control for sea lice within farmed salmon facilities of the northern hemisphere. Male fish dominate these wild fisheries in both catch per unit effort and weight owing to their strong nesting behaviour and territorial nature, which differentiate them from females and sneaker males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/40796/19/Hanssen--Master-2014.pdf|title=Consequences of Selective Harvesting a Small Temperate Fish Species Displaying Strong Male Dimorphism, the Corking Wrasse (Symphodus melops)|last=Hanssen|first=Benjamin|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent fishing pressures over the years have reduced maturation age and size for these nesting males, in addition to increasing the density of sneaker males to the detriment of the localised population.    

=== Indirect selection ===
Indirect fishery-induced evolution occurs when a species with some level of ecological significance is targeted by a fishery, and their diminished presence within the ecology causes a flow on effect to other untargeted species. [[Keystone species|Keystone]] or [[Umbrella species|umbrella]] species provide many ecological services to the environment which they belong to, ranging from the provision of habitat and food, to the control of biodiversity by preventing any one organism from dominating. Removal or reduction of these organisms often cause significant changes to the behaviours and physiology of the organisms which were once controlled. 

Non-migratory reef sharks (''[[Blacktip reef shark|Carcharhinus melanopterus]], [[Grey reef shark|C. amblyrhynchos]],'' and ''[[Whitetip reef shark|Triaenodon obesus]]'') play the vital role in weeding out sick and ill-adapted individuals from within a population, in addition to controlling the abundance of larger size fish. Thus, these sharks are an ever-present mortality factor for many reef organisms. Fisheries targeting these apex predators inherently allow for the proliferation of medium-sized predatory fishes (e.g. barracudas, juvenile groupers, trevallies, snappers) at the expense of the cohabiting smaller species. When this happen, the FIE responses observed from smaller species have been consistent with their increasing egg production and shifted life-history for early sexual maturation.

Another example of FIE that is instigated indirectly can be seen in the ornamental or aquarium trade industry. In particular, [[Coral|corals]] and [[Sea anemone|anemones]] are highly prized ornamental commodities and are often harvested at unsustainable rates for profit within the Malay archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shuman|first=Craig S.|last2=Hodgson|first2=Gregor|last3=Ambrose|first3=Richard F.|date=2005-09-07|title=Population impacts of collecting sea anemones and anemonefish for the marine aquarium trade in the Philippines|journal=Coral Reefs|language=en|volume=24|issue=4|pages=564–573|doi=10.1007/s00338-005-0027-z|issn=0722-4028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal of anemones at rates higher than their resettlement into the reefs, as observed in the Philippines, is known to have caused drastic reduction in the localised population of clownfish or anemonefish (''[[Amphiprioninae|Amphiprion sp.]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Madduppa|first=Hawis H.|last2=von Juterzenka|first2=Karen|last3=Syakir|first3=Mohammad|last4=Kochzius|first4=Marc|date=November 2014|title=Socio-economy of marine ornamental fishery and its impact on the population structure of the clown anemonefish Amphiprion ocellaris and its host anemones in Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia|journal=Ocean &amp; Coastal Management|volume=100|pages=41–50|doi=10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2014.07.013|issn=0964-5691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionarily, anemone fish observed on reefs that were subjected to intense and prolonged anemone fishing were significantly smaller, even for mature adult pairs, than those found living with an anemone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frisch|first=Ashley J.|last2=Rizzari|first2=Justin R.|last3=Munkres|first3=Katherine P.|last4=Hobbs|first4=Jean-Paul A.|date=2016-01-21|title=Anemonefish depletion reduces survival, growth, reproduction and fishery productivity of mutualistic anemone–anemonefish colonies|journal=Coral Reefs|language=en|volume=35|issue=2|pages=375–386|doi=10.1007/s00338-016-1401-8|issn=0722-4028}}&lt;/ref&gt; This size reduction is attributed to their need to hide in small coral crevices in the absence of a host.

== Evidence ==
Outside of observational data collected from active fisheries, the evidence for fisheries-induced evolution, or its symptoms, may be discerned through both commercial and recreational anecdotes. These stories often articulate the diminishing catch, reduction in their weight and length records, in addition to the mandatory increase to fishing efforts over time to attain similar fishing quotas to their historical references. However, experimental data was needed to clarify two fundamental questions regarding FIE, so that the aforementioned ramifications of smaller sizes and early maturation may not be attributed to non-anthropogenic factors such as population flux. The two evidentiary questions: a) Is fishing pressure capable of changing the gene frequency of a population to cause microevolution within such a short time frame? b) How can non-selective fishing gears (gill nets and trawlers) be selective for certain traits?  

=== Experimental evidence ===
The implementation of aquaculture experimental designs afford the possibility of isolating different biological traits and observing their impacts and heredity within a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=Roger W.|date=June 1986|title=An approach to the quantitative analysis of domestication selection in aquaculture|journal=Aquaculture|volume=33|issue=1–4|pages=167–185|doi=10.1016/0044-8486(83)90398-8|issn=0044-8486}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A study by Solberg et al. (2013) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solberg|first=Monica Favnebøe|last2=Skaala|first2=Øystein|last3=Nilsen|first3=Frank|last4=Glover|first4=Kevin Alan|date=2013-01-31|title=Does Domestication Cause Changes in Growth Reaction Norms?

In this study, Atlantic salmon (''[[Atlantic salmon|Salmo salar]]'') were subjected to a modified '[[Transplant experiment|common garden]]' design, and the researchers isolated stress as an abiotic independent variable to the growth rates of salmon. By selecting for fish with a lower biological response to stress, a domesticated population was created within 10 generations of breeding, which exhibited a threefold increase in growth rate over its wild counterpart. Thus, the difference between the absence of larger fish, which can be misattributed to overfishing, and FIE lies in the inherited biological characteristics that were untargeted by fishing.   

Fishing techniques such as [[Gillnetting|gill nets]] and [[Trawling#Environmental%20effects|trawling]] are often associated with a lack of selectivity within the environment which they are operated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milton|first=David A.|last2=Die|first2=David|last3=Tenakanai|first3=Charles|last4=Swales|first4=Stephen|date=1998|title=Selectivity for barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in the Fly River, Papua New Guinea: implications for managing gill-net fisheries on protandrous fishes|url=https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF98065|journal=Marine and Freshwater Research|language=en|volume=49|issue=6|pages=499|doi=10.1071/mf98065|issn=1323-1650}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to establish whether selectivity can occur under these practices, when fishing data suggest that an entire localised population may be caught or up to 80% of the effort to go to bycatches and not the targeted species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=R.W.D.|last2=Cripps|first2=S.J.|last3=Nickson|first3=A.|last4=Porter|first4=G.|date=July 2009|title=Defining and estimating global marine fisheries bycatch|journal=Marine Policy|volume=33|issue=4|pages=661–672|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2009.01.003|issn=0308-597X}}&lt;/ref&gt; An experiment by Biro and Post (2008) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biro|first=Peter A.|last2=Post|first2=John R.|date=2008-02-26|title=Rapid depletion of genotypes with fast growth and bold personality traits from harvested fish populations|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/8/2919|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=105|issue=8|pages=2919–2922|doi=10.1073/pnas.0708159105|issn=0027-8424|pmc=2268560|pmid=18299567}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that despite being mechanically unselective of gill nets, behavioural variation in certain fish species can indeed affect the likelihood of them being caught and therefore be a function for selectivity. Using a ‘[[Experimental evolution|selection experiment]] in the field’ model, two genotypes of rainbow trouts (''[[Rainbow trout|Oncorhynchus mykiss]]'') were transplanted into identical artificial lake habitats and subjected to matching gill net fishing pressures. The net in question were designed to capture all size variability within the simulated populations. Trouts exhibiting the genotypes for faster growth rates and therefore a more active lifestyle were found to have a 60% increase chance to be caught in comparison to those characterised by the more sedentary genotype. Therefore, for 'non-selective' fishing methods, the selecting factor rests not on the gear itself but on the inherent behavioural variations within the population.

== Implications ==
Fisheries-induced evolution is a function of the fishing-induced genetic drift, and to some extent represent the reduction of genetic diversity within the targeted population. For many exploited population, this reduction in genetic diversity has been predicted to reduce their adaptability to both environmental variability and ecological competitiveness.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuparinen|first=Anna|last2=Hutchings|first2=Jeffrey A.|date=2012-07-07|title=Consequences of fisheries-induced evolution for population productivity and recovery potential|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1738/2571|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=279|issue=1738|pages=2571–2579|doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.0120|issn=0962-8452|pmc=3350703|pmid=22398166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the commonly observed fisheries-induced adaptation of younger and smaller size at sexual maturation counter specific life-history characteristics that would enable interspecies competition for resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marty|first=Lise|last2=Dieckmann|first2=Ulf|last3=Ernande|first3=Bruno|date=January 2015|title=Fisheries-induced neutral and adaptive evolution in exploited fish populations and consequences for their adaptive potential|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4310581/|journal=Evolutionary Applications|volume=8|issue=1|pages=47–63|doi=10.1111/eva.12220|issn=1752-4571|pmc=4310581|pmid=25667602}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biological model by Kindsvater and Palkovacs (2017) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kindsvater|first=Holly K.|last2=Palkovacs|first2=Eric P.|date=September 2017|title=Predicting Eco-evolutionary Impacts of Fishing on Body Size and Trophic Role of Atlantic Cod|journal=Copeia|language=en-US|volume=105|issue=3|pages=475–482|doi=10.1643/ot-16-533|issn=0045-8511}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that FIE Atlantic cod, due to their smaller sizes, actually belong to a lower trophic level irrespective of their original position prior to the species moratorium. Furthermore, the FIE effect of reducing egg counts and their viability have weakened the number of recruitments back into the population after spawning, thereby reducing the localised population density. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enberg|first=Katja|last2=Jørgensen|first2=Christian|last3=Dunlop|first3=Erin S.|last4=Heino|first4=Mikko|last5=Dieckmann|first5=Ulf|date=2009-07-31|title=ORIGINAL ARTICLE: Implications of fisheries-induced evolution for stock rebuilding and recovery|journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=394–414|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2009.00077.x|issn=1752-4571|pmc=3352485|pmid=25567888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pardo|first=Luis M.|last2=Riveros|first2=Marcela P.|last3=Fuentes|first3=Juan Pablo|last4=Pinochet|first4=Ramona|last5=Cárdenas|first5=Carla|last6=Sainte-Marie|first6=Bernard|date=2017-05-13|title=High fishing intensity reduces females' sperm reserve and brood fecundity in a eubrachyuran crab subject to sex- and size-biased harvest|url=https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/74/9/2459/3823336|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science|language=en|volume=74|issue=9|doi=10.1093/icesjms/fsx077|issn=1054-3139}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the reduced population abundance and smaller sizes, the increase in ''per capita'' resource has been stipulated to counteract the effects of competitions between different species by reducing intraspecific interactions, which can allow for maximal density-dependent growth to happen. This also means that for harvesting to be sustainable, yearly or seasonal assessment of viable reproductive stocks and their recruitment rates must be performed to account for the compromised fecundity and recovery statuses.   

There is limited data on the interactions between FIE affected species and their robustness to environmental fluctuations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For many species, the additional mortality rate and the frequency of harvesting exerted by the fisheries make it difficult to elucidate how environmental factors such as temperatures, salinity and currents can be beneficial or detrimental for stocks, since their effects on deaths or recruitment gains are diminutive in comparison. However, with the rapidly evolving climates stemming from the anthropogenic inputs, an understanding of how FIE affects the adaptability of these aquatic population will be necessary, not only for future stock assessments, but also sustainable harvesting.

'''Geophysical fluid dynamics''', in its broadest meaning, refers to the fluid dynamics of naturally occurring flows, such as lava flows, oceans, and planetary [[atmosphere]]s, on [[Earth]] and other [[planet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vallis|first1=Geoffrey K.|title=Geophysical fluid dynamics: whence, whither and why?|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|date=24 August 2016|volume=472|issue=2192|pages=20160140|doi=10.1098/rspa.2016.0140|bibcode=2016RSPSA.47260140V|pmc=5014103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two physical features that are common to many of the phenomena studied in geophysical fluid dynamics are [[Rotating reference frame|rotation of the fluid]] due to the planetary rotation and [[Stratification (water)|stratification]] (layering). The applications of geophysical fluid dynamics do not generally include the circulation of the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], which is the subject of [[geodynamics]], or fluid phenomena in the [[magnetosphere]].

== Fundamentals ==

To describe the flow of geophysical fluids, equations are needed for [[Momentum#Conservation|conservation of momentum]] (or [[Newton's second law]]) and [[conservation of energy]]. The former leads to the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. Further approximations are generally made. First, the fluid is assumed to be [[incompressible flow|incompressible]]. Remarkably, this works well even for a highly compressible fluid like air as long as [[sound]] and [[shock wave]]s can be ignored.&lt;ref name=Tritton/&gt;{{rp|2&amp;ndash;3}} Second, the fluid is assumed to be a [[Newtonian fluid]], meaning that there is a linear relation between the [[shear stress]] {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;tau;&lt;/var&gt;}} and the [[Deformation (mechanics)#Strain|strain]] {{math|''u''}}, for example
:&lt;math&gt; \tau = \mu \frac{d u}{d x},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;/var&gt;}} is the [[viscosity]].&lt;ref name=Tritton/&gt;{{rp|2&amp;ndash;3}} Under these assumptions the Navier-Stokes equations are
:&lt;math&gt;
\overbrace{\rho \Big(
\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t}}_{
\begin{smallmatrix}
  \text{Eulerian}\\
  \text{acceleration}
\end{smallmatrix}} +
\underbrace{\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}}_{
\begin{smallmatrix}
  \text{Advection}
\end{smallmatrix}}\Big)}^{\text{Inertia (per volume)}} =
\overbrace{\underbrace{-\nabla p}_{
\begin{smallmatrix}
  \text{Pressure} \\
  \text{gradient}
\end{smallmatrix}} +
\underbrace{\mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v}}_{\text{Viscosity}}}^{\text{Divergence of stress}} +
\underbrace{\mathbf{f}}_{
\begin{smallmatrix}
  \text{Other} \\
  \text{body} \\
  \text{forces}
\end{smallmatrix}}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The left hand side represents the acceleration that a small parcel of fluid would experience in a reference frame that moved with the parcel (a [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian frame of reference]]). In a stationary (Eulerian) frame of reference, this acceleration is divided into the local rate of change of velocity and [[advection]], a measure of the rate of flow in or out of a small region.&lt;ref name=Tritton&gt;{{cite book |last=Tritton |first=D. J. |title = Physical Fluid Dynamics |edition = Second |year = 1990 |publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn = 0-19-854489-8 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44&amp;ndash;45}}

The equation for energy conservation is essentially an equation for heat flow. If heat is transported by [[Thermal conduction|conduction]], the heat flow is governed by a [[diffusion]] equation. If there are also [[buoyancy]] effects, for example hot air rising, then [[natural convection]], also known as free convection, can occur.&lt;ref name=Tritton/&gt;{{rp|171}} Convection in the Earth's [[outer core]] drives the [[dynamo theory|geodynamo]] that is the source of the [[Earth's magnetic field]].&lt;ref name=Merrill&gt;{{cite book |last=Merrill|first=Ronald T.|last2=McElhinny|first2=Michael W.|last3=McFadden|first3=Phillip L.|title=The magnetic field of the earth: paleomagnetism, the core, and the deep mantle|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|year=1996|isbn=978-0-12-491246-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at=Chapter 8}} In the ocean, convection can be ''thermal'' (driven by heat), ''haline'' (where the buoyancy is due to differences in salinity), or ''[[Thermohaline circulation|thermohaline]]'', a combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Open ocean circulation|first=A.|last=Soloviev|first2=B.|last2=Klinger|editor-last1=Thorpe|editor-first1=Steve A.|title=Encyclopedia of ocean sciences elements of physical oceanography|date=2009|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|isbn=9780123757210|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buoyancy and stratification ==
[[File:Messina-waves-image.jpg|thumb|Internal waves in the [[Strait of Messina]] (photographed by [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ASTER]]).]]
Fluid that is less dense than its surroundings tends to rise until it has the same density as its surroundings. If there is not much energy input to the system, it will tend to become [[Stratification (water)|stratified]]. On a large scale, Earth's atmosphere is [[Atmosphere of Earth#Principal layers|divided into a series of layers]]. Going upwards from the ground, these are the [[troposphere]], [[stratosphere]], [[mesosphere]], [[thermosphere]], and [[exosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/mos-upper-atmosphere.html#.VHg5AzHF8vY|title=Earth's Upper Atmosphere|last=Zell|first=Holly|date=2015-03-02|newspaper=NASA|access-date=2017-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The density of air is mainly determined by temperature and [[water vapor]] content, the density of [[seawater|sea water]] by temperature and [[salinity]], and the density of lake water by temperature. Where stratification occurs, there may be thin layers in which temperature or some other property changes more rapidly with height or depth than the surrounding fluid. Depending on the main sources of buoyancy, this layer may be called a [[pycnocline]] (density), [[thermocline]] (temperature), [[halocline]] (salinity), or [[chemocline]] (chemistry, including oxygenation).

The same buoyancy that gives rise to stratification also drives [[gravity wave]]s. If the gravity waves occur within the fluid, they are called [[internal wave]]s.&lt;ref name=Tritton/&gt;{{rp|208&amp;ndash;214}}

In modeling buoyancy-driven flows, the Navier-Stokes equations are modified using the [[Boussinesq approximation (buoyancy)|Boussinesq approximation]]. This ignores variations in density except where they are multiplied by the [[gravitational acceleration]] {{math|''g''}}.&lt;ref name=Tritton/&gt;{{rp|188}}

If the pressure depends only on density and vice versa, the fluid dynamics are called [[Barotropic fluid|barotropic]]. In the atmosphere, this corresponds to a lack of fronts, as in the [[tropics]]. If there are fronts, the flow is [[Baroclinity|baroclinic]], and instabilities such as [[cyclone]]s can occur.&lt;ref name=Haby&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5313">'''Georgina King''' (1845-1932), was an Australian amateur geologist and anthropologist.

Georgina King was born on 6 June 1845 in [[Fremantle|Fremantle, Western Australia]], to George King, a Church of England clergyman from Ireland, and his wife Jane Mathewson.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/king-georgina-13025|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Bygott|first=Ursula|last2=Hooker|first2=Claire|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother Kelso King would also bring acclaim to the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/king-sir-george-eccles-kelso-6957|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=King|first=Hazel|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, her family moved to Sydney. King's father, a fellow of [[St Paul's College, University of Sydney|St Paul's College]], oversaw her education and encouraged her to read widely including books on evolution and natural history. Her family doctor, [[George Bennett (naturalist)|George Bennett]], a keen naturalist, recommended texts on geology to her. Discouraged by her father and Bennett from marrying, King looked after a nephew and niece at [[Springwood, New South Wales|Springwood]] from the 1870s until 1881, and then travelled to Britain and Europe.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Scientific studies ==
After returning to Australia, King was active in the Women's Literary Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13924425|title=WOMEN'S LITERARY SOCIETY. - The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954) - 8 Jun 1893|website=Trove|access-date=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was founded in 1889, along with friend [[Rose Scott]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; King was an original member of the Women's Club. In 1888, King attended the inaugural meeting of the [[Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science|Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS). She met many distinguished scientists through this meeting and later corresponded with [[Robert Logan Jack|R. L. Jack]], who had done extensive geological surveys of Queensland and (Sir) [[Frederick McCoy]] of Victoria. Recalling the geological history she had been taught in her youth, and inspired by the work of McCoy and others, King proposed a 'Tertiary Period Catastrophism' theory to the wider scientific community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37407525|title=CHURCH PIONEERING IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA. - THE FIRST ANGLICAN CHURCH.

Her controversial ideas and claims to theories posed by other scientists, led to further ridicule.

King published papers on anthropological subjects after 1900. She used some of her father's work on Aborigines to expand her ideas, and continued to elaborate on her geological theory of evolution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Anthropological Society of Australasia]], and published within its journal, Science of Man. From 1913 King corresponded with and financially supported, [[Daisy Bates (Australian author)|Daisy Bates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article79078527|title=Corroborees as Travelling Shows. - The Northern Miner (Charters Towers, Qld. : 1874 - 1954) - 3 Mar 1915|website=Trove|access-date=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; another woman who felt frustrated by the scientific establishment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

King volunteered with the Red Cross during [[World War I]]. She made dolls for patients of the [[Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children]] and was a prolific letter writer to the daily newspapers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

King died on 7 June 1932 at Darling Point, Sydney, and was cremated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16897639|title=MISS GEORGINA KING. - The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954) - 11 Jun 1932|website=Trove|access-date=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
King donated many specimens of natural science to the [[Australian Museum]] and [[Powerhouse Museum|Technological Museum of Sydney]]. Her papers are held by the State Library of New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110319561|title=Georgina King papers 1899-1930 MLMSS 273|last=|first=|date=|website=State Library of New South Wales|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geosmin''' is an [[organic compound]] with a distinct earthy flavor and aroma produced by certain bacteria, and is responsible for the earthy taste of [[beet]]s and a contributor to the strong scent ([[petrichor]]) that occurs in the air when rain falls after a dry spell of weather or when soil is disturbed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expasy.org/spotlight/back_issues/035/ The earth's perfume], ''Protein Spotlight'', Issue 35, June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In chemical terms, it is a [[Bicyclic molecule|bicyclic]] [[alcohol]] with [[chemical formula|formula]] {{Chemical formula|C|12|H|22|O}}, a derivative of [[decalin]]. Its name is derived from the Greek {{lang|el|γεω-}} "earth" and {{lang|el|ὀσμή}} "smell".

== Production ==

Geosmin is produced by the [[Gram-positive bacteria|gram-positive]] [[bacteria]] ''[[Streptomyces]]'' and various [[cyanobacteria]], and released when these [[microorganism]]s die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Izaguirre G, Taylor WD. | year = 2004 | title = A guide to geosmin- and MIB-producing cyanobacteria in the United States | journal = Water Sci Technol. | volume = 49 | issue = 9 | pages = 19–24 | pmid = 15237602}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Zaitlin B, Watson SB. | year = 2006 | title = Actinomycetes in relation to taste and odour in drinking water: Myths, tenets and truths | journal = Water Res. | volume = 40 | issue = 9 | pages = 1741–53 | pmid = 16600325 | doi = 10.1016/j.watres.2006.02.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Suurnäkki S, Gomez-Saez GV, Rantala-Ylinen A, Jokela J, Fewer DP, Sivonen K. | year = 2015 | title = Identification of geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol in cyanobacteria and molecular detection methods for the producers of these compounds | journal = Water Res. | volume = 68 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–66 | pmid = 25462716 | doi = 10.1016/j.watres.2014.09.037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities whose [[water]] supplies depend on surface water can periodically experience episodes of unpleasant-tasting water when a sharp drop in the population of these bacteria releases geosmin into the local water supply. Under [[acid]]ic conditions, geosmin decomposes into odorless substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 5866039 | volume=13 | issue=6 |date=November 1965 | pages=935–8 | last1 = Gerber | first1 = NN | last2 = Lechevalier | first2 = HA | title = Geosmin, an earthly-smelling substance isolated from actinomycetes. | pmc = 1058374 | journal = Applied Microbiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[biosynthesis]] of geosmin by a bifunctional ''[[Streptomyces coelicolor]]'' [[enzyme]] was unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja062669x | volume = 128 | issue = 25 | pages = 8128–8129 | last1 = Jiang | first1 = J. | first2 = X. | last2 = He | first3 = D.E. | last3 = Cane | title = Geosmin biosynthesis. ''Streptomyces coelicolor'' germacradienol/germacrene D Synthase converts farnesyl diphosphate to geosmin | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | year = 2006 | pmid = 16787064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.2007.29 | volume = 3| last1 = Jiang | first1 = J. | first2 = X. | last2 = He | first3 = D.E. | last3 = Cane | pmc = 3013058 | title = Biosynthesis of the earthy odorant geosmin by a bifunctional ''Streptomyces coelicolor'' enzyme | journal = [[Nat. Chem. Biol.]] | year = 2007 | pages = 711–5 | pmid = 17873868 | issue = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single enzyme, [[geosmin synthase]], converts [[farnesyl diphosphate]] to geosmin in a two-step reaction.

''Streptomyces coelicolor'' is the model representative of a group of soil-dwelling bacteria with a complex lifecycle involving [[Mycelium|mycelial growth]] and [[spore formation]]. Besides the production of volatile geosmin, it also produces many other complex molecules of pharmacological interest; its [[genome]] sequence is available at the [[Sanger Institute]].&lt;ref name="Sanger"&gt;{{cite web |title=The genome of ''Streptomyces coelicolor'' A3(2) producing geosmin |publisher=Sanger Institute |url=http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_coelicolor/ |accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==

The [[human nose]] is extremely sensitive to geosmin and is able to detect it at concentrations as low as 5 parts per trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Polak | first1 = E.H. | last2 = Provasi | first2 = J. | title = Odor sensitivity to geosmin enantiomers | journal = Chemical Senses | volume = 17 | pages = 23 | year = 1992 | doi = 10.1093/chemse/17.1.23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geosmin is responsible for the muddy smell in many commercially important freshwater fish such as [[carp]] and [[catfish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vallod|first=D.|last2=Cravedi|first2=J. P.|last3=Hillenweck|first3=A.|last4=Robin|first4=J.|date=2007-04-03|title=Analysis of the off-flavor risk in carp production in ponds in Dombes and Forez (France)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10499-007-9080-7|journal=Aquaculture International|language=en|volume=15|issue=3-4|pages=287–298|doi=10.1007/s10499-007-9080-7|issn=0967-6120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovell|first=Richard T.|last2=Lelana|first2=Iwan Y.|last3=Boyd|first3=Claude E.|last4=Armstrong|first4=Martin S.|date=1986-05-01|title=Geosmin and Musty-Muddy Flavors in Pond-Raised Channel Catfish|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1986)1152.0.CO;2|journal=Transactions of the American Fisheries Society|volume=115|issue=3|pages=485–489|doi=10.1577/1548-8659(1986)115&lt;485:gamfip&gt;2.0.co;2|issn=0002-8487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geosmin combines with [[2-methylisoborneol]], which concentrates in the fatty skin and dark muscle tissues. Geosmin breaks down in acid conditions; hence, vinegar and other acidic ingredients are used in fish recipes to help reduce the muddy flavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3tKAfqxkFAIC|title=Westwood Lake Chronicles|last=Winkler|first=Lawrence|date=2012-08-06|publisher=Lawrence Winkler|isbn=9780991694105|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous locations have included Lake Buena Vista, Florida, Rochester, New York, Long Beach, California, Chicago, Illinois, New Orleans, Louisiana, Phoenix, Arizona, Providence, Rhode Island, and Dallas, Texas.

== Activities ==
The training sessions are organized by a series of themed categories, commonly known as ''tracks''. Previous tracks have included building operations &amp; maintenance (O&amp;M), [[contracting]], [[energy security]], [[project financing]], [[greenhouse gas]]es, legislation, [[Energy management system|energy management controls systems]] (EMCS), [[renewable energy]], specialty buildings, sustainbility, technology, and [[water efficiency]]. The majority of the tracks feature nine sessions, and are held over the course of two and a half days. The tracks and individual sessions have been designed to meet the needs of "federal facility managers, federal energy coordinators, and federal procurement officials.”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techrevu.com/php/Review-id.php?id=3622\”/]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sessions are taught by professionals representing both the public and private sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/-news/2010/08/27/44351-2010-govenergy-conference-brings-feds-private-sector-together-to-work-energy-issues/|title=2010 GovEnergy conference brings feds, private sector together to work energy issues|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; GovEnergy also features a mid-size trade show and a series of educational tours.

The '''Greenland Ice Core Project''' (GRIP) was a multinational [[Europe]]an research project, organized through the [[European Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esf.org/activities/research-networking-programmes/life-earth-and-environmental-sciences-lesc/completed-esf-research-networking-programmes-in-life-earth-and-environmental-sciences/greenland-icecore-project-grip.html |title=Greenland Icecore Project (GRIP): European Science Foundation |last= |first= |date= |website=European Science Foundation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208131950/http://www.esf.org/activities/research-networking-programmes/life-earth-and-environmental-sciences-lesc/completed-esf-research-networking-programmes-in-life-earth-and-environmental-sciences/greenland-icecore-project-grip.html |archive-date=8 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |access-date=18 March 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding came from 8 nations ([[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], and [[United Kingdom]]), and from the [[European Union]].

The project ran from 1989 to 1995, with drilling seasons from 1990 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esf.org/activities/research-networking-programmes/life-earth-and-environmental-sciences-lesc/completed-esf-research-networking-programmes-in-life-earth-and-environmental-sciences/greenland-icecore-project-grip/more-information.html |title=More Information: European Science Foundation |last= |first= |date=24 August 2010 |website=European Science Foundation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207150245/http://www.esf.org/activities/research-networking-programmes/life-earth-and-environmental-sciences-lesc/completed-esf-research-networking-programmes-in-life-earth-and-environmental-sciences/greenland-icecore-project-grip/more-information.html |archive-date=7 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |access-date=18 March 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  GRIP successfully drilled a 3029-metre [[ice core]] to the bed of the [[Greenland ice sheet]] at Summit, Central [[Greenland]] from 1989 to 1992 at {{coord|72|34.74|N|37|33.92|W}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neem.dk/documentation/2015/Renland-EGRIP2015FieldPlan.pdf|title=Field season 2015 East GReenland Ice core Project (EGRIP) 2015-2020: Moving NEEM camp to new EGRIP drilling site. and REnland ice CAp Project (RECAP) 2015.|last=Ice and Climate Group|first=|date=|website=NEEM - University of Copenhagen|page=82|access-date=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gripcor1.jpg|thumb|right|A portion of the core]]

Studies of [[isotope]]s and various atmospheric constituents in the core have revealed a detailed record of [[Climate change|climatic variations]] reaching more than 100,000 years back in time. The results indicate that [[Holocene]] climate has been remarkably stable and have confirmed the occurrence of rapid climatic variation during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] (the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsin]]). Delta-O-18 variations observed in the core part believed to date from the [[Eemian Stage]] have not been confirmed by other records&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icecore/greenland/summit/document/gripinfo.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[North Greenland Ice Core Project|NGRIP]] core and are now believed not to represent climate events: the [[interglacial]] climate of Eemian Stage appears to have been as stable as the Holocene.

'''Güney Waterfall''' ({{lang-tr|Güney Şelalesi}}) is a [[waterfall]] in [[Denizli Province]], western Turkey. It is a registered [[natural monument]] of the country.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

==Location and access==
The waterfall is located in the Cindere village of the [[Güney]] district of Denizli Province. It is {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} distant from [[Denizli]] and {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Güney.&lt;ref name="dv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt; The road to the waterfall is paved with [[cobblestone]]s.&lt;ref name="h3"/&gt; 

==Waterfall==
The waterfall is fed by waters of a spring dropping from a height of {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}}, which joins the [[Büyük Menderes River]]. The [[carbonated water]] dissolved [[limestone]] formation rocks and formed [[travertine]]s on the waterfall base. A cave situated under the waterfall contains a pond.&lt;ref name="dv"/&gt;

It is a popular visitor attraction. Around 20,000 local and foreign tourists visit the site annually.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

Used as a local recreational area since the 1960s,&lt;ref name="h4"/&gt; the waterfall and its surroundings, which cover an area of {{convert|4.98|da|sqft|abbr=on}}, was registered in 1994 as a natural monument by the Nature Reserve and Nature Parks Administration of the [[Ministry of Forest and Water Management (Turkey)|Ministry of Forest and Water Management]].&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

In the summer of 2007, the waterfall faced the risk of disappearance due to drought in the region.&lt;ref name="h4"/&gt; To overcome the threat, water was brought by pipeline over a distance of {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt; The {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}}-high rock wall of the waterfall collapsed following a [[landslide]], which occurred in the afternoon of May 13, 2013. As a result of the rockfall, the waterfall almost disappeared. One person at the site sustained light injuries.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt; In April 2014 workers diverted the stream and reestablished the waterfall about {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} to the side of the waterfall's initial location. Facilities were added to the site for outdoor recreation. The waterfall area was also illuminated to accommodate nighttime visitors.&lt;ref name="h3"/&gt;

'''Helig ap Glanawg''' (standard modern [[Welsh (language)|Welsh]] orthography: '''Helig ap Glannog''') is a legendary figure described in various accounts dating to at least as early as the 13th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Early Cultures of North-West Europe |year=1950 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=231 |author=Rachel Bromwich |editor=Cyril Fox, Bruce Dickins |chapter=Cantre'r Gwaelod and Ker-Is}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a 6th-century prince who lived in [[North Wales]].

Post-medieval tradition says that the [[river Conwy]] once reached the sea by the [[Great Orme]], [[Llandudno]], and to the west lay the great cantref of Gwaelod which stretched all the way to [[Puffin Island, Anglesey|Puffin Island]], off [[Anglesey]]. Helig ap Glanawg was said to have lived here when his land was inundated by the sea, which formed the Lavan Sands which lie between the Great Orme's Head and the [[Menai Strait]] off the north coast of Gwynedd.  The legend states the remains of [[Llys Helig]], said to be his palace but in fact the remnants of a [[glacial moraine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bird| first = Eric| title = Encyclopedia of the World's Coastal Landforms| year = 2010| publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-1402086380 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can be seen at exceptionally low tides, this being near the Conwy channel, about a mile or so off the coast at [[Penmaenmawr]]. The earliest known use of the name Llys Helig for this rock formation is the [[Halliwell Manuscript]], published in 1859, which is believed to date to around the beginning of the 17th century, eleven centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Early Cultures of North-West Europe|year=1950|publisher=Cambridge University Press|editor=Cyril Fox and Bruce Dickins|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

----
After the disaster both Helig and his numerous sons are said to have embraced a religious life. These sons, according to various sources, were -
* Celynin, who has a church dedicated to him at [[Llangelynin]] in the [[Conwy valley]], and there is another at [[Llangelynin, Gwynedd|Llangelynin]] near Llwyngwril, a few miles south of Llanaber.
* Rhychwyn, the saint associated with [[Llanrhychwyn]] church.
* [[Bodfan]], to whom the church at Aber, in Gwynedd, is dedicated.
* Brothen, who founded the Church at [[Llanfrothen]]
* [[Saint Peris|Peris]], who founded the churches at [[Llanberis]] and [[Nant Peris]]. 
* Boda and Gwynin, who founded the church at [[Dwygyfylchi]], near Penmaenmawr.

==Legend possibly of the same origin as that of Cantre'r Gwaelod==

[[Rachel Bromwich]] discusses what she refers to as the folk-tale of [[Cantre'r Gwaelod]], another alleged sunken kingdom but in [[Cardiganshire]]. As with Llys Helig, there are tales of remains being seen of the sunken kingdom.  Bromwich believes that the two stories influenced each other, and that "The widespread parallels to this inundation theme would suggest that the two stories are in fact one in origin, and were localized separately in Cardiganshire and in the Conway estuary, around two traditional figures of the sixth century. She also notes that the Halliwell Manuscript gives Helig the title "Lord of Cantre'r Gwaelod".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Early Cultures of North-West Europe|year=1950|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=231|author=Rachel Bromwich|editor=Cyril Fox, Bruce Dickins|chapter=Cantre'r Gwaelod and Ker-Is}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''New Directions In Celtic Studies'' Antone Minard wrote that "The Welsh legends of Cantre'r Gwaelod and Llys Helig (Helig's Court) contain the same details of audible bells beneath the waves and ruins which are visible at the equinoctial tides, which are the anchors of credulity in the story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Hale| first1 = Amy| last2 = Payton| first2 = Philip| title = New Directions In Celtic Studies| year = 2000| publisher = University of Exeter Press| isbn = 9780859896221| page = 60| chapter = Pre-Packaged Breton Folk Narrative| editor = Amy Hale and Philip Payton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ionization''' or '''ionisation''', is the process by which an [[atom]] or a [[molecule]] acquires a negative or positive charge by gaining or losing [[electron]]s to form [[ion]]s, often in conjunction with other chemical changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Ionization|file=I03183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ionization can result from the loss of an electron after collisions with [[subatomic particle]]s, collisions with other atoms, molecules and ions, or through the interaction with [[electromagnetic radiation]]. [[Heterolytic bond cleavage]] and heterolytic [[substitution reaction]]s can result in the formation of ion pairs. Ionization can occur through radioactive decay by the [[internal conversion]] process, in which an excited nucleus transfers its energy to one of the [[inner-shell electrons]] causing it to be ejected.

==Uses==
Everyday examples of gas ionization are such as within a [[fluorescent lamp]] or other [[electrical discharge]] lamps. It is also used in radiation detectors such as the [[Geiger-Müller counter]] or the [[ionization chamber]]. The ionization process is widely used in a variety of equipment in fundamental science (e.g., [[mass spectrometry]]) and in industry (e.g., [[radiation therapy]]).

==Production of ions==
[[File:Electron avalanche.gif|thumb|350px|Avalanche effect between two electrodes. The original ionization event liberates one electron, and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron, so two electrons emerge from each collision: the ionizing electron and the liberated electron.]]
Negatively charged ions are produced when a free electron collides with an atom and is subsequently trapped inside the electric potential barrier, releasing any excess energy. The process is known as [[electron capture ionization]].

Positively charged ions are produced by transferring an amount of energy to a bound electron in a collision with charged particles (e.g. ions, electrons or positrons) or with photons. The threshold amount of the required energy is known as [[ionization potential]].  The study of such collisions is of fundamental importance with regard to the few-body problem (see article on [[few-body systems]]), which is one of the major unsolved problems in physics.  [[Kinematically complete experiment]]s,&lt;ref name="schulz"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schulz |first1=Michael |title=Three-Dimensional Imaging of Atomic Four-Body Processes |journal=Nature |volume=422 |issue=6927 |date=2003 |pages=48–51 |issn= |doi=10.1038/nature01415|bibcode =  2003Natur.422...48S |pmid=12621427}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. experiments in which the complete momentum vector of all collision fragments (the scattered projectile, the recoiling target-ion, and the ejected electron) are determined, have contributed to major advances in the theoretical understanding of the few-body problem in recent years.

Adiabatic ionization is a form of ionization in which an electron is removed from or added to an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] in its lowest [[energy state]] to form an ion in its lowest energy state.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=adiabatic ionization|file=A00143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Townsend discharge]] is a good example of the creation of positive ions and free electrons due to ion impact. It is a cascade reaction involving [[electron]]s in a region with a sufficiently high [[electric field]] in a gaseous medium that can be ionized, such as [[air]]. Following an original ionization event, due to such as ionizing radiation, the positive [[ion]] drifts towards the [[cathode]], while the free electron drifts towards the [[anode]] of the device. If the electric field is strong enough, the free electron gains sufficient energy to liberate a further electron when it next collides with another molecule. The two free electrons then travel towards the anode and gain sufficient energy from the electric field to cause impact ionization when the next collisions occur; and so on. This is effectively a chain reaction of electron generation, and is dependent on the free electrons gaining sufficient energy between collisions to sustain the avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn F Knoll. Radiation Detection and Measurement, third edition 2000. John Wiley and sons, {{ISBN|0-471-07338-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ionization efficiency is the ratio of the number of ions formed to the number of electrons or photons used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pure Appl. Chem. |date=1991 |volume=63 |pages=1541–1566 |issue=10 |title=Recommendations for Nomenclature and Symbolism for Mass Spectroscopy (including an appendix of terms used in vacuum technology)(IUPAC Recommendations 1991) |doi=10.1351/pac199163101541 |last1=Todd |first1=J. F. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=ionization efficiency|file=I03196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ionization energy of atoms==
[[File:First Ionization Energy.svg|thumb|500px|'''Figure 1'''. Ionization energies of neutral elements.]]
The trend in the [[ionization energy]] of atoms is often used to demonstrate the periodic behavior of atoms with respect to the atomic number, as summarized by ordering atoms in  [[Mendeleev's table]]. This is a valuable tool for establishing and understanding the ordering of electrons in [[atomic orbitals]] without going into the details of wave functions or the ionization process. An example is presented in '''figure 1'''. The periodic abrupt decrease in ionization potential after rare gas atoms, for instance, indicates the emergence of a new shell in [[alkali metals]]. In addition, the local maximums in the ionization energy plot, moving from left to right in a row, are indicative of s, p, d, and f sub-shells.

==Semi-classical description of ionization==
[[Classical physics]] and the [[Bohr model]] of the atom can qualitatively explain [[photoionization]] and collision-mediated ionization. In these cases, during the ionization process, the energy of the electron exceeds the energy difference of the potential barrier it is trying to pass. The semi-classical description, however, cannot describe [[tunnel ionization]] since the process involves the passage of electron through a classically forbidden potential barrier.

==Quantum mechanical description of ionization==
The interaction of atoms and molecules with sufficiently strong laser pulses leads to the ionization to singly or multiply charged ions. The ionization rate, i.e. the ionization probability in unit time, can only be calculated using [[quantum mechanics]]. In general, the analytic solutions are not available, and the approximations required for manageable numerical calculations do not provide accurate enough results. However, when the laser intensity is sufficiently high, the detailed structure of the atom or molecule can be ignored and analytic solution for the ionization rate is possible.

===Tunnel ionization===
[[File:Tunnel ionization 3.png|thumb|500px|Combined potential of an atom and a uniform laser field. At distances {{nowrap|''r'' &lt; ''r''{{sub|0}}}}, the potential of the laser can be neglected, while at distances with {{math|''r'' &gt; ''r''{{sub|0}}}} the Coulomb potential is negligible compared to the potential of the laser field. The electron emerges from under the barrier at {{math|''r'' {{=}} ''R''{{sub|c}}}}. {{math|''E''{{sub|i}}}} is the ionization potential of the atom.]]

[[Tunnel ionization]] is ionization due to [[quantum tunneling]]. In classical ionization, an electron must have enough energy to make it over the potential barrier, but quantum tunneling allows the electron simply to go through the potential barrier instead of going all the way over it because of the wave nature of the electron. The probability of an electron's tunneling through the barrier drops off exponentially with the width of the potential barrier. Therefore, an electron with a higher energy can make it further up the potential barrier, leaving a much thinner barrier to tunnel through and, thus, a greater chance to do so. In practice, tunnel ionization is observable when the atom or molecule is interacting with near-infrared strong laser pulses. This process can be understood as a process by which a bounded electron, through  the absorption of more than one photon from the laser field, is ionized. This picture is generally known as multiphoton ionization (MPI).

Keldysh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keldysh |first=L. V. |date=1965 |url=http://www.jetp.ac.ru/cgi-bin/e/index/e/20/5/p1307?a=list |title=Ionization in the Field of a Strong Electromagnetic Wave|journal=Soviet Phys. JETP |page=1307|volume=20|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; modeled the MPI process as a transition of the electron from the ground state of the atom to the Volkov states.&lt;ref&gt;Volkov D M 1934 Z. Phys. 94 250&lt;/ref&gt; In this model the perturbation of the ground state by the laser field is neglected and the details of atomic structure in determining the ionization probability are not taken into account. The major difficulty with Keldysh's model was its neglect of the effects of Coulomb interaction on the final state of the electron. As it is observed from figure,  the Coulomb field is not  very small in magnitude compared to the potential of the laser at larger distances from the  nucleus. This is in contrast to the approximation made by neglecting the potential of the laser at regions near the  nucleus. Perelomov et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Perelomov |first1=A.

  e^{-\frac{2}{3F} \left(2E_i\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

As compared to &lt;math&gt;W_{PPT}&lt;/math&gt; the absence of summation over n, which represent different [[above threshold ionization]] (ATI) peaks, is remarkable.

==Strong field approximation for the ionization rate==
The calculations of PPT are done in the '''E'''-gauge, meaning that the laser field is taken as electromagnetic waves.  The ionization rate can also be calculated in '''A'''-gauge, which emphasis the particle nature of light (absorbing multiple photons during ionization).  This approach was adopted by Krainov model&lt;ref name="Krainov1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krainov |first1=Vladimir P. |title=Ionization rates and energy and angular distributions at the barrier-suppression ionization of complex atoms and atomic ions |journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America B |volume=14 |issue=2 |date=1997 |page=425 |issn=0740-3224 |doi=10.1364/JOSAB.14.000425|bibcode = 1997JOSAB..14..425K }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the earlier works of Faisal&lt;ref name="Faisal1973"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Faisal |first1=F.

:&lt;math&gt;W_{KRA} =
  \sum_{n=N}^{n=\infty} 2 \pi \omega^2 p \left(n - n_\mathrm{osc}\right)^2 \int \mathrm{d}\Omega
  \left|FT \left(I_{KAR} \Psi \left(\mathbf{r}\right)\right)\right|^2
  J_n^2 \left(n_f, \frac{n_\mathrm{osc}}{2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where, &lt;math&gt; N=[n_i + n_\mathrm{osc}] &lt;/math&gt; is the minimum number of  photons necessary to ionize the atom, &lt;math&gt; n_{i} =E_i/\omega &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; n_\mathrm{osc} = U_{p} / \omega &lt;/math&gt; ( &lt;math&gt; U_p &lt;/math&gt; is the ponderomotive energy), &lt;math&gt; J_{n} (u, v) &lt;/math&gt; is the double Bessel function,  &lt;math&gt; p = \sqrt{ 2 \omega (n-n_\mathrm{osc}- n_i)} &lt;/math&gt;,   
&lt;math&gt; n_{f} = 2 \sqrt { n_\mathrm{osc} / \omega} p \cos(\theta) &lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt;  is the angle between the momentum of the electron, '''p''', and the electric field of the laser, '''F''', and, the symbol ''FT'' denotes the  three-dimensional Fourier transformation. Finally, &lt;math&gt; I_{KAR} = \left(\frac {2 Z^2}{n^2 F r}\right)^n &lt;/math&gt; incorporates the Coulomb correction in the SFA model.

===Atomic stabilization/population trapping===
In calculating the rate of MPI of atoms only transitions to the continuum states are considered. Such an approximation is acceptable as long as there is no multiphoton resonance between the ground state and some excited states. However, in real situation of interaction with pulsed lasers, during the evolution of  laser intensity, due to different Stark shift of the ground and excited states there is a possibility that some excited  state go into multiphoton resonance with the ground state. Within the dressed atom picture, the ground state dressed by &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; photons and the resonant state undergo an avoided crossing at the resonance intensity &lt;math&gt;I_r&lt;/math&gt;. The minimum distance, &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt;, at the avoided crossing is proportional to the generalized Rabi frequency, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(t)=\Gamma_m I(t)^{m/2}&lt;/math&gt; coupling the two states.  According  to Story et al.,&lt;ref name="StoryDuncan1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Story |first1=J. |last2=Duncan |first2=D. |last3=Gallagher |first3=T. |title=Landau-Zener treatment of intensity-tuned multiphoton resonances of potassium |journal=Physical Review A |volume=50 |issue=2 |date=1994 |pages=1607–1617 |issn=1050-2947 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.50.1607|pmid=9911054 |bibcode = 1994PhRvA..50.1607S }}&lt;/ref&gt; the probability of remaining in the ground state, &lt;math&gt;P_g&lt;/math&gt;,  is given by
:&lt;math&gt;P_g = \exp\left(-\frac{2\pi W_m^2}{\mathrm{d}W/\mathrm{d}t}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;  is the time-dependent energy difference between the two dressed states. In interaction  with a short pulse, if the dynamic resonance is reached in the rising or the falling part of the pulse, the population practically remains in the ground state and the effect of multiphoton resonances may be neglected. However, if the states go onto resonance at the peak of the pulse, where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}W/\mathrm{d}t = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the excited state is populated. After being populated, since the ionization potential of the excited state is small, it is expected that the electron will be instantly ionized.

In 1992, de Boer and Muller &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.68.2747|title=Observation of large populations in excited states after short-pulse multiphoton ionization|date=1992|last1=De Boer|first1=M.|last2=Muller|first2=H.|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=68|issue=18|pages=2747–2750|pmid=10045482|bibcode = 1992PhRvL..68.2747D }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that Xe atoms subjected to short laser pulses could survive in the highly excited states 4f, 5f, and 6f . These states were believed to have been excited by the dynamic Stark shift of the levels into multiphoton resonance with the field during the rising part of the laser pulse. Subsequent evolution of the laser pulse did not ionize completely these states leaving behind some highly excited atoms. We shall refer to this phenomenon as "population trapping".

[[File:Lambda type population trapping.png|right|thumb|500px|The schematic presentation of lambda type population trapping. G is the ground state of the atom. 1 and 2 are two degenerate excited states. After the population is transferred to the states due to multiphoton resonance, these states are coupled through continuum c  and the population is trapped in the superposition of these states.]]

We mention the theoretical calculation that incomplete ionization occurs whenever there is parallel resonant excitation into a common level with ionization loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hioe |first1=F. T. |last2=Carrol |first2=C. E. |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.37.3000|title=Coherent population trapping in N-level quantum systems|date=1988|journal=Physical Review A|volume=37|issue=8|pages=3000–3005|pmid=9900034|bibcode = 1988PhRvA..37.3000H }}&lt;/ref&gt; We consider a state such as 6f of Xe which consists of 7 quasi-degnerate levels in the range of the laser bandwidth. These levels along with the continuum constitute a lambda system.  The mechanism of the lambda type trapping is schematically presented in figure. At the rising part of the pulse (a) the excited state (with two degenerate levels 1 and 2) are not in multiphoton resonance with the ground state. The electron is ionized through multiphoton coupling with the continuum. As the intensity of the pulse is increased the excited state and the continuum are shifted in energy due to the Stark shift. At the peak of the pulse (b) the excited states go into multiphoton resonance with the ground state. As the intensity starts to decrease (c), the two state are coupled through continuum and the population is trapped in a coherent superposition of the two states. Under subsequent action of the same pulse, due to interference in the transition amplitudes of the lambda system, the field cannot ionize the population completely and a fraction of the population will be trapped in a coherent superposition of the quasi degenerate levels. According to this explanation the states with higher angular momentum- with more sublevels- would have a higher probability of trapping the population. In general the strength of the trapping will be determined by the strength of the two photon coupling between the quasi-degenerate levels via the continuum.In 1996, using the very stable laser and by minimizing the masking effects of the focal region expansion with increasing intensity, Talebpour et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Talebpour |first1=A. |last2=Chien |first2=C.

These structures were attributed to electron trapping in the strong laser field. A more unambiguous demonstration of population trapping has been reported by T. Morishita and C. D.

===Non-sequential multiple ionization===
The phenomenon of non-sequential ionization (NSI) of atoms  exposed  to intense laser fields has been a subject of many theoretical and experimental studies since 1983.  The pioneering work began with the observation of a “knee” structure on the Xe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion signal versus intensity curve by L’Huillier et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=L’Huillier |first1=A. |last2=Lompre |first2=L. A. |last3=Mainfray |first3=G. |last4=Manus |first4=C. |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.27.2503|title=Multiply charged ions induced by multiphoton absorption in rare gases at 0.53 μm|date=1983|journal=Physical Review A|volume=27|issue=5|page=2503|bibcode = 1983PhRvA..27.2503L }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the experimental point of view, the NS double ionization refers to processes which somehow enhance the rate of production of doubly charged ions by a huge factor at intensities below the saturation intensity of the singly charged ion. Many, on the other hand, prefer to define the NSI as a process by which two electrons are ionized nearly simultaneously. This definition implies that apart from the sequential channel &lt;math&gt; A+L -&gt; A^+ + L -&gt; A^{++} &lt;/math&gt; there is another channel &lt;math&gt; A+L-&gt; A^{++} &lt;/math&gt; which is the main contribution to the production of doubly charged ions at lower intensities. The first observation of triple NSI in [[argon]] interacting with a 1&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] laser was reported by Augst et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Augst |first1=S. |last2=Talebpour |first2=A. |last3=Chin |first3=S.

L. |journal=Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics|volume=31|issue=6|page=1201|bibcode = 1998JPhB...31.1201L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important conclusion of this study was the observation of the following relation between the rate of NSI to any charge state and the rate of tunnel ionization (predicted by the ADK formula) to the previous charge states; 
:&lt;math&gt; W_{NS}(A^{n+}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\alpha_n\left(\lambda\right) W_{ADK}\left(A^{i+}\right)&lt;/math&gt;  

where &lt;math&gt;W_{ADK}\left(A^{i+}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of quasi-static tunneling to i'th charge state and  &lt;math&gt;\alpha_n(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; are some constants depending on the wavelength of the laser (but not on the pulse duration).

Two models have been proposed to explain the non-sequential ionization;  the shake-off model and electron re-scattering model. The shake-off (SO) model,  first proposed by Fittinghoff et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fittinghoff |first1=D. N. |last2=Bolton |first2=P. R. |last3=Chang |first3=B. |last4=Kulander |first4=K. C. |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.69.2642 |title=Observation of nonsequential double ionization of helium with optical tunneling|date=1992|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=69|issue=18|pages=2642–2645|pmid=10046547|bibcode = 1992PhRvL..69.2642F }}&lt;/ref&gt; is adopted from the field of ionization of atoms by X rays and electron projectiles where the SO process is one of the major mechanisms responsible  for the multiple ionization of atoms. The SO model describes the NS process as a mechanism where one electron is ionized by the laser field and the departure of this electron is so rapid that the remaining electrons do not have enough time to adjust themselves to the new energy states. Therefore, there is a certain probability that, after the ionization of the first electron, a second electron is excited to states with higher energy (shake-up) or even ionized (shake-off). We should mention that, until now, there has been no quantitative calculation based on the SO model, and the model is still qualitative.

The electron rescattering model was independently developed by Kuchiev,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jetpletters.ac.ru/ps/1241/article_18763.pdf]{{cite journal |last=Kuchiev |first=M.

Corkum's model describes the NS ionization as a process whereby an electron is tunnel ionized. The electron then interacts with the laser field where it is accelerated away from the nuclear core. If the electron has been ionized at an appropriate phase of the field, it will pass by the position of the remaining ion half a cycle later, where it can free an additional electron by electron impact. Only half of the time the electron is  released with the appropriate phase and the other half  it never return to the nuclear core. The maximum kinetic energy that the returning electron can have is 3.17 times the ponderomotive potential (&lt;math&gt; U_p &lt;/math&gt;) of the laser. Corkum's model  places a cut-off limit on the minimum intensity (&lt;math&gt; U_p &lt;/math&gt; is proportional to intensity) where ionization due to re-scattering can occur. 

[[File:Kuchiev's model.png|thumb|Feynman diagram for the process of double ionization in an atom through re-scattering mechanism]]
The re-scattering model in Kuchiev's version (Kuchiev's model) is quantum mechanical. The basic idea of the model is illustrated  by Feynman diagrams in figure a. First both electrons are in the ground state of an atom. The lines marked a and b describe the corresponding atomic states. Then the electron a is ionized. The beginning of the ionization process is shown by the intersection with a sloped dashed line. where the MPI occurs. The propagation of the ionized electron in the laser field, during which it absorbs other photons (ATI), is shown by the full thick  line. The collision of this electron with the parent atomic ion is shown by a vertical dotted line representing the Coulomb interaction between the electrons. The state marked with c describes the ion excitation to a discrete or continuum state. Figure b describes the exchange process. Kuchiev's model, contrary to Corkum's model, does not predict any threshold intensity for the occurrence of NS ionization.

Kuciev did not include the Coulomb effects on the dynamics of the ionized electron. This resulted in the underestimation of the double ionization rate by a huge factor. Obviously, in the approach of Becker and Faisal (which is equivalent to Kuchiev's model in spirit), this drawback does not exist. In fact, their model is more exact and does not suffer from the large number of approximations made by Kuchiev.

===Multiphoton ionization of inner-valence electrons and fragmentation of polyatomic molecules===
The ionization of inner valance electrons are responsible for the fragmentation of polyatomic molecules in strong laser fields. According to a qualitative model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://slchin-symposium.copl.ulaval.ca/MPublication/168_CPL_313_0789.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0009-2614(99)01075-1 |title=Multiphoton ionization of inner-valence electrons and fragmentation of ethylene in an intense Ti:sapphire laser pulse |date=1999 |last1=Talebpour |first1=A. |last2=Bandrauk |first2=A.

*MPI of electrons from the inner orbitals of the molecule which results in a molecular ion in ro-vibrational levels of an excited electronic state;
*Rapid radiationless transition to the high-lying ro-vibrational levels of a lower electronic state; and
*Subsequent dissociation of the ion to different fragments through various fragmentation channels.

The short pulse induced molecular fragmentation may be used as an ion source for high performance mass spectroscopy. The selectivity provided by a short pulse based source is superior to that expected when using the conventional electron ionization based sources, in particular when the identification of optical isomers is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00340-008-3038-y|title=Ultra-fast laser pulses provide an ion source for highly selective mass spectroscopy|journal=Applied Physics B|volume=91|issue=3–4|pages=579|year=2008 |last1=Mehdi Sharifi |first1=S. |last2=Talebpour |first2=A. |last3=Chin |first3=S.

==Kramers-Henneberger frame and ionization phase effects==
Studying the strong field ionization of the atom in so called Kramers-Henneberger (K-H) frame&lt;ref name="henneberger"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Henneberger |first1=Walther C. |title=Perturbation method for atoms in intense laser beams |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=21 |issue=12 |date=1968 |pages=838–841|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.21.838|bibcode =  1968PhRvL..21..838H}}&lt;/ref&gt; leads to the conclusion that the ionization efficiency strongly depends on the temporal details of the ionizing pulse but not necessarily on the field strength and the total energy of the ionizing pulse pumped into the atom.&lt;ref name="mathur"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mathur |first1=D. |last2=Dota |first2=K. |last3=Dharmadhikari |first3=A.K. |last4=Dharmadhikari |first4=J.A. |title=Carrier-envelope-phase effects in ultrafast strong-field ionization dynamics of multielectron systems: Xe and CS2 |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=110 |issue=8 |date=2013 |pages=083602–083605 |issn= |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.083602 |bibcode=2013PhRvL.110h3602M|arxiv = 1301.3639 |pmid=23473143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kramers-Henneberger frame is the non-intertial frame moving with the free electron under the influence of the harmonic laser pulse. The free electron solution of the Newton equations for the electron in one dimension in the harmonic laser field
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\mathrm{d} t^2} = F \sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

will be also harmonic
:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = -\frac{F}{\omega^2} \sin(\omega t) = -a \sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

The frame comoving with this electron will be obtained by the coordinate transformation
:&lt;math&gt;x \to x + a \sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

while the added Coulomb potential will be
:&lt;math&gt;V(x) = -\frac{1}{\left|x + a \sin(\omega t)\right|}&lt;/math&gt;

The full cycle time-average of that potential which is 
:&lt;math&gt;V_{AV} = 
  -\frac{1}{2 \left|x + \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\right|}
  -\frac{1}{2 \left|x - \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\right|}
&lt;/math&gt;

will be the even function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and therefore having the maximum at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; while for that initial condition the solution will be &lt;math&gt;x(t)=0&lt;/math&gt; in the K-H and  it  will be therefore identical to the free electron solution in the laboratory frame. The electron velocity on the other hand is phase shifted both to the field strength and to the electron position: 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t} = -\frac{F}{\omega} \cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore considering the [[wavelet]] pulses and defining the ionization as the full escape from the line segment of the length 2r (or from the spherical region in three dimensions) the full ionization happens in the classical model after the time &lt;math&gt;r/(a \omega)&lt;/math&gt; or no ionization at all depending if the harmonic field wavelet is cut at the zero minimum or the maximum velocity.

==Dissociation – distinction==
A substance may [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] without necessarily producing ions. As an example, the molecules of table sugar dissociate in water (sugar is dissolved) but exist as intact neutral entities. Another subtle event is the dissociation of [[sodium chloride]] (table salt) into sodium and chlorine ions. Although it may seem as a case of ionization, in reality the ions already exist within the crystal lattice. When salt is dissociated, its constituent ions are simply surrounded by water molecules and their effects are visible (e.g. the solution becomes [[electrolytic]]). However, no transfer or displacement of electrons occurs. Actually, the chemical synthesis of salt involves ionization. This is a chemical reaction.

The '''Lisbon Oceanarium''' ({{lang-pt|Oceanário de Lisboa}}, {{IPA-pt|osiɐˈnaɾiu dɨ liʒˈboɐ|pron}}) is an [[oceanarium]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]. It is located in the ''[[Parque das Nações]]'', which was the exhibition grounds for the [[Expo '98]]. It is the largest indoor aquarium in Europe.&lt;ref name="size"/&gt;

== Architecture ==

The Lisbon Oceanarium’s conceptual design, architecture, and exhibit design was led by Peter Chermayeff of [[Peter Chermayeff LLC]] while at [[Cambridge Seven Associates]]. It is said to resemble an [[aircraft carrier]], and is built on a [[pier]] in an artificial lagoon. Chermayeff is also the designer of the [[Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan|Osaka Oceanarium]], one of the world's largest aquariums, and many other aquariums around the world.&lt;ref name="chermayeff"/&gt;

== Exhibits ==
[[File:Oceanario lisboa.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance view.]]
The Lisbon Oceanarium has a large collection of marine species — [[penguins]], [[seagulls]] and other [[birds]]; [[sea otters]] (mammals); [[sharks]], [[ray (fish)|rays]], [[chimaeras]], [[seahorse]]s and other [[bony fish]]; [[crustacean]]s; [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s and other [[echinoderms]]; [[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s and other [[cnidaria]]; [[octopus]]es, [[cuttlefish]], [[sea snail]]s and other [[mollusk]]s; [[amphibians]]; [[jellyfish]]; [[marine plants]] and [[terrestrial plant]]s and other marine organisms totaling about 16,000 individuals of 450 species.&lt;ref name="carvalho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oceanario"/&gt;

The main exhibit is a {{convert|1,000|m2|ft2|adj=on|abbr=on}}, {{convert|5,000,000|l|gal|adj=on|abbr=on}} tank with four large {{convert|49|m2|ft2|adj=on|abbr=on}} acrylic windows on its sides, and smaller focus windows strategically located around it to make sure it is a constant component throughout the exhibit space. It is {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep, which allows [[Pelagic fish|pelagic]] swimmers to swim above the bottom dwellers, and provides the illusion of the open ocean. About 100 species from around the world are kept in this tank,&lt;ref name="zoo_global_ocean"/&gt; including [[shark]]s, [[batoidea|rays]], [[barracuda]]s, [[grouper]]s, and [[moray eel]]s. One of the main attractions is a large [[Ocean sunfish|sunfish]].&lt;ref name="zoo_global_ocean2"/&gt;

[[File:Biggest fish in the aquarium.JPG|thumb|Ocean sunfish]]
Four tanks around the large central tank house four different habitats with their native flora and fauna: the [[North Atlantic]] rocky coast, the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] coastal line, the [[Temperate Northern Pacific|Temperate Pacific]] [[kelp forest]]s, and the [[Indian Ocean|Tropical Indian]] [[coral reefs]]. These tanks are separated from the central tank only by large sheets of acrylic to provide the illusion of a single large tank. Throughout the first floor there are an additional 25 thematic aquariums with each of the habitats' own characteristics.&lt;ref name="zoo_map"/&gt;

The Lisbon Oceanarium is one of the few aquariums in the world to house a [[Ocean sunfish|sunfish]], because of their unique and demanding requirements for care. Other interesting species include two large [[Maja squinado|spider crab]]s and two [[sea otter]]s named [[Eusébio]] after the soccer player and Amália, named after the fado singer [[Amália Rodrigues]].

[[Image:Bristol ag from csb 041004.jpg|alt=River flowing through gorge with wooded sides. On the right hand bank is a road|thumb|300px|right|A view of the [[Avon Gorge]], designated as an SSSI for both its biological and its geological interest]]&lt;onlyinclude&gt; &lt;!-- See [[Wikipedia talk:Featured lists]] for an explanation of this and other inclusion tags below. --&gt;This is a '''list of the [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) in the former county of [[Avon (county)|Avon]]''', England, United Kingdom. In England the body responsible for designating SSSIs is [[Natural England]], which chooses a site because of its [[fauna]], [[plant|flora]], [[geology|geological]] or physiographical features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification of SSSIs |work=English Nature |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |accessdate=2006-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515062100/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |archivedate=2012-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the county of Avon no longer exists, Natural England still uses its former borders to mark one of its [[Area of Search|Areas of Search]]. As of 2006, there are 86 sites designated in this [[Area of Search]], of which 38 have been designated due to their biological interest, 39 due to their geological interest, and 9 for both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SSSIs in Avon | work=English Nature | url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/searchresults.cfm?sssi_name=&amp;frmcounty=1001 | accessdate=2006-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;noinclude&gt;Natural England took over the role of designating and managing SSSIs from [[English Nature]] in October 2006 when it was formed from the amalgamation of English Nature, parts of the [[Countryside Agency]] and the [[Rural Development Service]]. Natural England, like its predecessor, uses the [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|1974–1996 county system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=County search of SSSIs |work=English Nature |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/search.cfm |accessdate=2006-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819192309/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/search.cfm |archivedate=2010-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such the same approach is followed here, rather than splitting these sites between the [[List of SSSIs in Somerset|Somerset]] and [[List of SSSIs in Gloucestershire|Gloucestershire]] lists. The data in the table is taken from English Nature in the form of citation sheets for each SSSI.&lt;ref name="data"&gt;''English Nature'' citation sheets for each SSSI ([[PDF]] files).

{{Wildlife of India}}
National parks in India are [[IUCN]] category II [[protected area]]s. [[India]]'s first [[national park]] was established in 1936 as Hailey National Park, now known as [[Jim Corbett National Park]], [[Uttarakhand]]. By 1970, India only had five national parks. In 1972, India enacted the [[Wildlife Protection Act]] and [[Project Tiger]] to safeguard the habitats of [[conservation reliant species]].

Further federal legislation strengthening protection for wildlife was introduced in the 1980s. As of July 2018, there were 104 national parks encompassing an area of {{convert|40501|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, comprising 1.23% of India's total surface area.&lt;ref name="wiienvis_8231"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wiienvis.nic.in/Database/npa_8231.aspx|title=National Parks|last=|first=|date=|website=wiienvis.nic.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
According to the Indian Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests, a national park is "[a]n area, whether within a sanctuary or not, [that] can be notified by the state government to be constituted as a National Park, by reason of its ecological, faunal, floral, geomorphological, or zoological association or importance, needed to for the purpose of protecting &amp; propagating or developing wildlife therein or its environment. No human activity is permitted inside the national park except for the ones permitted by the Chief Wildlife Warden of the state under the conditions given in CHAPTER IV, WPA 1972".&lt;ref name="wiienvis_8231" /&gt;

{{cleanup reorganize|date=August 2016}}
Diseases caused by [[pollution]] lead to the deaths of about 8.4 million people each year. "However, pollution receives a fraction of the interest from the global community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2014/06/in-developing-world-pollution-kills-more-than-disease/|title=In Developing World, Pollution Kills More Than Disease|last=Leahy|first=Stephen|date=June 13, 2014|work=|access-date=|via=IPS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in part because pollution causes so many diseases that it is often difficult to draw a straight line between cause and effect.

There are many different types of pollution-related diseases, including those caused by [[air pollution]], [[Soil contamination|contaminated soil]], [[water pollution]] and lacking [[WASH|water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)]].Air pollution can be reduced.

== Environmental Diseases vs. Pollution-Related Diseases ==
[[Environmental disease]]s are a direct result from the environment. This includes diseases caused by substance abuse, exposure to toxic chemicals, and physical factors in the environment, like UV radiation from the sun, as well as genetic predisposition. Meanwhile, pollution-related diseases are attributed to exposure to toxins in the air, water, and soil. Therefore, all pollution-related disease are environmental diseases, but not all environmental diseases are pollution-related diseases.

== Air pollution diseases ==
According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), [[air pollution]] is linked to 7 million premature deaths.  Here is a breakdown by the diseases air pollution causes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/|title=7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution|last=|first=|date=March 25, 2014|website=|publisher=World Heath Organization (WHO)|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outdoor air pollution ===
* 40% – [[ischaemic heart disease]]
* 40% – [[stroke]]
* 11% – [[chronic obstruction]]  pulmonary disease
* 6% - [[lung cancer]]
* 3% – acute [[lower respiratory infection]]s in children

=== Indoor air pollution ===
* 34% - stroke
* 26% - Coronary artery disease|ischaemic heart disease
* 22% - COPD (chronic obstruction pulmonary disease)
* 12% - acute [[Lower respiratory tract infection|lower respiratory infections]] in children
* 6% - [[lung cancer]]

== Water pollution==
According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC): "[[Waterborne diseases]] are caused by pathogenic microbes that can be directly spread through contaminated water. Most waterborne diseases cause diarrheal illness [Note: not all diseases listed below cause diarrhea]. Eighty-eight percent of diarrhea cases worldwide are linked to unsafe water, inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene. These cases result in 1.5 million deaths each year, mostly in young children. The usual cause of death is dehydration. Most cases of diarrheal illness and death occur in developing countries because of unsafe water, poor sanitation, and insufficient hygiene. Other waterborne diseases do not cause diarrhea; instead these diseases can cause malnutrition, skin infections, and organ damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/wash_diseases.html|title=Global WASH-Related Diseases and Contaminants|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=CDC|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Global Map of Martian Magnetic Anomalies PIA02059.jpg|thumb|Satellite measurements of the radial magnetic field on Mars.]]
In [[geophysics]], a '''magnetic anomaly''' is a local variation in the [[Earth's magnetic field]] resulting from variations in the chemistry or magnetism of the rocks. Mapping of variation over an area is valuable in detecting structures obscured by overlying material. The magnetic variation in successive bands of ocean floor parallel with [[mid-ocean ridge]]s is important evidence supporting the theory of [[seafloor spreading]], central to [[plate tectonics]].

==Measurement==
Magnetic anomalies are generally  a small fraction of the magnetic field. The total field ranges from 25,000 to 65,000&amp;nbsp;[[nanotesla]]s (nT).&lt;ref name=NGDC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/faqgeom.shtml |title=Geomagnetism Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To measure anomalies, [[magnetometer]]s need a sensitivity of 10 nT or less. There are three main types of magnetometer used to measure magnetic anomalies:&lt;ref name=Mussett&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mussett |first1=Alan E. |last2=Khan |first2=M. Aftab |chapter=11. Magnetic surveying |title=Looking into the earth: an introduction to geological geophysics |year=2000 |publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-78085-3 |pages=162–180 |edition=1. publ., repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|162–164}}&lt;ref name=Telford/&gt;{{rp|77–79}}

# The [[fluxgate magnetometer]] was developed during World War II to detect submarines.&lt;ref name=Telford/&gt;{{rp|75}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Raymond C. |title=Evidence from the earth: forensic geology and criminal investigation |date=2004 |publisher=Mountain press publ. company |location=Missoula (Mont.) |isbn=978-0-87842-498-6 |pages=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; It measures the component along a particular axis of the sensor, so it needs to be oriented. On land, it is often oriented vertically, while in aircraft, ships and satellites it is usually oriented so the axis is in the direction of the field. It measures the magnetic field continuously, but drifts over time. One way to correct for drift is to take repeated measurements at the same place during the survey.&lt;ref name=Mussett/&gt;{{rp|163–165}}&lt;ref name=Telford/&gt;{{rp|75–77}}
# The [[proton precession magnetometer]] measures the strength of the field but not its direction, so it does not need to be oriented. Each measurement takes a second or more. It is used in most ground surveys except for boreholes and high-resolution gradiometer surveys.&lt;ref name=Mussett/&gt;{{rp|163–165}}&lt;ref name=Telford/&gt;{{rp|77–78}}
# [[Optically pumped magnetometer]]s, which use alkali gases (most commonly [[rubidium]] and [[caesium]]) have high sample rates and sensitivities of 0.001&amp;nbsp;nT or less, but are more expensive than the other types of magnetometers. They are used on satellites and in most [[aeromagnetic survey]]s.&lt;ref name=Telford/&gt;{{rp|78–79}}

==Data acquisition==

===Ground-based===
In ground-based surveys, measurements are made at a series of stations, typically 15 to 60&amp;nbsp;m apart. Usually a proton precession magnetometer is used and it is often mounted on a pole. Raising the magnetometer reduces the influence of small ferrous objects that were discarded by humans. To further reduce unwanted signals, they do not carry objects such as keys, knives or compasses. In addition, objects such as motor vehicles, railway lines, and barbed wire fences are avoided. If some such contaminant is overlooked, it often shows up as a sharp spike in the anomaly, so such features are treated with suspicion. The main application for ground-based surveys is detailed search for minerals.&lt;ref name=Mussett/&gt;{{rp|163}}&lt;ref name=Telford/&gt;{{rp|83&amp;ndash;84}}

===Aeromagnetic===
{{Main|Aeromagnetic survey}}
[[File:Helicopter magnetometer.jpg|thumb|This helicopter is equipped with a magnetometer array. It flies six feet above ground at speeds of 30 to 40 mph.]]
Airborne magnetic surveys are often used in oil surveys to provide preliminary information for seismic surveys. In some countries such as Canada, government agencies have made systematic surveys of large areas. The survey generally involves making a series of parallel runs at a constant height and intervals of anywhere from a hundred meters to several kilometers. These are crossed by occasional tie lines, perpendicular to the main survey, to check for errors. The plane is a source of magnetism, so sensors are either mounted on a boom (as in the figure) or towed behind on a cable. Aeromagnetic surveys have a lower spatial resolution of ground surveys, but this can be an advantage for a regional survey of deeper rocks.&lt;ref name=Mussett/&gt;{{rp|166}}&lt;ref name=Telford/&gt;{{rp|81&amp;ndash;83}}

===Shipborne===
In shipborne surveys, a magnetometer is towed a few hundred meters behind a ship in a device called a ''fish''. The sensor is kept at a constant depth of about 15&amp;nbsp;m. Otherwise, the procedure is similar to that used in aeromagnetic surveys.&lt;ref name=Mussett/&gt;{{rp|167}}&lt;ref name=Telford/&gt;{{rp|83}}

===Spacecraft===
The [[Sputnik 3]] spacecraft in 1958 was the first to carry a magnetometer.&lt;ref name="Dicati"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dicati|first1=Renato|title=Stamping the Earth from Space|date=2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319207568}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Purucker|first=Michael E.|last2=Whaler|first2=Kathryn A. |chapter=6.

==Data reduction==
There are two main corrections that are needed for magnetic measurements. The first is remove short-term variations in the field from external sources. There are ''diurnal variations'' that have a period of 24&amp;nbsp;hours and magnitudes of up to 30&amp;nbsp;nT, probably from the action of the [[solar wind]] on the [[ionosphere]].&lt;ref name=Telford/&gt;{{rp|72}} In addition, [[magnetic storm]]s can have peak magnitudes of 1000&amp;nbsp;nT and can last for several days. Their contribution can be measured by returning to a base station repeatedly or by having another magnetometer that periodically measures the field at a fixed location.&lt;ref name=Mussett/&gt;{{rp|167}}

The anomaly is the local contribution to the magnetic field, so the main geomagnetic field must be subtracted from it. Usually the [[International Geomagnetic Reference Field]] is used for this purpose. This is a large-scale, time-averaged mathematical model of the Earth's field based on measurements from satellites, magnetic observatories and other surveys.&lt;ref name=Mussett/&gt;{{rp|167}}

Some corrections that are needed for [[gravity anomaly|gravity anomalies]] are less important for magnetic anomalies. For example, the vertical gradient of the magnetic field is 0.03&amp;nbsp;nT/m or less, so an elevation correction is generally not needed.&lt;ref name=Mussett/&gt;{{rp|167}}

The magnetization in the surveyed rock is a vector sum of induced and [[Remanence|remanent magnetization]]:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{M} = \mathbf{M}_\text{i} + \mathbf{M}_\text{r}.&lt;/math&gt;
The induced magnetization of many minerals is the product of the ambient magnetic field and their [[magnetic susceptibility]] {{math|&amp;chi;}}:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{M}_\text{i} = \chi \mathbf{H}. &lt;/math&gt;
Some susceptibilities are given in the table.

Minerals that are [[diamagnetism|diamagnetic]] or [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] only have an induced magnetization. [[Ferromagnetism|Ferromagnetic]] minerals such as [[magnetite]] also can carry a remanent magnetization or remanence. This remanence can last for millions of years, so it may be in a completely different direction from the present Earth's field. If a remanence is present, it is difficult to separate from the induced magnetization unless samples of the rock are measured. The ratio of the magnitudes, {{math|''Q'' {{=}} ''M''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;/''M''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is called the Koenigsberger ratio.&lt;ref name=Mussett/&gt;{{rp|172&amp;ndash;173}}&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=D.

==Applications==

===Ocean floor stripes===
[[File:Magnetic anomalies off west coast of North America.gif|thumb|upright|Magnetic anomalies around the Juan de Fuca and Gorda Ridges, off the west coast of North America, color-coded by age.]]
Magnetic surveys over the oceans have revealed a characteristic pattern of anomalies around mid-ocean ridges. They involve a series of positive and negative anomalies in the intensity of the magnetic field, forming stripes running parallel to each ridge. They are often symmetric about the axis of the ridge. The stripes are generally tens of kilometers wide, and the anomalies are a few hundred nanoteslas. The source of these anomalies is primarily permanent magnetization carried by titanomagnetite minerals in [[basalt]] and [[gabbro]]s. They are magnetized when ocean crust is formed at the ridge. As [[magma]] rises to the surface and cools, the rock acquires a [[thermoremanent magnetization]] in the direction of the field. Then the rock is carried away from the ridge by the motions of the [[tectonic plate]]s. Every few hundred thousand years, the direction of the magnetic field [[Geomagnetic reversal|reverses]]. Thus, the pattern of stripes is a global phenomenon and can be used to calculate the velocity of [[seafloor spreading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Merrill |first2=Michael W. |last2=McElhinny |first3=Phillip L. |last3=McFadden|first=Ronald T.|title=The magnetic field of the earth : paleomagnetism, the core, and the deep mantle|date=1996|publisher=Acad.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18073">[[File:Illustration of common periodicity of full spectrum and missing fundamental waveforms.jpg|thumb|400px|The bottom waveform is missing the fundamental frequency, 100 [[hertz]], and the second harmonic, 200 hertz. The periodicity is nevertheless clear when compared to the full-spectrum waveform on top.]]
A [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic]] [[sound]] is said to have a '''missing fundamental''', '''suppressed fundamental''', or '''phantom fundamental''' when its [[overtone]]s suggest a [[fundamental frequency]] but the sound lacks a component at the fundamental frequency itself.
The brain perceives the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of a tone not only by its fundamental frequency, but also by the periodicity implied by the relationship between the higher [[harmonic]]s; we may perceive the same pitch (perhaps with a different [[timbre]]) even if the fundamental frequency is missing from a tone.

For example, when a note (that is not a [[pure tone]]) has a [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of 100&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]], it will consist of frequency components that are integer multiples of that value (e.g. 100, 200, 300, 400, 500.... Hz). However, smaller loudspeakers may not produce low frequencies, and so in our example, the 100&amp;nbsp;Hz component may be missing. Nevertheless, a pitch corresponding to the fundamental may still be heard.

== Explanation ==
[[Image:Missing fundamental Fourier series 8.png|thumb|150px|The GCD of the frequency of all harmonics is the fundamental (dashed).]]

A low [[pitch (psychophysics)|pitch]] (also known as the pitch of the missing fundamental or virtual pitch) can sometimes be heard when there is no apparent source or component of that frequency. This perception is due to the brain interpreting repetition patterns that are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

It was once thought that this effect was because the missing fundamental was replaced by distortions introduced by the physics of the ear. However, experiments subsequently showed that when a noise was added that would have masked these distortions had they been present, listeners still heard a pitch corresponding to the missing fundamental, as reported by [[J. C. R. Licklider]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Music and Connectionism | author = Peter M. Todd and D.

The precise way in which it does so is still a matter of debate, but the processing seems to be based on an [[autocorrelation]] involving the timing of neural impulses in the auditory nerve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cariani|first=P.A.|author2=Delgutte, B.|title=Neural Correlates of the Pitch of Complex Tones.

The pitch of the missing fundamental, usually at the [[greatest common divisor]] of the frequencies present,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=D.A.|author2=Purves, D.|title=Pitch is determined by naturally occurring periodic sounds|journal=Hearing Research|date=May 2004|volume=194|issue=1–2|pages=31–46|doi=10.1016/j.heares.2004.01.019|pmid=15276674|url=http://www.purveslab.net/publications/schwarrtz_purves_pitch.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208222727/http://www.purveslab.net/publications/schwarrtz_purves_pitch.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-12-08|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not, however, always perceived.

The authors used structural [[MRI]] and [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] to show that the preference for missing fundamental hearing correlated with left-hemisphere lateralization of pitch perception, where the preference for spectral hearing correlated with right-hemisphere lateralization, and those who exhibited the latter preference tended to be musicians.

On-line sound examples comparing pure and complex tones and complexes with missing fundamentals [http://auditoryneuroscience.com/pitch/missing-fundamentals can be found here.]

[[Timpani]] (kettle drums) produce [[inharmonic]] overtones, but are constructed and tuned to produce near-harmonic overtones to an implied missing fundamental. Hit in the usual way (half to three-quarters the distance from the center to the rim), the fundamental note of a timpani is very weak in relation to its second through fifth "harmonic" overtones.&lt;ref name="H&amp;A"&gt;{{cite book |title=Acoustics and Psychoacoustics |last=Howard |first=David M. |author2=Jamie Angus |year=2006 |publisher=Focal Press |isbn=978-0-240-51995-1 |pages=200–3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yyk5nAIJcBcC }}&lt;/ref&gt; A timpani might be tuned to produce sound most strongly at 200, 302, 398, and 488&amp;nbsp;Hz, for instance, implying a missing fundamental at 100&amp;nbsp;Hz (though the actual dampened fundamental is 170&amp;nbsp;Hz).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~guymoore/ph224/notes/lecture26.pdf McGill University. Physics Department. Guy D. Moore. ''Lecture 26: Percussion'']. "The sequence 1; 1:51; 1:99; 2:44; 2:89 is almost 1; 1:5; 2; 2:5; 3 which is the harmonic series of
a missing fundamental."&lt;!--1x100x2=200--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[violin]]'s lowest air and body resonances generally fall between 250&amp;nbsp;Hz and 300&amp;nbsp;Hz. The fundamental frequency of the open [[Scientific pitch notation|G3]] string is below 200&amp;nbsp;Hz in modern tunings as well as [[concert pitch#Pitch inflation|most historical tunings]], so the lowest notes of a violin have an attenuated fundamental, although listeners seldom notice this.

The fundamental frequency is not normally heard on [[acoustic guitar]]s, [[classical guitar]]s and other stringed instruments with one end of the strings anchored on a soundboard [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] which has a low profile, holding the strings close to the soundboard surface. In these cases, the lateral string vibration has no discernable effect on the bridge; instead, the bridge is excited by changes in string tension, which are twice the lateral wave frequency. On these instruments, listeners hear the first harmonic as the lowest note. [[Electric guitar]]s are not like this; the fundamental frequency of each string is heard because the lateral string movement excites the [[Pickup (music technology)|electric pickups]] underneath the vibrating string.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guitarmasterworks.com/about-guitar-acoustics-101.html |title=Guitar acoustics 101-from a talk to the Seattle University Physics Club |last1=Decker, Jr |first1=John A |last2= |first2= |date=22 February 2007 |website=http://www.guitarmasterworks.com |publisher= |access-date=21 September 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most common [[telephones]] cannot reproduce sounds lower than 300&amp;nbsp;Hz, but a male voice has a fundamental frequency approximately 150&amp;nbsp;Hz. Because of the missing fundamental effect, the fundamental frequencies of male voices are still perceived as their pitches over the telephone.&lt;ref name="Mather 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mather |first=George |title=Foundations of perception |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2006 |pages= |page=125 |isbn=978-0-86377-835-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LYA9faq3lt4C&amp;pg=PA125 |accessdate=May 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The missing fundamental phenomenon is used electronically by some pro audio manufacturers to allow sound systems to seem to produce notes that are lower in pitch than they are capable of reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wavescaraudio.com/htmls/maxxbass.htm Waves Car Audio. ''MaxxBass Bass Enhancement Technology'']&lt;/ref&gt; In a hardware [[effects unit]] or a software plugin, a [[Audio crossover|crossover filter]] is set at a low frequency above which the sound system is capable of safely reproducing tones. Musical signal content above the high-pass part of the crossover filter is sent to the main output which is amplified by the sound system. Low frequency content below the low-pass part of the crossover filter is sent to a circuit where harmonics are synthesized above the low notes. The newly created harmonics are mixed back into the main output to create a perception of the filtered-out low notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|5930373|Method and system for enhancing quality of sound signal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a device with this synthetic process can reduce complaints from low frequency noise carrying through walls and it can be employed to reduce low frequency content in loud music that might otherwise vibrate and damage breakable valuables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://srforums.prosoundweb.com/index.php/m/335893/72/ |title=ProSoundWeb.

Some [[pipe organ]]s makes use of this phenomenon as a [[resultant tone]], which allows relatively smaller bass pipes to produce very low-pitched sounds.

==Audio processing applications==

This very concept of "missing fundamental" being reproduced based on the overtones in the tone has been used to create the illusion of bass in sound systems that are not capable of such bass. In mid-1999, Meir Shashoua of [[Tel Aviv]], co-founder of [[Waves Audio]], patented an algorithm to create the sense of the missing fundamental by synthesizing higher harmonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|5930373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waves Audio released the MaxxBass [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] to allow computer users to apply the synthesized harmonics to their audio files. Later, Waves Audio produced small [[subwoofer]]s that relied on the missing fundamental concept to give the illusion of low bass.&lt;ref name="Maximum PC 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norem |first=Josh |date=May 2004 |title=MaxxBass MiniWoofer |journal=Maximum PC |page=78 |issn=1522-4279 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAIAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=%22missing+fundamental%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22missing%20fundamental%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=May 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both products processed certain overtones selectively to help small loudspeakers, ones which could not reproduce low-frequency components, to sound as if they were capable of low bass. Both products included a [[high-pass filter]] which greatly attenuated all the low frequency tones that were expected to be beyond the capabilities of the target sound system.&lt;ref name="Bundschuh 2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maxx.com/objects/PDF/Loudspeaker_U-MaxxBass_with_High_BL.pdf |title=MaxxBass Applications for Small, Full Range Loudspeakers |last=Bundschuh |first=Paul |date=April 15–17, 2004 |website=Loudspeaker University |publisher=Waves Audio |accessdate=May 11, 2010|location=Nashua, New Hampshire }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a popular song that was recorded with MaxxBass processing is "[[Lady Marmalade]]", the 2001 Grammy award-winning version sung by [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Lil' Kim]], [[Mýa]], and [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], produced by [[Missy Elliott]].&lt;ref name="Bundschuh 2004"/&gt;

Other software and hardware companies have developed their own versions of missing fundamental-based bass augmentation products. The poor bass reproduction of [[Headphones|earbuds]] has been identified as a possible target for such processing.&lt;ref name="Arora 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arora |first=Manish |author2=Seongcheol Jang |author3=Hangil Moon  |date=September 2006 |title=Low Complexity Virtual Bass Enhancement Algorithm For Portable Multimedia Device |journal=AES Conference |url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=13868 |accessdate=May 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many computer sound systems are not capable of low bass, and songs offered to consumers via computer have been identified as ones that may benefit from augmented bass harmonics processing.&lt;ref name="Houghton 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Houghton |first=Matt |date=April 2007 |title=Better Bass: The Complete Guide To Recording, Mixing &amp; Monitoring The Low End |journal=Sound on Sound |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr07/articles/betterbass.htm |accessdate=May 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States '''National Centers for Environmental Information''' ('''NCEI'''), headquartered in [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], [[North Carolina]], is the world's largest active [[archive]] of [[environmental data]].  In 2015 it was established from the merger of the [[National Climatic Data Center]] (NCDC), the [[National Geophysical Data Center]] (NGDC) and the [[National Oceanographic Data Center]] (NODC).&lt;ref name="ncei.noaa.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/about | title=About the National Centers for Environmental Information | publisher=NCEI | accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current director is Mary Wohlgemuth.

==Merger==
The establishment of NCEI was rooted in the dramatic increase in the demand for environmental data and information in the years preceding 2015. In order to meet the demand, the three existing data centers are merged in accordance with the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, Public Law 113-235:&lt;ref name="ncei.noaa.gov" /&gt;
# [[National Climatic Data Center]] (NCDC)
# [[National Geophysical Data Center]] (NGDC)
# [[National Oceanographic Data Center]] (NODC), which includes the [[National Coastal Data Development Center]] (NCDDC)

NCEI was launched on April 22, 2015.&lt;ref name="ncdc.noaa.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/news/national-centers-environmental-information | title=National Centers for Environmental Information | publisher=NCDC | date=April 22, 2015 | accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition is expected to finish beyond 2020, while at the meantime none of the existing products and services will be affected by the merger.&lt;ref name="ncei.noaa.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/news/coming-soon-national-centers-environmental-information | title=Coming Soon: NCEI | publisher=NCDC | date=April 3, 2015 | accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing URLs, links and domain names for the data centers will remain accessible, even though a plan will be developed to consolidate the domains, also any change will be advertised and appropriate redirects will be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/about | title=About Us | publisher=NCDC | accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ossë''' ({{IPA-art|ˈosse|}}; from the [[Valarin]] '''Ošošai''', '''Oššai''') is a fictional character in the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. He is introduced in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' as an angelic being known as a [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maia]], associated with [[Ulmo]], one of the [[Valar]] (analogous to [[archangel]]s).

A spirit of the sea in the service of Ulmo, Ossë guarded the waters around [[Middle-earth]]. He was married to [[Uinen]], and he was a friend of [[Círdan]] the Shipwright. During the [[Years of the Trees]], he briefly entered into the service of [[Morgoth|Melkor]] and began causing wanton storms which made traveling by sea particularly unsafe. He was persuaded to stop by his spouse Uinen, upon the prayer of the Vala Aulë, but Ossë's taste for storms did not quite disappear.

Ossë was a friend of the [[Sindar]], and was valued as high as the Valar by them.
This relationship started before the coming of the Sindar to [[Valinor]], while they dwelled on shores of Middle-earth, waiting for their leader. It was against Ossë's will that they ever went to Valinor.

In older versions of ''The Silmarillion'', Ossë was a Vala in his own right, and often opposed a Maia of Ulmo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9480">The '''photoacoustic Doppler effect''', as its name implies, is one specific kind of [[Doppler effect]], which occurs when an intensely modulated light wave induces a [[Photoacoustic microscopy|photoacoustic]] wave on moving particles with a specific [[frequency]]. The observed frequency shift is a good indicator of the velocity of the illuminated moving particles. A potential biomedical application is measuring blood flow.

Specifically, when an intensity modulated [[light wave]] is exerted on a localized medium, the resulting heat can induce an alternating and localized pressure change. This periodic pressure change generates an acoustic wave with a specific frequency. Among various factors that determine this frequency, the velocity of the heated area and thus the moving particles in this area can induce a frequency shift proportional to the relative motion. Thus, from the perspective of an observer, the observed frequency shift can be used to derive the velocity of illuminated moving particles.&lt;ref name=bopi&gt;{{cite book

==Theory==

To be simple, consider a clear medium firstly. The medium contains small optical absorbers moving with velocity vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt;.  The absorbers are irradiated by a laser with intensity modulated at frequency &lt;math&gt;f_{0}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Thus, the intensity of the [[laser]] could be described by:

&lt;math&gt;I={I }_{0 }  \left[   1+cos \left ( 2 \pi  f_{0}t \right ) \right ] /2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=prl&gt;H. Fang, K. Maslov, L.V. Wang.  "Photoacoustic Doppler Effect from Flowing Small Light-Absorbing Particles." Physical Review Letters 99, 184501 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:schematic.jpg|frame|right|50px|'''Figure 1: Overview of PAD Effect'''&lt;ref name=prl/&gt;
]]

When &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; is zero, an [[acoustic wave]] with the same frequency &lt;math&gt;f_{0}&lt;/math&gt; as the light intensity wave is induced. Otherwise, there is a frequency shift in the induced acoustic wave.  The magnitude of the frequency shift depends on the relative velocity &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt;, the angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; between the velocity and the photon density wave propagation direction, and the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; between the velocity and the ultrasonic wave propagation direction.  
The frequency shift is given by:

&lt;math&gt;f_{PAD}=-f_{0} \frac{ v}{ c_{0}} cos \alpha  +f_{0} \frac{v}{c_{a}} cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="prl"/&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;c_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light in the medium and &lt;math&gt;c_{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of sound.  The first term on the right side of the expression represents the frequency shift in the photon density wave observed by the absorber acting as a moving receiver.  The second term represents the frequency shift in the photoacoustic wave due to the motion of the absorbers observed by the [[ultrasonic transducer]].&lt;ref name="prl"/&gt;

In practice, since &lt;math&gt;\frac{c_{0}}{c_{a}}\sim 10^{5}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v \ll c_{a}&lt;/math&gt;, only the second term is detectable.  Therefore, the above equation reduces to:

&lt;math&gt;f_{PAD}=  f_{0} \frac{v}{c_{a}} cos \theta = \frac{v}{\lambda} cos \theta &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="prl"/&gt;&lt;ref name=apl&gt;H. Fang, K. Maslov, L.V. Wang. "Photoacoustic Doppler flow measurement in optically scattering media." Applied Physics Letters 91 (2007) 264103&lt;/ref&gt;

In this approximation, the frequency shift is not affected by the direction of the optical radiation. It is only affected by the magnitude of velocity and the angle between the velocity and the acoustic wave propagation direction.&lt;ref name="prl"/&gt;

This equation also holds for a scattering medium. In this case, the photon density wave becomes diffusive due to light scattering. Although the diffusive photon density wave has a slower phase velocity than the speed of light, its wavelength is still much longer than the acoustic wave.&lt;ref name="apl"/&gt;

==Experiment==

[[Image:Scat-data.JPG|frame|right|40px|'''Figure 2: Average Photoacoustic Doppler Shift vs. Velocity for a Scattering Medium ''' &lt;ref name="apl"/&gt;]]

In the first demonstration of the Photoacoustic Doppler effect, a continuous wave [[laser diode|diode laser]] was used in a [[photoacoustic imaging in biomedicine|photoacoustic microscopy]] setup with an [[ultrasonic transducer]] as the detector.  The sample was a solution of absorbing particles moving through a tube. The tube was in a water bath containing scattering particles&lt;ref name="prl"/&gt;

Figure 2 shows a relationship between average flow velocity and the experimental photoacoustic Doppler frequency shift.  In a scattering medium, such as the experimental phantom, fewer photons reach the absorbers than in an optically clear medium.  This affects the signal intensity but not the magnitude of the frequency shift.  Another demonstrated feature of this technique is that it is capable of measuring flow direction relative to the detector based on the sign of the frequency shift.&lt;ref name="prl"/&gt;  The reported minimum detected flow rate is 0.027&amp;nbsp;mm/s in the scattering medium.&lt;ref name="apl"/&gt;

==Application==

One promising application is the non-invasive measurement of flow. This is related to an important problem in medicine: the measurement of blood flow through [[arteries]], [[capillaries]], and [[veins]].&lt;ref name="apl"/&gt;  Measuring blood velocity in capillaries is an important component to clinically determining how much oxygen is delivered to tissues and is potentially important to the diagnosis of a variety of diseases including [[diabetes]] and [[cancer]].However, a particular difficulty of measuring flow velocity in [[capillaries]] is caused by the low blood flow rate and micrometre-scale diameter. Photoacoustic Doppler effect based imaging is a promising method for blood flow measurement in capillaries.

=== Existing techniques ===

Based on either [[ultrasound]] or light there are several techniques currently being used to measure [[blood]] velocity in a clinical setting or other types of flow velocities.

====Doppler ultrasound====

The [[Doppler ultrasound]] technique uses Doppler frequency shifts in ultrasound wave.  This technique is currently used in biomedicine to measure blood flow in [[arteries]] and [[veins]].  It is limited to high flow rates (&lt;math&gt;&gt;1 &lt;/math&gt;cm/s) generally found in large vessels due to the high background ultrasound signal from biological tissue.&lt;ref name="apl"/&gt;

====Laser doppler flowmetry====

[[Laser Doppler velocimetry|Laser Doppler Flowmetry]] utilizes light instead of [[ultrasound]] to detect flow velocity.  The much shorter optical wavelength means this technology is able to detect low flow velocities out of the range of [[Doppler ultrasound]].  But this technique is limited by high background noise and low signal due to [[multiple scattering]].  Laser Doppler flowmetry can measure only the averaged blood speed within 1mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; without information about flow direction.&lt;ref name="apl"/&gt;

====Doppler optical coherence tomography====

Doppler [[Optical coherence tomography]] is an optical flow measurement technique that improves on the spatial resolution of laser Doppler flowmetry by rejecting [[scattering|multiple scattering light]] with coherent gating.  This technique is able to detect flow velocity as low as &lt;math&gt;100 \mu &lt;/math&gt;m/s with the spatial resolution of &lt;math&gt;5\times 5\times 15\mu &lt;/math&gt;m&lt;math&gt;^{3}&lt;/math&gt;.  The detection depth is usually limited by the high optical scattering coefficient of biological tissue to &lt;math&gt;&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;mm.&lt;ref name="apl"/&gt;

===Photoacoustic doppler flowmetry===

Photoacoustic Doppler effect can be used to measure the blood flow velocity with the advantages of [[Photoacoustic imaging in biomedicine|Photoacoustic imaging]]. [[Photoacoustic imaging in biomedicine|Photoacoustic imaging]] combines the spatial resolution of [[ultrasound]] imaging with the contrast of optical absorption in deep biological tissue.&lt;ref name="bopi"/&gt;  [[Ultrasound]] has good spatial [[Image resolution|resolution]] in deep biological tissue since ultrasonic scattering is much weaker than optical scattering, but it is insensitive to biochemical properties. Conversely, optical imaging is able to achieve high [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] in biological tissue via high sensitivity to small molecular optical absorbers, such as [[hemoglobin]] found in [[red blood cells]], but its spatial resolution is compromised by the strong [[scattering]] of light in biological tissue. By combining the optical imaging with ultrasound, it is possible to achieve both high contrast and spatial resolution.&lt;ref name="bopi"/&gt;

The photoacoustic Doppler flowmetry could use the power of photoacoustics to measure flow velocities that are usually inaccessible to pure light-based or ultrasound techniques.  The high spatial resolution could make it possible to pinpoint only a few absorbing particles localized to a single capillary. High contrast from the strong optical absorbers make it possible to clearly resolve the signal from the absorbers over the background.

{{Labor|sp=us}}
The '''proletariat''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|r|oʊ|l|ɪ|ˈ|t|ɛər|i|ə|t}} from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|proletarius}} "producing offspring") is the [[Social class|class]] of [[Wage labor|wage-earner]]s in an economic society whose only possession of significant material value is their [[labour-power]] (how much work they can do).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/proletariat proletariat]. Accessed: 6 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A member of such a class is a '''proletarian'''.

In [[Marxist theory]], a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] is for the proletariat, of the proletariat, and by the proletariat. On the Marxist view, this will endow the proletarian with the power to abolish the conditions that make a person a proletarian and, thus, build [[communism]].

== {{lang|la|Proletarii}} of the Roman Republic ==
{{See|Constitution of the Roman Republic}}
The {{lang|la|proletarii}} constituted a [[social class in ancient Rome|social class of Roman citizens]] owning little or no property. The origin of the name is presumably linked with the [[census]], which Roman authorities conducted every five years to produce a register of citizens and their property from which their military duties and voting privileges could be determined. For citizens with property valued 11,000 {{lang|la|[[as (Roman coin)|assēs]]}} or less, which was below the lowest census for military service, their children—{{lang|la|proles}} (from Latin {{lang|la|prōlēs}}, "offspring")—were listed instead of their property; hence, the name {{lang|la|proletarius}}, "the one who produces offspring". The only contribution of a {{lang|la|proletarius}} to the Roman society was seen in his ability to raise children, the future Roman citizens who can colonize new territories conquered by the [[Roman Republic]] and later by the [[Roman Empire]]. The citizens who had no property of significance were called {{lang|la|[[capite censi]]}} because they were "persons registered not as to their property...but simply as to their existence as living individuals, primarily as heads ({{lang|la|caput}}) of a family."&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law'' (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society 1953) at 380; 657.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold J. Toynbee]], especially in his ''[[A Study of History]]'', uses the word "proletariat" in this general sense of people without property or a stake in society. Toynbee focuses particularly on the generative spiritual life of the "internal proletariat" (those living within a given civil society). He also describes the "heroic" folk legends of the "external proletariat" (poorer groups living outside the borders of a civilization). Compare Toynbee, ''A Study of History'' (Oxford University 1934–1961), 12 volumes, in Volume V ''Disintegration of Civilizations, part one'' (1939) at 58–194 (internal proletariat), and at 194–337 (external proletariat).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Working man-obrero 2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A [[manual labor]]er at work in [[Venezuela]]. Manual laborers are generally considered to be part of the proletariat.]]
Although included in one of the five support {{lang|la|[[centuria]]e}} of the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}} (English: [[Centuriate Assembly]]), {{lang|la|proletarii}} were largely deprived of their voting rights due to their low social status caused by their lack of "even the minimum property required for the lowest class"&lt;ref&gt;Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law'' (1953) at 351; 657 (quote).&lt;/ref&gt; and a class-based hierarchy of the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}}. The late Roman historians, such as [[Livy]], not without some uncertainty, understood the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}} to be one of three forms of popular assembly of early Rome composed of {{lang|la|centuriae}}, the voting units whose members represented a class of citizens according to the value of their property. This assembly, which usually met on the {{lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]|italic=no}} to discuss public policy issues, was also used as a means of designating military duties demanded of Roman citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Titus Livius ({{circa|59 BC}} – AD 17), ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1, 43; the first five books translated by Aubrey de Sélincourt as Livy, ''The Early History of Rome'' (Penguin 1960, 1971) at 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; One of reconstructions of the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}} features 18 {{lang|la|centuriae}} of cavalry, and 170 {{lang|la|centuriae}} of infantry divided into five classes by wealth, plus 5 {{lang|la|centuriae}} of support personnel called {{lang|la|[[adsidui]]}}. The top infantry class assembled with full arms and armor; the next two classes brought arms and armor, but less and lesser; the fourth class only spears; the fifth slings. In voting, the cavalry and top infantry class were enough to decide an issue; as voting started at the top, an issue might be decided before the lower classes voted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lintott]], ''The Constitution of the Roman Republic'' (Oxford University 1999) at 55–61, re the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last centuries of the [[Roman Republic]] (509–44 BC), the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}} became impotent as a political body, which further eroded already minuscule political power the {{lang|la|proletarii}} might have had in the Roman society.

Following a series of wars the Roman Republic engaged since the closing of the [[Second Punic War]] (218–201 BC), such as the [[Jugurthine War]] and conflicts in Macedonia and Asia, the significant reduction in the number of Roman family farmers had resulted in the shortage of people whose property qualified them to perform the citizenry's [[political history of the Roman military|military duty to Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [[Theodor Mommsen]], {{lang|de|[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|Römisches Geschichte]]|italic=yes}} (1854–1856), 3 volumes; translated as ''History of Rome'' (1862–1866), 4 volumes; reprint (The Free Press 1957) at vol. III: 48–55 (Mommsen's Bk. III, ch. XI toward end).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the [[Marian reforms]] initiated in 107 BC by the Roman general [[Gaius Marius]] (157–86), the {{lang|la|proletarii}} became the backbone of the [[Roman army]].&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Scullard, ''Gracchi to Nero. A History of Rome from 133 BC to AD 68'' (London: Methuen 1959, 4th ed. 1976) at 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]], who studied [[Roman law]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [[Sidney Hook]], ''Marx and the Marxists'' (Princeton: Van Nostrand 1955) at 13.&lt;/ref&gt; used the term ''proletariat'' in his socio-political theory of [[Marxism]] to describe a [[working class]] unadulterated by [[private property]] and capable of a revolutionary action to topple [[capitalism]] in order to create [[classless society]]. Marx most likely encountered the term while studying the works of the liberal economist and historian {{lang|fr|[[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]]|italic=no}}, who was the first to apply it to the working class created under capitalism, and whose writings were frequently cited by Marx.&lt;ref name="Ekins"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ekins |first1=Paul |last2=Max-Neef |first2=Manfred |title=Real Life Economics |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |pages=91-93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ekelund Jr |first1=Robert B. |last2=Hébert |first2=Robert F. |title=A History of Economic Theory and Method: Fifth Edition |date=2006 |publisher=Waveland Press |page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lutz"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lutz |first1=Mark A. |title=Economics for the Common Good: Two Centuries of Economic Thought in the Humanist Tradition |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |pages=55-57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gareth"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stedman Jones |first1=Gareth |editor1-last=Aprile |editor1-first=Sylvie |editor2-last=Bensimon |editor2-first=Fabrice |title=La France et l’Angleterre au XIXe siècle.

==Marxist theory==
{{Marxism |Concepts}}
In [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, the proletariat is the [[social class]] that does not have ownership of the [[means of production]] and whose only means of subsistence is to sell their [[labor power]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Das Kapital, Kritik der politischen Ökonomie|trans-title=Capital: Critique of Political Economy|year=1887|publisher=Progress Publishers|location=Moscow|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm|authorlink=Karl Marx|editor=Frederick Engels|accessdate=10 February 2013|chapter=Chapter Six: The Buying and Selling of Labour-Power}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[wage]] or [[salary]]. Proletarians are wage-workers, while some refer to those who receive salaries as the ''salariat''. For [[Marx]], however, wage labor may involve getting a salary rather than a wage ''per se''. Marxism sees the proletariat and [[bourgeoisie]] (capitalist class) as occupying conflicting positions, since workers automatically wish their wages to be as high as possible, while owners and their proxies wish for wages (costs) to be as low as possible.

[[File:Pyramid of Capitalist System.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A 1911 ''[[Industrial Worker]]'' publication advocating industrial unionism based on a critique of capitalism. The proletariat "work for all" and "feed all".]]
In Marxist theory, the borders between the proletariat and some layers of the [[petite bourgeoisie]], who rely primarily but not exclusively on self-employment at an income no different from an ordinary wage or below it – and the [[lumpenproletariat]], who are not in legal employment – are not necessarily well defined. Intermediate positions are possible, where some wage-labor for an employer combines with self-employment. Marx makes a clear distinction between proletariat as salaried workers, which he sees as a progressive class, and [[Lumpenproletariat]], "rag-proletariat", the poorest and outcasts of the society, such as beggars, tricksters, entertainers, buskers, criminals and prostitutes, which he considers a retrograde class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9049344/Lumpenproletariat Lumpen proletariat –  Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Manifesto of the Communist Party|date=February 1848|publisher=Progress Publishers|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm|accessdate=10 February 2013|chapter=Bourgeois and Proletarians}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socialism|Socialist]] parties have often struggled over the question of whether they should seek to organize and represent all the lower classes, or just the wage-earning proletariat.

According to Marxism, [[capitalism]] is a system based on the [[Exploitation of labor|exploitation]] of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie. This exploitation takes place as follows: the workers, who own no [[means of production]] of their own, must use the means of production that are property of others in order to produce, and consequently earn, their living. Instead of hiring those means of production, they themselves get hired by capitalists and work for them, producing goods or services. These goods or services become the property of the capitalist, who sells them at the market.

One part of the wealth produced is used to pay the workers' wages (variable costs), another part to renew the means of production (constant costs) while the third part, [[surplus value]] is split between the capitalist's private takings (profit), and the money used to pay rents, taxes, interests, etc. Surplus value is the difference between the wealth that the proletariat produces through its work, and the wealth it consumes to survive and to provide labor to the capitalist companies.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. The Capital, volume 1, chapter 6. http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A part of the surplus value is used to renew or increase the means of production, either in quantity or quality (i.e., it is turned into [[Capital (economics)|capital]]), and is called capitalized surplus value.&lt;ref&gt;Luxemburg, Rosa. [[The Accumulation of Capital]]. Chapter 6, Enlarged Reproduction, http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1913/accumulation-capital/ch06.htm&lt;/ref&gt; What remains is consumed by the capitalist class.

The commodities that proletarians produce and capitalists sell are valued for the amount of [[labor (economics)|labor]] embodied in them. The same goes for the workers' [[labor power]] itself: it is valued, not for the amount of wealth it produces, but for the amount of labor necessary to produce and reproduce it. Thus the capitalists earn wealth from the labor of their employees, not as a function of their personal contribution to the productive process, which may even be null, but as a function of the juridical relation of property to the means of production. Marxists argue that new wealth is created through labor applied to [[natural resource]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. [[Critique of the Gotha Programme]], I. http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx argued that the proletariat would displace the capitalist system with the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], abolishing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a [[communist]] society in which "the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. [[The Communist Manifesto]], part II, Proletarians and Communists http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prole drift==
Prole drift, short for proletarian drift, is the tendency in advanced industrialized societies for everything inexorably to become proletarianized, or to become commonplace and commodified. This trend is attributed to mass production, mass selling, mass communication and mass education. Examples include best-seller lists, films and music that must appeal to the masses, and shopping malls.&lt;ref name="class"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fussell|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Fussell|title=Class, A Guide Through the American Status System|publisher=Ballantine|date=October 1992|location=New York|isbn=978-0-345-31816-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPbF1kuayJYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radiation implosion''' is the compression of a target by the use of high levels of [[electromagnetic radiation]].  The major use for this technology is in [[fusion bomb]]s and [[inertial confinement fusion]] research.

==History==
{{see also|History of the Teller-Ulam design}}
Radiation implosion was first developed by [[Klaus Fuchs]] and [[John von Neumann]] in the United States, as part of their work on the original "Classical Super" hydrogen bomb design. Their work resulted in a secret patent filed in 1946, and later given to the USSR by Fuchs as part of his [[nuclear espionage]]. However, their scheme was not the same as used in the final hydrogen bomb design, and neither the American nor the Soviet programs were able to make use of it directly in developing the hydrogen bomb (its value would become apparent only after the fact). A modified version of the Fuchs-von Neumann scheme was incorporated into the "George" shot of [[Operation Greenhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bernstein, "John von Neumann and Klaus Fuchs: an Unlikely Collaboration", ''Physics in Perspective'' 12, no. 1 (March 2010), 36-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, [[Stanislaw Ulam]] had the idea to use hydrodynamic shock of a fission weapon to compress more fissionable material to incredible densities in order to make megaton-range, two-stage fission bombs. He then realized that this approach might be useful for starting a thermonuclear reaction. He presented the idea to [[Edward Teller]], who realized that radiation compression would be both faster and more efficient than mechanical shock. This combination of ideas, along with a fission "sparkplug" embedded inside of the fusion fuel, became what is known as the [[Teller–Ulam design]] for the hydrogen bomb.

==Fission bomb radiation source==
Most of the energy released by a [[fission bomb]] is in the form of [[x-rays]]. The spectrum is approximately that of a [[black body]] at a temperature of 50,000,000 [[kelvin]]s (a little more than three times&lt;!-- 50÷15.7 ≈ 3.18 --&gt; the temperature of the [[Sun]]'s core). The amplitude can be modeled as a trapezoidal pulse with a one microsecond rise time, one microsecond plateau, and one microsecond fall time. For a 30 kiloton fission bomb, the total x-ray output would be 100 [[terajoule]]s.

==Radiation transport==
In a [[Teller-Ulam]] bomb, the object to be imploded is called the "secondary".  It contains fusion material, such as [[lithium hydride|lithium deuteride]], and its outer layers are a material which is opaque to x-rays, such as [[lead]] or [[uranium-238]].

In order to get the x-rays from the surface of the primary, the fission bomb, to the surface of the secondary, a system of "x-ray reflectors" is used.

The reflector is typically a cylinder made of a material such as uranium.  The primary is located at one end of the cylinder and the secondary is located at the other end.  The interior of the cylinder is commonly filled with a foam which is mostly transparent to x-rays, such as [[polystyrene]].  

The term reflector is misleading, since it gives the reader an idea that the device works like a [[mirror]]. Some of the x-rays are diffused or scattered, but the majority of the energy transport happens by a two-step process:  the x-ray reflector is heated to a high temperature by the flux from the primary, and then it emits x-rays which travel to the secondary.  Various classified methods are used to improve the performance of the reflection process{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}.

Some Chinese documents show that Chinese scientists used a different method to achieve radiation implosion. According to these documents, an X-ray lens, not a reflector, was used to transfer the energy from primary to secondary during the making of the first Chinese H-bomb.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see [http://www.math.mun.ca/~xzhao/chinesearticles/ZhangSC2011paper.doc Zhang paper]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The implosion process in nuclear weapons==
The term "radiation implosion" suggests that the secondary is crushed by [[radiation pressure]], and calculations show that while this pressure is very large, the pressure of the materials vaporized by the radiation is much larger. The outer layers of the secondary become so hot that they [[vaporize]] and fly off the surface at high speeds. The recoil from this surface layer ejection produces pressures which are an order of magnitude stronger than the simple radiation pressure. The so-called radiation implosion in thermonuclear weapons is therefore thought to be a radiation-powered [[ablation]]-drive implosion.

==Laser radiation implosions==
There has been much interest in the use of large [[laser]]s to ignite small amounts of fusion material.  This process is known as [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF). As part of that research, much information on radiation implosion technology has been declassified.

When using optical lasers, there is a distinction made between "direct drive" and "indirect drive" systems.  In a direct drive system, the laser beam(s) are directed onto the target, and the rise time of the laser system determines what kind of compression profile will be achieved.

In an indirect drive system, the target is surrounded by a shell (called a [[Hohlraum]]) of some intermediate-Z material, such as [[selenium]]. The laser heats this shell to a temperature such that it emits x-rays, and these x-rays are then transported onto the fusion target.  Indirect drive has various advantages, including better control over the spectrum of the radiation, smaller system size (the secondary radiation typically has a wavelength 100 times smaller than the driver laser), and more precise control over the compression profile.

[[File:Major Russian Gas Pipelines to Europe.svg|thumb|350px|Natural gas pipelines from Russia to Europe]]
The '''Russia–Ukraine gas disputes''' refer to a number of disputes between Ukrainian oil and gas company [[Naftogaz|Naftohaz Ukrayiny]] and Russian gas supplier [[Gazprom]] over [[natural gas]] supplies, prices, and debts. These disputes have grown beyond simple business disputes into transnational political issues—involving political leaders from several countries—that threaten natural gas supplies in numerous European countries dependent on natural gas imports from Russian suppliers, which are transported through [[Ukraine]]. Russia provides approximately a quarter of the natural gas consumed in the European Union; approximately 80% of those exports travel through pipelines across Ukrainian soil prior to arriving in the EU.&lt;ref name=BBC182009/&gt;

A serious dispute began in March 2005 over the price of natural gas supplied and the cost of transit. During this conflict, Russia claimed Ukraine was not paying for gas, but diverting that which was intended to be exported to the EU from the pipelines. Ukrainian officials at first denied the accusation,&lt;ref name=bbc010106&gt;
{{Cite news| title = Ukraine gas row hits EU supplies| publisher=BBC| date =1 January 2006| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4573572.stm|accessdate =16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc020106/&gt; but later Naftogaz admitted that natural gas intended for other European countries was retained and used for domestic needs. The dispute reached a high point on 1 January 2006, when Russia cut off all gas supplies passing through Ukrainian territory.&lt;ref name=bbc240106&gt;
{{Cite news| title = Ukraine takes extra Russian gas| publisher=BBC| date =24 January 2006| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4642684.stm|accessdate =16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January 2006, a preliminary agreement between Russia and Ukraine was achieved, and the supply was restored. The situation calmed until October 2007 when new disputes began over Ukrainian gas debts. This led to reduction of gas supplies in March 2008. During the last months of 2008, relations once again became tense when Ukraine and Russia could not agree on the debts owed by Ukraine.&lt;ref name="November"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ukraine - time to pay gas bills |publisher=Russia Today |date=26 November 2008 |url=http://www.russiatoday.com/news/news/33776 |accessdate=17 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123134151/http://www.russiatoday.com/news/news/33776 |archivedate=23 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, this disagreement resulted in supply disruptions in many European nations, with eighteen European countries reporting major drops in or complete cut-offs of their gas supplies transported through Ukraine from Russia.&lt;ref name=reutersfactbox712009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Leo|last=Cendrowicz |date=9 January 2009 |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1870597,00.html |title=Russia-Europe Gas Spat Ends—For Now |work=Time |accessdate=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009 officials from both countries stated they felt the situation was under control and that there would be no more conflicts over the topic,&lt;ref name="Reuters792009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Ukraine intended to import less gas in 2010 as a result of reduced industry needs because of its [[2008–2009 Ukrainian financial crisis|economic recession]]; however, Gazprom insisted that Ukraine fulfill its contractual obligations and purchase the previously agreed upon quantities of gas.&lt;ref name="Kyiv Post8102009"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom disagree on 2010 imports| publisher=[[Kyiv Post]]| date =8 October 2009| url= http://www.kyivpost.com/nation/50341| accessdate =8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June 2010, a Stockholm court of arbitration ruled [[Naftohaz]] of Ukraine must return {{convert|12.1|e9m3|abbr=off}} of gas to [[RosUkrEnergo]], a [[Switzerland|Swiss-based]] company in which Gazprom controls a 50% stake.

==Historical background==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}
After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], oil import prices to Ukraine reached world market levels in 1993. However, gas import prices and transit fees remained below European levels for Russian exports to Europe through pipelines in Ukraine; these were set in bilateral negotiations.&lt;ref name=pirani&gt;{{Cite book| title = Ukraine's Gas Sector| last = Pirani| first = Simon| publisher = [[Oxford Institute for Energy Studies]]| year = 2007| url = http://www.oxfordenergy.org/pdfs/NG21.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = 21 December 2008| isbn = 978-1-901795-63-9| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080527194203/http://www.oxfordenergy.org/pdfs/NG21.pdf| archivedate = 27 May 2008| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time Ukraine remained the main transit corridor for Russia's gas export.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The gas trading system differed substantially from the gas sale to the European Union and caused problems in the form of large-scale deliveries of relatively cheap Russian gas causing an increase of energy-intensive industries and supporting Ukraine's status as one of the world's least [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] countries and largest gas importers, the accumulation of Ukrainian debts and non-payment of same, unsanctioned diversion of gas and alleged theft from the transit system, and Russian pressure on Ukraine to hand over infrastructure in return for relief of debts accumulated over natural gas transactions.&lt;ref name=pirani/&gt;

Gas trading was conducted under a framework of bilateral intergovernmental agreements which provided for sales, transit volumes, gas prices, gas storage, and other issues such as the establishment of production joint ventures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NG21-UkrainesGasSector-SimonPirani-2007.pdf|title=UKRAINE’S GAS SECTOR|last=Pirani|first=Simon|date=June 2007|website=Oxford Institute for Energy Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial agreements were negotiated between the relevant companies within the guidelines and dictates of that framework and supplemented by annual agreements specifying exact prices and volumes for the following year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gas sales prices and transit tariffs were determined in relationship to each other.&lt;ref name=pirani/&gt; Commercial agreements and trade relations have been non-transparent and trade has been conducted via intermediaries such as [[Itera]], [[EuralTransGaz]], and [[RosUkrEnergo]].

According to a contract between Gazprom and Naftogaz signed on 21 June 2002, payment for the transfer of Russian natural gas through the [[Natural gas transmission system of Ukraine|Ukrainian pipeline system]] had been made in exchange for no more than 15% of the gas pumped through Ukrainian territory to be taken in lieu of cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics and Complexities of Crisis Management in Ukraine: A Historical Perspective|last=Gregory Simons, Mykola Kapitonenko, Viktor Lavrenyuk, Erik Vlaeminck|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781317020523|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTECAREGTOPENERGY/34004325-1112025344408/20772948/ukrainegassector.pdf|title=Ukraine: Challenges Facing the Gas Sector|last=World Bank|first=|date=September 2003|website=THE WORLD BANK - International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contract was supposed to be valid until the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Baker &amp; McKenzie International Arbitration Yearbook 2009|last=|first=|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Russia|year=2010|isbn=9785466005950|location=|pages=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 9 August 2004, the two companies signed an addendum to the contract, according to which the amount of gas given as a payment was calculated based on a tariff of US$1.09 for the transportation of 1,000&amp;nbsp;cubic meters of natural gas over a distance of {{convert|100|km|mi}}; the addendum further stated the price of the natural gas supplied to Ukraine was to be $50 per 1,000&amp;nbsp;cubic meters (approximately $1.40 per million [[British thermal unit|Btu]]).&lt;ref name=pravda221205/&gt; This price was constant notwithstanding the gas prices in the European markets.&lt;ref name=regneum100106&gt;

==Disputes of the 1990s==
Initial disputes concerning gas debts and non-payment appeared immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} As a result of disputes over non-payments by Ukraine, Russia suspended natural gas exports several times between 1992 and 1994. This led to the illicit diversion of Russian natural gas exports from transit pipelines by Ukrainian companies and institutions in September 1993 and November 1994.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The diversion of gas was acknowledged by Ukraine, while accusations of other diversions were disputed.&lt;ref name="pirani"/&gt; In September 1993, at a summit conference in [[Massandra]], [[Crimea]], Russian President Boris Yeltsin offered to [[President of Ukraine|Ukrainian President]] [[Leonid Kravchuk]] to forgive Ukrainian debts in return for control of the [[Black Sea Fleet]] and Ukraine's nuclear arsenal.&lt;ref name=D&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} After a strong negative reaction from politicians in [[Kiev]], the idea was abandoned.&lt;ref name=pirani/&gt; An intergovernmental agreement was drafted on gas issues, including a clause stating Ukraine would permit Gazprom to participate in the privatization of Ukrainian enterprises in gas and other sectors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In March 1994, a Ukrainian deputy prime minister agreed with Russia that Gazprom could acquire a 51% stake in the pipeline system. In early 1995, Russia and Ukraine agreed to create a joint company, Gaztransit, to operate Ukraine's natural gas transit infrastructure in exchange for the cancellation of a substantial portion of Ukraine's debts to Russia. These agreements were never implemented, and in November 1995, the [[Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine|Verkhovna Rada]], Ukraine's parliament, adopted a law prohibiting the privatization of oil and gas assets.&lt;ref name=pirani/&gt;

In 1998, Gazprom and Naftohaz made a contract under which Gazprom would pay for the transit of volumes of gas, which established a link between gas prices and transit tariffs,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} but this contract did not resolve the issue of already incurred gas debts.&lt;ref name=pirani/&gt;  In 1998, Gazprom alleged that Ukraine had illegally diverted gas meant for export to other European countries and suspended exports of oil and electricity to Ukraine in 1999.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Gazprom also claimed that Ukraine's gas debt had reached $2.8&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=iea/&gt; In 2001, Deputy Prime Minister [[Oleh Dubyna]] acknowledged that in 2000 alone {{convert|8|-|7|e9m3|abbr=off}} of Russian natural gas had been diverted from export pipelines.&lt;ref name=pirani/&gt; The debt issue was settled on 4 October 2001, by the signing of an intergovernmental agreement on Additional Measures Regarding the Provision of Transit of Russian Natural Gas on the Territory of Ukraine (the 2001 Transit Agreement).&lt;ref name=iea/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; However, the next day, Ukraine's [[Naftohaz]] issued a statement confirming that Russia agreed to a 30% increase in the transit fees through Ukraine. The alleged rise in the tariff would be from $7.8 to $9.50 (or €6.6) per tonne of oil going through Ukraine in 2010. Additionally, unlike previous payments, new payments would be made in Euros as this was one of Ukraine's demands. Russia and Ukraine also agreed on the volume of oil to be transported through Ukraine. The overall amount of oil to be transported to Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Hungary through Ukraine in 2010 will be 15&amp;nbsp;million tonnes—a decrease from 17.1&amp;nbsp;million tonnes in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

==2010 natural gas agreement==
{{Main|2010 Ukrainian–Russian Naval Base for Natural Gas treaty}}

===Prologue===
After meeting her [[Prime Minister of Russia|Russian counterpart]] Putin, Ukrainian Prime Minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko|Tymoshenko]] declared on 3 September 2009, "Both sides, Russia and Ukraine, have agreed that at Christmas, there won't be [any halt in gas supplies], as usually happens when there are crises in the gas sector. Everything will be quite calm on the basis of the current agreements".&lt;ref name="UNIAN292009"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Tymoshenko also said that the Ukrainian and Russian premiers had agreed that sanctions would not be imposed on Ukraine for the country buying less gas than expected and that the price of Russian gas transit across Ukraine may grow 65% till 70% in 2010.&lt;ref name="Interfax-Ukraine392009"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October 2009 Tymoshenko announced that Ukrainian 2010 natural gas imports will be significantly less than in previous years "because we have less need for natural gas". Because of its [[2008–2009 Ukrainian financial crisis|economic recession]] the [[Economy of Ukraine|industries]] require far less gas. In response to Tymoshenko [[Gazprom]] Chief Executive [[Alexey Miller]] stated that Ukraine should stick to the January (2009) contract for 2010.&lt;ref name="Kyiv Post8102009"/&gt;

On 16 November 2009 [[Commissioner for Energy]] at the [[European Commission]] [[Andris Piebalgs]] stated that Russia and the European Union do not expect another gas conflict with Ukraine. According to him there were no gas price negotiations or questions other than that of gas payments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/52863/ Andris Piebalgs: Russia, EU don’t expect another gas conflict with Ukraine], ''Kyiv Post'' (16 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2009, the gas deal of 18 January 2009, was altered after a meeting between Tymoshenko and Putin in [[Yalta]]; meaning Ukraine would not be fined for buying less gas then the old contract stipulated, this was done in view of the [[2008–2009 Ukrainian financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8369705.stm Russia agrees to ease Ukraine gas supply terms], BBC News (20 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November 2009 Gazprom and Naftohaz signed these supplements to the contract of 19 January 2009 on the purchase and sale of natural gas; according to the supplements, the annual contracted amount of gas to be supplied to Ukraine in 2010 has been set at {{convert|33.75|e9m3|abbr=off}}, instead of the {{convert|52|e9m3|abbr=off}} contracted earlier. The documents signed by the sides also stipulated that there will be no fines related to the amount of gas consumed by Naftohaz in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/25980/ "Gazprom will cut gas supplies to Ukraine in 2010, won't fine for under-consumption in 2009"], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (24 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Over the first ten months of 2009 Naftohaz has purchased {{convert|18.85|e9m3|abbr=off}} of gas with the contracted volume being {{convert|31.7|e9m3|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/53568/ "Naftogaz has to buy 27 bcm of gas in 2010 to avoid paying fine to Gazprom"], ''Kyiv Post'' (25 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2009, Russian Energy Minister [[Sergei Shmatko]] stated he expects no problems with Ukraine over gas supplies at New Year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/55154/ Russia energy minister sees no New Year gas war with Kyiv], ''Kyiv Post'' (15 December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agreement===
Ukrainian [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] [[Mykola Azarov]] and Energy Minister [[Yuriy Boyko]] were in Moscow late March 2010 to negotiate lower gas prices; neither clearly explained what Ukraine was prepared to offer in return.&lt;ref name=Yanusell&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/business/bus_general/detail/63041/ Big plant on sale block for small price], ''Kyiv Post'' (2 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Following these talks Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin stated that Russia was prepared to discuss the revision of the price for [[natural gas]] it sells to Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/62584/ Azarov: Ukraine to continue working to amend gas agreements with Russia], ''Kyiv Post'' (26 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in Kharkov - 21 April 2010-9.jpeg|thumb|250px|Signing of the deal reached at the [[Kharkiv]] summit on 21 April 2010 by [[Dimitry Medvedev]] and [[Viktor Yanukovych]]]]
On 21 April 2010, Russian [[President of Russia|President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and [[President of Ukraine|Ukrainian President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] signed an agreement&lt;ref name=cnn21410&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/04/21/russia.ukraine/index.html?hpt=T2 "Russia, Ukraine agree on naval-base-for-gas deal"], CNN (21 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; in which Russia agreed to a 30 percent drop in the price of [[natural gas]] sold to Ukraine. Russia agreed to this in exchange for permission to extend [[Black Sea Fleet|Russia's lease of a major naval base]] in the Ukrainian [[Black Sea]] port of [[Sevastopol]] for an additional 25 years with an additional five-year renewal option (to 2042-47).&lt;ref name=MT21410&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/deal-struck-on-gas-black-sea-fleet/404501.html "Deal Struck on Gas, Black Sea Fleet"], ''[[The Moscow Times]]'' (21 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2010 Ukraine pays Gazprom around $234/mcm (thousand cubic meter).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE65H0DE20100618 UPDATE 2-Russia threatens to cut Belarus gas supplies Monday], [[Reuters]] (18 June 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

This agreement was subject to approval by both the [[Russian parliament|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian parliament|Ukrainian]] parliaments.&lt;ref name=MT21410/&gt; They did ratify the agreement on 27 April 2010.&lt;ref name=rats/&gt; The [[Ukrainian parliament]] ratified it after several eggs  were thrown towards the [[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada|speaker]], [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]], by deputies and other incidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/65103/ Ukrainian parliament ratifies agreement extending Russian Black Sea Fleet's presence in Crimea], ''Kyiv Post'' (27 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/65113/ "Oppositional deputies throw eggs in Lytvyn"], ''Kyiv Post'' (27 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/65109/ "Police clash with protesters in front of Ukrainian parliament"], ''Kyiv Post'' (27 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Opposition (politics)|Opposition]] members in Ukraine and Russia expressed doubts the agreement would be fulfilled by the Ukrainian side.&lt;ref name=rats&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/65128 "Update: Ukraine, Russia ratify Black Sea naval lease"], ''Kyiv Post'' (27 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/65154/ "Agreement on Black Sea Fleet may be denounced, says Yatseniuk"], ''Kyiv Post'' (27 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Yanukovych has defended the agreement as a tool to help stabilise the state budget.&lt;ref name=whysign&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/66624/ "Yanukovych snipes at opponent, defends fleet move"], ''Kyiv Post'' (13 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition members in Ukraine described the agreement as a sell out of national interests.&lt;ref name=whysign/&gt;

In February 2014, Ukraine's [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned]] oil and gas company [[Naftogaz]] sued [[Chornomornaftogaz]] for delayed debt payments of 11.614&amp;nbsp;billion UAH (almost €1&amp;nbsp;billion) in the Economic Court of the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]].&lt;ref name=unian180314&gt;{{cite news | url = http://economics.unian.net/energetics/897959-naftogaz-trebuet-chtobyi-chernomorneftegaz-vernul-116-mlrd-griven.html

&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, Russia's energy minister [[Alexander Novak]] said that Gazprom would finance an undersea gas pipeline to Crimea.&lt;ref name=arshad/&gt;

On 11 April 2014 the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]]'s [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC) announced that it had added Chornomornaftagaz to the [[Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List]] as part of the third round of U.S. sanctions.&lt;ref name=treasury110414&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2355.aspx  | title = Treasury Designates Seven Individuals And One Entity Contributing To The Situation In Ukraine | publisher = [[United States Department of the Treasury]] | date = 2014-04-11 | accessdate = 2014-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reuters]] quoted an [[Source (journalism)#anonymous sources|anonymous]] U.S. official who explained that the United States wanted to make it impossible for Gazprom to "have dealings with Chornomorneftegaz", and if that were to happen, Gazprom itself could face sanctions.&lt;ref name=arshad&gt;{{cite news|last=Mohammed|first=Arshad|title=U.S. sanctions Crimea gas company, in move aimed at Gazprom|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/11/ukraine-crisis-usa-idUSL2N0N31IN20140411|newspaper=Reuters|date=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===June 2014 gas supplies to Ukraine cut off===
In an attempt at [[energy security|energy independence]], Naftogaz signed a pipeline access deal with [[Slovakia]]'s [[Eustream]] on April 28, 2014. Eustream and its Ukrainian counterpart Ukrtransgaz, owned by [[Naftogaz]], agreed to allow Ukraine to use a never used (but aging, at 20 years old) pipeline on Slovakia's eastern border with [[Uzhhorod]] in [[western Ukraine]]. The deal would provide Ukraine with 3 billion cubic meters of natural gas beginning in autumn of 2014 with the aim of increasing that amount to 10 billion cubic meters in 2015.&lt;ref name=norman/&gt;

On 1 April 2014 [[Gazprom]] cancelled Ukraine's natural gas discount as agreed in the [[17 December 2013 Ukrainian–Russian action plan]] because its debt to the company had risen to $1.7 billion since 2013.&lt;ref name=GWBBC16614/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-01/gazprom-raises-gas-export-price-as-ukraine-looks-for-cash.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Elena | last=Mazneva | title=Gazprom Raises Gas Export Price as Ukraine Looks for Cash | date=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month the price “automatically” jumped to $485 per 1,000 cubic meters because the Russian government annulled an export-duty exemption for Gazprom in place since the [[2010 Kharkiv Pact]] (this agreement was denounced by Russia on 31 March 2014&lt;ref name=ITBSTd&gt;[http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/725964 State Duma approves denunciation of Russian-Ukrainian agreements on Black Sea Fleet], [[ITAR-TASS]] (31 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name=GWB16614/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-03/russia-to-charge-ukraine-more-than-germany-as-gas-discounts-end.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Elena | last=Mazneva | title=Russia to Charge Ukraine More Than Germany as Gas Discounts End | date=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 June 2014 Gazprom stated that Ukraine's debt to the company was $4.5 billion.&lt;ref name=GWB16614/&gt; On 30 May 2014 Ukraine paid $786 million to Gazprom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/world/europe/russia-and-ukraine-in-talks-over-gas-supplies.html?_r=0 Russia and Ukraine Keep Talks Alive in Gas Feud], [[New York Times]] (MAY 30, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reaction in Ukraine==
{{Main|Remember about the Gas – Do not buy Russian goods!}}
{{See also|Do not buy Russian goods!}}
Political pressure from Russia to Ukraine led to the emergence of a public campaign to boycott Russian goods in Ukraine during the [[2005–06 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute|gas conflict of 2005–2006]]. Active actions in the campaign also continued in early 2009—during the [[2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute|gas war of 2008–2009]].

'''Spring soup''' is a [[soup]] made with ingredients that are only in season for a short period during spring.&lt;ref&gt;Dipping, Caroline. (April 30, 2008) ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' [http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20080430/news_1f30readers.html "Spring soup has a limited season."] Section: Lifestyle; Page E2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[asparagus]] largely characterizes spring soup,&lt;ref name="bowl"&gt;Burckhardt, Ann. (April 3, 1988) [[Star Tribune]] ''Springtime soups that'll bowl you over.'' Section: Taste; Page 15E.&lt;/ref&gt; spring soup may include just about any spring vegetable added to a [[broth]], [[chowder]], or [[Bisque (food)|bisque]].&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Russ. (February 27, 2008) [[Los Angeles Times]] ''[http://www.latimes.com/features/food/la-fo-calcook27feb27,1,7713837.story The California cook: Ready to get fresh? A spring soup flirtation.]'' Section: Food; Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Spring soup is popular largely because it includes fresh ingredients not seen for a while by the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;Snedaker, Kit. (May 23, 1994) [[New Jersey Record]] ''A bowl of spring's freshness.'' Page B3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Where winter soups are hearty to "warm and fortify", spring soups aim to celebrate "new skies and freshness" by being "delicate and light, pretty and promising."&lt;ref&gt;Winnecke, Joycelyn. (April 17, 1999) [[Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers|Vero Beach Press Journal]] ''Spring Soups: Bright, light, tested for taste.'' Section: Lifestyle; Page C4.&lt;/ref&gt; Spring soups need lighter, brighter tastes and textures than their winter counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Kapoor, Sybil. (May 13, 2007) [[The Sunday Times]] ''Liquid lunch;Cooking;Food &amp; Drink.'' Section: Features; Page 48.&lt;/ref&gt; A reason for this is that spring soups "capture the essence of the season in a clean-tasting, refreshing broth that showcases the pure flavors" of its ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;Bianco, Marie. (April 22, 1987) [[Newsday]] ''[https://news.google.com/archivesearch?hl=en&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=A+spring+soup+needs+to+capture+the+essence+of+the+season+in+a+clean-tasting,+refreshing+broth+that+showcases+the+pure+flavors+of+these+ingredients Put some spring in your soup.]'' Section: Food; Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ingredients used in spring soup include a [[purée]] of [[pea]], [[asparagus]], [[rapini]], and [[fennel]],&lt;ref&gt;Kates, Joanne. (June 2, 2007) [[The Globe and Mail]] ''Karuchie a real gamble.'' Section: Globe Style; Page L10.&lt;/ref&gt; with asparagus being considered the quintessential spring vegetable to largely characterize spring soup.&lt;ref name="bowl"/&gt; Spring soups typically show a subtle green color to reflect spring.&lt;ref&gt;Scattergood, Amy. (March 15, 2006) [[Los Angeles Times]] ''[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1003264491.html?dids=1003264491:1003264491&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Mar+15%2C+2006&amp;author=Amy+Scattergood&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Simplicity%3A+let+it+rule%3B+Insanely+good+dishes+that+are+a+snap+to+make%3F+We+kid+you+not.&amp;pqatl=google Simplicity: let it rule; Insanely good dishes that are a snap to make?

==History==
In 1828, ''[[The British Almanac]]'' provided [[Household management|housekeepers]]' information to add spring soup to a July menu.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The British Almanac]]'': By The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (Great Britain). (1828) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=UXQ3AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=spring+soup+date:1821-1830&amp;dq=spring+soup+date:1821-1830&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;pgis=1 Housekeepers' Information]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, the [[Holland Society of New York]] published a spring soup recipe that included [[amontillado]], [[olives]], [[almonds]], [[chicken]], and [[radishes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Holland Society of New York]] (1765) ''[https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;q=Spring+Soup.+AMONTILLADO.+Olives.+Almonds.+Radishes+Chicken+Halibut&amp;btnG=Search+Books Year Book of the Holland Society of New-York By Holland Society of New York Vol. for 1886/87.]'' Original from the University of Virginia. Digitized Aug 21, 2007. (Includes the Annual dinner of the Holland Society of New-York)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, spring soup was defined as a soup having a stock with any spring vegetables added that have first been [[parboiled]] in water, with the soup often colored with [[caramel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Foote Henderson|Henderson, Mary Foote]]. (1898) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vnAEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=spring+soup#PPA85,M1 Practical Cooking and Dinner Giving: A Treatise Containing Practical Instructions in Cooking.]'' Publishers: Harper &amp; brothers.&lt;/ref&gt;

 --&gt;'''Subnivean climate''' (From [[Latin language|Latin]] for "under" (''[[wikt:sub|sub]]-'') and "of snow" (''[[wikt:niveus|niveus]]'') and English -an&lt;ref&gt; https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/subnivean &lt;/ref&gt;. This is the environment of many [[winter|hibernal]] animals, as it provides insulation and protection from predators. The subnivean climate is formed by three different types of snow metamorphosis: destructive metamorphosis, which begins when snow falls; constructive metamorphosis, the movement of [[water vapor]] to the surface of the snowpack; and melt metamorphosis, the [[melting]]/[[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] of snow to water vapor and its refreezing in the snowpack. These three types of metamorphosis transform individual [[snowflake|snowflakes]] into ice crystals and create spaces under the snow where small animals can move.

== Subnivean fauna==
Subnivean [[fauna]] includes small mammals such as [[mouse|mice]], [[vole]]s, [[shrew]]s, and [[lemming]]s that must rely on winter snow cover for survival. These mammals move under the snow for protection from heat loss and some predators. In winter regions that do not have [[permafrost]], the subnivean zone maintains a temperature of close to 32°F (0°C) regardless of the temperature above the snow cover, once the snow cover has reached a depth of six inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) or more. The sinuous tunnels left by these small mammals can be seen from above when the snow melts to the final inch or so.

Some winter predators, such as [[fox]]es and large [[owl]]s, can hear their prey through the snow and pounce from above. [[Ermine]] (stoats) can enter and hunt below the snowpack. [[Snowmobile]]s and [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]]s can collapse the subnivean space. Skis and snow shoes are less likely to collapse subnivean space if the snowpack is deep enough.

Larger animals also use subnivean space.  In the Arctic, [[ringed seal]]s have closed spaces under the snow and above openings in the ice.  In addition to resting and sleeping there, the female seals give birth to their pups on the ice.  Female [[polar bear]]s also den in snow caves to give birth to their young. Both types of dens are protected from exterior temperatures. Formation of these large spaces is from the animals' activity, not ground heat.

==Subnivean climate formation==
=== Deconstructive metamorphosis ===
Deconstructive metamorphosis begins as the snow makes its way to the ground, often melting, refreezing, and settling. Water molecules become reordered, causing the snowflakes to become more spherical in appearance.&lt;ref name=halfpenny&gt;{{Cite book
  | last1 = Halfpenny | first1 = James
  | last2 =Ozanne   | first2 = Roy
  | title = Winter: An Ecological Handbook
  | publisher = Johnson Publishing Company
  | year =1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; These melting snowflakes fuse with others around them, becoming larger until all are uniform in size.  While the snow is on the ground, the melting and joining of snow flakes reduces the height of snowpack by shrinking air spaces, causing the density and mechanical strength of the snowpack to increase. Freshly fallen snow with a [[density]] of 0.1 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; has very good insulating properties; however as time goes on, due to destructive metamorphism, the insulating property of the snowpack decreases, because the air spaces between snowflakes disappear. Snow that has been  on the ground for a long period of time has an average density of 0.40 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and conducts heat well; however, once a base of 50&amp;nbsp;cm of snow with a density around 0.3 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; has accumulated, temperatures under the snow remain relatively constant because the greater depth of snow compensates for its density. Destructive metamorphosis is a function of time, location, and weather.  It occurs at a faster rate with higher temperatures, in the presence of water, under larger temperature gradients (e.g., warm days followed by cold nights), at lower elevations, and on slopes that receive large amounts of [[solar radiation]]. As time goes on, snow settles, compacting air spaces, a process expedited by the packing force of the wind.&lt;ref name="marchand"&gt;{{Cite book

Compaction of snow reduces the penetration of long- and short-wave radiation by reflecting more radiation off the snow. This limitation of light transmission through the snowpack decreases light availability under the snow. Only 3% of light can penetrate to a depth of 20&amp;nbsp;cm of snow when the density is 0.21 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. At a depth of 40&amp;nbsp;cm, less than 0.2% of light is transmitted from the snow surface to ground below.  This decrease in light transmission occurs up to the point at which critical compaction is reached.  This occurs because the surface area of the ice crystal decreases and it causes less refraction and scattering of light. Once densities reach 0.5 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, total surface area is reduced, which in turn reduces internal refraction and allows light to penetrate deeper into the snowpack.&lt;ref name="marchand"/&gt;

=== Constructive metamorphosis ===
Constructive metamorphosis is caused by the upward movement of water vapor within the snowpack. Warmer temperatures are found closer to the ground because it receives heat from the core of the earth. Snow has a low [[thermal conductivity]], so this heat is retained, creating a temperature gradient between the air underneath the snowpack and the air above it. Warmer air holds more water vapor. Through the process of sublimation, the newly formed water vapor travels vertically by way of diffusion from a higher concentration (next to the ground) to a lower concentration (near the snowpack surface) by traveling through the air spaces between ice crystals.&lt;ref name=hindelang&gt;{{Cite web
  | last = Hindelang
  | first = Mary
  | title = The Science of Winter Ecology
  | url=http://www.ed.mtu.edu/esmis/winter/ecology.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the water vapor reaches the top of the snowpack, it is subjected to much colder air, causing it to condense and refreeze, forming ice crystals at the top of the snowpack that can be seen as the layer of crust on top of the snow.

===Melt metamorphism===
Melt metamorphism is the deterioration of snow by melting.  Melting can be stimulated by warmer [[ambient temperature]]s, rain, and fog.  As snow melts, water is formed and the force of gravity pulls these molecules downward.  En route to the ground, they refreeze, thickening in the middle stratum. During this refreezing process, energy is released in the form of latent heat. As more water comes down from the surface, it creates more heat and brings the entire snowpack column to near equal temperature.  The [[firn|firnification]] of the snow strengthens the snowpack, due to the bonding of grains of snow.  Snow around trees and under canopies melts faster due to the reradiation of long-wave radiation.  As snow gets older, particles of impurities (pine needles, soil, and leaves, for example) accrue within the snow.  These darkened objects absorb more short-wave radiation, causing them to rise in temperature, also reflecting more long-wave radiation.

'''Termination''', as used by [[Quaternary]] [[geologist]]s, [[oceanographer]]s, and [[paleoclimatologist]]s is the period of time during a glacial cycle when there is a relatively rapid transition from full [[glacial]] climates to full [[interglacial]] climates. For the [[Quaternary |Quaternary period]], terminations are numbered using [[Roman numerals]] from the most recent termination as “I” and with increasing value, e.g. “II”, “III”, and so forth, into the past. Termination I, also known as the Last Glacial Termination, is the end of [[Marine isotope stage]] 2; Termination II is the end of [[Illinoian (stage)|Marine Isotope Stage 6]]; Termination III is the end of Marine Isotope Stage 8; Termination IV is the end of Marine Isotope Stage 10, and so forth.&lt;ref name="Paillard2009a"&gt;Paillard, D.

Science. 328:1652-1656.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Quaternary, global climate experienced a recurring pattern of ice-sheet growth and decay. The length of Late Quaternary cycles varied between 80,000 and 120,000 years, with an average recurrence interval of about 100,000 years. The typical Late Quaternary glacial cycle was  asymmetric having a long cooling interval that was characterized by an oscillating buildup of ice sheets to maximum volume. The long cooling interval was then followed by a relatively short warming period. During this warming period, called a ''termination,''&lt;ref name="BroeckerOthers1970a"&gt;Broecker, W.S., and J. van Donk (1970) ''Insolation changes, ice volumes and the O18 record in deep-sea cores.''

In case of the termination of the last glacial cycle, the retreat of continental ice sheets in the Northern hemisphere began about 20,000 calendar years ago. By about 7,000 calendar years ago, a small [[ice cap]] on [[Baffin Island]] was all that was left of the great Laurentide Ice Sheet that had once covered northern North America. In Antarctica, the last termination began about 18,000 years ago and interglacial climate was attained close to 11,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Paillard2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DentonOthers2010a"/&gt;

'''The Diamond Troupe''' was the concert party of the [[29th Division (United Kingdom)|29th Division]], a First World War infantry division within the British Army. Also known as the "Incomparable Division", the 29th was formed in 1915 by combining units that had previously been acting as garrisons about the British Empire. The division fought throughout the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] and, from 1916 to the end of the war, on the Western Front in France.

[[Concert party (entertainment)|Concert parties]] were an integral element of the war effort; and by 1917, virtually every division had at least one. They mirrored the [[Pierrot]] troupes of music halls and seaside resorts, offering soldiers a respite from war, reminding them of home, and providing a neutral outlet to air grievances about "food, conditions, and sergeants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Larry|title=War Culture: WWI Theatre. Military History Monthly|url=http://www.military-history.org/articles/war-culture-wwi-theatre.htm|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Diamond Troupe was one of a small number of concert parties to achieve considerable notoriety, both on the battlefield and at home. Its success was due to a combination of factors, not the least of which were the fame of the Division itself and the exceptional performances of many troupe members, especially by what historian Larry J Collins described as "the show-stopper": the female impersonator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Larry|title=War Culture: WWI Theatre. Military History Monthly|url=http://www.military-history.org/articles/war-culture-wwi-theatre.htm|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The troupe's music director, Robert James Stannard, wrote in his diary that "…the biggest hits were [Alec] Hill with his fine singing, Queenie [the troupe’s female impersonator], who deceived a great many of the audience and Larry Nicol, the trick cyclist…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Somerset Standard|title=Looking Back: 'Honour to perform for the Queen in matinee show'|url=http://www.fromestandard.co.uk/Honour-perform-Queen-matinee/story-24568226-detail/story.html#UMPBAokRqY08xOmV.99|website=Frome Standard|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason Wilson, in his history of the well-known Canadian concert party, the Dumbbells, singled out the Diamond Troupe as being one of the "notable concert parties of the British Expedition Forces"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Jason|title=Soldiers of Song: the Dumbells and other Canadian concert parties of the First World War|date=2012|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|location=Waterloo}}&lt;/ref&gt; – an assessment presaged in the 1919 edition of ''The Stage'', where the Diamond Troupe, along with the Australian troupe, Anzac Coves, were praised for having earned their applause "… by legitimate artistic means, and not on account of the increased wartime popularity of khaki or blue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Lionel|title="The Stage" Year Book|date=1919|publisher="The Stage" Offices|location=London|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==

The Diamond Troupe was formed in April 1917 in [[Arras]], France where the 29th Division’s headquarters and various details were billeted. There, amidst ruins and the sound of distant shelling, the first voice trials took place. Out of 60 candidates drawn from every unit in the Division, eight were initially selected. Most if not all troupe members had had some previous experience in the performing arts; and all had served either in the trenches or within striking distance of enemy guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Royal Court Theatre|title="A Show from the Trenches" Programme}}&lt;/ref&gt; One member, Pte. Neville Giordano (1892–1958) from Cambridge, had been part of the Division's historic landing on the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli Peninsula]] on 25 April 1915.

The name “Diamond Troupe” was inspired by the 29th Division’s logo, a red half-diamond, and by the tactical superiority of the [[diamond formation]] in a military advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gillon|first1=Stair|title=The Story of the 29th Division: A record of gallant deeds|date=1925|publisher=Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons, Ltd.|location=London|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==

Maintaining a full cast was a persistent challenge for all concert troupes, given the movement of battalions and the ever-increasing casualty list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Larry|title=War Culture: WWI Theatre. Military History Monthly|url=http://www.military-history.org/articles/war-culture-wwi-theatre.htm|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no evidence of fatalities among members of the Diamond Troupe, contemporary photographs and published cast lists do suggest some variation in the group’s composition.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Pollard was wounded in January 1916 at the Battle of Loos; Pte. Larry Nicol was wounded at St. Jean  on 4 July 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; The following table includes all individuals (musicians and stage performers) ever reported as troupe members:

Supporting the stage performers were several "stage hands" whose responsibilities extended from lighting to costumes and carpentry. They included L/Cpl. Frank R. Williams (Scenic Artist), Privates J. Price, F. Ball and J. McKinnon (Electricians), Dr. Evans (Carpenter), Pte. W. Brinsley (Costumes), Pte. J. Ross (Engineer) and Pte. Wilson (Assistant). 

Finally, no account of the Diamond Troupe would be complete without acknowledging its commanding officer, Lt. Col. Ernest Trevor Langebear Wright, DSO (1880–1965).  A veteran of the Gallipoli landing, Wright assumed command of the troupe in August 1917, following the departure of its former commander, Major John Graham Gillam (1884–1965). Wright was an exceptional leader who possessed authority, organizational skills and the respect of those who served under him. It was he who organized the troupe’s singular performance in London in January 1918, foregoing his home leave to supervise the event.

== Performances ==
While no complete listing exists of all the Diamond Troupe's performances, certainly the most comprehensive can be found in Capt. Stair Gillon’s ''The Story of the 29th Division. A record of gallant deeds''. His account, along with documentation now housed in public and private collections, reveals a busy schedule performed right across the Western Front—from Boulogne in the west, to Cambrai in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Two important repositories of Diamond Troupe materials include London’s Imperial War Museum and the University of Bristol's Mander and Mitchenson (Theatre) Collection.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Performances were given at the following locations during 1917: [[Proven]], Belgium (August/September); [[Berles-au-Bois]], France (October/November); [[Cambrai]], France (November); [[Péronne, Somme|Péronne]], France; and [[Wimereux]], France (December). During 1918, performances were given in London from January  21–26; [[Abele|Abèle]], Belgium (January/February); [[Poperinghe]], Belgium (February); an unknown location in France on March 19, 21, 23; [[Steenvoorde]], France; Vlamertinghe, Belgium; [[Boulogne]], France; [[Wallon-Cappel]], France; [[Saint-Omer]], France on June 8; [[Hazebrouck]], France (June, August); [[Roubaix]], France and Poperinghe, Belgium (October); [[Tubize]], Belgium on November 22; and in [[Wermelskirchen]], Germany (December).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like their counterparts in other divisions, the Diamond Troupe was supported financially by the 29th Division. As a result, the revenues from admission fees typically went to charities such as the Division’s Benevolent Fund, which supported the families of soldiers and non-commissioned officers either killed in action or disabled.  At most public performances, such as those held in 1918 in Saint-Omer, audiences had their choice of open or reserved seats, with officers paying double the amount paid by other ranks.
=== Royal Court Theatre, London ===
The troupe’s most publicized performance took place during the week of 21–26 January 1918 at London's [[Royal Court Theatre]]. Entitled "A Show from the Trenches", the troupe showcased their efforts to "alleviate the lot of the men in the trenches" while also raising money for the Benevolent Fund. Accounts of the shows, both matinee and evening, were widely reported in the press, particularly the matinee of Thursday the 24th, which was attended by the [[Queen Alexandra|Queen Mother Alexandra]] and her daughter, [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria]]. An amusing personal account of the event is contained in Stannard’s diary. In it, he reported that the Queen "… sat in a box just opposite me … and although she sent a message after the show saying how greatly she had enjoyed it all she didn't appear to be enjoying herself a bit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Somerset Standard|title=Looking Back: Honour to perform for the Queen in matinee show|url=http://www.fromestandard.co.uk/Honour-perform-Queen-matinee/story-24568226-detail/story.html#UMPBAokRqY08xOmV.99|website=Frome Standard|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, the show was a great success, having netted the Benevolent Fund a profit of £750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gillon|first1=Stair|title=The Story of the 29th Division: a record of gallant deeds|date=1925|publisher=Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons, Ltd.|location=London|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences included the rich and famous, including what one newspaper described as "parties of stars”—renowned stage actresses, celebrities, and the wives of senior politicians and officers—who volunteered their time to sell programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Diamond Troupe's Progress|journal=The Times|date=23 January 1918|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;At the matinee performance of Monday, 21 January, the "stars" included such well-known actresses as [[Doris Keane]], [[Viola Tree]], [[Gladys Cooper]], [[Eva Moore]] and [[Renee Kelly]]. &lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Daily Mail]], many talent scouts were also to be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Art Out of War|date=5 February 1918|publisher=Daily Mail|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre manager even asked the troupe to extend their contract by another week and the [[Ministry of Munitions]] requested that they be allowed to tour various munition centers. In both cases the [[War Office]] refused, arguing that the troupe was needed back with the division.

== Repertoire ==

The London performances were representative of the troupe’s broader repertoire—an eclectic mixture of acrobatics, music and monologues, very much in line with the vaudeville performances of the time. The Royal Court Theatre programme highlighted a number of duets between the female impersonator, "Queenie" (played by William Threlfall), and troupe members Arthur Sykes, Alec Hill, and Jock McKinley. The program also included a trick cycling act by Larry Nicol; solo musical performances by Scottish comedian Frank Pollard; and several theatrical sketches and monologues by Neville Giordano.

Much of the troupe's musical repertoire included well-known, contemporary compositions such as W.T. Wrighton’s ''Sing me an English Song'', Philip Braham’s ''We’ll have a Little Cottage'' (1917), Weatherly and Wood’s ''[[Roses of Picardy]]'' (1916), Thomas J. Hewitt’s ''Alone in Love’s Garden'' (1912), and Davy Burnaby and Gitz Rice's ''A Conscientious Objector'' (1917). 

The repertoire also included original productions—designed, written and in some cases composed for the troupe itself. The troupe’s first commanding officer, Major John Graham Gillam, excelled at producing operatic scenes, many of which (such as ''Faust'') Hill and Sykes would routinely play to great acclaim. Another key contributor to the troupe’s repertoire was officer [[Lancelot Cayley Shadwell]], ASC, (1882–1963) who Gillon described as a “lyrical bard … [able to] supply the light, topical, frivolous comic matter, so dear to the average Briton”.  Typical of this genre were two songs, ''In these Hard Times'' and ''365 Days''. Shadwell also set to music by Robert James Stannard, the ''Harlequin and Columbine'' scene, which Gillon described as “… probably the most finished production of the troupe”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gillon|first1=Stair|title=The Story of the 29th Division: A record of gallant deeds|date=1925|publisher=Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons, Ltd.|location=London|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Song of the 29th Division ==

In 1917, Lancelot Cayley Shadwell wrote the lyrics to what would become the Divisional anthem, the ''Song of the 29th Division''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Song of the Twenty-Ninth Division with words by Lancelot Cayley Shadwell, the Music by Wilfred Sanderson|date=1918|publisher=Boosey &amp; Company|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sung to music by [[Wilfred Ernest Sanderson]] (1878–1935) a composer, organist and, in all likelihood, associate of the troupe's music director, Robert Stannard. During the war, performances of the ''Song of the 29th Division'' were sung exclusively by baritone Alec [Alexander] Hill.

The wartime journalist and author, Sir [[Philip Gibbs|Philip Armand Hamilton Gibbs]], described the stirring effect the song had on those in the Division.  There was, he said, “… a hush when the song was sung, for it brought back to some of the men who heard it the days of the battle in the Dardanelles and in the fields of the Somme or the quagmire of Flanders where the ghosts of brave comrades were.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gillon|first1=Stair|title=The Story of the 29th Division: A record of gallant deeds|date=1925|publisher=Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons, Ltd.|location=London|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though all but forgotten today, the ''Song of the 29th Division'' was once a recognized tune, often performed at events honoring those who had served with the Division. In 1943, for example, the song was played at the funeral of Col. Robert Quentin Craufurd who served with the Royal Scots Fusiliers on the Western Front from 1914 to 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Death of Prominent Berkhamsted Resident|journal=The Bucks Herald|date=22 January 1943|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Border vales and the Northern dales,
From the rolling wave-beat coast,
From South to North the lads stream forth,
Oh! we are the Army's boast!
And where there's a bitter fight to wage
On a field all rent and gory,
The whole world knows there the Red Sign goes,
Well famed in Britain's story.

''Oh, this is the Song of the Twenty-Ninth''
''In the East and the West you'll find it;''
''There's never a fight where the Red Sign goes''
''But it leaves its mark behind it.''

In desert sands of alien lands
Sleep our bravest and our best;
There's a Turkish hill where the flowers wave still
O'er the graves where our dear lads rest.
And wherever the red war trail's agleam,
And the battle thunders waken,
There's a tale to be told of a soul of gold
Who trod Death's path unshaken.

''Oh, this is the Song of the Twenty-Ninth

''But it leaves its mark behind it.''
&lt;/poem&gt;

With a roll of drum the Divisions come
Hot foot to the battle's blast;
When the good Red Sign swings into the line
Oh! There they'll fight to the last!
And the souls of those from the East and West,
Well famed in Britain's story,
March at our head with silent tread
To Honour and to Glory.

''Oh, this is the Song of the Twenty-Ninth,"
''On every field you'll find it;''
''For wherever the Red Triangle went''
''It left its mark behind it.''

== After the War ==

After the [[Armistice]], the 29th Division was one of several divisions chosen to march into Germany to occupy the Rhine bridgehead. In January 1919, soldiers with more than two years of foreign service were given permission to take leave and apply for demobilization at their regimental depots. In his diary, Stannard noted that he and nine other members of the troupe were among the first to do so. They were soon followed by the others, although one or two, such as Queenie, remained in Germany to be absorbed into the few remaining concert troupes. By March, however, demobilization was in full swing and most units of the 29th were down to just a few officers.

The Diamond Troupe was typical of many concert parties in that its members, even before the war, had been active in the performing arts as singers, actors, or musicians.  Not surprisingly, after returning to civilian life, many chose to pursue their artistic vocations—some full-time, some as an adjunct to more stable day jobs.

The troupe’s musical director, '''Robert J. Stannard''', who as a boy attended Westminster Abbey Choir School and sang at the 1902 coronation of [[King Edward VII]], returned to Uxbridge and his career as an organist. In 1940, he moved to Frome in Somerset where he was appointed organist and choir master for St John's Church and head of music at the Frome Grammar School for Boys and Girls.

In July 1919 '''William Threlfall''' (Queenie) returned to Liverpool where he found work as a pianist with various dance bands. He played in gigs as far afield as the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Saarbrucken]] with groups such as the Estrella Quartette, Sam Lawson’s “Elite” Orchestra, and Jack Briggs and his Band. In 1926, Threlfall went to sea as a band musician—a career that would see him sail on many of the great [[White Star Line|White Star]] and [[Cunard]] transatlantic liners, from the [[RMS Baltic]] to the [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|RMS Mauretania]] to eventually the [[RMS Aquitania]]. Ship manifests show him almost constantly at sea, with stops in Liverpool, Glasgow, Southampton, Boston, New York, Havana, and occasionally the Mediterranean. In 1938, ill health saw Threlfall return to Southampton. After a few months, he returned briefly to sea; but ultimately ceased travelling in February 1939. In 1940, at age 44, he died suddenly of a gastric ulcer.

'''Alec [Alexander] Hill''', who performed in operas and operettas before the war, returned in 1919 to his home in Bolton, Lancashire. While his workdays were spent behind a desk, he sang professionally at weekends and evenings, well into the 1950s. With the support of his pianist wife, Margaret Eliza (née) Urmson, he continued performing Faust at the 1927 Blackpool Musical Festival, the 1934 Gounod's Grand Opera at Victoria Hall, Bolton and at Queen's Hall, Wigan in 1953. He performed at the Rothesay Pavilion in Bute, the Haddon Hall Hydro, Buxton, the Odeon in Llandudno and numerous other venues across Britain.

Glasgow-born '''Larry [Lawrence] Nicol''' adopted the stage name, Larry Kemble, and embarked on an active stage career as a comedic cyclist. In 1919, he married into a well-known theatrical family, the Loydalls, and for the next 30 years, performed at the Bristol Hippodrome, London Coliseum (for the 1928 Royal Variety Performance), Glasgow’s Alhambra and Empire Theatres, and the Stoll Theatre, Kingsway, among others. In 1940, Nicol was filmed in London, doing tricks on a very tall unicycle. See the full video on [http://www.britishpathe.com/video/larry-kemble British Pathe].

'''Neville Giordano''', the troupe’s only member to have participated in the initial Gallipoli landing, returned to acting under a stage name, Neville Gordon. In February 1920, the [[Cambridge Daily News]] praised his role as Lord Fancourt Babberley in "[[Charley’s Aunt]]"; and spoke highly of his recent successes in Stanley Houghton's (1881–1913) "[[Hindle Wakes (play)|Hindle Wakes]]" and "The Younger Generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Still Running|journal=Cambridge Daily News|date=14 August 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1920, he was also filling engagements with the [[F.R. Benson]] Shakespearian Company.

Finally, Yorkshire-born '''Arthur Sykes''' returned to his home in Carlisle, Cumbria, where, for the next 40 years, he held the post of principal tenor at [[Carlisle Cathedral]]. During World War II, he, along with [[Kathleen Ferrier]], [http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Mitchell-Ena.htm Ena Mitchel] and Albert Bettany formed a quartet that played to hospitals and camps across Scotland, the Midlands and North East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Death of Noted Singer|journal=Cumberland News|date=3 November 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Sykes' funeral in 1961, the Dean of Carlisle Cathedral praised him as “… a man who used an outstanding voice to the end of his life for the glory of God and to the service of his fellow men….”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Funeral of Mr. Arthur Sykes|journal=Cumberland News|date=10 November 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reunions ==
[[File:21st Annual Dinner of 29th Division (UK) Association.jpg|thumb|Programme of the 21st Annual Dinner of the 29th Division (UK) Association, Café Royal, London]]
Given the Diamond Troupe’s reputation and success, it is all too easy to forget that as a performing unit, they existed for less than two years: from their first show under a “fine canvas theatre” in Proven in August/September 1917 to their last performance as victors in Wermelskirchen, Germany in December 1918. And then, as Gillon wrote, “the Diamond Troupe thus stole silently away…”  It is not known how often troupe members kept in touch with one another after the war nor to what extent they were called upon to join in activities associated with the 29th Division. 

In 1921, the Division Association spearheaded an effort to keep servicemen in touch with their regimental associations. Their approach called for sending out small cards every month, each containing a calendar and a poem relating to the history of the Division. In February 1921, the card included Lancelot Cayley Shadwell’s lyrics to the ''Song of the 29th Division''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=By the Way|journal=Portsmouth Evening News|date=5 February 1921|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known how long this practice was maintained.

On 25 April 1929—the fourteenth anniversary of the Gallipoli landing—the 29th Division Association held its twenty-first annual dinner at London’s Café Royal. There, Hill, Stannard, Palmer and Holmes were reunited to perform the ''Song of the 29th Division''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gallipoli Day Ceremony: Wreaths Lain at Cenotaph|journal=The Courier and Advertiser|date=26 April 1929|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A newspaper report at the time described the event as a:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... remarkable gathering of distinguished sailors and soldiers… [whose most] inspiring moment came when Mr. Alec Hill sang the song of the 29th Division. He used to sing it out there in the war days, and [it] … has never, perhaps, been cherished by so many war leaders. [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Earl Jellicoe]], [[Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Admiral Sir Roger Keyes]], [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|General Sir Ian Hamilton]], and [[Aylmer Hunter-Weston|General Sir Aylmer Hunter Weston]], among others at the top table, sang it with the infectious enthusiasm of youth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Thermal energy storage''' ('''TES''') is achieved with widely differing technologies. Depending on the specific technology, it allows excess [[thermal energy]] to be stored and used hours, days, or months later, at scales ranging from individual process, building, multiuser-building, district, town, or region. Usage examples are the balancing of energy demand between daytime and nighttime, storing summer heat for winter heating, or winter cold for summer air conditioning ([[Seasonal thermal energy storage]]). Storage media include water or ice-slush tanks, masses of native earth or bedrock accessed with heat exchangers by means of boreholes, deep [[aquifer]]s contained between impermeable strata; shallow, lined pits filled with gravel and water and insulated at the top, as well as [[eutectic]] solutions and [[phase-change material]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Saeed, R.M., Schlegel, J.P., Castano, C. and Sawafta, R., 2018. Preparation and enhanced thermal performance of novel (solid to gel) form-stable eutectic PCM modified by nano-graphene platelets. Journal of Energy Storage, 15, pp.91-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saeed, R.M., Schlegel, J.P., Castano, C., Sawafta, R. and Kuturu, V., 2017. Preparation and thermal performance of methyl palmitate and lauric acid eutectic mixture as phase change material (PCM). Journal of Energy Storage, 13, pp.418-424.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources of thermal energy for storage include heat or cold produced with [[heat pump]]s from off-peak, lower cost electric power, a practice called [[peak shaving]]; heat from combined heat and power (CHP) power plants; heat produced by renewable electrical energy that exceeds grid demand and [[waste heat]] from industrial processes. Heat storage, both seasonal and short term, is considered an important means for cheaply balancing high shares of variable [[renewable energy|renewable electricity]] production and integration of electricity and heating sectors in energy systems almost or [[100% renewable energy|completely fed]] by renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1510028112 |pmid=26598655 |pmc=4679003 |title=Low-cost solution to the grid reliability problem with 100% penetration of intermittent wind, water, and solar for all purposes |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=112 |issue=49 |pages=15060–5 |year=2015 |last1=Jacobson |first1=Mark Z. |last2=Delucchi |first2=Mark A. |last3=Cameron |first3=Mary A. |last4=Frew |first4=Bethany A. |bibcode=2015PNAS..11215060J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.01.075 |title=Smart Energy Systems for coherent 100% renewable energy and transport solutions |journal=Applied Energy |volume=145 |pages=139–54 |year=2015 |last1=Mathiesen |first1=B.V. |last2=Lund |first2=H. |last3=Connolly |first3=D. |last4=Wenzel |first4=H. |last5=Østergaard |first5=P.A. |last6=Möller |first6=B. |last7=Nielsen |first7=S. |last8=Ridjan |first8=I. |last9=Karnøe |first9=P. |last10=Sperling |first10=K. |last11=Hvelplund |first11=F.K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2013.09.012 |title=A comprehensive model for the German electricity and heat sector in a future energy system with a dominant contribution from renewable energy technologies—Part I: Methodology |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=30 |pages=1003–18 |year=2014 |last1=Henning |first1=Hans-Martin |last2=Palzer |first2=Andreas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Molten-salt technology{{anchor|Molten_salt_technology}} ==
[[Sensible heat]] of [[molten salt]] is also used for storing solar energy at a high temperature. Molten salts can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy. Presently, this is a commercially used technology to store the heat collected by [[concentrated solar power]] (e.g., from a [[Solar power tower|solar tower]] or [[solar trough]]). The heat can later be converted into superheated steam to power conventional steam turbines and generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the [[Solar Two]] project from 1995-1999. Estimates in 2006 predicted an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[Eutectic system|eutectic mixtures]] of different salts are used (e.g., [[sodium nitrate]], [[potassium nitrate]] and [[calcium nitrate]]). Experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid.

The salt melts at {{convert|131|°C|°F}}. It is kept liquid at {{convert|288|°C|°F}} in an insulated "cold" storage tank. The liquid salt is pumped through panels in a solar collector where the focused sun heats it to {{convert|566|°C|°F}}. It is then sent to a hot storage tank. With proper [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] of the tank the thermal energy can be usefully stored for up to a week.&lt;ref&gt;

==Heat storage in tanks or rock caverns==
{{see also|Steam accumulator}}
A steam accumulator consists of an insulated steel pressure tank containing hot water and steam under pressure.  As a heat storage device, it is used to mediate heat production by a variable or steady source from a variable demand for heat. Steam accumulators may take on a significance for energy storage in solar thermal energy projects.

{{see also|Hot water storage tank}}
Large stores are widely used in Scandinavia to store heat for several days, to decouple heat and power production and to help meet peak demands. Interseasonal storage in caverns has been investigated and appears to be economical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gebremedhin |first1=Alemayehu |first2=Heimo |last2=Zinko |title=Seasonal heat storages in district heating systems |url=http://talon.stockton.edu/eyos/energy_studies/content/docs/effstock09/Session_11_1_Case%20studies_Overviews/107.pdf |publisher=Linköping University |location=Linköping, Sweden |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113115243/http://talon.stockton.edu/eyos/energy_studies/content/docs/effstock09/Session_11_1_Case%20studies_Overviews/107.pdf |archivedate=2017-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat storage in hot rocks, concrete, pebbles etc==
{{Confusing|section|date=October 2017}}

Water has one of the highest thermal capacities [[Heat capacity]] - 4.2 J/(cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·K) whereas concrete has about one third of that.  On the other hand, concrete can be heated to much higher temperatures – 1200&amp;nbsp;°C by e.g. electrical heating and therefore has a much higher overall volumetric capacity. Thus in the example below, an insulated cube of about 2.8&amp;nbsp;m would appear to provide sufficient storage for a single house to meet 50% of heating demand. This could, in principle, be used to store surplus wind or PV heat due to the ability of electrical heating to reach high temperatures. At the neighborhood level, the Wiggenhausen-Süd solar development at Friedrichshafen has received international attention. This features a 12,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (420,000 cu ft) reinforced concrete thermal store linked to 4,300 m² (46,000 sq ft) of solar collectors, which will supply the 570 houses with around 50% of their heating and hot water. Siemens builds a 36 MWh thermal storage near Hamburg with 600&amp;nbsp;°C basalt and 1.5 MW electric output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utilitydive.com/news/siemens-project-to-test-heated-rocks-for-large-scale-low-cost-thermal-ener/428055/|title=Siemens project to test heated rocks for large-scale, low-cost thermal energy storage|date=12 October 2016|work=Utility Dive|accessdate=15 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013142750/http://www.utilitydive.com/news/siemens-project-to-test-heated-rocks-for-large-scale-low-cost-thermal-ener/428055/|archivedate=13 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar system is scheduled for [[Sorø]], Denmark, with 41-58% of the stored 18 MWh heat returned for the town's [[district heating]], and 30-41% returned as electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ing.dk/artikel/nyt-energilager-skal-opsamle-groen-energi-varme-sten-189135 |title=Nyt energilager skal opsamle grøn energi i varme sten |work=[[Ingeniøren]] |accessdate=26 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126163649/https://ing.dk/artikel/nyt-energilager-skal-opsamle-groen-energi-varme-sten-189135 |archivedate=26 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than pumping the liquid metal between tanks as in a molten-salt system, the metal is encapsulated in another metallic material that it cannot alloy with ([[Miscibility|immiscible]]).  Depending on the two materials selected (the phase changing material and the encapsulating material) storage densities can be between 0.2 and 2 MJ/L.

A working fluid, typically water or steam, is used to transfer the heat into and out of the MGA.

==Electric thermal storage heaters==
{{Main|Storage heater}} 
Storage heaters are commonplace in European homes with time-of-use metering (traditionally using cheaper electricity at night time). They consist of high-density ceramic bricks or [[feolite]] blocks heated to a high temperature with electricity, and may or may not have good insulation and controls to release heat over a number of hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Documents/MSc_2013/Becerril.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514072804/http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Documents/MSc_2013/Becerril.pdf |archivedate=2016-05-14 |df= }} AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF AN ELECTRICAL STORAGE HEATER&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ice-based technology==
{{Main|Ice storage air conditioning}}
Several applications are being developed where ice is produced during off-peak periods and used for cooling at later time.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} For example, air conditioning can be provided more economically by using low-cost electricity at night to freeze water into ice, then using the [[cooling capacity]] of ice in the afternoon to reduce the electricity needed to handle air conditioning demands. Thermal energy storage using ice makes use of the large [[heat of fusion]] of water. Historically, ice was transported from mountains to cities for use as a coolant. One [[metric ton]] of water (= one cubic meter) can store 334 million [[joule]]s (MJ) or 317,000 [[BTU]]s (93kWh). A relatively small storage facility can hold enough ice to cool a large building for a day or a week.

In addition to using ice in direct cooling applications, it is also being used in heat pump based heating systems.  In these applications the phase change energy provides a very significant layer of thermal capacity that is near the bottom range of temperature that water source heat pumps can operate in.  This allows the system to ride out the heaviest heating load conditions and extends the timeframe by which the source energy elements can contribute heat back into the system.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Cryogenic energy storage==
{{Main|Cryogenic energy storage}}

This uses liquification of air or nitrogen as an energy store.

A pilot cryogenic energy system that uses liquid air as the energy store, and low-grade waste heat to drive the thermal re-expansion of the air, has been operating at a power station in Slough, UK since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19785689 |title=Liquid air 'offers energy storage hope' |author=Roger Harrabin, BBC Environment analyst |date=2 October 2012 |work=BBC News, Science and Environment |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-10-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002062542/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19785689 |archivedate=2 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isentropic===
One system which was being developed by the now bankrupt UK company Isentropic operates as follows.&lt;ref name=Isentropic/&gt; It comprises two insulated containers filled with crushed rock or gravel; a hot vessel storing thermal energy at high temperature and high pressure, and a cold vessel storing thermal energy at low temperature and low pressure. The vessels are connected at top and bottom by pipes and the whole system is filled with the inert gas [[argon]].

During the charging cycle the system uses off-peak electricity to work as a [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|heat pump]]. Argon at ambient temperature and pressure from the top of the cold store is compressed [[adiabatic process|adiabatically]] to a pressure of 12 bar, heating it to around {{convert|500|C|F|sigfig=1}}. The compressed gas is transferred to the top of the hot vessel where it percolates down through the gravel, transferring its heat to the rock and cooling to ambient temperature. The cooled, but still pressurized, gas emerging at the bottom of the vessel is then expanded (again adiabatically) back down to 1 bar, which lowers its temperature to -150&amp;nbsp;°C. The cold gas is then passed up through the cold vessel where it cools the rock while being warmed back to its initial condition.

The energy is recovered as electricity by reversing the cycle. The hot gas from the hot vessel is expanded to drive a generator and then supplied to the cold store. The cooled gas retrieved from the bottom of the cold store is compressed which heats the gas to ambient temperature. The gas is then transferred to the bottom of the hot vessel to be reheated.

The compression and expansion processes are provided by a specially designed [[reciprocating compressor|reciprocating machine]] using sliding valves. Surplus heat generated by inefficiencies in the process is shed to the environment through heat exchangers during the discharging cycle.&lt;ref name=econ1406/&gt;&lt;ref name=Isentropic/&gt;

The developer claims that a round trip efficiency of 72-80% is achievable.&lt;ref name=econ1406&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/isentropics-pumped-heat-system-stores-energy-at-grid-scale |title=Isentropic’s Pumped Heat System Stores Energy at Grid Scale |accessdate=2017-06-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722101643/http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Isentropics-Pumped-Heat-System-Stores-Energy-at-Grid-Scale |archivedate=2015-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Isentropic&gt;{{cite web|title=Isentropic's PHES Technology|url=https://www.solarchoice.net.au/blog/news/thermal-electricity-storage-inspired-by-hang-gliders-211014|accessdate=16 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012044337/https://www.solarchoice.net.au/blog/news/thermal-electricity-storage-inspired-by-hang-gliders-211014|archivedate=12 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compares to &gt;80% achievable with pumped hydro energy storage.&lt;ref name=IMEchE/&gt;

Another proposed system uses [[turbomachinery]] and is capable of operating at much higher power levels.&lt;ref name=Ruer/&gt; Use of [[Phase Change Material]] (PCMs) as heat storage material would enhance the performance further.&lt;ref name=pcm/&gt;

== Endothermic/exothermic chemical reactions ==
===Salt hydrate technology===

One example of an experimental storage system based on chemical reaction energy is the salt hydrate technology. The system uses the reaction energy created when salts are hydrated or dehydrated. It works by storing heat in a container containing 50% [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) solution. Heat (e.g. from using a solar collector) is stored by evaporating the water in an endothermic reaction. When water is added again, heat is released in an exothermic reaction at 50&amp;nbsp;°C (120&amp;nbsp;°F). Current systems operate at 60% efficiency. The system is especially advantageous for [[seasonal thermal energy storage]], because the dried salt can be stored at room temperature for prolonged times, without energy loss. The containers with the dehydrated salt can even be transported to a different location. The system has a higher [[energy density]] than heat stored in water and the capacity of the system can be designed to store energy from a few months to years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rainer |first1=Klose |title=Seasonal energy storage: Summer heat for the winter |url=https://www.empa.ch/web/s604/naoh-heat-storage |publisher=Empa |location=Zurich, Switzerland |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118233147/https://www.empa.ch/web/s604/naoh-heat-storage |archivedate=2017-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the Dutch technology developer TNO presented the results of the MERITS project to store heat in a salt container. The heat, which can be derived from a solar collector on a rooftop, expels the water contained in the salt. When the water is added again, the heat is released, with almost no energy losses. A container with a few cubic meters of salt could store enough of this thermochemical energy to heat a house throughout the winter. In a temperate climate like that of the Netherlands, an average low-energy household requires about 6.7 GJ/winter. To store this energy in water (at a temperature difference of 70&amp;nbsp;°C), 23 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; insulated water storage would be needed, exceeding the storage abilities of most households. Using salt hydrate technology with a storage density of about 1 GJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 4–8 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; could be sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;MERITS project Compact Heat Storage. {{cite web |url=http://www.merits.eu/processflow |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815023540/http://www.merits.eu/processflow |archivedate=2017-08-15 |df= }} &lt;!-- original citation: "An average low-energy household has an energy demand in the winter of about 6.7 GJ/year.

Salt hydrates have a storage density of a minimum of 1 GJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (depending on operating conditions) and no loss of heat occurs during storage. Using salt hydrates, a storage volume of 4-8 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; would ideally be sufficient. The energy density of the thermochemical material will determine the precise volume of the storage system, the cost and the storage capacity. Especially for the long term, compact thermal storage is of the utmost importance. In 2050, over 70% of the current dwellings will still be present! This means that the existing houses today will have to be retrofitted with thermal storage installations in order for them to be energy neutral in 2050."--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, researchers in several countries are conducting experiments to determine the best type of salt, or salt mixture. Low pressure within the container seems favourable for the energy transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2016.06.187 |title=Thermochemical Heat Storage – from Reaction Storage Density to System Storage Density |journal=Energy Procedia |volume=91 |pages=128–37 |year=2016 |last1=De Jong |first1=Ard-Jan |last2=Van Vliet |first2=Laurens |last3=Hoegaerts |first3=Christophe |last4=Roelands |first4=Mark |last5=Cuypers |first5=Ruud }}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially promising are organic salts, so called [[ionic liquids]]. Compared to lithium halide based sorbents they are less problematic in terms of limited global resources, and compared to most other halides and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) they are less corrosive and not negatively affected by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1002/chem.201602723 |title=Calorimetric Studies and Structural Aspects of Ionic Liquids in Designing Sorption Materials for Thermal Energy Storage |journal=Chemistry: A European Journal |volume=22 |pages=16200–16212 |year=2016 |last1=Brünig |first1=Thorge |last2=Krekic |first2=Kristijan |last3=Bruhn |first3=Clemens |last4=Pietschnig |first4=Rudolf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Molecular bonds ===

Storing energy in molecular bonds is being investigated. Energy densities equivalent to [[lithium-ion batteries]] have been achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/nl201357n |pmid=21688811 |title=Azobenzene-Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes As High-Energy Density Solar Thermal Fuels |journal=Nano Letters |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=3156–62 |year=2011 |last1=Kolpak |first1=Alexie M. |last2=Grossman |first2=Jeffrey C. |bibcode=2011NanoL..11.3156K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Transport Phenomena'''''  is the first [[textbook]] about [[transport phenomena]]. It is specifically designed for [[chemical engineering]] students. The first edition was published in 1960, two years after having been preliminarily published under the title ''Notes on Transport Phenomena'' based on mimeographed notes prepared for a [[chemical engineering]] course taught at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] during the academic year 1957-1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1979/A1979HJ87300001.pdf This Week's Citation Classic] (University of Pennsylvania, Garfield Library)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bird, R.B., Stewart, W.E. and Lightfoot, E.N.|title=Notes on transport phenomena|edition=|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1958|id=LCCN 58010796}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition was published in August 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bird, R.B., Stewart, W.E. and Lightfoot, E.N.|title=Transport Phenomena|edition=Second|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=August 2001|isbn=0-471-41077-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''revised'' second edition was published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bird, R.B., Stewart, W.E. and Lightfoot, E.N.|title=Transport Phenomena|edition=Revised Second|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2007|isbn=978-0-470-11539-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text is often known simply as ''BSL'' after its authors' initials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engr.wisc.edu/che/bsl.html Bird, Stewart, Lightfoot Programs] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20040517201621/http://www.engr.wisc.edu/che/bsl.html |date=2004-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

As the chemical engineering profession developed in the first half of the 20th century, the concept of "[[unit operations]]" arose as being needed in the education of undergraduate chemical engineers. The theories of mass, momentum and energy transfer were being taught at that time only to the extent necessary for a narrow range of applications. As chemical engineers began moving into a number of new areas, problem definitions and solutions required a deeper knowledge of the fundamentals of [[transport phenomena]] than those provided in the textbooks then available on unit operations.

In the 1950s, [[Robert Byron Bird|R. Byron Bird]], Warren E. Stewart and [[Edwin N. Lightfoot]] stepped forward to develop an undergraduate course at the University of Wisconsin–Madison to integrate the teaching of [[fluid flow]], [[heat transfer]], and [[diffusion]]. From this beginning, they prepared their landmark textbook ''Transport Phenomena''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engr.wisc.edu/che/bsl.html Bird, Stewart, Lightfoot Programs] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20040517201621/http://www.engr.wisc.edu/che/bsl.html |date=2004-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engr.wisc.edu/cbe/cbe-bird-stewart-lightfoot-programs.html Transport Phenomena: A Landmark in Chemical Engineering Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909052632/http://www.engr.wisc.edu/cbe/cbe-bird-stewart-lightfoot-programs.html |date=2015-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Word play==

''Transport Phenomena'' contains many instances of hidden messages and other word play.
For example, the first letters of each sentence of the Preface spell out "This book is dedicated to O. A. Hougen." while in the revised second edition, the first letters of each paragraph spell out "Welcome". The first letters of each paragraph in the Postface spell out "On Wisconsin".  In the first printing, in Fig. 9.L (p.&amp;nbsp;305) "Bird" is typeset safely outside the furnace wall.

== Advantages of the first edition over the second edition ==
According to many chemical engineering professors, the first edition is much better than the second edition. There are many reasons in this regard; The second edition has been revised many times despite the fact that there are still many defects and typographical errors in many parts of the book. On account of revision to defects of the revised second edition book, the authors published "Notes for the 2nd revised edition of TRANSPORT PHENOMENA" on 9 Aug 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sarec-fiq.edu.ni/pmciq/che550/pdf/BSL11.pdf Notes for the 2nd revised edition of TRANSPORT PHENOMENA]&lt;/ref&gt;
